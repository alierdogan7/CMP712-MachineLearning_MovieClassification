1
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,862
Let me alone.
l´m innocent, l tell you!

2
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:37,061
She came down and did it.

3
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,968
Come on, out with it.
And no more of that goofy talk.

4
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,235
A 2-year-old wouldn´t believe
that fantastic story.

5
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,380
How did you know there was a murder
before it happened?

6
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:49,539
-Mr. Jordan? Are you there?
-Who you talking to?

7
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:52,982
-What are you mumbling about?
-We had trouble with you before.

8
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,347
When you were a fight manager
handling that guy Pendleton.

9
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:59,789
Good old Joe. The cleanest fighter
that ever lived.

10
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:01,622
Yeah, but when he died...

11
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:05,232
...you told us he came down to Earth
and got inside people´s bodies.

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,064
-He did. He did!
-And invisible Mr. Jordan, who helped.

13
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:14,231
lt´s true, l tell you. lt´s true!
True, he did. Mr. Jordan did do it!

14
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,344
Mr. Jordan, where are you?

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,944
Look, Mr. Jordan.

16
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,847
Look, are you--?

17
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,557
Mr. Jordan, are you there?

18
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,753
How long do we have to wait around
out here?

19
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:37,227
Take it easy. You´ll get your story
as soon as we break this guy.

20
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,397
Now, get this, Corkle.

21
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,059
We don´t let anybody make monkeys
out of the police force.

22
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:46,263
So unless you want us to really
go to work on you--

23
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,102
l´ll tell you everything.

24
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,176
-But it won´t make sense.
-Come on!

25
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:54,576
Well, this fellow, Danny Miller, had
a show called <i>Swinging the Muses.</i>

26
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,513
lt was all about goddesses.
He made them hot goddesses.

27
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,949
And that´s where all the trouble began.

28
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:02,385
They were rehearsing
at the Elton Theater...

29
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,025
...she heard it and came down.
Mr. Jordan did it!

30
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:08,458
-What are you talking about?
-That´s what l´m trying to tell you.

31
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,427
lt was at a dress rehearsal.
At the Elton Theater.

32
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:12,894
The Elton Theater!

33
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,796
All right, positions, everybody!

34
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,700
Make it good. You´re not here because
you carried my books to school.

35
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,239
l´ll give you my all.
Or what´s left of it.

36
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,639
Careful of those costumes.
All set, Phil.

37
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,336
Don´t drown the lyrics.
l want to hear every word.

38
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:29,745
All right, Mr. Miller. Let´s go, fellas,
and brighten it up.

39
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:01,756
Calliope, Clio!

40
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,489
Urania, Melpomene, Euterpe,
all of you!

41
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:08,362
-Terpischore, what´s happened?
-What´s the matter? Tell us.

42
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:11,027
Wait until you hear
what´s happening on Earth.

43
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:16,470
A mortal, Daniel Miller, is presenting
a musical about us, the Nine Muses!

44
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,136
-What´s disgraceful about that?
-We´ve been glorified for centuries.

45
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,614
-Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Burns!
-But this barbarian isn´t them.

46
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,619
Why, he´s portraying us in a low
and vulgar manner on a public stage!

47
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,221
And according to him, l´m nothing
but a man-chasing trollop!

48
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,259
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

49
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,086
And as for the rest of you...

50
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:39,698
...he says you´ve kissed
over three million men!

51
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:42,159
-lmagine that!
-That´s scandalous.

52
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,100
We haven´t kissed a man
in over 2000 years.

53
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,968
Except Apollo. Once.

54
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,770
And you should hear
the type of song he´s using.

55
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:53,639
<i>Take a chick like me</i>
<i>They call me Terpsichore</i>

56
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:57,716
<i>I´m the goddess of song and dance</i>
<i>I put the ants in the dancers´ pants</i>

57
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,216
Oh, no!

58
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,785
Oh, yes.

59
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,684
That could only come from America.

60
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,849
Where else? Their number one song
on the hit parade is:

61
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,962
´´Who Hit Nelly in the Belly
With a Flounder?´´

62
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,429
Who does he think inspired
Michelangelo, da Vinci, Rembrandt?

63
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,125
Do you know who he´s telling
the world we inspired?

64
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:18,237
The man who invented
the skinless weenie. A frankfurter.

65
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:20,806
A frankfurter! How ghastly.

66
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,835
You can all twiddle your thumbs,
but l´m going to do something about it.

67
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:28,675
The theater is my province.
lt belongs to me.

68
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,477
l´ll show this Miller imbecile
a thing or two.

69
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:34,815
-l´ll make him regret he was born!
-What can you possibly do?

70
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,024
He´s down there and you´re here.

71
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,851
There must be some way,
there must be.

72
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:45,630
l know! l know who can do it.
He´s just the one to help me.

73
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,667
-Who?
-He did it before, he can do it again.

74
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:50,701
Terpsichore, what´s happening
to you?

75
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:54,830
Of course, that´s it. That´s what
l´m going to do. He´s the one!

76
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,972
-Where are you going?
-Come back here!

77
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:00,079
We´ll tell Zeus!

78
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:06,877
Who do you think you are,
popping up out of nowhere?

79
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,988
Barging in on one of our busiest days!

80
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:12,683
l´m Terpsichore. l´ve come a long way
and l have to see him!

81
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,658
And l told you he has no time
for isolated cases.

82
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,924
But l´m not an isolated case.
Don´t you understand?

83
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,330
l´m Terpsichore,
goddess of song and dance!

84
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:24,335
That´s preposterous.
She´s nothing but a legend.

85
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,735
She never existed except
in Greek mythology.

86
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,102
lf you don´t take me, you won´t exist.

87
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:32,575
My dear child, don´t threaten.
What could you possibly do to me?

88
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,646
We don´t feel pain up here.

89
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,144
Here, here, you. Come back here!

90
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,489
Escort 3082 reporting, sir.

91
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:45,522
Twelve passengers in a blizzard.

92
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:47,684
-Territory?
-Southern California.

93
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,653
-Proceed.
-Granite, lrwin.

94
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,757
Somerset, Nathaniel.

95
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,131
He is the multimillionaire, sir.

96
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:01,034
-He was the multimillionaire.
-l forgot. They can´t take it with them.

97
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,477
Get your hands off me. Let me go.

98
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,505
Mr. Jordan, could l speak to you?

99
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,012
l´m awfully sorry. l did everything
in my power to stop her.

100
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,808
Why should you try to stop her?

101
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,251
She´s not like the others. She didn´t
come up through the regular channels.

102
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:20,625
-lndeed.
-l see how terribly busy you are...

103
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,762
...and l do hope l´m not intruding.

104
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,192
That´s quite all right.

105
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,657
-Proceed.
-Butler, Thomas.

106
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,631
Donahoe, Eleanor.

107
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:34,172
-Suppose you tell me what you want?
-She says she´s Terpsichore.

108
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:37,469
Of course, you and l know
that´s utterly absurd.

109
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,542
You and l don´t know any such thing.

110
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:43,740
Muses have been the personification
of the arts since ancient Greece.

111
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,249
We do only our best.

112
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,879
But nobody who is anybody has paid
attention to them for over 2000 years.

113
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:55,560
Years? Messenger 701 3,
we don´t have calendars up here.

114
00:10:55,729 --> 00:11:00,894
-l´ve tried to explain that to you.
-lt´s habit. l keep forgetting. l´m sorry.

115
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:03,298
How is everything
over on Mount Parnassus?

116
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,462
Oh, just wonderful, Mr. Jordan.
l hated to leave.

117
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,132
Because l thought it my duty,
l was able to tear myself away.

118
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,270
See, l want to go down to Earth
and get into a theatrical production.

119
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,245
You don´t know our business here.

120
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:20,376
-We bring people up, not down.
-You shut up, you.

121
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:26,559
l mean.... Well, you see, Mr. Jordan,
l know you like to help people...

122
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:29,694
...and this young man,
the producer, is all mixed up.

123
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:31,626
He doesn´t understand a goddess.

124
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,327
lf you help, l could play the goddess,
and his show would succeed, you see.

125
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,164
lsn´t that a good idea?

126
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:41,566
l must say, it´s extremely kind of you,
my dear.

127
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,675
But we can´t meddle in the financial
affairs of every man on Earth.

128
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,076
We just don´t have the staff for it.

129
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,649
-There. Mr. Jordan has spoken.
-Oh, but l--

130
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,945
But Mr. Jordan, it seems such a pity.

131
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,812
Oh, l´m certain this Mr. Miller
is a most deserving person...

132
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:59,692
...and l only want to help.

133
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:02,657
Miller. What is his given name?

134
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:04,630
Daniel.

135
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,063
Miller, Daniel.

136
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,999
lf you´ll just wait here a moment.

137
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,271
Mr. Sloan.

138
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,347
Contact the registrar´s office and ask
them for everything on Miller, Daniel.

139
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:24,541
Next time, l hope you´ll take
my advice for what it´s worth.

140
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,310
Oh, you make me tired.

141
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:29,846
l thought you couldn´t feel any pain.

142
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:31,958
l´ve got a memory, haven´t l?

143
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,357
Mr. Jordan.

144
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,693
On Miller, Daniel, the records list him
as an alternate.

145
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:43,328
-An alternate?
-He´s due here on one of two dates.

146
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,061
The first soon, the other
a number of years hence.

147
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,004
The choice depending upon
undetermined circumstances.

148
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,501
Yes, yes, of course.

149
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:54,038
l remember the whole case now.

150
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:59,844
l believe that our circumstances
have been determined for us.

151
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,016
Now, my dear.

152
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,386
You say your only interest in this...

153
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,498
...is to make Daniel Miller´s musical
a success?

154
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,164
Oh, yes, Mr. Jordan.

155
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,200
l have only his welfare at heart.

156
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:22,035
-Surely you´re not going to--
-You´ll stay till your task is completed?

157
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:26,003
-But of course.
-And then return to Mount Parnassus?

158
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,280
Oh, yes, Mr. Jordan.

159
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:31,940
Good. l will regard that as
an irrevocable promise.

160
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:35,949
You will consider this your special
assignment. Please start immediately.

161
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:40,321
Me? But Mr. Jordan, l´ve been
promising myself a vacation for years.

162
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:42,621
l mean, our kind of years.

163
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:45,228
You will forego your vacation
for the present.

164
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,264
Take this young lady down at once...

165
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:50,733
...and assist her in every possible way.
ls that perfectly clear?

166
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,369
Yes, sir.

167
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:57,909
-Thank you, you´re a darling.
-Do you mind if l collect another day?

168
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:02,905
-What are we waiting for? Let´s go.
-Just a moment.

169
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,717
l´m the one who says ´´Let´s go.´´

170
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,451
Let´s go.

171
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:31,470
We get around. One minute we´re up
there, then we´re here in New York.

172
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:35,046
-How do you do it?
-l´ll have to ask you not to pry.

173
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:37,308
While l´m here,
where am l going to live?

174
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:40,851
Take the Peach Bloom suite
at the Waldorf Plaza.

175
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:44,349
l´m sure we can figure some way
to take care of the expense.

176
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,288
Sounds like fun.

177
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,524
Why are they all hurrying so,
these Americans?

178
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:52,096
-Where are they going?
-To see Mr. Jordan.

179
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,133
Yes. The more they hurry,
the sooner they´ll get there.

180
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:56,530
Precisely.

181
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,011
701 3! Where are you?

182
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:13,282
Oh, there you are.

183
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,252
l wish you´d wait
and not go dashing about.

184
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:17,981
l´m not a racehorse, you know.

185
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,917
-Do you think you ought to be here?
-And why not?

186
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:24,689
l mean those clothes. They might
wonder who l am if l´m seen with you.

187
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:27,060
l have tried to make it clear to you...

188
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:30,795
...that you are the only one who
can see and hear Mr. Jordan and me.

189
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,700
Oh, l forgot.

190
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,769
Looking for somebody, miss?

191
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:40,804
Oh, yes, a silly-looking gentleman, he
was wearing a messenger´s uniform.

192
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,381
-He was here a minute ago.
-And he´s here now.

193
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,884
But some people can´t get it in their
heads that l can´t be seen or heard.

194
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,848
l don´t see nobody, ma´am.

195
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,582
-Thank you.
-There.

196
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:56,385
l guess that´ll show you,
you suspicious little...little....

197
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:59,023
l didn´t say it, Mr. Jordan.

198
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:02,768
A real theater!

199
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,862
l haven´t been on a stage
since 429 B.C.

200
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,735
You´re not on one yet.

201
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,467
-Terpsichore!
-Yes?

202
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,545
No, no. That´s not for you. That´s....

203
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:17,246
What is it, Calliope?
Come on, kid, give out!

204
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:21,012
An airplane. lt crashed
on the other side of Parnassus.

205
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:22,718
Any occupants?

206
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,559
-Men?
-l´ll say. Two beautiful aviators.

207
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,697
l don´t care if they´re cross-eyed,
knock-kneed...

208
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,733
...bowlegged. All l want to know is,
are they alive and healthy?

209
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:38,537
-ls she supposed to be me?
-lndubitably.

210
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:41,970
Throw them over your shoulders
and bring them in.

211
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,070
lt´s simply disgraceful.

212
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:48,040
Ambrosia. What l need is
a good slug of Scotch.

213
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,775
Now, that´s not the way l see
Terpsichore....

214
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:54,148
Why, it´s a thousand times worse
than l ever imagined.

215
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,916
-lt´s still too tame for my money.
-Too tame, did he say?

216
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,524
--trollop. She´s man-crazy!

217
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,786
That gentleman must be
Mr. Daniel Miller.

218
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:03,395
ln the flesh...

219
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,191
...temporarily.

220
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,060
Well, 701 3, this all has to be
corrected instantly.

221
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,363
You may be satisfied with
the way things are, but l´m not.

222
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,971
Oh, Mr. Jordan.

223
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,541
-Now perhaps we´ll get someplace.
-What seems to be the trouble?

224
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,804
We´ve got to get that jezebel
out of there and me in.

225
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,909
What do you suggest?

226
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,279
Why not have her break a leg?
You could do that, couldn´t you?

227
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:28,579
Don´t you think that´s a bit drastic?

228
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:31,588
Mr. Jordan, how am l going
to get into the show?

229
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,755
You are the goddess of song
and dance, aren´t you?

230
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:38,227
-Of course l am.
-Well, what´s stopping you?

231
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,495
What can l do?

232
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:45,171
Go ahead, you´ll think of something.

233
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,577
All right, Georgia,
let´s go through your dance now.

234
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:01,687
Take your places, girls,
and break it up this time.

235
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,864
lf l may be so bold, sir...

236
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:17,765
...l tell you, you´re going to rue the day
you got mixed up with that...

237
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:19,428
...that Greek.

238
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,068
-Here comes the angel.
-Angel?

239
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:34,547
Mr. Jordan, really.

240
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:38,621
´´Angel´´ is a theatrical term
for one who finances a show.

241
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:44,886
-Then he´s-- He´s--
-Joe Manion, the gambler, yes.

242
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,555
Oh, dear, dear.

243
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,102
He´s the one who will kill Miller
if the show fails?

244
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,567
Definitely.

245
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:11,283
-For the love of Pete, who´s that?
-Hold it.

246
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,400
There are times, 701 3,
when our work is quite pleasant.

247
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,596
l anticipate nothing but catastrophe.

248
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,411
What´s going on here?

249
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,326
She´s magic.

250
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,902
-lt´s fantastic! That´s Terpsichore.
-What?

251
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,462
l need a goddess and a goddess
comes down out of nowhere.

252
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,131
l wonder who she is.

253
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,876
Well, Mr. Daniel Miller,
you´ve got two of us now.

254
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:48,578
-Take your choice.
-Two of us? Choice?

255
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:51,519
-You´re about to lose some teeth.
-Hey, take it easy.

256
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:53,852
You cheap little hip-swinger.
l´d like to--

257
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:55,790
How dare you!

258
00:20:57,397 --> 00:20:59,922
l ought to have you wiped off
the face of earth.

259
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,624
-What?
-Girls, wait a minute.

260
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,635
You throw this character out
this minute or l´m walking.

261
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,136
Go ahead and walk.

262
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,366
The general tone of the theater
will go up about 200 percent.

263
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,510
Are you going to throw her out or not?

264
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,679
-You don´t see me doing it, do you?
-Then l quit.

265
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:19,581
Danny, don´t go overboard. You
looked for months for the right girl.

266
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:21,812
And this is just what l was looking for.

267
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:25,854
-l´ve heard enough. He´s gone crazy.
-No, no, stick around.

268
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:30,588
-But she´s got to know how to sing!
-Let me handle this, Eddie.

269
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,259
Honey, please say yes.
Can you sing?

270
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:40,668
Of course l can sing.
And l can act too.

271
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,510
What is this, a contest?
l´m leaving.

272
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,839
l´ve been looking for an out.

273
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,607
Since l got into this thing,
l knew it was a turkey.

274
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:53,810
-Go change and l´ll give you a check.
-That suits me fine.

275
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,387
Honey, l don´t know who you are
or where you came from but....

276
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:00,687
Mr. Manion, is this what
the show needed or isn´t it?

277
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,192
You´re rolling the dice.

278
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,159
What key do you sing in?

279
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:06,197
Any key.

280
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:10,569
-Phil, play ""Let´s Stay Young Forever.""
-Coming up.

281
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,546
That´s good enough for me.

282
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:13,488
Where did you come from?

283
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,719
l just floated down out of the clouds.

284
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:17,726
How did you know this song?

285
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:20,630
l heard it from up there.

286
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,394
Oh, you´ve been hanging around
the balcony.

287
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,629
How did you ever learn
to sing and dance?

288
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:28,569
l sang and danced like that
when l was 6 years old.

289
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,201
-What´s your name, honey?
-Terpsichore.

290
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:35,779
l mean, that´s the part in the show.

291
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:39,078
Well, yes, l know,
but what´s your name?

292
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:43,120
Kitty.

293
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,916
Kitty. That´s a pretty name.

294
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,695
l thought you were so excited you
couldn´t remember your own name.

295
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:54,857
Now, if you can calm down a little,
l´ve got a few details to settle with you.

296
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,697
-Take over, Eddie.
-All right, girls, line up.

297
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:00,238
By the way, who´s your agent?

298
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,601
-My what?
-Agent.

299
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:04,603
You´ve got an agent, haven´t you?

300
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,478
Who handles you?

301
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:09,511
-Of course l have an agent.
-Who is he?

302
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,912
Max Corkle. He´s coming in
this very moment.

303
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:13,643
He´ll be here in a moment.

304
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,447
Danny, am l lucky to get you
when you ain´t busy.

305
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:18,614
Meet Rosebud the Human Pretzel.

306
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:21,192
Stands on a six-foot ladder,
does a back bend...

307
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:23,329
...and laces her shoes with her teeth.

308
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:25,896
Max, darling!

309
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,229
lsn´t it funny, we were just talking
about him. He´s my agent.

310
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,667
l´m your agent?

311
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:36,836
-That´s what l said, l´m her agent.
-You´ll never guess what´s happened.

312
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,104
l danced in the chorus just like you
told me to and it worked.

313
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,508
Sure, sure.

314
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:43,979
ln the chorus, just like l said.

315
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,708
Max, you rascal...

316
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:50,618
...you´ve been wonderful the way
you´ve handled me all these years.

317
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:52,618
All these years.

318
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:55,283
Let´s see now.
How long has that been?

319
00:25:55,462 --> 00:26:00,024
Max, you had a girl like this up your
sleeve and never showed her to me?

320
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,398
Well, l´ll tell you, Danny, it´s like this.
l got such a big clientele.

321
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,870
Mr. Miller, l´m waiting for my check.

322
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:09,571
Excuse me a moment.

323
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:12,643
How many years am l supposed
to stand around here?

324
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:15,610
Look, sweetheart,
l didn´t know that Miss....

325
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,647
You know, my old client....

326
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:20,980
You go back to my office
and practice your bends.

327
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,219
Same old Max.
One of my favorite people.

328
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,154
Mine too. When does he join us?

329
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:29,552
Mr. Corkle is an agent.

330
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,523
That´s right. We never get them.

331
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:37,093
l´ll be around if you need me.

332
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,795
Thanks for everything-- Mr. Corkle.

333
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,567
Why are you thanking me?
l ought to be thanking you.

334
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:46,209
Say, why´d you pick me
for your agent?

335
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,313
A friend recommended you, Max.

336
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,676
-l´m glad he did.
-So am l.

337
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:53,377
l´ll have the contracts in the morning.

338
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:55,043
What´s your last name, Kitty?

339
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:57,288
lt....

340
00:26:58,224 --> 00:26:59,555
lsn´t it funny?

341
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,919
lt´s on the tip of my tongue.

342
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,827
Mine too.

343
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:07,491
What is this?
What are you two trying to hide?

344
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,167
Something in her past?

345
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:13,362
No, we had an agreement. She don´t
want anybody to know who she is.

346
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,768
Yes. That´s it.

347
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,072
Why?

348
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,681
lt´s on account of all those cows.

349
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,874
-Cows?
-Yes, my uncle in Texas.

350
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:30,785
He has millions of cows
and you know how cows multiply.

351
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:36,386
And he doesn´t want the family name
associated with the theater.

352
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:40,522
-That´s it, exactly.
-lf that´s all, we´ll just give her a name.

353
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:43,528
l know, we´ll call her Pendleton.
Kitty Pendleton.

354
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,434
Named after the greatest fighter that
ever laid on a glove, Joe Pendleton.

355
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:50,633
Came out of no place, just like you,
and wound up a champ.

356
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,835
And you´re gonna wind up a champ.
Right?

357
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:56,140
-Right.
-lt´s all set. She gets a regular salary.

358
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:59,979
The deal is on. We sign the contracts
in the morning. Thanks, Danny.

359
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,780
Well, so long, Miss....

360
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:06,018
Of course. So long, Miss Pendleton.
l´ll be seeing you around.

361
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:09,054
-Oh, Eddie. Eddie.
-Yeah?

362
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,791
About that client, give her a break.
She´s never been in a chorus before.

363
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:17,926
Are you kidding? She´s not in
the chorus. She´s playing the lead.

364
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:19,662
The lead?

365
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,670
Yeah, sure. She´s Terpsichore.

366
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:24,207
Terpsichore. The lead. The lead?

367
00:28:24,377 --> 00:28:28,871
l got 1 0 percent. l never had a lead.
l never had nothing but acrobats...

368
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:31,710
...pretzel benders, trained seals.
Now l got a star!

369
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,977
Me, Max Corkle. l got a star.

370
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:36,417
And they´re throwing me
out of my office.

371
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:41,249
They´re wiping my name off.
Now it spells ""Cork.""

372
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:44,021
l gotta go back. l gotta go back.

373
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:46,825
They´re throwing the furniture out
and l gotta go.

374
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,062
l´m still here!

375
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,303
l suppose you think it´s sort of
bold of me, pushing my way in.

376
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:59,001
l can´t say you´re a shrinking violet.

377
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:00,873
Anyway, l´m glad you did.

378
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:04,983
l promise l´ll do my best to make
your show everything it should be.

379
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:07,619
Oh, l´m sure you will. Here, sit down.

380
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:10,617
Well, l....

381
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:13,820
l....

382
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:18,094
-Why do you keep staring at me?
-Staring?

383
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:19,860
l wasn´t aware of it.

384
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:24,197
You´ve been looking at me in a
strange way ever since l came in.

385
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:29,169
Well, to tell you the truth, l do feel
something strange about you.

386
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:32,038
Why, it´s almost as if you came
from another world.

387
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:33,710
Well....

388
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,407
You were going to tell me
about the show.

389
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:41,317
l´d better give you an idea
of the story and...

390
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:46,391
-...let you hear the songs and....
-l think that might be a good idea.

391
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:48,783
Well, it....

392
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:50,991
lt´s about a....

393
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:52,528
Don´t you remember?

394
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:55,095
Yes, yes, l remember.

395
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:57,869
You see....

396
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,970
Eddie and l play a couple of
American aviators and--

397
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,574
Yes?

398
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,246
We crash on Mount Parnassus
and there we meet Terpsichore.

399
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:11,340
-You know who she is, don´t you?
-Oh, l think so.

400
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:14,519
She´s the most talented
of all the goddesses, isn´t she?

401
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:19,391
l don´t know, l never met a goddess.

402
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:23,719
The one in our show
is just an ordinary dame.

403
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:29,223
Anyway, this is the love song
l sing to you in the first act.

404
00:30:30,303 --> 00:30:31,770
You see...

405
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,505
...l fall in love with you...

406
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,105
...in the show.

407
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:38,508
The love song. Do you mind?

408
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:40,155
--and l tell you, you and everybody
else have it all wrong.

409
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:42,794
lmagining l´m this,
and imagining l´m that.

410
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:45,931
No more nonsense. Now, l wanna
know who you really are.

411
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:49,124
All right. lf you´ll just let me alone,
l´ll tell you.

412
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:51,532
Now we´re getting someplace.

413
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:54,431
l´m Terpsichore,
Grecian goddess of song and dance.

414
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,872
l didn´t land on my head as a kid.
Come on, honey, who are you?

415
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:00,535
l know it sounds ridiculous,
but that´s who l am.

416
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:04,479
You´re doing fine, but give me more
on that last line. Hit ´´ridiculous.´´

417
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,483
-Yes, Mr. Miller.
-Okay, l´ll give you the cue.

418
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:12,585
l didn´t land on my head as a kid.
Come on, honey, who are you?

419
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:16,592
l know it sounds ridiculous,
but that´s who l am.

420
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:22,027
l´m Terpsichore,
the daughter of....

421
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,600
-Of....
-Go on, Kitty.

422
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:30,341
Look, Mr. Miller, it says here ´´Zeus,´´
but it´s all wrong.

423
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:34,172
Terpsichore is not
the daughter of Zeus. My father--

424
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:39,009
-l mean, her father was Dionysus.
-No, no. Zeus.

425
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:43,485
That´s the popular belief, but l happen
to know the facts. lt´s Dionysus.

426
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,750
Please, l didn´t put this show together
with thumbtacks.

427
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:51,886
lt so happens l looked up this
particular item in the encyclopedia.

428
00:34:52,064 --> 00:34:54,624
l hate to disillusion you...

429
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,995
...but the encyclopedia is wrong.

430
00:34:57,169 --> 00:35:00,866
No kidding. You know more
than the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>?

431
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,668
About things like this, yes.

432
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:06,844
Since we´re on the subject,
you got a lot of things wrong.

433
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,408
For instance?

434
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:10,879
For instance, you´ve got me
drinking ambrosia.

435
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,451
Ambrosia´s food.
Nectar is the drink.

436
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,144
And your scenery.

437
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,689
Why, it doesn´t bear the faintest
resemblance to Mt. Parnassus.

438
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:24,228
-And as for your costumes--
-Kitty, l haven´t time to fiddle around.

439
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:28,197
Out of the chorus, l give you the lead.
Now you´re trying to run the show.

440
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:33,031
l knew about these things before your
great-great-great-grandpa was born.

441
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:34,832
Boy, you´re really a character.

442
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,534
l work late with you night after night.
All you do is give me trouble.

443
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:41,942
-Danny won´t go for much of that.
-No, of course not.

444
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:45,049
l think she must´ve went to college.
That´ll ruin anybody.

445
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,479
Come on.

446
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:00,493
Mr. Jordan.

447
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,793
What´s the reason
for this unseemly haste?

448
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:06,301
l´m sorry, sir. But it´s about that
Kitty ´´Terpsichore´´ Pendleton.

449
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:09,669
She lied to you,
brazenly, without shame.

450
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:12,106
Yes, indeed.
She´s not helping Danny Miller--

451
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:14,405
That is Miller, Daniel--
Not in the least.

452
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:19,516
She´s trying to change his entire show,
fighting like a wildcat the entire way.

453
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:21,949
-l know.
-You do?

454
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:25,420
Then surely, sir, you´ll send her
right back where she came from.

455
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:28,526
-Then you can take your vacation.
-Well, sir...

456
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:32,061
...to be perfectly frank, l did make
reservations at Paradise Lake.

457
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,722
You know how difficult
they are to get these days.

458
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,564
That, 701 3, was an unwarranted
assumption of authority on your part.

459
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,197
As soon as you have completed your
assignment with this young Muse...

460
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:46,640
...you will report to my office
for disciplinary measures.

461
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:51,579
Mr. Jordan. You´re not going to
assign me to Brooklyn again?

462
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,548
Precisely.

463
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:55,845
Oh, dear.

464
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:59,548
The nights are six months long
in Brooklyn.

465
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:06,454
What do morals mean to me?
l´m a goddess. l´m--

466
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:15,837
Oh, Danny, l just can´t say these lines.
Morals do mean something to me--

467
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:20,308
That´s all very charming, but l´m not
interested. Just stick to the script.

468
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:23,677
l can´t stand any more of this.

469
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:28,844
The whole idea of this scene is cheap
and vulgar, and so is your show.

470
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:33,151
Why, suggesting that a goddess,
or anybody else, would marry two men.

471
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:36,717
ln the name of great Jupiter!

472
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,558
lf you´re to present the Nine Muses,
you can do it...

473
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:44,431
...without stupid lines, embarrassing
costumes and idiotic sets.

474
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:47,629
Take over, Eddie.
Come along with me.

475
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,476
Max, it doesn´t look good.

476
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:55,209
And l thought l´d given up
handling fighters.

477
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,576
l could put her in the ring
with a tiger...

478
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,548
...if l could find one
that would take her on.

479
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:12,863
l want to tell you something, Kitty.

480
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:17,259
l´ve gone overboard for you.
Not only in the show, but personally.

481
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:21,395
l don´t like to talk about those things,
but you must know that´s how it is.

482
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:24,168
You certainly have a peculiar way
of showing it.

483
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,470
l´m pushing all my personal
feelings aside.

484
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,977
l´ve got to. This show means
too much to me.

485
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:33,608
What l must come up with is a good,
hot musical that´ll pack them in.

486
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:36,113
You seem to have
different ideas about it.

487
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,983
And what l´m trying to say is...

488
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:41,388
...the way you´re doing it, you´ll
have a failure, sure.

489
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:43,388
Let me worry about that.

490
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,655
Why, you lead people to believe the
show´s about Terpsichore, but it´s not.

491
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:51,166
They´ll laugh at you. She´s not
at all like you characterized her.

492
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:53,396
l made this whole show
out of thin air.

493
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:56,871
lt´s a fairy tale, and Terpsichore
is any cockeyed thing l say.

494
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,306
l´d be careful, Mr. Daniel Miller.

495
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:02,641
She might hear you say that,
and she might not like it.

496
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:04,806
Oh, she might not like it, huh?

497
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:08,784
l suppose she might come out of the
clouds and slap me across the face.

498
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:13,118
She might, if you continue to paint her
as a cheap, man-chasing trollop!

499
00:39:13,993 --> 00:39:16,655
Now get this, once and for all.

500
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:19,320
lf l say Terpsichore´s a trollop,
she´s a trollop.

501
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,537
Be on the stage in five minutes,
or you´re out of the show.

502
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:44,555
Temper, temper, temper.

503
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:46,486
You! What do you want?

504
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:49,992
-A very interesting little scene.
-Oh, go fry an egg.

505
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:53,654
My, you have come down to earth.
And right into the gutter.

506
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:56,801
l asked what you wanted.
Don´t you have other things to do?

507
00:39:56,969 --> 00:40:00,302
Nothing that´ll give me quite
the satisfaction of taking you back.

508
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:03,566
l presume from this display
of ladylike restraint...

509
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:07,803
-...that you´re amenable to the idea.
-Well, you´re presuming all wrong.

510
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,572
l´m not going back at all.

511
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:11,773
l´m going to get what l came for...

512
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,476
...if l have to smash the theater
and him with it.

513
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:18,089
The only thing you´ve smashed
so far is yourself.

514
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:21,682
Yes.

515
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:27,530
-Yes, l´ve been obvious. Crude.
-As a fishwife.

516
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:33,871
What are you up to now?

517
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,909
So the gentleman has gone
overboard for me, has he?

518
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,135
Perhaps l´ll swim around
with him a little bit.

519
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,976
None of that, now. You dare to lie
to him and lead him on, and l´ll--

520
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,347
-l´ll tell him just what you--
-You´ll do no such thing.

521
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:55,285
You can´t be seen or heard.
Remember?

522
00:40:56,061 --> 00:40:59,895
Oh, dear, dear.
That poor young man.

523
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:01,726
l guess that takes care of you.

524
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,267
Danny´s talking about throwing you--
Who you talking to?

525
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:09,765
Just the wind.
lt´s a silly little habit of mine.

526
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:12,706
Sure, lots of us got
funny habits like that.

527
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:16,314
But don´t let anybody catch you.
lt´s standing still, not blowing.

528
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:18,712
-l´ll remember that.
-About you and Danny--

529
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:20,613
-Don´t worry.
-l know, but l do.

530
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:22,686
That poor young man.

531
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:31,696
l´m sorry, Danny.

532
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,593
And Eddie.

533
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:39,227
l´ve thought it all over, and now l know
which one of us really runs the show.

534
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:45,334
All right. We´ll skip the dialogue.
Go right into the number.

535
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,308
Pick it up, will you, Phil?

536
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,878
Females.

537
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,983
One head, but two faces.

538
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:17,024
What do you think?

539
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,130
Must be the new thing
they´re talking about.

540
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:21,892
lt might work out
if you don´t hang around too much.

541
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,558
-l was thinking the same.
-Looking after my interests.

542
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:26,431
Once a pal, always a pal.

543
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:30,166
-l gotta get the knife from my back.
-l put it there before it rusted.

544
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:31,604
You kidder.

545
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:34,974
Fellas, second chorus.

546
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:25,025
-What you think?
-You with the oven, me with the lovin´.

547
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:28,655
-How about you with the oven?
-No, you´re the man for the oven.

548
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:31,302
Now, don´t move.
You´re perfect as you are.

549
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,837
-You moved.
-Let´s get back to that oven routine.

550
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:38,602
Oh, you´re in. l hear you make
a beautiful upside-down cake.

551
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,871
Love to,
but the blood rushes to my head.

552
00:45:43,148 --> 00:45:45,480
Never mind, then,
just some juice and coffee.

553
00:45:45,651 --> 00:45:47,414
-Bring it up.
-What´ll you do?

554
00:45:47,586 --> 00:45:50,248
Just dusting and brushing things off.

555
00:45:50,422 --> 00:45:53,323
Fellas. Break it up. You´re on.

556
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,941
l hate to disturb you, Danny,
but it´s confidential.

557
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:32,906
Excuse me, Kitty.

558
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:41,848
lt´s about Kitty.

559
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:44,017
What about her?

560
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,390
She´s still working on you
to change the show.

561
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,959
You keep saying that,
but it doesn´t make sense.

562
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:52,221
Why would she want to do that?

563
00:49:52,497 --> 00:49:56,763
Because she´s the kind of girl who
only plays if she has all the marbles.

564
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:03,099
Look, Eddie. We´ve had one fight
in our lives, when we were kids.

565
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:05,470
l don´t want to have
another one with you.

566
00:50:05,644 --> 00:50:07,874
Because you licked me that time.

567
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,941
Let´s just stay friends, huh?

568
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,422
l think l´ll do a little work.

569
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:31,734
-Feeling better, Eddie?
-Oh, yes, yes. l feel fine.

570
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,970
Well, we´ll see if we can´t do
something to change all that.

571
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:50,078
Do you mind?

572
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,484
What brought you out here?

573
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:57,657
-lt worked, didn´t it?
-What worked?

574
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,729
Oh, l know what Eddie told you.

575
00:50:59,898 --> 00:51:02,093
-Oh, you do, huh?
-Yes.

576
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,930
And l´ll tell you something that may
surprise you. l think he´s right.

577
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,834
Say, are we talking about
the same thing?

578
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,076
Of course.

579
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:16,270
l´ve been willful, selfish
and stubborn...

580
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,976
...and maybe a little ungrateful.

581
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:24,812
You gonna break down like that,
l guess maybe l ought to.

582
00:51:27,592 --> 00:51:32,029
l don´t mind telling you l´ve been kind
of bullheaded and stubborn myself.

583
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:37,433
But you have a right to be. After all,
what do l know about the theater?

584
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:41,470
And as you said, l´m just a little
nobody you took out of the chorus.

585
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,872
Oh, l don´t know. You´ve had
a couple of pretty good ideas.

586
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:47,443
You´re just being nice.

587
00:51:47,612 --> 00:51:51,207
l´ve been giving a lot of thought to
what you´ve been saying all along.

588
00:51:51,383 --> 00:51:54,079
Maybe the public won´t like my taste.

589
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:57,753
Maybe l´m just a Broadway mug
after all.

590
00:51:57,922 --> 00:52:00,857
No. You´re an artist.

591
00:52:01,626 --> 00:52:05,824
Well, you could be
if you reached out.

592
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:11,058
Anyway, l just had a silly idea
they wouldn´t like it your way.

593
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,798
-Maybe you´re right.
-No.

594
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,071
Let´s not keep talking
about the show.

595
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:24,978
Don´t you ever think
of anything else?

596
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:31,721
Look at that moon.
lt´s like a million-dollar gold piece.

597
00:52:32,757 --> 00:52:38,718
Maybe l´m trying to make
the show too low-down.

598
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:43,024
What wonderful air.
lt´s like wine.

599
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:47,997
You know, audiences´ tastes
might have changed.

600
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:50,107
Oh, Danny.

601
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,311
Excuse me, sir.

602
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:08,623
Eddie?

603
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:11,761
Yeah.

604
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:18,092
l don´t know what it is,
but he just doesn´t like me.

605
00:53:19,003 --> 00:53:21,301
No, l guess not.

606
00:53:22,507 --> 00:53:27,240
Well, l guess l´ll go in,
and let you figure it out.

607
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:34,149
Aren´t you going to say good night?

608
00:53:39,157 --> 00:53:40,749
Good night.

609
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:43,293
Good night.

610
00:53:43,962 --> 00:53:45,657
Come here, you.

611
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:18,586
Well, what do you think, Danny?

612
00:59:18,996 --> 00:59:22,523
Oh, l don´t know. We didn´t even get
enough applause to take bows.

613
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,725
A few walked out
during the first act.

614
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:27,700
You can´t tell. They might be
people with appointments.

615
00:59:27,872 --> 00:59:31,603
-Like doctors or something.
-Thanks, Eddie.

616
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:36,008
-My dear, magnificent, magnificent!
-Sheer poetry, poetry of movement.

617
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,807
Oh, every scene a painting.

618
00:59:37,982 --> 00:59:43,318
My dear. l am Mrs. Fenimore Hume,
president of the Pure Art Forum.

619
00:59:43,488 --> 00:59:46,548
l wonder if you would come to
a little gathering at my house?

620
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:50,319
-A sort of a late supper.
-l´d be delighted.

621
00:59:50,495 --> 00:59:54,761
-Danny, do you mind if l go?
-No, go ahead. Sounds like fun.

622
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:56,194
l´ll only be a minute.

623
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:02,332
Brother, if those longhairs go for it,
you´re dead.

624
01:00:07,078 --> 01:00:11,742
-Hello, Mr. Manion. Have a good seat?
-Yeah. l saw and heard everything.

625
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:14,783
This was just a tryout, Mr. Manion.
Don´t judge by this.

626
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:17,147
Remember, our understanding
was New York.

627
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:20,722
-That´s right. Nobody´s rushing you.
-Thanks very much.

628
01:00:20,892 --> 01:00:25,261
They´re tearing it to shreds in the
lobby. What´ll we do? Post a notice?

629
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:27,954
No, no. l just want
a little time to think.

630
01:00:28,132 --> 01:00:31,101
Have everybody on-stage
tomorrow morning at 1 0:00.

631
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:33,064
l´m going for a walk.

632
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:35,999
Can l drive you anyplace, Danny?

633
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,708
No, thanks. Not tonight.

634
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:44,606
And that guy never looked at a dame
before in his life.

635
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:47,616
-Good morning.
-Morning.

636
01:00:48,419 --> 01:00:50,080
-Good morning, everyone.
-Morning.

637
01:00:50,254 --> 01:00:52,313
-Morning.
-Morning, Miss Pendleton.

638
01:00:53,925 --> 01:00:56,189
Good morning, everybody.

639
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:00,993
What´s wrong with you all?
Why is everybody so glum?

640
01:01:01,165 --> 01:01:03,827
-Haven´t you read the notices?
-No.

641
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,732
Why, she hasn´t read the notices.

642
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:12,973
´´<i>Swinging the Muses</i>, although lovely
in spots, resembles a Bach festival.

643
01:01:13,144 --> 01:01:17,171
lt should´ve been at Symphony Hall,
where the audience is forewarned...

644
01:01:17,348 --> 01:01:20,044
...so that they can sleep
through the performance.´´

645
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,651
And listen to this:

646
01:01:22,086 --> 01:01:25,749
´´As for myself, l can take
about 20 minutes of Greek classic.

647
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:28,790
But two hours would
get anybody down.´´

648
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:32,854
How dare they?

649
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,521
What do they know of the arts?

650
01:01:36,534 --> 01:01:38,593
l see it as a great triumph.

651
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:41,101
We´ve given something beautiful
to the theater.

652
01:01:41,272 --> 01:01:43,069
Yeah, our blood.

653
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,510
But there´s a line at the box office
down the street.

654
01:01:47,144 --> 01:01:51,478
They´re the ones who bought advance
tickets, asking for their money back.

655
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:55,176
We had a great show until you
butted in and made it so highbrow.

656
01:01:55,553 --> 01:01:57,077
Highbrow?

657
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:04,595
l was warned about your country.

658
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:09,761
How can you mix art with jive
and baseball and hot dogs?

659
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:13,631
Get her. The show busts,
so she don´t live here anymore.

660
01:02:13,804 --> 01:02:17,740
Hold it. Hold it, everybody.
This´ll get us no place.

661
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,570
Look, kids. When l got all of you
into this thing...

662
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:22,508
...l was sure we´d have a smash.

663
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,478
l knew what l wanted then,
and l know what l want now.

664
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,778
We´re going back to what it was,
before l got sidetracked.

665
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,586
We´re gonna throw
all the phony art overboard.

666
01:02:31,756 --> 01:02:34,190
Stay out of town rehearsing
till it´s in shape.

667
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:36,292
lt´ll be everything it started out as:

668
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,157
A show for people who like
jive and baseball and hot dogs.

669
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,325
Now, one more thing.

670
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,870
From now on, there´ll be nobody
around here acting like a goddess.

671
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,803
l´m the boss, what l say goes.

672
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:54,069
lf anybody doesn´t like it that way,
now´s the time to say so.

673
01:02:57,014 --> 01:02:58,379
Well?

674
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:03,044
Mr. Miller, the show is all yours.

675
01:03:04,622 --> 01:03:05,953
All right, that´s that.

676
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:09,820
Before l look anyplace else, l´ll try
every one of you kids for the lead.

677
01:03:12,763 --> 01:03:14,390
Hello, Kitty.

678
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,359
Oh, Mr. Jordan.
You´re just the one l want to see.

679
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:20,163
-So l imagined.
-l want to go back, right away.

680
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,136
Surely you don´t want to leave
when he needs you most.

681
01:03:23,307 --> 01:03:25,207
l do. l want to leave at once.

682
01:03:25,376 --> 01:03:29,142
You told me you wanted to help him,
my sole reason for letting you come.

683
01:03:29,313 --> 01:03:33,181
l lied to you, Mr. Jordan. l wasn´t
interested in him, not for a second.

684
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,754
l came for purely selfish reasons, to
change the show. That´s all l wanted.

685
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:40,755
-l know.
-And still you let me go ahead?

686
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:44,952
-l had a feeling it´d work out all right.
-But it hasn´t.

687
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:46,824
lt´s worked out all wrong.

688
01:03:47,164 --> 01:03:49,826
l don´t intend to tolerate
his arrogance anymore.

689
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,230
l don´t think you´ll go back.
Not right now.

690
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:57,004
Mr. Jordan, you underestimate
my emotions.

691
01:03:57,241 --> 01:03:59,607
l told you l hate the man.

692
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:03,671
-l loathe him.
-l´m not sure of that, either.

693
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,984
-You´re not in possession of the facts.
-What facts?

694
01:04:08,352 --> 01:04:11,185
Well, l´d like to take you
back in time a few months.

695
01:04:11,355 --> 01:04:14,119
Something important happened
then that you should know.

696
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:17,089
-What happened?
-You´ll see.

697
01:04:27,972 --> 01:04:30,839
He´s on every number
but the right one. Thirteen wins.

698
01:04:31,008 --> 01:04:34,273
-Why don´t you tell him?
-This is a while ago. l wasn´t here.

699
01:04:34,712 --> 01:04:37,442
-l´ll tell him, then.
-He can´t see or hear you.

700
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:39,845
Besides, you haven´t met him yet.

701
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:48,424
-Thirteen.
-Just as you predicted.

702
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:52,028
l´m not the only one who knew.
The wheel is crooked.

703
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,201
What is it?
What´s the matter?

704
01:05:02,373 --> 01:05:06,207
They thought Danny was with regular
patrons. They extended him credit.

705
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:08,675
He´s lost $20,000 and can´t pay.

706
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:15,941
Well, l don´t understand what
any of this has to do with me.

707
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,816
Come along. You´ll see.

708
01:05:36,006 --> 01:05:39,806
-Like to hear what they´re saying?
-Yes, l would.

709
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:42,002
Why did you keep playing
with no money?

710
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:45,945
-l thought l might win.
-Well, you didn´t.

711
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:49,847
-l´d like to talk to you alone.
-Spike, get going.

712
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,387
We´re supposed to be partners.
l have half-interest in this palace.

713
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:55,491
l said, get going.

714
01:05:57,962 --> 01:06:01,591
Okay, let´s have it.

715
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:03,255
Well, it´s pretty simple.

716
01:06:07,605 --> 01:06:11,302
l´m Daniel Miller. l had to get
hold of $ 1 00,000 right away.

717
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:13,534
-What for?
-To put on a show.

718
01:06:13,711 --> 01:06:17,169
l´ve had a couple failures and the boys
with the money ran out on me.

719
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,681
But l still have plenty of confidence
in the show and in myself.

720
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:22,842
-lf you can--
-That´s very touching.

721
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,355
But unless l have my 20,000
by tomorrow morning....

722
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,960
You´ll have one of your gorillas
bump me off.

723
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:34,029
-You´ve been seeing too many movies.
-Oh, l think l know how you operate.

724
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:36,496
l figured all that out
before l came up here.

725
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:37,929
Oh, you did?

726
01:06:38,102 --> 01:06:40,297
And l also figured out,
if l didn´t win...

727
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:43,907
...you´d put up the 1 00,000
for a piece of the show.

728
01:06:44,074 --> 01:06:46,599
Now, where did you ever
get an idea like that?

729
01:06:46,777 --> 01:06:50,474
Because you´re a gambler. You lose
1 00,000 on the turn of a card.

730
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:53,116
Turning cards is my business.

731
01:06:53,284 --> 01:06:55,548
Goodbye, Mr. Miller.

732
01:06:59,623 --> 01:07:01,853
Go out that door.

733
01:07:07,431 --> 01:07:11,094
Of course, Mr. Manion, if anything
should happen to me now...

734
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:14,726
...with all those witnesses,
you´d be a cinch for the electric chair.

735
01:07:15,105 --> 01:07:16,663
Go on.

736
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,469
On the other hand, you back the show
and l´ll guarantee it with a note.

737
01:07:20,644 --> 01:07:23,272
You haven´t any money.
What good is your note?

738
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:26,848
Oh, this one´s very good.
lt´s a suicide note.

739
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,785
-A suicide note.
-That´s right.

740
01:07:32,957 --> 01:07:36,620
lf the show fails, you can have
one of your boys take care of me...

741
01:07:36,794 --> 01:07:40,161
...plant the note on my body,
you´re in the clear with the police.

742
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:43,198
Doesn´t that appeal
to your gambler´s instinct?

743
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:47,770
So you want to stake your life
against my money? ls that it?

744
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,906
That´s the idea.

745
01:07:50,074 --> 01:07:52,872
At least you know l´ll work hard
to put the show over.

746
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:00,044
All right.

747
01:08:00,217 --> 01:08:02,879
l´ll play with those chips.

748
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:04,782
Sit down.

749
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:09,621
And...

750
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:11,852
...start writing.

751
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:17,500
´´No one is responsible...

752
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:22,838
...for my death but myself.

753
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:26,909
l´ve taken my own life...

754
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:28,942
...because....´´

755
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:37,611
That´s the reason l´ve concerned
myself with this young man.

756
01:08:37,788 --> 01:08:42,088
l´ve always felt that he had a great
deal to offer to life and the theater.

757
01:08:42,259 --> 01:08:45,456
-lt´d be a pity to take him too soon.
-Yes.

758
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:49,861
The choice is up to you. With you
in the New York opening, it can´t fail.

759
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:53,162
But what´ll l do?
Will he take me back now?

760
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:56,033
l´m quite sure it´s worth trying.

761
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:03,442
Good luck, my dear.
And do it his way this time.

762
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,815
l am the daughter of Zeus.

763
01:09:08,986 --> 01:09:12,183
l´m sorry, honey.
lt´s just too much for you.

764
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:15,291
-Anyone else, Eddie?
-Yes.

765
01:09:15,993 --> 01:09:19,520
-One more.
-What do you want?

766
01:09:20,164 --> 01:09:22,098
l want to come back.

767
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:24,063
You´re too late.

768
01:09:25,602 --> 01:09:28,571
Oh, Danny, wait, please. Danny.

769
01:09:28,739 --> 01:09:32,072
-You walked out. You can stay out.
-You haven´t found anyone else.

770
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:34,176
-You need me.
-Like a hole in the head.

771
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:37,541
-You´ve got to listen to me.
-What are you following me for?

772
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,411
What are you after now?
Are you still in love with me?

773
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:44,452
l didn´t realize what any of this
meant to you. But now l do.

774
01:09:44,621 --> 01:09:46,612
And all l wanna do is help.

775
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,521
l´ll do anything, anything you say.

776
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:54,459
lt´s unimportant what you think of me.

777
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,227
Do it for yourself, for the show.

778
01:10:03,474 --> 01:10:05,567
Please, Danny.

779
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:10,013
-You say you´ll do anything l say?
-Yes, Danny.

780
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,341
-You´ll sing my way?
-Yes, Danny.

781
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:14,040
-Dance my way?
-Yes, Danny.

782
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:17,619
-Wear anything l want you to wear?
-Yes, Danny.

783
01:10:18,188 --> 01:10:19,780
All right.

784
01:10:20,624 --> 01:10:22,455
You open in New York Thursday night.

785
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:30,857
lt received bad notices
in Philadelphia.

786
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:34,299
Jack, l understand they changed it.
l heard good reports.

787
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:38,435
lt was rumored some sort of trouble
with the leading lady.

788
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,271
l adore musicals.
l´m so tired of thinking.

789
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:45,882
Darling, you´ve lost weight,
haven´t you? Or is that a new dress?

790
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,719
-Good luck, Mr. Miller.
-Best of luck.

791
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:51,878
-Hope you have a smash.
-Thanks, girls.

792
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:55,422
Thanks for staying with it.
l love all of you.

793
01:10:57,261 --> 01:10:59,786
Honey, see you a minute?
lt´s Danny.

794
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,129
Hello, Danny.

795
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,892
l hope it´s wonderful.

796
01:11:05,068 --> 01:11:08,868
Well, if you come through, we´ll have
them tossing their wives in the air.

797
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,638
-l´ll do my very best, Danny.
-l know you will.

798
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,369
-Curtain! Curtain!
-Okay.

799
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:16,035
Luck again, honey.

800
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:21,042
-Good luck, Danny.
-You too.

801
01:11:21,218 --> 01:11:22,515
Gee, l´m scared stiff.

802
01:11:22,686 --> 01:11:26,747
l had butterflies in my stomach before,
but now they´re wearing roller skates.

803
01:11:26,924 --> 01:11:31,054
-Don´t bother her, Max. She´s on soon.
-Yeah, yeah, l know. l know.

804
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,722
-Who is it?
-lt´s Max, honey.

805
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:36,729
Come in.

806
01:11:39,269 --> 01:11:42,238
This is Mr. Kelly. He´s a detective.

807
01:11:44,141 --> 01:11:45,506
A detective?

808
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,338
You owe $ 1 800
to the Waldorf Plaza Hotel, lady.

809
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,104
You had an expensive suite.

810
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,943
You skipped to Philadelphia
and we haven´t seen a dime.

811
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:55,948
Well, l--

812
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:58,747
Tell him about your rich uncle
with all the cows.

813
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:02,187
Don´t give me those cows, lady.
None of your stories check.

814
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:06,227
The switchboard says you got no call.
The desk says you got no letters.

815
01:12:06,396 --> 01:12:09,058
You´ve got no boyfriends
and you´ve got no relatives.

816
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:11,098
There´s something phony about you.

817
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:13,793
Come on, now. Who are you?
Where did you come from?

818
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:17,065
-l´m going on in a few minutes.
-You have a lot to explain...

819
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:20,472
...or you´ll be going to jail
in a few minutes. Out with it.

820
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:27,448
Well, a gentleman friend told me
to take the Peach Bloom Suite.

821
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:30,212
He said everything
would be taken care of.

822
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,252
Who? What´s his name?

823
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:36,490
Well, he has no name.

824
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,595
He´s a messenger.
Number 701 3.

825
01:12:39,763 --> 01:12:42,493
Yeah? What kind of messenger?
Western Union?

826
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:46,124
He´s gotta know the truth.
You gotta tell us both who you are...

827
01:12:46,303 --> 01:12:48,965
...or he won´t let you
go on with the show.

828
01:12:50,974 --> 01:12:53,101
All right. All right.

829
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,709
l don´t know how to
make you believe it, but--

830
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,374
l´m Terpsichore, the Grecian goddess
and l came down from Mt. Parnassus--

831
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:04,679
On opening nights people get excited
and say crazy things.

832
01:13:04,855 --> 01:13:07,722
But l´m not saying
crazy things, Max. lt´s all true.

833
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:10,860
How could l come out of no place
and pick you for my agent?

834
01:13:11,028 --> 01:13:14,623
How could l sing and dance like l do,
and nobody ever heard of me?

835
01:13:14,798 --> 01:13:17,562
l´m just like your father.
Get ahold of yourself.

836
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:19,998
You talk to people
when nobody is around.

837
01:13:20,304 --> 01:13:23,432
Of course, l understand,
but some people don´t.

838
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:27,475
-l´m one of them. Okay, let´s go.
-Let me alone. l have to go on.

839
01:13:27,644 --> 01:13:30,112
Having trouble, Kitty?

840
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,840
l certainly am.
Thank goodness you´re here.

841
01:13:33,016 --> 01:13:36,417
-ls there somebody with us?
-Yes. Everything will be taken care of.

842
01:13:36,586 --> 01:13:40,420
-What will l tell them, Mr. Jordan?
-Mr. Jordan is here? You know him?

843
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,252
-Of course.
-Holy jumping--

844
01:13:43,427 --> 01:13:46,362
That explains how these
goofy things have been happening.

845
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:50,296
Mr. Jordan is here again.
Hello, Mr. Jordan.

846
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,401
How are you?

847
01:13:53,737 --> 01:13:57,833
-She can see him, but l can´t.
-Oh, l see. That explains everything.

848
01:13:58,008 --> 01:14:00,499
Sure it does. lf she´s a
friend of Jordan´s...

849
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:04,636
...then she´s a goddess or whatever
she says she is. lsn´t that right?

850
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:08,478
-Hey, what´s going on around here?
-You don´t know who Mr. Jordan is.

851
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,849
He was a friend of Joe´s,
that fighter l handled, Joe Pendleton.

852
01:14:12,089 --> 01:14:14,785
When Joe died, Mr. Jordan
brought him down to Earth...

853
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:17,756
...and put him inside
other people´s bodies.

854
01:14:17,928 --> 01:14:20,795
l heard from Joe last week,
Mr. Jordan.

855
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:23,592
He´s in Sacramento.

856
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:25,860
He´s using Murdock´s body.

857
01:14:26,036 --> 01:14:30,234
He´s got a couple of kids.
He´s doing fine.

858
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:33,103
-Doing fine? You said he died.
-He did.

859
01:14:33,276 --> 01:14:37,770
He was killed in an airplane crash,
and then he was cremated.

860
01:14:37,948 --> 01:14:41,281
The two of you are nuttier than
a fruitcake. What are you pulling?

861
01:14:41,451 --> 01:14:43,385
You´re coming with me,
and you are too.

862
01:14:43,553 --> 01:14:46,420
Ask Mr. Kelly if he´ll accept
payment for the hotel bill.

863
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:49,058
Mr. Jordan wants to know
if you´ll accept money.

864
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:53,754
Oh, he does, huh? lt´s 1 800 bucks.
Has Mr. Jordan got it in his pocket?

865
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,831
-Or maybe he ain´t got pockets.
-l only got 90 bucks.

866
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,900
Tell Max to answer the telephone.

867
01:14:59,069 --> 01:15:03,028
-Mr. Jordan says to answer the phone.
-The phone? lt ain´t ringing.

868
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:14,949
Hello?

869
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:18,178
Yeah, this is Corkle.
Oh, hello, Sam.

870
01:15:18,355 --> 01:15:21,916
lt´s Sam Hooper, the bookie.
How´d he know l was here?

871
01:15:22,092 --> 01:15:24,993
What, Sam?
Pacific Handicap?

872
01:15:25,162 --> 01:15:27,096
No, l didn´t call you.

873
01:15:27,264 --> 01:15:31,064
No, no, l don´t wanna
place a bet, Sam.

874
01:15:33,537 --> 01:15:34,799
Wait a minute.

875
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:37,235
Tell him to bet his $90
on Chickie´s Choice.

876
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:40,240
Mr. Jordan says to bet your $90
on Chickie´s Choice.

877
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,605
Hold it. Chickie´s Choice?

878
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:45,748
Oh, look, Mr. Jordan, please.

879
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,851
Look, Chickie´s Choice
is a rank outsider.

880
01:15:49,019 --> 01:15:51,749
Look, a 20-to-1 shot.

881
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,982
-Look, a dog.
-Go on, do as he says.

882
01:15:55,158 --> 01:15:57,991
All right. Hello, Sam?

883
01:15:58,161 --> 01:16:02,120
Ninety bucks on the nose,
Chickie´s Choice. Yeah.

884
01:16:02,299 --> 01:16:06,565
Wanna place a bet? The race´ll be
on in a few minutes, California time.

885
01:16:06,736 --> 01:16:10,866
l´m not taking tips from a guy
that ain´t even here.

886
01:16:11,908 --> 01:16:17,039
That´s it, Sam. My last 90 bucks,
Chickie´s Choice.

887
01:16:17,214 --> 01:16:18,806
Yeah.

888
01:16:20,517 --> 01:16:24,476
lf we win, there´s your 1 800 bucks.

889
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:29,955
That´s right, Mr. Jordan.

890
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:34,723
-Exactly 1 800 bucks.
-Kitty, turn on the radio.

891
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,458
<i>There they go.</i>
<i>Donny Dear to the front.</i>

892
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,730
<i>Jackter is second. Count Saffron</i>
<i>is third. Glory Girl, fourth.</i>

893
01:16:42,906 --> 01:16:46,171
<i>Montague II is fifth. Pancho, sixth.</i>
<i>And Waterboy on the outside.</i>

894
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:49,312
Where´s Chickie´s Choice?

895
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:52,209
<i>Waterboy on the outside</i>
<i>is second by a head.</i>

896
01:16:52,382 --> 01:16:56,546
Don´t you think you ought to have me
put it on Donny Dear?

897
01:16:58,522 --> 01:17:01,320
<i>Into the back stretch.</i>
<i>It´s Donny Dear in the lead.</i>

898
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:05,655
<i>Count Saffron is second by</i>
<i>one length. Waterboy is third.</i>

899
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:10,696
Mr. Jordan, are you sure
Chickie´s Choice is in the race?

900
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:14,928
-<i>And Chickie´s Choice is moving up.</i>
-He said Chickie´s Choice!

901
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:17,096
<i>It´s Donny Dear in front by one length.</i>

902
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:21,005
<i>Count Saffron is second. And now</i>
<i>Chickie´s Choice is moving up.</i>

903
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:25,444
Fourth! Come on, sweetheart.

904
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:30,075
<i>Waterboy is third by three-quarters</i>
<i>of a length. Chickie´s Choice is fourth.</i>

905
01:17:30,253 --> 01:17:34,553
<i>Into the stretch is Donny Dear in front</i>
<i>and Chickie´s Choice coming up fast.</i>

906
01:17:34,724 --> 01:17:38,091
<i>Chickie´s Choice challenging</i>
<i>Donny Dear, Donny Dear in front.</i>

907
01:17:38,261 --> 01:17:40,024
<i>Chickie´s Choice is second.</i>

908
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:44,395
-Come on, come on, please.
-Come on, you dog!

909
01:17:44,568 --> 01:17:47,366
<i>And Donny Dear wins by a nose!</i>

910
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,702
l should have known.

911
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,969
Mr. Jordan, how could you
do this thing to me?

912
01:17:55,145 --> 01:17:58,410
<i>No, no, wait. Sorry. My mistake.</i>
<i>It´s the other way around.</i>

913
01:17:58,582 --> 01:18:01,380
<i>The winner is Chickie´s Choice.</i>

914
01:18:02,652 --> 01:18:08,113
Mr. Jordan, would you like to go to
the races with me Saturday afternoon?

915
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:51,519
How do you like me, Kelly?
l get 1 0 percent of a goddess.

916
01:20:00,904 --> 01:20:03,372
Mr. Manion, this can´t wait.

917
01:26:13,776 --> 01:26:17,007
Well, kids, it looks like
we´re in the money.

918
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:22,817
lf you don´t believe it, listen:
The Scott-Harringtons--

919
01:26:22,985 --> 01:26:26,182
They´re Park Avenue, and big,
are throwing a big party.

920
01:26:26,355 --> 01:26:31,258
Look your prettiest, the address is on
the callboard and l´ll see you there.

921
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:35,730
You´re going with me.
l wanna show you off.

922
01:26:35,898 --> 01:26:38,162
This is the happiest night.
You killed them.

923
01:26:38,334 --> 01:26:42,270
-l´m glad, Danny. l´m happy for you.
-Didn´t hurt too much, did it?

924
01:26:42,438 --> 01:26:46,169
-l had a wonderful time.
-Kitty, l want to tell you that--

925
01:26:46,542 --> 01:26:48,510
Come here with me.

926
01:26:53,683 --> 01:26:56,345
Kitty, darling, l wanna tell you that--

927
01:27:00,957 --> 01:27:02,948
That´s what l was trying to say.

928
01:27:03,126 --> 01:27:05,890
l wanted to hold you
every time l´ve been near you.

929
01:27:06,062 --> 01:27:08,087
Even when you slapped me
in the face.

930
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:11,332
l promise l´ll never do it again.

931
01:27:21,644 --> 01:27:24,477
l´m sorry, Kitty,
l have bad news for you.

932
01:27:24,647 --> 01:27:26,274
l´m afraid you have to go back.

933
01:27:28,484 --> 01:27:30,475
l´ll be waiting for you.

934
01:27:30,653 --> 01:27:32,348
What is it?

935
01:27:32,922 --> 01:27:34,184
What´s the matter?

936
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,918
Oh, nothing, Danny.

937
01:27:38,327 --> 01:27:40,158
Nothing.

938
01:27:42,498 --> 01:27:45,194
Why are you staring at me like that?

939
01:27:47,503 --> 01:27:50,131
Danny, if anything should happen....

940
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:55,970
-lf we should lose each other....
-Lose each other?

941
01:27:57,713 --> 01:28:01,240
No matter how hard it is
for you to understand...

942
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:04,011
...please believe one thing:

943
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,715
l love you now...

944
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,551
...and l´ll love you always.

945
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:14,518
Kitty, darling, what is it
you´re trying to tell me?

946
01:28:17,033 --> 01:28:19,968
l can´t explain to you, Danny.

947
01:28:20,136 --> 01:28:22,001
-l have to leave you now.
-Leave me?

948
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:24,162
Yes, there´s something--

949
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,831
-Someone l--
-Kitty, what is it?

950
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:30,979
Please trust me.

951
01:28:31,147 --> 01:28:33,240
And wait for me.

952
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:36,347
l´ll be back...

953
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:38,384
...if l can.

954
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:43,591
lf l can at all, l´ll be at the party.

955
01:28:50,466 --> 01:28:53,526
Sweetheart, you were the tops.
And, oh, what an idea l got.

956
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,729
Get those other eight dames
down here. l´ll book you a tour.

957
01:28:56,906 --> 01:28:59,602
-´´The Nine Original Muses.´´
-Take me out of here, Max.

958
01:28:59,775 --> 01:29:02,175
Ain´t you going to the party, honey?

959
01:29:02,345 --> 01:29:04,279
Please, Max.

960
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,118
-Anything wrong with you and Danny?
-Please, just let me think.

961
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:17,316
Sure.

962
01:29:17,927 --> 01:29:20,487
You did the only thing
you could do, Kitty.

963
01:29:20,663 --> 01:29:24,360
No. l shouldn´t have done it.
l never should have left him.

964
01:29:24,533 --> 01:29:28,799
-Well, let´s tell the driver to turn back.
-What am l going to do?

965
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:32,737
-What am l going to do?
-l don´t know. We can´t go both ways.

966
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:37,073
-l´m sorry, Kitty. We´re leaving tonight.
-Tonight?

967
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,544
l don´t understand.
You brought me here, and--

968
01:29:39,715 --> 01:29:41,979
No, no, no, honey.
You brought me, remember?

969
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:45,746
Not you, Max. l can´t go.

970
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:48,891
Not now. Nothing is settled.
And Manion.

971
01:29:49,058 --> 01:29:51,788
What will he do if l step out
of the show?

972
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:54,327
Manion?
What are you talking about?

973
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:57,557
l told you, Max, l´m not talking to you.

974
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:04,000
You mean--?
You mean, Mr. Jordan is here?

975
01:30:04,173 --> 01:30:07,404
Yes, he´s sitting right next to you.

976
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:11,273
Hello, Mr. Jordan.
l´m pleased to see you again.

977
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,210
Thank you, Max.

978
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:18,780
Tell the driver to go to Pier 7,
East River. We haven´t much time.

979
01:30:19,055 --> 01:30:22,547
-Pier 7, East River.
-East River?

980
01:30:22,725 --> 01:30:25,694
-What are we going there for?
-Mr. Jordan´s orders.

981
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:29,698
l see. l´m sorry, Mr. Jordan.

982
01:30:29,865 --> 01:30:32,129
l didn´t mean to butt in.

983
01:30:47,283 --> 01:30:49,751
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

984
01:30:51,253 --> 01:30:53,084
Tell Max to go for the police.

985
01:30:53,255 --> 01:30:56,281
Mr. Jordan says you´re to go
for the police, immediately.

986
01:30:56,459 --> 01:30:58,051
Please, Max, hurry.

987
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,590
Look.

988
01:31:13,075 --> 01:31:15,202
Well, here he comes now.

989
01:31:32,995 --> 01:31:35,759
-Manion!
-Yes.

990
01:31:35,931 --> 01:31:39,799
-But who? Why?
-lt was Spike, his partner.

991
01:31:39,969 --> 01:31:44,167
Sole owner of the gambling casino
now, at least till the police catch him.

992
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,399
-How dreadful.
-Perhaps.

993
01:31:46,575 --> 01:31:50,511
But if the show had failed, he would´ve
murdered Danny Miller one hour ago.

994
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:55,116
So you see, Kitty, that´s why it was
necessary for you to stay until now.

995
01:31:55,284 --> 01:31:57,514
lt isn´t necessary any longer.

996
01:31:57,686 --> 01:32:01,349
But it is. lt is because....

997
01:32:02,024 --> 01:32:05,790
-Because it´s different now.
-You saved Danny´s life.

998
01:32:05,961 --> 01:32:10,159
-That is all we had for you to do.
-l don´t care. l don´t care.

999
01:32:10,332 --> 01:32:13,460
l love him and l want to stay.

1000
01:32:13,836 --> 01:32:15,827
lt wasn´t meant to be, Kitty.

1001
01:32:16,005 --> 01:32:19,168
Your mission is accomplished
and now you must return.

1002
01:32:19,341 --> 01:32:20,933
That´s what we agreed upon.

1003
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:24,436
But l don´t want it that way anymore.

1004
01:32:24,613 --> 01:32:27,673
Please, Mr. Jordan. Please.

1005
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:31,217
l don´t wanna be a goddess.
l just wanna be a human being.

1006
01:32:31,387 --> 01:32:37,155
l want to get married and have
a home and be with Danny, always.

1007
01:32:38,194 --> 01:32:39,889
Listen.

1008
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:44,493
-We must go now, my dear.
-No.

1009
01:32:45,034 --> 01:32:47,798
l´m not going. l´m not going!

1010
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,300
Don´t fight it, Terpsichore.

1011
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:52,699
No! No!

1012
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:55,275
l´m Kitty Pendleton!

1013
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:58,345
You can´t make me!
l´m going back to Danny!

1014
01:32:58,514 --> 01:33:00,379
l´m going back!

1015
01:33:26,842 --> 01:33:29,970
Oh, Danny. Danny, l´ve come back.

1016
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:33,980
He tried to take me away,
but l´ve come back to you.

1017
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:42,757
Don´t be angry with me. Don´t you
understand? l´ve come back.

1018
01:33:42,925 --> 01:33:46,622
-l´m never going to leave you again.
-Champagne?

1019
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:50,663
Don´t spread this around, but this is
the first time l ever tasted champagne.

1020
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:54,860
What´s the matter with Danny?
Why doesn´t he talk to me?

1021
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:58,500
Eddie. Eddie!

1022
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,767
lt´s no use.

1023
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:03,440
They can´t see or hear you.

1024
01:34:06,982 --> 01:34:09,678
Please, Mr. Jordan.

1025
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,945
Please let him hear me.

1026
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:19,085
Please let him see me.

1027
01:34:19,261 --> 01:34:21,354
Just for one moment.

1028
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:26,194
lt has to be this way.
You can´t change destiny.

1029
01:34:29,138 --> 01:34:31,333
Mr. Jordan...

1030
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,972
...l want to cry...

1031
01:34:36,145 --> 01:34:38,909
...but l can´t.

1032
01:34:39,081 --> 01:34:41,549
There are no tears.

1033
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,652
Mr. Jordan...

1034
01:34:46,822 --> 01:34:51,088
-...at least let me cry.
-You can´t anymore.

1035
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:53,558
Tears are only for mortals.

1036
01:34:53,729 --> 01:34:56,254
lt´s an advantage they have over us.

1037
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,334
Come, Terpsichore.

1038
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:12,009
Yes, Mr. Jordan.

1039
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:22,184
Danny?

1040
01:35:22,858 --> 01:35:25,292
What´s the matter, kid?
You´ve got a smash hit...

1041
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:28,362
...and you´re moping around
like a guy that--

1042
01:35:32,201 --> 01:35:35,295
lt´s Kitty´s. She´s here.

1043
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,837
No.

1044
01:35:41,176 --> 01:35:43,406
She was here...

1045
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,742
...but she´s gone.

1046
01:35:45,914 --> 01:35:48,712
What are you talking about?
l don´t understand.

1047
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:52,045
Neither did l.

1048
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:55,384
But now l´m beginning
to understand many things.

1049
01:35:55,557 --> 01:36:00,221
-Don´t look for her. You won´t find her.
-This is her coat. She must be here.

1050
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:03,229
Tried to tell me right after the show.

1051
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:05,833
Tried to tell you what?

1052
01:36:07,603 --> 01:36:09,503
l don´t know.

1053
01:36:09,672 --> 01:36:12,766
l sometimes wonder
if she ever was real.

1054
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:17,536
l only know she came out of nowhere...

1055
01:36:18,547 --> 01:36:20,640
...and vanished the same way.

1056
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:24,610
He was invisible. How could
he tell you there would be a murder?

1057
01:36:24,787 --> 01:36:28,188
Mr. Jordan told her and she told me.

1058
01:36:28,357 --> 01:36:31,884
Kitty Pendleton was at the murder
scene and hasn´t been seen since.

1059
01:36:32,061 --> 01:36:35,758
-Where is she now?
-Mr. Jordan took her back.

1060
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:39,492
Oh, now l suppose
she´s living up in the clouds...

1061
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:42,364
...in a civilization
that never even existed.

1062
01:36:42,538 --> 01:36:45,029
That´s right. That´s just where she is.

1063
01:36:45,207 --> 01:36:48,404
Looks like we´ll have to cart
this guy off to the nut factory.

1064
01:36:48,577 --> 01:36:52,206
Wait, l´m innocent. l never
saw the girl before that first day.

1065
01:36:52,381 --> 01:36:55,578
She came in and flung her arms
around my neck and she said:

1066
01:36:55,751 --> 01:37:00,711
´´Max, just think, they took me out of
the chorus and gave me the lead.

1067
01:37:00,889 --> 01:37:06,384
l´m gonna play Terpsichore
and l want you to be my agent.´´

1068
01:37:08,163 --> 01:37:10,893
Wait. Do you expect us to believe...

1069
01:37:11,066 --> 01:37:14,092
...that a dame just bounced in
out of no place?

1070
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:19,707
Max, just think, they took me out of
the chorus and gave me the lead.

1071
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:24,608
l´m going to play Terpsichore
and l want you to be my agent.

1072
01:37:50,706 --> 01:37:52,571
l must be leaving now, Terpsichore.

1073
01:37:53,142 --> 01:37:56,873
What´s going to happen, Mr. Jordan,
now that l´ve lost him?

1074
01:37:57,045 --> 01:37:58,910
You haven´t.

1075
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:02,908
Would you like me to show you?

1076
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:09,557
l wouldn´t do this
for anyone else, Terpsichore...

1077
01:38:09,825 --> 01:38:12,055
...but l think you´ve earned it.

1078
01:38:13,195 --> 01:38:14,822
Come.

1079
01:38:17,132 --> 01:38:18,861
Where are we going?

1080
01:38:19,034 --> 01:38:21,901
Merely a few years into the future.

1081
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:32,107
You see, my dear, how simple it is?
Here we are, witnessing the future.

1082
01:38:35,217 --> 01:38:38,277
And there l am, still on the job.

1083
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:42,718
Look.

1084
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,037
Danny.

1085
01:38:57,606 --> 01:39:00,131
But he seems just about the same.

1086
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:03,335
The spirit never really ages, my dear.

1087
01:39:03,779 --> 01:39:07,875
ln all these years,
he´s never had a failure.

1088
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:10,416
There´s a legend about him
on Broadway.

1089
01:39:10,586 --> 01:39:13,146
They say he was kissed by the Muse.

1090
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:16,416
Will he look for me? Will he find me?

1091
01:39:16,592 --> 01:39:19,857
-Will he remember me?
-Well, let´s wait and see.

1092
01:39:20,028 --> 01:39:22,155
Miller, Daniel.

1093
01:39:40,382 --> 01:39:41,906
Why--

1094
01:39:42,084 --> 01:39:44,780
-Why, it´s--
-Yes.

1095
01:40:19,187 --> 01:40:21,815
Thank you, Mr. Jordan.
