1
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,692
Sir loan from AlG Federal Government
gets it on 79.9 percent stake.

2
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,427
l'll take that.

3
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,062
Hello.
Ya. Will do.

4
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,907
AG corporation at 1 1 .8

5
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,498
Okay, sure.

6
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,407
l will call you back.

7
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,603
Akash.

8
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,839
Akash.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,973
There was a call from the bank.
Our loan has been sanctioned.

10
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,780
Yes, we're buying Ellen
Steel company. - What?

11
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,613
Why?

12
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,658
lt's a small loan, for
around 1-1 .5 million dollars.

13
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,426
Ellen Steel is a dead company.

14
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,061
We'll make our clients
invest their money in it.

15
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,399
Which will increase
its stock value?

16
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,533
And if the stock value increases..

17
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,767
..so will the profit.
- No, no, that's not ourjob.

18
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,934
Taking loans is not
what we do.. Akash?

19
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,408
Chill Dude

20
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,420
Sir, can you spare me some change.

21
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,801
''ls the season to be jolly..''

22
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,613
'l am not responsible
for this crash Mr. Lee'

23
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,588
'Sir, please don't
raise your voice on me.'

24
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,588
'What happened when you
made 150% profit last year? '

25
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,828
'Fine, l don't need
you to do business.'

26
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,092
'l will survive this.'

27
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,131
'Akash.'

28
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,433
'The market has crashed.'

29
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,606
'lts over man. it
just moved too fast.'

30
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,810
'There was a call from the bank.'

31
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,649
'Yeah, we'll payback their loan.'

32
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,479
'They aren't going
to lose their money.'

33
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,620
'Why did you do this? '

34
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,696
'Listen, all of you knew
that l was taking a loan.'

35
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,194
'That's a Lie.'

36
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,794
'You took our
signatures for the loan..

37
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,699
..telling us that it was
for 1 million dollars.'

38
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,703
'And went ahead and took
a loan of 12 million.'

39
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,715
'What, 12 million? '

40
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,577
'Yes.. if that company
had done well

41
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,619
'l wasn't going to be the
only one to profit from it'

42
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,649
'We're all equal partners.'

43
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,126
'Would you guys have agreed..

44
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,718
..if l had said it was
a loan of 12 million? '

45
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,929
'All of you.. '

46
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,599
'All of you think small.'

47
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,964
You think, it was easy
to make this big office?

48
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,197
'l didn't know the
market would crash.'

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,569
So, you cheated us.

50
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,637
'You were in a hurry to
make it big, isn't it? '

51
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,674
'You wanted to win every race.'

52
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,510
We don't want to come first.

53
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,852
Our dreams aren't as big as yours

54
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,791
'What do you'll want to do? '

55
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:58,922
'Shut down the company.'

56
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,000
'Sell the office!
- Akash, please.'

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,158
'Try to understand.
- not there'

58
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,667
'All of you were losers.'

59
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,635
'All of you were losers!
- Akash, please'

60
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,536
'Go on.. let me see what
you'll are capable of without me.'

61
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,732
'Where will we go? '

62
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,934
'How will we repay the loan? '

63
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,511
Tell me how will we pay it back?
- Gaurav.

64
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,944
Where will we go and how will
we repay it? - Gaurav, please.

65
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,575
How will we repay
the loan now, tell me

66
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,877
How?

67
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,282
What will we do without you?

68
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,562
Your mom and dad live
without you as well.

69
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,594
You could neither be a
good son, nor a good friend.

70
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,164
What did you earn?

71
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,832
Money.

72
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,174
Now you don't even have that.

73
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,704
Forget it.

74
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,275
Forget it.

75
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,742
We're losers.

76
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,244
Yes.

77
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:59,856
But today.. you're the loser.

78
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,081
And the suicide
rate has risen to 27..

79
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,347
A 48year old man committed
suicide today..

80
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,122
..by jumping off his
office building.

81
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,920
lt seems he was everything.

82
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,290
l am not responsible for this crash.

83
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,058
Market, there's crash.

84
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,360
How did l know that
the market would crash?

85
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,224
Die.

86
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,102
Should l push you?

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,808
What else?

88
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,706
You've been standing
there for so long.

89
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,946
Actually no. Because
that will amount to murder.

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,744
No, no, l don't think so.

91
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,152
Please continue, jump jump

92
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,233
You know.. when you want
to do something like this..

93
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,826
..you shouldn't think.

94
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,337
Just do it.

95
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,039
Are you a suicide consultant?

96
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,238
lts common sense, man.

97
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,864
When l am slightly drunk..
l talk a lot.

98
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,332
Jabberjabberjabberjabber

99
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,170
Actually, in real
life l am very quiet.

100
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,069
Like really quiet.

101
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,371
But wait.. this is real life.

102
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,045
Sorry. l am sorry.

103
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,677
Concentrate.

104
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,150
Quiet.

105
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,885
Continue, jump jump

106
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,704
You know.. when l was really young.

107
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,337
Really young.

108
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,871
l never liked drinking medicine.

109
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,111
My mother would say to
me ''Close your eyes..''

110
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,047
''..count to three and drink it''.

111
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,281
Just..

112
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,919
So try that.

113
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,967
Okay, so l am also done.

114
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,905
Boy.

115
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,917
One.

116
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,825
Two.

117
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,058
Three.

118
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,068
Get off the bridge now!

119
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,202
Oh no! Coast guard.

120
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,001
Oh no.

121
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,508
God!

122
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,940
Alright, break it up you two, get
off the bridge, the party is over.

123
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,275
Get off the bridge now. Come on.

124
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,430
'l'll elope with you on this.'

125
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,869
'l am at the Hilton
and the room number.. '

126
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,531
'Last night l did the same thing..'

127
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,224
l found out about your accident.

128
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,134
l've come alone

129
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,901
No one else was ready to see you.

130
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,136
Then why are you here?

131
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,502
The loan you..

132
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,951
The loan we took, has been
sorted out with the bank

133
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,613
We are dissolving
the company's assets.

134
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,427
We've also found a
buyer for the office.

135
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:16,261
And we'll repay the rest by
selling our personal belongings.

136
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,405
The bank has
summoned us on the 30th.

137
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,006
Everyone.

138
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,580
Since you are the guarantor..

139
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,278
..it is important for
you to be there, Akash.

140
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:47,689
Akash, l know that the
bank has seized your house.

141
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,163
But even after what has happened..

142
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,308
..you can still live with us.

143
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,341
For as long as you want.

144
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,610
Really.

145
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,227
Please.

146
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,223
Be there on the 30th.

147
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,065
For once, Do something for others.

148
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,525
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

149
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,813
Oh God.

150
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,553
Why are you following me?

151
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,587
l can't help it, you're
so attractive you know

152
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,387
What happened to you?

153
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,761
l tried to jump from the bridge
after you and the police left..

154
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,334
..and fell down.

155
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,164
And that's all that
happened to you?

156
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,569
l fell on the bridge not
from the bridge. l was so drunk.

157
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:41,171
Did you really want to die?
- No, l was sightseeing.

158
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,682
What happened to you?

159
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,448
l tried again as well.

160
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,248
Jumped in front of a car.

161
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,519
And you failed as well.

162
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,639
So.. are you going to try again?

163
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,607
Hmm.. You too?

164
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,322
What are you doing? Just..

165
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,524
They'll think that we're escaping..

166
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,530
..from the mental
asylum in these clothes.

167
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,303
One more thing.

168
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,371
l've no interest in you.

169
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,434
Zilch.

170
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,537
Get that straight.

171
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,276
l don't know if l
should be relieved..

172
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,620
..or then begin to wonder why
you aren't interested in me?

173
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,185
Not that l want you to
be interested in me.

174
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,588
lf you know what l mean?

175
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,891
What am l doing with you?

176
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,629
Hey.

177
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,869
These scrubs look so funny
from the back, isn't it?

178
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,306
Whatever.

179
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,947
l am Kiara.
- Akash.

180
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:37,551
So.. what is your plan?
- Listen, please leave me alone.

181
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,431
You know, you are very rude

182
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,868
But, l am still asking you.

183
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,934
Can we do this together?

184
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,602
This isn't a game of double
tennis that we can do together

185
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,769
l'm just saying that because..

186
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,372
..l want to make sure it happens.

187
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,918
l've been very dependant in life.

188
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,859
l've always needed.. a push.

189
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,728
So please.

190
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:20,667
Well.. it's strange, but.. fine.

191
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,999
How do you want to do it?

192
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,870
We can go to my house.
- What?

193
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,811
l am not inviting you for coffee.

194
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,610
Whatever.

195
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,516
We can go to your house as well.

196
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,549
l don't have a house.

197
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,461
Stop. Stop. Stop. Here.

198
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,431
Come on.
- This way?

199
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,306
l never have my house keys.

200
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,041
After you.
- Oh no.

201
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,406
You're very smart. l know why
you want to climb up after me.

202
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,007
Come on, l am cold.
- Oh please.

203
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,719
Okay.

204
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,897
Can you push me a little bit?
- With pleasure.

205
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,713
Lights on. Music on.

206
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,981
What the hell.

207
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,015
l hate this song.

208
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,524
Excuse me.

209
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,460
What are you doing?

210
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,095
Making place to sit.

211
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,867
No need to get.. too comfortable.

212
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,335
You're not here to stay.

213
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,784
Let's do what we have to.
- What?

214
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,420
l know, l know.

215
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,420
We've ropes.

216
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,823
We can hang ourselves.

217
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,552
These sprinklers won't be
able to take your weight.

218
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,756
You know you're..
- Do you have plastic wrap?

219
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,958
What will we do with plastic wrap?
- Do you have it?

220
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,831
Okay. Here.

221
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:40,003
Asphyxiation.
- As.. What?

222
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,873
Suffocation.

223
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:44,941
lt's very effective.

224
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,143
You, first take this and
wrap it tightly around my face.

225
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,582
Then l'll wrap it around your's.

226
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,920
Then, when the oxygen stops reaching
our brains, in a few minutes..

227
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,986
..it will stop working.

228
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,089
Let's start.
- Ya.

229
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,938
Okay.

230
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,035
Your face is too long.

231
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,711
Can you breathe?

232
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:20,876
No?

233
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,044
Okay.

234
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,451
Alright.

235
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,184
Now my turn.

236
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,695
Come on.

237
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,121
Alright.

238
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,422
Start already!

239
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,766
Oh my, God. You cheat.

240
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,771
You knew it.. you knew that
you wouldn't be able to help me.

241
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,101
l won't let you die.

242
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,870
You will die and l
will be the murderer.

243
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,639
ls it my fault?

244
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,713
You blindfolded my eyes,
how could l see?

245
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,873
Couldn't you tell me before?

246
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,042
lf you had died,
l would've been jailed.

247
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,820
This is so not going to work.

248
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,584
Oh my, God.

249
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:04,860
l have an idea.

250
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,237
There are just three left.

251
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,203
Okay.

252
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,586
May l?
- Okay.

253
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,828
Paper.
- Paper.

254
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,993
Paper.
- Paper, quickly.

255
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,161
Paper. Paper. Paper.
- Quickly Kiara.

256
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,533
More paper? l'll get it.

257
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,106
More paper. More paper. More paper.
More paper. - More paper.

258
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,537
ls the gas on? ls the gas on?

259
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,703
The gas is on.

260
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,939
Kiara.
- Yes.

261
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,114
When did you last pay your bill?
- Which bill?

262
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,013
Your gas bill.

263
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,121
Your gas connection has been
cut off for the past 2 months

264
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,716
l have never cooked.

265
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,224
How was l supposed to know?

266
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,795
Look, l don't know if
you think this is a joke..

267
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,954
But for me, it isn't

268
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,122
lf you got hold of me

269
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,665
..just to get rid of your loneliness,
then go pick someone else up.

270
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,596
Go to any bar, l'm sure
you'll find someone there.

271
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,193
Butjust leave me alone.

272
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,303
Look, l am..

273
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,548
l am sorry.

274
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,821
l think l know why
this is happening.

275
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,923
Last night we met on the bridge.

276
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,258
Both of us.

277
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,259
But the coast guard arrived.

278
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:56,564
We then tried separately,
but failed.

279
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,174
Then we met in the hospital.

280
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:06,879
Strangely again.. we decided
to commit suicide together.

281
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,613
We came home. Tried twice.

282
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,715
But failed again.

283
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,658
So many attempts in
one day, but all failed.

284
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,191
Why?

285
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,930
Do you believe in signs?

286
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,594
What rubbish is this?

287
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,138
lt's just that you
don't want to die.

288
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,607
l have tried just as
hard as you have, Akash.

289
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:39,715
Maybe you or me have
something left to do in life?

290
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,616
'The bank has
called us on the 30th.'

291
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,880
'For the first time.. do
something for others.'

292
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,951
Okay fine.

293
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,120
Then explain to me
why we are still alive.

294
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,288
'Since you are the guarantor.. '

295
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,896
'.. it is very important
for you to be there, Akash.'

296
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,929
lts rubbish.

297
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,706
lts nonsense, l don't
believe in all this.

298
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,342
Maybe.. maybe you're right.

299
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,804
Let's try again.

300
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,011
Let's try your idea.

301
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,419
And this time we'll be careful.

302
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,244
l am telling you, Akash.

303
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,414
So many signs.

304
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:23,818
There has to be a reason..
something.. that is stopping us.

305
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,921
Should we take some time?

306
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,092
Two days? Four days?

307
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,767
What's the date today?

308
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,271
Seventh.. eighth November..
- 1 1th December.

309
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,401
Yes, right.
1 1th December.

310
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,073
Then 31st December.

311
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,752
Means.. 1 1 , 12, 13, 14..
- 20days.

312
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,915
18, 19..
- lts 20days.

313
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,318
Right.

314
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,951
So 31st December.

315
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,889
New Year's night.

316
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,840
New Year's night.
At 12o'clock.

317
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,013
We'll jump from that bridge.

318
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,041
lts a pact.

319
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,889
But what will we
do in these 20days?

320
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,493
Things to do before you die.

321
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,464
Everyone boasts of things that
they wish to do before they die..

322
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,861
But never end up doing them.

323
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,193
Anything.

324
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,271
Fun, spontaneous, adventurous.

325
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,400
Everyone does it
to enjoy their life.

326
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,141
We'll do it to die!

327
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,044
No, its all nonsense.

328
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,144
l can't do this.

329
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,779
You could neither be a
good son, nor a good friend.

330
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,347
'Akash its over man,
itjust moved too fast.'

331
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,480
'You were always in a hurry
to make it big, weren't you? '

332
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,286
'You wanted to win every race.'

333
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,519
'Shut down the company.'

334
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:43,889
'Sell the office! '

335
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
'All of you were losers.'

336
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,322
'All of you were losers! '

337
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,422
'Where will we go? How
will we repay the loan? '

338
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:52,196
Tell me, how will we pay it back? '

339
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:36,976
EROS

340
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:41,176
So l guess, new year's night

341
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,320
l guess.

342
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:54,229
''Close your eyes when you
don't see your destination.''

343
00:28:55,433 --> 00:29:03,238
''When you close your eyes and
seek you find the path to God.''

344
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,506
''Change your own fate.''

345
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,637
''Have courage and move ahead.''

346
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:15,311
''My footprints will
show you the way.''

347
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,390
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

348
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:27,122
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

349
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:33,328
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

350
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:39,135
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

351
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:45,416
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

352
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:51,251
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

353
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,677
You can't report four
hours late for work.

354
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,371
This is completely ridiculous.

355
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,346
You can'tjust walk-in
whenever you feel like.

356
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,508
You know what, you are fired.

357
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,352
''Take a look at yourself.''

358
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,048
''Why did you give-in to
the situation and give up.''

359
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,390
l was going to quit anyway.

360
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:39,265
''Your courage can
change your destiny.''

361
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:45,240
''Fill your world with
the colour of your dreams.''

362
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,744
''l am always with you.''

363
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,543
''So what if the sun's setting.''

364
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:57,645
''You'll find my threshold
when the darkness sets in.''

365
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:03,387
''And that is where you'll
find new hope once again.'

366
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:09,431
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

367
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:15,469
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

368
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:21,445
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

369
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:27,212
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

370
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:32,182
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

371
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,393
''You're unaware that
God's all around you.''

372
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,298
But why me first?

373
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,534
Because knowing you..

374
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,736
..you must have a strange,
complicated wish.

375
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,445
Or you might not have a wish at all

376
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,748
No, no, of course l do.

377
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,613
Really? Then tell me.

378
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,647
Take your time.

379
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,247
There's no hurry.

380
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,578
Come on.

381
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,907
Have you done everything?

382
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,249
lsn't there anything that
you wanted to do..

383
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,650
..but didn't get the chance to..

384
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,153
..or left it for later

385
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,816
l mean.. there's
got to be something.

386
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,730
There's one thing actually.
- Finally?

387
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,168
Tell me.

388
00:32:54,272 --> 00:33:00,871
Can l.. get a beer?

389
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,743
And that's your wish?

390
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:08,209
l need the beer so that.. l
can tell you what my wish is?

391
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,649
That's nice.

392
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,818
This seems like it's going
to be a really good wish.

393
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,488
Here.

394
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:31,934
So.. l thought l'll wait.

395
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,247
You know for.. for the right girl.

396
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,477
Kiara!

397
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,914
What?
- You were sleeping.

398
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,353
No. No, l wasn't sleeping at all.

399
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,514
How could l sleep..

400
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,353
When l was
listening very carefully..

401
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,949
To everything that you didn't say.

402
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,353
Seriously.

403
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,724
l am a virgin.

404
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,461
Move.

405
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,699
What did you say?
- l have never..

406
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,644
You know..
l have never done it

407
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,276
l never got the time.

408
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,947
First l focused on
studies and then my job.

409
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,681
And it wasn't like l
didn't have my opportunities..

410
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,627
lts just that l was
waiting for the right girl.

411
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,295
What? What is so funny?

412
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:35,501
You're talking like
a 15year old girl.

413
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:40,001
ln fact.. even 15year old
girls don't talk like that here..

414
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,541
lf l had a 15year old daughter
and she didn't talk like this..

415
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,944
..l'd break her legs

416
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,310
l am sure.

417
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,613
But to have a 15year old daughter,
you have to first be a father.

418
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,586
And to be a father.. you have to..
- Yes, l know.

419
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,053
Okay.

420
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,489
But you're a lucky guy.

421
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,356
Because tomorrow's the night.

422
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,829
Where, ladies and gentlemen..

423
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,870
..a wish, a dream will be fulfilled.

424
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,770
A wish will come true.

425
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,532
Akash. Blush.

426
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,905
Blush. Akash.

427
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,572
Are you serious?

428
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,649
Yeah.. lsn't she gorgeous?
- Gorgeous?

429
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,085
She'll feel bad.
She's very sensitive.

430
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,892
She'll feel bad?
- Yes.

431
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,920
Hi, baby, did you miss me
because l missed you too.

432
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,938
You missed me my
blushy-wushy googly-poogly.

433
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,413
Yeah.

434
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,598
Does she work? or are we
just here to pay her a visit?

435
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,065
l know, l know.

436
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,939
He can be a pain but
try to manage tonight.

437
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,140
The party starts now, baby.

438
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,797
What are we doing here, Kiara?

439
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,529
We've got to fulfil
your last wish, remember?

440
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,731
Peshto.

441
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,804
How are you?
- Oh my, God. How have you been?

442
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,468
When did you arrive?
You didn't even call.

443
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,012
l know, l was slightly busy.

444
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,607
Why do girls
always meet each other..

445
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,741
..like they've been just been
let out of the mental asylum.

446
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:01,943
who is he?

447
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,452
That..
- Hi, Akash.

448
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,421
Akash. Oh, the virgin.

449
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,556
lsn't it cute, Sam?

450
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,859
Does everyone in this
club know this? - Peshto.

451
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,988
Not really..
- Kiara. Sam. - Sam, Kiara. - Hi.

452
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,565
Hi.
- Really nice to meet you.

453
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,566
Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

454
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,038
Darling, l got to take this.
- Okay.

455
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,571
God.
- So, did you like Sam?

456
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:26,006
So cute, quite yum, l like him.
- l know.

457
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,477
lsn't he just.. - You do
know that he's married, right?

458
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,740
What?
- What?

459
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,074
No.

460
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,480
l knew it.

461
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,017
He's talking to his wife right now

462
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,952
l can lip-read.

463
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,716
You'll learn to too, if you work
in the stock market long enough.

464
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:45,455
He's telling her that he is out
entertaining some Chinese clients

465
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,191
But he was going to have
dinner with me at Lobo tonight.

466
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,898
There ain't no Lobo tonight,
my darling.

467
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,059
He's going back home.

468
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,693
Darling, l got to go. Some
problem with the shipment, alright.

469
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,465
Bye. Take care.
- Bye.

470
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,700
Bye, guys.
- Bye. Pleasure meeting you.

471
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,002
C'mon Stay back.
- l've to go.

472
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,168
No, stay back.
- l've to go.

473
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,609
What about the party?
- Work. - You..

474
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,236
Work! Bye.

475
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,550
Screw it.

476
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,142
Anyway, he was quite boring.

477
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,153
And there are so
many hot guys in here.

478
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,517
l'll see you guys later.

479
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,750
But listen..
- You guys have fun.

480
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,851
And you.. you're not too bad.

481
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,889
Bye.
- Bye.

482
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,225
Come on.. Let's hit the bar.

483
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,564
Excuse me. Sorry.

484
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,033
Can l have two large jacks, please?

485
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,603
Nice

486
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,534
So this, my friend,
is your playground..

487
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:37,977
New York is officially the
land of the single ladies.

488
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,148
But first, you'll have to
loosen up a little. Just..

489
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,984
l know what, have a drink.

490
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,679
Finish, finish, down, down, finish.

491
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,520
Kiara.

492
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,594
Now we're talking!

493
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,655
Keep your hand on the bar.

494
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,096
Just one hand.

495
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,258
Now Lean.

496
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,962
Like that.

497
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,039
Now, look around.

498
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,933
Look all around.

499
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,508
Please, don't stare like a despo.

500
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,741
Smooth. Just like.. look around.
Scan the place.

501
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,675
Nice.

502
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,277
Now pout.

503
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,110
Slightly. My god!

504
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,984
Okay. Cute.

505
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,115
Okay, so you're ready for the kill.

506
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:28,028
Now.. imagine that a very sexy,
hot girl is standing next to you.

507
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,291
Just imagine me, Now just hit on me

508
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:38,965
Can l get you a drink?
- Why?

509
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,172
Are you a waiter?

510
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,837
No, thanks.

511
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,314
Can l buy you a drink?
- Much better.

512
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,314
Why should l let you buy me a drink?

513
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,183
Because l've been
noticing you for so long..

514
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,125
Please. That's the
tackiest pick-up line ever

515
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,026
l've been noticing you for so long.

516
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,326
l can buy my own drink.

517
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,029
So buy me a drink.

518
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,033
Cheapo.

519
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,335
So can l make you a drink?

520
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,714
Nice. Now that l like.

521
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,050
Hi, l am Akash.

522
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,817
Kiara.
- Unusual name.

523
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,021
Like me.
- Yeah.

524
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,359
l like you.

525
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,902
Nice.. Continue.

526
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:53,108
We've got news.. the
enemy has advanced.

527
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,943
Their men are moving forward.

528
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,121
They've captured most of our men.

529
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,722
We don't have much time

530
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:13,300
But what will happen
if they find you, Gopal?

531
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,129
There's nothing l can do.

532
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,669
Radha, l will have to stay back.

533

For my people.

Till the end.

535
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,346
You will have to leave.
- But what about us?

536
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,388
All those dreams, those promises?

537
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,886
Tell me.

545
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,590

Congrats.

594
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,498
Your first last wish
has been fulfilled.

595
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,130
Cheers.

596
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,139
l couldn't do it.
- Why?

597
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,575
Are you gay?
- No, idiot.

598
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,343
Don't call me an idiot.

599
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,279
Firstly, l try to
help you, and then..

600
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,984
lt's just that l couldn't do it.

601
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,256
You should've told me earlier.

602
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,231
We could've seen a doctor.
Listen, it's a very common problem

603
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,698
Listen, when l say l can't do it..

604
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,703
..l mean with a stranger,
having paid her money

605
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,338
ls it so difficult to understand?

606
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,333
Look at me

607
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,670
You think l didn't
have any girlfriends..

608
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,575
or that l didn't get opportunities.

609
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,545
lt's just that.. l
never felt it was right.

610
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,612
l wanted to wait.. to fall in love.

611
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,484
l know it's stupid. But
that's just the way it is

612
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:11,425
Oh so basically
you've never been in love.

613
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,028
So that's your wish.

614
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,190
Oh, dude.

615
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,425
That's a very
difficult wish to fulfil.

616
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,228
But.. Love isn't easy..

617
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,498
Oh no, just a minute.

618
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,303
l've got an original one.

619
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,574
What wish is one that
can be easily obtained.

620
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,407
What wish is one that
can be easily obtained.

621
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,343
Where there is no
struggle in fulfilling it.

622
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,344
Which once attained,
should feel like an achievement

623
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,447
Or else, life just goes by.

624
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,418
Thank you. Thank you.

625
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,222
That was very bad.

626
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,357
Oh, God. Come on.

627
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:55,299
You've got only 19 days..
to fall in love.

628
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,708
Hey, the car is this way.

629
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:03,640
Are you kidding me?

630
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,781
l don't drink and drive.

631
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,650
Okay, l'll drive.
- Blush!

632
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,785
No way. Only l drive her.

633
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,519
Come on, we're walking.

634
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,865
So the other day..
- Sorry.

635
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,539
Go ahead.
- No, you were saying something.

636
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:38,770
Just that.. we've decided to
live together for 20days.

637
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,248
And we don't even know..

638
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,185
..why we met on the
bridge that night.

639
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,351
Go on.

640
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,753
Stock market crash.

641
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,729
So you lost everything?

642
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,673
And your family?

643
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:10,806
My parents got divorced
when l was eight years old.

644
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,673
They kept fighting
even after the divorce.

645
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,611
My grandfather rescued me,
and brought me here

646
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,155
He educated me, sent me here.

647
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,520
He passed away in 2001 .

648
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,657
And since then l am alone.

649
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:30,622
Where are your parents now?
- l.. don't know.

650
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,230
What do you mean,
you don't know?

651
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,863
You don't even talk to them?

652
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,831
Well, neither do they.

653
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,172
So what, Akash?

654
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,203
Did you even try?

655
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,676
Oh my, God.

656
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:50,418
Say it, i don't care, l didn't
have time, blah, blah, blah.

657
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:54,288
l don't understand
today's generation..

658
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,886
And you took your
parent's permission..

659
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,460
..before committing suicide,
isn't it?

660
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,358
You care a lot for them, don't you?

661
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,860
So..
- What?

662
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:13,433
Your turn.
- Oh look, we're home.

663
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:20,808
Kiara, where are you going?

664
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,885
Come on.

665
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,832
l lived in San
Francisco with my family

666
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:48,638
Kunal and my family had known
each other for a really long time.

667
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,970
Especially since we had
migrated from lndia together

668
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:55,483
And that day, as usual
Kunal forgot my birthday.

669
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,515
l had gotten used to it.

670
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,654
But still used to get angry on him.

671
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,586
He was used to this anger.

672
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,588
Yeah, dad?

673
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:11,366
Oh, Kunal hasn't called yet.
- Goodnight, dad.

674
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:12,729
Goodnight, baby.

675
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,510
l've been trying to
call you all day..

676
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,874
lt either gets directed to voicemail
or you just don't answer it.

677
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,839
Okay, fine.

678
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,442
l thought of calling you

679
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:34,513
And it's you that always says
''lt's the thought that counts''.

680
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,425
l really thought of calling you.

681
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,593
Kiara, it's your birthday.

682
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:43,960
Be nice to people. Smile.

683
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:47,059
lt's my birthday, and l
should be nice to other people?

684
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,428
Yes, let's go now.

685
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,630
Come on, come on that's enough now.

686
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,331
l've got something to show you.

687
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:55,941
Happy birthday to you.

688
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,377
Happy birthday to you.

689
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,917
Look at her, isn't she gorgeous?
- You like her?

690
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,814
Of course, Kunal.
- lsn't it?

691
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,683
You're buying a gift for
yourself on my birthday.

692
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,019
l mean how sweet is that.

693
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,683
But, you do this every year.

694
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,920
Camera. Electric guitar.

695
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:13,461
Home theatre system.
- Enough.

696
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,758
PS3. And now this bike,
Which is for me.

697
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,458
All your gifts are for me.

698
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,000
Thanks so much Kunal,
l am so touched.

699
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,536
l bought the camera to
click your photographs..

700
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,766
And the home theatre, was
for us to watch movies together

701
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:25,967
And the guitar?

702
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,067
That was to compose songs for you

703
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,040
And the PS3?
- PS3?

704
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,006
OK fine, that's one thing,
that l bought for myself.

705
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,745
But this.. is for you to sit on.

706
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:41,050
And you know what.. we
will run away on this

707
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:45,425
Come on.

708
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,970
Hey.

709
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,953
Hey, hi babe.
- Hi.

710
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:13,953
So this is it.

711
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,684
Fourteen days until the wedding..

712
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,657
..and l see what the problem is.

713
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,786
Your living room is your bedroom.

714
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,726
And the bedroom?
- ls more like a storeroom.

715
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,526
Hey, babe, just pass me a beer.
- Yes.

716
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,897
l'll be right back.

717
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,934
Hey, would you like a beer?
- No, thank you

718
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,409
Maybe a glass of wine?

719
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,840
Or.. a cosmo?

720
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,913
l don't drink at work.

721
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:45,446
But here's my card.

722
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,919
Give me a call at night.

723
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,718
l'll drink anything.

724
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,657
Okay, okay, break it up you two.

725
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,093
Emanuel is a dream worker,
aren't you?

726
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,722
Honey, l am your fairy Godmother.

727
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,631
We're going to transform
this place. - Perfect.

728
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,998
He really is a fairy

729
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,196
Cheers.

730
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,132
Be nice.
- Bye, Emanuel.

731
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,199
Okay,
- The DVD collection.

732
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,494
We'll talk later.

733
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,565
And anyway, l am feeling sleepy.

734
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:54,152
What are you doing?
- lts called cleaning.

735
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:57,784
You know, cleaning.
- No, l don't know.

736
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,623
And l don't want to know.

737
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,592
You know, for the first time..

738
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,791
..l don't have anything
to do after 9 o'clock.

739
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,162
So l thought l'd do this.

740
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:10,263
Where did this sofa come from?
- This one?

741
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,038
Yes.
- lt's your sofa.

742
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,838
No.
- Yes.

743
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,845
lt was hidden behind
your pile of clothes.

744
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,841
And yes.. l found your house key.

745
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:24,749
Or should l say.. keys.

746
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,033
Coffee. Low fat.

747
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,002
What. l like full fat.
- You're most welcome.

748
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,268
Day 3, your turn to make a wish

749
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:54,079
Why am l.. so scared of your wish?

750
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,615
Okay.

751
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,848
Let's just forget
about these wishes.

752
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,546
lt's a bad idea anyway.
- Why?

753
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,621
Now that it's my turn,
suddenly it's a bad idea?

754
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,058
lt's not like my wish
has been fulfilled either.

755
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,628
l will get your wish fulfilled.

756
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,564
lt will take time though..
And anyway we've got 19days.

757
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,827
Yeah right.

758
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,260
Tell me.. or l'll just
die out of suspense.

759
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,339
So my wish is that we'll swim..

760
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,837
..in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean, today.

761
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,043
What?
- Yes.

762
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,204
That's dumb.

763
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,010
lts minus two degrees and l
don't indulge in such madness.

764
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:30,745
Oh, so your wish is ''Beautiful,
special, you won't understand''..

765
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,116
..and my wish is dumb?

766
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,089
Kiara, that is suicide.
- Really?

767
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,657
Fine.

768
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,853
ls this why you've kept me alive?

769
00:56:57,213 --> 00:57:03,777
Bathing in the sea has
made you even more salty

770
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,626
Wouldn't it be so easy..

771
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:20,059
to forget everything and
live each day happily..

772
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,830
To fulfil your every wish,
like its your last day

773
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,282
But life always interferes.

774
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,754
Here. Write.
- What?

775
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,860
What you just said?

776
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,861
Live each day like it's your last.

777
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,727
Why?
- Just write it.

778
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,900
Leave.

779
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,981
l wish that someone..

780
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,085
..without a reason
to live, finds this.

781
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,023
l wish that
there's no one like that.

782
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,032
Okay, its bikini time.

783
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,166
Akash, where is my
bag with the swimsuit.

784
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,811
lt must be there.
- l don't really see it.

785
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,148
l am sorry.. l forgot
that bag on the jetty.

786
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,809
What?
- Yes.

787
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,750
No, Akash.
- l am so sorry.

788
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,185
Come on, let's go back.

789
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,348
Just a minute, we
aren't going anywhere.

790
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,926
How will we swim
without our swim suits?

791
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,352
Actually, l can.
- How?

792
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,290
Oh, come on.

793
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,361
l have this.

794
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,502
l am not going to
take off my clothes.

795
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,040
l am not shameless like you.

796
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,245
l am shameless?
- Of course.

797
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,942
There's no one around here for
atleast 10 kilometres, to see you.

798
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,181
Look, l have no
interest in seeing you undress

799
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,916
Hey, watch it.
- What else can l say?

800
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,215
l am very interested
in seeing you undress.

801
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:25,294
But l control myself. Happy?

802
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,330
That's why l think we should go back

803
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,922
Don't put up a charade.

804
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,329
Crazy woman.

805
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,303
Wants to swim here in the cold.

806
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,966
Akash.. My leg..
- Kiara!

807
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,012
Akash.
- Kiara!

808
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,881
Kiara, catch!

809
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,048
Catch!

810
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,052
Oh God.

811
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:04,530
Help! Help! l can't swim.

812
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,324
Akash.

813
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,934
l can't swim.

814
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:11,532
The boat.

815
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,810
The boat's drifting away, Akash.

816
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,847
ls this why you forgot the bag?
because you can't swim.

817
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,319
lf you weren't acting
that you're drowning..

818
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,014
..we wouldn't be here and the
boat wouldn't have drifted away

819
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,591
So, now it's my fault?
- Of course it's your fault.

820
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,486
ls it my fault that you can't swim?

821
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,063
l wonder which era
you've landed here from.

822
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,064
Now, l am stuck with you.

823
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,940
l want to pee.
- What?

824
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,301
Here? Right now?
- Yes.

825
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:51,510
You.. you can't do it here.
- What do you mean?

826
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,548
How long can l control it?
- l don't know.

827
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,050
But doing it in the water,
that's disgusting Akash.

828
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,277
Why.. why don't you
swim a little ahead?

829
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,117
The waves will take it away

830
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,555
A wave like that one.

831
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,427
Akash, what's that?

832
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,430
ls that a shark?

833
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,595
No, no, that's not a shark.

834
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:19,101
lt looks like a floating cloth.

835
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,511
lt looks like someone's boxers.

836
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,348
You pervert.

837
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,358
And l was standing
next to you all this while

838
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,586
Disgusting.

839
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,295
My boxers.

840
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,398
Go get them

841
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,329
l told you l don't know how to swim.

842
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,167
Could you please get them for me?

843
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,570
l am not going to touch your boxers.

844
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:54,006
Please, they'll float away.

845
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,577
And l certainly don't want
to die without them. Please.

846
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,441
Thanks.

847
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:44,015
l am Sorry for all this.
- lts okay.

848
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:49,229
Anyway, you look
rather strange saying sorry.

849
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,231
You're better grumpy.

850
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:09,581
You think we should hug..
lt's very cold.

851
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,271
lts so strange, isn't it?

852
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,548
We tried so hard
to die but couldn't.

853
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,616
And today when we
tried to live a little..

854
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:56,563
Anyway, you didn't
complete your story.

855
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,632
There's no one here
to disturb us now.

856
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,777
Hey, its me Rachael.
Can't wait to see you.

857
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,583
lt's been five months
since that night in LA.

858
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,177
Finally you agreed to see me again.

859
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,750
l forgot to give you my room
number.l am in Hotel Hilton..

860
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:26,090
And the room number is.. same
as the one we were in LA.

861
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:30,527
l'll be waiting..
6pm.. Don't be late.

862
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,247
Hi.
- Hi.

863
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,509
A friend of mine from LA,
her name is Rachael.

864
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,478
Could l have her room number please?

865
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,485
l am sorry l can't give
out that information..

866
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,614
..but l can go ahead and
give her a call for you.

867
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,387
Ya, please.

868
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,353
There she is.

869
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,425
Thank you.

870
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,867
Hi.

871
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,167
What floor?

872
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,441
Same floor.

873
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,518
Have a good night
- You too.

874
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,281
l am ready now, your room is done.

875
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,288
Thanks.

876
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,707
Hello.
- Hey, Kiara.

877
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,284
Hi Babes

878
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,683
Kunal where are you?
- Are you alright.

879
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:35,254
l am at the restaurant, why?

880
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,226
No, it's nothing.

881
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,819
l'll call you later, okay.
- Okay.

882
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:58,863

883
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,876
Hey, can l buy you a drink?

Yeah.

Why god..

886
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:11,640

887
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,911

will run away on this'

889
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:56,088
Why god.. Why is my love so cursed?

890
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:12,465
And my heart
shattered by his betrayal

891
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,054

893

You'll get used to this as well.
- What's wrong?

895
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:48,138
ls there something that you
want to tell me? - No, nothing.

896
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,773
ls there something l
should know, Kunal?

897
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,015
Kiara, what's wrong with you today?

898
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,783
Anyway, l have to go
to the restaurant..

899

902
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,766
Like the one at the Hilton Hotel?

903
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,600
Like the one in room no. 504?

904
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:26,707
Who is she?

905
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,716
Rachael, from LA.

906
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,654
l met her five months ago.

907
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:43,023
And you had the nerve to
give me this when you got back..

908
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,199
No, Kiara. No.

909
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,895
Please. That was the
first and the last time.

910
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:51,037

to tell her that it's over.

912

Kiara, please forgive me.

forgive me as well.

01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,014
But that's not really important.

1053
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,524
l could just carry on
without knowing what it feels like.

1054
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,088
How does it matter?

1055
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,096
Hang on.

1056
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,994
You know what we should do this.

1057
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,628

01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,613

1062
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,340
Hell.
- ls Hell even a place?

1063
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:24,509
lt's in Michigan.

1064
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:25,916
Do you want to go there?

1065
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,385
Are you mad?

1066
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,547
Did l hit it right this time?

1067
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:30,783

1068

Dude, you've no idea
how much fun we'll have.

1073
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,574
Alright, let's go to Vegas.

1074
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,404
But we don't have the
money to take a flight.

1075
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:56,143
l'll inquire about
the greyhound bus.

1076
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:06,385

Let me see what's wrong?

1112
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:12,109
Wait here, l'll check.

1113
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:23,681

What's so funny?

1115
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,791
Come on, start the car.

1116
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:36,995
Are you okay?

1117
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:40,768
Are you okay baby? Did you get
hurt? - Why are you taking so long?

1118
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:44,103
For God's sake, you're talking
to this piece of crap again.

1119
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,679
Okay, okay, l am starting.

1120
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,838
Start now.

1121
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,244
Good girl.

1122
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:53,745
Okay.

1123
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,131
What is it?
- Haven't you learned to share?

1124
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:12,830
l want to go to the bathroom.

1125
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,400
Yes, but we just crossed a sign..

1126
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:18,906
..saying that there isn't a bathroom
for the next 30 miles - What?

1127
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:20,939
l can't wait that long.

1128
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,881
Listen, l am not going to stop the
car in the middle of the desert.

1129
01:30:24,185 --> 01:30:26,085
l don't know whether this
piece of crap will start up again.

1130
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:27,778
Control it forjust half an hour.

1131
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,023
l can't, Akash.

1132
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:32,855
Did you let me do it
in the water that day?

1133
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,121
l didn't say that l
want to do it in the car.

1134
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:38,789
And what is this like.. pee revenge.

1135
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,424
You didn't let me do it..
so l won't let you do it

1136
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,727
l need to go means l need to go.
- Okay, okay.

1137
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:51,172
l can't pee here, Akash?

1138
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,042
There's not a single tree around.

1139
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,848
Drive a little further.

1140
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,310
That's it, you've got two options.

1141
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:02,412
Either you get down here, or
then wait for half an hour.

1142
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:05,052
l won't go searching the entire
desert for a tree for you to pee.

1143
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,386
Fine.

1144
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:19,998
Akash.
- What?

1145
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:22,307
What if there are snakes here?

1146
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,275
There can't be any
snakes here, Kiara.

1147
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:27,380
How do you know that?
- Well, because it's too bloody hot.

1148
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:29,181
And they aren't
fools like us, you know.

1149
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:32,480
Listen, please come with me.

1150
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,277
lf l have to come with you,
then why notjust pee right here..

1151
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:35,787
..why do you want to
go all the way there?

1152
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,858
Just come please.

1153
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:46,866
Let's go.

1154
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,767
Okay.

1155
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,201
Okay, okay, stop, stop.

1156
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:54,035
Now turn around..

1157
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,976
..and close your eyes.

1158
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,472
Kiara, my back is facing you..

1159
01:31:57,778 --> 01:31:59,837
..why should l close my eyes..
- Just do it, quickly.

1160
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:03,016
Fine.
- Ok, now shut your ears as well.

1161
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:04,744
What?
- Shut your ears..

1162
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,752
..and imagine that
you're somewhere else.

1163
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,152
l am feeling shy, Akash..
- Fine, fine.

1164
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,256
My eyes are closed,
so are my ears..

1165
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,759
..and l am somewhere else.

1166
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:15,226
Okay.

1167
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:22,530
Oh shit.

1168
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:25,267
Stop! Stop!

1169
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,467
Stop! Stop!

1170
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:33,775
Hey, stop.

1171
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:38,083
Oh my God. They took Blush.
- Stop.

1172
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:40,552
Why did you stop chasing them?

1173
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:41,947
Why didn't you stop them?

1174
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,114
Why didn't you stop..

1175
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,452
Should l have turned into
spiderman, and flown behind them?

1176
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,550
At least the car would've been here.

1177
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,496
Blush!

1178
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:30,468
Water.

1179
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,112
Akash.

1180
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:52,557
What?
- Come.

1181
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,359
What?

1182
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:48,510
Oh my, God.

1183

1184
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:53,654
Oh look, there is Blush.
- Oh my Blush.

1185
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,518
My baby.

1186
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,922
Where are you going?

1187
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:01,492
To get the keys from those thieves.

1188
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:03,290
How? Do you even have a plan?

1189
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:07,363
l am not going to go
inside a shady place like this.

1190
01:35:08,436 --> 01:35:11,428
But of course, ''Mr. Been
there but never done it.''

1191
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,598
You know what, you stay here
while go in and get the keys.

1192
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,594
Just come in
- But..

1193
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:41,999
Look! There they are.

1194
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,335
But what if they recognise us?

1195
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:46,596
Your face was all black, remember?

1196
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,302
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1197
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,241
Kiara, you really
don't need to do this.

1198
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:57,010
ln fact, l won't let you do this.

1199
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:58,613
l'll think of a
different plan, come on.

1200
01:35:59,286 --> 01:36:00,617
Who said l am doing anything?

1201
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:03,019
You're on in five seconds.

He has fallen in love with me.

1253

You know, we're
crazy about each other.

1254
01:39:36,503 --> 01:39:38,368

Oh my, God.

How did you manage
to send him inside?

1264
01:39:58,459 --> 01:39:59,721
Well, he has gone in
to shave his chest hair

1265
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,421
l just told him that l
hate chest hair.. - Really?

1266
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:03,860
Can we discuss this later?

1267
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:05,261
Run.

1268
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:09,700
''The breeze is blowing slowly now.''

1269
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:14,399
''The way is opening for us now.''

1270
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:18,638
''The destination is close.''

1271
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:23,474
''Like the vast blue sky.''

1272
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:27,020
''The breeze is blowing slowly now.''

1273
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:28,615
Oh my, God. Akash, do something.

1274
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:30,246
What should l do? You do something.

1275
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:31,415
They're coming.

1276
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:32,583
Do something. Your car has stopped.

1277
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:33,751
Speak to her.

1278
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,294
Blush, all is well. All is well.

1279
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:38,331
lt has started, it has started.

1280
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,662
We're not done with you.

1281
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:42,326
Wait.

1282
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,531
Oh, God.

1283
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,473
That was so much fun.

1284
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:53,569
Please. What if
something had happened?

1285
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,307
l could've never
faced anyone again.

1286
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,646
At least your last wish
would've been fulfilled.

1287
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:06,356
Oh God.

1288
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:18,599
''Everybody come and party.''

1289
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:23,640
''Everybody let's party.''

1290
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:31,782
Thank you.

..And l almost..

1294
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:54,072
And thank you.. for doing so much..

1295
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:57,673
You too look strange saying sorry.

1296
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,541
So where are we staying?

1297
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:06,515
MGM. Venetian, Bellagio.

1298
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:09,880
With just 50 dollars,

1299
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,422
Let us not get too
greedy with raised collars,

1300
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:14,952
..staying in a motel is not a sin..

1301
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:18,395
..let's just settle for
our very own.. Happy lnn!

1302
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:33,403
Wow.

1303
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:36,380
This was my dream.

1304
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:40,518
To come to Vegas and stay here.

1305
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:43,783
Thanks, Akash.

1306
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,619
You know l never understand..

1307
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:48,456
..when you're serious
and when you're joking.

1308
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:58,067
ln any case, l am not
staying here for long.

1309
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,037
l am going to win a lot
of money in the casino..

1310
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,973

''A saga young and old.''

1315
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:25,848
By the way.. you can
come without the shirt.

1316
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,820
l don't mind.

1317
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,089
''Until you arrived.''

1318
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:39,830

''Covertly this
story has moved ahead.''

1323

''lt was at a standstill,
until you arrived.''

1324
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:04,093
''Your presence made me realise..''

1325
01:45:04,197 --> 01:45:07,257
''..that you're my reason to live.''

1326

''And l don't know why..
but l feel good''

1327
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,872
''Your presence made me realise..''

01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,313
''..that every
journey turned beautiful.''

1329

''And l don't know why..

01:45:53,213 --> 01:46:00,176
''A new direction.''

''New paths everywhere.''

you became my destination.''

1334

''And l don't know why..

1343
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:32,070
Kiara, hi.
- Peshto.

1344
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:34,007
Hi.

1345
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:37,849
Hi!

1346
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,848
You, here?
- You, here? - Oh God.

1347
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,922
Kiara!
- Natasha.

1348
01:47:43,023 --> 01:47:44,923
Akash.
- Peshto.

1349
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:46,250
How are you?

1350
01:47:46,359 --> 01:47:47,451
Guess what?

1351
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:49,922
l've finally found my Mr. Perfecto.

1352
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:52,157
Really! ln a week?

1353
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:54,893
l met him on the flight,
- Yes, but..

1354
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:57,999
You know when something
feels right from within..

1355
01:48:01,174 --> 01:48:02,368
Yes.

1356
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:03,738
Okay, come on.

1357
01:48:03,844 --> 01:48:04,902
There's a big party upstairs.
Let's go.

1358
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:24,294
''Come on.''

1359
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:55,879
You came back?

1360
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:08,325
You are drunk Kiara.
- Excellent observation.

1361
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:15,601
You know, Akash, if
l didn't know you..

1362
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:19,844
..l would feel that you
were slightly jealous.

1363
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:23,516
Because you left so quietly.

1364
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:33,320
So.. were you jealous
because l was enjoying myself?

1365
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:38,255
..or because l was
enjoying without you?

1366
01:50:40,433 --> 01:50:42,424
lf you were really
enjoying so much..

1367
01:50:43,903 --> 01:50:45,370
..then why would you be here?

1368
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,565
How can you be so sure each time?

1369
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:52,509
So Logical?

1370
01:50:53,113 --> 01:50:54,944
So Confident?

1371
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:09,256
Go to sleep, Kiara.

1372
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:12,122
We've to got to leave
early in the morning

1373
01:51:15,368 --> 01:51:17,393
But we've still got the night.

1374
01:51:24,577 --> 01:51:26,511
Running away from every situation.

1375
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:30,639
There are some things
about you that don't change.

1376
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:35,554
This isn't funny anymore, Kiara.

1377
01:51:36,089 --> 01:51:38,182
l never said l was joking.

1378
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:52,592
Good morning.

1379
01:52:58,138 --> 01:52:59,298
Coffee, ma'am.

1380
01:52:59,405 --> 01:53:01,134
Black, low-fat.

1381
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:06,278
Are you okay?

1382
01:53:09,582 --> 01:53:11,015
What's wrong, Kiara?

1383
01:53:18,658 --> 01:53:25,325
Why do l feel.. that l
am cheating on Kunal?

1384
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:33,399
Last night..

1385
01:53:39,512 --> 01:53:41,480
Why am l feeling so guilty?

1386
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:50,553
You know even the other day..
l didn't do anything.

1387
01:53:51,691 --> 01:53:55,684
l left the bar with that man.

1388
01:54:08,808 --> 01:54:11,675
''l am sorry.. l can't do this.''

1389
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:18,818
Akash, l can't do this to Kunal.

1390
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:26,784
l have imagined my
entire life with him.

1391
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,387
Since l was three years old.

1392
01:54:34,901 --> 01:54:39,565
And.. it has always
been Kunal, for me.

1393
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:48,873
And maybe.. it will always be Kunal.

1394
01:54:59,158 --> 01:55:01,319
You didn't betray him
last night either, Kiara.

1395
01:55:06,666 --> 01:55:08,463
There is nothing between us.

1396
01:55:10,303 --> 01:55:12,396
Last night too,
nothing happened between us

1397
01:55:21,614 --> 01:55:24,242
Black, low-fat.

1398
01:55:28,554 --> 01:55:30,351
l like full fat.

1399
01:55:31,624 --> 01:55:33,353
You're most welcome.

1400
01:55:33,927 --> 01:55:35,326
Thanks.

1401
01:55:39,365 --> 01:55:42,357

Akash, will you say something?

1424

Weren't we going home?

Why were we on that
bridge that night, Kiara?

1429
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:44,879
What's the point of this discussion?

1430
01:58:45,384 --> 01:58:49,377
Because both of us had lost the
one thing we loved the most in life.

1431

Think about it Kiara

1432
01:58:52,024 --> 01:58:54,925
We met on that bridge,
our story began from there.

1433
01:58:55,495 --> 01:58:58,362
But that doesn't mean
it has to end there.

1434
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:00,861
We tried to die so many times.

1435
01:59:01,667 --> 01:59:02,964
How many chances did we give death?

1436
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:06,435
Five.

1437
01:59:07,173 --> 01:59:08,538
And life?

1438
01:59:09,942 --> 01:59:12,433
How many times did we
try to solve our problems?

1439
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:13,739
Sit down and face them?

1440
01:59:17,116 --> 01:59:18,515
Not even once.

1441
01:59:19,585 --> 01:59:21,052
And we say that life's not fair.

1442
01:59:24,957 --> 01:59:27,152
ln these past few days
l have learnt that..

1443
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:31,723
..no matter how many
reasons you have to die..

1444
01:59:35,668 --> 01:59:37,659
..you need just one to live.

1445
01:59:38,804 --> 01:59:40,601
l found your reason, Kiara.

1446
01:59:42,475 --> 01:59:44,705
You have a beautiful family,
you have Kunal.

1447
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:46,774
Everything can go
back to what it was.

1448
01:59:46,946 --> 01:59:48,573
lf you just give him a chance.

1449
01:59:49,749 --> 01:59:51,182
You still love him, Kiara.

1450
01:59:57,990 --> 02:00:02,154
You're doing all this
because l don't love you, Akash.

1451
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:05,122
You're very bad at
handling rejection.

1452
02:00:05,231 --> 02:00:08,428
lt's not about me, Kiara. - Oh
yeah Mr. Hotshot Wall Street guy.

1453
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:10,968
You're actually thinking
about someone else, wow.

1454
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:16,637
Yes, Kiara, maybe l can
think about someone else.

1455
02:00:18,945 --> 02:00:21,004
l'm not saying that Kunal
didn't do anything wrong.

1456
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:24,073
But that's what a mistake means.

1457
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:27,616
lt is possible for
you love someone,,

1458
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,982
..but make the mistake by
straying away with someone else.

1459
02:00:32,258 --> 02:00:34,488
lt could've happened
with you too last night.

1460
02:00:35,628 --> 02:00:36,959
lt's possible, Kiara.

1461
02:00:40,266 --> 02:00:41,631
Go back to him.

1462
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:44,829
You know your
happiness lies with him.

1463
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,207
Everything can be just as it was.

the luckiest girl in the world.

What is your address?

l am sorry, Akash.

1469
02:01:34,954 --> 02:01:38,515
For all that l said
in a fit of rage..

1470

02:11:13,632 --> 02:11:17,830
Dad, Akash here.

1577
02:11:51,637 --> 02:11:57,769
''Since l found out that l'll
never get to know you again.''

1578
02:11:57,876 --> 02:12:02,836
''l started keeping away from love.''

1579
02:12:04,283 --> 02:12:10,586
''Since l realised l will
never think about you again.''

1580
02:12:10,689 --> 02:12:15,217
''my heart always made some excuse''

1581
02:12:15,727 --> 02:12:22,428
''Everything we didn't speak about.''

1582
02:12:22,534 --> 02:12:29,303
''Why didn't you ever say them?''

1583
02:12:29,408 --> 02:12:32,571
''There's so much to say.''

1584
02:12:32,678 --> 02:12:34,578
''Happiness is waiting
with arms stretched,''

1585
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:40,778
''but l can still feel the void''

1586
02:12:40,886 --> 02:12:47,348
''Though he was a stranger.''

1587
02:12:47,559 --> 02:12:53,759
''But he was mine.''

1588
02:12:53,865 --> 02:13:00,270
''She might be a stranger.''

1589
02:13:00,372 --> 02:13:07,540
''But she's somewhere around.''

1590
02:13:23,595 --> 02:13:25,290
You look beautiful, Peshto.

1591
02:13:26,431 --> 02:13:29,229
Thanks, you look great too.

1592
02:13:29,534 --> 02:13:30,592
Thank you.

1593
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:37,340
You know, he loves you a lot.
- Yeah, l know.

1594
02:13:38,443 --> 02:13:40,308
But he isn't as lucky as Kunal.

1595
02:13:45,784 --> 02:13:47,547
Who are you talking about?

1596
02:13:47,686 --> 02:13:48,983
Come on, you girls.

1597
02:13:57,429 --> 02:13:58,521
31st December.

1598
02:13:58,630 --> 02:14:01,565
New year night. 12'clock.

1599
02:14:01,733 --> 02:14:03,667
We will jump from that bridge.

1600
02:14:11,309 --> 02:14:12,776
Attention, guys.

1601
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:14,706
To Peshto and Nikhil.

1602
02:14:15,313 --> 02:14:16,644
The first wedding in our group.

1603
02:14:17,482 --> 02:14:20,849
Here's wishing you guys a
long and happy marriage.

1604
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:24,014
And if anybody has any objections,
now is the time to say it.

1605
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:26,949
Cheers everybody.

1606
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:29,893
Wow, super.

1607
02:14:48,346 --> 02:14:50,337
'Do you believe in signs? '

1608
02:14:56,822 --> 02:14:59,450
Your coffee, black. Low fat.

1609
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:04,629
'Coffee, low fat.'

1610
02:15:10,669 --> 02:15:11,761
Who is he?

1611
02:15:13,805 --> 02:15:15,033
Tell me.

1612
02:15:19,678 --> 02:15:24,012
l am sure, this time
l've lost you forever.

1613
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:28,819
And this time, l am not wrong.

1614
02:15:33,458 --> 02:15:34,618
You're right.

1615
02:15:34,993 --> 02:15:40,522
So, who is he?
- Kunal..

1616
02:15:41,766 --> 02:15:43,393
His name isn't Kunal.

1617
02:15:45,637 --> 02:15:47,764
l don't even know what it is.

1618
02:15:50,475 --> 02:15:52,773
l have only known him for the
past 20 days and it feels like

1619
02:15:52,878 --> 02:15:54,743
You can never forget him.

1620
02:15:57,082 --> 02:15:58,947
Yeah!

1621
02:16:02,187 --> 02:16:04,052
And maybe l'll never meet him again.

1622
02:16:07,025 --> 02:16:09,994
l don't even know where he is.

1623
02:16:10,962 --> 02:16:12,930
Or where he stays or where he'll be

1624
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,697
l don't even have his phone number.

1625
02:16:23,909 --> 02:16:25,433
All l know is that tonight..

1626
02:16:25,544 --> 02:16:28,138
..we were supposed
to meet in New York.

1627
02:16:29,014 --> 02:16:30,106
So?

1628
02:16:32,017 --> 02:16:34,611
So what?
- Go.

1629
02:16:37,455 --> 02:16:39,923
He won't be there.
- How can you be so sure?

1630
02:16:40,058 --> 02:16:41,218
Because..

1631
02:16:46,798 --> 02:16:50,859
Oh my, God. Peshto.
l am not sure.

1632
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:53,662
He could be there.

1633
02:16:54,606 --> 02:16:56,073
l didn't even think about it.

1634
02:16:57,576 --> 02:16:59,203
l should go, right?
- Yes.

1635
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:01,638
But l have to be
there by 12 o'clock.

1636
02:17:01,746 --> 02:17:02,804
What is the time now?
- lts 1 o'clock.

1637
02:17:02,914 --> 02:17:04,006
And what is the time
difference in New York.

1638
02:17:04,115 --> 02:17:05,707
Three hours.

1639
02:17:05,817 --> 02:17:07,580
There's a flight to
New York every hour.

1640
02:17:10,789 --> 02:17:14,691
l'll take you there.
- Kunal.

1641
02:17:15,493 --> 02:17:16,755
Well, what are friends for?

1642
02:17:25,237 --> 02:17:28,172
You guys are so cute.

1643
02:18:06,278 --> 02:18:09,076
Kunal, l just want to tell you..
- Just go, Kiara.

1644
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:12,877
Get the hell out of here now.
- Thanks, Kunal.

1645
02:18:12,984 --> 02:18:14,042
Go, go, go.

1646
02:18:28,199 --> 02:18:29,826
See you.

1647
02:18:30,802 --> 02:18:32,736
What happened to the house?

1648
02:18:36,107 --> 02:18:40,737
There's still one hour to
go for it to be 12 o'clock.

1649
02:18:41,813 --> 02:18:43,838
At least go and see
whether she's there or not

1650
02:18:47,819 --> 02:18:51,880
She is happy where she is.

1651
02:18:53,191 --> 02:19:13,875
EROS

1652
02:19:14,179 --> 02:19:15,271
Taxi.

1653
02:19:18,249 --> 02:19:19,910
Towards the
Washington bridge please.

1654
02:19:20,018 --> 02:19:21,144
Make it fast!

1655
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:41,363
''God. ls the sun
shining somewhere far?''

1656
02:19:43,074 --> 02:19:54,008
''You and l have found a
reason to live again.''

1657
02:19:54,219 --> 02:20:00,749
''lf you want we can find
our destination again.''

1658
02:20:00,859 --> 02:20:07,856
''Our paths will cross again.''

1659
02:20:07,966 --> 02:20:19,138
''l am running
towards where my world is.''

1660
02:20:19,444 --> 02:20:26,111
''Though he was a stranger.''

1661
02:20:26,217 --> 02:20:32,178
''But he was mine.''

1662
02:20:32,290 --> 02:20:38,889
''She might be a stranger.''

1663
02:20:38,997 --> 02:20:46,267
''But she's somewhere around.''

1664
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:15,159
You're getting married?

1665
02:21:36,387 --> 02:21:37,752
Why?

1666
02:21:38,957 --> 02:21:40,151
Are you proposing to me?

1667
02:21:43,962 --> 02:21:45,054
You?

1668
02:21:46,297 --> 02:21:49,960
Remember.. l have no interest in you

1669
02:21:51,503 --> 02:21:52,936
Zilch

1670
02:21:54,506 --> 02:21:58,101
l don't know if l
should be relieved..

1671
02:21:58,209 --> 02:22:01,474
..or then begin to wonder why
you aren't interested in me?

1672
02:22:02,113 --> 02:22:04,172
Not that l want you to
be interested in me.

1673
02:22:06,951 --> 02:22:08,043
You know what l mean?

1674
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:10,978
Then what are you doing here?

1675
02:22:17,996 --> 02:22:19,293
You're all dressed up

1676
02:22:21,432 --> 02:22:24,265
Yeah and l've done my hair too.

1677
02:22:27,472 --> 02:22:30,202
You do know that we're
going to jump into the water?

1678
02:22:31,276 --> 02:22:34,302
And your hair will
get really messed up.

1679
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:36,538
Probably.

1680
02:22:36,848 --> 02:22:38,782
Because jumping from here..

1681
02:22:38,883 --> 02:22:40,145
..is like jumping from the
100th floor of a building.

1682
02:22:41,386 --> 02:22:44,947
Splat! as soon as you land.

1683
02:22:46,424 --> 02:22:52,294
Do you have a better option?
- Yeah, there is another one..

1684
02:22:53,097 --> 02:22:54,359
But it's slightly romantic.

1685
02:22:55,233 --> 02:22:57,098
lnstead ofjumping from here..

1686
02:22:57,969 --> 02:22:59,800
..we could just go down
and walk into the water.

1687
02:23:00,238 --> 02:23:03,036
Oh my, God. lts really cold.

1688
02:23:03,942 --> 02:23:05,807
Just a little bit longer.

1689
02:23:06,411 --> 02:23:08,003
And we won't even feel it anymore

1690
02:23:13,117 --> 02:23:17,952
So.. it was really nice knowing you.

1691
02:23:21,993 --> 02:23:23,085
Yes, you too.

1692
02:23:32,103 --> 02:23:34,833
lt's cold.
- Really.

1693
02:23:39,344 --> 02:23:41,471
lsn't the moon
looking so pretty today?

1694
02:23:44,215 --> 02:23:47,309
Why are you talking like a girl?

1695
02:23:48,086 --> 02:23:49,485
Really?
- Yes.

1696
02:23:49,587 --> 02:23:50,986
Oh my, God. Akash, look.

1697
02:23:51,289 --> 02:23:52,881
What?
- That's our bottle. Over there.

1698
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:54,049
Where?

1699
02:23:54,158 --> 02:23:55,557
There.
- No, that can't be our bottle.

1700
02:23:55,660 --> 02:23:58,993
Wait, l'll go get it.
- Kiara.

1701
02:23:59,230 --> 02:24:01,858
Our bottle.
- Kiara.

1702
02:24:03,001 --> 02:24:05,902
Kiara. Kiara.
- l got it.

1703
02:24:06,504 --> 02:24:11,134
Are you okay? you okay?

1704
02:24:11,242 --> 02:24:13,369
Look, this isn't out bottle..

1705
02:24:13,478 --> 02:24:15,002
..but there's a note
inside this one too

1706
02:24:17,949 --> 02:24:19,075
Alright.

1707
02:24:20,084 --> 02:24:23,611
We tried to die
together many times..

1708
02:24:23,921 --> 02:24:25,616
..and it was so much fun.

1709
02:24:26,024 --> 02:24:31,326
Just imagine.. how great it would
be if we decided to live together.

1710
02:24:31,963 --> 02:24:34,363
l don't want to think,
l just want to live..

1711
02:24:34,499 --> 02:24:37,093
..with you. Kiara.

1712
02:24:39,003 --> 02:24:40,903
Forever and ever.

1713
02:24:41,272 --> 02:24:42,500
Till the day l die.

1714
02:24:42,707 --> 02:24:44,231
Akash

1715
02:24:44,409 --> 02:24:45,933
Oh my, God.

1716
02:24:46,344 --> 02:24:47,538
Akash

1717
02:24:49,180 --> 02:24:50,238
What is this?

1718
02:24:50,682 --> 02:24:51,944
Oh my, God.

1719
02:24:52,116 --> 02:24:54,584
lt's a ring. Where
did this come from?

1720
02:24:54,686 --> 02:24:55,948
Finally.

1721
02:24:57,989 --> 02:24:59,081
Where did you get it from?

1722
02:24:59,323 --> 02:25:01,257
Kiara, l am proposing to you.

1723
02:25:01,592 --> 02:25:04,459
Oh, sorry.
- Continue.

1724
02:25:05,029 --> 02:25:06,929
Kiara, will you.

1725
02:25:10,001 --> 02:25:12,469
Oh my, God. lt's you again.

1726
02:25:12,570 --> 02:25:15,095
Oh no. You dropped the ring.

1727
02:25:15,239 --> 02:25:16,570
Come on.

1728
02:25:16,674 --> 02:25:18,642
Come on.

1729
02:25:20,144 --> 02:25:22,510
Could you dim the light please?

1730
02:25:22,613 --> 02:25:23,705
You're killing the mood.

1731
02:25:30,354 --> 02:25:32,686
Akash
- So, will you..

1732
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:38,586
Kiara. Kiara. Kiara.

1733
02:25:39,764 --> 02:25:42,255
Yes, l will. l will.

1734
02:25:42,366 --> 02:25:43,697
ls it a yes?
- Yes.

1735
02:25:44,736 --> 02:25:46,499
You found the ring?
- Yes.

1736
02:25:46,604 --> 02:25:48,071
And l said yes as well.

1737
02:25:48,172 --> 02:25:50,072
Then why don't you wear it.

1738
02:25:50,308 --> 02:25:52,208
Stupid, you are
supposed to make me wear it

1739
02:25:52,310 --> 02:25:54,278
But if you want l
can wear it myself.

1740
02:25:54,378 --> 02:25:56,403
No wait, give me the ring.

1741
02:26:00,284 --> 02:26:02,218
Your fingers are quite fat.

1742
02:26:02,553 --> 02:26:03,713
No, they are not.

1743
02:26:04,021 --> 02:26:06,148
They just tend to
swell up when it's cold.

1744
02:26:06,524 --> 02:26:08,048
Shall we put the ring on
the little finger then?

1745
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:09,217
Yes.

1746
02:26:11,696 --> 02:26:13,095
There.

1747
02:26:13,698 --> 02:26:15,359
Your wish has been fulfilled.

1748
02:26:18,302 --> 02:26:20,770
Well that's going to happen a little
later, if you know what l mean

1749
02:26:22,106 --> 02:26:23,596
l love you Kiara.

1750

the situation and give up.''
