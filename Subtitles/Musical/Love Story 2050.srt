1
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:38,402
Excuse me sir, can I interrupt you?

2
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,273
It's about Karan.

3
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:43,077
I said, not today.

4
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,481
But he is already here sir.

5
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:46,142
Then send him back.

6
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,217
15 years, and you don't
know how to make an excuse.

7
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:53,722
I can't stop my 60 million dollar
takeover for his silly weekend trip.

8
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,518
Alba, I don't care how
you do it! But avoid him!

9
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,090
Sorry about that!

10
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,758
Karan!

11
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,730
You must know he didn't mean it.

12
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,574
Hey Karan, we had a great holiday.
And missed you a lot.

13
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:23,085
How was your Europe trip?

14
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,655
You already know it, friend.

15
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,356
What happened, did your
dad turn you down you again.

16
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,189
The story of my life!

17
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:30,593
See you Karan!

18
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:32,131
Let's go boys!

19
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:43,404
'I can't stop my 60 million dollar
takeover for his silly weekend trip. '

20
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:56,447
He has taken your car.

21
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:58,148
Doesn't matter. It's okay.

22
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:01,050
Not the M. G!

23
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:14,164
God.

24
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,601
Dad could have killed me.

25
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,041
Excuse me!

26
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,640
What are you doing with my car?

27
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,518
That's my favorite car, Karan!

28
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:27,644
I know, dad.

29
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,779
That's why I took it.

30
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:30,652
Come back to the office, now!

31
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,782
I did come to the office, dad!

32
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:33,150
I was busy at that time.

33
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,484
Now I am!

34
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:36,324
Well, sometime later
we will plan this trip.

35
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,988
I am on a trip, dad.

36
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,189
Not a scratch on my car, Karan!

37
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,701
Don't worry dad, there
won't be a single scratch.

38
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,070
Not a single scratch.

39
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:00,746
'Not a scratch on my car, Karan! '

40
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:02,613
'Not a scratch on my car, Karan! '

41
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,623
Honestly, I am tired of you Karan!

42
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:23,365
I am tired of shouting!

43
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,766
Why do you always shout dad?

44
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,235
Why don't you ever talk to me!

45
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,169
Talk! What do you want me to do?

46
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:34,305
Tell you stories?

47
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,046
You are not a child anymore Karan!

48
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:40,644
Excellent dad!

49
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,385
At least you know how
old this trouble maker is!

50
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:44,720
Don't change the topic!

51
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:50,724
My M. G! My favorite car!
Custom made pars!

52
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:52,730
It hasn't been
even three months yet!

53
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,590
And the car is a wreck!

54
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:55,725
Isn't it funny dad!

55
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:01,637
You have more feelings for a car
than for your 23 year old son?

56
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,265
What do you care for?

57
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:05,402
This house! The cars! Companies!

58
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,275
One day, it will all be yours.

59
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,011
But you will only realize
the value of everything...

60
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:13,279
...when you will lose it.

61
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:17,022
And when will you
realize the value of your son...

62
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,024
...when you will lose me?

63
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:20,721
Karan!

64
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:30,627
Good night dad!

65
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:40,142
Mom! No mom, this is not fair!

66
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:43,508
Today, I won't let
you take dad's side.

67
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:50,980
I feel very lonely, mom.

68
00:07:52,592 --> 00:07:53,991
I really miss you.

69
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:58,988
When I go out, no one says...

70
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:01,590
...'Son, take care of yourself. '

71
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:06,596
When I come home,
no one says to me...

72
00:08:08,074 --> 00:08:09,132
...Karan, have you come...

73
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:15,138
No one ever says, eat
on time, sleep on time.

74
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:17,674
Don't watch the T.V.

75
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:20,347
Don't shake your leg!

76
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:23,619
Get a hair cut, for Christ sake!

77
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,722
No one says anything at all!

78
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,561
I really miss you mom!

79
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,503
Hey Karan!

80
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:48,705
My man!

81
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:50,978
What's up!

82
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:52,642
What is the matter?

83
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,981
Did uncle...

84
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,551
Leave it. It's okay!

85
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:58,315
Okay, forget about it.

86
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:00,985
We have brought something for you...

87
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,052
...which you will not want to miss.

88
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,254
Guess what?

89
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:08,195
Tickets for the
Adelaide X-treme Sports Event!

90
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,392
Yeah baby!

91
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:10,527
And let's see what it says!

92
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:16,007
1 week of certified fun
for Mr. Karan Malhotra...

93
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:19,636
...starting tomorrow at 9 A. M!

94
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:42,323
Sana, come here.

95
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,163
Just a second.

96
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,019
Sunny, Please!

97
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,145
Sheena, I don't want you here!

98
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,245
Just go!

99
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:45,551
...the car racing starts in an hour.

100
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,422
...the grand bike.

101
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:51,021
The first is Streets...

102
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:55,090
Sana, I am going to
have another breakup!

103
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:57,628
But you just had one last
month, didn't you Sheena?

104
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:58,762
No!

105
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,233
That was with Shekar!
Now it's with Sandy!

106
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,667
Sandy is a very cool guy!

107
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,635
But, I am bad luck for him.

108
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:08,307
We have gone on two dates.

109
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:10,178
And everything
possible has gone wrong.

110
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,183
Who told you that you
are responsible for this?

111
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:13,309
Sandy!

112
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:16,780
And, today he is
taking part in a race.

113
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,685
And what if he lost because of me.

114
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:22,459
No Sheena, don't worry!

115
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:23,654
Don't worry!

116
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,788
I will talk to him!

117
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,123
Either he won't take
part in this race.

118
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,325
And if he does, he will have to win.

119
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:31,327
Where is he?

120
00:12:31,404 --> 00:12:32,803
Come on! There! There!

121
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,598
There he is! There he is!

122
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:37,074
Where?
- There!

123
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:40,478
Near the bike. - Don't tell
him that I have sent you, okay!

124
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,013
Actually tell him!

125
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,139
And, you will handle
it, right! - Yes, yes.

126
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:45,081
Fine, handle everything.
- But where are you going?

127
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:48,654
What's in that place?

128
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,656
Damn easy.

129
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:54,219
Alright buddy, you be careful.

130
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,421
Alright mate, you have a good one.
- This is Karan. You are Billy.

131
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,164
This is a hard one, you
have a really nice one.

132
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,097
Take care of yourself.
- Alright.

133
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,225
Excuse me!

134
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,568
Hi, I am Sana!

135
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,303
Me too!

136
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,048
I mean you too! I mean...

137
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,514
I am Sheena's friend.

138
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:22,519
Sheena! Yes, of course!

139
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,783
You believe in fate, correct?

140
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:28,754
Well, we're meeting like
this, isn't this fate?

141
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,721
No!

142
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:32,788
It's not because of fate,
it's because of love.

143
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:37,395
Well, only fortunate ones find love!

144
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:41,002
Yes! But love can change fates too!

145
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,068
It doesn't destroy your fate!

146
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,005
For the sake of love, you
will have to win today! - Race.

147
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,139
Because if you lose.,
- No problem!

148
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,078
And what if I win?

149
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,755
Then we will celebrate
this victory together.

150
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:59,714
Promise!
- All the best.

151
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,556
Where were you?

152
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,689
We were searching all over for you!

153
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,233
I need a bike
- You want to race!

154
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,359
Yes!

155
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:10,493
You found him cute!

156
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,628
Why, are you feeling jealous?

157
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:14,639
No! But for the first time
you liked one of my boyfriends.

158
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:17,242
Either you have changed,
or my taste.

159
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,571
Your taste hasn't changed,
it has improved.

160
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,509
Well done Sheena, I am proud of you.

161
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,643
Who told you that
you can win this race?

162
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:26,776
Sana did.

163
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:28,179
Sana! - Really!

164
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:31,384
Who is Sana?
- Sheena's friend!

165
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,281
And who is Sheena?

166
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,758
'Back to the pit, big pretty... '

167
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,050
I don't know?

168
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:38,255
Hey, come on. Watch me.

169
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:40,996
Sunny will win.

170
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:50,300
Karan. Come on karan.

171
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:53,736
Karan.

172
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:10,688
Come on, come on you can do it.
- Yes. - Come on.

173
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,693
Karan.

174
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:50,301
Oh no
- Go. Go. Go. - Yes.

175
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:04,175
Come on. Yes. Yes.

176
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:23,064
Come on.
- Do it.

177
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:41,282
Yes.
- Come on.

178
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:47,016
Come on.

179
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:50,523
They are going towards the pitch.

180
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,196
Come on Sandy.

181
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,046
The one who has won is not Sandy...
- He is Sandy.

182
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,418
What's wrong with you?
- Sandy has lost, Sana.

183
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,525
Come let's go from here.

184
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,188
Hey Karan, cheer up dude. You won.

185
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:25,662
Yeah, I know but where is she?

186
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:27,756
There you go champ, you have won.

187
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,431
Now he is the champion,
he is become arrogant.

188
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,328
Karan! What are you looking for?

189
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:33,764
Don't ask what?

190
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,701
Ask, Karan whom are you looking for?

191
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:37,299
Sheena, it's just a race.

192
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,570
Someone wins and someone loses.

193
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,203
But Sandy wins this race every year.

194
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,974
For the last time,
it's not your fault!

195
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:43,106
Then whose fault is it?

196
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:44,574
I don't know!

197
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,982
Come on, let's go sit on
that roller coaster! - No, no!

198
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,179
...Come on!
- No, no!

199
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:49,712
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys!

200
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,214
I think that was Sana!

201
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,314
Sana!

202
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:53,483
Yes she is!

203
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:54,584
Listen, has he gone mad...

204
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:05,561
Where did he go?

205
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:09,734
What the hell are you doing here?

206
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:13,069
Of course not.

207
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,203
Have you gone mad?

208
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:17,140
Not until now.

209
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:18,513
But seems like your friend
is going to drive me crazy!

210
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,485
Anyway! Place and time!

211
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:22,745
Shit!

212
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:24,613
Operator, can you
get him off please!

213
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:26,318
I can't stop it before
it takes a full round.

214
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,127
Oh God! This is so embarrassing,
everyone is watching...

215
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,061
...can you please get off?
- Okay!

216
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,294
Oh my god. - Karan!

217
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:37,493
Come on!

218
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,628
All I am asking for is a date!

219
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:41,963
You had told me, if I
win we will celebrate.

220
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,674
All in the name of love.

221
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,237
You asked him to win
the race and not sandy!

222
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:47,470
What difference does it make?

223
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:49,104
If Sandy had to win the race,
then he would have won it!

224
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:52,207
How can Sandy win, when
my lady luck is with me?

225
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:53,442
Excuse me!

226
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,453
I am not your lady, and I
am definitely not your luck!

227
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,215
Of course, you are his lady luck.

228
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:58,984
That's why he win the race, and me...

229
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,285
...I am just unlucky!
Unlucky! Unlucky!

230
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:01,416
Sheena! Please behave yourself!

231
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:02,618
I am not talking to you!

232
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:04,094
I am not talking to you!
- Girls! Girls! Girls!

233
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,093
Calm down! I am hanging!

234
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:08,166
So Sana, where would you like to go?

235
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,300
Excuse me, I don't
go out with strangers!

236
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:11,661
Alright then!

237
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:13,398
Karan! Age 23! From Sydney!

238
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,507
Current status single, and waiting!

239
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,408
Say yes, Sana! He is so adorable.

240
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:20,536
Are you out of your mind?

241
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,607
Please say yes Sana, he will
fall down, die... turn into a ghost...

242
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:25,741
...and will come and scare us!

243
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:30,546
...Just say yes...
- Oh sorry.

244
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,147
Relax! Relax!

245
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:33,516
We will go out okay!

246
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:34,650
Don't worry about it!

247
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,024
We are on for a date!

248
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:38,287
So, when and where?

249
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,059
Shall I pick you up or
will you come by yourself?

250
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,325
First dinner or straight partying!

251
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,560
So, how would you like to
spend the evening with me Sana?

252
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:44,594
Not with you Mr. Karan!

253
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,570
Hey! Hey! Hey! That's not fair!

254
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,197
And what you did
with me, what was that?

255
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:50,031
You put me in an
embarrassing situation...

256
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:51,269
...and then blackmailed me!

257
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,668
All you get is a big no!

258
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,170
Listen...

259
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,641
Sheena!

260
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:00,176
We will meet again!

261
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,511
Definitely meet again.

262
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:06,190
She put your
entire heroism to shame!

263
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,287
Karan, that's the last samosa left!

264
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:10,520
Pick it up!

265
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:16,159
He doesn't want samosa, he
wants Sana! - He wants Sana! Okay...

266
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:19,069
It's not funny guys! I am stressing!

267
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,366
I can see her everywhere!

268
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,398
See that poster there!

269
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,666
That's Sana!

270
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,235
These girls that you can see!

271
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:26,736
Both of them are Sana!

272
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:28,473
What?
- These flowers...

273
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:31,274
I can see Sana in every petal.

274
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,708
God!

275
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:34,082
That bus that you see!

276
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:35,586
I can see Sana in that too!

277
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:37,053
God! Sana! Sana! Sana!

278
00:20:38,057 --> 00:20:39,149
All of you are laughing!

279
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:40,522
I am suffering! It's not funny!

280
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:44,027
Hey lover boy, Sana
really is in that bus.

281
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:45,154
What?

282
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,373
Oh no
- I am sorry, guys. - Idiot.

283
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:03,243
I am sorry. - Idiot sorry.
- Stop it, she is my car.

284
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:05,146
You are in a hurry to go somewhere.

285
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:09,051
Get you.

286
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:16,627
Stephen.
- Hang on.

287
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:20,591
Take him.

288
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:28,531
Come on. Come on.

289
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,588
Please guys, sorry.

290
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,518
Here I come Sana.

291
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,758
Yes.

292
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:25,387
Hello. Hello.

293
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,749
What are you doing here?

294
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,484
Sorry.

295
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,288
You, here...

296
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:33,724
I was following your bus.

297
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,500
Battling the traffic,
escaping the wrestlers.

298
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:39,060
From the port, to the top of the
bridge, and then on top of your bus.

299
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:40,196
And then, finally here
on top of your house.

300
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:44,008
I mean Outside! Inside! Whatever...

301
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:45,134
Okay! Okay! Okay!

302
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:47,576
What do you want?

303
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:51,507
Water!

304
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:55,144
Thank you!

305
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:02,326
Karan, what do you really want?

306
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,154
Karan!

307
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:08,027
I want you to fulfill your promise!

308
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,625
I won the race, for you!

309
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:12,127
I know!

310
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:13,262
But you shouldn't have won!

311
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:15,262
It was a mistake!
- Mistake!

312
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,668
You asked me to win,
that's why I won!

313
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:20,067
If you would have asked me to
lose, I would have easily lost.

314
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:23,041
But you asked me to win,
so what am I supposed to do?

315
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:24,173
I don't know!

316
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,307
I thought you were Sandy!

317
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:26,509
But you are not Sandy!

318
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:28,618
Hi, I am Sandy!

319
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,588
Kalidas has said,
what's in the name?

320
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,384
Not Kalidas, Shakespeare!

321
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,249
What's in the name Saba?

322
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,659
Not Saba, Sana!
- Exactly!

323
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:37,990
Listen!

324
00:24:38,997 --> 00:24:42,364
Since I've seen you, I can only see
in you in everything and everyone.

325
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:46,160
When I look into the mirror,
I see your face not mine!

326
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,072
Hello. Say something.

327
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:55,704
Karan! Are you free this evening?

328
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:57,379
I am free right now,
shall we go now?

329
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:01,143
Don't push your luck!

330
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:07,418
Yes. Yes.

331
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:08,652
Yes. Yes. She said yes.

332
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:11,195
Life is good. Life is great.
Life is good. Life is great.

333
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:14,232
Romeo and Juliet!

334
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,400
Romeo and Juliet!
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:18,764
Do you remember the balcony
scene in Romeo and Juliet?

336
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:22,497
Where Romeo risks his life
to give a rose to Juliet!

337
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,166
It's so romantic.

338
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:25,675
There should be
something special in the boy!

339
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,545
There is always something special in
every boy, isn't it Sana? - Karan!

340
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:32,245
I know what special quality
you Romeo should have? - What?

341
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:35,312
One, he should be smart and sexy!

342
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:39,122
Two, he should have muscles, or
else how will he climb the balcony?

343
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:40,483
He should be able to make you laugh!

344
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:44,990
And he should have a
lot of love for you!

345
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:46,121
Correct!

346
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:48,194
So basically I know
what you are looking for!

347
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:50,326
Me!

348
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:53,501
I am smart, I am definitely sexy.

349
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,106
I can make you laugh, I am strong.

350
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,403
There's a little
problem about love! .

351
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:00,444
But I'll come along.
- Stop it Karan!

352
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:01,570
Come on, it's the truth!

353
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,410
Stop it.
- This is the truth, you know it.

354
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:05,274
"Say the truth!"

355
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,078
"Say the truth!"

356
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:34,035
"Say the truth! Say, Say the truth!"

357
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,979
"Say the truth. Say the truth."

358
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:41,282
"Say the truth. Say the truth."

359
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:45,114
"Looking at me,
doesn't your heart say?"

360
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:49,190
"One that loves you and
always stays close to you!"

361
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:52,388
"Should be like me...
or should be it me!"

362
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,395
"Should be me, yes it should be me."

363
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,364
"Should be like me...
or should be it me!"

364
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,492
"Or should be it me."

365
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:03,732
"Say the truth!"

366
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:05,534
"Say the truth!"

367
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:09,377
"Whether you accept it or not!"

368
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:13,678
"You desire to find someone!"

369
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:21,115
"Whether you accept it or not!"

370
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:24,691
"You want someone to
be crazy for you!"

371
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,759
"One that sings only for you!"

372
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:28,590
"One who forgets
himself in your presence."

373
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,234
"One that only loves you!"

374
00:27:30,636 --> 00:27:32,297
"Only you."

375
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,334
"One that only looks at you."

376
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:36,497
"Only you."

377
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:38,202
"Say the truth!"
- "Say the truth!"

378
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:40,210
"Say the truth!"
- "Say the truth!"

379
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:43,975
"Say the truth!"
- "Say the truth!"

380
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:47,576
"Looking at me,
doesn't your heart say?"

381
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:51,682
"The one that loves you,
always stays close to you!"

382
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,016
"Should be like me...
or should it be me!"

383
00:27:55,193 --> 00:27:56,990
"It Should be me,
yes it should be me!"

384
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,653
"It should be me,
yes it should be me!"

385
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:02,700
"It should be me,
yes it should be me!"

386
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:10,534
"Say the truth!"

387
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,543
"Say the truth!"

388
00:28:28,326 --> 00:28:30,385
Karan, what are you doing
here so early in the morning?

389
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:31,587
Waiting for sunshine!

390
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,497
But it was dawn a long time back!

391
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:34,723
It is just now.

392
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:39,230
What do you want now Karan?

393
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:43,972
Nothing! I just, came
to give you this flower!

394
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:48,144
You didn't come so far, so early
in the morning, to give me a flower.

395
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:50,142
So you might as well
tell me what you want.

396
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,645
One more day,
please! Just one more day.

397
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,050
Karan, I can't!

398
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,111
Please, I promise I
won't disturb you at all!

399
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:59,116
I will just look at you from far!

400
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:00,515
No! Now go!

401
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,387
Come on Sana, say yes sometimes.

402
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:04,993
It is such a simple word!
It is such a nice word!

403
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:06,325
Y E S, yes!

404
00:29:06,498 --> 00:29:07,658
Is your name Sana? Yes!

405
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:09,098
Do you live here? Yes!

406
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:10,998
Will you go out with Karan? Yes!

407
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:12,434
Are you leaving?
- Yes!

408
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:13,729
No! No! No! No!

409
00:29:15,006 --> 00:29:16,667
Come on, please say yes.

410
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,440
Karan, you and I don't
have anything in common.

411
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,034
We are completely different.

412
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:22,004
Rubbish! We are just the same.

413
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,741
Two arms, two ears,
two eyes, one nose.

414
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:26,049
Now, even my face
resembles you slightly.

415
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,177
You won't give up!

416
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:34,125
Is that a yes?
- Yes!

417
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:37,353
Yes. Yes. Yes.

418
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:41,559
She said yes again.
- You are my lucky charm.

419
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:45,229
I love hot dogs.

420
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:49,533
Not like you, I mean,
like true love.

421
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:51,037
If hot dog would have been a bitch...

422
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:52,371
...I would have been married by now.

423
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:54,275
I can see, true love.

424
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:56,773
You know what I feel.

425
00:29:57,315 --> 00:29:58,441
Your life is...

426
00:29:59,317 --> 00:30:01,182
Is like a hotdog without a sausage.

427
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:04,048
I am sure you haven't done
anything exciting in your life.

428
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,181
Of course I have.

429
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:06,681
Like what?

430
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:09,625
Like painting, like poetry,
like gardening.

431
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:11,791
I said something exciting!

432
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:14,054
Painting, poetry, blah-blah!

433
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:15,190
What do you mean then?

434
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,734
I mean, today you
should do something...

435
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,326
...that you have never done
ever before in your life.

436
00:30:18,403 --> 00:30:19,563
Right here, right now.

437
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:23,199
Something crazy, something
wild, something, naughty.

438
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,800
Excuse me! - No, no, no I
don't mean that naughty.

439
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:28,677
Well like, a little naughty,
I mean something crazy!

440
00:30:28,747 --> 00:30:32,274
Like, robbery!
- Robbery!

441
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:35,344
You mean stealing!
- No, I mean eating.

442
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,614
Obviously!

443
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:39,454
I am not asking you to rob a bank.

444
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:43,252
Something small, so
like something very small.

445
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,489
Like a mini-skirt, like that one.
- Are you crazy?

446
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:47,698
Come on, it's just for fun!

447
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,097
What difference will
it make to anyone here?

448
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,503
Look, I have never done
anything like this before...

449
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,129
That's why it's important to do it.

450
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:56,571
Otherwise, accept it. All your
life you will live like this.

451
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,441
Like this hotdog without sausage.

452
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,704
Are you trying to challenge me?

453
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:01,040
Nope!

454
00:31:01,112 --> 00:31:02,443
Actually yeah,
because you can't do it!

455
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:03,705
Sana can't do it!

456
00:31:03,782 --> 00:31:05,249
There is no way in the world
that you can do it! - Stop it!

457
00:31:05,317 --> 00:31:06,375
You don't have a chance.
- Stop it!

458
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:07,509
You don't have a scope.

459
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:08,644
Stop it Karan, I will do it fine.

460
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,244
You will do it!
- Yes.

461
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:12,586
Excellent! Great, done!

462
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,049
Which shop, take your pick.

463
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:18,320
Come on.

464
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:19,721
That one.

465
00:31:23,168 --> 00:31:24,692
What's up!
- Hi!

466
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,066
Come on Sana, you can do it.

467
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:37,673
Excuse me!

468
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,307
How much is that for?

469
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:41,284
The price is written on it!
- Excellent!

470
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:06,207
Karan! I stole it! I stole it!

471
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:08,238
Why are you getting so excited?

472
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:11,111
You didn't win the Olympics.
It's just stealing!

473
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:12,706
Yeah, but look he is so cute!

474
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:15,150
Winkydinks says hi
to Karan! Hi Karan!

475
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,586
Hi Winkydinks!

476
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:18,680
Yes, nice name isn't it?

477
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,156
Winkydinks, do you
want to kiss Karan? Yes!

478
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:24,686
How sweet!

479
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:27,095
Winkydinks, time to go home.

480
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:28,655
Why but, no! Karan! Karan, no!

481
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:31,225
Sana, it's stolen,
we have to return it!

482
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:33,066
Yes! But Winkydinks
doesn't want to go home.

483
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:34,730
Winkydinks, do you
want to go back home?

484
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:37,070
No ma'am, see so sad.

485
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:39,067
How sad!

486
00:32:39,144 --> 00:32:40,202
Hey you! Stop there!

487
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:41,336
Oh damn!
- Bye!

488
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:43,244
Bloody shoplifters!

489
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:47,650
Okay, now it's your turn.

490
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,744
My turn! What turn! U-turn!

491
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:53,115
Karan! To do something
you have never done before.

492
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:56,287
Well come to think of it,
I have done everything.

493
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:57,692
I have done it all.

494
00:32:57,762 --> 00:32:59,093
Okay, what about poetry.

495
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,033
Poetry! Please Sana!

496
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,568
Come on, it's lot of fun
and it's really easy. - No!

497
00:33:04,636 --> 00:33:05,694
For example.

498
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:10,098
You say, there is mischief,
there is love in your eyes.

499
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:14,475
And, I'll say, there is allurement,
there is acceptance in your eyes.

500
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:17,777
I will live in your eyes,
what's the big deal!

501
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:19,274
Poetry is useless.

502
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:23,779
One second!

503
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:28,751
Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, can
you please come closer, come closer.

504
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,186
Not you!

505
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:31,720
Why?

506
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:33,354
People, listen to me.

507
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:36,062
This gentlemen here, is going to
recite some meaningful poetry...

508
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,537
Karan Malhotra, age 23 from Sydney.

509
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:44,666
Current state is single
and finally fluttering.

510
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:49,012
I can't do this. Have
you lost your marbles?

511
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,312
"Why has the
ambience changed suddenly?"

512
00:33:54,252 --> 00:33:55,310
This is so unfair!

513
00:33:55,387 --> 00:33:57,355
I am going to Winkydinks.
- Karan, it's really easy!

514
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:58,446
No Sana!
- Come on. - No.

515
00:33:59,024 --> 00:34:03,256
"Why has the weather
changed so suddenly?"

516
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:20,707
"Why has the weather
changed so suddenly?"

517
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:25,779
"It's the nature of life,
what else do I say?"

518
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:30,781
"This breeze, what
does it say to you?"

519
00:34:31,056 --> 00:34:36,153
"It says, you continue to sing."

520
00:34:36,227 --> 00:34:41,028
"Where does road take us?"

521
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,397
"Come, let us see."

522
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:50,668
"Do these flowers
always smell so good?"

523
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:55,741
"They have a good heart,
what else do they say?"

524
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:05,751
"Why has the weather
changed so suddenly?"

525
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:11,154
"It's the nature of life,
what else do I say?"

526
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,043
"Since the past few days, I feel."

527
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:41,219
"This world... is
such a beautiful place."

528
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:46,494
"If there is a heaven,
it's right here."

529
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:50,557
"Why? Why do I feel that?"

530
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:56,337
"When life is
filled with happiness."

531
00:35:57,108 --> 00:36:01,408
"When every moment is joyful."

532
00:36:02,013 --> 00:36:06,416
"Then everything looks lovely."

533
00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:10,443
"It may be a sign of love."

534
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:16,026
"Why are the petals so delicate?"

535
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:21,192
"They are shy, and what do I say."

536
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:01,197
"The birds on the trees,
what are the lyrics?"

537
00:37:02,173 --> 00:37:06,200
"They are repeating."

538
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:11,505
"It seems they are
trying to tell us something."

539
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:15,280
"Why do I feel so?"

540
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:21,617
"The birds singing all they know."

541
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,759
"The true meaning of
living life is to fly high."

542
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:31,568
"They want us to
believe in this too."

543
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:35,436
"That's how it is."

544
00:37:36,574 --> 00:37:41,011
"Why is this ray of
light so goldenish?"

545
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:46,041
"It's becoming evening,
what else do I say?"

546
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,421
I love the rain!

547
00:37:57,996 --> 00:37:59,987
The rain is so romantic,
isn't it? - Yup!

548
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,999
You know what's the
best part of rain? - What?

549
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,125
Mud!

550
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,996
When someone steps in the
puddle and gets splattered...

551
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,503
...it's so fun to watch it.

552
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:08,663
Like when we play football.

553
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,174
One kick after another,
and another, and another.

554
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:14,734
If you come out of the mud, you
will realize how romantic rains are.

555
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,547
Karan! Karan!

556
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:21,174
Karan! Stop it, come here!

557
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:25,215
Tell me Karan, you know
almost everything about me!

558
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,056
Won't you tell me
anything about yourself?

559
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,025
Karan Malhotra, Age 23, from Sydney!

560
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:32,255
Current status single and
splattering! Splattering!

561
00:38:32,463 --> 00:38:33,589
Seriously!

562
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,694
About yourself! About your family!

563
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:41,335
Mummy used to love me a lot.

564
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:45,635
I felt as if, she showered
all her love in 10 years.

565
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:48,407
My dad, he is great.

566
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,704
But God has been
very unjust with him!

567
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:55,208
He gave such a big man only 24
hours, like any other ordinary man.

568
00:38:55,286 --> 00:38:56,310
But he manages.

569
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,022
At least, he does
manage his business.

570
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:01,483
And the only one left is me.

571
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,526
I have all the time, all
the time in the world.

572
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:05,027
Fast cars, bikes, sports.

573
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,154
Anything with an edge.

574
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,720
The more dangerous
it is, the better.

575
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,263
Why do you like danger Karan?

576
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:17,599
Maybe I want to see, the
limits I can push myself too.

577
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:22,270
And if someday I do stray far away.

578
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,141
No one will miss me.

579
00:39:30,555 --> 00:39:33,023
So, will I have to
show you another movie.

580
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:35,321
...or will you spare me for a day?

581
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:39,552
No Karan! I am going
back home tomorrow.

582
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,030
I came here to study.

583
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,760
And it has been 3 days
since my holidays started.

584
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,765
Everyone is waiting for me at home.

585
00:39:48,606 --> 00:39:52,042
I had forgotten, you
have a real family.

586
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:56,309
My train will leave at 10 o'clock
tomorrow from Central Station!

587
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,310
If you want...
- No Sana!

588
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:00,777
I won't come see you off!

589
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:04,279
I hate goodbyes.

590
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:09,755
Won't you even ask, when
will I return? Where I am going?

591
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:13,058
What's the use?

592
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:14,792
I'm going back to Sydney too!

593
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,064
But there's no one waiting for me.

594
00:40:18,736 --> 00:40:20,067
But I will return next year.

595
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:22,072
And I am sure that a
boring girl like you...

596
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,801
...won't have a boyfriend even then.

597
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:28,669
Oh! I have got you something!

598
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:30,472
Winkydinks.

599
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:33,549
I didn't steal it!
I have bought them!

600
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:37,113
Because we can't
live without you, ma'am.

601
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:39,547
Thanks!

602
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,630
Either my luck is bad,
or your timing!

603
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,100
Bye Karan!

604
00:41:17,395 --> 00:41:18,623
Take care of yourself Karan!

605
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:28,335
Don't go too far, because
there's someone who'll miss you.

606
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,300
Will miss you a lot!

607
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:36,074
Bye.

608
00:41:52,263 --> 00:41:54,026
God knows, why hasn't
Karan arrived till now?

609
00:41:54,098 --> 00:41:55,156
We will miss our flight!

610
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:56,757
Hey Karan! Where are you?

611
00:41:58,269 --> 00:41:59,327
You aren't coming, what?

612
00:42:00,538 --> 00:42:01,596
I am going to the railway station!

613
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:03,765
The flight takes off from the
airport not the railway station!

614
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,500
I know!

615
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:07,769
I am going to stop Sana!

616
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:15,576
So you are in love!
- Yes, yes I am!

617
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:16,677
So, we will stay back too.

618
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:18,186
We will leave only
after getting you married.

619
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:20,257
And I will dance.
- Shut up!

620
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:29,462
So much traffic. I am late.
It's already 10 o'clock.

621
00:42:29,534 --> 00:42:31,399
Can you tell me what the fare is?
- It's 50 dollars.

622
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:32,731
Hey, hey best of luck.

623
00:42:33,738 --> 00:42:35,672
I don't need luck I have love.

624
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:40,735
'Don't be a fool, Sana! '

625
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:43,605
'He won't come! '

626
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:52,421
Ma'am board in. It's time to leave.

627
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:07,195
Hang on.

628
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:33,319
"The Heart cannot endure the
separation... even for a moment."

629
00:43:33,397 --> 00:43:43,500
"Still I don't know why...
I couldn't express it."

630
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:49,604
"You are my destiny!"

631
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,413
"Our love story is so strange!"

632
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:57,618
"Like the dreams..."

633
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:59,122
Excuse me.
- Yes.

634
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:02,617
The train from platform
number 6, where does it go.

635
00:44:03,194 --> 00:44:05,560
Over there. All of the four
stations on the monitor there.

636
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:09,657
Thanks.
- Fine.

637
00:44:45,202 --> 00:44:47,500
Strath Alybyn! Here I come.

638
00:44:50,741 --> 00:44:53,107
Hello. Ms. Alba. Karan.

639
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,336
Karan. How are you?

640
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:57,040
I am doing well.
How's dad? Is he around?

641
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,082
No, he is in a meeting.

642
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,483
Great. Tell dad I will
spend time with uncle Ya.

643
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,044
Uncle Ya!

644
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:07,522
Uncle Ya, Ms. Alba. My uncle.
The greatest scientist in the world.

645
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:18,760
Uncle Ya.

646
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:20,094
So what brings you here?

647
00:45:21,038 --> 00:45:24,235
Uncle, I just felt like
meeting you so I came here.

648
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,434
What is her name?

649
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:28,669
Whose?

650
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:31,544
Look, your uncle can read
the movement of the planets.

651
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:33,414
Reading your face is not big deal?

652
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,615
Who is it? Who has
formatted your hard disk...

653
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,712
...and put a virus in it.

654
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:42,989
Sana!

655
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,254
And where is Sana?

656
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,057
What is her address?
- I don't know?

657
00:45:46,497 --> 00:45:48,192
I mean... maybe she must
be around here somewhere?

658
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:49,493
Maybe! What do you mean by maybe?

659
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:51,994
Someone told me?
- Who?

660
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:55,600
A butterfly!

661
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:57,231
Butterfly...

662
00:45:58,242 --> 00:46:00,335
You are in love,
baby! You are in love.

663
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:19,621
'I feel that I have lost something! '

664
00:46:24,168 --> 00:46:28,764
'You know diary, Winky dinks says
that Karan had come to the station. '

665
00:46:30,107 --> 00:46:32,234
'Winky dinks is crazy. Isn't it? '

666
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,041
'But why doesn't my heart agree? '

667
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,977
'It absolutely stupid...
like Winky dinks...

668
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:41,142
...like Karan... like everyone. '

669
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:42,276
'Everyone is crazy. '

670
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:45,182
'Or am I the one that's gone crazy. '

671
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,482
'I am the one that's crazy. '

672
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:51,117
'Lost the most
beautiful thing in the world. '

673
00:46:52,263 --> 00:46:53,628
'Lf you would have
been here with me. '

674
00:46:56,267 --> 00:46:57,529
'You wouldn't have let this happen. '

675
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:01,096
'Just once! I want to
see him just once more! '

676
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:02,631
'Just once. '

677
00:47:03,507 --> 00:47:05,407
'Then I will never let
her go away from me. '

678
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:09,067
'I will just ask,
Karan are you fine? '

679
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:10,738
'Do you miss me?

680
00:47:11,315 --> 00:47:13,681
'Do you get sleep at
night? ' 'Do you feel hungry? '

681
00:47:15,352 --> 00:47:16,649
'Will you have a hotdog, Karan? '

682
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:19,046
'I miss you. '

683
00:47:19,723 --> 00:47:21,020
Will you have some coffee?

684
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:22,423
Okay, let me make you some coffee.

685
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:26,361
You know, when I returned from
NASA, people thought I am insane.

686
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,692
Except for your dad.

687
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:29,756
He was the only guy
who didn't laugh at me.

688
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:31,592
Sugar!

689
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:33,765
One teaspoon.
- Yeah, one.

690
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:35,263
Okay.

691
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:37,466
You know, he
helped me with this lab.

692
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:38,599
He helped me with this lab.

693
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:40,974
Although he didn't
know what I was making.

694
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:47,379
You really don't know
what you are making.

695
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:50,413
Coffee, finally!

696
00:47:52,323 --> 00:47:54,086
Sometimes a man gets stuck.

697
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,388
On the coffee?
- No!

698
00:47:57,061 --> 00:47:58,551
On the machine.
- Machine!

699
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:02,993
For the past 15 years, I have
been working on a machine Karan.

700
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:05,661
A time machine!

701
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:06,998
A time machine!

702
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:10,000
I know what you are thinking.

703
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:12,008
A man who can't even
make two cups of coffee...

704
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:14,101
...how can he ever
make a time machine.

705
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:17,739
But a time machine can be made.
We can travel into the future.

706
00:48:18,182 --> 00:48:19,240
Are you serious uncle?

707
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,613
I am so close Karan.

708
00:48:20,684 --> 00:48:21,742
I am this close.

709
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,151
All I need is a little bit of luck.

710
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:26,046
Luck!

711
00:48:26,257 --> 00:48:28,225
Good luck uncle, good luck.

712
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:31,385
Love you. Love you.

713
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:33,087
Good luck to you too.

714
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:36,962
I don't need luck. I have love.

715
00:49:17,074 --> 00:49:18,735
'The rain is so romantic, isn't it? '

716
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:20,067
'I love the rain. '

717
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,241
'You know what the best
part of rain is? - What? '

718
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:24,372
'Mud! '

719
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:27,008
'When someone steps in the
puddle and gets splattered. '

720
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:51,295
"We were miles apart."

721
00:50:51,535 --> 00:50:56,529
"The journey would take centuries."

722
00:50:57,041 --> 00:51:01,774
"The heart was unaware."

723
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:12,687
"But I still felt... we
were destined to meet."

724
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:17,787
"We were miles apart."

725
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:23,464
"The journey would take centuries."

726
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:29,071
"The heart was unaware."

727
00:51:29,406 --> 00:51:39,611
"But I still felt... we
were destined to meet."

728
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:45,314
"We were miles apart."

729
00:52:06,477 --> 00:52:16,648
"My passion has brought me so far."

730
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:27,595
"My dreams have come true."

731
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:34,068
"Don't love me so much,
don't cherish me so much."

732
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:38,734
"What if we separate tomorrow?"

733
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:45,014
"Never... say that again."

734
00:52:45,082 --> 00:52:49,212
"Never go away from me again."

735
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:55,614
"We were miles apart."

736
00:52:56,226 --> 00:53:01,357
"The journey would take centuries."

737
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:06,494
"The heart was unaware."

738
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:17,377
"But I still felt we
were destined to meet!"

739
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:23,777
"We were miles apart!"

740
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,518
So friends.

741
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:35,793
Mrs. Bedi, you are amazing.

742
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:37,727
Always. Always. Always.

743
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,229
Very good. Too much. Isn't it?

744
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:40,361
What's the matter?

745
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:42,200
You are slimming down these days.

746
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:45,006
What can I do Mrs. Kapoor,
I am worried about my daughter...

747
00:53:45,075 --> 00:53:47,168
...I can't find a
suitable boy for him.

748
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:48,302
Yes.

749
00:53:48,378 --> 00:53:49,504
But Mrs. Bhalla was saying that...

750
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,013
you have already
selected a boy for Sana.

751
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:52,673
Mrs. Bhalla...

752
00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:54,512
She can select any stupid, fool.

753
00:53:56,653 --> 00:54:00,020
But don't you think, Sana
has become a bit too choosy.

754
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:04,593
It's also possible, that Sana
doesn't have any interest in boys.

755
00:54:05,295 --> 00:54:06,353
Who knows what?

756
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,088
Oh God!

757
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:11,691
Mrs. Chaddha, what have you done?

758
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:14,362
Oh God, please send a
boy that Sana will like.

759
00:54:14,438 --> 00:54:15,564
However, stout, short!

760
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:18,267
Then If I ever ask for anything
ever again, then you can slap me.

761
00:54:29,553 --> 00:54:33,148
Lord, You are very fast and furious.

762
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,158
I made a request, you've
already sent me a boy.

763
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:36,487
You are like me only.

764
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,720
Very good. Too much.

765
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,165
Where did the boy go?
- Karan, here.

766
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:47,328
Whatever you say.
- It's more private.

767
00:54:47,738 --> 00:54:49,000
After you.

768
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:52,737
So, you and me... what next?

769
00:54:58,482 --> 00:54:59,744
So cute.

770
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:02,016
Karan, let go off my hand... this is
my neighbor's hotel...

771
00:55:02,085 --> 00:55:03,746
No one will see us.
- Sana.

772
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:06,222
So fast and furious, Lord.

773
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:07,415
Sana, I know what you are thinking?

774
00:55:07,524 --> 00:55:09,719
Karan, come closer.
Quench my thirst.

775
00:55:10,027 --> 00:55:11,358
Karan. Stop it! Stop it, Karan!

776
00:55:11,428 --> 00:55:13,020
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop.

777
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:14,621
Douse his craving.

778
00:55:14,698 --> 00:55:15,756
He is right.

779
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:17,091
Mom. Mom.

780
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,135

Mom! Not in me, on me.

He will write it in my account,
so it will be in me.

00:55:35,552 --> 00:55:37,281

Come home on dinner.

Rahul, did you hear?

What happened?
- Nothing, auntie.

827
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:38,699
It's just water.

828
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:42,072
Did it rain only on one leg?

829
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,338
Come on. Come in.

830
00:57:43,513 --> 00:57:47,472
Tell me the truth, were you
feeling nervous while coming here?

831
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:50,018
No auntie, how can I be scared
coming here when you are there.

832
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,314
How cute?

833
00:57:51,421 --> 00:57:52,615
Take a seat, son.

Children say, that's the
lucky seat. Sit there.

836
00:57:58,662 --> 00:57:59,720

837
00:58:01,531 --> 00:58:02,589

This is Rahul and Thia.

843
00:58:13,677 --> 00:58:16,305
Darling, where are you going?

844
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,471
Karan, mom!

845
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:18,639
Sana, Karan!

846
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:20,107
Got you.

847
00:58:20,383 --> 00:58:22,442
Got you. Got you.

848
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:24,111
Rahul! Thia! What are you doing?

849
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,245
Give the camera to me.

850
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:26,614
Say sorry to Karan bhaiyya.

851
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:28,450
I should be the one saying sorry.

852
00:58:30,627 --> 00:58:31,685
I'll speak to them.

853
00:58:33,363 --> 00:58:34,421
I am sorry.

854
00:58:36,066 --> 00:58:38,694
I am sorry that I am taking
your sister Sana away from you.

855
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:40,427
But what can I do?

856
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:42,061
Your sister Sana is so adorable.

857
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,170
And there is no one to love me.

858
00:58:45,642 --> 00:58:47,576
That's why God has sent
your sister Sana to me.

859
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:48,702
So that she can
shower her love on me.

860
00:58:49,513 --> 00:58:51,344
Now, I cannot give
you anything in return.

861
00:58:52,048 --> 00:58:53,709
But, I can promise
you guys one thing.

862
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:56,717
I will love you more
than your sister Sana.

863
00:58:57,521 --> 00:58:58,613
Deal!

864
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:00,513
Deal!

865
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:01,682
Come on, deal!

866
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:03,583
So Karan, what are your hobbies?

867
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:05,452
I have a lot of hobbies uncle.

868
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:09,725
Like X-treme sports, mountain
biking, tap dancing, hip-hop.

869
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,731
Don't you have a serious hobby?

870
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:14,198
How can a hobby be serious?

871
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:18,739
I mean, I do
everything seriously sir.

872
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:22,403
In fact, I have won the FIFA
world cup three times, on the Xbox.

Yes!

In Mortal Kombat, at every level I
have broken every fighter's bones.

875

Do you have any
constructive hobby or

The one in which the hero
climbs the... the balcony...

887
01:00:01,084 --> 01:00:02,415
Polio and... Romeo and Juliet!

888
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,577
Exactly!

889
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:04,745
Sana's favorite play too.

890
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:07,056
If you have finished asking
him about old and boring books...

891
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,250
...then can I match their horoscopes.

892
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:10,484
Son, what is your
date of birth and time.

893
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:13,526
13th November, 1984.

894
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:16,622
8: 25 in the evening,
131 Baker Street...

895
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,600
Not the address, I don't
want to write a letter.

896
01:00:19,469 --> 01:00:21,699
I will send the
details to Bhatinda tomorrow.

897
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:23,470
The priest will match
both the horoscopes.

898
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,598
By the way, aunt.

899
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,175
My uncle sees horoscopes too. Yes.

900
01:00:26,276 --> 01:00:27,800
I mean, he is not a
professional astrologer.

901
01:00:28,144 --> 01:00:30,112
But astrology is his serious hobby.

902
01:00:30,213 --> 01:00:31,510
Very good, too much.

903
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,310
My courier money is saved too.

904
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,747
Son, give me your uncle's address.

905
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:37,252
Tell me.
- Mom, let Karan eat peacefully.

906
01:00:37,354 --> 01:00:38,412
I didn't stop him from eating?

907
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:39,715
Tell me as you are eating.

908
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:47,223
Very good, too much.

909
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:50,230
Quickly place all the planets
in their houses and tell me...

910
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:52,600
Relax Mrs. Bedi, please relax.

911
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:54,670
If the constellations get mixed
up, everything will be ruined.

912
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:57,399
Nothing should go wrong.

913
01:00:57,674 --> 01:00:59,335
It is the question of
the children's life.

914
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:03,069
Oh, Saba. Saba.
- Wow!

915
01:01:13,056 --> 01:01:14,080
Karan!

916
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:17,355
It's just a lab. Come.

917
01:01:29,472 --> 01:01:33,568
Khanna sir, you are a scientist
still you know all this. How?

918
01:01:33,677 --> 01:01:35,611
I know, and I believe in it too.

919
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:38,007
The movement of the planet makes a
difference in the lives of human's.

920
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:40,542
It contains the rewards for
the deeds. Reincarnation too.

921
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:43,316
Oh God! Reinc...

922
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:49,219
That's why Khanna sir, whenever
I see high walls I feel giddy.

923
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,017
How many times have I
thought... that in my...

924
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:53,756
...past birth I must
surely been Anarkali.

925
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:57,025
Yeah, of course. You
must have been Anarkali.

926
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,664
If you would have been Anarkali,
then I must have been Saleem.

927
01:02:01,705 --> 01:02:02,763
Oh!
- Wow!

928
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:10,177
All that's fine, but,,
what's the big secret?

929
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:11,571
Secret!

930
01:02:12,082 --> 01:02:15,051
There is a time machine here.

931
01:02:16,386 --> 01:02:17,444
What?

932
01:02:17,554 --> 01:02:18,578
Don't you know what
a time machine is?

933
01:02:19,055 --> 01:02:20,750
In which you can
travel through time.

934
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:26,686
A time machine... using
which we can go into any era.

935
01:02:27,097 --> 01:02:28,291
We can go anywhere.

936
01:02:28,465 --> 01:02:30,365
In the past, in the future.

937
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,128
I know that.

938
01:02:32,235 --> 01:02:33,793
But is it for real?
Of course it's real.

939
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:36,297
Uncle Ya is the coolest
scientist in the world.

940
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:39,737
15 years back he left NASA...
so that he can come here.

941
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,178
So that he can do
research on the time machine.

942
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:43,403
He can construct it.

943
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:45,003
There is nothing
interesting in my hand...

944
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:46,514
...you are just staring at my face.

945
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:50,550
Remember. Try to remember the
time, when you were Anarkali...

946
01:02:50,653 --> 01:02:53,315
And you were Saleem.
Forget it Khanna sir.

947
01:02:53,423 --> 01:02:54,515
I am too clever.

948
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:58,391
Even if I was Anarkali... how
could you have recognized me now.

949
01:02:58,495 --> 01:03:01,123
Wouldn't my face look different now?

950
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:02,323
No! No! No!

951
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:05,031
Whenever a person
lives his life peacefully...

952
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:09,128
...and dies, then in the next
birth he assumes a new form.

953
01:03:09,773 --> 01:03:13,470
But... if he dies
before time... like Anarkali.

954
01:03:14,444 --> 01:03:17,242
Then he assumes the same form
as he did in his last birth.

955
01:03:17,614 --> 01:03:19,343
Anarkali!

956
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:22,207
You are scaring me.

957
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:25,149
Karan! Will you show it to me once?

958
01:03:26,456 --> 01:03:27,480
What?

959
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,648
Time machine Karan.

960
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:30,055
No, no, no you can't be,, no.
- Please, please, please...

961
01:03:30,126 --> 01:03:32,617
...No, no way. - Please Karan,
I will do whatever you say.

962
01:03:34,063 --> 01:03:35,121
Anything I say.

963
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:38,997
Open sesame. Stop!

964
01:03:39,502 --> 01:03:40,730
You cheat.

965
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,373
Oh my god, Karan! What will
uncle say if he sees this?

966
01:03:47,477 --> 01:03:49,138
Oh no. What have I done?

967
01:03:49,379 --> 01:03:51,040
Uncle won't remember anything.

968
01:03:52,215 --> 01:03:53,580
I remember.
- What?

969
01:03:55,084 --> 01:04:00,647
You are too sexy.

970
01:04:01,024 --> 01:04:02,423
Oh! This wasn't written here.

971
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:05,121
I can't remember it.

972
01:04:05,395 --> 01:04:08,228
You are thinking as if
you used to tutor Einstein.

973
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:09,589
Come on.

974
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:25,573
What's the matter
astrologer cum scientist, you are...

975
01:04:25,648 --> 01:04:26,706
Is there any problem?

976
01:04:27,517 --> 01:04:28,677
No! Sana has a very nice horoscope.

977
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:31,151
My child is so nice.

978
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:33,154
Her constellations will be the best.

979
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:34,754
Match the horoscope with Karan's.

980
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:36,647
I will do it in a day or two.

981
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:39,058
Shall I leave the horoscope here?
Yes, leave it back here.

982
01:04:39,395 --> 01:04:40,555
Leave Sana back here too.

983
01:04:41,164 --> 01:04:42,290
Karan will drop her.

984
01:04:42,398 --> 01:04:44,195
Goodbye, good luck.

985
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:47,735
"He came to match the horoscope.
To get them married."

986
01:05:05,021 --> 01:05:07,615
I never tell lies. Trust me.

987
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,328
This machine really works, Sana.

988
01:05:35,685 --> 01:05:36,674
Oh my God!

989
01:05:42,392 --> 01:05:43,586
That is so unreal.

990
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:50,357
Does it work.

991
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:51,524
I don't know.

992
01:05:51,634 --> 01:05:53,465
Depends. On what?

993
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,732
It does work?

994
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:01,733
Welcome to the time machine.

995
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:03,069
I am nervous.
- Don't be.

996
01:06:03,246 --> 01:06:06,443
After you sunshine.

997
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:10,610
Wow!

998
01:06:10,653 --> 01:06:12,553
How does it start?

999
01:06:13,022 --> 01:06:14,046
Can you press that button?

1000
01:06:15,525 --> 01:06:16,617
Sorry.

1001
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,418
Start!

1002
01:06:20,163 --> 01:06:22,063
So sunshine, what time, what place?

1003
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:24,195
Mumbai. Where I was born!

1004
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:25,525
Mumbai! 1986!

1005
01:06:25,635 --> 01:06:26,693
Excellent choice.

1006
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:29,465
Finally I will be
able to see you naked.

1007
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:30,630
High... hopes!

1008
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,267
We have already seen the past.
Now we will see the future.

1009
01:06:34,544 --> 01:06:36,341
We will see whether the
world has changed or not?

1010
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,038
Type it!

1011
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:44,214
M U M B A I! Mumbai!

1012
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,014
What happened?

1013
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,451
I am scared.

1014
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:52,052
Trust me Sana.

1015
01:06:52,328 --> 01:06:53,386
Nothing will happen.

1016
01:06:53,496 --> 01:06:54,588
There is nothing to be scared of.

1017
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:56,293
Mumbai, and the year.

1018
01:06:56,399 --> 01:06:57,491
Type the year.

1019
01:06:59,068 --> 01:07:03,198
20... I am feeling
very strange Karan.

1020
01:07:03,339 --> 01:07:04,397
Give me your hand.

1021
01:07:05,008 --> 01:07:06,066
Close your eyes.

1022
01:07:06,376 --> 01:07:08,207
I promise. I won't do anything.

1023
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:13,106
Type wherever you feel like.

1024
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,244
What did I type?

1025
01:07:19,355 --> 01:07:20,720
Mumbai 2050!

1026
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:25,218
2050!
- Yes.

1027
01:07:26,029 --> 01:07:27,690
So want to go to Mumbai 2050.

1028
01:07:29,532 --> 01:07:32,467
Yeah! I guess.

1029
01:07:32,568 --> 01:07:33,626
Should I lock it?

1030
01:07:35,038 --> 01:07:36,232
Let's go to 2050.

1031
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:45,170
Oh!

1032
01:07:46,015 --> 01:07:47,983
What's happening, Karan?

1033
01:07:48,084 --> 01:07:50,018
This actually works. It works!

1034
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:52,978
What do you mean it works,
you said it works.

1035
01:07:53,423 --> 01:07:55,482
I just said it, for the kiss.

1036
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,718
Uncle Ya!

1037
01:07:59,095 --> 01:08:00,392
Have we reached the future?

1038
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:01,622
Am I still handsome?

1039
01:08:02,031 --> 01:08:03,362
Welcome to the future, uncle?

1040
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,089
Get out.

1041
01:08:06,536 --> 01:08:09,027
We are still in 2008.

1042
01:08:09,338 --> 01:08:10,600
No uncle. I don't know why
I gave you all the access codes...

1043
01:08:10,673 --> 01:08:12,106
...to the time machine.

1044
01:08:13,342 --> 01:08:14,400
Get out of my lab.

1045
01:08:14,544 --> 01:08:16,102
Uncle Ya, you should be happy.

1046
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:18,313
The time machine worked,
you are a genius.

1047
01:08:18,414 --> 01:08:20,439
The time machine has not worked.

1048
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,746
For the last time,
we are still in 2008.

1049
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,319
Uncle Ya, the light,
the smoke... the machine.

1050
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:30,585
You have short circuited the machine,
that's why all the smoke here.

1051
01:08:30,693 --> 01:08:32,456
And the sound is of
the exhaust machine.

1052
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,155
Get out or I will give you one.

1053
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:35,488
Out!

1054
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:39,533
Uncle. It's not Karan's fault,
it's entirely my fault.

1055
01:08:39,602 --> 01:08:43,060
I had asked him... I am really
sorry. I am sorry. - It is my fault.

1056
01:08:43,473 --> 01:08:45,065
I vented my anger on someone else.

1057
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:48,069
What kind of anger?
- No. No. No.

1058
01:08:49,545 --> 01:08:51,604
Tell that fool, that I
am not angry with him.

1059
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:54,411
And tell him, that I love him.

1060
01:08:59,989 --> 01:09:01,013
And I love you too.

1061
01:09:03,593 --> 01:09:05,618
Yeah. Yeah. That's the key.

1062
01:09:05,728 --> 01:09:08,060
You stick around, enjoy the lab.

1063
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:11,292
No, no, no darling stick around,
enjoy the lab. I will send Karan.

1064
01:09:11,534 --> 01:09:14,435
Karan! Karan!

1065
01:09:14,504 --> 01:09:15,664
You write a diary too.

1066
01:09:15,738 --> 01:09:17,000
Sometimes.

1067
01:09:17,073 --> 01:09:18,131
What do you write in the diary?

1068
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,505
No, that's personal.
- Personal.

1069
01:09:20,576 --> 01:09:22,407
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What?

1070
01:09:22,478 --> 01:09:24,070
Pull over.
- Why?

1071
01:09:24,147 --> 01:09:25,512
Pull over.
- What for?

1072
01:09:25,581 --> 01:09:26,639
I'll just tell you.

1073
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:28,474
What?
- Ice cream.

1074
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:29,609
Ice cream.

1075
01:09:29,652 --> 01:09:31,119
No way. No.

1076
01:09:31,154 --> 01:09:32,621
It's so cold, are you crazy?

1077
01:09:32,655 --> 01:09:35,123
Yes! I want ice cream right now.

1078
01:09:35,224 --> 01:09:36,623
Sana, you will fall sick!

1079
01:09:36,692 --> 01:09:37,750
I don't care.

1080
01:09:37,827 --> 01:09:39,351
I am eating ice cream, you want one?

1081
01:09:39,428 --> 01:09:41,419
No way, I don't want to fall sick?

1082
01:09:43,499 --> 01:09:45,194
Why are you laughing? What's funny?

1083
01:09:45,735 --> 01:09:48,101
You portray yourself
to be such a daredevil.

1084
01:09:48,304 --> 01:09:50,363
Living on the edge, and all.

1085
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:51,599
And you are scared of an ice cream.

1086
01:09:53,743 --> 01:09:55,040
Yes, I am scared.

1087
01:09:56,179 --> 01:09:57,544
It was different before, Sana...

1088
01:09:58,748 --> 01:10:00,147
Now I am scared.

1089
01:10:00,683 --> 01:10:02,310
I want to take care of myself.

1090
01:10:05,655 --> 01:10:07,145
I want to live, Sana!

1091
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,350
I want to have a long life.

1092
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:11,651
I want to grow old
and die in your arms.

1093
01:10:12,728 --> 01:10:14,252
No, correction.

1094
01:10:15,064 --> 01:10:16,326
I don't want to die at all.

1095
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:18,725
I want to live forever with you.

1096
01:10:23,739 --> 01:10:26,572
That's by far the most romantic
thing you have ever said to me.

1097
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:29,805
Are you going to kiss me?

1098
01:10:32,114 --> 01:10:33,172
Maybe.

1099
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,740
But only after eating the
ice cream, with my cold lips.

1100
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:37,346
My first cold kiss.

1101
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:39,011
Well, Mr. Malhotra.

1102
01:10:39,055 --> 01:10:40,317
You just wait right here.

1103
01:10:40,623 --> 01:10:44,024
You are going to be
kissed very shortly.

1104
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:46,090
With my cold lips.

1105
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:53,159
Hi.
- Hi!

1106
01:10:53,236 --> 01:10:54,703
One strawberry ice cream please.
- Yes!

1107
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:56,429
Karan!

1108
01:10:56,505 --> 01:10:58,439
Are you sure you
don't want ice cream.

1109
01:10:58,507 --> 01:10:59,565
No!

1110
01:10:59,642 --> 01:11:01,303
Just a kiss will be fine.

1111
01:11:01,377 --> 01:11:03,504
Sure! I won't share my ice cream.

1112
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:05,444
We are going to
share our entire life.

1113
01:11:05,514 --> 01:11:07,038
Who cares about an ice cream?

1114
01:11:07,116 --> 01:11:08,174
Come on.

1115
01:11:12,088 --> 01:11:14,454
Come on. Waiting for my cold kiss.

1116
01:11:26,068 --> 01:11:28,400
Sana! Sana!

1117
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:29,529
Sana! Sana!

1118
01:11:33,743 --> 01:11:34,801
What happened?

1119
01:11:35,077 --> 01:11:36,066
Oh god!

1120
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,476
Sana. Oh no.

1121
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:38,604
Is she alright? Can we help?

1122
01:11:38,681 --> 01:11:40,012
I will call the ambulance.
- Sana!

1123
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:41,140
Nothing will happen to you Sana!

1124
01:11:41,217 --> 01:11:42,275
Nothing will happen to you.

1125
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:44,113
Nothing will happen to you Sana!

1126
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,617
Ambulance is coming.

1127
01:11:45,655 --> 01:11:47,646
Nothing will happen.

1128
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:50,285
Sana. Sana. Oh god!

1129
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:52,623
Stop Karan.

1130
01:11:55,464 --> 01:11:56,522
Sana.

1131
01:11:57,533 --> 01:11:58,727
Nothing will happen to you, Sana.

1132
01:11:59,635 --> 01:12:01,125
Nothing will happen to you.

1133
01:12:01,437 --> 01:12:04,235
Nothing will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you.

1134
01:12:04,307 --> 01:12:05,365
God, somebody help!

1135
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:06,738
Somebody help!

1136
01:12:09,712 --> 01:12:12,476
I will take you to the hospital.

1137
01:12:14,116 --> 01:12:15,174
You will be fine!

1138
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:16,684
Come on, for Christ sake!

1139
01:12:17,553 --> 01:12:19,180
Somebody... Sana!

1140
01:12:19,488 --> 01:12:22,355
Today, destiny and time
both have not favoured.

1141
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:23,516
No.

1142
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:26,755
No. Nothing will happen, Sana.

1143
01:12:27,363 --> 01:12:28,557
Stay with me, Sana!

1144
01:12:29,398 --> 01:12:30,524
I am sorry Karan.

1145
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:34,665
I love you!

1146
01:12:34,737 --> 01:12:35,795
I love you, too!

1147
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:40,675
I love you, Karan.

1148
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:42,704
I love you, Sana!

1149
01:12:45,014 --> 01:12:46,072
I love you!

1150
01:12:52,655 --> 01:12:54,316
Stay with me, Sana!

1151
01:13:12,108 --> 01:13:13,575
Today I met a boy.

1152
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,168
Karan.

1153
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:16,541
He is fully mad.

1154
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,680
I am turning mad along with him.

1155
01:13:21,117 --> 01:13:23,244
Maybe this madness is called love.

1156
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:28,079
Karan and Sana in
love forever and ever.

1157
01:13:41,003 --> 01:13:43,062
Karan! Karan, look at me.

1158
01:13:44,573 --> 01:13:45,631
Look at me. Look at me.

1159
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:48,667
Look at me.

1160
01:13:49,645 --> 01:13:51,545
She's gone, Karan. She's gone.

1161
01:13:53,115 --> 01:13:54,548
Life is a cycle, Karan.

1162
01:13:56,252 --> 01:13:59,619
First it gives happiness, then
sorrows, then happiness again.

1163
01:14:01,724 --> 01:14:07,094
First comes the day
and then night, then...

1164
01:14:09,165 --> 01:14:10,757
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1165
01:14:16,372 --> 01:14:17,737
Is it the truth?

1166
01:14:19,442 --> 01:14:21,239
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1167
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:25,142
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1168
01:14:26,715 --> 01:14:28,410
My Sana is no more, uncle Ya.

1169
01:14:30,085 --> 01:14:31,677
She is no more with me.

1170
01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:34,756
I cannot see her anymore.

1171
01:14:35,758 --> 01:14:38,659
I cannot feel her. I cannot
even hear her voice, uncle Ya.

1172
01:14:40,095 --> 01:14:44,657
It is not fair, uncle Ya. It
is not fair. It is not fair.

1173
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,161
I cannot live without her, uncle Ya.

1174
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,530
Return my Sana to me, uncle Ya.

1175
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:57,409
I don't want anything else.

1176
01:14:58,714 --> 01:15:00,238
Do something. Do something.

1177
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:10,152
"Death or Life..."

1178
01:15:12,127 --> 01:15:18,430
"Whatever be the barrier."

1179
01:15:19,702 --> 01:15:24,765
"It doesn't wait."

1180
01:15:27,142 --> 01:15:32,705
"This kind of love."

1181
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:40,617
"It will melt God's heart."

1182
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:47,394
"How is our love story?"

1183
01:15:49,265 --> 01:15:55,500
"It's like a dream, our love story."

1184
01:16:04,013 --> 01:16:05,537
Ms. Chalk. Come on please.

1185
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,473
Infinity!

1186
01:16:40,316 --> 01:16:42,978
You fool. You are a lousy fool.

1187
01:16:43,018 --> 01:16:45,384
You wasted 15 years.

1188
01:16:47,389 --> 01:16:49,357
Where is my chalk, Chalk?

1189
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:04,005
I have got it. I have
got it. I have got it.

1190
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:12,439
It works. It works.

1191
01:17:12,514 --> 01:17:14,004
I can't believe it yes it works.

1192
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,414
It works Karan, it works.

1193
01:17:17,419 --> 01:17:20,320
My time machine works.

1194
01:17:20,422 --> 01:17:21,446
Good uncle Ya.

1195
01:17:22,057 --> 01:17:23,149
I am happy for you.

1196
01:17:23,225 --> 01:17:24,419
Brother Karan.

1197
01:17:24,493 --> 01:17:25,551
Brother Karan.

1198
01:17:27,296 --> 01:17:28,695
You don't look happy.

1199
01:17:29,098 --> 01:17:31,032
Look, I can't see you like this.

1200
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:35,031
If by bringing Sana back I
can put a smile to your face...

1201
01:17:35,104 --> 01:17:37,629
...then we will bring back Sana.

1202
01:17:39,308 --> 01:17:40,969
Bring back Sana.

1203
01:17:42,144 --> 01:17:44,044
From the past.

1204
01:17:45,047 --> 01:17:47,641
We just have to go 4
days back, that's it.

1205
01:17:47,716 --> 01:17:51,117
All you have to do is
avoid the accident, that's all.

1206
01:17:51,186 --> 01:17:52,517
Uncle Ya.
- Yes.

1207
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:56,518
Is it possible, uncle Ya?

1208
01:17:57,092 --> 01:17:59,652
Can Sana... is it possible, uncle Ya.

1209
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:01,992
Not until yesterday,
but it is possible now...

1210
01:18:02,064 --> 01:18:04,157
...thanks to the time machine!

1211
01:18:04,233 --> 01:18:05,427
Are you ready?

1212
01:18:06,135 --> 01:18:07,500
Come with me boy.

1213
01:18:11,573 --> 01:18:13,336
Oh no, this can't
happen to me now? No.

1214
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:16,077
What happened, uncle Ya.
- It's hung.

1215
01:18:16,145 --> 01:18:17,203
The time code has been locked.

1216
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:18,541
It's stuck in one place.

1217
01:18:19,014 --> 01:18:21,209
It's says Mumbai 2050. I
can do nothing to change it.

1218
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:24,349
Mumbai 2050, uncle?

1219
01:18:25,454 --> 01:18:26,512
Yes!

1220
01:18:27,523 --> 01:18:29,252
Uncle, Sana wanted to go there.

1221
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:32,355
That night when we came
inside the time machine.

1222
01:18:33,028 --> 01:18:34,552
She typed this with her own hands!

1223
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,293
She typed this with her own hands!

1224
01:18:37,966 --> 01:18:39,024
Strange.

1225
01:18:39,435 --> 01:18:41,164
That means...
- She knew, uncle.

1226
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:43,028
I can feel it uncle.

1227
01:18:43,572 --> 01:18:47,508
I don't know why but I can feel
that Sana is waiting for me, uncle.

1228
01:18:47,576 --> 01:18:48,975
She's waiting for me, uncle.

1229
01:18:49,044 --> 01:18:50,978
She is there! Trust me, uncle!

1230
01:18:51,046 --> 01:18:52,513
I can feel it uncle.

1231
01:18:52,581 --> 01:18:55,049
Just take me there!

1232
01:18:55,117 --> 01:18:56,982
No, no, no, no!
- Mumbai 2050!

1233
01:18:57,019 --> 01:18:58,179
Karan, it's easier
to go in the past...

1234
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,482
...because we know what has occurred.

1235
01:18:59,588 --> 01:19:01,021
There is a risk in
going into the future.

1236
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,182
How will people... be?

1237
01:19:02,224 --> 01:19:04,192
Will we be able to come back?
You understand what I am saying?

1238
01:19:04,259 --> 01:19:05,385
I don't care uncle!

1239
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:10,192
Just take me to her once! Please!

1240
01:19:10,532 --> 01:19:14,400
Anyway... anyway, there is
no one here who misses me.

1241
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:17,403
That's right, who will miss you?

1242
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:21,202
Actually the one who will
miss you... is coming with you!

1243
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:23,068
I am coming with you!

1244
01:19:25,147 --> 01:19:27,206
2050, Mumbai here we go!

1245
01:19:27,282 --> 01:19:29,079
Come on, sit. Here we go!

1246
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:30,209
In the box... in the box... c'mon!

1247
01:19:30,252 --> 01:19:33,016
Time is not linear, just like
there is a difference of 8...

1248
01:19:33,055 --> 01:19:36,024
...and half hours in New York...

1249
01:19:36,091 --> 01:19:39,026
...and in Bombay... you
know it's not like...

1250
01:19:39,094 --> 01:19:41,688
It's time travel, it's instant.

1251
01:19:42,097 --> 01:19:45,225
We will land in Mumbai at
6: 15 p. M. In the evening.

1252
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,426
It will be a Friday, okay?

1253
01:19:46,502 --> 01:19:49,027
23rd September, 2050!

1254
01:19:49,104 --> 01:19:51,436
We will get only 30
days in the future.

1255
01:19:51,507 --> 01:19:53,031
You got to do your job in 30 days.

1256
01:19:53,108 --> 01:19:56,043
Now, on 22nd October at
12 o'clock in the night...

1257
01:19:56,111 --> 01:19:58,238
...we will have to come back.

1258
01:19:59,381 --> 01:20:00,439
30 days?

1259
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:01,574
30 days!

1260
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:03,242
And what if I don't find
Sana in 30 days, then?

1261
01:20:03,285 --> 01:20:05,446
I am sorry Karan, the
machine is auto-locked.

1262
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:08,547
30 days later, this machine
will return with or without us.

1263
01:20:10,058 --> 01:20:11,116
Good luck!

1264
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:14,253
I don't need luck,
uncle, I have love.

1265
01:20:14,329 --> 01:20:16,058
Good luck boy!

1266
01:20:49,364 --> 01:20:52,094
We have reached! We have reached!

1267
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:55,427
Okay!

1268
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:06,571
Uncle Ya, looks like
we are in some ruins!

1269
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:08,240
Are you sure we are in 2050?

1270
01:21:08,317 --> 01:21:09,375
I am checking! I am checking!

1271
01:21:10,052 --> 01:21:12,043
This board looks old... quite old.

1272
01:21:12,087 --> 01:21:19,584
This property is under dispute. By
order Mumbai High Court. September...

1273
01:21:22,598 --> 01:21:24,463
...2039... oh my God!

1274
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:27,601
Uncle Ya, we are in the
future, check this out!

1275
01:21:27,669 --> 01:21:28,727
We are! We are!

1276
01:21:28,804 --> 01:21:31,602
We are in front of Marine Drive!

1277
01:21:31,673 --> 01:21:34,801
Mumbai 2050, we have made it!

1278
01:21:37,346 --> 01:21:38,404
That's right!

1279
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,345
We are in Walkeshwar,
in a run down property.

1280
01:21:40,415 --> 01:21:41,473
No one comes here anymore.

1281
01:21:42,351 --> 01:21:43,409
Rahul! Thia!

1282
01:21:43,452 --> 01:21:45,249
What were you doing in the machine?

1283
01:21:45,621 --> 01:21:48,055
Sorry!
- Sorry!

1284
01:21:48,123 --> 01:21:51,024
When we heard, that you
are going to meet Sana...

1285
01:21:51,093 --> 01:21:52,560
...we couldn't stop ourselves.

1286
01:21:52,628 --> 01:21:54,755
We want to meet Sana too!

1287
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,088
We miss her.

1288
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:04,566
Okay, okay, but you will
have to behave yourselves.

1289
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:08,642
Thank you! - Thank you!

1290
01:22:29,598 --> 01:22:30,656
I am here, Sana!

1291
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:32,795
I am here to take you back!

1292
01:22:43,578 --> 01:22:45,478
What happened,
Andy? I can't find it.

1293
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:47,573
Come on Andy!

1294
01:22:47,648 --> 01:22:50,549
You don't know how important it
is to find them for Dr, Hoshi!

1295
01:22:51,252 --> 01:22:52,514
Some people must be aboard it!

1296
01:22:52,587 --> 01:22:54,077
Where are they? Find them?

1297
01:22:58,593 --> 01:23:00,584
Police! Are they looking for us?

1298
01:23:00,661 --> 01:23:03,221
We will have to hide! Yes, we
will have to hide. C'mon! Let's go.

1299
01:23:08,002 --> 01:23:09,026
Just find it!

1300
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:11,605
Don't try! Just do or die!

1301
01:23:13,107 --> 01:23:14,199
Come on, quickly!

1302
01:23:15,376 --> 01:23:16,502
Come on, come on.

1303
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:18,238
Close the door uncle!
- Close it.

1304
01:23:20,415 --> 01:23:22,349
Switch on the light!

1305
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:33,685
Wow!

1306
01:23:43,371 --> 01:23:44,395
What is this uncle Ya?

1307
01:23:44,505 --> 01:23:46,370
I think it is a
robot recycling yard.

1308
01:23:46,407 --> 01:23:48,398
All the old and inactive
robots are kept here to be fixed.

1309
01:23:48,476 --> 01:23:50,376
Like a robot hospital, you know!

1310
01:23:51,979 --> 01:23:55,244
Look at this one.
She is quite pretty!

1311
01:23:55,316 --> 01:23:56,613
Help! Help! Karan!

1312
01:23:56,684 --> 01:24:00,211
Karan! Are you okay, Karan?
- Damn! Oh God!

1313
01:24:00,388 --> 01:24:02,686
Help! Help me please.

1314
01:24:03,057 --> 01:24:06,424
Help! Help! Help me Karan!

1315
01:24:06,494 --> 01:24:08,189
It's a humanoid robot.

1316
01:24:08,262 --> 01:24:10,662
The robot in which artificial
intelligence has been used.

1317
01:24:10,731 --> 01:24:13,427
Technically, this robot can feel.

1318
01:24:13,601 --> 01:24:15,091
Jesus Christ!

1319
01:24:15,169 --> 01:24:17,637
Uncle Ya, this
robot can help us too.

1320
01:24:18,005 --> 01:24:19,029
You think you can repair it?

1321
01:24:20,007 --> 01:24:21,031
Why not!

1322
01:24:21,242 --> 01:24:24,541
Great.
- Thank you Karan! Thank you Karan!

1323
01:24:24,612 --> 01:24:26,637
You are welcome! Thank you Karan!

1324
01:24:27,615 --> 01:24:28,673
Thank you...

1325
01:24:38,626 --> 01:24:41,686
Wake up princess!

1326
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,362
Thank you! Thank you! What...

1327
01:24:45,566 --> 01:24:46,692
It is a very old model, uncle!

1328
01:24:46,968 --> 01:24:48,595
It's not old, it's a smart model.

1329
01:24:48,669 --> 01:24:49,966
I spoke the last sentence in Hindi...

1330
01:24:50,004 --> 01:24:51,198
...so she replied in Hindi!

1331
01:24:51,305 --> 01:24:54,172
If I would have asked in English,
how are you doing young lady!

1332
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,303
I am fine, thank you!

1333
01:25:03,451 --> 01:25:05,112
Who are you exactly?

1334
01:25:05,253 --> 01:25:07,551
My ID is, Q. T!

1335
01:25:07,622 --> 01:25:09,214
Quintessential Terrestrial!

1336
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:10,621
An artificial human being.

1337
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:12,158
Artificial what...

1338
01:25:13,261 --> 01:25:16,059
No. No... I think Q. T is better.

1339
01:25:16,264 --> 01:25:18,994
A cute one... Q. T! Correct?
- Yeah.

1340
01:25:19,133 --> 01:25:22,330
You have given me a new life,
you are my new master.

1341
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:24,597
Master! What is all this crap?

1342
01:25:25,206 --> 01:25:26,230
We are friends, Q. T!

1343
01:25:26,307 --> 01:25:31,267
You can call me buddy,
partner, dude... - Sec C!

1344
01:25:31,612 --> 01:25:33,239
Section C is right here!

1345
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:36,015
Q. T's permanent memory chip!

1346
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,377
Anything that's here,
can never be erased.

1347
01:25:38,619 --> 01:25:40,280
From today you are Sec C!

1348
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:42,278
Sec C!

1349
01:25:42,356 --> 01:25:44,483
Specifications!
Quintessential Terrestrial!

1350
01:25:47,361 --> 01:25:48,953
Weight 52 kilos!

1351
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:51,157
Control unit, wireless transmission!

1352
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,166
The three standard laws of robots.

1353
01:25:53,234 --> 01:25:55,065
We don't harm humans!

1354
01:25:55,136 --> 01:25:56,296
We love humans!

1355
01:25:56,971 --> 01:25:58,199
We serve humans!

1356
01:25:58,272 --> 01:25:59,466
And we love kids too.

1357
01:26:04,045 --> 01:26:06,980
Sorry Sec C, I can't find your ID!

1358
01:26:07,048 --> 01:26:08,481
Have you come from another world!

1359
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:12,110
Not from a different world Q. T,
but from a different time.

1360
01:26:13,254 --> 01:26:16,052
But we don't know anything
about this time, or place.

1361
01:26:17,258 --> 01:26:20,989
We have come from the year 2008,
to search for someone.

1362
01:26:27,268 --> 01:26:30,294
The police can arrest you
anytime for having no ID.

1363
01:26:30,404 --> 01:26:32,338
You cannot stay here
for long, like this.

1364
01:26:40,615 --> 01:26:41,673
Q. T, what's that?

1365
01:26:42,016 --> 01:26:45,110
The City Centre, this is
where all the youngsters hangout!

1366
01:26:45,353 --> 01:26:47,344
Wow! Let's go Q. T, please!

1367
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:48,479
Then, where are we going Q. T?

1368
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:50,348
Home.

1369
01:26:50,424 --> 01:26:51,482
Home!

1370
01:26:58,966 --> 01:27:00,024
Whose house is this Q. T?

1371
01:27:00,434 --> 01:27:03,665
Dr. Kolatkar! We are
absolutely safe here!

1372
01:27:04,005 --> 01:27:07,168
I have the access codes
to all the areas here.

1373
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:09,403
After all, I was born here.

1374
01:27:10,578 --> 01:27:12,978
I love this place.

1375
01:27:15,116 --> 01:27:16,174
Look at it.

1376
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:18,309
Welcome. Greetings.

1377
01:27:18,386 --> 01:27:19,444
I am Kanta!

1378
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,044
I'm the housemaid of this house.

1379
01:27:21,589 --> 01:27:23,523
You have come to our
house for the first time.

1380
01:27:23,591 --> 01:27:25,991
If you need anything,
then just say Kanta...

1381
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:27,550
...and I will come instantly!

1382
01:27:30,264 --> 01:27:31,322
Kanta!

1383
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:34,260
Yeah?
- Nothing Kanta, you leave!

1384
01:27:35,002 --> 01:27:36,026
Kanta.

1385
01:27:36,237 --> 01:27:38,034
Kanta, you can go!
- Ok.

1386
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:39,697
Kanta!

1387
01:27:40,408 --> 01:27:41,432
Sorry Kanta!

1388
01:27:41,642 --> 01:27:42,666
Will you guys stop it?

1389
01:27:42,943 --> 01:27:44,501
No one is going to say Kanta! Kanta!

1390
01:27:46,547 --> 01:27:48,174
I am sorry Kanta, that... it's okay.

1391
01:27:49,283 --> 01:27:52,150
Q. T, I am seeing you
after such a long time.

1392
01:27:52,953 --> 01:27:55,285
Dr. Kolatkar would have
been so happy to see you!

1393
01:27:55,956 --> 01:27:58,447
Right now, he has gone to
Tokyo along with his family...

1394
01:28:04,565 --> 01:28:05,623
What happened?

1395
01:28:05,966 --> 01:28:07,024
What happened?

1396
01:28:07,368 --> 01:28:11,099
If Kanta informs Dr.
Kolatkar that I am here...

1397
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:14,470
...then he'll activate the sound
alert and all of us will be caught.

1398
01:28:14,975 --> 01:28:18,001
So I've removed the
problem from the roots.

1399
01:28:18,579 --> 01:28:19,637
What?

1400
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:21,411
This is a first generation robot.

1401
01:28:22,516 --> 01:28:24,677
It's good that you
have Australian dollars!

1402
01:28:24,985 --> 01:28:26,976
Now they are collector's items!

1403
01:28:27,054 --> 01:28:29,147
You're rich. Let's go down now.

1404
01:28:41,602 --> 01:28:43,331
Fake ID activated!

1405
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,940
Fake ID activated!

1406
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:53,203
Fake ID activated!

1407
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,145
Now there is a ID chip
in everyone's wrist!

1408
01:28:55,216 --> 01:28:57,013
You will be fortunate if
this works even for a month!

1409
01:28:57,218 --> 01:28:58,515
No bill, no guarantee!

1410
01:28:58,953 --> 01:29:00,011
Yeah.

1411
01:29:24,111 --> 01:29:27,012
Tell me Sec C!

1412
01:29:27,214 --> 01:29:28,408
What are you thinking?

1413
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:31,346
We don't have much time Q. T!

1414
01:29:32,987 --> 01:29:34,113
I have to look for Sana!

1415
01:29:35,122 --> 01:29:36,180
Sana?!

1416
01:29:37,057 --> 01:29:42,017
Sana, the one who has left
her memories in my Section C!

1417
01:29:44,331 --> 01:29:45,389
And has come here

1418
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:57,640
2050 is so beautiful, I feel
like embracing every passerby!

1419
01:29:58,412 --> 01:29:59,504
Hey! Watch out!

1420
01:30:01,015 --> 01:30:03,950
Uncle Ya, this is not
Australia. It's Mumbai!

1421
01:30:05,019 --> 01:30:07,510
Honeymoon packages,
starting at 17 million IN R!

1422
01:30:07,588 --> 01:30:09,579
Now have your honeymoon on the moon.

1423
01:30:09,657 --> 01:30:13,115
Tour the moon, spend
your holidays on the moon.

1424
01:30:13,294 --> 01:30:14,420
See you on the moon.

1425
01:30:15,563 --> 01:30:17,190
A beauty of a car.

1426
01:30:19,433 --> 01:30:21,492
But its strength lies in its style.

1427
01:30:27,575 --> 01:30:28,599
Ceat tires!

1428
01:30:32,646 --> 01:30:35,046
Celebrating 100 years of Ceat Tires.

1429
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,047
Are you eating it
yourself or giving others?

1430
01:30:38,118 --> 01:30:39,176
Give it to madam.

1431
01:30:39,386 --> 01:30:40,444
Which one do you want ma'am?

1432
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:41,715
Kolkata, or Benarsi!

1433
01:30:41,989 --> 01:30:43,923
And you? Chhotu, give
them their betel-leaf!

1434
01:30:52,933 --> 01:30:55,959
Tip!
- Forget it!

1435
01:31:09,517 --> 01:31:12,543
What kind of a snake is this?
- It's a robot! - Robot?!

1436
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:14,247
Seems like there are no more
real snakes left in the world.

1437
01:31:20,227 --> 01:31:22,491
So Sec C, how did
you find our world?

1438
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:25,089
It's the same world, Q. T!

1439
01:31:26,233 --> 01:31:27,325
Only the time has changed.

1440
01:31:38,646 --> 01:31:39,977
I had told you!

1441
01:31:40,047 --> 01:31:42,914
In such a big city,
amongst so many people...

1442
01:31:42,983 --> 01:31:45,975
...it is impossible to
search for one girl!

1443
01:32:01,068 --> 01:32:02,126
Sana!

1444
01:32:06,373 --> 01:32:08,136
That's Zeisha!

1445
01:32:09,343 --> 01:32:10,605
That's Sana, Q. T!

1446
01:32:11,946 --> 01:32:13,004
That's my Sana!

1447
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:18,017
I have come here for her!

1448
01:32:19,353 --> 01:32:23,585
That's Zeisha! Pop star,
rock star, superstar Zeisha!

1449
01:32:23,657 --> 01:32:26,057
The world's most famous singer.

1450
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,618
Zeisha!

1451
01:32:29,964 --> 01:32:31,022
That's my Sana, Q. T!

1452
01:32:31,565 --> 01:32:32,964
Where can I find her, Q. T?

1453
01:32:34,234 --> 01:32:35,292
In the sky.

1454
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:36,994
In the sky?

1455
01:33:36,296 --> 01:33:40,289
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1456
01:33:41,035 --> 01:33:44,971
"Will you be my toy?"

1457
01:33:45,205 --> 01:33:49,232
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1458
01:33:49,376 --> 01:33:53,608
"Will you be my toy?"
- I've to get there now.

1459
01:33:53,681 --> 01:33:55,171
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1460
01:33:55,983 --> 01:33:57,644
"Will you be my toy?"

1461
01:33:58,252 --> 01:33:59,719
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1462
01:34:00,387 --> 01:34:02,218
"Will you be my toy?"

1463
01:34:02,656 --> 01:34:05,022
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1464
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:07,252
"Will you be my toy?"

1465
01:34:07,327 --> 01:34:09,420
Drive faster.

1466
01:34:09,496 --> 01:34:11,987
"Will you be my toy?"

1467
01:34:12,266 --> 01:34:16,600
"I play with toys
and then shatter them!"

1468
01:34:16,637 --> 01:34:21,006
"I can accept you and
then choose to leave you!"

1469
01:34:21,108 --> 01:34:25,169
"I play with toys
and then shatter them."

1470
01:34:25,612 --> 01:34:29,378
"I can accept you and
then choose to leave you!"

1471
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:33,542
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1472
01:34:33,687 --> 01:34:38,021
"Will you be my toy?"

1473
01:35:05,586 --> 01:35:09,682
"It's a new evening,
it's a new night!"

1474
01:35:10,257 --> 01:35:13,658
"Let something new happen!"

1475
01:35:13,727 --> 01:35:15,991
"Life is now!"

1476
01:35:16,063 --> 01:35:18,190
"This is life!"

1477
01:35:18,265 --> 01:35:23,032
"Without it, life is meaningless."

1478
01:35:23,237 --> 01:35:27,435
"Dance away, live
life to your fullest!"

1479
01:35:27,608 --> 01:35:31,339
"What will you get
by being sorrowful?"

1480
01:35:31,411 --> 01:35:35,040
"Hey you, lover boy!
Will you be my toy?"

1481
01:35:36,016 --> 01:35:38,041
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1482
01:35:38,152 --> 01:35:40,416
"Will you be my toy?"

1483
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:45,185
"I play with toys
and then shatter them!"

1484
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:49,388
"I can accept and leave you!"

1485
01:35:49,563 --> 01:35:53,624
"I play with toys
and then shatter them!"

1486
01:35:54,234 --> 01:35:57,567
"I can accept and leave you!"

1487
01:35:57,604 --> 01:35:59,162
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1488
01:36:00,007 --> 01:36:01,975
"Will you be my toy?"

1489
01:36:02,376 --> 01:36:04,571
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1490
01:36:04,645 --> 01:36:07,045
"Will you be my toy?"

1491
01:36:07,114 --> 01:36:11,016
"Hey you, lover boy!"

1492
01:36:11,385 --> 01:36:15,344
"Will you be my toy?"

1493
01:36:30,604 --> 01:36:32,003
Q. T, we don't have much time!

1494
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:41,538
"Hey you!"

1495
01:36:45,619 --> 01:36:48,679
Zeisha!

1496
01:36:48,956 --> 01:36:52,949
Zeisha!

1497
01:36:53,026 --> 01:36:57,963
Zeisha!

1498
01:37:00,234 --> 01:37:07,663
Okay!
- Q. T!

1499
01:37:18,051 --> 01:37:20,383
Hey Zeisha, are you coming tonight!

1500
01:37:20,454 --> 01:37:21,512
Yeah, I am coming!

1501
01:37:24,258 --> 01:37:25,657
Now I will have to go.

1502
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:39,697
Hi!

1503
01:37:42,209 --> 01:37:43,267
Hi!

1504
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:47,137
Sana!

1505
01:38:12,205 --> 01:38:14,571
No, please step back! I said, no.

1506
01:38:19,446 --> 01:38:22,040
Oh God! We will have to go
to the rehearsal! C'mon!

1507
01:38:22,115 --> 01:38:23,673
Excuse me, thank you.

1508
01:38:37,998 --> 01:38:41,627
Sana, I have come to
steal some fate from time.

1509
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:44,364
I will take you along with me!

1510
01:38:46,573 --> 01:38:48,063
System overloaded.

1511
01:38:48,575 --> 01:38:52,978
Boo stop eating power!

1512
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:59,214
So what?
- I work so hard too!

1513
01:38:59,953 --> 01:39:01,215
Zeebelle doesn't tell me anything!

1514
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:04,418
Activate the mirrors please!

1515
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,018
Boo!

1516
01:39:08,562 --> 01:39:09,620
Boo!

1517
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,958
Coming Zeebelle?

1518
01:39:11,231 --> 01:39:14,029
Bring my blue-T, Boo! So late!

1519
01:39:14,234 --> 01:39:15,394
What Zebelle?

1520
01:39:16,003 --> 01:39:18,301
Blue T! Blue T!

1521
01:39:18,372 --> 01:39:19,964
Where is the Blue T?

1522
01:39:20,007 --> 01:39:22,032
What would you like today? Touch!

1523
01:39:22,976 --> 01:39:24,637
Blue T! Touch!

1524
01:39:26,046 --> 01:39:27,980
There is the blue T, out.

1525
01:39:28,048 --> 01:39:29,709
Have a good day!

1526
01:39:32,986 --> 01:39:34,214
I tore it!

1527
01:39:34,988 --> 01:39:36,114
Now what should I do?
- That's it!

1528
01:39:36,556 --> 01:39:39,286
If you don't get me my top by
the count of 3! You have had it!

1529
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:40,417
Okay!

1530
01:39:42,162 --> 01:39:44,062
I hid it!
- Zebelle!

1531
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:49,965
1... 2... 3...
- Snip it Boo, bring me my top!

1532
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:51,128
It got torn!

1533
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:53,038
How?

1534
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,332
Turn around! Turn around!

1535
01:39:54,374 --> 01:39:55,432
Turn around!
- No!

1536
01:39:55,509 --> 01:39:57,067
I don't want to be kicked!

1537
01:39:57,144 --> 01:39:59,078
C'mon! - One kick for three mistake
s! That was the deal.

1538
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:01,008
I have made only one mistake.

1539
01:40:01,081 --> 01:40:02,514
Oh yeah!
- Just one mistake!

1540
01:40:02,949 --> 01:40:05,179
Mistake number 1, you tore my T!

1541
01:40:05,252 --> 01:40:07,311
Boo, Now I will be kicked.

1542
01:40:07,387 --> 01:40:09,548
Mistake number 2,
you have delayed me!

1543
01:40:09,623 --> 01:40:10,681
Flee...
- Mistake number 3...

1544
01:40:10,757 --> 01:40:12,691
...by talking about that
stupid Ricky Martin you have...

1545
01:40:14,561 --> 01:40:15,619
Boo!

1546
01:40:16,129 --> 01:40:17,187
Boo!

1547
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:18,991
Dirty! Boo's dirty!

1548
01:40:19,066 --> 01:40:20,966
I will be kicked.

1549
01:40:21,601 --> 01:40:23,159
Boo, you have so had it from me.

1550
01:40:23,703 --> 01:40:32,168
Aww! My bummy hurts!

1551
01:40:33,547 --> 01:40:35,515
You are the
naughtiest robot in the world.

1552
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:40,381
Shell House, the most
beautiful house in the city!

1553
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:45,048
They are so pretty, Boo!

1554
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:47,417
It's so strange!

1555
01:40:48,195 --> 01:40:50,095
These Shell houses
are here everyday.

1556
01:40:50,664 --> 01:40:56,068
Yeah. - But it seems like I am
seeing it for the first time today!

1557
01:41:55,195 --> 01:41:56,924
This Dr. Hoshi is quite a dude.

1558
01:41:59,032 --> 01:42:00,124
And so are you!

1559
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:03,226
And so are you, my boy!

1560
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:04,362
You want to eat something?

1561
01:42:04,437 --> 01:42:06,530
Yeah. Q. T! Q. T darling!

1562
01:42:06,573 --> 01:42:07,631
Some chow-chow!

1563
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:09,367
Chow-chow!

1564
01:42:09,676 --> 01:42:10,938
Chow-chow? Uncle...

1565
01:42:11,111 --> 01:42:12,942
Q. T, who is this Dr. Hoshi?

1566
01:42:13,213 --> 01:42:15,147
Dr. Hoshi is a powerful scientist!

1567
01:42:15,549 --> 01:42:16,948
He is so powerful, even
the government doesn't...

1568
01:42:17,017 --> 01:42:19,485
...dare to ask him questions!

1569
01:42:19,953 --> 01:42:21,545
He has many powers

1570
01:42:22,956 --> 01:42:24,617
Some nachos?
- Sure, nachos!

1571
01:42:25,358 --> 01:42:27,553
I have heard that he
can teleport himself!

1572
01:42:27,627 --> 01:42:29,959
Using his mind power, he
can go anywhere he desires!

1573
01:42:30,463 --> 01:42:31,953
Everyone is very scared of him!

1574
01:43:00,327 --> 01:43:01,726
Hoshi rules!

1575
01:43:04,231 --> 01:43:05,391
13 years!

1576
01:43:05,632 --> 01:43:07,998
For the past 13 years,
everyday... every moment...

1577
01:43:08,068 --> 01:43:10,536
...Hoshi has dreamt
of only one thing!

1578
01:43:10,604 --> 01:43:11,730
Just one!

1579
01:43:15,108 --> 01:43:18,077
And today, it's going to come true!

1580
01:43:18,278 --> 01:43:20,746
The time machine is here!

1581
01:43:22,249 --> 01:43:26,447
Dr. Khanna, who constructed
the time machine in 2008!

1582
01:43:26,653 --> 01:43:28,018
Who eventually, in
the the last 30 years...

1583
01:43:28,088 --> 01:43:30,488
...became the biggest
scientist in the world!

1584
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:32,624
He had an assistant in his lab!

1585
01:43:32,692 --> 01:43:35,354
Dr. Ya trusted him a lot.

1586
01:43:35,762 --> 01:43:37,753
Horain Shimantho!

1587
01:43:38,598 --> 01:43:40,031
Alas if only his trust of 7 years...

1588
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,194
...could have lasted
for 10 more minutes.

1589
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:47,263
But, on the night
of 27th July, 2037!

1590
01:43:47,374 --> 01:43:50,707
Dr. Ya arrived 10 minutes earlier!

1591
01:43:52,245 --> 01:43:56,306
Dr. Ya lost his life,
and Hoshi lost his dream.

1592
01:43:57,584 --> 01:44:01,076
While dying, Dr. Khanna
destroyed the entire lab.

1593
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:04,190
So sad, and so stupid!

1594
01:44:04,257 --> 01:44:07,556
If Hoshi would have
acquired the time machine.

1595
01:44:07,661 --> 01:44:08,992
He would have used it so deviously...

1596
01:44:09,062 --> 01:44:13,089
...that the world would
have fallen at his feet.

1597
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,224
But, he will still make
the world fall at his feet.

1598
01:44:15,335 --> 01:44:18,099
And we will begin
with these two faces.

1599
01:44:18,405 --> 01:44:21,397
Take a close look! Find this face!

1600
01:44:21,508 --> 01:44:23,408
Go, Find him!

1601
01:44:26,413 --> 01:44:28,608
Cheer up Karan, buy some clothes!

1602
01:44:29,015 --> 01:44:31,245
Get ready to meet Zeisha!

1603
01:44:36,189 --> 01:44:38,623
Look, you can buy from Lawman.

1604
01:44:38,692 --> 01:44:42,287
Welcome to Lawman shopping.

1605
01:44:42,595 --> 01:44:44,222
You're in the image loading area.

1606
01:44:44,464 --> 01:44:46,022
Okay.

1607
01:44:46,966 --> 01:44:48,024
Thank you!

1608
01:44:48,101 --> 01:44:50,160
Welcome, your shopping starts now!

Rock star, Pret,
Haute couture, Gothic!

1610
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:53,596
Haute couture!

1611
01:44:53,673 --> 01:44:55,163
Right, loading site!

1612
01:44:57,377 --> 01:44:58,503
Jackets!

1613
01:44:58,578 --> 01:44:59,636
Jackets, it is.

1614
01:45:01,548 --> 01:45:02,606
Number 7!

1615
01:45:02,682 --> 01:45:04,980
Number 7 loaded, colour!

1616
01:45:05,051 --> 01:45:06,109
Black!

1617
01:45:06,453 --> 01:45:08,045
Try something else.

1618
01:45:09,055 --> 01:45:11,615
No. Fine, different style!

1619
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:14,718
No.

1620
01:45:17,397 --> 01:45:19,058
Yeah!
- You like it?

1621
01:45:19,332 --> 01:45:20,458
Okay, I will take this silver one!

1622
01:45:20,533 --> 01:45:21,591
Loaded sir!

1623
01:45:21,668 --> 01:45:24,228
Thank you for shopping in Lawman.
- Ok.

1624
01:45:55,168 --> 01:45:58,296
Zeisha's next public
appearance is on Thursday, Q. T!

1625
01:46:00,006 --> 01:46:03,100
She will perform a show
with her selected fans.

1626
01:46:03,443 --> 01:46:05,411
I will be able to take you there!

1627
01:46:05,478 --> 01:46:07,036
You will be able to see her too.

1628
01:46:07,113 --> 01:46:09,445
But talking to her
will be difficult!

1629
01:46:12,051 --> 01:46:13,313
Love is never easy, Q. T!

1630
01:46:22,095 --> 01:46:25,155
Ira presents, Zeisha's challenge.

1631
01:46:25,331 --> 01:46:28,129
The show you wait for every week.

1632
01:46:32,205 --> 01:46:36,335
Who knows her the most!

1633
01:46:49,489 --> 01:46:51,286
Sana! Sana!

1634
01:46:51,624 --> 01:46:56,118
Relax guys! Thank you. Hi!

1635
01:46:56,429 --> 01:46:57,487
Who's going to be on
the hot seat today?

1636
01:46:58,331 --> 01:47:03,291
Who will come on the hot seat today!

1637
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,394
Good evening people!

1638
01:47:05,472 --> 01:47:07,167
Welcome to Zeisha's challenge show...

1639
01:47:07,273 --> 01:47:10,367
...and today, I will challenge... you!

1640
01:47:10,577 --> 01:47:11,635
So let's see.

1641
01:47:12,045 --> 01:47:14,605
How well do you
really know your Zeebelle!

1642
01:47:15,048 --> 01:47:16,140
Are you ready!

1643
01:47:17,517 --> 01:47:18,575
Let's start!

1644
01:47:22,388 --> 01:47:24,219
Thank you! Thank you!

1645
01:47:24,491 --> 01:47:27,324
Al right! So let's see,
who will I question today?

1646
01:47:27,393 --> 01:47:29,361
Me! Me! Me!

1647
01:47:30,463 --> 01:47:32,522
Go for it! Go for it, Sec C!

1648
01:47:32,999 --> 01:47:36,332
Who knows Zeisha better!

1649
01:47:37,337 --> 01:47:38,395
You!

1650
01:47:38,438 --> 01:47:39,496
Hi Zeisha, I am bugs.

1651
01:47:39,606 --> 01:47:40,630
Your question!

1652
01:47:40,707 --> 01:47:43,005
Which is Zeisha's favorite color?

1653
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:44,167
Favorite color!

1654
01:47:44,344 --> 01:47:45,402
Silver!

1655
01:47:46,012 --> 01:47:48,003
Poor bugs, you are squashed!

1656
01:47:48,081 --> 01:47:51,244
Zeisha's favorite color is black,
that was so last season!

1657
01:47:51,317 --> 01:47:52,944
Yeah!

1658
01:47:53,019 --> 01:47:54,077
Who next?

1659
01:47:59,592 --> 01:48:01,150
Me! Me! Me!
- In the white...

1660
01:48:02,495 --> 01:48:05,123
Hi.
- Hi Zeisha... this is Maira!

1661
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:06,256
Your question!

1662
01:48:06,332 --> 01:48:08,630
What is Zeisha's favorite pastime?

1663
01:48:09,502 --> 01:48:10,560
Reading!

1664
01:48:10,603 --> 01:48:11,695
Reading!

1665
01:48:12,205 --> 01:48:13,365
How passe!

1666
01:48:13,573 --> 01:48:15,370
You don't know Zeisha at all!

1667
01:48:16,643 --> 01:48:17,701
Sky biking!

1668
01:48:18,077 --> 01:48:20,375
Riding in the high sky!

1669
01:48:20,446 --> 01:48:21,504
Danger!

1670
01:48:21,581 --> 01:48:22,639
That's what I like!

1671
01:48:25,285 --> 01:48:27,480
Hello. Hello.
- Hi

1672
01:48:27,587 --> 01:48:28,713
Help me!

1673
01:48:29,055 --> 01:48:31,523
You are tall. I want to see too!

1674
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:32,649
Okay!

1675
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:39,726
Me!

1676
01:48:39,999 --> 01:48:44,265
Zeisha! Me!

1677
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:48,364
You!

1678
01:48:50,376 --> 01:48:53,004
Seems like you don't
know anything about Zeisha!

1679
01:48:53,146 --> 01:48:57,446
Zeisha, I know you more
than you know yourself!

1680
01:48:57,951 --> 01:48:59,179
Oh really!

1681
01:48:59,285 --> 01:49:01,253
Now you will have to come here!

1682
01:49:03,957 --> 01:49:06,050
The boy is quite handsome!

1683
01:49:13,967 --> 01:49:15,366
Hi, welcome to...

1684
01:49:17,403 --> 01:49:18,461
Okay!

1685
01:49:19,072 --> 01:49:20,369
Welcome to Zeisha's challenge!

1686
01:49:20,473 --> 01:49:21,497
Why don't you have a seat!

1687
01:49:21,574 --> 01:49:24,042
Zeisha decides on her choice
on the hot seat for the day.

1688
01:49:24,110 --> 01:49:25,975
Okay, I hope you know the rules!

1689
01:49:26,045 --> 01:49:28,377
The questions will be about
me and only I will ask them!

1690
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:31,246
I hope you understood what's
your name? - Wrong question!

1691
01:49:31,351 --> 01:49:34,047
The questions should be
only about you, right!

1692
01:49:34,153 --> 01:49:36,621
Yeah!

1693
01:49:36,689 --> 01:49:38,088
But I will still answer it!

1694
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:39,516
Karan Malhotra!

1695
01:49:39,993 --> 01:49:41,085
Smart!

1696
01:49:41,194 --> 01:49:43,253
Both look good together!

1697
01:49:43,596 --> 01:49:44,995
My first question!

1698
01:49:45,064 --> 01:49:47,089
What is the name of my first album?

1699
01:49:48,101 --> 01:49:49,159
Me!

1700
01:49:49,235 --> 01:49:51,465
Exactly! Me, meaning Zeisha!

1701
01:49:51,571 --> 01:49:54,062
What Zeisha thinks!
What Zeisha desires!

1702
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:57,041
Who is... Zeisha!

1703
01:49:57,377 --> 01:49:58,435
Wrong question!

1704
01:49:58,544 --> 01:50:01,012
Only I will ask the question,
and you will answer it!

1705
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:04,049
Minus 500 but, I will answer it!

1706
01:50:04,417 --> 01:50:07,318
Zeisha is tomorrow's woman
that yesterday spoke about!

1707
01:50:07,453 --> 01:50:11,287
She is a mystery! She's an
enigma... she... is a riddle!

1708
01:50:11,357 --> 01:50:12,415
Anyway!

1709
01:50:12,492 --> 01:50:14,119
What kind of films do I like?

1710
01:50:18,031 --> 01:50:20,465
Love sto... Horror!

1711
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:22,191
Right!

1712
01:50:22,568 --> 01:50:24,092
500 points!

1713
01:50:26,372 --> 01:50:28,272
What's my favorite season?

1714
01:50:28,408 --> 01:50:29,500
That's easy!

1715
01:50:30,443 --> 01:50:31,535
Rain!

1716
01:50:31,611 --> 01:50:32,703
Rain!

1717
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:34,644
I love the summer!

1718
01:50:34,714 --> 01:50:35,976
In summer, we can do
open air concerts...

1719
01:50:36,049 --> 01:50:38,210
...and, I get to wear my shorts.

1720
01:50:40,086 --> 01:50:42,384
So, why am I lonely tonight Karan?

1721
01:50:44,657 --> 01:50:46,557
Your eyes are waiting for someone!

1722
01:50:47,994 --> 01:50:49,256
You are missing someone!

1723
01:50:50,463 --> 01:50:54,160
You want to... share
your life with someone!

1724
01:50:55,201 --> 01:50:56,259
Why am I lonely tonight!

1725
01:50:56,536 --> 01:50:58,436
Song No. 3! Album Me!

1726
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:01,338
Less right, more wrong!

1727
01:51:01,441 --> 01:51:02,499
No points.

1728
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:05,168
I am very happy!

1729
01:51:05,244 --> 01:51:06,302
I feel complete!

1730
01:51:06,379 --> 01:51:09,075
And anyway, Zeisha
doesn't need anyone!

1731
01:51:09,148 --> 01:51:10,206
Right everyone!

1732
01:51:12,085 --> 01:51:14,280
It's so obvious people,
you don't know...

1733
01:51:14,353 --> 01:51:17,083
...Zeisha anymore than
her name and her fame!

1734
01:51:18,291 --> 01:51:20,122
But I have recognized you!

1735
01:51:27,166 --> 01:51:28,224
Relax Karan!

1736
01:51:28,301 --> 01:51:29,700
You need such an upgrade!

1737
01:51:29,969 --> 01:51:32,164
Only then, maybe you will be
able to understand Zeisha!

1738
01:51:33,372 --> 01:51:35,067
Anyway, good luck!

1739
01:51:35,608 --> 01:51:37,473
Thank you!
- Thank you people for coming.

1740
01:51:37,543 --> 01:51:38,635
That was all for today's show!

1741
01:51:38,711 --> 01:51:41,976
And I will see you next
time on Zeisha's challenge!

1742
01:51:42,248 --> 01:51:45,342
Come back next week...

1743
01:51:45,918 --> 01:51:47,044
Friends!

1744
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,012
Keep in touch!

1745
01:51:49,088 --> 01:51:52,148
For invitations for the
next week, check out...

1746
01:51:55,928 --> 01:51:58,260
She looks exactly
like Sana, isn't it?

1747
01:51:58,331 --> 01:52:00,026
It's just that her hair is red!

1748
01:52:00,099 --> 01:52:02,465
Fool, she is Sana!

1749
01:52:02,935 --> 01:52:04,459
But she doesn't know it!

1750
01:52:05,538 --> 01:52:08,063
Then we will tell her,
isn't it brother-in-law?

1751
01:52:09,475 --> 01:52:10,533
No Rahul!

1752
01:52:11,677 --> 01:52:13,144
The world has changed a lot!

1753
01:52:15,014 --> 01:52:16,379
And your sister Sana too!

1754
01:52:16,449 --> 01:52:18,610
So, won't she recognize us too?

1755
01:52:30,229 --> 01:52:32,094
How do I explain
these children, mom?

1756
01:52:35,401 --> 01:52:37,164
She doesn't even
remember who she is!

1757
01:52:38,671 --> 01:52:41,003
How can she
recognize these children?

1758
01:52:45,211 --> 01:52:49,580
How can I make her
believe that she's my Sana?

1759
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:05,188
Karan!
- Yes.

1760
01:53:05,264 --> 01:53:07,357
Come on, let's have some breakfast!

1761
01:53:09,035 --> 01:53:10,297
I have a message!

1762
01:53:10,436 --> 01:53:11,528
It's from Boo!

1763
01:53:11,737 --> 01:53:13,204
I will switch on the speakerphone!

1764
01:53:13,239 --> 01:53:14,297
Everybody listen.

1765
01:53:14,407 --> 01:53:15,635
Hello Boo!

1766
01:53:15,708 --> 01:53:19,075
Hello Q. T, great news!

1767
01:53:19,145 --> 01:53:23,514
Zeisha was thinking
about Karan last night!

1768
01:53:24,217 --> 01:53:28,415
She didn't even write the new
song! Mana will be very angry!

1769
01:53:28,487 --> 01:53:29,545
Who is Mana?

1770
01:53:29,622 --> 01:53:32,182
Don't ask me who Mana is!

1771
01:53:32,325 --> 01:53:34,759
Have you ever seen a wild cat?

1772
01:53:35,127 --> 01:53:37,391
She is a wild cat!

1773
01:53:37,463 --> 01:53:38,760
Mana is just like that!

1774
01:53:39,131 --> 01:53:42,157
Mana is Zebelle's best
friend and manager too!

1775
01:53:42,268 --> 01:53:44,293
I don't like her!

1776
01:53:45,004 --> 01:53:46,562
Oh, Mana!

1777
01:53:49,976 --> 01:53:51,068
What happened, Boo?

1778
01:53:51,277 --> 01:53:55,407
What can I say Q. T? I am ruined!

1779
01:53:55,481 --> 01:53:58,314
Mana caught me slandering her!

1780
01:53:58,384 --> 01:54:02,286
What else can happen to a
fool like you, foolish teddy!

1781
01:54:02,355 --> 01:54:03,447
Foolish what...

1782
01:54:04,423 --> 01:54:09,725
Boo, what nonsense are you speaking?

1783
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,388
Tell me!

1784
01:54:13,099 --> 01:54:16,125
My ears hurt.
- Okay! Okay!

1785
01:54:16,235 --> 01:54:19,500
I am not talking nonsense,
just clearing my hard disk!

1786
01:54:20,706 --> 01:54:25,200
You are using this regional
language deliberately, to tease me!

1787
01:54:25,311 --> 01:54:26,369
But you know what?

1788
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:28,344
I don't care!

1789
01:54:28,481 --> 01:54:29,607
Where is Zeisha?

1790
01:54:30,449 --> 01:54:32,383
There!
- Fine!

1791
01:54:33,552 --> 01:54:34,610
What happened Boo!

1792
01:54:35,321 --> 01:54:38,654
Q. T! I will give you such
a wonderful news...

1793
01:54:38,724 --> 01:54:40,658
...that you will jump with joy!

1794
01:54:40,726 --> 01:54:45,629
In the evening, Zebelle will
play Mortal Kombat in Gamers Zone!

1795
01:54:51,203 --> 01:54:52,261
You want another one?

1796
01:54:54,373 --> 01:54:55,465
Want another one!

1797
01:54:55,975 --> 01:54:57,033
Yes! Zeisha rules!

1798
01:54:57,109 --> 01:54:58,167
Get out of here!

1799
01:54:58,244 --> 01:54:59,302
Game over...

1800
01:54:59,378 --> 01:55:00,436
Boo this is so boring.

1801
01:55:00,513 --> 01:55:01,571
I am tired of winning!

1802
01:55:01,647 --> 01:55:03,114
Who is the next loser! Come on!

1803
01:55:03,182 --> 01:55:04,240
Let's go!

1804
01:55:04,317 --> 01:55:05,375
Want to try me!

1805
01:55:08,587 --> 01:55:09,713
What timing!

1806
01:55:10,523 --> 01:55:11,581
Lover boy!

1807
01:55:11,724 --> 01:55:13,715
Is losing your hobby or habit!

1808
01:55:14,327 --> 01:55:15,521
Come, I'll go easy on you!

1809
01:55:15,995 --> 01:55:17,053
Let's go, Sunshine!

1810
01:55:17,396 --> 01:55:18,454
Sunshine!

1811
01:55:19,198 --> 01:55:22,395
Where do you get
these ancient names from?

1812
01:55:22,535 --> 01:55:23,593
From the place I have come from.

1813
01:55:24,236 --> 01:55:25,328
And... that is?

1814
01:55:25,404 --> 01:55:29,534
Well, to be honest with you... 2008!

1815
01:55:32,078 --> 01:55:33,477
That explains it!

1816
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,480
Welcome. And I am from 1937!

1817
01:55:36,549 --> 01:55:37,607
Nice to meet you!

1818
01:55:37,683 --> 01:55:39,150
Why have you come here?

1819
01:55:39,285 --> 01:55:40,343
For love!

1820
01:55:41,153 --> 01:55:42,142
Just a tip!

1821
01:55:42,355 --> 01:55:44,619
There is no such thing
as love in our world!

1822
01:55:44,690 --> 01:55:47,090
So maybe, you will have
to return empty handed!

1823
01:55:48,561 --> 01:55:49,619
Really!

1824
01:55:53,632 --> 01:55:55,156
Enough of this verbal shapang!

1825
01:55:55,368 --> 01:55:56,699
You want to play, let's go!

1826
01:55:58,004 --> 01:55:59,164
Game on!

1827
01:56:15,054 --> 01:56:16,248
Good luck lover boy!

1828
01:56:17,456 --> 01:56:19,720
I don't need luck! I have love!

1829
01:56:20,192 --> 01:56:21,250
Bring it on!

1830
01:56:30,403 --> 01:56:31,734
What a nice shot!

1831
01:56:32,038 --> 01:56:33,096
I've come here to
receive those shots.

1832
01:57:07,173 --> 01:57:08,197
Want another one!

1833
01:57:09,175 --> 01:57:10,369
Come on lover boy

1834
01:57:13,512 --> 01:57:14,570
You!

1835
01:57:16,715 --> 01:57:18,012
Watch me!

1836
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:23,054
Play on, best of luck!

1837
01:57:23,589 --> 01:57:25,250
I don't need luck! I have...

1838
01:57:26,525 --> 01:57:27,583
Let's go!

1839
01:57:28,194 --> 01:57:29,252
Yes!

1840
01:57:44,543 --> 01:57:46,010
I win!

1841
01:57:47,079 --> 01:57:49,673
Game over. Zeisha wins.

1842
01:57:49,982 --> 01:57:51,677
I told you, you would lose!

1843
01:57:51,951 --> 01:57:53,009
Didn't I tell him, Boo?

1844
01:57:53,486 --> 01:57:54,544
That's what you think!

1845
01:57:58,557 --> 01:58:00,991
But Zebelle, he was good!

1846
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:39,589
Dr. Yatinder Khanna, Science Centre!

1847
01:58:39,732 --> 01:58:41,723
You will get all
the information here

1848
01:58:43,569 --> 01:58:44,934
Everything here is about me!

1849
01:58:46,438 --> 01:58:47,530
Hello there!

1850
01:58:47,573 --> 01:58:50,007
We have information
about people living in Mars

1851
01:58:50,142 --> 01:58:51,336
Do you want to ask anything?

1852
01:58:53,145 --> 01:58:54,203
Nothing!

1853
01:58:54,413 --> 01:58:55,471
Okay!

1854
01:58:56,348 --> 01:58:58,145
Hello there, were
you looking for me?

1855
01:58:58,551 --> 01:59:00,212
No, time machine,

1856
01:59:00,486 --> 01:59:03,080
Time machine! On your right,
next counter please!

1857
01:59:03,556 --> 01:59:04,614
Thank you!

1858
01:59:12,298 --> 01:59:14,163
Hello there, were
you looking for me?

1859
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:15,562
No, time machine.

1860
01:59:17,203 --> 01:59:18,568
Hey kids, come on I am
asking about myself!

1861
01:59:18,604 --> 01:59:19,662
Yeah, let's go!

1862
01:59:20,272 --> 01:59:21,364
Dr. Yatinder Khanna!

1863
01:59:21,473 --> 01:59:22,997
Good looking! Genius!

1864
01:59:26,178 --> 01:59:28,578
Good morning,
greetings! Welcome to my museum!

1865
01:59:28,647 --> 01:59:30,171
I am Dr. Yatinder Khanna!

1866
01:59:30,382 --> 01:59:32,577
Worlds first time traveler!

1867
01:59:32,718 --> 01:59:34,709
Anything you want to know
about me and my inventions!

1868
01:59:35,054 --> 01:59:36,578
You can ask, you will
get the right answer!

1869
01:59:36,722 --> 01:59:39,247
As they say, from the horses mouth!

1870
01:59:40,326 --> 01:59:41,384
Okay! Okay!

1871
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:44,588
Other than the time machine,
which other inventions have I done?

1872
01:59:45,331 --> 01:59:47,196
Not you, me!

1873
01:59:47,399 --> 01:59:48,593
Yes, yes, you!

1874
01:59:49,468 --> 01:59:50,662
The list is endless!

1875
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:52,130
I made humanoid robots
like you, young lady!

1876
01:59:52,238 --> 01:59:53,330
Pretty lady!

1877
01:59:53,572 --> 01:59:55,039
You should be ashamed.

1878
01:59:56,275 --> 01:59:57,537
Color changing wall paint!

1879
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:58,668
Laser pens!

1880
01:59:58,944 --> 02:00:00,002
Energy stations.

1881
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:01,137
My God, how will I do all this?

1882
02:00:01,213 --> 02:00:02,271
I haven't even started!

1883
02:00:03,082 --> 02:00:04,674
Excuse me, I have
already invented all this.

1884
02:00:05,084 --> 02:00:07,143
You can see the demonstration
in the right wing of the lobby

1885
02:00:07,486 --> 02:00:09,477
Oh God, I am so nervous.
I can't breathe.

1886
02:00:10,089 --> 02:00:12,990
You can view my medical inventions
on the left wing of the lobby.

1887
02:00:13,158 --> 02:00:14,420
Look, you don't understand.

1888
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,027
You and I, we both are the same.

1889
02:00:16,095 --> 02:00:18,086
I am doctor Yatinder
Khanna, from 2008!

1890
02:00:19,164 --> 02:00:22,964
Tell me one thing, I... I mean... we!
Did we only keep inventing things...

1891
02:00:23,002 --> 02:00:24,697
...or did we get married?

1892
02:00:25,004 --> 02:00:27,199
I don't discuss my personal life!

1893
02:00:28,007 --> 02:00:29,975
Your personal and my
personal life is the same...

1894
02:00:30,042 --> 02:00:31,100
...I told you I am Dr. Khanna!

1895
02:00:31,176 --> 02:00:32,370
Wrong, I am doctor Khanna!

1896
02:00:32,978 --> 02:00:34,377
Fine, then tell me!

1897
02:00:34,513 --> 02:00:38,711
Do you understand the
principles of astrology?

1898
02:00:39,118 --> 02:00:40,710
Principles! Astrology!

1899
02:00:41,053 --> 02:00:42,179
If you are the real Dr. Khanna...

1900
02:00:42,254 --> 02:00:44,654
...then tell me which
is your favorite film?

1901
02:00:45,257 --> 02:00:46,315
Films!

1902
02:00:46,659 --> 02:00:48,991
I am a scientist!
I don't watch films!

1903
02:00:49,128 --> 02:00:52,325
Really! Then who the hell
saw Mogul-E-Azam 17 times!

1904
02:00:52,464 --> 02:00:56,662
By God! I am not against love,
I am a strong follower of my values!

1905
02:00:56,935 --> 02:00:58,459
What was Anarkali's real name?

1906
02:00:58,570 --> 02:00:59,628
Akbar...

1907
02:01:00,172 --> 02:01:01,230
Saleem...

1908
02:01:01,373 --> 02:01:02,465
Anarkali...

1909
02:01:02,941 --> 02:01:03,999
Come, come, come.

1910
02:01:06,412 --> 02:01:08,004
You are the fake Dr. Ya!

1911
02:01:13,018 --> 02:01:14,417
What did you do Dr. Khanna?

1912
02:01:14,553 --> 02:01:16,020
You go the system hanged!

1913
02:01:16,221 --> 02:01:18,689
We needed a lot of
information from him.

1914
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:09,532
What happened, Zebelle!

1915
02:02:13,345 --> 02:02:14,403
Nothing!

1916
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,674
Did you write the song Zebelle?

1917
02:02:16,548 --> 02:02:18,345
No, I am thinking!

1918
02:02:19,218 --> 02:02:22,278
Please write it, Mana has
given tomorrow's deadline!

1919
02:02:22,621 --> 02:02:24,350
Tell her, I cannot
do it by tomorrow!

1920
02:02:24,957 --> 02:02:26,219
Who, me?

1921
02:02:26,425 --> 02:02:27,619
No way!

1922
02:02:29,561 --> 02:02:31,085
Why are you so scared of her?

1923
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:32,288
Come here!

1924
02:02:33,365 --> 02:02:35,390
She is my business manager,
not an alien!

1925
02:02:36,402 --> 02:02:37,494
Topic change!

1926
02:02:37,603 --> 02:02:39,400
By the way, Zebelle!

1927
02:02:39,571 --> 02:02:42,096
If you weren't writing the song,
then what were you doing for so long?

1928
02:02:42,374 --> 02:02:43,500
Topic change.

1929
02:02:43,575 --> 02:02:45,372
You were thinking
about Karan, isn't it?

1930
02:02:45,511 --> 02:02:46,569
Topic change!

1931
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:53,381
By the way Boo, do you think
I should think about Karan?

1932
02:02:53,452 --> 02:02:54,510
Topic change!

1933
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:57,987
By the way Zebelle, what
else can you do other...

1934
02:02:58,056 --> 02:03:00,115
...than thinking about Karan?

1935
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:02,058
Topic change!

1936
02:03:02,594 --> 02:03:05,256
By the way Boo, it's
no use talking to you!

1937
02:03:05,531 --> 02:03:07,396
Whatever needs to be done,
Mana will do it!

1938
02:03:08,534 --> 02:03:10,195
Mana won't do anything!

1939
02:03:10,335 --> 02:03:11,734
Mana will only refuse!

1940
02:03:12,004 --> 02:03:13,028
Topic change!

1941
02:03:13,105 --> 02:03:14,197
No!

1942
02:03:14,239 --> 02:03:15,297
Topic change!
- No!

1943
02:03:15,374 --> 02:03:16,466
I said, topic change.

1944
02:03:16,542 --> 02:03:17,600
Topic change! Topic change!

1945
02:03:17,676 --> 02:03:19,200
No, no!

1946
02:03:19,812 --> 02:03:21,040
Stop! Stop! You are tickling!

1947
02:03:22,147 --> 02:03:23,409
Oh Zeisha!

1948
02:03:23,749 --> 02:03:26,650
For the past half an hour you
have been talking about Karan!

1949
02:03:27,019 --> 02:03:28,418
Karan! Karan! Karan!

1950
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:30,554
Why don't you just get
him out of your system?

1951
02:03:31,323 --> 02:03:33,416
Hit ice and let's go clubbing!

1952
02:03:34,026 --> 02:03:35,084
Good plan!

1953
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,218
And you know what?

1954
02:03:36,295 --> 02:03:37,353
I think you are right!

1955
02:03:38,197 --> 02:03:39,630
I shouldn't meet him again!

1956
02:03:42,501 --> 02:03:43,593
All you people in the house!

1957
02:03:43,669 --> 02:03:44,966
Let's welcome the
international superstar Ziesha!

1958
02:03:45,003 --> 02:03:46,061
For a second I thought he was Karan!

1959
02:03:46,171 --> 02:03:47,195
Just forget him!

1960
02:03:47,272 --> 02:03:48,364
How can I forget him?

1961
02:03:48,407 --> 02:03:49,499
He is everywhere?

1962
02:03:49,575 --> 02:03:50,701
It's affecting your work Zeisha!

1963
02:03:51,009 --> 02:03:54,206
You haven't written a
song in last three days!

1964
02:03:54,346 --> 02:03:55,608
You have cancelled three shows!

1965
02:03:56,982 --> 02:03:58,381
Now don't tell me you
are in love with him!

1966
02:04:00,185 --> 02:04:01,243
Why?

1967
02:04:01,453 --> 02:04:02,511
Why can't I be in love with him?

1968
02:04:02,588 --> 02:04:05,113
Because you are Ziesha!
- C'mon Mana!

1969
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,264
What! The party is over?

1970
02:05:07,719 --> 02:05:09,084
"Whether you come or not...

1971
02:05:10,222 --> 02:05:12,213
...I will come to see you!"

1972
02:05:12,291 --> 02:05:13,383
"Whether you say it or not..."

1973
02:05:14,459 --> 02:05:15,721
"Whether you say it or not...

1974
02:05:16,728 --> 02:05:18,593
...I will say it!"

1975
02:05:18,730 --> 02:05:20,027
"Whether you hear or not...

1976
02:05:20,999 --> 02:05:22,227
...I will make you hear it!"

1977
02:05:23,335 --> 02:05:25,200
"What my heart says!"

1978
02:05:25,237 --> 02:05:30,470
"My heart says to you!"

1979
02:05:30,609 --> 02:05:33,339
"Why is there a
distance between us?"

1980
02:05:33,579 --> 02:05:37,606
"Why should we stay separated?"

1981
02:06:26,431 --> 02:06:30,424
"Whether you take a
look or you don't...

1982
02:06:30,602 --> 02:06:35,096
...there are a hundred
images in them of my dreams."

1983
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:37,140
"Whether you believe it or not...

1984
02:06:37,275 --> 02:06:44,078
...but both our hands,
have similar fate!"

1985
02:06:45,617 --> 02:06:47,016
"Whether you embark or not...

1986
02:06:47,686 --> 02:06:49,677
...the path calls you!"

1987
02:06:49,955 --> 02:06:51,217
"Whether you hide or not."

1988
02:06:52,157 --> 02:06:54,352
"Whether you hide or not...

1989
02:06:54,559 --> 02:06:56,356
...they stare at you!"

1990
02:06:56,495 --> 02:06:57,985
"Whether you get appeased or not!"

1991
02:06:58,463 --> 02:07:00,294
"Whether you get appeased or not...

1992
02:07:00,432 --> 02:07:02,992
...they try to appease you!"

1993
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:07,161
"Me and my loyalty!"

1994
02:07:42,407 --> 02:07:44,341
"Whether you accept it or not...

1995
02:07:44,543 --> 02:07:51,107
...but I appear known to you!"

1996
02:07:51,316 --> 02:07:53,147
"Whether you say it or not...

1997
02:07:53,285 --> 02:08:00,157
...through the eyes,
there is a saga being made!"

1998
02:08:00,959 --> 02:08:03,450
"Somewhere!"

1999
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:06,087
"There had to be a way!"

2000
02:08:06,231 --> 02:08:07,357
"Sometime!"

2001
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,394
"Sometime!

2002
02:08:10,469 --> 02:08:12,460
"Sorrows had to end!"

2003
02:08:12,604 --> 02:08:16,005
"Some day!"

2004
02:08:17,142 --> 02:08:23,103
"The love that had
to blossom, it has!"

2005
02:08:23,381 --> 02:08:25,372
"My heart says to you!"

2006
02:08:25,584 --> 02:08:29,315
"Why is there a
distance between us?"

2007
02:08:29,454 --> 02:08:31,251
"Why should we stay separated?"

2008
02:09:12,531 --> 02:09:13,657
Good morning Zeisha!

2009
02:09:14,032 --> 02:09:15,158
Good morning!

2010
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:16,494
What would you like today?

2011
02:09:17,602 --> 02:09:19,661
Could I have the
bedroom menu please?

2012
02:09:19,971 --> 02:09:20,995
Sure!

2013
02:09:26,144 --> 02:09:27,202
The color palette!

2014
02:09:27,345 --> 02:09:28,573
Here is the color palette!

2015
02:09:29,014 --> 02:09:30,242
What color would you like?

2016
02:09:30,382 --> 02:09:31,440
Pink!

2017
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:33,278
I feel pink today!

2018
02:09:37,055 --> 02:09:38,113
Too bright!

2019
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:39,448
One shade lighter please!

2020
02:09:39,524 --> 02:09:40,582
Sure!

2021
02:09:43,528 --> 02:09:44,654
It's perfect!

2022
02:09:45,997 --> 02:09:47,464
Good morning Zeisha!

2023
02:09:48,033 --> 02:09:49,967
Good morning Boo!

2024
02:09:52,137 --> 02:09:53,229
Pink!

2025
02:09:53,338 --> 02:09:54,930
Why suddenly pink today?

2026
02:09:55,507 --> 02:09:56,974
I like pink now!

2027
02:09:57,943 --> 02:09:59,410
Pink is the color of love.

2028
02:09:59,678 --> 02:10:01,168
Zeisha is in love!

2029
02:10:01,313 --> 02:10:02,405
No, I am not!

2030
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:03,538
Zeisha is in love!

2031
02:10:03,615 --> 02:10:04,946
No she is not!

2032
02:10:05,016 --> 02:10:06,210
Zeisha is in love!

2033
02:10:06,351 --> 02:10:07,409
Shut up Boo!

2034
02:10:07,485 --> 02:10:09,680
Zeisha is in love!
Zeisha is in love!

2035
02:10:09,955 --> 02:10:11,013
Boo!

2036
02:10:16,962 --> 02:10:18,020
Where are you?

2037
02:10:18,163 --> 02:10:20,097
Zeisha is in love!

2038
02:10:21,967 --> 02:10:22,991
Come down Boo!

2039
02:10:23,101 --> 02:10:24,159
No!

2040
02:10:24,202 --> 02:10:25,294
Come down right now!

2041
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:26,394
No way!

2042
02:10:26,471 --> 02:10:27,563
Stupid robot!

2043
02:10:35,313 --> 02:10:36,473
Incoming call, do
you want to answer?

2044
02:10:36,548 --> 02:10:37,674
Yeah!

2045
02:10:39,117 --> 02:10:40,243
Hi Karan!

2046
02:10:42,654 --> 02:10:44,019
Karan, you are still dancing?

2047
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:46,557
How do you know that I am dancing?

2048
02:10:48,293 --> 02:10:51,660
Can you see me Karan? Then
I can see you too Karan!

2049
02:10:52,297 --> 02:10:53,423
What?

2050
02:10:54,933 --> 02:10:55,957
Oh shucks!

2051
02:10:56,468 --> 02:10:57,560
Put the phone down!

2052
02:10:57,636 --> 02:10:59,035
But, when did I pick up the phone?

2053
02:11:00,939 --> 02:11:01,997
You're so funny!

2054
02:11:04,175 --> 02:11:05,301
That's not fair!

2055
02:11:05,577 --> 02:11:07,135
It's supposed to be a private show!

2056
02:11:08,113 --> 02:11:09,546
You feel shy too!

2057
02:11:09,948 --> 02:11:11,108
How sweet!

2058
02:11:11,383 --> 02:11:13,010
Can I talk to you after
I come out of the bathroom?

2059
02:11:13,151 --> 02:11:14,209
Please!

2060
02:11:14,286 --> 02:11:15,344
Absolutely not!

2061
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,217
From now on, everyday
we will talk like this!

2062
02:11:17,355 --> 02:11:18,413
Do I have to?

2063
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:19,548
Of course!

2064
02:11:19,624 --> 02:11:20,682
And if you disapprove!

2065
02:11:20,959 --> 02:11:23,427
Then I will put your
X-rated clip on the net!

2066
02:11:23,962 --> 02:11:25,020
That's not fair!

2067
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:26,690
Everything is fair in...

2068
02:11:28,967 --> 02:11:30,093
But you don't believe in love!

2069
02:11:30,302 --> 02:11:31,394
Of course I don't!

2070
02:11:31,569 --> 02:11:32,593
Topic change!

2071
02:11:32,671 --> 02:11:34,662
What are you doing
after the shower Karan?

2072
02:12:02,968 --> 02:12:04,162
Do you know how it happens?

2073
02:12:04,436 --> 02:12:07,530
If you take two magnets,
the unlike poles attract!

2074
02:12:07,639 --> 02:12:09,664
Rahul! Thia! Look who is here?

2075
02:12:10,942 --> 02:12:12,000
Come.

2076
02:12:13,278 --> 02:12:15,041
Your house...

2077
02:12:34,632 --> 02:12:37,294
Zeisha, this is my family!

2078
02:12:38,269 --> 02:12:39,395
That's uncle Ya!
- Hello!

2079
02:12:40,271 --> 02:12:42,296
Rahul! Thia!
- Hi!

2080
02:12:43,475 --> 02:12:47,104
I can't believe,
that we are meeting you!

2081
02:12:47,579 --> 02:12:49,376
We missed you a lot!

2082
02:12:52,083 --> 02:12:53,448
Can we hug you?

2083
02:12:54,986 --> 02:12:56,044
Yeah!

2084
02:12:56,321 --> 02:12:58,448
Come, come!

2085
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:07,491
Have we met before?

2086
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,395
I sorry, but I don't remember!

2087
02:13:13,204 --> 02:13:14,296
Zeisha!

2088
02:13:15,006 --> 02:13:16,598
Everyday you meet so many people?

2089
02:13:17,575 --> 02:13:18,701
How can you recognize them?

2090
02:13:19,077 --> 02:13:20,169
That's right!

2091
02:13:20,412 --> 02:13:21,709
You must have forgotten me too!

2092
02:13:22,213 --> 02:13:23,271
I have met you 7 times,
and out of that...

2093
02:13:23,348 --> 02:13:24,747
...I have forgotten 3
meetings out of that.

2094
02:13:26,184 --> 02:13:27,310
Come on kids, let's go!

2095
02:13:27,552 --> 02:13:28,644
Just a minute, uncle Ya!

2096
02:13:30,522 --> 02:13:37,291
Rahul! Thia! I forgot you both,
I am very sorry for that!

2097
02:13:38,029 --> 02:13:41,055
But I promise, it will
never happen again. Okay!

2098
02:13:43,201 --> 02:13:44,293
And you too, uncle Ya!

2099
02:13:45,303 --> 02:13:46,565
I will remember you!

2100
02:13:47,372 --> 02:13:48,999
But you don't forget me too!

2101
02:13:50,375 --> 02:13:51,433
Promise?

2102
02:13:52,644 --> 02:13:53,702
Promise!

2103
02:13:54,979 --> 02:13:56,173
Come on kids, let's go!

2104
02:13:56,314 --> 02:13:57,713
C'mon kids, let's go!

2105
02:13:57,982 --> 02:14:00,974
Bye kids! Bye!

2106
02:14:01,352 --> 02:14:02,979
They are very sweet children!

2107
02:14:05,323 --> 02:14:06,449
It's your family!

2108
02:14:10,228 --> 02:14:11,354
Forget it!

2109
02:14:12,497 --> 02:14:14,465
Dr. Khanna, can I help you!

2110
02:14:15,333 --> 02:14:16,425
Q. T!

2111
02:14:16,534 --> 02:14:17,592
You are too sweet.

2112
02:14:17,635 --> 02:14:19,000
You are too sweet.

2113
02:14:19,237 --> 02:14:20,295
I love you.

2114
02:14:20,405 --> 02:14:21,429
I love you! I love you!

2115
02:14:21,506 --> 02:14:22,598
I would have...

2116
02:14:22,674 --> 02:14:23,732
...married you! But what
can I do, there is an...

2117
02:14:23,808 --> 02:14:25,002
...age difference between us!

2118
02:14:25,076 --> 02:14:27,203
Not just age, there is a
generation gap between us!

2119
02:14:27,345 --> 02:14:28,607
Uncle Ya!

2120
02:14:31,483 --> 02:14:32,541
Don't call me uncle!

2121
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:36,015
You didn't tell me!

2122
02:14:36,087 --> 02:14:38,214
How did you feel
after coming in 2050?

2123
02:14:38,356 --> 02:14:39,550
Good!

2124
02:14:39,691 --> 02:14:41,158
But 22nd October is coming close!

2125
02:14:42,627 --> 02:14:44,026
22nd October, I have not time!

2126
02:14:45,396 --> 02:14:46,954
We will have to go on
22nd October, because...

2127
02:14:47,031 --> 02:14:49,158
...if the planets
stand in superstition!

2128
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:50,292
Then we will be in
trouble, because...

2129
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,494
...the planets will be
in the configuration...

2130
02:14:51,569 --> 02:14:54,060
We have to go on the 22nd October!

2131
02:14:55,173 --> 02:14:58,540
You think Zeisha
will go back with Karan?

2132
02:14:58,676 --> 02:15:02,407
That depends on Karan if he can
persuade her to come back with him!

2133
02:15:03,214 --> 02:15:05,978
Then will you leave Sec C back?

2134
02:15:06,117 --> 02:15:07,175
No!

2135
02:15:07,318 --> 02:15:08,376
No, Sec C cannot stay here!

2136
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,181
If we left him behind...

2137
02:15:10,255 --> 02:15:12,189
...then instantly he will
grow 42 years older and he...

2138
02:15:13,725 --> 02:15:15,124
Karan cannot stay here!

2139
02:15:15,493 --> 02:15:18,985
He cannot stay back here,
Zeisha may not want to go back...

2140
02:15:19,063 --> 02:15:20,724
...then what is this mission for?

2141
02:15:22,033 --> 02:15:24,228
You cannot see gains
and losses in relations!

2142
02:15:24,402 --> 02:15:27,235
Humans only make
relations and try to abide by it.

2143
02:15:27,405 --> 02:15:28,599
Everything else is destiny!

2144
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:34,271
So this is my studio!

2145
02:15:34,679 --> 02:15:36,203
I compose all my songs here!

2146
02:15:36,347 --> 02:15:37,405
Lights!

2147
02:15:38,683 --> 02:15:40,742
It's got an Alibaba theme?

2148
02:15:41,019 --> 02:15:42,008
You like it?

2149
02:15:42,086 --> 02:15:44,145
Well, then I am your
Alibaba for the night!

2150
02:15:45,557 --> 02:15:47,457
You know a lot about me, Karan!

2151
02:15:47,692 --> 02:15:51,025
Actually, the entire
world knows a lot about me.

2152
02:15:51,329 --> 02:15:53,422
But I don't know anything about you!

2153
02:15:53,631 --> 02:15:55,121
Tell me something about yourself.

2154
02:15:55,600 --> 02:16:00,264
Karan Malhotra, Age
23... from... Mumbai!

2155
02:16:00,605 --> 02:16:04,473
Current status,
PhD in reincarnation!

2156
02:16:05,543 --> 02:16:06,703
Reincarnation!

2157
02:16:07,979 --> 02:16:09,378
You really believe in it?

2158
02:16:11,316 --> 02:16:12,578
A lot!

2159
02:16:14,285 --> 02:16:15,513
That's why I am doing a PhD!

2160
02:16:16,554 --> 02:16:17,612
Of course!

2161
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:20,048
You don't believe it?

2162
02:16:23,394 --> 02:16:24,520
No!

2163
02:16:25,330 --> 02:16:26,524
Are you crazy?

2164
02:16:27,432 --> 02:16:32,301
I believe, we are only born once,
we live only once, we die once...

2165
02:16:32,403 --> 02:16:33,427
And fall in love only once.

2166
02:16:33,504 --> 02:16:34,596
Correct!

2167
02:16:34,639 --> 02:16:36,129
Wow, poetry.

2168
02:16:36,274 --> 02:16:40,335
That means, you are a
genius in, love, poetry.

2169
02:16:41,045 --> 02:16:42,103
I want to hear poetry!

2170
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:44,976
Alibaba! Recite a
poetry for Marjina!

2171
02:16:45,383 --> 02:16:47,613
Alibaba, doesn't know poetry!

2172
02:16:47,685 --> 02:16:51,519
Come on, it's very easy! You
just have to rhyme the words. - No!

2173
02:16:51,589 --> 02:16:52,647
And anyways!

2174
02:16:52,957 --> 02:16:54,288
I have made an
entire career out of it!

2175
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:58,693
If Alibaba cannot do poetry,
then Karan can!

2176
02:16:59,464 --> 02:17:00,522
For me!

2177
02:17:02,967 --> 02:17:04,491
Karan can do poetry!
- See!

2178
02:17:08,273 --> 02:17:11,071
We were miles apart!

2179
02:17:13,111 --> 02:17:15,045
The journey looked
like centuries apart.

2180
02:17:16,381 --> 02:17:18,576
The heart was unsure.

2181
02:17:20,485 --> 02:17:26,117
Still I feel... we were
destined to meet again.

2182
02:17:26,991 --> 02:17:28,049
Wow!

2183
02:17:29,027 --> 02:17:31,222
That was actually
really good, Karan!

2184
02:17:31,562 --> 02:17:32,620
Thanks.

2185
02:17:34,666 --> 02:17:36,031
I will add music to it!

2186
02:17:36,634 --> 02:17:37,999
Maglev key base!

2187
02:17:38,236 --> 02:17:39,328
Wait!

2188
02:18:01,092 --> 02:18:02,150
That was good!

2189
02:18:03,628 --> 02:18:05,152
Karan, sing it!

2190
02:18:06,164 --> 02:18:07,222
I cannot sing!

2191
02:18:07,298 --> 02:18:08,356
Karan can't sing!

2192
02:18:08,433 --> 02:18:09,559
You will have to sing!

2193
02:18:10,001 --> 02:18:11,491
I always sing for the entire world!

2194
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:13,367
But no one ever sings for me!

2195
02:18:14,172 --> 02:18:17,005
Karan, for me!

2196
02:18:41,265 --> 02:18:46,066
"We were miles apart!"

2197
02:18:46,337 --> 02:18:51,468
"The journey would take centuries."

2198
02:18:51,943 --> 02:18:56,971
"The heart was unaware!"

2199
02:18:57,348 --> 02:19:07,690
"Still I feel... we
were destined to meet!"

2200
02:19:08,192 --> 02:19:13,323
"We were miles apart!"

2201
02:20:01,412 --> 02:20:12,016
"My obsession... has
brought me so far."

2202
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:22,996
"My dreams have come true!"

2203
02:20:23,201 --> 02:20:30,607
"If I lose her now,
then why should live?"

2204
02:20:31,142 --> 02:20:33,576
"It's better that I die!"

2205
02:20:34,078 --> 02:20:44,647
"Never... say that again!"

2206
02:20:45,389 --> 02:20:49,325
"Never go..."

2207
02:20:50,394 --> 02:20:52,021
Zeisha! Oh no!

2208
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:53,988
Zeisha!

2209
02:21:19,123 --> 02:21:23,321
Fate and situation is playing
a strange game wit us, Zeisha!

2210
02:21:25,997 --> 02:21:32,402
But you had said, that
true love is biggest of all!

2211
02:21:33,404 --> 02:21:34,462
Bigger than fate!

2212
02:21:38,142 --> 02:21:39,234
I love you!

2213
02:21:49,053 --> 02:21:51,647
All night she has
been blabbering things!

2214
02:21:52,957 --> 02:21:55,983
Strange things, unknown names.

2215
02:21:57,128 --> 02:21:58,993
What has happened to my Zeisha?

2216
02:21:59,263 --> 02:22:03,256
That's why I say grandma,
stay with her.

2217
02:22:03,367 --> 02:22:05,028
I just can't handle her!

2218
02:22:11,542 --> 02:22:12,668
Finally!

2219
02:22:15,413 --> 02:22:16,471
What is all this?

2220
02:22:16,948 --> 02:22:18,006
Mute off!

2221
02:22:18,282 --> 02:22:20,944
Last night, Zeisha was seen
in an unknown boy's arms...

2222
02:22:21,018 --> 02:22:22,178
...in an unconscious state!

2223
02:22:22,253 --> 02:22:24,278
What is this matter after all?

2224
02:22:24,355 --> 02:22:25,549
Who is that boy?

2225
02:22:25,690 --> 02:22:27,157
Is it a case of drug overdose...
- Pause!

2226
02:22:28,292 --> 02:22:29,953
What is all this Zeisha?

2227
02:22:30,294 --> 02:22:31,420
What the hell is this?

2228
02:22:31,562 --> 02:22:32,620
All this is wrong?

2229
02:22:32,697 --> 02:22:34,688
It really is not what it looks like.

2230
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,662
I just wanted to live like a
normal girl just for once.

2231
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:42,064
Don't you understand,
Zeisha, that you are a star?

2232
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:44,508
But after what happened last night!

2233
02:22:44,642 --> 02:22:46,507
It's pitiable!
Just look at yourself!

2234
02:22:46,644 --> 02:22:47,702
Just look at this!

2235
02:22:47,979 --> 02:22:49,105
Can you even recognize yourself?

2236
02:22:49,313 --> 02:22:50,644
But last night I was in my senses!

2237
02:22:53,284 --> 02:23:00,622
Even I can't understand
what happened last night!

2238
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:04,027
I wish I could understand myself!

2239
02:23:04,996 --> 02:23:06,588
I wish I could explain it to you!

2240
02:23:06,731 --> 02:23:08,995
There is nothing to explain Zeisha!

2241
02:23:09,133 --> 02:23:11,124
A boy used you for his own benefit,
for cheap publicity!

2242
02:23:11,235 --> 02:23:15,535
He toyed along with
your feelings, that's it!

2243
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:17,398
Face it, girl!

2244
02:23:17,642 --> 02:23:19,473
Just me, the entire
world understands it!

2245
02:23:19,677 --> 02:23:20,735
It will be better if
you understand it too!

2246
02:23:21,012 --> 02:23:22,741
The world can be wrong!
You can be wrong!

2247
02:23:23,014 --> 02:23:25,608
But... how can Karan be wrong?

2248
02:23:26,283 --> 02:23:27,750
It is so obvious, Zeisha!

2249
02:23:28,352 --> 02:23:30,616
Karan has hypnotized you!
- Hypnotize!

2250
02:23:30,755 --> 02:23:32,552
Yes! Yes! Yes Zeisha!

2251
02:23:32,623 --> 02:23:33,681
He is a fraud!

2252
02:23:33,758 --> 02:23:35,055
His ID is fake too!

2253
02:23:35,259 --> 02:23:37,420
And who knows whether his
name is Karan or something else!

2254
02:23:38,029 --> 02:23:40,088
Just go away Mana, I can't
deal with you right now!

2255
02:23:40,498 --> 02:23:42,022
Karan is not a fraud!

2256
02:23:42,967 --> 02:23:44,992
He really loves you!

2257
02:23:48,973 --> 02:23:50,565
I've to meet Zeisha.
- You can't go in.

2258
02:23:50,641 --> 02:23:51,699
You can't see her!

2259
02:23:51,976 --> 02:23:53,443
Wait, you can't go in!
Mana, thank God!

2260
02:23:54,045 --> 02:23:56,036
Tell Zeisha that...
- Just go away Karan!

2261
02:23:56,447 --> 02:23:57,971
Stop harassing Zeisha!

2262
02:23:58,115 --> 02:23:59,173
Harass!

2263
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:00,979
You are mistaken.

2264
02:24:01,052 --> 02:24:02,519
They are saying rubbish on T. V too!

2265
02:24:02,653 --> 02:24:05,520
In fact... if Zeisha sees it...
- She has already seen it!

2266
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:07,721
She knows everything!

2267
02:24:08,526 --> 02:24:11,188
And this hypnotism that
you are trying to use.

2268
02:24:11,395 --> 02:24:12,589
That will be of no use.

2269
02:24:13,330 --> 02:24:14,388
Hypnotism!

2270
02:24:15,599 --> 02:24:18,227
What are you saying Mana...
- Oh yeah!

2271
02:24:19,003 --> 02:24:20,630
Go back, to wherever
you have come from!

2272
02:24:21,238 --> 02:24:23,206
Or else I will have
to call the police.

2273
02:24:24,475 --> 02:24:25,533
I can see now!

2274
02:24:26,143 --> 02:24:27,201
I got it!

2275
02:24:27,344 --> 02:24:28,402
You have planned all of this!

2276
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:29,537
Shut up!

2277
02:24:29,613 --> 02:24:31,205
Zeisha doesn't want to meet you.

2278
02:24:32,416 --> 02:24:36,011
You don't know what Ziesha wants!

2279
02:24:37,221 --> 02:24:40,554
Even robots have
more feelings than you!

2280
02:24:41,025 --> 02:24:44,017
That's enough, get out!
- You get out of my way!

2281
02:24:44,095 --> 02:24:45,153
I said get out!
- How dare you

2282
02:24:45,229 --> 02:24:46,287
Karan!

2283
02:24:50,301 --> 02:24:52,462
Zeisha needs rest!

2284
02:24:53,204 --> 02:24:54,262
I promise!

2285
02:24:54,572 --> 02:24:58,099
If Zeisha wants to meet you,
then I won't stop her!

2286
02:24:58,242 --> 02:24:59,641
But I want to meet her!

2287
02:25:00,177 --> 02:25:01,235
But not now!

2288
02:25:02,179 --> 02:25:03,578
Please leave now, son!

2289
02:25:04,315 --> 02:25:05,714
This is not the right time!

2290
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,382
This is not my time!

2291
02:25:13,190 --> 02:25:14,657
That's what I wanted to tell Zeisha!

2292
02:25:41,418 --> 02:25:43,352
Dr. Khanna is in our custody!

2293
02:25:43,487 --> 02:25:45,148
Please identify their clips!
- Show me!

2294
02:25:45,356 --> 02:25:46,414
Beam them!

2295
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:52,155
Welcome back, Dr. Khanna!

2296
02:25:54,565 --> 02:25:56,965
And we have traced that boy too.

2297
02:25:58,502 --> 02:26:00,970
Pedro, good!

2298
02:26:01,605 --> 02:26:03,300
We have found Dr. Khanna.

2299
02:26:03,974 --> 02:26:06,636
Now track that boy!

2300
02:26:10,648 --> 02:26:11,706
Good evening everyone!

2301
02:26:11,982 --> 02:26:13,506
It was a great
pleasure to have you all here!

2302
02:26:13,651 --> 02:26:14,982
Thank you!

2303
02:26:17,521 --> 02:26:20,046
Couldn't we have avoided
this stupid party, Mana!

2304
02:26:20,391 --> 02:26:22,052
Come on, cheer up! Smile!

2305
02:26:24,528 --> 02:26:27,463
Mr. Oberoi! Your
product launch was a hit!

2306
02:26:27,531 --> 02:26:28,998
- Thank you! Thank you so much.

2307
02:26:29,033 --> 02:26:30,125
Fabulous!

2308
02:26:31,001 --> 02:26:32,025
Zeisha!

2309
02:26:34,004 --> 02:26:35,232
It has been so long, Zeisha!

2310
02:26:36,273 --> 02:26:37,331
I really missed you!

2311
02:26:42,613 --> 02:26:43,671
Just go Karan!

2312
02:26:45,015 --> 02:26:46,141
But why Zeisha?

2313
02:26:49,620 --> 02:26:51,212
Why did you lie to me?

2314
02:26:53,958 --> 02:26:55,550
Mana must have made
you believe that I lied?

2315
02:26:59,363 --> 02:27:00,557
Your ID is fake, isn't it?

2316
02:27:00,631 --> 02:27:01,962
That doesn't matter!

2317
02:27:01,999 --> 02:27:03,091
It matters Karan!

2318
02:27:03,167 --> 02:27:05,362
I love you!
- Yes or no!

2319
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:09,630
I love you Zeisha!
- Yes or no Karan!

2320
02:27:10,641 --> 02:27:13,371
It's not that easy, Zeisha!
- Yes or no Karan!

2321
02:27:14,979 --> 02:27:16,105
I can explain myself!

2322
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:17,238
Yes or no Karan!

2323
02:27:17,314 --> 02:27:18,372
Yes!

2324
02:27:20,651 --> 02:27:22,983
Yes! My ID is fake!

2325
02:27:23,988 --> 02:27:25,455
I have lied many times to you!

2326
02:27:25,656 --> 02:27:29,649
But all those lies
lead to one truth, Zeisha!

2327
02:27:31,595 --> 02:27:36,191
But that truth is so strange,
that no one will believe it!

2328
02:27:40,004 --> 02:27:41,596
I don't belong to your world Zeisha!

2329
02:27:42,940 --> 02:27:43,998
I don't belong to your time!

2330
02:27:47,945 --> 02:27:49,207
I have come here from 2008...

2331
02:27:51,282 --> 02:27:52,943
I have time-traveled in the
world's first time machine...

2332
02:27:53,484 --> 02:27:56,146
The first journey, and
that's just because.

2333
02:27:57,554 --> 02:28:00,022
At the other end of time,
I loved a girl very much!

2334
02:28:03,294 --> 02:28:04,352
Sana!

2335
02:28:05,629 --> 02:28:07,961
We promised to spend our
whole life with each other

2336
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:12,958
And then one day...
right in these arms...

2337
02:28:13,003 --> 02:28:17,099
...she broke that promise!

2338
02:28:19,376 --> 02:28:20,434
And came here!

2339
02:28:22,112 --> 02:28:23,170
In this world!

2340
02:28:24,381 --> 02:28:26,315
Time has changed my Sana so much!

2341
02:28:26,383 --> 02:28:27,441
Karan, you are talking rubbish.

2342
02:28:29,253 --> 02:28:31,517
Whether anyone in the
world believes in love or not.

2343
02:28:33,257 --> 02:28:35,191
But lovers meet in every lifetime!

2344
02:28:36,994 --> 02:28:38,518
You will have to
believe it, Sunshine!

2345
02:28:40,464 --> 02:28:42,056
Because, you are my Sana!

2346
02:28:43,133 --> 02:28:44,157
Please Sana!

2347
02:28:44,568 --> 02:28:45,626
Sunshine!

2348
02:28:47,571 --> 02:28:49,402
Just for once, look into my eyes.

2349
02:28:50,941 --> 02:28:52,670
And tell me, don't you
see our love in them!

2350
02:28:53,944 --> 02:28:55,275
You don't see my wait for you.

2351
02:28:56,613 --> 02:28:59,946
Ask your heart, that
if you are not Sana...

2352
02:29:00,017 --> 02:29:04,613
...then why can't you
take your eyes off me?

2353
02:29:06,957 --> 02:29:11,018
Why do you feel, that
there should be no one around...

2354
02:29:12,096 --> 02:29:14,291
...but, just you and me!

2355
02:29:16,367 --> 02:29:17,561
Why do you feel that?

2356
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:21,463
That you have always
loved me, Sunshine!

2357
02:29:22,439 --> 02:29:23,497
Why?

2358
02:29:23,974 --> 02:29:25,032
Because I love you!

2359
02:29:27,311 --> 02:29:28,369
I love you!

2360
02:29:32,116 --> 02:29:33,640
Great performance!

2361
02:29:33,984 --> 02:29:38,114
Great skit by Karan, and
the ever lovely Zeisha!

2362
02:29:38,188 --> 02:29:40,247
So please put your
hands together for them!

2363
02:29:40,324 --> 02:29:43,191
Everybody! A round
of applause please!

2364
02:29:45,596 --> 02:29:47,063
Come on Zeisha, let's move!

2365
02:29:47,598 --> 02:29:48,656
Zeisha

2366
02:29:50,134 --> 02:29:51,567
Listen to me Zeisha!

2367
02:29:52,169 --> 02:29:54,137
Zeisha, listen to me!
- Leaving so early?

2368
02:29:55,506 --> 02:29:57,269
I want to talk to you!

2369
02:29:57,541 --> 02:29:58,599
Zeisha, listen to me!

2370
02:29:58,942 --> 02:30:00,000
What the hell!

2371
02:30:00,077 --> 02:30:01,135
Zeisha!

2372
02:30:01,945 --> 02:30:03,003
Zeisha!

2373
02:30:04,615 --> 02:30:05,673
Karan!

2374
02:30:09,219 --> 02:30:10,345
Just leave me!

2375
02:30:11,221 --> 02:30:13,086
Just get...

2376
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:14,548
Zeisha!

2377
02:30:47,324 --> 02:30:49,519
Zeisha, shall we go?

2378
02:30:51,929 --> 02:30:52,987
Yeah.

2379
02:30:58,936 --> 02:31:01,564
Zeisha!

2380
02:31:02,606 --> 02:31:04,005
Hoshi's men.

2381
02:31:04,942 --> 02:31:06,204
Zeisha is leaving!

2382
02:31:06,276 --> 02:31:07,334
Zeisha!

2383
02:31:08,145 --> 02:31:09,669
Come with us to Dr. Hoshi!

2384
02:31:09,947 --> 02:31:11,005
Why?

2385
02:31:11,081 --> 02:31:12,946
Your uncle is waiting for you there!

2386
02:31:13,016 --> 02:31:14,074
What rubbish!

2387
02:31:14,151 --> 02:31:15,277
Zeisha!

2388
02:31:17,955 --> 02:31:20,014
Rahul! Thia! Where are you going?

2389
02:31:20,491 --> 02:31:21,958
We want to talk to our sister!

2390
02:31:23,494 --> 02:31:25,962
Right now Sec C needs us more!

2391
02:31:35,973 --> 02:31:37,031
Oh God!

2392
02:31:44,248 --> 02:31:45,374
Don't worry Sec C!

2393
02:31:46,049 --> 02:31:47,983
That's it! We need him alive!

2394
02:31:48,051 --> 02:31:50,918
Now Dr. Ya will handover the
time machine to Dr. Hoshi!

2395
02:31:55,125 --> 02:31:56,183
Let's go!

2396
02:31:56,927 --> 02:31:57,985
My God!

2397
02:31:58,061 --> 02:31:59,926
Are you fine?

2398
02:32:00,264 --> 02:32:02,926
Karan! Why are
Hoshi's men after you?

2399
02:32:03,133 --> 02:32:04,464
Uncle Ya...
- Karan!

2400
02:32:14,211 --> 02:32:18,147
'You know diary, Winkydinks says
that Karan had come to the station. '

2401
02:32:18,949 --> 02:32:20,473
'But why doesn't my heart agree? '

2402
02:32:22,152 --> 02:32:25,144
'Once! Just once, I
want to meet him. '

2403
02:32:26,957 --> 02:32:29,949
'I will just ask,
Karan are you fine? '

2404
02:32:30,227 --> 02:32:31,956
'Do you miss me?

2405
02:32:38,502 --> 02:32:40,970
Don't waste my time!

2406
02:32:41,004 --> 02:32:42,096
Where is it?

2407
02:32:42,172 --> 02:32:43,230
I won't tell you!

2408
02:32:43,307 --> 02:32:44,365
What will you do?

2409
02:32:44,441 --> 02:32:45,499
You will torture me!

2410
02:32:45,976 --> 02:32:48,570
What can be a bigger
torture than seeing your face!

2411
02:32:49,246 --> 02:32:51,976
Have you seen your face
in the mirror? It's awful!

2412
02:32:52,649 --> 02:32:54,378
You can give me shocks
as much as you want.

2413
02:32:54,451 --> 02:32:56,316
And I am not talking
about the electric shocks.

2414
02:32:56,386 --> 02:32:57,444
Just look, how my
hair has stood up due...

2415
02:32:57,521 --> 02:32:58,988
...all the electric shocks in my lab!

2416
02:33:07,598 --> 02:33:09,031
He won't tell us like this?

2417
02:33:09,233 --> 02:33:10,996
Bring Karan!

2418
02:33:11,034 --> 02:33:12,092
Get him!

2419
02:33:12,402 --> 02:33:13,994
With my hacking...

2420
02:33:14,037 --> 02:33:16,335
...I will show you such a way, that
will take you directly to uncle Ya!

2421
02:33:16,607 --> 02:33:17,665
How is that?

2422
02:33:18,008 --> 02:33:19,532
With Uncle Ya's ID!

2423
02:33:19,676 --> 02:33:21,610
Remember Q. T! I had embedded it!

2424
02:33:22,012 --> 02:33:23,479
And I already tracked it!

2425
02:33:23,547 --> 02:33:24,741
Dhinchak, we don't have much time!

2426
02:33:25,015 --> 02:33:26,539
The time machine
will leave on its own.

2427
02:33:27,017 --> 02:33:30,077
With or without us.

2428
02:33:30,153 --> 02:33:31,211
No problem!

2429
02:33:31,288 --> 02:33:34,280
This is the shortcut
to reach to uncle Ya!

2430
02:33:52,242 --> 02:33:53,300
Karan!

2431
02:33:53,577 --> 02:33:55,568
Karan! I had told you he will come!

2432
02:33:57,447 --> 02:33:58,505
Why are you hitting him?

2433
02:33:58,715 --> 02:34:00,046
What the hell do you want?

2434
02:34:00,117 --> 02:34:02,312
You know what Dr. Hoshi wants!

2435
02:34:05,188 --> 02:34:06,985
Or else we will kill him!

2436
02:34:07,057 --> 02:34:08,115
Stop!

2437
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:11,318
Stop!

2438
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:15,122
I will tell you where
the time machine is!

2439
02:34:17,234 --> 02:34:20,431
Off Marine Drive!
Hoshi Park! Section T!

2440
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:25,137
Dr. Khanna...

2441
02:34:25,742 --> 02:34:28,677
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

2442
02:34:33,417 --> 02:34:34,475
Karan!

2443
02:34:34,551 --> 02:34:35,609
I am Karan!

2444
02:34:38,422 --> 02:34:42,358
My little baby, he is confused!

2445
02:34:48,098 --> 02:34:50,157
The poor android!

2446
02:35:00,577 --> 02:35:05,310
ZXPD 450, waiting
for your orders, sir!

2447
02:35:05,649 --> 02:35:07,981
That face, is your target!

2448
02:35:08,652 --> 02:35:12,520
Scan it! Search it! Destroy it!

2449
02:35:32,008 --> 02:35:35,535
ZXPD 450 come on, hurry up!

2450
02:35:45,956 --> 02:35:47,150
Uncle Ya!

2451
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:37,598
Uncle Ya, you okay?

2452
02:36:38,074 --> 02:36:40,008
Karan, why did you come back?

2453
02:36:40,076 --> 02:36:41,134
Come back, I just arrived!

2454
02:36:47,150 --> 02:36:50,142
Machine 7. Lift no. 3. Go!

2455
02:36:52,289 --> 02:36:53,347
Come on, lets go.

2456
02:36:56,092 --> 02:36:57,559
Karan!
- Uncle Ya, take Rahul and Thia...

2457
02:36:59,696 --> 02:37:02,187
Target locked, attack and kill!

2458
02:37:02,299 --> 02:37:03,357
Damn you!

2459
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:04,958
Block all the exits!

2460
02:37:05,202 --> 02:37:06,464
Get me Dr. Khanna!

2461
02:37:41,004 --> 02:37:42,130
Q. T! Come in, Q. T!

2462
02:37:42,405 --> 02:37:43,599
Q. T! Q. T, where are you?

2463
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:44,998
Stay there, I am coming!

2464
02:38:22,245 --> 02:38:24,577
I am sorry sir! We
couldn't find the time machine!

2465
02:38:25,582 --> 02:38:27,447
Dr. Khanna!

2466
02:39:49,466 --> 02:39:54,028
I will take care of Dr.
Khanna and the time machine.

2467
02:39:56,940 --> 02:39:59,067
But you... are dead!

2468
02:41:49,452 --> 02:41:52,182
Zebelle! Look at what Q. T gave me!

2469
02:41:52,255 --> 02:41:53,449
It's so cute!

2470
02:41:54,924 --> 02:41:56,585
Winkydinks, do you
want to kiss Karan?

2471
02:41:56,659 --> 02:41:58,058
Yes!

2472
02:42:02,365 --> 02:42:04,265
Come on kids, hurry up!

2473
02:42:04,934 --> 02:42:06,424
But uncle...

2474
02:42:07,437 --> 02:42:09,598
Brother Karan...

2475
02:42:10,406 --> 02:42:12,601
Maybe he has gone to pick up Zeisha!

2476
02:42:12,942 --> 02:42:14,603
But what if he doesn't return?

2477
02:42:19,349 --> 02:42:23,945
Track Karan's air bike, he
will lead us to the time machine!

2478
02:42:26,089 --> 02:42:29,616
'Karan, are you sure you
don't want ice cream? - No. '

2479
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:32,551
'I won't share my ice cream. '

2480
02:42:32,629 --> 02:42:35,996
'We are going to share our entire
life, who cares about an ice cream! '

2481
02:42:36,166 --> 02:42:37,190
'Come on! '

2482
02:43:10,033 --> 02:43:11,125
Zeisha!

2483
02:43:21,678 --> 02:43:27,082
I had come to
change my fate in time.

2484
02:43:30,019 --> 02:43:33,216
But maybe, my
efforts weren't enough!

2485
02:43:34,557 --> 02:43:36,752
You don't even want to turn
around and look at me, Zeisha!

2486
02:43:42,198 --> 02:43:43,563
I have troubled you a lot, isn't it?

2487
02:43:45,969 --> 02:43:46,993
But what can I do, Zeisha!

2488
02:43:53,109 --> 02:43:54,235
For the last time!

2489
02:43:56,246 --> 02:43:58,111
Let me see you for the last time!

2490
02:43:58,248 --> 02:43:59,306
Just one last time.

2491
02:44:03,052 --> 02:44:04,246
I am going away, Zeisha!

2492
02:44:05,722 --> 02:44:08,122
So far away...
- Don't go far away Karan!

2493
02:44:15,999 --> 02:44:19,628
Because, there is
someone who will miss you!

2494
02:44:23,139 --> 02:44:24,265
Will miss you a lot!

2495
02:44:26,542 --> 02:44:27,600
Zeisha!

2496
02:44:28,344 --> 02:44:29,402
Sana!

2497
02:44:42,492 --> 02:44:44,084
Don't leave me behind, Karan!

2498
02:44:46,229 --> 02:44:50,563
We still we have one
ice cream left to share.

2499
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:51,692
Yeah!

2500
02:44:53,202 --> 02:44:55,397
A kiss from my cold lips.

2501
02:44:57,974 --> 02:44:59,498
And our entire life!

2502
02:45:00,643 --> 02:45:03,635
Sunshine! Sana!

2503
02:45:11,254 --> 02:45:12,312
Let's go!

2504
02:45:19,996 --> 02:45:21,054
Follow him!

2505
02:45:21,130 --> 02:45:23,121
He will lead us to the time machine!

2506
02:45:29,005 --> 02:45:30,199
We have only 9 minutes left!

2507
02:45:39,148 --> 02:45:41,013
We've traced the time machine.

2508
02:45:41,084 --> 02:45:42,073
Kill Karan!

2509
02:45:42,151 --> 02:45:43,948
Then the time machine is ours.
- Yes, sir.

2510
02:45:48,624 --> 02:45:49,682
Karan!

2511
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:05,302
Robot, you get him.

2512
02:46:06,109 --> 02:46:07,167
Yes, sir.

2513
02:46:11,114 --> 02:46:12,172
Oh no!

2514
02:46:24,460 --> 02:46:26,394
Q. T how much time do we have?

2515
02:46:26,462 --> 02:46:27,588
3 minutes.
- Damn!

2516
02:46:38,207 --> 02:46:39,265
Careful!

2517
02:46:47,016 --> 02:46:48,540
Hold me! We have to jump!

2518
02:46:50,486 --> 02:46:52,613
Now! Jump!

2519
02:47:05,101 --> 02:47:06,568
Only 90 second left!

2520
02:47:42,939 --> 02:47:45,533
Bye-bye 2050!

2521
02:47:45,608 --> 02:47:47,940
See you later!

2522
02:47:50,947 --> 02:47:52,005
Yeah!

2523
02:47:52,081 --> 02:47:53,946
Karan, Zeisha! Finally!

2524
02:47:54,016 --> 02:47:55,540
Come on, let's go! C'mon Sec C!

2525
02:47:55,685 --> 02:47:57,619
Q. T!
- 4...

2526
02:48:02,625 --> 02:48:05,958
3... 2... 1...

2527
02:48:23,646 --> 02:48:24,704
Q. T!

2528
02:48:25,314 --> 02:48:27,976
Welcome to the future!

2529
02:48:29,986 --> 02:48:31,044
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

2530
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:34,453
Can anybody watch a
movie without popcorn!

2531
02:48:34,524 --> 02:48:35,582
Wow!

2532
02:48:35,658 --> 02:48:36,989
Stop it!

2533
02:48:46,135 --> 02:48:48,228
Look at this!

2534
02:48:56,546 --> 02:48:57,604
Thank you God!

2535
02:48:58,948 --> 02:49:00,415
You brought my daughter back!

2536
02:49:06,355 --> 02:49:08,016
Only her hair has changed to red.

2537
02:49:09,091 --> 02:49:10,217
But what difference does it make?

2538
02:49:10,359 --> 02:49:11,951
She is my Sana!

2539
02:49:12,094 --> 02:49:14,221
You are very good, too much!

2540
02:49:14,297 --> 02:49:15,355
Just like me!

2541
02:49:15,965 --> 02:49:18,399
Pundit cum scientist, I
am very angry with you!

2542
02:49:18,501 --> 02:49:19,559
Ask why?
- Why?

2543
02:49:19,602 --> 02:49:22,093
When you left, why
didn't you take me along?

2544
02:49:22,371 --> 02:49:23,963
Then come on, let's go
in the time machine!

2545
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:25,098
Where?

2546
02:49:25,174 --> 02:49:28,041
In the time, where you
were Anarkali and I was Salim!

2547
02:49:28,244 --> 02:49:29,302
Forget it!

2548
02:49:29,378 --> 02:49:31,437
Sana's papa will not spare you!

2549
02:49:33,115 --> 02:49:35,515
I will, but I will
die with happiness!

2550
02:49:36,986 --> 02:49:38,510
I will get so much
freedom once she leaves.

2551
02:49:38,588 --> 02:49:40,180
You are just...

2552
02:49:40,456 --> 02:49:44,256
Listen, now it's time for the
children to be happy! - Why?

2553
02:49:45,194 --> 02:49:46,252
For what?

2554
02:49:46,329 --> 02:49:47,455
Try to understand!
- What?

2555
02:49:47,530 --> 02:49:48,588
Sunshine!

2556
02:49:49,131 --> 02:49:50,155
What say!

2557
02:49:52,935 --> 02:49:54,027
I hardly even know you!

2558
02:49:57,006 --> 02:50:01,272
Well, Karan Malhotra,
age 23 from Sydney! - Okay.

2559
02:50:01,344 --> 02:50:02,936
Current status single.

2560
02:50:07,083 --> 02:50:08,141
And waiting!

2561
02:50:10,953 --> 02:50:12,147
Say yes! Say yes!

2562
02:50:13,289 --> 02:50:15,018
Come on Karan, come on!

2563
02:50:15,157 --> 02:50:16,215
Yes!
