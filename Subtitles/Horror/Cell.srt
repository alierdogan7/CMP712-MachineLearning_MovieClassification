over there.

343
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:39,044
Okay, how about
that one?

344
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:41,246
Oh, that makes all the difference in the world.

345
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:46,618
(Clatters)

346
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:14,111
Oh, my God.
Oh, my.

347
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,366
Why don't you
take care of Alice?

348
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:39,368
<i>I'll get what we came for.</i>

349
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:59,220
<i>(Flies buzzing)</i>

350
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,693
Here, take this.

351
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:10,795
Uh-uh.

352
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,898
<i>(Cocks gun)</i>

353
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,733
- What?
- Look at you.

354
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:19,469
Yeah, basic training.
You never forget.

355
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,205
Grab some ammo.

356
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:29,211
Clay: <i>How do you load these things?</i>

357
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:31,112
You guys,
there's someone out here.

358
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:32,847
What?

359
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,882
He's by himself.

360
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:38,018
Close 'em.
Close the drapes.

361
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,053
(Swing squeaking)

362
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,824
Hey, are you okay?

363
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:53,798
Hello.

364
00:30:01,908 --> 00:30:03,307
Hello.

365
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,474
Kid.

366
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,510
- (Barking)
- (snarling)

367
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:09,511
Clay:
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

368
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:15,149
(Swing squeaking)

369
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,185
I guess they don't
all travel in flock--

370
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,258
<i>(growling, snarling)</i>

371

374
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:02,355
(cracks)

375
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:16,434
Fuck this.

376
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,236
(Gunshots)

377
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,109
Let's go.
Let's go.

378
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:33,439
(Clicking, screeching)

379
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,584
(whispers)
What the hell?

380
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:29,286
Tom: <i>Well,
it looks like when the sun goes down</i>

381
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:31,321
they're programmed
to pack it in.

382
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:33,122
It was like they all
did it together.

383
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:35,691
Like it was an automated
response or something.

384
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:38,760
You know what I don't get
is how they all knew

385
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:41,062
exactly where
we were that fast.

386
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:44,231
<i>I mean, it's not like they</i>
<i>were watching us or anything.</i>

387
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:46,299
Not with their own
eyes anyway.

388
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,401
Not with their own--

389
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:51,604
so you're saying when that kid saw us,
they all saw us?

390
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,272
How else do you
explain it?

391
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:55,507
- So now they're psychic?
- <i>Telepathic.</i>

392
00:34:55,509 --> 00:35:00,078
Like maybe the pulse
flows through them

393
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,480
like they're this big,
organic, you know, network.

394
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:05,382
Alice:
Like a hive mind.

395
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:08,485
(Chuckles)
Yeah.

396
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,552
Clay:
<i>You got anything better?</i>

397
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,556
<i>(Geese honking)</i>

398
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,279
Tom: What makes you think they're still there?

399
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:42,748
I mean, no matter what
or how it went down,

400
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,716
don't you think
they might have bailed?

401
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:47,652
Clay: If they're safe,
they would have left a message.

402
00:35:56,362 --> 00:36:00,397
Lost most of my money in the great collapse of '08.

403
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:05,301
And I lost my emotional stability
in the great divorce of '09.

404
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:07,436
(Chuckles)

405
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:10,372
You know, at the time,
I thought that was the end of the world.

406
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,507
- Whoa, what is that?
- <i>(Music playing)</i>

407
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:14,242
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

408
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:18,512
It's music.

409
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,690
Greetings, gentlemen.

410
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:34,460
Miss.
Welcome to Gaiten Academy.

411
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:38,730
If you folks need a place to stay for the night,
we have plenty of rooms.

412
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:41,499
The boys who didn't have
cell phones have all run off.

413
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,234
<i>The ones</i>
<i>who did have them--</i>

414
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:45,436
Oh, we know about that.

415
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:48,705
I'm Jordan.
I'm a scholarship boy.

416
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,207
- I lived in Holloway.
- Good for you, Jordan.

417
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,909
Yes, sir.
That's what the Head said, too.

418
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,544
Charles Ardai.
Headmaster.

419
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,747
Quite a problem these cell phones have caused now,
isn't it?

420
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,715
(Chuckles)

421
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:03,817
The devil's intercom
is what I used to call them.

422
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:06,486
Nice.
It's apt.

423
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:08,387
Clay:
What's with the music?

424
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,956
Did you ever play
musical chairs as a child?

425
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,892
- Yeah.
- Well, as long as the music doesn't stop,

426
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:16,494
we've got nothing
to worry about.

427
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:19,864
We'll have a quick peek,
then we'll go over to Cheatham Lodge for dinner.

428
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:23,234
It's not 200 yards to
Tonney Field, I promise.

429
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:27,637
<i>(Music continues)</i>

430
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:31,006
Alice:
<i>Holy shit.</i>

431
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:37,411
<i>Is the music coming</i>
<i>from their phones?</i>

432
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:39,379
Charles: <i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>they won't wake up.</i>

433
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:41,481
Tom: <i>How can you be so sure of that?</i>

434
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:45,350
Observe.

435
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:47,552
- What the hell are you doing?
- (Cocks gun)

436
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:49,620
Charles: No, no,
he's calm. He's calm.

437
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:52,856
<i>I could put my sword cane</i>
<i>right through his throat</i>

438
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:54,657
<i>and he wouldn't</i>
<i>try to stop me.</i>

439
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:57,660
Nor would those around him
spring to his defense.

440
00:37:57,662 --> 00:37:59,762
Of course, if I tried
it in the daylight,

441
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:01,630
they'd tear me limb
from limb.

442
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,832
The music comes from
their mouths, too.

443
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:06,401
It's not hardly a whisper,
but you can hear it.

444
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:11,972
- Come here.
- That's got to be your imagination.

445
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:14,274
- There's no way that they're actually talking.
- <i>Come listen.</i>

446
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:23,282
It's like
they don't breathe.

447
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:27,785
I can hear it.
I can hear it.

448
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:30,554
How is that even possible
without a transmitter?

449
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:34,391
They are transmitting.
It's a new skill they seem to have picked up.

450
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,626
And they're changing
at an alarming rate.

451
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:40,296
Alice: Can we please move this conversation inside?

452
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,064
Please.

453
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,536
Charles:
<i>We cannot overestimate</i>

454
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:50,804
<i>the developmental leaps</i>
<i>we're witnessing here.</i>

455
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:53,973
They appear
to be eusocial.

456
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:56,842
Like a colony
of bees or ants.

457
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:59,811
<i>They act for the good</i>
<i>of the group as a whole.</i>

458
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,513
There's no competitiveness,
no selfishness.

459
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:06,450
In fact,
they may be the next stage in human evolution.

460
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:09,019
Every human
on planet Earth

461
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:12,022
will be part
of one giant organism.

462
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:15,358
No individuality.
No privacy. Come on.

463
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,461
No war.
No resource depletion.

464
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:20,529
- No conflict.
- No, thank you.

465
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:23,899
<i>As to what they're doing at</i>
<i>night as they lie there so still,</i>

466
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:27,802
open-eyed and listening
to their music,

467
00:39:27,804 --> 00:39:29,370
we think
they're rebooting.

468
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:32,339
Yeah, I mean,
they might as well have

469
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:35,775
"software updating,
please stand by" blinking on their foreheads.

470
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:37,777
You mean they had
their brains wiped?

471
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:41,013
Yeah, I mean,
what is a brain?

472
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:43,815
It's just a big
old hard drive.

473
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,650
Organic circuitry.

474
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:47,551
<i>No one knows</i>
<i>how many bytes.</i>

475
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,920
<i>Like, giga to the power</i>
<i>of googolplex, let's say.</i>

476
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,922
<i>An infinity of bytes.</i>

477
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,457
<i>If your brain were an info strip on a hard drive,</i>

478
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:58,461
it would say something like
2 % in use, 98 % available.

479
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:00,729
Holmes, you astound me.

480
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,831
- I love cybernetics.
- Ah.

481
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,567
Cyberpunk fiction, too.
William Gibson.

482
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,101
Clay: <i>Neal Stephenson,</i>
<i>you like him?</i>

483
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,936
Neal Stephenson is a god.

484
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:10,370
Yeah, he's pretty good.

485
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:13,806
Right now
the nights are ours.

486
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:17,476
But what happens if they decide
that they need less sleep?

487
00:40:17,478 --> 00:40:21,613
<i>What happens if they decide to</i>
<i>grow against their digital lullabies?</i>

488
00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:23,948
What happens

489
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,617
when they're not
afraid of the dark?

490
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,518
What are you suggesting?

491
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,521
I think what's happening now is
more than temporary anarchy.

492
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:34,457
I think it's the start
of a war.

493
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:37,760
<i>It's going to be a short</i>
<i>but extremely nasty one.</i>

494
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:40,662
But what does one
do in a war?

495
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:42,797
One kills one's enemies.

496
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,565
Well, even with
the guns we have,

497
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,933
it'll be slow work.

498
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:49,102
We have a gasoline pump
in our little motor pool.

499
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:53,839
Gasoline may serve
to end their lives.

500
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:57,409
Hold up.
You want to napalm them?

501
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:59,444
<i>We have a sprayer truck</i>
<i>that we use</i>

502
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:02,413
to keep our playing
fields very green.

503
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,650
I want to wipe them out.

504
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:11,654
I agree with him.
I think we should wipe them out.

505
00:41:11,656 --> 00:41:13,656
<i>The ones</i>
<i>on the soccer field.</i>

506
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:15,557
<i>And I don't want to do it</i>
<i>for the human race.</i>

507
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,458
<i>I want to do it</i>
<i>for my mom.</i>

508
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,194
As many as we can,
as fast as we can.

509
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,832

On the wall.
You drew him.

687
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:05,038
I'm not the first guy to draw a devil on a piece of paper.

688
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,973
- Tom: <i>The devil?</i>
- Yeah.

689
00:56:08,943 --> 00:56:11,710
- How's it end?
- <i>I never finished it.</i>

690
00:56:11,712 --> 00:56:14,412
I mean, it's like
a serial graphic novel.

691
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:17,948
Didn't really end.
It was just a game and a story.

692
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,916
- Just a game?
- Mm.

693
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:24,553
Good always
conquers evil.

694
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:27,922
Now, I believe that.

695
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:31,325
<i>¶ So long</i>
<i>I've been saving ¶</i>

696
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:36,062
<i>¶ Tonight was made</i>
<i>for me and you ¶</i>

697
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:41,534

698
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:42,935

00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:49,874
<i>¶ Ring my bell ¶</i>

702
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:51,408
<i>¶ My bell... ¶</i>

703
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:03,085
You know, and I saw you
with your son once, too.

704
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,621
And I always wanted that.

705
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:11,893
Anyway, I saw you leave your
apartment with that woman

706
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,495
and I just really
hated that.

707
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,563
- <i>Liz?</i>
- Liz.

708
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:18,665
Hated that.

709
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,500
Always seemed like
you were pissed at me.

710
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:23,202
I never knew
what was up with you.

711
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,170
You'd give me
that death stare.

712
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:27,038
(Chuckles)

713
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,773
Yeah.

714
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,674
I give everyone
the death stare.

715
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:37,646
But I know you
love your family.

716
00:57:37,648 --> 00:57:39,114
I've seen you
with your son

717
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:41,783
and I know that shit
happens with couples,

718
00:57:41,785 --> 00:57:43,784
just--

719
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:49,122
You're gonna
find him, Clay.

720
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,058
You're gonna find him.

721
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,793
You think?

722
00:57:55,163 --> 00:57:57,062
You are.

723
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,833
<i>We were traveling</i>
<i>in the dark</i>

724
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:04,502
<i>and that was really,</i>
<i>really dark for me.</i>

725
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:07,137
'Cause I had him.
And I had her.

726
00:58:10,108 --> 00:58:13,809
I had some bullshit job
that I hated

727
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:17,479
doing graphic design
for some stupid company.

728
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:21,249
<i>But I hated myself for not having</i>
<i>the balls to do what I wanted</i>

729
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:25,820
and I hated Sharon for loving me when I hated myself

730
00:58:25,822 --> 00:58:28,889
and all these warped,
convoluted feelings.

731
00:58:32,194 --> 00:58:34,194
Sometimes
I'd get home from work

732
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:36,663
and I'd change into
my rock and roll T-shirt

733
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:39,632
and I'd go to the bar and smoke weed
and listen to Norwegian death metal

734
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:42,901
like some teenager who wanted
to blow up his high school.

735
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:45,136
It was pathetic.

736
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:49,773
Then one day I just split
and moved out.

737
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:52,108
And do you
like being there?

738
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,610
First night I was there,
I knew it was a mistake.

739
00:58:54,612 --> 00:58:56,511
Very first night.

740
00:58:59,682 --> 00:59:01,948
I called Sharon
the day of the Pulse.

741
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,917
I couldn't tell her
I missed her

742
00:59:04,919 --> 00:59:06,551
and that I wanted
to come home.

743
00:59:06,553 --> 00:59:09,654
I said I want
to see my son.

744
00:59:09,656 --> 00:59:13,290
See, I had to prove I was right and
to prove I was special, you know?

745
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:16,893
I mean,
probably just wanted her to be proud of you.

746
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:24,800
Well, be great
if that were true.

747
00:59:24,802 --> 00:59:26,301
I think I was
just an asshole.

748
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:33,608
<i>Here.</i>
<i>That's what you look like.</i>

749
00:59:34,978 --> 00:59:37,645
Human beings are the religion of the angels.

750
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:41,115
And that is an angel in exile.
What do you think?

751
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:01,633

We can build a bird.

We can make
a snowman.

01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:03,902
Or we could play
the slinky one.

The Head said
this would happen.

798

He also said they'd find new ways
of maintaining their numbers.

799

You saw what happened
back there, right?

they're recruiting.

This young lady here,
Denise Link from Haverhill, neighboring town.

812
01:06:26,064 --> 01:06:27,930
Meetcha.

813
01:06:27,932 --> 01:06:30,065
Ray: <i>But our names don't actually matter anymore.</i>

814
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:32,934
What matters-- what matters is what we do.

815
01:06:32,936 --> 01:06:36,570
And what we do, hmm?
We kill phone freaks.

816
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:39,171
Yeah, yeah,
we kill them.

817
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,273
Just like you.

818
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:46,376
Denise:
<i>The second time in Nashua,</i>

819
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:48,578
<i>we used dynamite from</i>
<i>a construction site shed.</i>

820
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,380
<i>Ray knew how to rig the dynamite</i>
<i>from when he worked on a road crew.</i>

821
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,182
Ray: That's when we started
seeing those Kashwak No-Fo signs.

822
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:55,917
Denise: <i>Kashwak.</i>
<i>They're telling people</i>

823
01:06:55,919 --> 01:06:57,685
<i>it's a no-phone zone,</i>
<i>but that's a lie.</i>

824
01:06:57,687 --> 01:07:00,320
The area got an Indian
casino built there last year

825
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:02,422
and finally put up
a cell phone tower.

826
01:07:02,424 --> 01:07:05,224
The phoners are trying to draw us there in our dreams,
but it's a trap.

827
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:08,193
Ray: <i>Yeah,
and the dreams started coming after we blasted.</i>

828
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,562
I mean, we blasted.
That first flock, we blasted them.

829
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:13,998
- You know, powerful dreams. Powerful dreams, like--
- Tom: We've had them.

<i>The phoner in the red hoodie.</i>

<i>They'll quit.</i>

<i>But it's not gonna be easy.</i>
<i>Know why?</i>

841
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,755
<i>Know why?</i>
<i>'Cause they get inside of people's minds.</i>

They get inside
of people's minds.

843
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,757

She sleeps in there,
I'm out here guarding.

848
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:55,431
I'll pace all night.
I'll be all over this park.

849
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:57,833
- Mary had a little lamb. She's my Mary.
- Aw.

850
01:07:57,835 --> 01:08:00,101
- <i>It's not my kid. Not my kid.</i>
- Denise: <i>No.</i>

851
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:02,069
Ray: <i>But she's my Mary.</i>
<i>I'm looking after her.</i>

852
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:04,404
That's great.
Sounds like you guys are in a good place.

853
01:08:04,406 --> 01:08:06,305
Oh, yeah.

854
01:08:06,307 --> 01:08:09,107
But you know what?
We can resist as long as we stay awake.

855
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:12,610
Staying awake is key.
We just stay away from the flocks.

856
01:08:12,612 --> 01:08:14,745
How you plan
on doing that?

857
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:18,381
Ray: <i>Oh, we got ourselves a canary in a coal mine,
my friend.</i>

858
01:08:18,383 --> 01:08:22,351
Hey, Denise, you want to show them and
I'll finish cooking the burgers with your son?

859
01:08:25,122 --> 01:08:27,489
Denise: <i>My brother's doing more to help me out now</i>

860
01:08:27,491 --> 01:08:29,657
<i>than he ever did</i>
<i>when he was human.</i>

861
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:32,226
I still hate
to see him like this.

862
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:35,228
- He's a phoner?
- Yup.

863
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,863
<i>Yeah, he's like</i>
<i>a little calf</i>

864
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:40,632
that broke off from
the herd and got lost.

865
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:42,567
On its own, he's nothing.

866
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:45,703
He just sits here and waits for
them to come back and find it

867
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,204
or else he dies.

868
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,673
God, he hasn't
been eating.

869
01:08:50,675 --> 01:08:52,574
Come on,
don't do this to me.

870
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:55,810
If a flock passes
within a mile or so,

871
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:58,846
he starts coming to
and acting up.

872
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:01,648
The closer they are,
the crazier he gets.

873
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:03,716
That's why we got
him covered up.

874
01:09:03,718 --> 01:09:06,652
We don't want him showing them where
we are and bringing them down on us.

875
01:09:06,654 --> 01:09:10,188
<i>(Sighs) Come on,</i>
<i>don't do this to me.</i>

876
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:12,857
(Sighs)

877
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:16,726
Sometimes I think he can
still recognize my voice.

878
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:22,364
- You think they can be rehabbed?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

879
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,733
Johnny's voice: Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?

880
01:09:24,735 --> 01:09:27,135
- Tom: What the hell's going on?
- Are you coming home?

881
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:29,604
I have no idea.
He never said anything before.

882
01:09:29,606 --> 01:09:31,606
<i>Are you coming home?</i>
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

883
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:33,708
Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?

884
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,376
<i>I just want you</i>
<i>to come home.</i>

885
01:09:35,378 --> 01:09:36,810
- That's Johnny's voice.
- No, it's not.

886
01:09:36,812 --> 01:09:38,745
<i>I just want</i>
<i>you to come home.</i>

887
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:40,513
- Tom: <i>Do not listen to that shit.</i>
- Are you coming home?

888
01:09:40,515 --> 01:09:42,715
You know
that is not your son.

889
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,917
- <i>Clay, no!</i>
- Hi, Dad.

890
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:48,320

- Denise: <i>No! No! No!</i>

891
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:50,355
Tom: <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

892
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:52,557
- <i>He was my brother.</i>
- <i>He saw us, that means they saw us.</i>

893
01:09:52,559 --> 01:09:54,492
He'll lead the rest of them to us.
Come on.

894
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:56,293
Ray: <i>Hey,
we all need to go now.</i>

895
01:09:56,295 --> 01:09:57,894
- Tom: <i>Come on.</i>
- Ray: <i>Everybody to the truck.</i>

896
01:09:57,896 --> 01:09:59,729
<i>Clay, come on.</i>

897
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,935
<i>(Engine stops)</i>

898
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,477
Why are we
stopping, Ray?

899
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:35,654
Ray: <i>No, it's too late for me.</i>
<i>It's too late for me because they're in my head.</i>

900
01:11:35,656 --> 01:11:38,256
At first it was in my dreams,
but now I'm seeing stuff when I'm awake.

901
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:40,825
Things that aren't there.
(Screams)

902
01:11:40,827 --> 01:11:43,694
You haven't slept for a week.
Maybe you were hallucinating.

903
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:45,662
I'm hallucinating because that asshole in the red hoodie

904
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:47,296
is putting thoughts
in my mind.

905
01:11:47,298 --> 01:11:48,664
And what the Prez wants,
he's not gonna get

906
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,465
because you're
not gonna let him.

907
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:52,633
They thought it was me,
but it wasn't me.

908
01:11:52,635 --> 01:11:54,468
It wasn't me, it's you.
He was wrong.

909
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,770
<i>You're the man, my artist.</i>
<i>You are it.</i>

910
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,605
What's that around
your neck, Ray?

911
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,006
I don't like it that you're
holding on to your kid

912
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:01,907
because your kid is done.
Your kid is done.

913
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:04,342
You know it in your heart
that your kid is toast.

914
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:06,043
- Your kid is toast.
- No, I don't.

915
01:12:06,045 --> 01:12:08,512
I don't know that.

916
01:12:08,514 --> 01:12:11,548
(Groans)

917
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,016
Oh!

918
01:12:13,018 --> 01:12:15,618
Here. Here.

919
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,520
I'm passing the torch.
I'm passing it on to you.

920
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:23,691
When the time comes,
call the number on the slip.

921
01:12:23,693 --> 01:12:25,659
You'll know the time.
I hope you know the time.

922
01:12:25,661 --> 01:12:28,395
- What time is that, Ray?
- The end of the road time.

923
01:12:28,397 --> 01:12:30,997
The end of the road.
Mmm.

924
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:34,567
No other options.

925
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:38,404

This is gonna blow my mind.
You better step away, my friend.

- Okay. Hold on.

No, no, no, no.

935
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:03,147
No, no, no.
Just stay with them.

936
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:05,149

Did you know
there was a bomb in here?

01:21:38,402 --> 01:21:41,102
No, or I wouldn't
have ridden in it.

977
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:45,172
So did Ray tell you
this thing was full of C-4?

978
01:21:45,174 --> 01:21:47,874
There's enough plastique in there
to blow up this whole fucking block.

Did you not hear
what Denise said?

984
01:22:03,088 --> 01:22:04,487
It's a trap.
We've been through this.

It's a suicide mission.
You're gonna die.

You remember the story
of Orpheus, buddy?

1004
01:22:50,623 --> 01:22:54,024
Orpheus traveled
to the underworld

1005
01:22:54,026 --> 01:22:57,626
to find his loved one,
bring them back to Earth.

1006
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:02,564
You're not Orpheus.

1007

Take care
of yourself, brother.

1008
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:05,599
