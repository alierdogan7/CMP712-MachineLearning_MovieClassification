I just need weapons, that's it.

180
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,897
So, please, lay down
your crossbow.

181
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:06,676
Back up.

182
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,820
- Sorry about this.
- <i> (walker snarling)</i>

183
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,756
You look tough.

184
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,492
You'll be all right.

185

<i>(chains rattle)</i>

189
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:53,160
Three bullets.

190
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:56,096
We're in the middle of a city.
He was stealing our weapons.

191
00:25:58,703 --> 00:26:01,137
Did you think
I was gonna kill him?

192
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,139
I was aiming for his leg.

193
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:06,874
Could that have killed him?
Maybe, I don't know.

194
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:08,808
But he was stealing our weapons.

195
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,511
He's a damn kid.

196
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:13,546
Without weapons we could die.

197
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:15,448
Beth could die.

198
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,852
We'll find more weapons.

199
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:21,919
I don't want you to die.
I don't want Beth to die.

200
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:23,587
I don't want anybody
at the church to die,

201
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:26,792
but I can't stand around
and watch it happen either.

202
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,394
I can't.
That's why I left.

203
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:31,229
I just had to be somewhere else.

204
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:34,232
Well, you ain't somewhere
else; you're right here.

205
00:26:34,234 --> 00:26:35,833
Tryin'.

206
00:26:38,604 --> 00:26:41,108
Look, you're not who you
were and neither am I.

(exhales)

208
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:47,211
I don't know if I believe
in God anymore or heaven,

209
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:49,882
but if I'm going to hell,
I'm making damn sure

210
00:26:49,884 --> 00:26:51,850
I'm holding it off
as long as I can.

Yeah, I see 'em.

223
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:10,272
- We have to go.
- GMH, what's that? A hospital?

224
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:12,076
I don't know.
Grady Memorial, maybe?

225
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:14,280
Grady, the white crosses-- it

How bad is it?

247
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,640
I've had worse.

Damn, that was stupid.

00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:29,885
There's only three blocks
between us and Grady.

252
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:35,156
We need to find a place nearby,

253
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:37,494
scope it out,
see what we can see.

254
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:42,534
You really think we're gonna
find out what we need to know

255

just by watching?

256
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:47,572

All right.

264
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,574
You said I ain't like
how I was before?

265
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,876
Yeah.

266
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:56,744
How was I?

267
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:01,454

Now you're a man.

269
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:11,233
What about you?

270
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,677
Me and Sophia stayed at that
shelter for a day and a half

271
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,012
before I went
running back to Ed.

272
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:31,047
I went home, I got
beat up, life went on,

273
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:37,088
and I just kept praying
for something to happen.

274
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,293
But I didn't do anything.

275
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:42,961
Not a damn thing.

she got burned away.

278

I mean, not happy, but...

00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:58,144
And at the prison

280
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:02,979
I got to be who I always
thought I should be,

thought I should've been.

282
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:10,887
And then she got burned away.
