00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,159
(Whistling)

2
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,999
Child: (Muffled) Mum!

3
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,599
(Creaking)

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,519
(Groaning)

5
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,199
Child: Mum!

6
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,079
(Screech of metal,
glass shattering)

7
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,479
Mummy!

8
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,999
Mum!

9
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,359
(Clearer) Mum!

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,479
I had the dream again.

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,799
(Reads) "And he climbed down
that chimney,

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,079
"straight into
the huge black pot.

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,159
"And that was the end of
the big, bad wolf."

14
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,039
Did they really kill the wolf,
mum?

15
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,519
I'm sure they did.
