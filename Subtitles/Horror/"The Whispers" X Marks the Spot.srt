00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,747
But mommy got mad and said
I couldn't play anymore.

2
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:26,751
I said it was an accident,
but she didn't believe me.

3
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,587
If daddy was home, he would have listened,

4
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:32,590
but daddy's gone. Daddy's<i> always</i> gone.

5
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,843
Mommy says his job is very important.

6
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,512
He's a scientist. He looks at stuff.

7
00:00:38,563 --> 00:00:41,682
I can't remember what now,
but he said when I'm older

8
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,019
he'll show me the funny-looking buildings.

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,906
No, I can do it... I promise!

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,355
Amanda: Harper, time to get out
of those wet clothes.

11
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:54,192
No, I don't want to! I'm still
learning all the rules!

12
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:56,027
Who are you talking to?

13
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:59,197
A friend.

[Chuckles]

15
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,701
- What's your friend's name?
- Drill.

16
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,537
That's an interesting name.

17
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:09,540
Do you think Drill would like
to join us for lunch?

18
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,542
[Whispering]

19
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:14,545
He said that would be very amenable to him.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,048
"Amenable." Okay.

21
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:24,138

22
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,807

No, just some interference.

So, Harper has a new friend.

34
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,783
He's what you might call imaginary.

35
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,068
I know. Adorable, right?

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,287
I wonder why some kids
have them and others don't.

37
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:20,241
Yes!

I remember.

41
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:28,466
Yeah, he flew out this morning.

42
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,818
One of the reactors was having problems.

43
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:33,588
- [Thud]
- Oh, my God.

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,223
Harper? What happened?

45
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:37,559
I'm okay!

46
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,596
No.

47
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,598
Oh, yeah, just Harper playing.

48
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:45,266
Um, I got to go, Liz, okay?

49
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,934
I'll call you back later?

50
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:49,153
- Okay.

This isn't funny! Where are you?!

57
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:19,133
I'm here! Hi, mommy!

58
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,636
You know you're not allowed
up there without me!

59
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:22,804
It isn't safe!

60
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:25,690
I tried calling you,
but you weren't listening.

61
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,859
You're always talking on the phone, mommy.

62
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:31,145
That's no excuse! Come down now!

63

She's coming.

68

Harper.

Who are you talking to?

70
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:54,669
You know, Drill,

71
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,337
but you're not allowed to talk to him.

72
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,505
He says you're "it."

73
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:58,672
Well, tell him

74
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,841
I'm not in the mood to talk to him either.

75
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,009
Now let's go.

76
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,894

You're supposed to step on it.

Why aren't you playing, mommy?

82
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,574
You don't want me to win?

83
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,691
Okay, okay.

84
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:20,778
I'll step on it, and then we go down, okay?

it's something for the locals.

122

123
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,663

Agent Rollins,
this is our child specialist.

00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,061
- Agent Bennigan.
- Hello.

160
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,762
Your reputation precedes you.

Alex: The crime scene...

162
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,100

with the tree house.

163
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,402
Please sit.

164
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:30,776
Claire: You're telling me a
6-year-old did this by herself?

165
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:31,827
You know kids these days.

166
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:33,329
Probably learned it on the Internet.

167
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:35,614
Clearly you don't have kids, Agent Rollins.

168
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,333
Has she said anything?

169
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:39,835
We were waiting for your expertise.

170
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,171
You guys don't have a lot of time.

171
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,923
The grandmother has given us
permission to question the girl,

172
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,125
but the dad's on his way
back from a trip, so...

173
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,793
Let's get started.

174
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:53,766
Rollins, a word, please?

175
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,102
Sir.

176
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,772
I know there's some talk going
around about Agent Bennigan.

177
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,640
I'm gonna take a guess and say

178
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,642
it's the same folks talking about you.

179
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,361
Two disciplinary actions will

180
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:07,029
- do that around here.
- Sir...

181
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,814
and for God's sake,
she just lost her husband.

182
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:11,483
So do me the courtesy

360
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:52,030
why an unauthorized American military plane

361
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:53,815
would be found within our borders.

362
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:57,485
You know I can't answer these questions.

363
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,487
This isn't a special projects affair.

364
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:02,040
This is air force. Why did you call me?

365
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:03,792
Unfortunately, there's more.

366
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:06,728
I... [Electricity crackling]

367
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,797
It's happening again.

368
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,167
[Indistinct shouting]

369
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:14,135

[Electricity crackling]

372
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:27,515
What's going on here?

373
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,817
I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Karif.

374
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:32,187
He's a geologist
from the University of Algeria.

375
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:35,323
Why is a geologist interested
in a crashed fighter plane?

376
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,824
He's not interested in your plane.

377
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,660
There's something else we need to show you.

378
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,662
But first, we need to suit up.

379
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:43,197
[Indistinct shouting continues]

380
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:02,350
[Wes breathing heavily]

381
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,813
What is that thing?

382
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,042
Wes.

383
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:28,390
[Electricity crackles]

384
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,225
- [Rumbling]
- [Groans]

385
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:37,182
Electricity from the plane

386
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,411
trapped inside the rocks somehow.

387
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,531
It seems to be affecting
the current from our light.

388
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,727
- Any idea how long it's been here?
- We questioned some nomads

389
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,743
who passed through the area
four months ago.

390
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:47,077
Nothing was here then.

391
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,080
Unfortunately, that's the best
timeline we have.

392
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,871
The plane...

393
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,487
Looks like it never
touched the ground here.

394
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,535
You're saying it did not crash?

395
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,705
I'm saying it looks like it was

396
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:11,191
grabbed from the sky and ripped to shreds.

397
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,460
By what?

398
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:32,395
Or by who?

399
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:38,518
So, what are they saying?

400
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,404
- Excuse me?
- [Bells tolling]

401
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,239
The office. What are they saying about me?

402
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:44,824
Listen, I'm sorry about your husband.

403
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,326
I should have said something before.

404
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,995
That's not what people
are talking about, is it?

405
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:53,867
Let's just say it hasn't
escaped people's attention

406
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:55,535
that you took your leave of absence

407
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:57,036
before your husband died,

408
00:21:57,087 --> 00:21:59,372
the same time the assistant director did.

409
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:01,374
There are those who don't think
that's a coincidence.

410
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:04,377
How about you? What do you think?

411
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:08,131
I think marriage is complicated.

412
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:12,218
How long have you been divorced?

413
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,554
Technically, not.

414
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,492
Becomes official next month.

415
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:21,477
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

416
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:24,831
Well... Happens.

417
00:22:26,633 --> 00:22:29,268
- Said you had a son?
- Yeah.

418
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:30,903
Henry.

419
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:34,457
How's he handling everything?

420
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:37,827
Two years ago, he got sick.
He lost his hearing.

421
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:41,814
Three months ago, he lost his dad, so...

422
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:45,485
How do you think he's handling everything?

423
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:48,971
Agents Rollins and Bennigan?

424
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:51,641
I can let you see her now.

425
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:56,812
Ms. Bellings?

426
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:59,765
My name is Claire Bennigan.
I'm with the FBI.

427
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:03,202
I'm sorry to do this, but I need
to ask you about your son.

428
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:09,659
This morning, a little girl
tried to hurt her mother.

429
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,410
She said she was playing a game.

430
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:27,793
"You'll get through this."

431
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:30,679
That's what people say, don't they?

432
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:35,017
They said it to me.
It really pissed me off.

433
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:40,356
What exactly does it mean
to "get through this"?

434
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,860
Through what? What's on the other side?

435
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:48,530
I didn't want to get through it.

436
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:52,651
I wanted to die... In it.

437
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:58,824
And then my mom,
she said that grief is like

438
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:02,461
a suitcase that sits
at the bottom of your bed.

439
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:04,630
And no matter what, without fail,

440
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:08,500
you have it pick it up
every day, take it with you.

441
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:11,336
Some days, it will be filled with rocks,

442
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:14,840
and you won't think you can carry it.

443
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:17,509
And then other days...

444
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,346
Light as a feather.

445
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:26,568
That, she said, is "getting through it."

446
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,522
It made sense to me.

447
00:24:33,526 --> 00:24:37,412
My husband was killed three
months ago in a plane crash.

448
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,414
I'm sorry.

449
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:40,832
And I'd be lying

450
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,501
if I said I knew
what you were going through.

451
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:45,837
I don't. I have my son.

452
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:49,424
I can't imagine what
I'd be like if I lost him.

453
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:53,545
Well, you're looking at it.

[Indistinct talking over P.A.]

457
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:08,610
He was found this morning
unconscious in an alleyway.

458
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:10,228
No ID.

459
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,148
[Whispering continues]

460
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:19,070
That part... Something about "time,"

461
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:20,405
something like "it's too late."

462
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:22,324
- Too late for what?
- I'm not sure.

463
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:24,809
"Lights."

464
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:27,629
"Searching for lights."

465
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:31,082
He's saying, "it's too late."

466
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,918
They're searching for the lights."

467
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:34,252
What does it mean?

468
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:37,422
[Chuckles] You're asking me?

469
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:40,592
What happened that day at Westings?

470
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:46,398
That day [exhales sharply] I went to work.

471
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:48,900
I supposed Jackson was at school.

472
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:51,736
But when I got up from my desk
to go to the bathroom,

473
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:54,572
there he was in the hall.

474
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:57,359
I said, "Jackson, what are you doing here?"

475
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,846
And he said, "mom,
I think I'm doing a bad thing."

476
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:05,333
I don't think this is a game."

477
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:08,002
And before I could ask him what he meant,

478
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:10,672
he ran into the supply closet.

479
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:13,374
And the next thing I knew...

480
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:16,961
[Breathes deeply]

481
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:19,597
Did he ever tell you about
his friend, Drill?

482
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:22,100
Yes, he tried.

483
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:25,103
When I found out
Drill wasn't real, I got mad.

484
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:26,437
[Sniffles]

485
00:26:26,472 --> 00:26:29,140
I told him he was too old
for that kind of stuff.

486
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:32,477
You should have seen the look on his face.

487
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,031
Someone is behind Drill.

488
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:39,884
Wait.

489
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,153
You think Drill is real?

490
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:43,655
We have to find this person.

491
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,873
Is there anything
that you remember, anyone?

492
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:51,996
What?

493
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:54,665
There was someone across the street.

494
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,835
A-a man watching the building,

495
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,004
like he was waiting for something.

496
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:01,589
Can you describe this man?

497
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,343
His eyes...

498
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:07,678
it was like there was nothing there.

499
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,817
He had all these tattoos.

500
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:15,653
His body was covered with them.

501
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:20,324
We need a sketch artist ASAP.

502
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,027
Your son.

503
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:25,730
Hold on to him.

504
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:27,865
Don't let him go.

- It's okay. It's okay.

- I need assistance here!

Come back.

00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:51,438
That's good. That's good.

513
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:52,690
I'm Dr. Maria Benavidez.

514
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:56,227
You're at Capitol University Hospital.

515
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:58,562
Get resident back. I need him to translate.

516
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:00,898
It's okay.

517
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:03,234
I don't know.

518
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:05,569
- I don't know.
- You speak english?

519
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,240
We want to help you, okay?

520
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:12,243
In order to do that,
we need to know your name.

521
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:13,377
What's your name?

522
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,713
My name?

523
00:28:17,882 --> 00:28:21,502
I don't know.

524
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:23,504
I don't know.

525
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,904
Lena: Hey, Minx. Tell me what
happened on the playground.

526
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:32,089
- Why was that boy so scared?
- I don't know.

527
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:34,839
- Probably 'cause he's turning.
- What does that mean?

528
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,007
You're not gonna understand, mommy.

529
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:41,539
- You're old.
- Okay.

00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:45,710
Try me. I might surprise you.

532
00:28:45,712 --> 00:28:48,046
When a kid gets old, they turn.

533
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:50,381
And they think about stuff too much.

534
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:51,683
And that's a bad thing?

535
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:53,718
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, what about you? Are you turning?

536

No.

00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:58,056
My friend says I'm never gonna turn.

538
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:00,892
He thinks I'm special.

539
00:29:00,943 --> 00:29:04,362
Oh, Minx, that is incredible.

540
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:06,364
I did it all by myself.

541
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,700
Well, mostly. My friend,
he helped a little.

542
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,035
What's that?

543
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,905
That's where the light comes from.

544
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:17,241
Your dad is gonna love this.

545
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:20,077
No, I don't think he'll care.

546
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:21,712
Daddy doesn't like us.

547
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:23,297
What are you talking about?

548
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:25,800
Your dad loves us.

549
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,802
That's not what my friend told me.

550
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:29,754
He said that daddy did a bad thing.

551
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:31,923
You're still mad,

552
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:34,258
even though you pretend not to be.

553
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:41,983
Okay, Minx, I'm gonna
have to meet this friend.

554
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:43,985
You will, I promise.

555
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,488
But first, I got to go to the bathroom.

556

Wes, you need to call me right away.

560
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:58,282
Minx knows.

561
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,952
She knows... What you did.

562
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:03,454

- Told you, mommy.

00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,506
[Gasps]

564
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,792
You scared me.

565
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:10,294
Daddy doesn't want to talk to you.

566
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:14,798

567

- Peter: Wes!
- [Beep]

568
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:18,969
You got to take a look at this.

569
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,137
So, that F-22?

570
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:21,972
- Mm-hmm.
- 94th fighter squadron.

571
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:23,974
Three months ago, it was sent out

572
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:25,809
on a classified surveillance run.

573
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:27,444
The mission was to gather
photographic evidence

574
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,813
of Chinese and Russian military
buildup in the arctic circle.

575
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,649
- Mm-hmm.
- But get this.

576
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,318
As soon as the pilot reached its target,

577
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,786
he radioed in he was losing control.

578
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,788
Two minutes later,
the plane disappeared off radar.

579
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:39,790
The arctic circle? You're sure?

580
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:41,125
Yeah, that's what it says.

581
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,993
That's... that's almost 4,000
miles away from the wreckage.

582
00:30:43,044 --> 00:30:44,662
And according to the fuel log here,

583
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:46,880
the plane took off with only
300 miles worth of fuel.

584
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:48,715
So no way it could have made it
to that desert on its own.

585
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,384
No.

586
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,005
The pilot.

587
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:57,374
What?

588
00:30:57,392 --> 00:31:00,060
I know him.

589
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:01,395
So, nothing?

590
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,480
No name, no home, no memory?

591
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:04,515
Is that what you're saying?

592
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:06,016
It's all fuzzy.

593

594
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:11,388
It's like it's there,
just I can't reach it.

595
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,907
- But I've been having these dreams.
- Uh-huh.

596
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:17,361
I don't know what they mean,
but they're important.

597
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:18,745
I know,

598
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,399

While you were out,

601
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,958
you were saying something in Arabic.

602
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:33,961
You said... It's not possible.
I don't speak Arabic.

603
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:35,629
But we heard you.

604
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,298
We even had someone come and translate.

605
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:40,634
So what did I say?

606
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:41,968
"It's too late.

607
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020

609
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:49,226
No.

610
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:51,611
Okay, I'm gonna order a C.T. scan,

611
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:53,947
and hopefully it will tell us something.

No, my mom's here. She's not feeling well.

she can help you, okay?

Please, I don't understand.
You need to explain.

718
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:42,797
- I don't un...
- I'm sorry.

719
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:44,632
- I have to go.
- [Beep]

720
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:47,135
[Gasps]

721
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:55,510
[Breathing heavily]

722
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:11,326
uh, uh...

723
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,837
[Sighs]

724
00:39:29,094 --> 00:39:32,213
<i>So, Wes, what in the hell am I looking at?</i>

725
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:34,215
A fulgurite.

726
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,584
Sometimes known as "petrified lightning."

727
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:39,053
It happens when large bursts
of energy hit the sand.

728
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:40,888
<i>And you thought it was necessary
to pull me out of a meeting...</i>

729
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,524
Sir, this is what
a traditional sample looks like.

730
00:39:45,477 --> 00:39:47,945
And this is what we found
at the crash site.

731
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,783
<i>So the heat from</i>
<i>the plane's impact created...</i>

732
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:53,951
No, I had my team run that scenario.

733
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:55,754
There's, uh, nowhere near enough
energy to make that happen.

734
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,955
- <i>So what do you propose did?</i>
- I don't know.

735
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,375
A weapons test from a rogue state.

736
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,777
<i>The locals, n... No one's talking,</i>
<i>no one saw anything?</i>

737
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:06,047
Well, I believe someone did.

738
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:07,131
<i>Well, who?</i>

739
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:08,799
Whoever left these.

740
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:14,972
<i>How could anyone have survived that crash?</i>

741
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,674
I agree, sir.

742
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:17,975
But I'd like to stay and run some tests

743
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,894
on Captain Bennigan's plane.

744
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:25,499
<i>Come home, Wes.</i>

745
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,987
- But, sir...
- <i>That's an order.</i>

746
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:32,323
<i>Come home.</i>

747
00:40:32,357 --> 00:40:35,493
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

748
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:37,661
[Crickets chirping]

749
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:40,164
[Wind blowing]

750
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:47,822
[Dog barking in distance]

751
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:50,624
[Train whistle blows in distance]

752
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,959
[Car alarm chirps]

753
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:53,794
I can't believe it.

754
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:56,130
[Train whistle blows in distance]

755
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,800
This is the best present
in the whole wide world.

756
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:02,803
Thank you for fixing me.

757
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:06,307
[Whispering]

758
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:08,309
Okay.

759
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:10,811
I promise.

760
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:13,814
It'll be our little secret.

761
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:19,653
Goodnight, Drill.

762
00:41:19,704 --> 00:41:21,322
I love you.

763
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:24,024
