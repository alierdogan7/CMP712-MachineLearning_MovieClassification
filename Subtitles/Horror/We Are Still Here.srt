Probably another hour or so.

4
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,312
Everything should be there.

5
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:54,980
The movers were
working all week,

6
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,249
putting all the rooms together.

7
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:03,455
How did they know
where to hang the photos?

8
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,590
I told them.

9
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,392
If something's in the
wrong place, we'll fix it.

10
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,365
We'll fix it.

11
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,631

Paul?

16
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,890
Are you up?

17
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,594
[distant door slamming]

18
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,766
Paul?

00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,062
Thank you.

28
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:52,677
I can feel him here.

29
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,813
What?

30
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:01,920
I can feel Bobby
in this house.

31
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,521
Annie, the reason
we moved up here...

32
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,223
I know, I know.

33
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,793
Moving away from
the city isn't the same

34
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,096
as moving away from
the memories.

35
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,699
He's always going to be with us.

36
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,168
Annie, honey, yes,
in our hearts

37
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,071
but not in the house.

38
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,379

39
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,532
[house creaking]

40
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,636
I really don't care
how far he has to drive.

41
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,804
We had the inspection
over a month ago

42
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,305
and I've called
several times already.

43
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,307
<i>But the report says
there's nothing wrong...</i>

44
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,276
I understand,

45
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,244
but the smell in the cellar
needs to be taken care of.

46
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,679
Now.

47
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,747
It smells like smoke.

48
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:03,882
<i>Have you seen any smoke, sir?</i>

49
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,750
No, I haven't seen smoke

50
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,752
but I think I know
what it smells like.

51
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,320
It's a hundred degrees
down there.

52
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,523
<i>All right. We'll send
somebody out in the morning.</i>

53
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,458
Thank you.

54
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,527
I'll see him then.

55
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,299
Well, the electrician is
finally coming out...

56
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,134
Look.

57
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,302
Oh, hon.

58
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,236
Did you drop it?

59
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,738
No.

60
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,907
I found it like this.

61
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,608
Well, I'll just
get another frame

62
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,177
when I go into town tomorrow.

63
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,913
You don't think it
means something?

64
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,449
What?

65
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,585
He never liked this photo.

66
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:44,289
Remember how we always hid it
when girls came over?

67
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,959
Yeah.

68
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:52,163
- He used to say that he
thought his smile was...
- Crooked.

69
00:13:56,203 --> 00:14:00,138
And you think he
still doesn't like it?

70
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,309
[knocking on door]

71
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,610
Expecting anyone?

72
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,978
No.

73
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,583
Find a spot for the photo and
we'll get a new frame tomorrow.

74
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,096
I told you someone was home.

75
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,432
I'm Dave McCabe.
This is my wife Cat.

76
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,734
We live down the road.

77
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,136
We're your neighbors.

78
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:32,904
Hello.

79
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,239
I'm Paul Sacchetti.

80
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,076
This is my wife Anne,
and we live here,

81
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,512
and we are your neighbors.

82
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,114
Very nice to meet you.

83
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,983
Well, we've been two weeks

84
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,419
and you're the first
folks to come by.

85
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,022
Two weeks?

86
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,758
That is a surprise.

87
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,827
Usually there's a bit
of chatter in town

88
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,996
when someone moves
into this old house...

89
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:02,033
you know,
with the history and all.

90
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,769
Oh, where's my manners?
I'm sorry.

91
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,337
Would you like to
come in for a drink?

92
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,907
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

93
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,041
Pardon the mess.

94
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,944
We're still getting
a little settled in.

95
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,846
Oh, no, it's, uh...

96
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,314
This is lovely.
Lovely.

97
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,349
Thank you.

98
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,685
Oh, uh, what can I get
for the two of you?

99
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,853
A tea or...

100
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,987
- Oh, don't bother.
- A coffee maybe.

101
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,989
- Whiskey?
- Oh.

102
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,258
That'll be very nice.
Sit, Cat.

103
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Go ahead, sit.

104
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:41,072
So, um, what was this history
you mentioned, Dave?

105
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,174
We heard it was
a funeral parlor

106
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,410
around the turn of the century?

107
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,614
But, I've got to say,
the price they were asking

108
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,416
wasn't about to scare us away.

109
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,184
Good. Good.

110
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:58,056
So, the realtor told you
all about the Dagmars.

111
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,491
Yes. That was the family...
Thank you...

112
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,592
Who first lived here, right?

113
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,094
Yes.
Yes, that's right.

114
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:08,066
I mean, the town built this
house for him back in 1859.

115
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,300
Well, cheers.

116
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,702
Oh, yes.

117
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:14,005
To new friends,
and new beginnings.

118
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,242
1859.
You don't say?

119
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,444
Yeah.

120
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:24,382
It wasn't long after that
that the trouble began.

121
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,285
Old Dagmar had been
running the parlor

122
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,555
no more than a couple
of months when...

123
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:34,292
well, what do you know,
word got out that

124
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:38,396
they were selling the bodies
and burying empty coffins.

125
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,532
People were saying he
was selling the corpses

126
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,036
to the university
over in Essex County.

127
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,105
Some even said he was selling
them to the Orientals

128
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:51,509
over in Boston,
turning them into chop suey.

129
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,311
[coughing]

130
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,147
The town ran him
and his wife

131
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,217
and the little girl
out on a rail.

132
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,920
It was just the saddest thing.

133
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,255
They moved to Providence

134
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:10,161
but his family just couldn't
stand the sight of him.

135
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:14,265
Old Dagmar drank himself to
death no more than a year later.

136
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,136
They say he was no more than
a shell of a man at the end.

137
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:22,106
He was more than a shell.

138
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,175
- No, we hadn't heard anything...
- You told us...

139
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,476
(whispering)
Honey, it's all right.

140
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,845
No. You're quite right, kid,
you're quite right.

141
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,748
Yes.
I'm so sorry.

142
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,018
Here I am with you nice folks
no more than five minutes

143
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,189
and I'm already
knee-deep in devils.

144
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,193
She's an old, old house,
this one, yeah.

145
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,463
Well...

146
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,199
We should be off.
We're in a bit of a hurry.

147
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,534
- So soon?
- Yes, yes.

148
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,503
We were just driving into
town and saw your light

149
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,971
and wanted to stop by.

150
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,207
Well, feel free to
stop by anytime.

151
00:17:56,209 --> 00:18:00,211
Oh, thank you, thank you.
We will.

152
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,214
You take care of this old place.

153
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,484
It needs a family.

154
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,120
Thanks, Dave.

155
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,155
It has been 30 years

156
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,225
since we've had fresh souls
in the Dagmar House.

157
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,128
I think we can call it
the Sacchetti House now.

158
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,198
Yeah, well, it's...

159
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,135
it's still Dagmar's House.

160
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,337
Come on, Cat.

161
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,545
Cat, come on.

162
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,898

Watch the bottom step.

170
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,588
Whew.

171
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,357
You can feel it, can't you?

172
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,825
Of course, I can.

173
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,329
It's hot as hell down here,
Mr. Sacchetti.

174
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,264
What do you got over there?

175
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,934
Old foundation,
needs to be replaced.

176
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,537
Nothing back there?

177
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:50,841
No.

178
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,109
Well, look.

179
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,244
Unless you want to hang
out in the sauna with me,

180
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:54,578
feel free to go about your day.

181
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,380
I'll give you call out
if I need anything.

182
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,782
Thanks, Joe.
You're a life saver.

183
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,667
All right.

184
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,551
- Just give me shout.
- Yeah.

185
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,665
Hey, kiddo.

186
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,567
How are we doing?

187
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,436
Not bad.

188
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:24,075
Minus last night,
has the weirdness died down?

189
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,077
It's not weirdness.

190
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,714
You know what I mean.

191
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,849
Yeah.

192
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,420
I still feel something here.

193
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,260
So what are we
going to do about it?

194
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:46,397
What if Jacob and May
came up for the weekend?

195
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,733
May has always been
interested in this stuff.

196
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,502
She told me once that
people pay her to do séances.

197
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,171
People with too much money.

198
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,439
And you like Jacob.

199
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,842
- He is always so...
- Stoned?

200
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,944
Earthy.

201
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:03,414
And they wrote us that
lovely note after the accident.

202
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:07,418
They said they'd
always be there for us.

203
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,819
I just think they
might be able to help.

204
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:13,758
You already invited them,
didn't you?

205
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,893
Yeah.

206
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,728
[chuckles]

207
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,887
Alright.

208
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,602

209
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:29,033
[footsteps]

210
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,135
Hello?

211
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,580
They told me if we
were okay with it,

212
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,916
they'd invite Harry
up for the weekend, too.

213
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,686
Why would Harry want to spend
a weekend with his parents

214
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,489
and the parents of
his dead room...

215
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,628
Sorry.
That was rude.

216
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,266
Like Dave said,
this house needs a family.

217
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,799
[crackling]

218
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,888
Ah!

219
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,997
Oh, shit.

220
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,801
He's burned bad!

221
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,304
Annie, call an ambulance!

222
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,544
I don't care if you have
to disconnect the boiler,

223
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,612
I don't want a
health hazard like that

224
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,013
in my goddamn basement.

225
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,715
It almost killed my
electrician this afternoon.

226
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,717
<i>You do realize that it's
a really old boiler...</i>

227
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,619
I don't want excuses.
I want it fixed.

228
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,220
<i>- Yes, sir, of course.</i>
<i>- </i> Great.

229
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,889
Thank you.

230
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,125
Do you want me to call
Jacob and May

231
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,226
and tell them not to come?

232
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,629
No.
It's alright.

233
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,631
Just tell them
it might get a bit chilly

234
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,866
if the boiler does crap out.

235
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,802
I'm sure they'll be fine.

236
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:47,638
Yeah, just throw a little
more Maui Wowie on the fire,

237
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,673
they'll be fine.

238
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,343
I need a whiskey.
You want one?

239
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,311
Sure.

240
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:02,286
It'll be nice having May here.

241
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:16,967
I know you think it's silly...

242
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,138
but I really can feel
something here, Paul.

243
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,073
Oh!

244
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,611
What happened?

245
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,279
What's that smell?

246
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,948
[sniffs]

247
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,150

¶¶

250
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,431
Well, I just don't get it.

251
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:48,699
What's not to get?

252
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,734
Annie wants us up there
for the weekend.

253
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,236
Yeah, but why?

254
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,639
She says the house
has a strange aura.

255
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,907
Ever since they moved in,

256
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,777
she feels Bobby's there
watching them.

257
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,745
Well, maybe it's
nice Bobby is there.

258
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:05,449
I mean, after the crash,
Anne was in such a bad place.

259
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,551
I mean, if Bobby's up there
with her, maybe that's...

260
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,019
I don't know.
It's kind of sweet.

261
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,724
If Bobby is still with them,
it means he is not letting go.

262
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:17,161
They want us up there to
help find out what's going on.

263
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,629
Okay.

264
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,532
Well, you can't make me believe
that Paul is buying any of this.

265
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,567
I mean, I just feel like there
could be a lot of negative

266
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,438
energy if we get there and we
all get off on the wrong foot.

267
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,374
I mean, I just don't want Annie
thinking that we're gonna

268
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:34,278
walk in there and just
start waving, you know,

269
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,783
dark crystals around
and exorcise the demons.

270
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,987
We're just company.
We're not going to say anything.

271
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,483
Annie, they're here.

272
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,451
Annie!

273
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,728
She's driving?!
That's, uh,...

274
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,064
Progressive.
Be good.

275
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,934
Annie.

276
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,473
How are you holding up?

277
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,109
I'm just really
glad you're here.

278
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,982
Paulie, how ya doing, man?

279
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,183
Sorry.

280
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,285
Just a little work
around the house.

281
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,255
Salt of the earth.
Way to go, man.

282
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,190
Oh, now this is living!

283
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,725
How are you, Paul?

284
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:56,160
Good, May.
How are you?

285
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,997
You know, Harry is coming
out later with his girlfriend.

286
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,532
Yeah.

287
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,901
It will be good
to see him again.

288
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:06,436
He and Bobby sure were...

289
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,808
inseparable.

290
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,776
They might still be.

291
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,445
That's why we wanted him here.

292
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,148
Bobby was so wonderful.

293
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,119
We think about him
all the time, Annie.

294
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,121
Thank you.

295
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,791
Pull the car around back,
if you like.

296
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,860
Oh, okay.

297
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,895
Let's go inside,
drop these bags

298
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,898
and maybe you guys can
show us around town.

299
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,901
Well, there's nothing more
than a burger joint.

300
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:38,936
Buffalo Bill's.

301
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,271

You guys eatin'?

306
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,786
Yeah.
Four, please?

307
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:05,422
Tables are in the back.

308
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,156
This is going to be weird,
isn't it?

309
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,391
No way.

310
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,625
We're just going to
hang out, you know?

311
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,227
Mom and Dad are going to
wave around a few crystals

312
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,363
and we head back
to the city on Sunday.

313
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,598
They really believe in
that stuff, don't they?

314
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,033
Oh, yeah.

315
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,669
And since Bobby and I were
roommates freshman year,

316
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,441
they figured, you know, we
got some sort of connection.

317
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:00,844
What happened to Bobby?

318
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:04,781
Car crash,
about two months back.

319
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,616
He was just on his way
home from school

320
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,586
and got hit by a flatbed.

321
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,155
All kind of creepy.

322
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:16,026
You know, Mom says
Mrs. Sacchetti thinks that

323
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:21,798
Bobby is with them
in the new house.

324
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,267
Thanks for the invite.

325
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,541
So they're in our living room,
not even 30 seconds.

326
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,910
They both practically
inhale their scotches

327
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,212
and then he just goes off.

328
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:38,215
And his poor wife just
sits there listening to him

329
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:41,284
give us this story about the
old owner being run out of town

330
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:45,789
for selling corpses
and then killing himself.

Are you sure this place
doesn't freak you out?

around kooks like my folks

00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:23,180
[wind blowing]

363
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,297
I guess they don't see a lot
of new faces around here.

364
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,567
Well, I think we should try
to avoid pissing them off.

365
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,303
Apparently they have a history
of going all mob justice

366
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,439
on the new faces.

367
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:54,077
It's really a nice place
you picked, Paul.

368
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,980
What are friends for?

369
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,849
I'm just going to enjoy
my meal now.

370
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,352
Watch my back.

371
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,622
It's pretty good, though.

372
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,687
Aw, come on!

373
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,889
Move it.

374
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:52,369
So, uh,
what do we do now?

375
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,513
[distant bang]

376
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,554
Hello?

377
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,857
What?

378
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,526
I think they might be home.

379
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,529
Really?

380
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,597
Yeah.

381
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:44,554
[door creaks open]

382
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,393
Well, nice.

383
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,443
Baby, what are you doing?

384
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,311
<i>I'm in the cellar.</i>

385
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,913
<i>Door's in the hall.</i>

386
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,549
<i>What?!</i>

387
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,950
Yeah, I heard a sound.

388
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:18,221
I thought maybe a raccoon
or something was down here.

389
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:22,625
Of course, you would find the
creepiest place in this house.

390
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:27,897
Is it just me or is it, like,
majorly hot down here?

391
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,370
[crackling]

392
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,206
Danny, you...

393
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,741
You okay?

394
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,843
[roaring]

395
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,813
Ah!

396
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,119
[coughing]

397
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,922
What?
Honey, are you all right?

398
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,024
I don't know...

399
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,697
Shit!

400
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,651
[engine cranking]

401
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,269
Fucking shit!

402
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,671
Goddamn it!

403
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,575
Oh, fuck!

404
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,747
[coughing]

405
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,690
[engine sputtering]

406
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,372
[music playing]

407
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,308
¶¶

408
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,176
[music stops]

409
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,752
[wind blowing]

410
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,799
Are you going to be okay?

411
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,968
I think so.

412
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,786
I guess Harry and his
girlfriend didn't make it.

413
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,891
Ah, they probably just
stopped for the night.

414
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,602
Would anyone like a nightcap?

415
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,904
Oh, I wouldn't refuse one.

416
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,107
You do not have to
ask me twice.

417
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:04,380
Well, I gotta say,
this is one weird fucking town.

418
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:05,915
- Paul.
- Ha!

419
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,968
No, he's right.

420
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:12,020
You guys have moved in
to one weird fucking town.

421
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,090
I think it was
just a little spell.

422
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,960
You know, sometimes
things get a little hazy.

423
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:17,827
Like a migraine?

424
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:21,431
Yes,
but on a spiritual level.

425
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:22,699
It's hard to describe.

426
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,801
Do you think
it could be Bobby?

427
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,236
I won't know until
we make contact.

428
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:31,641
Is that something that
you two regularly do?

429
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,611
You know, you may not
buy into it, Paulie,

430
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,513
but I have seen things
over the years

431
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,650
that would knock
your socks off.

432
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:43,686
Well, if you can disprove
my skepticism,

433
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:46,889
I will be very, very impressed.

434
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:49,726
What do you think, honey,
should we should him?

435
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:50,994
- Can you give me a moment?
- Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,662
Can you give me a
moment before we begin?

437
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,797
- I just need a little time
to freshen up.
- Sure.

438
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,566
Let me show you your room.

439
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,402
It's not really set up yet
but the bed's comfy.

440
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,492
Migraine?

441
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,727
"Oh, but on a spiritual level."

442
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:25,995
Now, come on, Paul.

443
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,964
You said you'd cut
them some slack.

444
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,733
I know.

445
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,501
Actually, Jacob's a lot
cooler than I remember.

446
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:34,303
Still stoner,
but good guy.

447
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,172
No beef with him.

448
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,241
You're going to get them
set up with some fresh linens

449
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:41,210
and then we are going to go
back down to that living room

450
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:44,947
and give this a chance.

451
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,451
Then I'm seriously
going to need that glass.

452
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,388
If you promise to be civil,

453
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,724
I promise to keep pouring.

454
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,293
I promise.

455
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,474
Long night, eh?

456
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,976
What'd those folks talk about?

457
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:16,446
What folks?

458
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:18,414
[scoffs]

459
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,916
The only folks in here
all night

460
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:23,152
who I have not known
my whole goddamn life.

461
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:27,724
Nothing really,
just the house.

462
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,992
Are all four of them
staying up there?

463
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,761
I think.

464
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,629
[knocking on door]

465
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:36,466
We're closed!

466
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:38,901
[slow knocking on door]

467
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,404
Oh, fuck's sake, will you
please go find out who it is

468
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,474
and tell them that we've
already turned off the ovens.

469
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:55,585
No, we're all closed up...

470
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,519
[gun shot]

471
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,187
[body hits the ground]

472
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,828
Oh shit.

473
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:08,765
I didn't know you
were coming down.

474
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,299
I wouldn't have sent
the new girl to the door.

475
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,001
Yeah.

476
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,170
You heard they were here,
huh?

477
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,605
Yeah.

478
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,174
No thanks to you, Maddie.

479
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,143
I'm sorry, Dave.

480
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,713
What about the other couple?

481
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,081
Not much.

482
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,315
Hippies.

483
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:29,252
They were telling them
they could sense something.

484
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,456
Is that so?

485
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,092
And that they should leave.

486
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:41,964
Maddie, you tell me
every word they said.

487
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,067
- Maybe you should...
- Sit down!

488
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,409
You do realize what will
happen if they leave, don't you?

489
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,511
Yeah.

490
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,114
Do you really, Maddie?

491
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,016
Do you?

492
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:03,920
The town didn't
realized it back in '49.

493
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:07,323
And when that darkness
didn't get a new family,

494
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:12,728
it spread like plague
until it found many.

495
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,831
The Dagmars will get them.

496
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,632
After what this town
did to that family,

497
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:19,035
they'd kill God himself if
He walked into their house.

498
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:22,405
But they haven't, Maddie.

499
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:25,641
They haven't

500
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,677
and it's time.

501
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,045
The darkness under that house

502
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:34,917
wakes up every 30 years
like clockwork and it's hungry.

503
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:39,789
If it doesn't get a
new family this time,

504
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,459
it's gonna swallow this town.

505
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:46,462
Then we'll do it ourselves.

506
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,541
Oh!

507
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,576
Oh, I...

508
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,978
Sorry.

509
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,947
I mean, I thought we
were getting comfortable.

510
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,682
No, it's cool.

511
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:11,754
Just wasn't expecting you to
be so relaxed with the policy.

512
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,523
Yeah, I'll smoke outside.

513
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,327
Sorry I took so long.

514
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,963
I was feeling the most
unreal energy in the hall.

515
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:24,600
Yeah, no,
it's total unreal, right?

516
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,435
Are you comfortable?

517
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,371
Yeah.

518
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:36,979
There is a real power
in this house.

519
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,148
It's a heavy power.

520
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:44,620
Something that was born
out of decades of secrets.

521
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,988
There is a darkness here.

522
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,859
Yeah.
I mean, it's here.

523
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,461
I don't feel Bobby here.

524
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:56,866
It's something that wants
you to believe it's Bobby.

525
00:48:56,868 --> 00:48:58,968
What?

526
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,504
What does that mean?

527
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:06,442
This house has an
energy all its own.

528
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:10,146
So are we going to have
a séance or something?

529
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:12,198
No, no.

530
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,399
- I means, that depends on...
- Depends on what?

531
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,820
You said you knew
how to contact him.

532
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,323
Annie brought you up here to
find out what was in this house.

533
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:22,175
- Paul...
- No.

534
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,026
May, you can't give Annie
all this hope

535
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,028
and then not deliver
on anything at all.

536
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,532
We don't need to find
the darkness here, Paul.

537
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,036
It's everywhere.

538
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:44,113
[wind blowing]

539
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,750
[snoring]

540
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,031
[wind blowing]

541
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,321
[floor creaking]

542
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,064
Hello?

543
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,738
Jacob?

544
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,608
Do you need something?

545
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:49,612
May?

546
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:00,623
[whispering]

547
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,691
No...

548
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,365
Hello?

549
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,700
[fire crackling]

550
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,811
[door creaks open]

551
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,283
[whispering]

552
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,718
No! No!

553
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,786
- May...
- No!

554
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,489
- May, May...
- There's so much death!

555
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,460
Annie.
Annie, wake up.

556
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:38,861
Annie!

557
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,230
Annie!

558
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:45,367
[screaming]

559
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,473
You're alright.
You're alright.

560
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:52,141
You're alright.

561
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,177
<i>- You're okay.</i>
<i>- </i> Bobby?

562
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,314
Did you hear that?

563
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:06,655
[wind blowing]

564
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:34,049
We had, uh...

565
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,852
We had an encounter last night.

566
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,690
Yeah, I, uh...

567
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,926
You what, Paul?

568
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:49,365
I saw something, too.

569
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:55,171
I don't know what I saw, I just
want to know what's going on.

570
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,740
Well, I heard Bobby.

571
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,081
I need some air.

572
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,250
Um, I have to go out
and get some groceries.

573
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:09,852
You should come along.

574
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:12,288
The boys can stay here.

575
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,957
A little male-bonding
might do them good.

576
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,492
You guys think you
can handle that?

577
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:18,427
Yeah.

578
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,529
What do you think
we're going to do, baby?

579
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,233
Start conducting a séance
the second you leave?

580
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:27,203
Go on.
Go on.

581
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,775
Here are the keys,
if you want to drive.

582
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:34,877
I'll drive.

583
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,111
Not my car, she won't.

584
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,581
Don't worry.
We can take May's car.

585
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,683
Back in an hour.

586
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,487
I love you.

587
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,225
Oh, no-no-no.

588
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,460
Can we take your car?

589
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:02,972
Uh, Jake?

590
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,241
Yes, Paul?

591
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,309
What's going on, dude?

592
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:12,281
We are conducting a séance.

593
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,750
Excuse me?

594
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,620
You should've seen May
last night, man.

595
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:22,358
She said she was
surrounded by death.

596
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,493
And I just heard no séance.

597
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,095
You think she'd
be okay with this?

598
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,697
Absolutely not,

599
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,467
which is why we're
going to do it right now.

600
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,304
Come on, man, sit.

601
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:41,310
[church bell ringing]

602
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,316
It felt like the weight
of the world,

603
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:49,585
just crushing my soul.

604
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,320
God...

605
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,357
There's something in that
house that feels infernal,

606
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,328
something that I've
never felt before.

607
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,130
What does that mean exactly?

608
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:04,800
Something's not right
in that house.

609
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,468
Is that so?

610
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,204
- Oh, hi, Dave.
- Hi, Annie.

611
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,040
And who is this
lovely young lady?

612
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,374
This is my friend, May.

613
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,210
She and her husband are visiting
with us for the weekend.

614
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:16,945
Oh, how nice.

615
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:20,049
Well, it's an honest-to-God
pleasure, Miss May.

616
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:21,483
How's Cat doing?

617
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,353
Oh, she's fine, just fine.

618
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:26,322
Check-up with the doctor.

619
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,923
And you're...

620
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,225
Oh, just wandering the streets

621
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:33,395
and eavesdropping on
lovely young ladies.

622
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:37,533
Miss May, did I hear you
correctly saying there's, uh...

623
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:41,070
something not quite right
with Annie's house?

624
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:44,373
I'd be surprised
if there wasn't,

625
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,508
I mean,
with that kind of past.

626
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,377
That house probably
has more demons

627
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:51,680
than the Book of Revelations.

628
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,416
Is it true
what happened up there?

629
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:57,186
Running the Dagmars out of town?

630
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:00,456
Oh, it's true.
Hand to the Lord.

631
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,792
Because I saw a family
there last night.

632
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,363
You did?

633
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:14,570
May has... abilities.

634
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:17,940
Well, I'd say she
certainly does.

635
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:23,011
We need to get back, Annie.

636
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,417
- I'm sorry, Dave.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

637
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,419
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Annie.

638
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,921
Bye, Miss May.

639
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:46,935
So, I'm just going to read
a few lines here

640
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:53,675
and see if we can connect to
whatever is in the house, okay?

641
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:59,982
So, you just sit there and um,
maybe close your eyes

642
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:07,984
and just try to believe
what we're doing is real.

643
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:21,203
It's just so helpful
if you're in a zone.

644
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:39,354
We are addressing
any spirits here.

645
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,758
This house belongs
to the living.

646
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,395
Their names are Paul and Anne,

647
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:51,533
and they have a connection
to your world.

648
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:57,539
Their son Bobby is with you.

649
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:03,412
And if it's Bobby's spirit
that we have felt,

650
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:08,484
please, give us a sign.

651
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,524
[distant bang]

652
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:39,481
This house welcomes his spirit

653
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:45,120
and asks him to join us.

654
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:50,926
And with love and compassion,

655
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:56,932
we will help him
cross to the next realm...

656
00:58:56,934 --> 00:59:00,969
and peel...

657
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,138
the skin...

658
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,040
off...

659
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,742
his...

660
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,710
bones.

661
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,680
What did you say?

662
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:16,919
It's a...
it's a welcoming.

663
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:22,591
We try to connect to
the... to the spirit

664
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:26,562
by asking them into our circle.

665
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:30,832
And so, you know,
I'm asking my son to join us.

666
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,468
My son.

667
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,837
Bobby.
My son.

668
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,641
Yeah.

669
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,677
Sorry. Sorry.

670
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:48,584
I mean, it's a sacred blessing
to those we hold dear,

671
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:54,856
and so we ask Bobby to...

672
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,961
rot...

673
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:00,596
like...

674
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,731
wasted... meat.

675
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:06,001
This is bullshit.
I'm done.

676
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:09,371
- It's not Bobby.
- What?

677
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,606
It's not Bobby!

678
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,708
[wind blows]

679
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:14,876
Ah!

680
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:28,023
[distorted]
Your boy is dead.

681
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:37,566
He's in the cellar.

682
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:42,371
He and his little whore.

683
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:51,313
They're downstairs burning.

684
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,849
The both of them.

685
01:00:55,753 --> 01:01:02,658
Burning like my whole family.

686
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,095
Burning until the stars go dark.

687
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:12,234
Fuck! Paul!

688
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:13,953
Paul!

689
01:01:13,954 --> 01:01:15,671
- Paul, tie me up, man!
- Are you nuts?!

690
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,040
Get a rope or something, man!

691
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,308
Hurry up, man!

692
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,077
Tie me up!

693
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:24,946
Ah!

694
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,728
What is it?

695
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,296
That Dave?

696
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,699
He seems a little off.

697
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,468
He's just a harmless old man.

698
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,573
I still don't see Harry's car.

699
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,709
May, don't worry about it.

700
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,744
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

701
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,246
I don't want them
coming up here.

702
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:00,315
None of us should
be staying here, Annie.

703
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,451
May...

704
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,803
Help!

705
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,505
Help!
It's Jacob.

706
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,441
May, I believe it, all of it.
Help!

707
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,113
Jacob?

708
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:34,683
What's going on?

709
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:36,284
Jacob, he lit some candles

710
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,153
and he started digging up
some weird...

711
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,856
- I don't know, auras or
something after you left...
- Auras?!

712
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,691
Whatever the fuck
they're called, May!

713
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:43,959
Look at him!

714
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,328
[grunting]

715
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,044
Why, he's right!

716
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:07,215
Dug up some devils
while you were out.

717
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,389
What happened?

718
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:18,393
This town is what happened.

719
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:27,803
This is my house.

720
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,174
He's...

721
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:32,874
Dagmar.

722
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,276
[phone ringing]

723
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:35,278
What do we do?

724
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,853
What?

725
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,822
I told you to leave.

726
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,857
<i>It's Dagmar!
He's real!</i>

727
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:51,927
Dagmar...

728
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:57,532
isn't what you need
to be worried about...

729
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,101
<i>Fuck you!</i>

730
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,674
- Liar!
- May!

731
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,576
He's not dead!

732
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,010
He's dead.

733
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:14,516
He and that little harlot he
brought into my happy home.

734
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,119
My son's not dead!

735
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,423
May.

736
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:27,128
[weeping]

737
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:30,733
No!

738
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,707
Jacob?

739
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:41,877
Talk to him, May!
He's got to be in there!

740
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,546
This is my house.

741
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:46,748
You should have known better.

742
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,851
Jacob,
baby, are you in there?

743
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,587
You've got to listen
to my voice.

744
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:55,390
I need you to concentrate.

745
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,425
Think about me.

746
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,894
Think about us.

747
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,195
Oh shit.

748
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:04,065
After what you did to
the people of this town?

749
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,001
What?!

750
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,770
After what I did?!

751
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,006
You're going to listen
to that old bastard?!

752
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:14,175
We were good people!

753
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:17,913
This town murdered my family!

754
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:20,682
They sacrificed them
to the gods they dug up

755
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,617
when they built this place!

756
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,454
Nobody knew what was under this
house until it was too late.

757
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,289
Jacob!

758
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:30,158
You've got to listen
to my voice!

759
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:41,236
They opened something awful
and it needed a family.

760
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:42,771
I love you.

761
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:46,641
Please, fight it.

762
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:50,712
This is my house.

763
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:55,050
Ah!

764
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:05,894
Oh, no, no.
Oh God.

765
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:07,295
Jacob! Jacob!

766
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,265
Oh, May,
don't look at him!

767
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,701
We got to leave!
We got to go!

768
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:15,303
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

769
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,205
Go!

770
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,210
[gun shot]

771
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:27,115
Annie!

772
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:31,186
<i>Open the door, Annie.</i>

773
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:33,088
<i>It'll all be over soon.</i>

774
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,090
<i>I'm not alone, Annie.</i>

775
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:37,092
<i>Open the door.</i>

776
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:39,427
No!

777
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,196
Ah!

778
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:48,303
Get upstairs!

779
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:01,883
<i>Mom, please, go!</i>

780
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:02,984
Did you hear that?

781
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:03,986
Yeah.

782
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:05,720
It was Bobby!

783
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:06,888
Come on, Annie,
you were right.

784
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,590
- We got to keep moving.
- That was our son!

785
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:09,791
I know!
I heard him

786
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:12,627
and he told us
to fucking leave!

787
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:34,015
You see anything?

788
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:35,316
Nothing.

789
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,285
Ah!

790
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:40,388
Go. Go.

791
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,290
[fire crackling]

792
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,660
It's not much...

793
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,632
They're upstairs!

794
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,108
Ah!

795
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,310
Get the fuck off of me!

796
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:06,314
Ah!

797
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:26,167
[door creaks open]

798
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,393
Go!
Go, go, go.

799
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,339
Ah!

800
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:06,841
Ah!

801
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,164
Lem! Ah!

802
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,165
Is there any other way upstairs?

803
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,667
I...
I don't...

804
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,369
Ah!

805
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,937
Lem!

806
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,872
Ah!

807
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,883
We're going to get
out of here, Annie.

808
01:09:58,495 --> 01:10:00,595
<i>Ah!</i>

809
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,306
Ah!

810
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,514
Ah!

811
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,417
Dagmar!

812
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,454
What in Hell is going on?

813
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:27,989
Huh?

814
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:33,061
These folks been in
this house two weeks

815
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,663
and they're still alive.

816
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,232
Why?

817
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:40,034
Something special about them?

818
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:43,304
You wanted this house so bad
you were willing to kill for it

819
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:45,473
so we just let you.

820
01:10:45,475 --> 01:10:48,176
Having you here made
every sacrifice after you

821
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:51,246
a hell a lot easier.

822
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:53,881
Whatever anger you
had that kept you here,

823
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:59,320
I am grateful for it,
but you know what has to done.

824
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:02,090
You know what
you're supposed to do.

825
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,325
Now get it done.

826
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:33,588
Annie!

827
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:39,494
[blood squirting]

828
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:27,909
Well, well,
it's my new neighbors.

829
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:30,078
Come in, come in.

830
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,048
- What do you want?
- Back up.

831
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:41,422
It's not what I want.
It's what this house wants.

832
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:43,758
You're not leaving here.

833
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,161
You stay,
you satisfy the darkness.

834
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,830
And really,
why would you want to go

835
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:52,133
and leave your little boy
here all alone, huh?

836
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:55,336
Annie, you know
he is very much here.

837
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:58,272
You brought him with you
when you moved in.

838
01:12:58,274 --> 01:13:02,343
Now is your chance
to be with him always.

839
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,412
- Oh, fuck you, old man!
- Paul!

840
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:07,148
Paul, look at your wife.

841
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,350
Go on, look at her, man.

842
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:12,153
He's your son.

843
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:15,123
You know it's for the best.

844
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,458
Don't fight it.

845
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,461
Just accept it.

846
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:23,898
You see what happens
when you try to fight it?

847
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,433
Huh?

848
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:32,106
Every 30 years or so the
goddamn place just wakes up

849
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:36,377
and it demands new blood,

850
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:39,680
and our town is forced
to deliver it.

851
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:44,085
[sizzling]
[gurgling]

852
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,455
Ah!

853
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:03,704
Ah!

854
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,874
[fire crackling]

855
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,619
[door creaks open]

856
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,757
[wind blows]

857
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:07,068
<i>Don't be afraid, Mom.</i>

858
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:09,103
<i>I'm here.</i>

859
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:23,851
They're still here.

860
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:32,260
[distant whispering]

861
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:50,611
Annie.

862
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:55,283
Annie.

863
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:27,048
Hey, Bobby.

864
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,657
