Guard duty, weapons training,
changing up the hairstyle,

It's simple, really.

142
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:16,876
As with any RPG, tabletop,
electronic, or otherwise,

143
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,878
the key to survival
is allowing oneself

144
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,097
to be shaped by the
assigned environment.

145
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,600
In doing so, a broad range
of capabilities are acquired,

146
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,935
allowing one to flip the script
and use said capabilities

147
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:29,189
to shape said environment
for maximum longevity.

148
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,992
I'm saying I'm in the
process of said stage two.

149
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:36,362

It is indeed.

00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,025
Okay.

<i>The Hilltop's dry,

182
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,688
a full cartridge is now
the coin of the land.

183
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,723
Making bullets from scratch.

184
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,977
Spent casings, but the
innards are all us.

185
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,479
And by us, I mean me.

186
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,982
And you think you can do that...

187
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,734
here?

188
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,287
With just this?

189
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,823
Well, the digs will require
a thorough scrubbing.

190
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,911
We'll have to scare up a
hella ton of lead, but, yes.

191
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:37,299
I most definitely almost certainly
think I can do that here.

192
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:40,219
That, my friend,
is some damn fine

193
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,555
genuine outside-the-box
thinking.

194
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,557
(chuckles)

195
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,510
Where do we start?

196
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,479
Well, we should inform Rick,
talk with Olivia,

197
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,015
see what types of ammo would
be most valuable to produce.

198
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:56,018
I'm gonna hit pause so I can
kill that thing behind you.

199
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,854
Pump your brakes, Red.

200
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,772
I'm formally calling
dibs on this one.

201
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,741
<i>(walker snarling)</i>

202
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:04,243
Dibs is dibs.

203
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,578
Well, be my guest.

204
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,863
Get some.

205
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:10,449
(snarling)

206
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,201
Strike one.

207
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,042
Strike two.

208
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,608
Why did you--?

209
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,477
I called dibs.

210
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,315
You had zero
authority to--

211
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,650
To what?

212
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:45,901
Stop you from dying?

213
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,469
I had full control
of the situation.

214
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:51,240
You had better luck picking
up a turd by its clean end.

215
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:54,376
I'm gonna allow you to
apologize for saying that.

216
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:55,911
So how about
you do so right now?

217
00:17:55,913 --> 00:18:00,082
Timmy down there almost
ate your face, dumbass.

218
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,334
All due respect, screw you.

219
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,635
Beg your pardon?

220
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,888
Dispatching walkers
is well within my skill set,

221
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,589
so screw you
for suggesting otherwise.

222
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,258
Let me get something
straight, all right?

223
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,094
Using your<i> cabeza,</i>
this whole DIY ammo thing,

224
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,346
that is your damn skill set,

225
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:16,014
just like ghosting hostiles,

226
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:18,850
both of the undead and the
living variety, is mine.

227
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,986
Now, you truly want to survive
this world long-term,

00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,272
I suggest you learn
that posthaste.

229
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,659
Okay.

230
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:32,047
Thank you for your protection.

231
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,783
I most certainly needed it
between here and Houston.

232
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:38,036
But your services
are no longer required.

233
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,673
The truth, plain and honest.

234
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,176
You've outlived
your usefulness to me.

235
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,096
Is that so?

236
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:50,682
Plain and honest.

Oatmeal.

Hey.

00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,653
You want me to hold
your bags, or...?

249
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:37,289
Yeah.

250
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,318
If you set 'em on the counter,
I can tell you which.

251
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,420
No, we're gonna take it all.

We both did.

272
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,716
I know.

273
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:33,392
So was he older or younger?

274
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,894
Older.

275
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:37,863
By six minutes.

00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:46,571
Hilarious, right?

279
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,444
Nothing scared him.

280
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:53,979
He was brave.

281
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:59,251
He was angry, too.

I asked you to come with me because
you're brave like my brother

324

and sometimes you actually
make me feel safe.

325
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:57,215
And I wanted you here
because you're alone.

326

Probably for the first
time in your life.

<i>And because you're stronger
than you think you are,</i>

because I was afraid.

00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:26,962
Not coming out here,
not facing my shit.

00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:52,448
Look, this isn't how we like to
start new business arrangements,

364
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:55,551
but, well, you pricks kind
of set the tone, didn't you?

365
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:57,136
What do you want?

366
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,621
D: <i>I'm sorry, darlin', I
didn't catch your name.</i>

367
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:02,508
I'm D, or Dwight.

368
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,327
You can call me either.

369
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,930
So?

370
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:09,631
What's your name?

371
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,601
Rosita.
What do you want?

372
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,487
Well, Rosita...

373
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:18,157
it's not what I want.

374
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:21,360
It's what you and Daryl
are going to do.

375
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,029
You're going to let us
into your little complex.

376
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:27,416
<i>It looks like it's just
beautiful in there.</i>

377
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,319
<i>And then you're going
to let us take whatever</i>

378
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:32,921
and whoever we want...

379
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:37,593
or we blow Eugene's brains out.

380
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:39,328
<i>And then yours.</i>

381
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,563
And then his.

382
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,134
<i>I hope it doesn't
come to that, really.</i>

383
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:47,136
<i>Nobody else has to die.</i>

384
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,639
We just try and start with one.

385
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,808
You know...

386
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,111
maximum impact
to get our point across.

387
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:59,848
<i>So what's it gonna be?
You tell me.</i>

388
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:03,185
You wanna kill someone,
you start with our companion

389
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,321
<i>hiding over there
behind the oil barrels.</i>

390
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:09,558
He's a first-class a-hole and he
deserves it so much more than us three.

391
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,500
Go check it out.

392
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:22,671
(panting)

393
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,487
(screaming)

394
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:43,125
(gunfire)

395
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:49,114

396
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:54,736

(growls)

402
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,373
Fall back!
Fall back!

403
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:38,847
(gun clicks)

404
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,530
Rosita:
<i>Daryl, stop!</i>

405
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:00,102
<i>"Chapel" playing</i>

406
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:03,939

Rick's coming.

415
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,941
How is he?

416
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:23,013
Bullet just grazed him,

417
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:25,328
but it's a good thing we
got him back when we did.

418
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,100
<i>Antibiotics we picked up could
save him from an infection.</i>

419
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,419
<i>Could save his life.</i>

420
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:32,963
<i>That's what Denise did.</i>

421
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:35,905
(coughs)

422
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:38,408
You here?

423
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,793
Present.

424
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:42,378
Good.

425
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:48,501
I was not trying to kill you.

426
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:50,303
I was looking for a moment.

427
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:53,339
You found it.

428
00:37:53,341 --> 00:37:57,760
Do you apologize
for questioning my skills?

429
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:01,731
I apologize
for questioning your skills.

430
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:04,484
You know how to bite
a dick, Eugene.

431
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:07,187
I mean that
with the utmost of respect.

432
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:10,073
Welcome to stage two.

433
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,859
Don't need to welcome me.

434
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:15,195
I've been here a while.

435
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:26,422
<i>(door opens)</i>

436
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,770
I just heard.

437
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:43,172
You okay?

438
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:46,242
Abraham:
<i>You said I had choices.</i>

439
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,446
You have them, too.

440
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:55,685
<i>Could be 30 years for us here.</i>

441
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,225
That's still too short.

442
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,307
Come inside.

443
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:18,067
You were right.

444
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:20,069
I knew it when you said it.

445
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:36,486
Carol's voice: <i>I wish
it didn't have to end,</i>

446
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:39,188
<i>not this way.</i>

447
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,658
<i>It was never my intention
to hurt you,</i>

448
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,495
<i>but it's how it has to be.</i>

449
00:40:45,497 --> 00:40:47,930
<i>We have so much here--</i>

450
00:40:47,932 --> 00:40:52,151
<i>people, food, medicine, walls,</i>

451
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,404
<i>everything we need to live.</i>

452
00:40:56,524 --> 00:41:00,276
<i>But what we have
other people want, too,</i>

453
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:02,445
<i>and that will never change.</i>

454
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:06,616
<i>If we survive this threat
and it's not over,</i>

455
00:41:06,618 --> 00:41:08,534
<i>another one will be back
to take its place,</i>

456
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:10,453
<i>to take what we have.</i>

457
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,542
<i>I love you all here.</i>

458
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,628
<i>I do.</i>

459
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,264
<i>And I'd have to kill for you.</i>

460
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,766
<i>And I can't.</i>

461
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:25,385
<i>I won't.</i>

462
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:38,414
<i>Rick sent me away and I
wasn't ever gonna come back,</i>

463
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:41,250
<i>but everything happened
and I wound up staying.</i>

464
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,157
<i>But I can't anymore.</i>

465
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,461
<i>I can't love anyone because
I can't kill for anyone.</i>

(squeaking)

467
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:59,752
Carol's voice: <i>So I'm going,
like I always should have.</i>

468
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:06,642
<i>Don't come after me, please.</i>

469
00:42:06,644 --> 00:42:09,078
