1
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,784
Hello, emergency.
What service did you require, please?

2
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,464
Hello, quick, anybody,
just get help!

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,503
-Where are you calling from, sir?
-Kaihoro, phone box.

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,303
There was this roaring noise
and a big white light in the sky...

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,021
and then... these...
invaders started killing us!

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,421
Hold on sir, l'll connect you
with the lnternal Affairs Dpt.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,348
-No time, they're after me...
-Hello?

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,823
Aaaargh!

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,589
ls there anybody there?

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,068
What do you think, Minister?

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,658
Call a full-scale invasion alert, sir.

12
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,261
l'll phone the forces,
fighters frigates, footsloggers...

13
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,029
Perhaps that could all be
a bit showy.

14
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,063
l think this is a job for real men.

15
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,982
Just stop right there!

16
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,425
Stop!

17
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,664
l think you'd better kill him, Barry.

18
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,906
Jeez, he could be
Ministry or Works...

19
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,947
No, he's moving too fast.

20
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,389
Stop!
This is definitely your last chance!

21
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,739
That's the story!

22
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,506
l always thought you were
left-handed.

23
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,788
No, the head shot's
the only true stopper.

24
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,105
Ugh...

25
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,459
Aw Jeez!

26
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,427
l hope l'm note the poor bastard
that's got to clean that up.

27
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,619
Jesus!

28
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,989
Stick all the bits of brain
in a plastic bag, Barry.

29
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,782
We'll need them for analysis.

30
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,947
No bloody way mate.
Come down here and do that yourself.

31
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,460
You're the yung-ho scientist.

32
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,184
All right.
l'll be down straight after lunch.

33
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,505
But at least take a blood sample.

34
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,303
No need.
l'll just wring my strides out.

35
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,786
Well, at least we got
one live specimen.

36
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,423
Yeah.

37
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,426
Seen anyone else about,
Barry?

38
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,586
No, the place is completely
deserted.

39
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,305
They're probably all dead,
that's at least 75 people.

40
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,305
Jeez, l just hope we're in time
to save the world.

41
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,223
Well, l just hope you got it right
this time.

42
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,059
No doubt about it Barry.
l've been watching the skies.

43
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,341
And do you know
what the skies did?

44
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,099
-They pointed...
-They pointed at this place.

45
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,420
Why can't aliens be friendly?

46
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,018
There's no glowing fingers
on these bastards.

47
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,301
We've got a bunch of extra-terrestrial
psychopaths on our hands.

48
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,307
Like a... visit from a planet
full of Charlie Mansons.

49
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,261
They've wiped out
a small town for starters.

50
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,826
lt's my guess they'll go on
to something bigger next time.

51
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,903
-Christchurch, Wellington...
-Auckland?

52
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,907
Yeah, well that wouldn't be so bad.

53
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,619
Well you'd better contact
the others, Derek.

54
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,342
They should be in range now.

55
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,469
Tell them to keep an eye out...

56
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,501
for someone who could be
heading this way.

57
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,182
-Who?
-A collector.

58
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,459
There's some appeal on.

59
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,740
There's envelopes stuck
on all the doors...

60
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,462
and today's collection day.

61
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,141
Hey! There's something
that's just occurred to me too, mate.

62
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,225
What's that?

63
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,420
That joker you topped a while back.

64
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,269
He might have friends.

65
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,346
l'd keep my eyes skinned
if l were you.

66
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,065
You needn't worry.
l'm not stupid, thanks...

67
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,659
Come in Frank.
Ozzy, are you there?

68
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,101
Boys, are you there?

69
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,346
Turn it down, Ozzy!

70
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,346
That's elevator music
for headbangers.

71
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,220
Frank! Ozzy!
Are you there?

72
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,901
Yeah, we're here mate, but could
you use the proper call-sign?

73
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,022
-There could be people listening.
-There's nobody for miles, Frank.

74
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,348
Besides, l don't think
whispering's going to help.

75
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,108
He's got a point there, Frank.

76
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,264
What do you mean, nobody for miles?
l thought you were in Kaihoro

77
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,623
l am in Kaihoro
and l was right all long.

78
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,261
-They've done the entire town.
-Who's done the town?

79
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,506
The extra-terrestrial low-lifers.

80
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,300
And guess what!
We've caught one of the bastards!

81
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,586
Me and Barry got him
loping over the hills...

82
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,621
just like he owned the bloody place.

83
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,025
-Huh?
-Now do you believe me?

84
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,345
Jeez, look Derek,
just keep him there.

85
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,700
-You got him secured?
-Bloody oath!

86
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,708
Right, now don't touch him.
We'll be there in 45 minutes.

87
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,062
Whatever you do, don't harm him.
No physical violence!

88
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,750
Another thing, Derek,
keep a careful look-out.

89
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,743
-There could be more about.
-There was! Down on the beach!

90
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,826
Hell, well look.
Don't go near him.

91
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,899
-lt's a little late for that, Frank.
-What?

92
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,663
lt wasn't me.

93
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,623
Barry shot his head off.
He had the magnum.

94
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,545
l knew it was a mistake
to issue weapons.

95
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,628
We're a government department,
not a para-military unit.

96
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,423
The Astro-lnvestigation
and Defence Service.

97
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,108
Wish they change that name!

98
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,620
Due to the potentially
dangerous hazards involved...

99
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,628
All right, at least you managed
to convince the minister.

100
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,670
Aren't you interested
in this joker we caught then?

101
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,304
-Course we are, Derek.
-Right.

102
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,581
Stay where you are and l'll give you
an eye-witness description...

103
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,463
of this inter-galactic wanker.

104
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,501
Well, l'd describe him as
sort of human-shaped.

105
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,627
He's got jeans
and a blue shirt on.

106
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,139
Christ, he's nabbed
a bloody farmer!

107
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,784
Yeah, but there's
something strange about him.

108
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,863
Like he's got a screw loose
or something.

109
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,901
lt's a bloody farmer!

110
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,899
Yeah, Derek strikes again!

111
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,259
ls this another false alarm like the
Manners Street lnvasion Alert?

112
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,099
How do you explain the disappearance
of an entire township then, Frank?

113
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,427
The Kiwi Jonestown, of course,
that's it.

114
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,623
Drinking beer laced with cyanide
from little polystyrene cups.

115
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,628
Yeah, yeah,
OK Derek, just do me one favour.

116
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,705
What?

117
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,060
Try not to make him extinct
before we get there.

118
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,145
Out!

119
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,782
Christ, what a dork!
How the hell did he get in this team?

120
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,708
Well, this has buggered your plans
for conquering the universe, eh?

121
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,183
My friend the astro-bastard.
Time for talkies.

122
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,786
By the time my colleagues
get here...

123
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,949
l want to have you babbling
in some extra-terrestrial language.

124
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,979
Now in case you don't want
to do what you're told...

125
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,659
l could always encourage you
by hammering this cold steel...

126
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,068
into your fibula.

127
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,704
lt'll sure poke a nasty hole
in your marrow, mate.

128
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,980
We'll get the old ball rolling, eh?

129
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,219
Now, what are you dirty hooers
doing on my planet?

130
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,067
Oh, bugger it!

131
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,862
Well, looks as if it's time
for the old count of ten.

132
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,619
One...

133
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,378
Two...

134
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,905
Three...

135
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,425
Six...

136
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,144
Seven, eight...

137
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,738
Nein...

138
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,699
Ten.

139
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,229
Derek!

140
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,022
Derek!

141
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,219
Derek!

142
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,903
Come in, Derek!

143
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,099
What?

144
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,469
Aw jeez!

145
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,428
Oh, l should have expected that.

146
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,861
-Derek!
-All right!

147
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,748
Quickly Derek!

148
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,984
Come on!

149
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,269
Jeez Barry, you've got awful timing.
What?

150
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,188
Just listen to me.
You've got to get out of there fast!

151
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,778
Five of those blue-shirted freaks
are coming up.

152
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,628
They heard their mate screaming.

153
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,422
Get out of there fast Derek.

154
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,067
l can't do that.
l'm a Derek.

155
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,022
Dereks don't run.

156
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,061
Well, get up a tree or something.

157
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,022
Yeah, look don't worry.
l've taken precautions.

158
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,864
Oh, shit!

159
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,978
Shit!

160
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,903
Bastards!

161
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,508
Eat lead sucker!

162
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,428
Mammy!

163
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,699
l think this is going a little bit
over the top, Ozzy.

164
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,981
Nah, this'll do the trick.
Nobody'll be coming up this road.

165
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,225
But the nearest nuclear
reactor's in America.

166
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,899
But it could have been an explosion on
one of those Springbok warships.

167
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,622
Frank!
Ozzy!

168
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,818
Frank! Ozzy!
Come in!

169
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,269
Yeah, what is it Barry?

170
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,029
Jeez you guys
we're in trouble this time.

171
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,982
lt's really hit the fan.

172
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,990
Derek's wiped out
five of these alien jokers.

173
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,939
The place is like a bloody abattoir.

174
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,948
Where's Derek now?

175
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,585
Well, he's..
he's turned his toes up, guys.

176
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,861
Took a dive off the bloody cliff.

177
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,708
He's popped his rivets.

178
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,948
Poor Derek!

179
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,385
Who's going to look after
his aviary now?

180
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,820
Yeah, birds were the only thing
he could relate to.

181
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,864
Right, we'll be there
in about fifteen minutes.

182
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,860
No, l think it'll be best
if you sty where you are.

183
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,868
Just get the car off the road
until l call you back.

184
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,307
l'm going to head off in the direction
that alien joker was going...

185
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,829
when me and Derek caught him.

186
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,622
He must have been going
somewhere.

187
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,866
They've probably got a base
up there or something.

188
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,221
They don't need a base.
They beam down from their spaceship.

189
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,420
Well maybe they haven't seen
Star Trek, Ozzy.

190
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,739
Come on!

191
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,185
Shit!

192
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,549
Bye, bye!

193
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,988
That's my overtime up to date.
Here, do you want to do yours?

194
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,782
Hey, Frank!

195
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,785
Yeah, what is it Barry?

196
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,747
Where exactly are you two?

197
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,826
About five miles from Kaihoro.

198
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,668
Yeah well just stay put.

199
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,099
l think l might have spotted something
and l'm moving in closer.

200
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,899
Finished, Oz?

201
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,539
Oh, shit!

202
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,030
Uh, your phone...
Could l use your phone?

203
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,740
l was just... l was...

204
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,988
We've got trouble.

205
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,108
Good one!

206
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,458
Right, we're on our way.

207
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,022
l suppose you're wondering
why you're soaking...

208
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,023
in Reg's eleven
secret herbs and spices.

209
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,949
Tomorrow we're having you
for lunch.

210
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,708
You are the exotic
new taste sensation.

211
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,627
Human flesh is it!

212
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,388
You're going to be the first bit of meat
that we've had a chance...

213
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,785
to get our teeth into
since we arrived.

214
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,020
So we're going to treat ourselves
to a feast...

215
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,584
with you as the main course.

216
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,663
lt's quite an honour really.

217
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,783
We'd better leave
so he can get some sleep.

218
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,745
l'll have the head, Reg.
l want to suck his brains out.

219
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,698
We ought to go back to
get reinforcements.

220
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,298
-That'll take a day.
-And the rest!

221
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,466
Take two days to do
the bloody paperwork.

222
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,229
Yeah, and by then that collector
bloke could be dead.

223
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,628
lf he's not really.

224
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,940
Look, we'll go in....

225
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,467
after midnight.

226
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,984
Well, guess l'll have
to issue a gun to Ozzy.

227
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,189
Yeah, but don't forget about
his personality disorder.

228
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,980
Open season on E.T.s, Frank?

229
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,385
Remember Ozzy...

230
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,308
Get in quietly, get out quietly.

231
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,261
l certainly hope that is the case.

232
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,150
Sorry, Oz.
We won't be needing that.

233
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,060
Bloody Barry!
Bastard!

234
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,664
What are we going to do
if we're spotted, Frank?

235
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,862
Well, l guess we shoot the bastards.

236
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,788
My turn to the magnum.

237
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,949
l just wish we didn't have
to wear all this crap.

238
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,380
Yeah but you know what
the rules are.

239
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,104
When we work undercover
we have to remain faceless.

240
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,659
Oh l get it, just in case we kill
a lot of innocent people.

241
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,908
Don't you forget, we're only
authorised to use violence...

242
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,782
when there's a threat
to the planet earth.

243
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,544
-And the moon!
-And the moon!

244
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,343
There you go, Oz.
Stick this stuff on.

245
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,943
We ought to have a look around.

246
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,789
lf these are aliens, they might have
parked their spaceship.

247
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,946
They might have come
in a telephone box.

248
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,061
Well let's just get that guy out
and will contact base...

249
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,420
and give them
the code-words for invasion.

250
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,302
''The bastards have landed.''

251
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,182
''The bastards have landed.''

252
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,542
l'll be there in a moment, Robert.

253
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,265
Welcome my friends.
The job is almost done.

254
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,267
We take off for home tomorrow.

255
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,826
l'm sure you'll be pleased
to be leaving this shitty planet.

256
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,738
ln the meantime l must impress
upon you the importance...

257
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,747
of remaining in human form...

258
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,749
no matter how awkward, uncomfortable
and ugly it makes you feel.

259
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:48,261
We are so close to success
that we must take no chances.

260
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,701
Right.
Looks pretty quiet.

261
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,028
-Probably all gone to bed.
-Jeez, l hope not.

262
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,902
Right, synchronise watches.

263
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,629
Twelve oh one.

264
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,349
Check.

265
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,345
Check.

266
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,109
Let's go.
We're on triple time.

267
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,419
The sad news is that
we will be heading for Nalic Nod...

268
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,782
with six of our co-workers
in a state of permanent death.

269
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,267
They died today,
murdered by some real arse-holes.

270
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,985
Robert escaped their clutches
and reported back to me.

271
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,104
My God!

272
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,505
What the...?
My God... the blood!

273
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,385
Shit!

274
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,826
Somebody could get killed in here.

275
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,384
Vacuum the floors,
clean the windows and...

276
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,025
all the boxes must be loaded into
the freezer early in the morning.

277
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,903
We've been wasting our time
unless we can present samples...

278
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:29,385
to the Nalic Nod Fast Food Authority.

279
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,781
lsn't it amazing how you can fit
a whole town of humans...

280
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,583
into a few card of board boxes,
if you slice off the fat?

281
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,498
lt's the value of keeping your knife
sharp and your mind clean.

282
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,098
Jesus guys, Derek was right!

283
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,698
This is what's left
of the people from Kaihoro.

284
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,028
They're in those boxes!

285
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,938
Get him, Barry!

286
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,899
For God's sake guys,
keep it quiet!

287
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,823
Shut him up, Oz.

288
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,101
l've just cleaned that bit.

289
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,781
Uh, that's gross!

290
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,505
Gee!
They come to bits easy!

291
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,779
Get rid of it!

292
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,380
The old magic's still there.

293
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,148
What are you doing Frank?

294
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,023
l'm going to go in and find out
what's going on.

295
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,381
Here, he was carrying this.

296
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,949
You, stay here.

297
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,743
...the importance of keeping the
bloody books up to date.

298
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,667
The past week has been difficult...

299
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,145
and l would like to say
how proud l am of you all.

300
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,309
The manner in which you conducted
a very tricky slaughter operation...

301
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,660
has been a real credit to you
and indeed...

302
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,146
to the whole Crumb's Crunchy
Delights organisation.

303
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:12,424
Your paychecks will reflect
the gratitude of the company.

304
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,825
l don't think we'll have
any more trouble.

305
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:15,905
However...

306
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,066
we will be handing
these around later.

307
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,824
l am certain that...

308
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,228
when the homo sapiens taste takes
the galaxy by storm as it will..

309
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,989
Crumb's Crunchy Delights
will be back at the top.

310
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,625
McYaballow's Fried Moonrat
won't know what hit them.

311
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,980
All the livestock we need
are right here.

312
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,907
Four billion of them!

313
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,223
Right, Robert.

314
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,740
Once the Fast Food Authority
have checked the samples...

315
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,225
and issued
the Mass Slaughter Permits...

316
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,864
this grotty little planet
will tremble...

317
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,948
under the full might of
the Lord Crumb restaurant chain!

318
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,269
Within a year the giant mincer
will descend from the sky...

319
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,585
the sun reflecting
from its silver bits...

320
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,019
and no army on earth
will be able to stop...

321
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,788
the noddy-burger machine!

322
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,703
l see the gruel is ready!

323
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,744
An exquisite bouquet, Robert.

324
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,744
Aren't l Lucky, l got a chunky bit!

325
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,741
Here you are, boys.

326
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,620
We'll bring out a whole line...

327
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,140
of homo-sapiens low-calorie
delicacies...

328
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,983
juicy raw rump...

329
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,343
brains soaked in lemon juice...

330
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,023
spinal fluid sauce...

331
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,782
assorted organ stew...

332
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,787
sapien-burguers...

333
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:04,504
and chewy homo nuggets.

334
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,504
Just before we leave tomorrow...

335
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,986
we'll have a little party dinner
with fresh local meat.

336
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,109
lt's my show of appreciation
to you all.

337
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,390
Christ, you'll never believe
what l just had to do!

338
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,786
Did you have to drink
some chuck?

339
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,705
Come on, let's find that guy
and get out of here.

340
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,627
Goodnight, boys.

341
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,302
Goodnight, Reg.

342
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:06,428
Oh, Robert,
what a lovely little hottie!

343
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,619
You OK?

344
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,503
Careful!

345
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,026
-Thanks.
-Get dressed.

346
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:51,865
Door!

347
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,061
Well, at least we got in quietly.

348
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,659
Stay here!

349
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,258
Up here!

350
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,659
Got him!

351
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,940
Good one!
Get the bastards!

352
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,340
There's more outside!

353
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,460
Split up!
Send the boy up here!

354
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,059
Come on!

355
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,029
How many did you see?

356
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,464
About eight or nine.

357
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,588
Nah, there's heaps more.

358
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,148
That's one less.

359
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,670
-Ever been in a gun battle before?
-No.

360
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,429
Me neither, but this one's
going to be beaut eh?

361
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,265
Go Frank!

362
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,782
Cover the back!

363
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,509
Gotcha!

364
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,265
Come on!

365
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:40,659
Look out!

366
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,821
l bet that cleared his sinuses.

367
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,427
That's another beer you owe me,
Oz.

368
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,698
Let's go that way.

369
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,339
You reckon?

370
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,064
Too right!

371
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,419
Bastard!

372
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,781
Bastard!

373
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,062
Go, l'll cover you!

374
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,941
Where the hell's Barry?

375
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,099
Aw, sod it!

376
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,298
Oh, shit!

377
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,149
Jeez!

378
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,789
The gun, Robert!

379
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:18,460
Come on Barry,
stop farting around!

380
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,549
Right, let's go out of here.

381
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,982
What the hell is that?

382
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:41,669
-Well it sounds to me like...
-Oh shut up, codpiece face!

383
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:06,465
You three, kill them!

384
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,502
The rest of you get these bodies
on board the ship.

385
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:09,182
-Jeez, they're real dickheads!
-Derek was right all along.

386
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,709
Get him, Oz!

387
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:31,659
Get down!

388
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,862
Oh, bloody hell!

389
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:56,787
Come on, baby!

390
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:05,623
Keen jogger, mate?

391
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,310
Should have bought a Holden,
Frank!

392
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,299
What's up, Oz?

393
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,467
You go on, l'm going to go back
and stop those bastards.

394
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,820
-We're supposed to be going for help.
-You go.

395
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,383
Besides, you're not going
to be back in time to stop them.

396
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,945
Come on!

397
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,308
Good one!

398
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,502
That was my car!

399
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:45,540
Just go to the nearest phone
and call head office.

400
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:52,181
-Hi, my name's Giles Copeland.
-Yeah, l'm Barry, let's go.

401
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,786
That's the end of those
weekend cowboys!

402
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:12,618
Let's go home.

403
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:28,349
Dum dum dum...

404
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:59,299
Jesus Oz, what are you doing?
That's an historical homestead!

405
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,619
Yeah, l know it.

406
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,422
l've got another one here, too.

407
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,187
Wankers!

408
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,660
For God's sake, Oz,
put that thing down.

409
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,861
Let's get in there
and hit the leader.

410
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,788
Hey, wait for me!

411
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:06,543
Holy shit!

412
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,423
OK then!

413
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:27,669
Quit playing with them.

414
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,185
Good one!

415
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:52,262
-Yaaah!
-Derek!

416
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,143
-Bastards!
-Jesus!

417
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:56,943
-He's gone apeshit!
-Bastard!

418
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,828
Let's get the hell out of here!

419
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,870
-Are you all right?
-Get the launcher!

420
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,980
Blast the bastard!

421
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,389
No!

422
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,899
Ozzy!

423
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:01,508
Frank!

424
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:14,984
Where the hell are you going?
Come here!

425
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:50,747
Holy shit!

426
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,183
Derek!

427
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,625
Jeez Oz...

428
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:20,748
Here you go mate.

429
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,349
-l don't smoke.
-Uh!

430
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,383
Bastards!

431
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:00,179
Hello, are you there?

432
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,069
Mummy!

433
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,419
...very well really.

434
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:16,542
But then these pricks
tried to take us on...

435
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,979
but we soon fixed them...

436
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:22,705
Lost all the scummy
third-class labourers...

437
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:24,900
but l've got some great samples...

438
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:28,022
l'll be home
in about twenty minutes.

439
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:29,982
Hold the line!

440
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:31,538
Shit!

441
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:18,543
Suck my spinning steel, shithead!

442
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,786
l'm born again!

443
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,783
l'm coming to get you bastards!
