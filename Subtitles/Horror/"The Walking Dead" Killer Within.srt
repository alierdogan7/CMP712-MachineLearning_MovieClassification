00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:05,279
They found Wells. They got him.
They found him.

3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:06,478
I found you too!

4
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:09,429
I don't trust him.

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,102
Have you ever trusted anybody?

6
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:12,620
He'd be dead if it
weren't for you.

7
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:15,363
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.

8
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,503
You've seen my brother?

9
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,361
Not for a long time.

10
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:19,923
Makes two of us.

11
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:21,313
So, what's your real name?

12
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,552
I never tell.

13
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:24,386
<i>You're just gonna</i>
<i>leave us in here?</i>

14
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,715
From now on this part of
the prison is yours.

15
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:28,740
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,531
Okay, let's get
the other car in.

22
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:46,603
- We'll park 'em in the west entry of the
yard. - Good, our vehicles camped out

23
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:48,437
there look like a giant
"vacancy" sign.

24
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,739
Rick: After that, we need
to load up these corpses

25
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,441
so we can burn 'em.

26
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,710
T-Dog:
Gonna be a long day.

27
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,812
Where's Glenn and Maggie?
We could use some help.

28
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,047
Up in the guard tower.

29
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:02,317
Guard tower?

30
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,819
They were just
up there last night.

31
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,488
Glenn!
Maggie!

32
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:12,326

33
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,863
Hey, what's up, guys?

34
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,364
( laughs )

35
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,567
- You coming?
- What?

36
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,403
( all chuckle )
Daryl: You comin'?

37
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,708
Daryl: Come on, we
could use a hand.

38
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,544
Yeah, we'll be right down.

39
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,815
Sickos.

40
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,276
Hey, Rick.

41
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:52,733
Come with me.

42
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,939
Rick:
<i>That's close enough.</i>

43
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,632
- We had an agreement.
- Please, mister. We know that.

44
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,253
We made a deal.

45
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,277
But you've gotta understand

46
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,248
we can't live in that place
another minute.

47
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,485
You follow me?
All the bodies--

48
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,620
people we knew.

49
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:21,091
- Blood, brains everywhere. There's ghosts.
- Why don't you move the bodies out?

50
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:24,193
- T-Dog: You should be burning them.
- Axel: We tried.

51
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:28,931
- We did. - The fence is down on
the far side of the prison.

52
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:32,244
Every time we drag a body out,
those things just line up.

53
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,070
So hump in a body and
just running back inside.

54
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:37,640
<i>Look, we had nothing to do
with Thomas and Andrew.</i>

55
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:38,975
Nothing.

56
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:42,043
You trying to prove a point?
You proved it, bro.

57
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:45,017
We'll do whatever it takes
to be part of your group.

58
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,809
Just, please, please.

59
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,551
Don't make us
live in that place.

60
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,821
Our deal is not negotiable.

61
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:56,456
You either live in your
cell block, or you leave.

62
00:04:56,457 --> 00:05:01,862
( sighs ) I told you this
was a waste of time.

63
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,698
They ain't no different than the
pricks who shot up our boys.

64
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,734
You know how many
friends' corpses

65
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,969
we had to drag out this week?

66
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,204
Just threw 'em out, like.

67
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:14,106
Humph.
These were good guys.

68
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:18,711
Good guys who had our backs against
the really bad dudes in the joint,

69
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:22,314
like Thomas and Andrew.

70
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:26,118
We've all made mistakes
to get in here, chief.

71
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,654
And I'm not gonna
pretend to be a saint,

72
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:31,590
but believe me...

73
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,991
we've paid our due--

74
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:35,594
enough that we would
rather hit that road

75
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,035
than to go back
into that shithole.

76
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,381
C'mon, dude.

77
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,980
Rick:
<i>Are you serious?</i>

78
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,816
You want them living
in a cell next to you?

79
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,419
They'll just be waiting for a
chance to grab our weapons.

80
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,688
You want to go back to
sleeping with one eye open?

81
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,823
I never stopped.

82
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,192
Bring them into the fold.

83
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,561
If we send them off packing, we might
as well execute them ourselves.

84
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:14,297
I don't know.
Axel seems a little unstable.

85
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:15,698
Carol: <i>After all
we've been through?</i>

86
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,600
We fought so hard for all this,

87
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,134
what if they decide to take it?

88
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,011
It's just been us for so long.

89
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,838
They're strangers.
I don't--

90
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,373
It feels weird all of a sudden to
have these other people around.

91
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:28,843
You brought <i>us</i> in.

92
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,778
Yeah, but you turned up with
a shot boy in your arms.

93
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,516
- Didn't give us a choice.
- They can't even kill walkers.

94
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,718
They're convicts, bottom line.

95
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,354
Those two might actually have less
blood on their hands than we do.

96
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,288
I get guys like this.

97
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,390
Hell, I grew up with them.

98
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:47,060
They're degenerates,
but they ain't psychos.

99
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,363
I could have been with them just as
easy as I am out here with you, guys.

100
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,600
- So are you with me?
- Hell, no.

101
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,602
Let 'em take their
chances out on the road

102
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:57,203
- just like we did.
- What I'm saying, Daryl--

103
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,380
When I was a rookie,
I arrested this kid.

104
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:03,552
19 years old.
Wanted for stabbing his girlfriend.

105
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,911
The kid blubbered like a baby

106
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,648
during the interrogation,
during the trial--

107
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,850
suckered the jury.

108
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,620
He was acquitted due to insufficient
evidence, and in 2 weeks later...

109
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:17,289
shot another girl.

110
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,892
We've been through too much.

111
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:24,563
Our deal with them stands.

112
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:34,205

113
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:38,767

114
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,226
Pretty amazing.

115
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:36,459
If we had more ammo we could
cut down a whole pack of biters.

116
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:42,102
I hear you and Andrea
are leaving today.

117
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,937
That's a shame.

118
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:46,941
We could use
a soldier like you.

119
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,909
You seem like you're
holding your own.

120
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:55,448
Even the National Guard
was overrun.

121
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,251
No amount of training can prepare
you for the world today.

122
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:05,757
You'd think one soldier
would drive away--

123
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,826
especially against
something so slow.

124
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:12,564
Those men were heroes.

125
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,634
Not the kind to leave
anyone behind.

126
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:21,172
If only we'd
gotten there sooner...

127
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:25,208
and you were with us.

128
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,781
Lots of bullet holes.

129
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:35,018
You think biters figured
out how to use weapons?

130
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,591
They must have encountered
bandits weeks ago.

131
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,861
It's ugly out there,
but then...

132
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:47,887
you know that
better than anyone.

133
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,759
It's too bad what
happened to Wells.

134
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:55,003
It is.

135
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,539
Dr. Stevens
couldn't revive him.

136
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:00,742
Merle put a bullet
in his brain.

137
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:02,344
No funeral?

138
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,145
We cremated him, quietly.

139
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,283
These people
have been through so much,

140
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:11,385
I figured, thank God,
at least no one knew him.

141
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,858
Thank God.

Point them facing out.

145
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:34,233
They'll be out of the way but ready
to go if we ever need to bail.

146
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,910
We'll get the prisoners.

147
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:41,314
A week's worth of
supplies for the road.

148
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,515
It might not last a week.

149
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,384
It's their choice.

150
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,654
- Did they really have one?
- Hey, hey.

151
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,689
Whose blood would you
rather have on your hands--

152
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,560
Maggie's, Glenn's, or theirs?

153
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,395
Neither.

Twin cylinder.
Is that a Triumph?

155
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,506
Don't even look at it.

156
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:12,443
Didn't want it bored out?
( motor revs )

157
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:16,613
Sounds like it could use a tune-up.
I'm pretty handy with the grind.

158
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:21,752
Heads are leakin'.
I know my bikes!

159
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:23,854
Man, will you just stop?

160
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:26,390
Have some balls.

161
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,203
Just sayin'.

Just take your time.

165
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:02,656
Daddy, don't push yourself.

166
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:06,059
( chuckles ) What else
am I going to do?

167
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,797
I can't stand looking up at the
bottom of that bunk...

168
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,465
Whoa.

170
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:22,910
You know?

171
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,988
I can go pretty steady.

172
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,516
That's a good start.

173
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,151
Want to take a rest?

174
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:37,111
Rest? ( chuckles )
Let's go for a little stroll.

175
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,461
If we leave soon,

176
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,796
we'll got a few hours
on the road before dusk.

177
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,731
Where are we heading?

178
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,378
I'm thinking the coast.

179
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,168
We have the water completely
on one side,

180
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,136
maybe we find a boat.

181
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:56,006
Best thing we can do
is find an island.

182
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,375
And if the coast isn't safe?

183
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,079
Keep moving.

184
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,549
Then what do we do?
Just grow old,

185
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,586
live off the sea by ourselves?

186
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,221
I'd rather take my chances
out there than stay here.

187
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:15,725
Because your gut tells you there's
something off about this place--

188
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,727
About the Governor?

189
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:22,063
It's kept us alive this long.

190
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,733
That's true.

191
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,611
There's enough food in there
to last you guys a week.

192
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,379
Cut you loose when we get back.

193
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,247
Thank you, bro.

194
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,514
Sit tight.

195
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,891
Oscar:
"Thank you, bro"?

196
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:58,865
( engine starts )

197
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,669
- Glenn: Should I take her out?
- Rick: No.

198
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,839
If that armory hadn't been picked
clean, we could spare the ammo.

199
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,565
I'll start making runs.
The sooner the better.

200
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,001
We'll throw as much wood
as we can in the dog run.

201
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:12,144
Won't the fire
attract more walkers?

202
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,345
Maybe we should bury them.

203
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,080
We're behind the fence.

204
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:17,182
It's worth the one-time risk to
get rid of the bodies for good.

205
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:20,352
I don't want to be planting
crops in walker-rotted soil.

206
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,401
I got you here if you need it.

207
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,503
Just take your time
on these steps.

208
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,738
Carl:
Ooh, ooh.

209
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,980
Hershel: You cleared
all those bodies out?

210
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,716
It's starting to look like a place
we could really live in.

211
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:53,951
Hey, you watch your step.

212
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,251
Last thing we need
is you falling.

213
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:00,990
Looky here.

214
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,528
He is one tough son of a bitch.

215
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,164
( chuckles )

216
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,900
- All right, Hershel!
- Shh!

217
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:12,501
Keep your cheers down.

218
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:13,684
( growling )

219
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,579
Oh, man. Can't we just
have one good day?

220
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,943
You're doing great, Daddy.

221
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,646
Ready to race, Hershel?

222
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,781
Give me another day.

223
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:32,620
I'll take you on.
<i>( Carl chuckles )</i>

224
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:36,790
Grab the rest of the bodies...
( chuckles )

225
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:06,284
( growling )
Walkers! Look out!

226
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,422
No!

227

Get out!

230
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,772
Get out of there!

231
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:24,973
No!

232
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,070
Lori!

233

234

Keys!

240
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,874
That gate is open!

241
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,780
Lori! Here!

242
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,624
Come on!

243

Get out of my way!

245
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,116
Daryl:
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

246
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,195
Axel: Hey, bro, what about us?

247
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,496
( growls )

248
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,732

No!

250
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:17,674
Hurry!

251
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:28,636
[ both laugh ] I circled where you can find
that farm I was staying at with Daryl.

252
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:34,209
Ah, you were right off Route 9

253
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,147
right before it becomes
Dahlonega Highway.

254
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,115
And you're saying that the farm

255
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,615
is only about a day's
walk from there?

256
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,717
Give or take.

257
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:45,652
This is where
we looked for Sophia.

258
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:48,322
Even made it up around here.

259
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,228
How come we never hooked up?

260
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:58,031
You called me a whore...

261
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,698
and a rugmuncher.

262
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,668
( chuckles ) Got a way
with words, don't I?

263
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:05,371
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

264
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,674
Why are you doing this?

265
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,846
I'd want the same thing if
it was my family out there.

266
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,351
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- Mmm.

267
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:21,920
You ain't curious
about the old gang?

268
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,391
Oh...!

269
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,393
Oh yeah, you really was
cut loose, weren't you?

270
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:33,097
I'm sure they came back.
I didn't stick around to find out.

271
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,267
Ain't that a big ol' pig sack?

272
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,571
We got something
in common, blondie.

273
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,374
We got left behind
by the same people...

274
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,042
and saved by another.

275
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,814
Have you ever thought
about leaving this place?

276
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,017
( sighs )

277
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,852
Never had a reason to.

278
00:19:56,854 --> 00:19:59,422
So the Governor is a good man?

279
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,325
Let me just
put it this way--

280
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:06,061
I wasn't in the best
of shape when he found me.

281
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:08,830
He should have
just kept on going.

282
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:13,302
Yeah, he's a good man.

283
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,343
Let's go.
Pull it!

284
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,312

285
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,748
- What the hell happened?
- Beth: The gate was open!

286
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,317
Where's Lori, Carl--
everyone else?

287
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,719
Maggie led Lori and
Carl into C block.

288
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,321
- Beth: And T was bit!
- Anyone else?

289
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:34,788
- Beth: <i>I couldn't tell.</i>
<i>- Stay put.</i>

( gurgles )

291
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,031
Those chains didn't
break on their own.

292
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:46,066
Someone took an ax
or cutters to 'em.

Back up!

How the hell could
this be happening?

303

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
It has to be the backup generators.

304
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,701
Well, how do you turn those on?

305
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:26,403
There's three that's connected
to a diesel tank, okay?

306

<i>Each one controls a certain
part of the prison.</i>

307
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,001
The hatch shut them all off
when the prison was overrun.

308
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,342
Can someone open up the
main gates electronically

309

- with full power?
- I only went in a few days.

310

- Come with us!
- Glenn: Let's go!

312
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,587
There's a set of double doors

313
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:44,881
that will lead to a corridor

314
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,431
that will get you back
to our cell block.

- I'm getting you there!

I'll do what I have to.
You're not becoming one of those things.

318
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:57,165
- I can't ask that.
- It's the pact, remember?

319
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,267
This is God's plan.

320

He'll take care of me.
Always has.

00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:30,481
You can track
with the best of 'em,

355
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:32,651
it's like a needle
in a haystack.

356
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,487
She told me where I could
find that farmhouse

357
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,556
they were holed up in.

358
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:44,928
He could be anywhere.
- I know my brother.

359
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:48,966
If he's out there,
I'll be able to find him.

360
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:55,275
What if someone gets hurt
during this search, huh?

361
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:59,018
We almost had in
the crowley last time.

362
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:03,445
Then I'll go on my own.

363
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,416
I get what you're
feeling, I really do,

364
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:09,434
but I can't risk it.
I need you here.

365
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:14,290
This whole place would
fall apart without you.

366
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:18,727
This is my brother.

367
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,365
Tell you what, huh?

368
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:28,070
You get more concrete
information, I'll go with you myself.

369
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,406
All right?

370
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:39,714
<i>( alarm blaring )</i>

371
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:43,350
Lori!

372
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:45,619
Carl!

373
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,582
We just took down
five of 'em in there.

374
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:53,094
They were four in here, but no
sign of Lori or anyone.

375
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:55,494
They must have been pushed
back into the prison.

376
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:59,332
Somebody is playing games!

377
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,201
We'll split up
and look for the others.

378
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:04,604
- Whoever gets to the generators first,
shut 'em down! - Let's go!

379
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:09,808
( grunts )
What are those alarms?

380
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:12,111
Don't worry about it.

381
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,280
Carl: What if it attracts them?
( Lori panting )

382
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,883
- Maggie: Lori, let's lay you down.
- No-- the baby's coming now.

383
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:20,119
We have to get back to our cell block
to have Hershel help.

384
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,620
Maggie: <i>We can't risk
getting caught out there.</i>

385
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,755
You're gonna need to give
birth to this baby here.

386
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:26,224
Great.
( panting )

387
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:27,825
What is she doing?
Can't she breathe?

388
00:26:27,826 --> 00:26:29,906
She's fine.
Come here-- let's get your pants off.

389
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,310
Okay.

390
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:35,667
<i>( Lori grunts ) Okay.</i>

391
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:41,004
You're gonna need to help deliver your
brother or sister. You up for it?

392
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,118
*** save her doll. I did

393
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,212
- Okay.
- Do you know how?

394
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,148
Dad taught me, but trust
me, it's my first time.

395
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:53,616
( grunts )

396
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:56,491
- I can't tell.
- I gotta push.

397
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:57,460
- Okay.
- I gotta push.

398
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:01,491
( grunts, huffs )

399
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:04,294

401
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:09,364
Somebody!

402
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,053
- I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Okay.

403
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:15,437
- Maggie: You're doing great,
Lori. Just keep doing it.

404
00:27:15,438 --> 00:27:18,307
Your body knows what to do.
Let it do all the work.

405
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:22,544
( Lori yelps )

406
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:23,928
You're doing great.

407
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:29,583
( grunts )

408
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:30,985
Lori, don't push-- stop.
Something's wrong.

409
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:32,921

410
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,217

413
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,267
Oh, shit.
Go back!

414
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:49,002
- T-Dog: No. We're close. We're close!
- No!

415
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:51,905

416
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:55,976
Go! Go!

417
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:59,511
Go! Go!

418
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,512

00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:05,285
Go! I'm dead!

<i>( bottles clink )</i>

421
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:14,129
Sorry to see you leave.

422
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,832
This place isn't for everybody.

423
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:22,270
Thank you...
for everything.

424
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:23,972
Where are you planning to go?

425
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:25,974
The coast.

426
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:28,242
Michonne thinks it'll be safer.

427
00:28:30,512 --> 00:28:33,214
What do you think?

428
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:38,752
Her vigilance has kept you
both alive.

429
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,021
<i>( stopper pops )</i>

430
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,823
Oh-- I haven't had
hard liquor in a while.

431
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:45,625
My tolerance is probably
close to nil.

432
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,536
Lucky you.

433
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:51,785
Merle told me you provided information
about his brother's whereabouts.

434
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,101
What I could.
It wasn't much.

435
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:57,270
Well, it's given him hope.

436
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,805
If you ask me, I don't
think he'll find him.

437
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:04,109
- But he's gotta look--
- Governor: Gotta look.

438
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,017
What about you?

439
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:13,785
Think you'll find
what you're looking for?

440
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:18,122
- I'm sorry?
- You still got family out there?

441
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,460
I lost my family.

442
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,363
My parents, my sister.

443
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:29,889
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:33,636
Lost my wife--
car accident.

445
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,905
18 months before all this.

446
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,643
Just my daughter and me.

447
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:47,717
To better days.

448
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:56,625

450
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:05,533
Ahh.
This is good.

451
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:12,456
The truth is, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

452
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,577
For the longest time,
it was all about survival.

453
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:17,545
Nothing else mattered.

454
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:19,914
So much so...

455
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:23,317
I don't know what matters now.

456
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,753
Pay off the car,

457
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:28,522
work 50 hours a week,
get married,

458
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:31,826
buy a house-- that was survival
for many not long ago.

459
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:37,697
A lot's changed.

460
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:39,966
The scenery has.

461
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:42,269
The landscape.

462
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:45,672
But the way we think...

463
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,214
I better go.

464
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:57,016
But I appreciate the drink.

465
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:59,204
Sure.

466
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:03,122
Merle will see you out and he'll
have your weapons waiting for you.

467
00:31:05,325 --> 00:31:07,860
Remember--

468
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,128
if it gets tough out there,

469
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,197
you're always welcome here.

470
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:14,432
That's very kind.

471
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:17,035
- Thank you, Governor.
- Philip.

472
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:19,103
I thought you never
told anybody your name.

473
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:21,506
Someone recently told me
never to say never, so...

474
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:23,441
( chuckles )

475
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:25,842
Well...

476
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,978
take care.

477
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,952
Goodbye.

Mom, look at me, look at me.
Keep your eyes open.

497
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:48,143
We have to get you back to Dad.

498
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:49,878
I'm not gonna make it.

499
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,314
Lori, with all this blood, I don't
even think you're fully dilated yet.

500
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:54,149
No amount of pushing
is gonna help.

501
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,753
I know what it means, and
I'm not losing my baby.

502
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:00,288
You've gotta cut me open.

503
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:05,360
- No. I can't.
- <i>You don't have a choice.</i>

504
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:07,595
- I'll go for help.
- No!

505
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:11,696
Look, Carol is the one
that practiced that.

506
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,534
Dad only taught me the steps, Lori.

- Please. - <i>I have no anesthetic,</i>
<i>no equipment--</i>

I thought we had an agreement.

We can always leave tomorrow
or the following day.

The following day?

00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:49,479
We don't want to walk into trouble
that we can't get out of.

- Michonne, it is just a day or two.

Baby, I don't want you
to be scared, okay?

<i>This is what I want.</i>
<i>This is right.</i>

528
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:22,477
Now you-- you take care of
your daddy for me, all right?

529
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:24,980
And your little brother
or sister, you take care--

00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:26,314
You don't have to do this.

531
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,416
You're gonna be fine.

532
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,952
You are gonna beat this world.
I know you will.

533
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:33,054
You are smart,
and you are strong,

534
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:36,924
and you are so brave,
and I love you.

535
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:39,260
I love you too.

536
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,530
You gotta do
what's right, baby.

537
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:49,236
You promise me, you'll
always do what's right.

538
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:51,771
It's so easy to do the
wrong thing in this world.

539
00:35:54,775 --> 00:35:57,110
So don't--

540
00:35:57,111 --> 00:36:00,892
so if it feels wrong,
don't do it, all right?

541
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,000
If it feels easy don't do it.

542
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,384
Don't let the world spoil you.

543
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:10,122
You're so good.

544
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:16,862
You're my sweet boy.

545
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:20,665
The best thing I ever did.
I love you.

546
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:23,567
( sobs ) I love you.

547
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:27,104
<i>You're my sweet, sweet boy.
I love you.</i>

548
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:35,012
Okay--
okay, now.

549
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:37,548
Okay.
( grunts )

550
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:40,050
Maggie, when this is over,
you're gonna have to--

551
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:42,518
- Shh-- - Lori: <i>You have to do it.</i>
<i>It can't be Rick.</i>

552
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:49,059
All right...
all right.

553
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,462
It's all right.
It's all right.

554
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:53,529
Whew...

555
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:05,540
Whew...
Good night, love.

556
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,064
I'm sorry.

557
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:13,982
( screams )

558
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,052
What are you doing to her?

559
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:20,688
( shudders )

560
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:26,226
Carl, give me your hands.

561
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:27,961
Carl, please.

562
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,363
You should keep the
site clean, okay?

563
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:31,698
I cut too deep,
I'm gonna cut the baby.

564
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:39,273
Okay, come on...

565
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,674
I see it.
I see the ears.

566
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:43,276
<i>I'm gonna pull it out.</i>

567
00:37:45,078 --> 00:37:47,675
<i>I can't tell if this is
the arm or the leg.</i>

568
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,337
Well, pull the baby out.

569
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,286
<i>( fluid splattering )</i>

570
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:55,354
Okay...

571
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:20,978
<i>( squelching )</i>

572
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:23,580
- ( infant cries )
- ( Carl gasps )

573
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:29,420
( crying )

574
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,395
- We have to go.
- We can't just leave her here.

575
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:43,967
She'll turn.

576
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,901
- No.
- Carl...

577
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:50,038
She's my mom.

578
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,608
( crying )

579
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,920
( sobbing )

580
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:11,226
No more kids stuff.

581
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:13,727
People are gonna die.

582
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:16,163
I'm gonna die...

583
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:17,965
Mom...

584
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:23,203
There's no way you can
ever be ready for it.

585
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,505
( sobs )

586
00:39:41,287 --> 00:39:44,223
<i>( gunshot echoes )</i>

587
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:28,364

588
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:30,899
( gunshot pops )

589
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:04,564
- Hershel!
- Hershel: You didn't find them?

590
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,973
Glenn: We thought maybe
they came back out here.

591
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:12,071
- What about T? Carol?
- They didn't make it.

592
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:15,308
That doesn't mean the others didn't.
We're going back.

593
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:17,242
Daryl and Glenn, you come with--
<i>( infant crying )</i>

594
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:54,043
( sobs )

595
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,513
Where-- where is she?
Where is she?

596
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,251
No...
Rick, no!

597
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,593
Oh, no. No!

598
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:18,313
