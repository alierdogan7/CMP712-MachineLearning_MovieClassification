1
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:35,784
There must be some spell
I can say to undo all this.

2
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,369
You have to bury it deep

3
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,496
below the place where
your journey began.

4
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,715
Just keep on breathing, okay?

5
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,846
I've been wanting to...

6
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:54,361
get closer to you?

7
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:55,596
- Well, hey there!
- Hello.

8
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:56,930
So are you two together or...?

9
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:59,656
Nah, he's got a girlfriend though.

10
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,104
Amanda, what the hell happened?

11
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:05,147
Your hand,

12
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,191
grew another you.

13
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,694
Lookin' for me?

14
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,280
- Time... to...
- Time... to...

15
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,991
- die!
- die!

16
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:37,638
What the fuck?

17
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,139
Is goin' on?

18
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,282
Son of a bitch!

19
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,544
Holy shit.

20
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,753
Two Ashes?

21
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,089
Easy kids.

22
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,382
No need to jump the gun here.

23
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,801
Yeah, yeah, don't shoot
the wrong guy, dummies.

24
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,011
Oh, you buyin' this shiny turd?

25
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,555
This is the guy who killed Fisher.

26
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,223
Come on, take him out!

27
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,391
I did not!

28
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,434
That guy killed Fisher. Take him down!

29
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,644
Well of course he's gonna say that,

30
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:26,645
he's a murderer.

31
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,063
Pablo,

32
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,481
just kill the guy and I'll get you

33
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,191
a piñata or whatever.

34
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,818
Subtle racism?

35
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,403
But not that subtle.

36
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,572
Hey hey, I'm a racist, too.

37
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,115
Asian babies creep me out,

38
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,908
but, unlike Mister Imposter here,

39
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,077
I know stuff about your past.

40
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,495
Stuff that only you told me.

41
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,122
Pablo, till you were nine,

42
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,207
your best friend was a kitty cat.

43
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,251
Notorious C.A.T.

44
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,086
Anybody can figure that crap out!

45
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,421
Kelly, when you were
in junior high school,

46
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,589
you told me you busted

47
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,132
a stained glass window of a church.

48
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,717
By accident.

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,801
Then you punched a nun in the face.

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,889
She was being so dramatic
about that stained glass,

51
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,390
and she hit me first.

52
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,726
Okay, look. Just shoot us both.

53
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,727
What?

54
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:08,103
Yeah, it's the only way.

55
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,646
That way this ass-wipe is dead,

56
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,107
and I don't have to deal with
this horse shit anymore.

57
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:15,402
Come on.

58
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:16,528
All right.

59
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,780
Oh, oh, no, no, no!

60
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:25,557
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

61
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,087
Okay, how'd you know
it was really me?

62
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,757
Well, first off, you're racist,

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,217
but not against Asians.

64
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,301
Well, why would I be?

65
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,969
They give such incredible massages,

66
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,179
with those teeny hands.

67
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,973
Also, you tried to take
the easy way out.

68
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,183
Total Ash move.

69
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,434
What? Come on.

70
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,478
The only person
you're willing to lay down

71
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,563
and die for is you.

72
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,774
Well, that's because
I'm very important to me.

73
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,734
Yeah, we definitely
shot the right one.

74
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,110
I'm reconsidering.

75
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:01,698
Still, I might've
given my life for her.

76
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,660
God, we would've made
such a handsome couple.

77
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:08,205
So, how did that happen?

78
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,748
My asshole hand.

79
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,084
It came back, grew another me.

80
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,585
Same shit, different day.

81
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,003
Things were goin'
fine with Amanda too,

82
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,296
but that went south.

83
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,131
All because of that goddamn book.

84
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,758
No disrespect.

85
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,718
You were the one who read from it.

86
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,136
No disrespect Kelly.

87
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,430
If you live in the past,
you hurt the future.

88
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,391
Now this Book has some
freaky weird power.

89
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,727
The sooner it's six feet
under, the better.

90
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,062
First we gotta deal
with these bodies.

91
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,732
We can't have Hot and Sexy
comin' back to ruin our day.

92
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,027
And I say that with
all due respect to her.

93
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,947
Well, brains before beauty.

94
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:43,925
Hello!

95
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,039
Shit.

96
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,666
We got company.

97
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,835
Happy campers comin' at ya.

98
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,128
Hello?

99
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,702
Hey.

100
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:02,926
What are you guys doin' here?

101
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,386
Brad got us lost.

102
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:05,721
It wasn't my fault.

103
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,472
The-the trees, they...

104
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,682
you know it's like the trail map

105
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,975
just stopped making sense.

106
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,654
Can we crash here maybe?

107
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,813
In this tiny cabin?

108
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,023
No, no, no, the three of us here,

109
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,233
we, we kind of fill it up to capacity.

110
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,194
Plus there's a few dead
bodies in there.

111
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,529
Dead animal bodies.

112
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:25,032
Right, because maybe,

113
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,992
we're veterinarians, really bad ones.

114
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,620
We specialize in a very
radical form of surgery.

115
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,247
Or we're just hunters.

116
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,207
I think the point is,
there's no room at the inn.

117
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,876
So you guys might just
have to beat it, sorry.

118
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,878
But... but-but maybe we could...

119
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:40,714
just camp in the front yard?

120
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,090
Can you give us a second?

121
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,219
- That could work.
- Okay, look, there is no way

122
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,512
in hell they're gonna stay here,

123
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,014
'cause they're gonna get possessed,

124
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,098
then they're gonna
be on the night train

125
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,224
to Kill-adelphia.

126
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,767
With stops in Choke-lahoma
City, and Die-ami.

127
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:55,103
Nice.

128
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,104
I thought you'd like that.

129
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,647
Oh, hey, sorry to
break up your moment,

130
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,900
but we can't just send
them back into the woods.

131
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,151
Who knows what else is out there?

132
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,278
It's a hell of a lot safer
out there than here.

133
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,781
And you're just worried
about the little sister.

134
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,574
Guns, and a chainsaw...

135
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:08,742
Yeah, I am.

136
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,494
Her name's Heather,
and she's super cute.

137
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,913
I don't know much
else about her.

138
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:14,289
That's all you have to know.

139
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:15,582
Okay, look.

140
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,793
You two are gonna take
'em the back way to Elk Rapids.

141
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,960
Man, what back way?

142
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,587
There's a trail right
up behind the cabin,

143
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:21,755
goes to civilization,

144
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,715
then get your asses back
here 'cause I need ya.

145
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,758
In the meantime,

146
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,427
some of us have to slice and dice.

147
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,720
Good luck.

148
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,933
So...

149
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,893
change of plans.

150
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,493
It's cool of you guys to show
us the way out of here.

151
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,246
Oh, yeah, well, anything
to get out of a house

152
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,622
of dead animals, right?

153
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,251
Listen, I know you're not hunters,

154
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,961
or veterinarians,

155
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:03,505
not normal ones anyway.

156
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,006
What are you guys up to?

157
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,341
What?

158
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:11,096
We're gettin' you
and your family to Elk Rapids.

159
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,639
Okay, fine, it's a secret.
You know what?

160
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,640
If you didn't
have a girlfriend,

161
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,850
I'd find a way
to get it out of you.

162
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,145
What do you mean "girlfriend?"

163
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,773
Well, I heard you
were seeing someone.

164
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,316
From who?

165
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,860
From, from her.

166
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,988
Is it serious?

167
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,534
I'm not sure.

168
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,042
- You okay?
- Yeah.

169
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,179
Chopping up my evil clone.

170
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,347
Maybe someday that'll feel weird.

171
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,985
âª Just the two of us âª

172
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,529
âª We can make it if we try âª

173
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:11,907
âª Just the two of us âª

174
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,367
âª Just the two of us âª

175
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:16,995
âª Just the two of us âª

176
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,414
âª Building castles in the sky âª

177
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,000
âª Just the two of us âª

178
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,919
âª You and I âªâª

179
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,280
Maybe I should mount this on the wall.

180
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,917
Ash...

181
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,171
Ash!

182
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,673
Fuck me.

183
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,300
To bury me is a mistake.

184
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,635
No.

185
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,429
No, we are not having
this conversation!

186
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,140
You should use me.

187
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,601
No, I already did that dance,

188
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:23,436
made my life a living hell!

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,106
Only because you're trying to fight me.

190
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:27,566
Stop fighting.

191
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,319
Admit it, you're not all good either.

192
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,739
Be smart, for once.

193
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,741
Use me.

194
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,077
No.

195
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,954
You're takin' a dirt nap.

196
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:45,250
Ash, if you bury me,
you stop being a Superman,

197
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,211
and go back to being a stock boy.

198
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,462
- No!
- Yes!

199
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:51,464
No, not this guy.

200
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,216
I've got possibilities.

201
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,801
To do what?

202
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,261
Have a family?

203
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,972
Become president? Get rich?

204
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,349
None of that's ever going to happen!

205
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,768
I'm what makes you special.

206
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,772
Play's over, Shakespeare.

207
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:20,035
Amanda, I'm sorry for,
what I must do to you.

208
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,078
Promise I'll be a gentleman
and respect your modesty,

209
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,498
while I cut you into small pieces.

210
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,711
Well, maybe just one last
little peek at those...

211
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:31,997
Shit!

212
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,803
Amanda?!

213
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,393
You know what?

214
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,645
I like the forest in the fog.

215
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,772
It kind of glows.

216
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,523
Yeah, day or night,

217
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,984
there's always something
beautiful out here.

218
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,153
Even if it's hard for some
people to see it.

219
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,489
Hey, I voted for Lake Havasu, okay?

220
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,373
So, Heather just told
me that I got a girlfriend?

221
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:07,666
That's weird.

222
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,543
Yeah.

223
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:13,713
She said you told her that.

224
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:16,383
I did.

225
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,509
- Why?
- I don't think she's

226
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,261
good enough for you.

227
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,889
What's wrong with her?

228
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,140
Come on, you know how crazy

229
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,266
girls can be.

230
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,354
Yeah, I'm learning.

231
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,815
Look, Pablo, I'm sorry, okay?

232
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,316
But it's not a good idea
to get involved

233
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,652
with someone right now.

234
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,986
What, why?

235
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,223
Because life expectancy
is real short out here.

236
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,733
Enjoy the view.

237
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,744
And I don't wanna have
to deal with that aftermath,

238
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,204
and neither should you.

239
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,874
That's not how I wanna live.

240
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,380
Watch out! Stay back!

241
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,548
What is it? What is it?

242
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,278
It was just a... raccoon.

243
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:19,904
Guys, guys.

244
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,364
What the hell?

245
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,492
You know, it-it makes
for real good eatin'.

246
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,077
I've never heard that before.

247
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,454
Oh, yeah.

248
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:31,249
Makes a real robust and savory stew.

249
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,126
We should keep movin'.

250
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,128
Come on.

251
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,425
Hang on! Hang on!

252
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,093
Let's look before
we leap this time.

253
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,303
Get outta
the way, Brad.

254
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,221
Excuse me, but my husband
works in forestry,

255
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,431
and I think you should listen to him.

256
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,891
He needs to stand clear
of the trees, all right?

257
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,310
Why, so you can shoot
another innocent animal?

258
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,446
Hello, pussies!

259
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,824
Ash was supposed to chop you up!

260
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:07,160
Guess he can't do anything right.

261
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,871
No, no, no!

262
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,165
No, no!

263
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,459
No!

264
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,503
Oh, shit, shit!

265
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,637
Oh, God!

266
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,809
Oh, God.

267
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,187
Oh, my God!

268
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:35,772
Put him down!

269
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,736
Drop 'em!

270
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,738
Why, is that what Ash
would want you to do?

271
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:45,198
Oh, God.

272
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,283
"Hello, I'm Pablo."

273
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,577
"I do whatever Ash wants me to do!"

274
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:51,955
"Hi, I'm Kelly!"

275
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,039
"I do whatever Ash"

276
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,707
"wants me to do, too."

277
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,292
"Hello Kelly,"

278
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,669
"do you love me?"

279
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,045
"'Cause I love you!"

280
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,214
"I love you,
I love you, I love you!"

281
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:02,215
"I love you, I love you!"

282
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,717
Shut up!

283
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,011
Shut up!

284
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,501
- Get off!
- No!

285
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,825
You're next, hot stuff!

286
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,909
Leave her alone!

287
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,633
Before you die, I want you to know,

288
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,551
there is no heaven.

289
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,307
I'm gonna peel the skin
off your pretty little face!

290
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:35,934
Get away from her!

291
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,947
It's time your loyalty
to Ash got rewarded.

292
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,217
You!

293
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,469
Amanda.

294
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,262
Ruby.

295
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,473
Ash did this to me.

296
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,557
Don't trust her!

297
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,726
She's lying!

298
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,728
The truth.

299
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,946
The truth is...

300
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:35,201
we could still be together,
if you want.

301
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,537
Well I'd like that.

302
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
But our time has not yet come.

303
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,016
Did you really have to do that?

304
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,893
Amateurs.

305
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:03,479
Who the hell is that?

306
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,692
My, my leg, I...

307
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,038
I'm almost done.

308
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,540
This isn't real. It can't be happening.

309
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,708
I wish you were right.

310
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,919
Better tell Goldilocks
to shut her baby blues.

311
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:31,257
This fairy tale's about
to get real bloody.

312
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,717
Jeez, just stop it!

313
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,926
What are you doing?

314
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:34,969
It's okay.

315
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,804
Listen, we gotta chop 'em up...

316
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,309
or else they could come back
as somethin' much worse.

317
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,102
Nothing is worse than this.

318
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,687
Trust me,

319
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,439
everything is worse than this.

320
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,694
So who the hell are you,
and what do you want with Ash?

321
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,862
I'm the one who's gonna stop him

322
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,114
turning more people
into monsters.

323
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:56,866
What the hell are
you talking about?

324
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,606
Ash doesn't turn
anyone into monsters.

325
00:17:58,607 --> 00:17:59,781
He fights them.

326
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:00,995
Yeah, he's the only one

327
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,872
standing in their way.

328
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,040
And me too.

329
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,209
I stand in their way all the time.

330
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,087
Oh, yeah. He fights them, all right.

331
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,464
He's still got that book, hasn't he?

332
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,258
Necronomicon?

333
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,219
'Cause you know that,

334
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,637
that is at the root

335
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,430
of all this trouble.

336
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,334
Listen...

337
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,601
Amanda was my friend too.

338
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,315
It doesn't matter what
Ash's intentions are.

339
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:35,154
As long as he's got that Book...

340
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:38,783
a trail of dead bodies

341
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,118
is gonna follow.

342
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,458
So take me to him.

343
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,669
Why the hell are you on this property,

344
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,046
and where's the book
you stole from my family?

345
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,882
Easy, Nancy Drew.

346
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,633
What hell are you guys doin',
sellin' tickets?

347
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,968
She's a Knowby,

348
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,012
and she saved us from Fisher.

349
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,389
Well... not all of us.

350
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:44,390
Okay.

351
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:45,683
All right.

352
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,851
Well, number one, it's my book,

353
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,019
has been for 30 years.

354
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,896
Number two,
I'm on your damn property,

355
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,316
'cause I'm here to save a little
somethin' I call "Earth."

356
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,360
You know what I've been
doing these past 30 years?

357
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,070
Cleaning up your messes
so they don't destroy

358
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,949
a giant thing that everyone
calls "the Earth."

359
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,411
And what have you accomplished
in all these years?

360
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:08,956
You put a chainsaw on your stump?

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,374
Congratulations.

362
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,293
You know, it's a lot
harder than it looks.

363
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,461
Name one other person you know

364
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,171
that has a functioning chainsaw arm.

365
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,839
This has to stop.

366
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,507
You've got The Necronomicon,

367
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,759
and you need to give it to me.

368
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:22,011
- So where is it?
- None of your beeswax.

369
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,179
I will tell you this though,

370
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,722
pretty soon it's gonna
be six feet under.

371
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,599
- Oh, you're gonna bury it?
- Bet your bippy.

372
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,725
I found that out

373
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,268
during a drug fuelled trip.

374
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,270
So, your entire plan to save the world

375
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,939
comes courtesy of a bong hit?

376
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,857
No, I didn't smoke the drug, lady.

377
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,275
I drank the drug,

378
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,362
which gave my mind a backstage
pass to the reality show.

379
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,696
I'm gonna bury it in the basement,

380
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,114
then I can finally say to evil,

381
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,950
"Hey evil, why don't you eat my butt?"

382
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:45,952
Wonderful imagery,

383
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,663
but it won't work
if you just bury the book.

384
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,289
That's what my vision says.

385
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:51,791
Then your vision is stupid.

386
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,875
Yeah, you're right.

387
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,335
It is kinda stupid.

388
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,880
Almost as stupid as your stupid face.

389
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,468
Just say one more dumb thing.

390
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:05,554
I'm gonna say a lot of dumb things.

391
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,517
That didn't work.

392
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,060
Okay, okay, kids!

393
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,228
Break it up, all right?

394
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,064
Just everyone take a deep breath, okay?

395
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,274
Look.

396
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,401
If The Book is just buried like before,

397
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,069
then some other fool, like you,

398
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,613
can come along and use it.

399
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,573
For The Necronomicon to be laid to rest,

400
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,993
it has to be dismantled.

401
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,453
- Destroyed.
- Impossible, tried it.

402
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,746
With what, your peashooter,

403
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,607
and your-your power saw?

404
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,416
Don't talk bad about Mo and Larry here.

405
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,253
They've served me very
well over the years.

406
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,172
Sure, they can kill the body
that evil inhabits,

407
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,717
but that spirit just keeps
comin' back, doesn't it?

408
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,594
Maybe.

409
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,971
Yeah, you see The Book,

410
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,431
and the evil that surrounds it,

411
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,516
really aren't affected by such things.

412
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,393
No, you gotta use this.

413
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:54,812
The Kandarian Dagger.

414
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,063
I know what that is.

415
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,858
Yeah, so why don't you
show me the book,

416
00:21:58,893 --> 00:22:01,110
and we'll finally end this.

417
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,820
I gotta talk to my peeps.

418
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,533
All right, guys.

419
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:08,576
What do you think?

420
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,245
Okay, well, she did save our lives,

421
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,705
and I think she smells kinda nice.

422
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,540
Although I haven't showered
in a really long time,

423
00:22:14,575 --> 00:22:16,500
so I'm probably not the best judge.

424
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,252
I don't know, I mean,

425
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,087
if I've learned
anything from you, Ash,

426
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,256
it's that if something
seems too good to be true,

427
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,050
it probably is,

428
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,344
and also she doesn't smell that nice.

429
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,637
Man, making decisions is so hard.

430
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,348
Let's look on the bright side,

431
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,016
we're balls deep in this shit.

432
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,934
There's nowhere to go but up.

433
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,062
Yeah, up shit's creek.

434
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,521
Without a paddle.

435
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,661
Okay, you have to use
the Kandarian Dagger

436
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,623
to deface The Book.

437
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,502
Literally, rip the face off the binding,

438
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,712
and once you start, you cannot stop,

439
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,547
no matter how difficult it gets.

440
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,758
Don't stop till the facelift is done.

441
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:07,259
Got it.

442
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:08,552
Okay, Book.

443
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,055
It's gonna hurt you a lot more
than it's gonna hurt me.

444
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,973
Ash.

445
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,268
Yeah, I forgot to mention
this thing has become

446
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:18,437
quite the Chatty Cathy.

447
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:19,855
Not for long.

448
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,067
Ash!

449
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,735
No!

450
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,409
Please!

451
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,352
Oh, Jesus.

452
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,942
Okay, now what?

453
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,319
Now present The Book to me.

454
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:09,155
Then the power
of ownership will be mine,

455
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,282
and the ritual will be complete.

456
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,950
Sounds simple enough.

457
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,290
What's wrong?

458
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,250
Nothin'.

459
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,293
Then why'd you stop?

460
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,586
Well, I don't know, it just,

461
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,212
should I say goodbye to it or what?

462
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,089
With The Book defaced,
time is of the essence.

463
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,924
Yeah, yeah, I got that,

464
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,468
but after all we've been through?

465
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:35,389
Ash, you have carried
this burden for 30 years.

466
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,225
Isn't it time you let
someone else take the load?

467
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,478
Just let her take your load.

468
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,188
Just finish it.

469
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,114
Okay, fine.

470
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,657
Sure. Yeah, take it.

471
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:03,584
Chorzem, kumaarizma,

472
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,836
uwarizim aratta.

473
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,177
Fa raga shi ta,

lucera gai suckra.

475
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:21,936
Ishtar dumuzi, Akah Mannah!

476
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,949
I don't think I like this.

477
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,201
Vara ashitar,

478
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,870
bara anasa iktanar.

479
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,624
Whede sighonor.

480
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,833
Haratar!

481
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,637
What's happening?

482
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,441
There's somethin' fishy with that book.

483
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,415
Sherbo livarnar!

484
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,712
Pablo!

485
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,840
Pablo!

486
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:37,761
Pablo!

487
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,308
- Help me!
- Oh, my God!

488
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,059
- Help me!
- Oh, my God! Get it off him!

489
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,771
- Kan draw, ecru-em, finitum!
- Ruby, gimme that book!

490
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,523
You have no idea what you're doin'!

491
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,364
Help!

492
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:55,779
Ash!

493
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,991
Do something!

494
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:01,660
- Help us!
- Help me!

495
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:04,663
Of course I know what I'm doing.

496
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,416
I wrote this book.

Oh, crap.

502
