1
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,752
Bruno.

2
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,078
Let's go.

3
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,560
"I love you, Margherita,
passionately, desperately..."

4
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,393
"I'm not interested in who
you really are."

5
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,589
Listen to her.
- They probably planned it.

6
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,917
They're coming.

7
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,071
They're coming.

8
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,075
Give me a cigarette.

9
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,675
They're strong, what are they?
- Gauloise.

10
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,872
Isn't Tonino coming?
- He's taking the day off.

11
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
Michele.
Bruno.

12
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,798
They're coming.
I saw them, they're coming.

13
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,480
They're coming, I saw their car.
- What do they look like?

14
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,360
They're really fat, with tits
like melons, and an ass like this!

15
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,237
Then let's go.

16
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
Let me have a drag.
- It's a Gauloise.

17
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,360
It's strong.
- Come on.

18
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,960
Let go, it's mine.
- Did you bring the money?

19
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,918
Yes, I've got it.
- Hurry up.

20
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,992
Come on.

21
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,636
"We'll be at the castle soon,
and you'll meet my mother."

22
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,400
Maria, he invited her to the castle.
- Just imagine the mother now...

23
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
She was already upset in
the last episode.

24
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,080
Good morning, ladies.
- She's trying to listen.

25
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,310
Okay, let's go, guys.
- Wasn't he the prince in the other story?

26
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,549
He committed suicide.
- I can't hear it.

27
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,640
The other story was better.

28
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,760
We want to make love,
we're not interested in the radio.

29
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,760
We've been waiting all morning.
- How can I forget?

30
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,354
It was such a moving story.

31
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,159
I like these stories because
they make me cry.

32
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,192
Who's he?
- No, let him watch, he's crazy.

33
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,228
Let's make this quick.
- We have to be quick as well.

34
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,680
Get a move on.
- At least turn off this radio.

35
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,352
No.
Hold on.

36
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,119
Wait a minute.

37
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,713
If you don't pay,
you can't watch.

38
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,634
Barra.

39
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,239
Come in and enjoy the show.

40
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,674
Barra's a peeping tom.

41
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,389
Barra's a peeping tom.

42
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,320
Barra's a peeping tom.

43
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,680
Barra's a peeping tom.

44
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,917
If I catch you I'll kill you.

45
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,236
I'll kill you.

46
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,033
Hi, mum.
- Pick up your jacket.

47
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,233
Someone finally makes an
appearance in this house.

48
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,229
Wash your hands.

49
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,593
You have to take this orangeade
to the lady of the house.

50
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,673
She's resting.

51
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,033
She must be tired,
poor thing.

52
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,676
Your father's been playing cards all day,
and who knows where you've been?

53
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
But it's Sunday tomorrow.
- Right...

54
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm the only who never gets a day off.
Everyone gets a day off...

55
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,308
But not me!

56
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,832
I'm never tired,
I'm everyone's servant.

57
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,640
I wash, iron, cook,
I clean the house...

58
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,551
And what do the others do?

59
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,911
Where are you going?
- I put your orangeade here.

60
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,388
Well pour some out,
and bring it here.

61
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,236
Hurry up, I'm thirsty.
- Yes, yes, I'm coming!

62
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,993
Go on, look at me.

63
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,835
Had a good look?

64
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,989
Is it the first time you've
seen a woman naked?

65
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,629
No.

66
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,395
Tell me...

67
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,397
How many girls have you slept with?

68
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,918
A lot!
- No, you're a liar.

69
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,680
If you said one or two
I'd have believed you...

70
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,120
But if you say a lot
then it's not true.

71
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,633
You're a real chatterbox.

72
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,915
Would you like to do it with me?

73
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,757
Come on, answer me.

74
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,029
Yes.

75
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,118
I'm sure you would.

76
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,638
Michele.

77
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,715
Yes, mum.

78
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,793
I'm coming.

79
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,629
Go on, run to mummy.

80
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,120
What's wrong with you tonight?
Shut up.

81
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,156
You never let me sleep.

82
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,033
"The search for little Bruno Locascio..."

83
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,920
"Continued all day yesterday."

84
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,200
"Comma..."

85
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,437
"The fourth day since his disappearance."

86
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,911
If they kept their kids at home.

87
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,917
And who gets thrown in the middle?
Us, these poor dogs...

88
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,440
"The search is covering a wide area..."

89
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,440
"Comma..."

90
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,880
"With a task force of around a
hundred police officers..."

91
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,760
"And with help from the dog unit."

92
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,520
The latest revelation came
a short while ago...

93
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,115
It would appear that the
boy's father...

94
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,911
Received an anonymous
phone call...

95
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,992
With a request for a large sum,
as ransom.

96
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,829
Yes.

97
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,676
The investigating officers aren't
saying very much.

98
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,073
Yes.
That's everything.

99
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,599
Stop.

100
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,040
I'm sorry, the deputy public
prosecutor is here, you can't go in.

101
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,270
I understand, thanks.
Relax.

102
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,715
I'll show them what Martelli
is capable of.

103
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,628
But we don't have that kind of money.

104
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,550
Everyone knows.
We're poor folk.

105
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,678
All we have is this piece of
land that isn't worth anything...

106
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,439
And two pieces of bread.

107
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,913
Are you sure you don't have any enemies?
- Enemies? Us?

108
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,072
We get on with everyone.

109
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,036
He only wants money.
Only money!

110
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,033
Six thousand in cash, he said.

111
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,837
Where does he want it?

112
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,310
I must bring it to the abandoned factory,
half an hour before sunset.

113
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,112
He wants me to hide it inside
the third boiler

114
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,830
Who's going to give us six thousand?
- And in cash.

115
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,868
Right...

116
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,709
Of course it has to be in cash.

117
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,269
Did you add that,
or did he tell you on the phone?

118
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,875
No, no...
On the phone.

119
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,875
That's what he said.
All of it, in cash.

120
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,192
All of it in cash.
- Yes.

121
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,432
I'm sorry, prosecutor,
but bear with me...

122
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,520
Think about it for a moment,
if you ask me...

123
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,554
This blackmailer must be a little crazy
don't you think?

124
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,475
Yes.
Yes, it's true.

125
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,112
To stipulate something so obvious.

126
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,960
Sorry, who are you?
- Andrea Martelli, the Milan Standard.

127
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,360
How did you get in?
Who let you through?

128
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,880
Nobody.
The window was open...

129
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,799
Listen, you've pointed out
something interesting...

130
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,278
But I'd like you to leave now.
- Yes, sure, as you wish.

131
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,515
No!
Not this way...

132
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,318
Please, the other door.
- Okay, I get it.

133
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,871
Morning.
- Good morning.

134
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,232
Well, Locascio?
- He said...

135
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,995
That I must go there alone.

136
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,314
And if I tried anything,
he said...

137
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,069
He said he'd kill him!
- He'll kill him!

138
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,760
He'll kill him if you
don't bring the money.

139
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,990
My God!
- Don't cry.

140
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,233
Help us!
- We'll find a solution.

141
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,758
Stop!
- Stop.

142
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,836
You can't get away.

143
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,154
Stop!

144
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,600
I put my hand inside, like that, Marshal.

145
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,352
By chance?

146
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,800
I always hide something in
that boiler, Marshal...

147
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
My things.

148
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,879
Listen, who the hell do you
think you are, Barra?

149
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,271
I'm telling you the truth.
I don't know anything.

150
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,600
I didn't even know who this
Bruno Locascio was.

151
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,556
What do you mean 'was'?

152
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,231
Why don't you say 'is'?

153
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,275
Because you know he's dead.

154
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,272
It's true.

155
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,909
You killed him, Barra.

156
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,320
Confess.
- I don't know anything.

157
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
That kid was only twelve years old,
and you killed him...

158
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,078
Confess!
You killed him!

159
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:00,156
I didn't kill him.
I swear.

160
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,232
I had nothing to do with it.
I didn't kill him, officer.

161
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,299
Yes?

162
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,158
It's me.

163
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,840
You just have to check something...

164
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,510
Listen to this voice.

165
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,988
Say something.
- What?

166
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,280
Whatever you like.
You know how to count... Count.

167
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,317
One, two, three...

168
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,512
Go on!

169
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,714
One, two...

170
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,068
I haven't done anything!

171
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,478
What do you think?

172
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,156
Are you certain?

173
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,550
Yes, of course.
I'll keep you informed.

174
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,114
Well?
- Locascio...

175
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,429
He recognised his voice.

176
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,509
Murderer.

177
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,000
We'd better get him away
from here...

178
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,634
Have him transferred to the city.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,438
Modesti.

180
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,993
Take him away.
- You can't arrest me.

181
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm Martelli, from the Standard.
- Yes, I remember you...

182
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,795
But I can't talk to you, sorry.

183
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,814
Did you hear that?
He says the kid was already dead.

184
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:35,028
Don't listen to him, he's crazy.
You said so yourself.

185
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,234
The people want a culprit.

186
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,153
And we have to find one,
before they do.

187
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,438
Then you're not ruling out that Barra
might be telling the truth?

188
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,480
You know he contradicted
himself a number of times...

189
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,440
It's all here, in his statement.
- Yes...

190
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,080
But those contradictions are so absurd,
they confirm he has a low IQ.

191
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,400
You've known him for many years.
- Yes, I already told you...

192
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,196
He has never hurt anyone.
- He finds the boy in the forest, dead...

193
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,597
Then he hides the body,
to extort money from the boy's father.

194
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,760
A flash of genius, from a lunatic.

195
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,511
Right, also the modest amount
he asked for, just 6000...

196
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,710
Seems to confirm your hypothesis.

197
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,314
This one hadn't been molested, either.
- Inform the press...

198
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,156
So we can put a stop to the rumours
that the crimes were sexual.

199
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,000
The only variation between
the two crimes...

200
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,998
...is a contusion on the neck
of the first victim.

201
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,595
Yes, the killer stunned him,
before killing him.

202
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,560
He could've beaten him to death,
but he didn't...

203
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,710
He strangled him,
like the second one.

204
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,600
In my opinion this indicates
a definite choice...

205
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,560
The kind of manic repetition we
find in schizophrenics.

206
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,118
Well, someone who kills two young boys
must have something wrong with him.

207
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,118
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
- We all agree...

208
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,311
The killer is a lunatic.

209
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,793
But even a lunatic,
in his mad logic...

210
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,394
Must have had a reason.

211
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,989
Were the victims unrelated...

212
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,229
Or do we have to start looking
at them to find a motive?

213
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,194
Yes, I probably knew them
better than anyone.

214
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,677
On your head, Nicola!

215
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,840
That's what I thought...

216
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,800
When a priest is close to the kids,
even his age.

217
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,080
Yes, sure.
That helps a lot.

218
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,120
They're better off here,
than on the streets.

219
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,553
Pass the ball.

220
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,440
They must be good kids, after all,
if they prefer God's house to the streets.

221
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,431
Let's say the football pitch.

222
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,720
They're quite devoted to God,
but very devoted to Football...

223
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,000
Very.

224
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,480
They really like you,
everyone in the village says so.

225
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,160
Yes, I know.
But do you know what my secret is?

226
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,879
I'm listening.
- I also play football.

227
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,520
And I'm a good centre-forward.

228
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,480
These are sad times,
people watch television...

229
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,391
They go to the cinema,
that's how it is.

230
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,120
They read newspapers with
those scandalous photos.

231
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
You're a journalist.
You know.

232
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,840
Yes, but I work for a daily.

233
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,555
Then something bad happens,
and everyone wonders why!

234
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,960
No, there's no water.
They turn it off at five o'clock.

235
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,032
This as well.
- So they look for a culprit...

236
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,192
And nobody understands that it's
our tolerance that's to blame.

237
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
What can a poor priest do?

238
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm friends with the news vendor,
and he won't sell certain magazines...

239
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,831
They don't even arrive here.

240
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,077
Go on, take it.

241
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,153
It's a kind of censorship.

242
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,480
Why? Is it wrong?
- No...

243
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,260
But how do you deal with her?
- Hurry up.

244
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,040
You don't need a news vendor
with her around.

245
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,234
Right.

246
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,109
Don. Alberto, what have they
decided in Rome? Can you marry?

247
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,734
The male population is on the
rise again in the village.

248
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:27,909
Well, keep me informed,
this topic really interests me.

249
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,114
How much?
-5000.

250
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,960
She doesn't look like one of
the devoted faithful.

251
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,598
Who knows?

252
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,589
A lot of strange things have
happened since she arrived.

253
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
What do you mean?
- Nothing...

254
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,319
In certain cases one can think
ill of anybody.

255
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,120
And who's she?

256
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,000
Her father is from here,
he made his fortune in Milan.

257
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,920
You know that strange, modern, villa
you see as you come into the village?

258
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,320
That's his?

259
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,840
He had it built just to annoy the locals,
no other reason.

260
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,958
He never comes here.
- Then why is she here?

261
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:12,076
A woman like that,
in a village like this?

262
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,914
Seems she was involved with
a group of drug addicts.

263
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,760
I don't know what happened...

264
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,599
But her father thought a change
of scenery would do her good.

265
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,913
Hello?

266
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,749
It's you.

267
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,353
What?

268
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,473
No, I'm alone.
They're next door.

269
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,391
At this hour?

270
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,200
Of course I'll come.
I'll make sure they don't see me...

271
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,077
I'll climb over the wall.

272
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,030
Your keys, lady.

273
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,436
Michele would like this.

274
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,911
Leave him be.
He's studying, for once.

275
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,474
He ate with us at the villa.

276
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,349
Look at this.
It was on the boy's desk.

277
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,471
Why did you return to the
annexe so late?

278
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,280
We had to wait for the lady of the house.

279
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,300
She always asks us to wait
until she returns...

280
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,320
She's frightened of finding
someone in the house...

281
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,160
I don't know, some thief

282
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,480
Find my Michele.
I'm begging you!

283
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,470
Does the lady of the house often
go out alone at night?

284
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,400
No...

285
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,398
She's only done it a few times.

286
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,793
It's pointless, the dogs won't
pick up a scent in this rain.

287
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm soaking wet,
I'm going back to the village...

288
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,838
Are you coming with me?
- No, I'll stay here.

289
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,160
I'm scared of thieves.

290
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,636
I know it's foolish,
but it's stronger than me.

291
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,920
But you weren't scared to go
out alone the other night...

292
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,600
Between nine and midnight,
if I'm not mistaken?

293
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,592
No.
You're not mistaken.

294
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,916
Of all the things people have told you,
at least this is correct.

295
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,880
Do you want to know what
I did during those three hours?

296
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,160
Nothing.

297
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,238
I just drove up and down the
motorway like a maniac.

298
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,119
For three hours?
- Yes.

299
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,435
It's a great way to let off some steam.

300
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,993
You must have been very nervous.
- I wasn't nervous, I was...

301
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,236
What's the point?

302
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,319
It's no use being so mysterious.

303
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,833
With all the gossips in the village I'm
surprised they haven't told you already.

304
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,197
In the past...

305
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,195
I did some things I regret.
And now I've stopped...

306
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,840
Sometimes I get the urge, and...
- And nobody saw you?

307
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,956
No, nobody.

308
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,556
Didn't you stop to fill up?

309
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,832
To get a coffee?

310
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,116
I don't remember.

311
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,671
What do you mean you don't remember?
We're talking about last night.

312
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,556
No, I didn't stop.

313
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,628
Which one?
- The one with a child in her arms.

314
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,315
The blonde girl.

315
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,870
Is that her daughter?

316
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,760
Yes, her name's Malvina.
It's a pity she's like that...

317
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,196
Just think,
her brother's very intelligent.

318
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,875
He's here.

319
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,478
He's here.
He's here.

320
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,198
I can feel it.

321
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,756
He's here.

322
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,279
The murderer is here.

323
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,593
He's here.
The murderer is here.

324
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,833
END OF PART ONE

325
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,153
PART TWO

326
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,320
Look, Inspector...

327
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,600
She went in to the church when
everyone else was already inside.

328
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,116
Well?
- It's like she didn't want to be noticed.

329
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:13,632
And then?
- She runs away a few minutes later.

330
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,596
Because that's a woman running away.
- Right.

331
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,517
But this behaviour,
this flight from the church...

332
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,520
Couldn't it be explained by the
fact that she practices black magic?

333
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,960
No...

334
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,960
Because, first of all,
she doesn't practice a damned thing...

335
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,160
They only call her the witch because
she's uncle Francesco's woman...

336
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,880
But she isn't a witch.

337
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,960
Besides, around here,
witches, those kind of people...

338
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,755
They're all hand in glove with religion.
- Yes, I understand.

339
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,880
And this uncle Francesco,
is he some kind of magician?

340
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,270
Yes, your honour,
and he's quite renowned...

341
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,838
Just think, people come all the
way from Sicily to see him...

342
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,273
And all around Italy.

343
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,994
I thought magicians earned more.
- They earn!

344
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,360
Uncle Francesco has a bank account
just like the rest of us...

345
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,760
He's here because he likes it.

346
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,758
He's spent his whole life
in these mountains.

347
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,909
I don't understand these people.

348
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,119
Greetings, uncle Francesco.
- Long live Italy, son.

349
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,920
Isn't the witch here?

350
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,320
If you can't see her, son,
then it means she's not here.

351
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,436
When will she be back?

352
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,512
Saint Giuliano knows.

353
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,790
I haven't seen the witch for two weeks.

354
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,795
And why is that?

355
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,317
Who's he?
- He's an officer of the law.

356
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,380
If you're looking for the witch
you're wasting your time...

357
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,760
She doesn't do anything bad,
and doesn't know anything bad.

358
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,548
Remember what uncle Francesco's says.

359
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,840
You haven't seen her for a while...

360
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,258
But you're not worried.

361
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,676
You're not looking for her.

362
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,753
I looked for her,
but she didn't want to be found.

363
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,600
The last time,
I think it was Friday...

364
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,351
Saint Rocco came to me in a dream and
he told me she was in the oak forest.

365
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,795
And?
- And then...

366
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,880
I went to have a look.

367
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,072
It rained, the sun went down,
and it was night.

368
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,155
Did you see anyone in the oak forest?
- I saw the night...

369
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,360
And nothing else.

370
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,074
Saint Rocco is a liar.

371
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,915
You can only trust Saint Biaggio.

372
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,396
He never lies to you.

373
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,795
Uncle Francesco.
- Yes.

374
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,951
You do know a crime was committed
in that very place on Friday night?

375
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,438
I know.

376
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,280
Listen...

377
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,995
If Saint Biaggio tells me who did it...

378
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,835
I'll tell you straight away.

379
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,840
If he's messing with us
I'll lock him up!

380
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,669
Right, that way we'll start
a revolution in Centura.

381
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,710
Listen, uncle Francesco...

382
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,316
We just want to ask you a
few questions about the witch.

383
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,238
It's been two weeks since
she disappeared.

384
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,715
When is she coming back?

385
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,679
Only Saint Biaggio and
Saint Sebastian know that.

386
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,592
Long live Italy.

387
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,480
If he was telling the truth...

388
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,640
Only Saint Rocco, Saint Biaggio,
and the Holy Father know for sure.

389
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,200
Perhaps he really doesn't
know where she is...

390
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,756
But one thing is certain,
that woman must have a reason to hide.

391
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,390
Strange pairing, Inspector.
- Yes, very strange.

392
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,320
"Take this down..."

393
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,320
"In latest developments, a contingent
of state police has arrived here..."

394
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,480
"Comma..."

395
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,920
"From the regional capital.
Full stop."

396
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,040
"Evidently, these men will be
used in a search..."

397
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,160
"Comma..."

398
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,716
"Which, at this moment,
seems pointless..."

399
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,317
"Given that, thank God,
no more children have gone missing."

400
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,100
You asked me about
Don Aurelia Vallone...

401
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,760
She's over there,
with the girl in her arms.

402
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,712
That's her?
I saw her in church earlier.

403
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,560
What is she like?

404
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,797
We only respect her because
she's the priest's mother.

405
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,277
Hello, Inspector.
I know where the witch is hiding.

406
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,319
Yes.

407
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,880
Sure, I know the place.

408
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,039
Who is this?
- A friend of justice.

409
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,840
We should've known...

410
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
She saw us coming and she ran off.

411
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,789
She can't have gone far.
- Tell the helicopter we're continuing.

412
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,750
Come on, guys, we're heading back.
- Okay, I'll tell the others.

413
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,279
The dog has picked up a scent.

414
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,920
The witch's son, you say?
- Yes.

415
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,440
...and uncle Francesco.

416
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,790
I'm talking about fifteen years ago.

417
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,760
She was just a girl when they took
her away because she was possessed.

418
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,520
There was a rumour going
around at the time...

419
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,349
That she became pregnant as a result
of her chasing away the evil spirits.

420
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,660
But I repeat,
it's just a rumour...

421
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,840
Because nobody ever saw this boy.

422
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,200
Some said he was still-born, others
said he only lived for a few months...

423
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,398
And that they always kept him hidden,
because he was the Devil's son.

424
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,680
And who established this paternity?
- Ignorance, Inspector...

425
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,240
That's what they say when
a baby is born deformed.

426
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,920
But, at the time, Marshal, didn't
you try to find out, to investigate?

427
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,960
If we listened to everything they say.
Besides, I didn't see anything wrong...

428
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,713
After all, it was a family accident.

429
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,840
And these three things here,
I assume you know what they are.

430
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,673
I don't know,
I'm not a witch, lieutenant.

431
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,437
Let go of me.
Let go of me, you bastards.

432
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,311
It was me.

433
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,835
I gave them death.

434
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,600
Yes, me,
to all three of them.

435
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,440
Many times, I had seen Michele
playing near my son's grave.

436
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,635
I watched over it.

437
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,073
The witch puts these flowers here.
- How do you know?

438
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,673
I saw her.

439
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,718
Bastards.
Go away.

440
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,029
It's not your land.
- You mustn't come here ever again.

441
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,630
I'll destroy you.

442
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,433
They had been warned.

443
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,160
But instead...

444
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,796
They came back the next day,
they'd been digging...

445
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,591
I'm sure of it,
the ground had been disturbed.

446
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,480
Why didn't you bury your
boy on holy ground?

447
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,357
I couldn't.

448
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,155
I couldn't, he was the Devil's child.

449
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,318
I told you.

450
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,591
Right.

451
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,311
To conclude...

452
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,876
You killed all three of them,
to punish them, right?

453
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,440
Yes, sir.

454
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,108
And you didn't tell anyone,
not even uncle Francesco?

455
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,400
Uncle Francesco is innocent,
I swear on Jesus Christ.

456
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,470
I asked him how to...

457
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,632
But I didn't tell him why
I wanted to know.

458
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,960
And what did you ask uncle Francesco?

459
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,516
How to do it.
- How to do what? Strangle them?

460
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,154
But I didn't strangle them.

461
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,308
What?

462
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,316
What are you saying?

463
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,199
I gave them death,
but in a different way.

464
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,875
In what way?

465
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,395
I can't say.
- No, you're going to tell us.

466
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,278
Why does it matter?
I told you I did it.

467
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,278
Put me in jail, it's finished now.

468
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,909
No, it's not finished at all.

469
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,196
I brought death to them,
just like I warned them.

470
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,514
Sure...

471
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,240
I warned them.

472
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,637
I'll destroy you.
I'll destroy you, I told them!

473
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,077
They shouldn't have done it.
But they did.

474
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,278
They did.

475
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,829
They called destiny.

476
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,159
I gave it to them, that's true,
but they wanted it.

477
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,040
I warned them,
they shouldn't have...

478
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,395
I'll destroy you,
I told them.

479
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,680
They didn't listen,
and I...

480
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,749
And I...
I made the sign of destiny for them...

481
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,916
Of death.

482
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,675
Death.
Death.

483
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,197
You two, come here.

484
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,079
I made three wax figures...

485
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,314
Then I painted them black...

486
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,991
Because that's the death spell.

487
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,040
I took them...

488
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,471
And I put pins through them.

489
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:27,632
You have to do it thirteen times,
while you say the words out loud...

490
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,790
That you need to say it to
control the demons.

491
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,760
Thirteen demons.

492
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,040
They start off like that,
inside one person's body...

493
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,830
From the mouth,
and then he does everything.

494
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,792
Who does?

495
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,990
It can be anyone...

496
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,714
Man or woman.

497
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,360
Imbalomini, are you sure you're
not confusing it with another night?

498
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,360
No, Marshal,
it was Friday.

499
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,279
You can check the service records.

500
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,754
The night little Michele Spriano
was killed...

501
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,958
I found the witch near the old fort.

502
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,259
How far is it from the oak forest?
- It's quite a distance...

503
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:38,238
It's more than three hours on foot.
- Are you sure it was her?

504
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,880
Yes, I asked her what she was doing
walking around at that hour...

505
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,394
And, as usual, she insulted me.

506
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,190
Okay, you can go.
Thank you.

507
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,480
Are you convinced, Inspector?

508
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,839
The only crime the witch has on her
conscience is the one with the pins.

509
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,880
Yes, I know.
I know as well...

510
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,753
I'm just saying,
let's investigate...

511
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,360
Let's keep her inside for a while.

512
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,320
I'm sorry, Marshal, you're like the people
here, you want a culprit at any cost?

513
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,600
I just don't want any more culprits.
- Explain yourself, Marshal.

514
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,431
What is there to explain?

515
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,920
She's innocent.
We're all certain she's innocent.

516
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,000
Sure.
- Sure, she's innocent.

517
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,033
Then let's release her.
- Yes, precisely.

518
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,194
Release her tomorrow morning.

519
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,476
Yes, sir.

520
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,440
What do you want?

521
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,313
"Okay, what's going on in the studio?"

522
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,748
"We're dedicating this one
to Maria-Rita."

523
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,312
"The producer left me some white wine,
and the moment has arrived..."

524
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,075
"Ornella Vanoni."

525
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,436
An appalling crime.

526
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,195
That horrifies us, that makes us
ashamed of ourselves.

527
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,396
Is this it? We can build motorways,
but we can't overcome ignorance...

528
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,960
...and superstition.

529
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,640
We must find the culprits,
and punish them.

530
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,232
Yes, sir.

531
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,718
Sure we will...

532
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,633
We'll arrest the entire village.

533
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,720
What's going on there?

534
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,312
Imbalomini...

535
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,880
If you'd kept quiet, if you hadn't told
them you'd seen her by the fort.

536
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,599
But it was the truth.
- The truth?

537
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,318
Look at this mess.
Here's the truth.

538
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,592
Who broke your doll?
What rascal did that?

539
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:31,073
Have you lost your tongue?
- Madam.

540
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,720
It's pointless.

541
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,876
She doesn't understand you.

542
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,670
She's mute.
She's an abnormal child.

543
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,276
Dumb, you mean?

544
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,477
Well that's still no reason to play
with a doll without a head.

545
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,788
There must be a toy shop in this village.

546
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,160
Yes, try that stationery store,
I noticed they sell toys as well.

547
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,516
Good, then let's go and buy a new one.

548
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,040
Are you happy?
- Martelli.

549
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,076
I'm coming.

550
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,110
Madam...
- Listen, you can drop the formalities...

551
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,360
My name's Patrizia.

552
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,080
As you prefer,
my name's Andrea Martelli.

553
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,800
A pleasure.
- Martelli, are you coming?

554
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,440
Wait a minute!
Goodbye.

555
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,668
Goodbye.

556
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,514
Let's buy you a nice doll.
Come on.

557
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,318
It's okay.
Don't you want a doll?

558
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,031
Don't be afraid.

559
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,560
Come on.

560
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,920
Let's go there again,
they'll come back today.

561
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,979
Yes, who knows when?
What if they spent all their money?

562
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:47,039
They won't even let you look at
them without any money.

563
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,480
What do you think? These cops
have been sent here for nothing?

564
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,360
The killer is still around here somewhere.

565
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,440
Let's go back.

566
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,076
They just send the cops out to
roast in the mountains.

567
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,760
Not the witch,
they buried her.

568
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,235
You get it?
She can't hurt us any more.

569
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,079
Then let's go.

570
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,320
I've got money.

571
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,040
They did it with Barra and he's crazy.

572
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,759
And they're young.

573
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,909
What are you doing?
- I'm not coming, I'm scared.

574
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,793
You're just scared of women.

575
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,640
Go back to the oratorio,
you like it there.

576
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,631
It's not true.
- Sure it's true.

577
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,389
It's not true.
- Go back to your mummy, I'm going anyway.

578
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,480
Come back.
Come back here, Mario.

579
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,472
Who gives a damn.
Fuck you.

580
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,913
But...

581
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,715
Why aren't you playing?
- I don't feel like it.

582
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,997
He's worried about Mario.
- Hold on...

583
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,160
What has he done?
- I told him to come back.

584
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,160
Just tell me what he's done?
- He went to the haunted house, alone.

585
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,240
Alone?

586
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,069
Don. Alberto,
people go there because...

587
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,312
Because women go there.
- What?

588
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,990
Women go there.

589
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,710
You're so young.

590
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,720
You do these things?
Impossible.

591
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,120
It's not our fault,
Mario went there.

592
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,240
I told him it's dangerous,
that he might meet that horrible man...

593
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,360
I swear on the Virgin Mary
that I told him.

594
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,160
I said, "If he finds you in a
field he'll kill you"...

595
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,072
But he says the witch is dead.
- The witch.

596
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,268
Could you be any more ignorant?

597
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,356
And this is the result...

598
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,958
Mario isn't afraid to walk around
alone because the witch is dead.

599
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,640
No one can be killed with black magic,
no one!

600
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,680
It's nonsense.
- Yes, Don. Alberto.

601
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,720
I told him the killer is still around.

602
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,040
Yes, he is.
- Yes, it's true.

603
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,080
Lord, how thoughtless.

604
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,120
Stay here and be good.
Okay? Stay here.

605
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,348
Yes.

606
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,113
Why did you tell Don. Alberto?
- If I didn't say anything he'd be dead.

607
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,800
Hi.

608
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,276
Do you know how to change a tyre?
- If you give me the tools.

609
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,637
I'll also give you 1000 lira, okay?

610
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,432
What do you prefer, the money or a kiss?

611
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,280
Look...

612
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,199
More than a contusion,
it's a real wound this time.

613
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,270
A violent blow.

614
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,520
If you ask me, the autopsy will
reveal that wound wasn't fatal...

615
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,240
I think he died of suffocation.

616
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,071
Right...

617
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,638
Like the first one,
like little Locascio.

618
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,040
The only difference being he
suffocated this one.

619
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,000
It was even easier.
- The priest found him...

620
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,840
He was walking past,
he saw him...

621
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,360
And he immediately realised
what had happened.

622
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,760
He's still here.

623
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,960
Well, what shall we do?

624
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,800
Shall we question him?
- It's not the right time.

625
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,879
And it would nice if the journalists
could leave him alone.

626
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,199
Marshal.

627
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,638
The locals can't blame the
witch this time.

628
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,000
I don't think so.

629
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,360
It's not a sense of guilt that
you see on their faces...

630
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,952
No...

631
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,879
The only thing that's certain now
is that they're scared again.

632
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,956
THE CLASSICS OF BLACK MAGIC

633
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,551
Hello.

634
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,360
Hello, Montanelli.
- Martelli, thank you.

635
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,916
Right, if you were Montanelli
you wouldn't be here.

636
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,560
I see you're interested in this
type of literature as well.

637
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,279
Yes, it interests me a great deal.

638
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,150
Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you, I can't stay.

639
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,873
Then why are you here?
- I'm returning your lighter.

640
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,975
There are no initials on it,
how do you know it's mine?

641
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:58,111
You're the only one who could
have Cartier around here.

642
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,157
You're right.
They're so expensive.

643
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,954
I'm glad you didn't keep it.

644
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,113
And you didn't even give it any thought?

645
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,317
Actually, I did give it some thought...

646
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,468
About giving it to the police.

647
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,120
Why?

648
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,595
Because I found it there,
close by.

649
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,352
Close to what?
- Don't you know another boy was killed?

650
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,430
Another one.
I don't know anything about it.

651
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,591
But when?
- Right.

652
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,235
You didn't know?

653
01:18:40,435 --> 01:18:42,470
No, I had no idea.

654
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:46,918
How could I have known? You're the
first person I've seen this evening.

655
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,800
Then where have you been?

656
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,916
That's my business.

657
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,680
Listen to me, you son of a bitch,
I hope you don't think I...

658
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,600
That you, at an average of speed 170kmph,
without ever stopping...

659
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,560
In three hours, you would have driven
more than five hundred kilometres

660
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,835
Up and down the motorway.

661
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,874
Yes, up and down,
like an idiot.

662
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,157
Why?
Is it illegal?

663
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,680
Yes, in a certain sense...

664
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,830
By the fuel.

665
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,160
At that speed,
your car...

666
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,099
Can go a maximum of four
kilometres per litre...

667
01:19:27,299 --> 01:19:30,039
So a hundred litres wouldn't
have been enough.

668
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,999
My car has two fuel tanks.

669
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,393
Yes, I know.
40 litres each, 80 in total.

670
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,551
No, madam...

671
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,873
I say you stopped to fill up.

672
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,429
Okay.
I stopped.

673
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,395
Why did you deny it?

674
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,631
Because...

675
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,636
I didn't just stop to fill up.

676
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:07,118
I also made a call, and I noticed that
boy had taken my number.

677
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,519
And?

678
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,111
And...

679
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,872
I called a camp-site,
in Pugnochiuso.

680
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,956
There were two foreigners there,
two kids who had some stuff.

681
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,279
Drugs?

682
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,438
Marijuana.

683
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,034
And I didn't want to get them involved.

684
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,517
What is you relationship like
with uncle Francesco?

685
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,320
What kind of relationship are
you talking about?

686
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,200
I don't have any relationship with him.

687
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,158
So you've never visited him?

688
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,633
No, never.

689
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,516
But if I told you I'd seen you
with my own eyes.

690
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,676
Okay, yes,
I've been to see him two or three times.

691
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,989
I like reading about black magic,
so I...

692
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,595
I'd like to know what I've done wrong.

693
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,150
I've had enough of this village.

694
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,678
I know Centura like the back
of my hand...

695
01:21:27,878 --> 01:21:30,677
Always going somewhere,
just to do something.

696
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:36,560
I can't talk to the people here,
we don't understand each other.

697
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,599
Uncle Francesco might be a scoundrel
but at least he makes me laugh.

698
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,516
You said this camp-site is
in Alberobello, right?

699
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,399
Yes, it's in Alberobello.
But...

700
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,791
I thought you said it was in Pugnochiuso?

701
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,951
Yes, yes...
It's in Pugnochiuso.

702
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,156
What do you want from me?

703
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,671
Just one thing,
for now...

704
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,473
Don't leave without letting us know.

705
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,157
You think I should have told them
he changed my tyre?

706
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,870
I'd be locked up by now.

707
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,877
I threw the lighter away,
I couldn't care less if it's made of gold.

708
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,031
You're a bit crazy, if you ask me.

709
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,360
I'm sorry,
but first you throw away the lighter...

710
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,996
Then you tell me about the boy.
- I have to tell someone, don't I?

711
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,795
And you're the only normal person
I know in this damned village.

712
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,553
Thanks, I'm moved.

713
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,230
I spent a long time trying
to make sense of what happened...

714
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,755
...and these people.

715
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,755
Look at this...

716
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,594
Look at what these hypocrites
are capable of.

717
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,798
ANOTHER CHILD KILLED IN ACCENDURA They make
me laugh, with all their crocodile tears.

718
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,680
They bring flowers to the fountain
where they found that poor boy...

719
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,352
And the one who killed him
is one of them.

720
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,113
And you lot encourage them.

721
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,351
You know something...
- What?

722
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,550
This looks like the head of
the duck I gave the little girl.

723
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,069
Yes, macabre isn't it?
I used that shot on purpose.

724
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,638
Didn't you want to buy her a doll?

725
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:19,149
Yes, but I didn't like any of them,
the only decent one was that duck.

726
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,075
Where did you find it?
- There, on the ground.

727
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,120
Why was only the head there?

728
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,840
Andrea.
- Yes.

729
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,828
Nothing here, either.
- Keep looking, keep looking.

730
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,353
Where did you find the duck's head?

731
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,994
Where you are now,
a bit closer to me.

732
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,395
It's pointless.
- Keep looking, keep looking.

733
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,677
Some kid might have picked it up,
or a dog, perhaps.

734
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,879
I found it.

735
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,279
Well?

736
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,915
Well, it's like I said...

737
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:43,473
That's the priest's house.
That one there, on the corner.

738
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,840
Malvina went out that night,
and she saw him strangle Antonino...

739
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,400
That's why she tore off the
head on the doll and the duck...

740
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,680
Because she wanted to do
the same thing.

741
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,830
Only she squeezed too hard...

742
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,190
She did what she'd seen him do.

743
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,789
It must have had a profound
effect on her.

744
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,555
A gesture of imitation.
- Yes, of course, it's possible...

745
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,030
In fact it's quite likely.
Children do these things.

746
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,956
And Malvina...
You know about her mental condition.

747
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,555
Father...

748
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,955
If that little girl saw the murderer...

749
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,270
Do you think she'd be able
to identify him?

750
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,072
If she had a good look at him,
why not?

751
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,278
But how do you expect her
to tell you who it was?

752
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,750
First of all, she's mute,
and...

753
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,593
No, she's not stupid,
if that's what you're thinking...

754
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,280
She's retarded.
She's six years old...

755
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,516
But she has the intelligence
of a three year old.

756
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,510
But if we question her
in the right way...

757
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,354
We'll be able to find out
if she saw him.

758
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,228
Cigarette, Father?

759
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,439
You'll need a lot of patience,
and a lot of kindness.

760
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,800
Yes, you can just imagine how
nice the police will be to her.

761
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,870
Father, it has to be us.

762
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,790
My son is forgetting something
important...

763
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,274
Our door is always locked at night.

764
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,718
And it's not because of thieves,
it's for Malvina...

765
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,993
Because you never know,
she might decide to go out by herself.

766
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,270
You know how careful I am, Alberto.
- Yes, mother, of course.

767
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,271
I guess this changes everything.

768
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,793
Some sweets for Malvina.

769
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:47,871
The door is locked at night,
so Malvina didn't see a damned thing.

770
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,950
And she pulled off their heads
because she felt like it.

771
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,712
You can save all this rubbish for
your newspaper.

772
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,517
The door was open that night.

773
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,710
She left it open when she went out.
- Really?

774
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,389
And where did she go?
What was she doing out at that hour?

775
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,673
She killed Antonino.
- How can you think such nonsense?

776
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,395
Now I'll tell you what I found out
from the Marshal...

777
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,316
Don. Aurelia's husband
killed himself...

778
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:31,074
The people in the village say it
was his wife's fault.

779
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:32,994
But one thing is certain...

780
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,349
That she was madly jealous of him.

781
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,837
She had made his life impossible.

782
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,678
But where the hell do the
children fit in?

783
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,513
You don't think they fit in?

784
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,231
All four of them went
to the oratorio...

785
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,070
And they stole part of her son's
affection for her...

786
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,198
A bitter jealousy can even drive
someone to murder.

787
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,754
I think that whiskey has gone
to your head.

788
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,955
Hello?

789
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,675
Tell me.

790
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,708
No, she's not here.

791
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,519
Why?
Did she tell you...

792
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,838
No, but she might have brought
you a gift, to thank you...

793
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,918
For the duck and the sweets.
- Nonsense.

794
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,917
Yes, of course,
if she comes here.

795
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,714
No, don't mention it.

796
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:45,158
Who was it?
- Don. Alberto.

797
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,354
He can't find his mother,
or Malvina...

798
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,916
He doesn't know where they've gone.

799
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,389
Do you know them?

800
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,710
Yes, I know them,
but I haven't seen them.

801
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:13,955
Let's go.

802
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,234
We messed up,
we should've gone to the police.

803
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,475
Yes, smart...

804
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,797
Knowing what they think of me,
they probably would have arrested me.

805
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,870
If he kills her now,
it's our fault.

806
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,789
We should've talked to her directly,
we suggested it to him...

807
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,833
We should have kept quiet.
Poor girl.

808
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,189
There's someone there.

809
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,472
Have you seen Don. Aurelia,
the priest's mother?

810
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,875
Yes, just now,
from a distance...

811
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,674
With that mute girl,
at the top of the mountain.

812
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,989
Okay, thanks.

813
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,875
Do you think a mother could
kill her own daughter?

814
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,234
If she's crazy, yes.

815
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,433
Let's get ready to assist in
another nice funeral with a choir.

816
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,915
Cut it out.
That isn't funny.

817
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,630
You don't have children.
- Do you?

818
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,673
Yes, two boys.

819
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,112
Then you also have wife.

820
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,389
Pity.

821
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,397
Please, mother!
Give her to me.

822
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,669
Wait.

823
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,233
Alberto.

824
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,511
No, Alberto.
Stop.

825
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,879
Listen to me.

826
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,593
What's going on?
- Stop him, my son is insane.

827
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,473
He'll kill her.

828
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,669
"Malvina's going to heaven now,
mother..."

829
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,392
"She's going to heaven,
with the angels."

830
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,635
"I'm not doing it for me..."

831
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,951
"It's for them."

832
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,000
"I can't let them stop me."

833
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,194
"I love them like brothers..."

834
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,070
"And I'll never abandon my brothers."

835
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,993
Don. Alberto.

836
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,513
You found her.

837
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,235
Great.

838
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,954
But you must be tired now.
Very tired.

839
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,753
Give me the girl.

840
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,751
I'll take her back to the village.

841
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,389
Will you?

842
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,395
I'll take her.

843
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,114
Come here.

844
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,194
Coward.
Coward.

845
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,389
"Because women go there.
They grow up..."

846
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,235
"They feel the stirrings of the flesh."

847
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,513
"They fall into the arms of sin.
We must stop them."

848
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:53,111
"Sin that God easily forgives,
yes..."

849
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,035
"But what of tomorrow?
what sordid acts will they commit?"

850
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,994
"What sins will they enact when
they no longer come to confession?"

851
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,078
"Then they will really be dead.
Dead forever."

852
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,393
