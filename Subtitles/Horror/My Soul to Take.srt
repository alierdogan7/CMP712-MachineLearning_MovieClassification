BUG: Now I lay me
down to sleep,

3
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,326
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

4
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,198
If I should die
before I wake,

5
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,938
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

NEWSCASTER: Before tonight's murder,
there has been no clue

7
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,837
as to who
this killer might be.

8
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,572
But now the Riverton Ripper
and the knife he uses

9
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,377
have been caught by a
high-definition security camera.

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,712
SARAH: Any day, now.
NEWSCASTER: Police say

11
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,015
that the killer is a Caucasian
male in his mid-to-late 30s.

12
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,646
It's too dark to see his face

13
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,885
but the quality of the image has
allowed forensic technicians

14
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,358
to zoom in and
enhance it enough

15
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,054
to make out
the word "Vengeance"

16
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,825
etched on the blade
of the Ripper's weapon.

17
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,490
No one was in the
area at the time...

18
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,125
SARAH: That's beautiful, Abel.

19
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,596
And Leah's going
to love that house.

00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,432

Come to bed.

22
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,738
The news is too scary
for me to watch alone.

23
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,935
Okay, Sarah,
I'll be up soon.

William Blake.

(GROANING) NEWSCASTER:
Here's what he had to say.

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,881
DR.
BLAKE: The identity of a killer of this sort

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,478
may well not even
be known to himself.

29
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,352
He could be
anywhere and anyone

30
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,756
leading a normal life,
so far as he knows,

31
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,517
and never dream
for an instant that,

32
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,393
every so often,
he turns into a monster.

33
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,056

What's with the knife, Abel?

44
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,448
What's with the blood?
It's really crazy stuff.

45
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,956
It's not my knife, James!
I don't know what's with it.

FEMALE VOICE: Please, Abel.
Blake said it could happen.

49
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,126
A one in a million
chance, he said.

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,599
(AS PENNY)
What if it did?

51
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,863
He said to call him, 24/7.

52
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,098
(AS BRAD) Abel, listen. Call him now.
You've got to call Dr. Blake.

Just look the other way when I
kill and your family stays alive.

Is everything okay?

No, no, no. Everything is not okay.

What did you find?

71
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,346
A knife.

72
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,857
Under my bench.
And not just any knife.

73
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,824
The one on TV.
The Ripper's knife.

74
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,054
I swear before God,
Dr. Blake, I didn't know.

75
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,891
But the second that I went to
call you there was somebody,

76
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,591
and he said
don't call you, or else...

77
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,634
DR. BLAKE: Or else?

78
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,999
What?

79
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,631

kill Sarah. And Leah.

I want you to tell Sarah

to take Leah,
and drive to her sister's.

83

I haven't told her
about this part of my life.

to me you would.

of the agreement.

and Sarah is sound asleep.

No. Not necessarily.
They never found his body.

350
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,398
And nobody really knew him
or his wife very well.

351
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,693
They were new to Riverton.
Yeah.

352
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,965
And, Plenkov could look completely
different after 16 years!

353
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,735
Like, cosmetic surgery,
hair transplants, Weight Watchers.

354
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,273
And he could have
changed his name.

355
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,402
Snuck back into Riverton
to get his revenge this year.

356
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,776

needs shock-and-awe!

365
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,166
It's my fault.
I was too scared about tonight to think about it.

Listen, Bug.

367
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,297
I'm scared of the Ripper, too.
You are?

368

I got to cross that

369
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,598
I do what my
grandma taught me.

370
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,336
Spit in the river, and
he won't come after me.

371
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,435
That works?
Yeah, for 16 years.

about this new curfew.

00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,124
Very creative.

383
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,132
That's why every kid in
Riverton has Ripper nightmares

384
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,224
and the adults have
memorial services.

385
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,135

No, no, no! It's a memorial.
That's why it's still here.

DR. COOPER ON RADIO:
The California Condors

420
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,750
are magnificent birds.

421
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,948
They can fly 15,000 feet high,
cruise at 55 miles per hour

422
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,957
and cover 150 miles
in a single day.

423
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,961

they're often mistaken for small airplanes on radar.

national expert on

of extinction a bit.

00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,477
They're hanging in there.

434
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,713
The California Condor has
always captured the imagination.

435

"It's true that the
condor literally eats death.

is not sickened by this.

to the son of a felon

Edgar.
Seriously?

523
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,036
Yeah. It's your birthday.

524
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,165
Well, thanks.

525
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,675
I should get
you a present.

526
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,372
How about a weekend in Las
Vegas with Brittany Cunningham?

527
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,107
Brittany doesn't
know I'm alive.

528
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,774
She's gonna,
after two days and two nights

of star-studded shows
and high-stakes gambling.

530
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,885
Oh, yeah.

531
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,479
Or I could just
help you with that.

532
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,121
Yeah, that's just as good.

533
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,251
It's heavy.

534
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,760
It's all the fluids.

535
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,023
Fluids?

I shall not want.

537
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,658
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

538
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,760
He restoreth my soul.

539
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,965
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

540
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,565
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

541
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,143
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

542
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,848
Surely goodness and
mercy will follow me

543

through all the
days of my life,

544
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,112
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

545
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,350
Amen.

546
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,590

00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,671

550
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,780
BUG: Hello?
MAY: You like it?

551
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,842
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks, Mom.

552
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,711
I scotch-taped
your number to it.

553
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,617
And mine, and 9-1-1.
Happy birthday, Bug. I love you.

554
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,249
Love you, too.

555
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,420
How do...
Do I close it?

556
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,364
Hit the red button.
Boom, done.

557
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,859
Small!

558
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,061
That bad?

559
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,467
No, that's good.

560
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,766
CHANDELLE: Jerome.

561
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,965
Uh-oh.

562
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
Get, Dunkelman.

563
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,333
ALEX: Catch you
later, Jerome.

564
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,899
What did I do now?
See you, Jerome.

565
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,206
It's what you're
not going to do,

566
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,106
which is hang
out with them.

567
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,273
Why not?

568
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,883
It's bad luck,
is "why not."

569
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,211
Especially
on Ripper Day.

570
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,312
You should totally come some year, Fang.
It was wild!

571
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,323
Like, Brandon set Bug up
to fight the monster,

572
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,450
which was huge, by the way.

573
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,018
And Bug,
he was so scared.

574
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,190
Brandon didn't set
Bug up. I did.

575
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,497
Do you know how to
steam open an envelope

576
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,796
so it doesn't show?

577
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,097
Put it in the freezer
for an hour.

578
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,195
It opens itself and
reseals perfectly.

579
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:44,998
This is to Bug.

580
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,439
Oh, really?

581
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,139
Here they come.

582
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,340
Hold up, boys.
What do you got there?

583
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,347
Happy birthday, insect.

585
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,018
Clueless as usual.

586
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,581
Go.

Mr. Kaiser,

588
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,657
It'll be there.

Thanks, Jose.

590
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,622
So, you want to
come over tonight?

591
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,566
We could burn the house down
with my stepfather in it.

Ha, ha, ha!

He give you anything
for your birthday?

594
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,097
Yeah, a hematoma.

595
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,106
Made it himself, too.

596
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:19,867
Oh!

597
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:24,109
Behold, Bug,
what light in yonder window breaks.

598
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,252
She is so beautiful.

599
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,288
She's hot
for you, too.

600
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,953
You should go over
there and talk to her.

601
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,616
Excuse me,
Officer Ramirez.

602
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,251
Maria told me you know
all about baseball.

603
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,386
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-oh.

you want to know?

this is an eight.

That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

610
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,241
Dunkelman,

611
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,870
stay away from
the Fang Zone.

612
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,347
And you,
you stay away from him.

Not as good as your mother
felt last night, though.

Do not bring the wrath
of Jehovah down upon you.

620
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,934
Your sins are already a stench
in the nostrils of an angry God.

621
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,236
Like knocking up Melanie Pratt,
who's only 15

622
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,242
and the principal's daughter.

623

What? Melanie's pregnant?

She's in my
prayer group. Duh!

What men will do
to you in prison

626
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,011
is nothing compared to what
demons will do to you in Hell.

On beds of fire.
Through all eternity.

628

I'm going to get you
for this, Penelope.

If you do, God will get you, Brandon,
and it won't be pretty.

expect it, Dunkelman.

Thanks, Penelope. Same to you.

00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,096
Did you get my note?

00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,397
Note?

635
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,872
I left it in your mailbox.

636
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,340
No.

637
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,606
It doesn't matter.

your loins, Alex.

00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,635
I don't understand her,
sometimes.

she said that.

What if she meant
the Ripper?

652
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,572
I'm scared.

Like it or not,
we're men now.

655
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,646
I don't feel like a man.

656
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,156
No man does.
That's why you got to fake it.

657
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,816
Fake being a man
to be a man?

658
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,792
That's the way it works.
So, you can't run.

659
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,988
You have to face
your fear like a man.

660
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,087
Even though I'm not a man?

661
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,358
Because you're not a man.

662
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,332
Listen, the better you fake it,
the better man you are.

663
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,469
Just fake it?
Well, fake it good.

664
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,004
Like, if you're scared,
act like you don't give a shit.

665
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,838
Or if somebody hurts you, say,
"Thank you very much. That felt wonderful."

Thanks, Brandon.
I can't raise my arm.

667
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,980
Feels good.
Yeah, there you go.

668

That all you
got, Brandon?

669

downright cheated.

I'm amazed that you're getting this so quick.
It's tricky stuff.

that I did.

were faking it good.

that he built.

1116

not a robin,

01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,866
Or went out Leah's.

01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,111

I scraped it
climbing up the roof.

1749
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:57,534
Come on,
let's get real, here.

1750
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:00,365
BUG: Jay says that Ripper's
getup was a costume for sure.

1751
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,700
Oh, and Brittany
has run a timeline.

1752
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:04,941
You would've had
enough time to kill Mom

1753
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:06,673
and put the knife
in the bathroom sink

1754
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,113
while I was hiding under the bed
and Leah was outside in the car.

1755
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:10,839
And if Jerome came
through the window

1756
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,977
when I was in the bathroom
getting you water,

1757
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:16,490
you would've had time to stab him,
and go downstairs and kill Paterson.

1758
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,585
You might have
tried to kill me, too.

1759
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,560
Fuck.
BUG: But if you'd heard Jerome upstairs,

1760
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:25,360
you would've had to get up
there before he called the cops.

1761
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:30,269
I could've killed you
off earlier, remember?

1762
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:34,502
Bug, you've watched one too
many Law and Order reruns.

1763
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:36,236
Besides,
I'm a little guy.

1764
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:39,077
You could beat me up
in, like, 10 seconds.

1765
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:40,975
Unless you had
the bad soul in you.

1766
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:43,873
And then you would fight
like you were possessed.

1767
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:45,979
Can't fucking believe you.

1768
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:49,649
You're Adam Plenkov!

1769
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:52,349
The son of a mass murderer!

1770
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:53,723
Everybody in your house,

1771
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,763
and all your friends, except me,
have been murdered.

1772
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:59,026
If there's a bad soul
here, you have it.

1773
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,965
And you got it
from your father.

1774
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:02,963
Maybe you have
been in institutions.

1775
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,972
Maybe you have killed people,
just in your last life.

1776
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,700
But you're too stupid
and blind to see that.

1777
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:12,469
Maybe they'll find
your Ripper costume

1778
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:15,379
buried along with
your stupid condor outfit.

1779
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:17,747
And they will come
for you with torches.

1780
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:20,213
What?

1781
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:23,750
I didn't bury any Ripper costume with my condor.

1782
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,482
(AS RIPPER)
Somebody did.

1783

(EXHALING)

1784
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:33,055
You son of a...

1785
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,532
Evil doesn't forget
betrayal, Plenkov.

1786
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:40,506
You and the other
sick Dr. Blake got me

1787
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:42,132
and then ran away
like cowards.

1788
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,268
Jumped into the first babies
you could hide in.

1789
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,972
So I saved you for last.

1790
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:47,305
And I'll kill you now,

1791
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:48,905
or you can say
yes to a deal.

1792
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,177
What deal?

1793
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:53,147
Same one I offered your father,
16 years ago today.

1794
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:56,485
Say yes, and you live. Say no,
and I'll cut your throat.

1795
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:58,452
Say yes to what?

1796
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,858
To my happy ending
of Riverton's fairytale.

1797
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,155
There was no Ripper.

1798
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:03,628
Just one of the
Riverton Seven

1799
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,130
that was a little crazy,
dressed up like the Ripper,

1800
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:09,031
killed your mom, and Paterson,
and four of his birth-mates

1801
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:10,730
before we finally
stopped him.

1802
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:11,965
One of the Riverton Seven?

1803
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,439
The one of the seven
with the bad soul.

1804
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,906
The Ripper's soul.
BUG: Jerome?

1805
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:20,273
Great twist, huh?
Everybody will think you were the killer

1806
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:23,783
but it turns out the attack came
from a totally unexpected direction.

1807
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,508
You'd lay all this
on Jerome?

1808
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,679
He won't mind.
He's dead.

1809
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:29,746
You and me will be
Main-Street heroes

1810
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:31,985
helping each other
forge a new beginning.

1811
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,425
Recovering from
our tragic losses.

Friends to the end.
What do you say?

1813
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:38,691
Deal?

1814
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,361
You're pathetic.

1815
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:44,034
I don't even think
you're Alex.

1816
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:47,372
I don't know who you are.

1817
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:54,648
I'm the one that's going to
kill you if you don't say yes.

1818
01:35:54,715 --> 01:35:55,943
And then I'll say
you did it.

1819
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,818
And I'll be the hero
all by myself.

1820
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:00,751
Leah saw the whole fight.
She'll vouch for me.

1821

Leah doesn't live
through the night.

That's part of
the deal, too.
