Hi, I'm Peter Toland.
Welcome to<i> Toland's World.</i>

42
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,200
This week we're in Elderberry Vale in
Nottinghamshire, a thriving stretch

43
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
of classic English countryside.

44
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,000
Home to literally thousands
of indigenous plants and animals

45
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
including a 400-year-old
badger sett,

46
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,800
which has crisscrossed this hill
for untold generations.

47
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,600
But in the last two years,
the badgers have disappeared because
a shadow has fallen across this hill,

48
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
a shadow in the form of this.

49
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Are you gonna pan off me? Hello? Are you
gonna pan to the power station or--? Man:
Yeah, okay, cut. Sorry, Peter. We gotta cut.

50
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Peter: No, no, don't cut. Do not cut.
<i>- </i>Peter: What's happening? <i>- </i>Man:
Sorry. We lost focus

Yeah? We lost focus? - Or you lost focus?
<i>- </i>I could do with another crack

52
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,800
- at that, Peter, sorry.
- Could you? Another crack. Well,
what's going on? You lost focus.

53
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,300
That's the whole point. That's your job,
isn't it, Brian? Brian:
We just didn't realize you were going

54
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,800
to move around so much.

55
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,700
Of course I move around. That's my style.
There were some quite large movements.

56
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,200
We could whack down a sausage for you,
Peter, if that's-- I don't want a
sausage. Yeah? Shove it up your ass.

Dom, let me explain how this works, okay?

we keep filming.

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,000

Big fun. Fun times. Clue me in. Let's have a
laugh. Peter, the badgers are still here.

77
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,200
The badgers are... No, the badgers are dead
because of the toxins from the power
station. That's what the episode is about.

- But listen, Peter. - Can you hear me?

<i> She's taller than Jimmy?</i>

Both: Shorter than Jimmy.
Taller than Johnny.

376
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,700
Okay, so all these have
to be true-false, right?

377
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,700
Woman:<i> This question reads
"true-false."</i>

378

379
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,200
Can I say "unanswerable"

380
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,900
or "trick question"
or something like that?

381
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:11,000
- Woman:<i> Under what reasoning?</i>
- Man:<i> Well, you don't know...</i>
<i>You don't know how much taller.</i>

382
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,700
<i> Like it could be, you know,
an inch, it could be two feet.</i>

<i>I'm, like, looking at your face
for clues. Uh...</i> - Woman:
That's all right. - Man: So, yeah.

384
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,500
My final answer is the question
is unanswerable.

385
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:32,500
Woman: Excellent, that is correct.
Congratulations, that was a perfect score.

386
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:37,500
If you can come with me right
now, I'd love to talk to you
some career opportunities.

- Hey, baby. - Hey, sorry,
did I wake you? No. No, it's fine.
How are you? How's the hotel?

394
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,200
It's fine. Yeah, it's all right.
It's quite plush.

395
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:56,900
Um, look, I'm sorry I didn't call last
night. I just got stuck with these people,
it was... It's okay. So how was the meeting?

396
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:02,500
Good. No, it was really good. Not
everything is nailed down, but I pretty
much think we've got a done deal, so...

397
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,000
That's great, congratulations.

398
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,200
So are you coming home today?
I miss you.

399
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:14,900
Not sure, there's another meeting this
morning, but... If that goes well,
then I should be on the night flight.

400
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,900
How's...
Is that the door bell?

401
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,400
Well, are you
expecting anyone?

402
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,000
Woman: No.

01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,500
- Who is this?
- Who is it?

406
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,300
Hello? Sir? Who is it?

407

- I don't know. - (doorbell
rings) What do you want?

408
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,500
Who is it? What do they want?
Please go away or I'm calling the police.

409
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,200
(knocking on door)

410
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,800
- What's going on, Miriam?
- Don't know.

411
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,500
Don't know what...
(screams)

412
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:09,400
- What was that? - Oh, my God!
He's got a hammer, he's breaking the door!

413
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,900
(screams)
Oh, he's breaking in!

414
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,100

now please send someone.

421
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,900

are on their way, are you okay?

(whispering) Sh...
I'm in the bathroom, just...

423
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,500

(sobbing, moaning)

432
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,400
Why? Why are you doing this?

433
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,400
(sobbing, moaning)

434
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,000
(gasps) I love you!

435
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,700
(baby crying)

436
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,700
Whoever you are,

437
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,300
please, I'm asking you,

438
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:35,100
- don't do this. - (baby crying)
Please, don't hurt my baby.

439
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,300
Please, there's
a small baby in the room.
Please don't...

440
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,700
Leave my baby alone, please.

441
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,500
(sobbing)

442
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,200
What have you done
to my family?

443
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,100
Woman: Let me talk to him.

444
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,700
What?

445
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Let me talk to my husband.

446
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,300
It's your wife.

447
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,200
(police siren wailing)

448
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,800
All right.

449
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,100
Basically, why we're shooting
your audition today

450
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,100
is to show the producers what
you're comfortable doing,

451
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,300
what you're able to do,
and willing to do.

452
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,800
It's really like
an attitude thing.

453
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,000
If I told you to suck my dick,

454
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,200
would you do as you're told?

455
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,100
Or would there
be some sort of an issue?

456
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,000
Open your mouth for me please?

457
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,100
Good.

458
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,400
(gagging)

459
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,300
You a little whore?

460
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,200
Say it.

461
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,700
You know, a lot of girls would
kill for this opportunity.

462
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,000
So you gotta stand above
the competition.

463
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Wow. Phew,
those are some eyes!

464
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,000
Are you blind?

465
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,000
We're gonna have to get some, uh,
sunglasses for her on the day of the shoot.

466
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:59,300
We are gonna need to see your body.
Unfortunately, producers are kind
of picky about that kind of thing.

467
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,400
So if you could just take off that
retarded dress that you're wearing.

468
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,800
Faster, please.

469
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,400
We do not have all day, do we?

470
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,600
(laughs)

471
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,600
Yeah. Those are okay.
I give 'em a C-minus.

472
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,600
Wait!
What the fuck is that?

473
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,400
Oh, that's a dick.

474
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:42,000
- Man: Oh, gross! - A dick?
Come on, you guys! How many fucking
times is this gonna happen

475
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
before somebody starts fucking
screening the girls?

476
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,400
(distorted voice) Not a dick.

477
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,900
I like dicks.

478
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,200

- What the fuck was that?

479
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,000

- Holy shit!
- (distorted moaning) Oh, yes!

484
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,200
(distorted laughter)

485
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,100
(alarm blaring)

486
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600

487
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,700

I can't believe your phone works there!</i>

493

Oh, hold on, hold on.
Look at this, look at this.

494

that is so beautiful.</i> - Tell me that's
not gorgeous, right? - Woman:<i> Yeah!</i>

495
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,100
It is so good to see your face.

01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,600
Come on,
Dylan loves you, okay?

499
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,300
Woman:<i> What'd you guys
do last night?</i>

500
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:37,100
We literally took a walk,
uh, in the sand,
and we just had a couple beers.

501
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:44,200
Woman:<i> Uh-huh, on your boys' trip?
It's okay, you can tell me.</i> Okay,
three beers. But really, that was it.

502
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,100
Honestly, um, you know,

503
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,200
it's just, we're just keeping it super
low-key. Woman:<i> Right. Oh, is that Dylan?</i>

504
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:57,400
<i>- Look, he's right there. </i>- (laughs) Yeah,
he's here. Hold on, dude, I'm on the phone.
Give me one second, okay?

505
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:05,200
- I'm sorry. - Woman:<i> Hi, Dylan.</i> - Hi, Amber!
- Dude, I told you I'm on the phone, man.
- One second, one second. - Dylan: Okay.

506
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:09,100
Amber:<i> Where are you guys
staying? Show me your room!</i> Uh,
honestly, it's a mess right now,

507
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:13,500
- you wouldn't want to see it.
- You want to see our room? - Amber:<i> Yeah,
give me the tour!</i> - What are you doing?

508
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:19,600
- Baby, I'm going to call you back.
- Let's give her a tour, man! Yo,
what the fuck! Give me the phone! Dude!

509
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:27,100
Give me my phone! Give me... Hang up! Hey,
baby, how you doin'? Amber:<i> Dylan,
what are you doing?</i> Hey, shhh, don't worry!

510
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:29,300
Just want to show you
our place.

511
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:33,900
- Man: Baby, hang up! - Dylan: Oh,
look at that. What's that? - Amber:<i>
What is that?</i> - What's that?

512
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:42,000
- Amber:<i> Are those hard drugs?</i> - Yeah.
Introduce you to some of our new friends,
like this sweet little peach. Mm...

513
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,200
- Amber:<i> Who is she?</i> - Take a look at
that. - Yeah, you like that? - Amber:<i>
Who is she?</i> Ooh! (laughs)

514
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,900
Look at those
itty-bitty titties!

515
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,600
Remember when your titties
used to look like that? I do!

516
01:28:55,700 --> 01:29:03,400
- Amber:<i> Fuck you, Dylan.</i> - (laughs) - Let me
show you what Curt got. - Curt: No, no, no! -
Look away! Look away! - Dylan: Sh, sh, sh!

517
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,200
Did you know your boyfriend
likes smelly, old pussy?

518
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:12,100
Did you know that? (sniffs) Oh!
Wow! That's strong!

519
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,600
Funny story, you know
you get a discount here

520
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,500
if you do both mother
and daughter.

521
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,500
- (Amber groans)
- Yeah, it's sick!

522
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:24,200
- Hold on.
- Amber:<i> Put Curt back
on the phone! You're disgusting!</i>

523
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,900
<i> Is that a screwdriver?</i>

524
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,800
Smelly mommy did a smelly trick
with this last night.
- (Amber groans) - Let me show you.

525
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:34,600
- Curt: Don't listen to him!
- (door opens) Baby, don't listen to
him! Hang up the phone right now!

526
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:40,000
- Dylan: No, man, come on! - Curt:
Give me the phone! Dylan: Hang out with us!
Come here! Here, here, here.

527
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,400
Do a show for Amber, okay?
(laughs) Yeah.

528
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:47,100
- Curt: Amber! - Dylan: Suck him off.
- Woman: Fuck again is extra.
- Dylan: No problem.

529
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:53,300
Stop it! Amber! This is not me, and you know
that, okay? Amber:<i> I don't know anything
right now! I have no idea who you are!</i>

530
01:29:53,300 --> 01:30:01,200
This is all Dylan, I swear, all right?
I said stop it, you fucking whore!
- (beeping) - (Dylan laughing)

531
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:07,100
- Amber? Baby? - Dylan: Damn, dude!
Honey? Are you still there? Amber!

532
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,600
- Amber:<i> You have lost it!</i> - No, wait,
just listen to me! - Amber:<i> You are
fucking psycho right now!</i> - Listen to me!

533
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:15,500
Amber:<i> No, I'm hanging up! I'm done!</i> - No,
no! - Amber:<i> I am hanging up right now!</i>

534
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:21,000
But it was Dylan, all right? I should
have told you, okay? - But it was all
Dylan. - Amber:<i> You are so full of shit.</i>

535
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,300
Tell her it was all you!
Fucking tell her!

536
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:30,500

tell her you fucking brought the girls
back! - I didn't do anything! - (groaning)

537
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,000
Curt: Stop fucking around, man,
this is serious shit!

538
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:42,300

Bro, turn around! Dude! Fuck!
Screwdriver, dude! Turn around! Dude!

544
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,400
Dylan! Oh, I'm
going to fuck you up, bitch!

545
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,500
I'm gonna fuckin' stab that
screwdriver right in your

01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,100
I don't wanna be alone again.

655
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:17,900
Baby: I won't leave you,
Mama, I just need more room,
okay? - (cracking) - (sighs)

656
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,300
Baby: Don't worry,
I can fix this, Mama.

657
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,900
Just stay calm.

658
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,200
Baby: See, Mama?
Now there's room for both of us.

659
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,400
(banging)

660
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,700
(rattling)

661
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:08,300
(insects chirping)

662
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,900
(door creaking)

663
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:34,000
- Ti, is that you?
- Do I really look
that different?

664
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,900
- Where have you been?
- Don't start.

665
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,200
I waited as long as I could,
but it didn't sit right.

666
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I had to cut it out myself.

667
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,800
Then we'll just
have to try again.

668
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,700
I don't know if I can.

669
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:14,400
Of course you can.

670
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,700
(school bell rings)

671
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,100
♪ ( woman singing ) ♪

672
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,400
♪ ( woman singing ) ♪

673
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,500
(distorted screaming)

674
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,300
(distorted laughter)

675
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:10,100
I mean, how the fuck am I meant
to wank to that? (sighs)
