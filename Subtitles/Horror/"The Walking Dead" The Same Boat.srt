00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,763
They took the place down,

171
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,414
they got the guns,
they'll kill us, too.

172
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,999
<i>(Maggie, muffled)
Hey!</i>

173
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,201
I'm not going down like that,

174
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:10,919
not after making it this far.

175
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,604
(muffled)

176
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,890
- Maggie: <i>Hey!
- (Carol panting)</i>

177
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,728
What?

178
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,681
She's hyperventilating. Somebody
needs to take her gag off.

179
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,017
(hyperventilating)

180
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:33,024
She's a nervous
little bird, ain't she?

181
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:36,244
(inhales, panting)

182
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:37,862
(hammer clicks)

183
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,200
Look at you.

184
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:44,286
Bitch, how did you
make it this far?

185
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:49,207
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.

186
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:51,209
(panting)
I can't...

187
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,517
(panting continues)

188
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:05,924
Molly:
<i>Oh.</i>

189
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:09,494
You're one of those.

190
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,789
<i>(Carol wheezing)</i>

191
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,661
What are you so afraid of?

192
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,502
Are you actually afraid to die?

193
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,806
(scoffs)

194
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,294
All this and you're scared
of getting your ticket punched.

195
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,566
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

196
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,772
Just don't hurt Maggie.

197
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,707
Don't hurt the baby.

198
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Yeah, right.

199
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,208
Donnie: She got a bun in the
oven, she doesn't look it.

200
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,960
I'm only two months, I think.

201
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,130
You're some kind of stupid,

202
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,383
getting knocked up
at a time like this.

203
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,968
<i>You think that's funny?</i>

204
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,472
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

205
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,692
Women used to just die
in childbirth.

206
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,977
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

207
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:35,980
<i>Living through it,
why would you just give up?</i>

208
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,783
But are you gonna
live through it?

209
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:43,405
Anyway, that's cute.

210
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,907
Babies are the point.

211
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,259
Children are our future.

212
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,331
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.

213
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,219
The point is to stay standing.

214
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,504
<i>No.</i>

215
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:03,258
Walkers do that.

216
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,677
I'm choosing something.

217
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,514
That's right.

218
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,566
You are.

219
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,551
You did.

220
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,659
(Donnie groaning)

221
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:34,089
(coughing)

222
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,543
The baby.

223
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:43,598
(laughing)

224
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,888
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,

225
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,625
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

226
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,796
Molls.

227
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:06,037
Y'all are worse than a bunch

228
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,908
of evangelical second graders.

229
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,460
(coughing)

230
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:14,646
(hacking)

231
00:14:21,755 --> 00:14:24,756
Those things'll kill you.

232
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:26,925
They already have.

233
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:30,678
I'm a dead woman walking.

234
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,183
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.

235
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:38,486
(laughs, coughing)

236
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,323
(coughing continues)

237
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,229
Ah!
(groaning)

238
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,803
My arm feels like it's on fire.

239
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,622
You pull that off, you gonna
be nothing but a spigot.

240
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,974
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!

241
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,611
Scout crew is coming. They're
30 minutes out, maybe less.

242
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,231
Maggie:
<i>He doesn't have 30 minutes.</i>

243
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,983
His nerves are dying.

244
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,453
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

245
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:15,739
maybe his life.

246
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,992
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.

247
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,468
Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?

248
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,006
It's time to end this.

249
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:35,142
<i>Talk to Rick.</i>

250
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,930
30 minutes.

251
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,780
You know my problem?
(panting)

252
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,005
She did this to me.

253
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,790
She did it and she's just
sitting there

254
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,792
right as rain, fully intact.

255
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:12,212
- Paula:<i> Hey.</i>
- No, you're not gonna make the trade.

256
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:13,797
<i>And we just do 'em both now.</i>

257
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,235
Paula: <i>No, we wait
for the others.</i>

258
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:21,471
We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

259
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:22,806
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

260
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:25,108
(chuckles)
No.

261
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,112
You really gonna stick up for
some gutless bitch over me?

262
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,903
- God damn it!
- Paula:<i> Shut up.</i>

263
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:37,871
Donnie:
<i>Don't push me, Paula.</i>

264
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,257
<i>- (Donnie groans)</i>
- Paula:<i> Shut up!</i>

265
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,081
Leave her alone!

266
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,754
No! No!

267
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,505

268
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:57,758
You dumb, uppity bitch!

269

You really are
some kind of stupid.

272
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:20,414
Take her out.
See if she knows anything.

273
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,783
Should've done that before.

274
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,591
Move.

You got nice clothes,

278
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:53,647
time to make babies.

279
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,066
You're holed up somewhere good.

280
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,318
Tell me where.

281
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,570

Don't draw this out, bitch.

284
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,675
Just tell me where.

285
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:24,761
Help yourself
and the baby in your belly.

286
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:29,933
The way you stay alive
is you produce for us.

287
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:36,606
You're not the good guys.

288
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,027
You should know that.

289
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,881
Molly:
<i>He got you good, kid.</i>

290
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,867
He's in pain.

291
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:49,119
Guys can't handle pain.

- (Paula sighs)

293
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,796
Just wanted to say thank you

294
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,333
for helping Maggie,
for helping me.

295
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:07,804
My husband Ed,
he used to...

296
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:10,307
Yeah? I don't care
if your old man

297
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,476
used to ring your bell.

298
00:19:12,478 --> 00:19:16,980
I see exactly
who you are, Carol.

299
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,984
I know.

300
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,819
You're pathetic.

301
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,722
You wanna think
we're just the same?

302
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:26,957
Go ahead.

303
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,426
You're wrong.

304
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:32,729
He's just a warm body
for my bed.

305
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:36,433
That's it. I could
kill him in his sleep.

306
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,513
(chuckles)

307
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,684
Do you really believe
in that crap?

308
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,577
My faith got me through
the death of my daughter.

309
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,595
<i>Hmm.</i>

310
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:08,765
Well, the good news is maybe
you'll see her again soon.

Maggie:
<i>What happened?</i>

313
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:23,713
I stole something.
Got caught.

314
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,551
What?

315
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:30,787
<i>Gas, from this place.</i>

316
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,656
- Why?
- <i>To get a new car.</i>

317
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,825
Look for my boyfriend's body.

318
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,929
Did you find him?

319
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,498
<i>He was blown up.</i>

320
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,834
<i>Not much to find.</i>

<i>"Frankie."</i>

322
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,577
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

323
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,330
I barely knew him.

324
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,116
He was a dick.

325
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,623
Frank was my dad.

326
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,761
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.

327
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,820
- I'm sorry.
- No.

328
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,775
You aren't.

329
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,111
I'm not planning to die today.

330
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:31,164
Yeah, me neither.

331
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:36,119
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

332
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,293
Just tell me where.

00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,626
not getting much
in the way of a reward.

349
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:43,181
<i>- (static hissing)</i>
- Rick:<i> The other option won't work out for you.</i>

350
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:49,354
We'll take our chances.

351
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,148
(sighs) You don't
have to do this.

352
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,482
You don't have to fight.

353
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:04,819
Your people killed
all of my people.

354
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:06,154
Of course we gotta fight.

355
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:09,691
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

356
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,859
So tell me why.

357
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:17,715
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

358
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,834
tried to take everything we had.

359
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:26,090
They were gonna kill them.

360
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,893
Well, damn.

361
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:32,263
So now we know what
happened to T's group.

362
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,267
Those idiots.

363
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,353
Probably put on a big show.

364
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:42,774
Okay, fair play.

365
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:45,360
You were just
defending yourselves.

366
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:52,834
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?

367
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:56,087
<i>Blew them to pieces.</i>

368
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,289
<i>So, why not stop?</i>

369
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,713
They said they were
working for Negan.

370
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,717
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

371
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,938
He sounded like a maniac.

372
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,606
We were scared.
We had to stop him.

373
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:18,693
Sweetie, sweetie.

374
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,396
We are all Negan.

375
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:28,119
- What do you mean?
- <i>(Molly coughing)</i>

376
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:33,241

377
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:36,878

380
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:01,018
Well, look at you, little bird.

381
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,155
I didn't think you approved.

382
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,324
I don't.

383
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,553
(lighter clicks)

384
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,048
You are weak.

385
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:34,552
What are you so afraid of?

386
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,024
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.

387
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,364
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.

388
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:59,660
I was a secretary before.

389
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,217
I fetched coffee for my boss

390
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,053
and made him feel
good about himself.

391
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,339
I spent most of my days reading

392
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:13,925
stupid inspirational
e-mails

393
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:16,561
to try and feel good
about myself.

394
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:19,931
There was this one
that kept going around.

395
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:23,184
<i>A young woman
was having a hard time</i>

396
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,070
<i>and told her mom
she wanted to give up,</i>

397
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,905
so her mom went to the kitchen

398
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:31,325
and started boiling
three pots of water.

399
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,861
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

400
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:36,364
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

401
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,034
<i>After they had boiled
a while, her mom said,</i>

402
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:43,621
<i>"Look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.</i>

403
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:47,141
<i>The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.</i>

404
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:50,378
<i>The egg was fragile
and came out hard.</i>

405
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,465
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

406
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:00,888
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.

407
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,794
<i>See, to me, coffee
was just a thing</i>

408
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:08,563
<i>that my boss would drink up.</i>

409
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,631
<i>No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,</i>

410
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:13,434
<i>it was just never enough.</i>

411
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,741
<i>I was at work when
the Army took over DC.</i>

412
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,995
We weren't allowed to leave.

413
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:27,615
They had to evacuate all the
important people first...

414
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:31,502
members of Congress,
government employees.

415
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:34,422
So I was stuck with my boss.

416
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:36,841
Not my family...

417
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:41,646
my husband, my four girls...

418
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,853
(sniffles)

419
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,509
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

420
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,012
and he was going
to take me down, too.

421
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,865
He was the first person I killed

422
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,883
so that I could live.

423
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,455
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.

424
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,458
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.

425
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,679
I am not like you.

426
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:19,684
I'm still me, but better.

427
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:23,020
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.

428
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:24,889
You sure about that?

429
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,691
I'm alive.

430
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:29,143
With those people,
those killers.

431
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,145
<i>Your people are killers, Carol.</i>

432
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:34,198
That makes you a killer.

433
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:49,246
You... you're the one.

434
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:51,198
Excuse me?

435
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,884
You're the one
who's afraid to die.

436
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:56,671
And you're going to.

437
00:28:56,673 --> 00:29:00,174
You will die.

438
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,729
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

439
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,850
Are you going to kill me?

440
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,739
I hope not.

441
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:26,793

Rick on radio:
<i>I'm here.</i>

443
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,551
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

444
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,970
Rick:
<i>That's good.</i>

445
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:40,724
There's a large field with a
sign that says "God is dead"

446
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,011
about two miles
down I-66.

447
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:46,730
Good visibility
in all directions.

448
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:49,700
Rick: <i>We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?</i>

449
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:52,319
10 minutes.

450
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:59,493
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.

451
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:02,162
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

452
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,164
Paula: <i>No, there was no static.
There should've been static.</i>

453
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,216
<i>They're close.
They're probably already here.</i>

454
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,918
<i>We were careful,
but there were tracks.</i>

455
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,503
- <i>There had to be.</i>
- No...

456
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,338
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

457
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,723
They know what they're doing.

458
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,558
They're probably
waiting to kill us

459
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,059
as soon as we walk
out those doors.

460
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:18,345
- That's what we'd do.
- Carol: No.

461
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:24,101
You have to listen
to me, please.

462
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:26,937
Rick is a man of his word.

463
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,856
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.

464
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:33,026

as stupid as you are.

We have to be ready
to move at any second.

What about the girl?

476
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,986
Leave her for now.

477
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,806
If we leave, we travel light.

00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:52,388
- (blade rings)
- Go on, do it.

524
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,325
You've killed Donnie,
you've killed Molly.

525
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:59,395
<i>Your people have
destroyed my home.</i>

526
00:35:59,397 --> 00:36:01,280
- Get outta here.
- Carol.

527
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:02,898
Paula:
<i>You have no idea.</i>

528
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,319
The things I've done,

529
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:08,287
what I've given up,

530
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:11,324
<i>what I had to do.</i>

531
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:13,676
- Just run.
- Maggie:<i> Carol, shoot her.</i>

532
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:16,829
Go ahead. I've already
lost everything.

533
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,581
- (snarls)
- (gunshot)

534
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,017
(grunts)

535
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,419
'Chelle:
<i>Paula?</i>

<i>Paula?</i>

(grunting)

540
00:36:40,204 --> 00:36:42,655
You lying bitch!

541
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:45,174

<i>(Paula groans)</i>

544
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:02,758
I'll do it.

545
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:07,213
<i>(Paula laughs)</i>

546
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:10,132
You're good.

547
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,851
Nervous little bird.

548
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:16,022
You were her.

549
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:21,844
But not now, right?

550
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,314
Me, too.

551
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:30,319
I told you to run.

552
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:33,406
<i>If you could do all this,</i>

553
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:37,076
what were you
so afraid of, Carol?

554
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:52,241
I was afraid of this.

555
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:54,343
(laughs)

556
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,648

(screaming)

560
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,422
Man on radio: <i>Paula, we're
approaching the perimeter.</i>

561
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:25,074
<i>Are we a go?</i>

562
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:28,043

<i>(static hisses)</i>

566
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:48,948
(imitating Paula)
Meet us on the kill floor.

567
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:57,907
I think I might have
killed 18 people.

568
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,408
20.

569
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,747
I should've killed
Donnie, too, in the woods.

570
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:07,583
I had a clear shot.
I didn't miss.

571
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:14,006
None of this would've happened
if I had just killed him.

572
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:17,259
- Don't think about it.
- I can't stop.

573
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:21,096
We're almost done.

574
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,299
<i>(footsteps passing)</i>

575
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,832
Man: <i>Careful. The floor's slick.</i>

576
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,534
Man #2:
<i>You sure this is it?</i>

577
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,702
Man:
<i>She said kill floor.</i>

578
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:46,172
(lighter clicks)

579
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:48,324
Man #3:
<i>Hey, this one's locked.</i>

580
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:51,877
(rumbling)

581
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:55,047
What the hell?!
Agh!

582
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:57,049

(distorted growling)

585
00:41:08,372 --> 00:41:10,372
(echoes)
Maggie.

586
00:41:10,374 --> 00:41:11,757
You okay?

587
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:14,093
We got your trail.

588
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:16,762
- You start a fire?
- Yeah.

589
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:19,214
Hey, you good?

590
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:20,966
No.

591
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:22,718
Come here.

592
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:27,389
They're dead. They're all
dead, the ones that took us.

593
00:41:27,391 --> 00:41:29,224
They're all dead.

594
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:31,610
Hey, are you okay?

595
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,397
I just...

596
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:37,466
I can't anymore.

597
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:39,485
It's okay.

598
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,987
Your friends are dead.

599
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,740
No one's coming for ya.

600
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:46,241
So you might as well talk.

601
00:41:46,243 --> 00:41:49,328
Let him burn.

602
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,997
I'm gonna ask you
one last time...

603
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:54,833
how'd you get the bike?

604
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:56,752
- We found it.
- Daryl: Like hell you did.

605
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:57,920
We found it.

606
00:41:57,922 --> 00:41:59,672
Was Negan in
that building last night

607
00:41:59,674 --> 00:42:01,423
or was he here?

608
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:08,981
Both.

609
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,935
I'm Negan, shithead.

610
00:42:14,772 --> 00:42:17,439
There's a whole world of fun
that we can talk about,

611
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:18,640
so let's have a chat.

612
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:19,808
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.

613
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,444
(gunshot echoes)
