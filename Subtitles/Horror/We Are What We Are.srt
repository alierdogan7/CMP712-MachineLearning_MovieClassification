01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,401
Morning, Iris.

736
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,084
What are you doing
in my creek, Anders?

737
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,527
Wasting my time,
getting my feet wet.

738
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,768
I don't mind so much now
that you're around.

739
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,243
I can get you a pair
of my Daddy's socks.

740
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,560
You think so?

741
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,480
I know so.

742
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,046
Come on up.

743
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,605
So...

744
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,444
What are you looking for?

745
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,720
I, uh...

746
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,561
I probably shouldn't say.

747
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,369
- It's-- it's nothing.
- You can tell me.

748
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,680
Hell.

749
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,125
You were the first boy
I ever kissed.

750
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,085
Though you probably
don't remember that, do you?

751
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,041
No, no... I remember.

752
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,370
So...

753
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,429
You can tell me, what
are you looking for?

754
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,960
(sighing)

755
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,360
Well...

756
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,330
The storm, um,
just washed some...

757
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,682
things, uh, way down creek.

758
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,408
Well, what kind of things?

759
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,920
Bones.

760
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,845
Well, we've been finding
bones around here

761
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,968
since I was a little girl.

762
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,731
Deer and coons mostly.

763
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,837
No, but Doc Barrow thinks
that these are human.

764
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,251
You're just funnin' me.

765
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,728
No, I swear to God,
that's what he thinks.

766
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,131
But the sheriff,
he's not buying it, so...

767
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,686
So I don't know.

768
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,971
Let me get you those socks.

769
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,760
Hey-- hey, Iris?

770
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,123
Could I get a glass of water?

771
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,845

What you doing here, Anders?

776
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,960
Is something wrong?

777
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,446
No.

778
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,523
No, I just got my socks wet.

779
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,604
Iris is getting me a dry
pair from upstairs.

780
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,326
What is that?

781
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,128
Oh, looks like some sort of
old tooth or something.

782
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,089
I found it out in the creek.

783
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,525
Thanks.

784
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,127
So... how old
are you now, Rose?

785
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,440
- 14.
- 14?

786
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,609
You're growing up.

787
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,120
It happens.

788
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,925
Yes, it does.

What's this?

793
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,842
Some kind of bone,
I found it out back.

794
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,524
My daddy would know.

795
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,931
He's good with bones.

796
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,640

Not far,

804
