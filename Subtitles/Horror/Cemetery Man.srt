1
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,518
- Hello?
- It's me.

2
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,312
Oh, am I bothering you, Francesco?

3
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,607
No, don't worry, I had to get
out of the shower some time.

4
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,401
Hold on a minute, Franco...

5
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,673
You were saying, Franco?

6
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,260
No, no, nothing. Just
calling to see how you doing.

7
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,429
You know how things are...

8
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,685
...life goes on.

9
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,052
Gnaghi!

10
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,459
I've been shouting at
you for hours. Gnaghi!

11
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,394
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.

12
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,272
- 12th row, 3rd grave, right?
- Gna.

13
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,037
Grave three.

14
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,040
Here we go.

15
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,668
I know you've heard this before,

16
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,127
but this time,

17
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,213
my dear Ghigini,

18
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,548
it is forever.

19
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,218
Rest in peace!

20
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,514
Oh, my back...

21
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,233
What a waste of good marble.

22
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,776
Never looks right when you fix it.

23
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,861
All this fancy packaging.

24
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,614
I don' know why they don't
just cover the graves with dirt.

25
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,459
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!

26
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,920
- Ea...t!
- Gnaghi,

27
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,214
give me the spade! Gnaghi!

28
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,008
give me the fucking spade!

29
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,438
There we go.

30
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,194
You handle the rest Gnaghi.

31
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,072
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.

32
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,616
Weird name, isn't it?

33
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,159
Francis Of Death.

34
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,661
Saint Francis Of Death.

35
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,039
I often thought of having it changed.

36
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,125
Andrea Dellamorte would
be nicer, for example.

37
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,170
I'm the watchman of
the Buffalora cemetery,

38
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,714
I don't know how the epidemic started,

39
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,343
All I know is that some people,
on the 7th night after their death

40
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,261
come back to life.

41
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
I call them "Returners",

42
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,601
but frankly I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

43
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,187
The only way to get rid
of them once and for all,

44
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,064
is to split their heads open.

45
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,484
A spade'll do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.

46
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,653
Come and have a glass of wine.

47
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,701
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,

48
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,746
or is Buffalora just an exception?

49
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,542
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?

50
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,419
I'm just doing my job.

51
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,556
Good morning engineer.
How are you doing today?

52
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,849
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?

53
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,851
The cemetery is open, isn't it?

54
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,937
For you, any time.

55
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,483
Hello cutie. Here...

56
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,819
How are you?

57
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,281
He's happy. He likes
it when the sun shines.

58
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,289
I'm not an engineer...

59
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,835
...and you are no cutie.

60
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,263
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:

61
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,391
"Distinctive physical marks: all".

62
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,937
He has a real passion for dead leaves,

63
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,898
can't stand it when the
wind blows them away...

64
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,901
Oh well,

65
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,363
we all do what we can
not to think about life.

66
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,525
The most beautiful living
woman I have ever seen!

67
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,029
Will I see her again?

68
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,478
I just came to water the flowers
on your poor father's grave.

69
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,774
Husband.

70
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,072
How long has he been dead?

71
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,243
Two weeks.

72
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,203
- Thank goodness.
- What?

73
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,082
- I mean, I'm very sorry.
- Have you no respect for pain?

74
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,750
Well, you know how these
things are... You see:

75
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,504
- in time, pain heals.
- It's not healing a bit.

76
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,219
He was wonderful,

77
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,723
he was a wonderful lover, incredible,

78
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,683
tireless.

79
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,895
He was fantastic!

80
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,426
I messed it all up,

81
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,094
I've lost her.

82
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,264
Will I see her again?

83
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,400
Hey, Franco!

84
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,574
Franco is the only living person

85
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,410
who even calls me. Now and
then I stop by his office

86
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,913
to remind myself what he looks like.

87
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,290
You can't live on memories alone.

88
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,423
It's for you. Sign as usual.

89
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,846
- Have you got a pen?
- No.

90
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,932
Hold on a sec, here we are.

91
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,064
Have you had any visits last nights?

92
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,732
A couple, yes.

93
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,655
All this extra work! It's
much if the pay me any more.

94
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,490
Tell the Mayor...

95
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,993
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.

96
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,954
Good-bye job and
good-bye house!

97
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,373
Come on, who do you
think would believe you?

98
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,416
Listen, I don't care if
you don't believe me Franco,

99
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,293
you're not the one who pays me!

100
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,753
I believe you,

101
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,005
I believe you, and you're right...

102
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,007
- At least have him pay the overtime.
- Good.

103
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,592
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!

104
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,219
It's not that easy.

105
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,139
First you have to fill out an M3 form,

106
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,058
report with an M3 form...

107
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,685
Forms...

108
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,729
I could speed things up there for you...

109
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,023
It's easier just to shoot them.

110
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,820
One M3 form!

111
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,531
Going to get our willies wet tonight?

112
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,491
Some of us, yeah.

113
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,413
Hell, at a certain point
in life, you realize

114
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,915
you know more dead people than living.

115
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,365
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

116
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,784
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.

117
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,454
You know, this is the
only job I could get

118
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:53,040
even with a degree in biology.

119
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,836
Anyway we all end up here
sooner or later, don't we?

120
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,548
I've got a great little
house... Want to see it?

121
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,761
I don't live alone, I've
got a helper, Gnaghi.

122
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,055
He's a real conversationist!

123
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,644
The cemetery's small, but
it's got a marvellous ossuary!

124
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,108
An ossuary...

125
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,791
I have never seen anything so...

126
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,751
exciting!

127
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,086
Neither have I.

128
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,620
It's like in my dreams!

129
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,789
This is my dream.

130
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,127
I couldn't ask for anything more.

131
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,044
Me neither.

132
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:30,179
You know, you've got
a real nice ossuary.

133
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,972
Thanks.

134
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,476
You will allow me to return, won't you?

135
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,439
You will allow me to kiss
you just once, won't you?

136
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:41,899
No.

137
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,984
Not like this.

138
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,826
Like this.

139
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:24,107
I must be faithful to
the memory of my husband!

140
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,654
I can't. I can't!

141
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:32,658
It's not my fault... It's this place.

142
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,454
I feel strange tremors.

143
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,997
It's not the cold...

144
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,248
I'm not afraid...

145
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:44,044
This place wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

146
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:47,172
I don't want to!

147
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,134
I don't want to!

148
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,598
I can't! I can't!

149
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,141
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.

150
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,604
Why here?

151
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:52,732
Why on your poor husband's grave?

152
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,443
I've never kept anything from him...

153
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,113
We trusted each other implicitly.

154
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,116
He would have liked to know.

155
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,954
Well, if that's the case...

156
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,548
All these lights!

157
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,299
Let them watch.

158
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:21,886
What's better than watching
two lovers making love, hey?

159
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,267
Just to have a bit of privacy.

160
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,698
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.

161
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,292
It's never been like
this before, with anybody.

162
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,877
Only you.

163
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:20,296
No one will ever make us part.

164
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,262
Gnaghi! The gun!

165
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,014
I can explain! Listen to me,

166
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,934
you've always been so understanding!

167
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:35,061
That's life!

168
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,376
It's nothing my love,

169
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,919
you're fine.

170
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,548
Great,

171
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:05,299
just when I don't need it anymore.

172
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,178
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!

173
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,849
Go on, get the doctor!

174
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,476
Go on! Move!

175
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,895
Nothing can separate us.

176
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,314
I swear, nothing.

177
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:30,783
Nothing will separate us, will it?

178
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,786
Nothing, my love. Nothing.

179
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:39,917
Not even death?

180
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:41,961
Not even death.

181
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:23,294
Dellamorte, are you
in there? Dellamorte!

182
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,643
Jesus! You scared me to death!

183
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,561
Were you looking for
me, Chief Straniero?

184
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,189
Yes, Dr. Vercesi called.
What happened last night?

185
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,525
Well you know. Why are
you asking me? She's dead.

186
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:46,776
I know she's dead,

187
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,486
but how did that happen?

188
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,072
Her husband.

189
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:54,075
Sure! He came back from
the dead, he raped her,

190
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,785
then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?

191
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,453
No, he didn't rape her.

192
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,039
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!

193
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,124
Dr. Vercesi, are you spying on us?

194
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,001
No, I dropped this certificate.

195
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,129
Her heart stopped from fear, it
wasn't the bite that killed her.

196
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:11,217
She died while making...
well you know... doing it.

197
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,011
You know what that means, my boy?

198
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,555
I'll have to look somewhere else
for the creep who killed her!

199
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,058
- You are no longer a suspect.
- Why not?

200
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,852
Well, you know what I mean.

201
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:23,896
Look, don't make me say it!

202
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,024
Go on, you can say it. I
don't mind, I'm impotent!

203
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:30,278
Don't use that word! A young
man like you, at your age...

204
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:31,237
Did she have any relatives?

205
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:33,698
No, no relatives, no friends.

206
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,910
Well, I have to say that...

207
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,037
Shit! This is definitely not my style!

208
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,419
- Can I keep her here?
- If you pay for the funeral, of course

209
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:48,212
you can do whatever
the hell you want with her.

210
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,631
- Does that wrap it up, then?
- Yeah, except for a killer on the loose.

211
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,717
Care to join me for a cup of tea?

212
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,637
The weather's changing at last!

213
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:19,076
I can't forgive myself
for having lied to you:

214
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,496
I don't have a degree in biology,

215
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,624
I didn't even finish high school.

216
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:32,840
I haven't read more than
two books in my whole life:

217
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:35,843
one,

218
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:38,596
never finished,

219
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,933
and the other is the phone book.

220
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,372
I don't want her to become a Returner.

221
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't want to see her again.

222
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:35,820
No!

223
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:37,988
Yes, my love!

224
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:40,699
No, don't make me do it!

225
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:43,118
But if you do it so well... so well!

226
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:45,955
Not to you!

227
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,749
It will be better with
me than with the others!

228
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:38,173
Gna!

229
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,891
You do it!

230
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:53,272
Well go on! If you finish
fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.

231
00:28:53,397 --> 00:28:54,440
Gna!

232
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:06,118
- Here comes the Unforgiven.
- Who?

233
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,995
The Tombstone Mayor.

234
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:12,374
The man whose dick's so
small he pees with tweezers.

235
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:17,463
He could become a
woman. That'd solve it!

236
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,591
They are sewing them
back on in the States now.

237
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:23,093
Yeah, they can stitch it right on,
if you've got one to start with.

238
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,095
Forget it, I started that rumour.

239
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:27,181
The more they laugh, the
further away they seem.

240
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,600
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.

241
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:32,728
Maybe you can.

242
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:34,605
Engineer!

243
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:39,693
Engineer, engineer, come! Have a seat!

244
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,946
Well well well, what a surprise!

245
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:46,784
Yes! It's a miracle
seeing you here, engineer!

246
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:49,536
It's a miracle seeing
you here, Mr. Mayor.

247
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:54,083
So, how are things down at
our cemetery? How are things?

248
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,876
Well how do you think things are?

249
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,127
Population's shrinking.

250
00:29:57,336 --> 00:30:00,255
You're lucky, my dear engineer!

251
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:03,675
You just can't imagine how
things are at the Town Hall.

252
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,594
Now that the elections are upon us,

253
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,222
it is chaos, right, inspector?

254
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,517
Yeah, it's a thrill for all,
nobody wants to lose their job.

255
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,393
I was hoping for a New Deal...

256
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:15,687
Daddy, what's this?

257
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:18,357
This is my assistant Gnaghi.

258
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,280
He's sweet!

259
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:27,199
Will you buy him, daddy?

260
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:31,995
That's great, it even knows how to cry!

261
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:33,831
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.

262
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,791
Could you move over, darling?

263
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,751
Would you tell your
daughter to move over please?

264
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:38,836
Yes of course.

265
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:40,671
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excited...

266
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:43,006
Oh, I'm sure he's
charming. Now, where was I?

267
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:51,598
What's he doing? Dancing?

268
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,184
No, no, he's just about to...

269
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,773
What the hell are you doing Valentina?

270
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,025
He threw up on me, Claudio!

271
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:03,443
Oh, a new fact!

272
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,445
Would you like to go for a ride?

273
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,115
I knew you'd understand!

274
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:10,284
Take off!

275
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:17,708
By the way, one of these days

276
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,876
I have to talk to you
about the cemetery.

277
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:25,382
The youth of today...
They're so... emotional.

278
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,434
Come on, Gnaghi! Get in, for God's sake!

279
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,811
Don't do this, just get in the car!

280
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,939
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!

281
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:43,525
She understood it was just a
demonstration of your affection.

282
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:47,446
Anyway, it's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it?

283
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,618
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!

284
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:57,289
Look, first love doesn't count.

285
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:59,499
It's last love that counts!

286
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:10,010
Nobody came today.

287
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,970
I was a bit bored,

288
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,557
not even the admiral...
he's just disappeared!

289
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:18,477
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?

290
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,021
Yeah, come again and stay a while.

291
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:25,650
Oh, he was such a
distinguished man, the admiral!

292
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:29,154
Always used to bring me, always,

293
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:32,324
a touch of Sambuca.

294
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,359
Oh, come on Gnaghi!

295
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,402
You'll get over, you'll see!

296
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,324
Time passes,

297
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:16,034
nothing seems the same...

298
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:21,998
It just gets worse.

299
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:25,210
God, is it ever difficult
trying to make you feel better!

300
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:31,383
What were you doing with the Mayor's
daughter anyway? She's only a child!

301
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,343
Gna!

302
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:39,099
Oh yeah, that's not true,
you are not a child, Gnaghi.

303
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:42,561
You're a year older than I am. Anyway...

304
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,272
One day,

305
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,232
you'll settle down with some...

306
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:49,818
poor creature like yourself.

307
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,323
In the meanwhile, why do you care?

308
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:58,410
They all end up here
sooner or later, Gnaghi.

309
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:01,329
Often sooner than later.

310
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:05,375
Faster, open it up!

311
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:09,880
- If daddy could see us now!
- He'd kill me!

312
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:13,633
Claudio!

313
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:15,677
- Off we go!
- Go!

314
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,475
Go! Go!

315
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:24,686
Go!

316
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,364
- Hang on!
- Eat our dust!

317
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:55,008
Four motorcycles racing...

318
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:56,676
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.

319
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:58,678
Her head was sliced right off.

320
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:00,430
They had to sew it back on the body.

321
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:03,683
The bikes crashed into
a bus loaded with scouts

322
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:06,811
on their way back from
a church-sponsored rally.

323
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:08,772
Slaughter of the innocents!

324
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:10,774
And they were all so young.

325
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:14,944
They felt their life was ahead of them,
but in fact they were already passing by.

326
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,905
Well, you've got your hands full!

327
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,782
Oh, more than you know!

328
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:21,826
Gnaghi, we're going to
need a lot of bullets.

329
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:30,043
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

330
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:33,672
# never should have, never
should have gone just then.

331
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:37,133
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

332
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:41,137
# Never should have, now
I'll never go again! #

333
00:35:41,346 --> 00:35:43,014
Claudio! Take me with you!

334
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,892
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!

335
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:47,852
Take me with you, my love!

336
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,271
Nasty tart!

337
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:53,066
My son wasn't with you!

338
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,318
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!

339
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,987
- But he loved me!
- Liar!

340
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:00,698
He was mine, he loved me!

341
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:04,077
- Only me!
- Have you no respect for a mother's pain?

342
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,538
We're born to die,

343
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:09,165
born merely to die.

344
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:11,000
Do you remember?

345
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:12,627
Just yesterday,

346
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:15,171
she was alive, happy.

347
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,173
Do you remember?

348
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:20,093
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her,

349
00:36:20,385 --> 00:36:22,262
and she took it so well!

350
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:25,557
And now, she's gone...

351
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:28,518
and right on the eve of the elections!

352
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:31,062
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.

353
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:35,108
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?

354
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:09,017
Is it true as they say, that the
dead come back to life here at night?

355
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:10,435
Tell me the truth!

356
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:11,728
Hey! Who told you that?

357
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,898
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?

358
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,399
What if it is?

359
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,110
I've got to see Claudio again!

360
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:21,613
I have to know whether
he loved me or her!

361
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,698
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

362
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,409
No, wait...

363
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:29,245
Go away! I haven't got
time for the living!

364
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,411
Gnaghi?

365
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,833
Gnaghi!

366
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,336
Gnaghi, they came back
sooner than we thought!

367
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,089
Gnaghi wake up!

368
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,068
Gnaghi, watch out!

369
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:28,966
Gnaghi,

370
00:40:29,425 --> 00:40:32,637
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

371
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:44,440
Well, that's it, time's up and

372
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:47,902
I want you upstairs and
ready in five minutes! Okay?

373
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:02,727
Oh no, what's she doing here?

374
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:17,241
Visiting hours are over!

375
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,660
No one is going to
take me away from him!

376
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:24,790
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!

377
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,793
No, Claudio!

378
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:13,297
Claudio, take me with
you! Don't leave me!

379
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:15,841
Stupid cow!

380
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,055
Come on!

381
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,270
Wait! Wait!

382
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:34,860
Claudio please, take me with you!

383
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,863
Tell me you only love me!

384
00:43:39,114 --> 00:43:40,616
Please...

385
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:58,300
Claudio!

386
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:03,055
You only love me, right?

387
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:31,959
Damn! It always shoots to
the right when it's cold.

388
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:55,566
Gnaghi!

389
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,192
No, please don't! He's only eating me!

390
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:39,693
Move aside.

391
00:45:40,152 --> 00:45:43,363
Mind your business! I shall
be eaten by whoever I please!

392
00:45:43,572 --> 00:45:46,200
This is my business. They pay me for it.

393
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,256
The living dead

394
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:04,510
and the dying living are all the same.

395
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:07,137
Cut from the same cloth.

396
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:10,933
But disposing of dead
people is a public service,

397
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:13,435
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble

398
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:16,688
if you kill someone
while they're still alive.

399
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:28,450
Wait!

400
00:46:46,093 --> 00:46:48,178
This way they'll be together forever.

401
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:57,145
I'm sentimental.

402
00:47:17,874 --> 00:47:19,584
Patience, Gnaghi.

403
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:22,170
In love, it's the waiting
that's the best part.

404
00:47:23,755 --> 00:47:25,841
You have to learn how to wait.

405
00:48:44,836 --> 00:48:47,464
- What's your name again?
- Gna!

406
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:49,382
Gnaghi.

407
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:56,431
I'm Valentina.

408
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:59,559
Haven't I seen you before?

409
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:04,147
Oh yeah. Now I remember.

410
00:49:04,356 --> 00:49:06,650
You threw up on me. How sweet!

411
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,285
But I like shy boys.

412
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:20,330
And you never say no to a kiss.

413
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:21,581
Take advantage.

414
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:25,460
I'm certainly in no position
to refuse. Besides,

415
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:27,420
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.

416
00:50:40,952 --> 00:50:42,412
False alarm!

417
00:50:43,663 --> 00:50:45,457
It was only a cat.

418
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,926
No use you trying
to help me, little thing!

419
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:59,846
If I can't do it, imagine you...

420
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:02,974
Putting this skull together,

421
00:51:03,683 --> 00:51:06,478
is one of the most difficult
things in the world.

422
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:43,848
You know, you really are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.
