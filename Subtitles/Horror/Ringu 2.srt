6
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,800
- The corpse found in the well...
- Yes, sir.

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,833
Mr Yamamura.

8
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,039
No, it's not necessary.

9
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,152
I haven't seen her
since she was a child, anyway.

10
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,271
The well was on the estate of
Dr Heihachiro lkuma.

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,198
The place was sold 30 years ago.

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,119
Since then no one
has opened the well.

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,550
It has been sealed.

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,591
Then there's no doubt.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,518
It's Sadako.

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,149
But...

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,353
No 'Sadako' is registered in either
Dr lkuma's or her mother's records.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,151
What's happened to Dr lkuma?

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,918
He died, soon after
the place was sold.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,797
So I'm the only one left alive.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,197
Please cremate her immediately.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,198
It doesn't matter
which family she belongs to.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,750
I'm afraid we can't do that.

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,353
This is a very strange case.

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,271
One of the people who found
her body is dead.

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,630
The other one is missing.

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,159
There's something else.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,553
The estimated time of her death...

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,799
According to the autopsy,
she died only one or two years ago.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,949
What?

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,999
It means she was alive.

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,077
In the well, all that time,

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,599
for 30 years.

43
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,792
There's a story going around
about a cursed video.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,638
What kind of video it is?

45
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,477
The version I've heard is,

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,399
a scary woman appears,

47
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
saying, "You'll die in one week."

48
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,634
That's what I've heard.

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,271
It interrupts late-night TV.

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,994
Then there's a telephone call.

51
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,114
The late-night programme
on which channel?

52
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,992
What I've heard is

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,111
some local channel in Izu.

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,878
- In Izu?
- Yes.

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,039
Is it really a good idea
to use this stuff?

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,593
Why not?

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,876
You'll die unless you make a copy
and show it to others...

58
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,195
Yes.

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,119
I have to confirm that story
with someone.

60
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,996
Have you heard from Ms Asakawa?

61
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,315
No.

62
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,550
The police called about her, too.

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,829
Yeah?

64
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,388
Excuse me...

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,237
Can I see Ms Reiko Asakawa?

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,793
Well...

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,399
She's not in at the moment.

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,278
There's a story going around

69
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,789
about a cursed video.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,479
What kind of video it is?

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,318
The version I've heard is,

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,273
a scary woman appears,

73
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,074
saying 'You'll die in one week. "

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,759
That's what I've heard.

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,359
It interrupts late-night TV.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,788
Wait!

77
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,796
Do you know anything about Asakawa?

78
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,231
We haven't been able to contact her.

79
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,040
A man named Ryuji T akayama is dead.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,274
T akayama?

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,519
Ms Asakawa's ex.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,035
The police came once.

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,356
She's been away for a while.

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,471
Did they go inside?

85
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,635
No, not at the time.

86
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,039
Go ahead.

87
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,473
Ms Takano.

88
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,513
What is this?

89
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,512
A video tape?

90
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,634
Dad,

91
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,239
forgive me.

92
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,590
This is to save Yoichi...

93
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,308
Are you OK?

94
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,148
Last time I saw her,

95
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,318
Ms Asakawa asked me about the video.

96
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,432
It was a human interest story.

97
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,108
They don't give a single mother
important reports.

98
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,876
Oh, yes, her boy.

99
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,473
I'll go ask the school.

100
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,159
Ms Asakawa?

101
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,112
She's not in.

102
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,072
This is the police.

103
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,875
Reiko Asakawa's father was
found dead this morning.

104
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,236
- Mr Kadokura?
- This way.

105
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,550
- Sir.
- Yes?

106
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,553
- I'm Omuta, from Shizuoka police.
- Thanks for coming.

107
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
Any luck finding the daughter?

108
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,158
None at all.

109
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,828
How about the body found in the well?

110
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,156
- We're rebuilding her face.
- Rebuild...

111
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,032
As soon as we have her model,

112
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,754
we'll take it
and ask around the area.

113
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,869
He found the body first.

114
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,471
Do you want to see it?

115
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
People don't normally die like this.

116
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,752
Was he making a copy?

117
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,108
Well...

118
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,278
We wonder if it has anything to do
with this note.

119
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,271
DEAR RElKO,
I GOT RlD OF THE VlDEO.

120
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,277
THERE lS NOTHlNG
TO WORRY ABOUT.

121
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,509
No good.

122
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,280
He's been absent
for more than 10 days.

123
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,152
What's wrong?

124
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,634
Nothing.

125
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,917
Why are you looking for Ms Asakawa?

126
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,954
I want to know what happened
to Dr Takayama.

127
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,711
I'll check a bit more.

128
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,831
If I find anything, I'll call you.

129
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,319
See you.

130
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,275
Yes?

131
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,313
Police. Sorry for calling so late.

132
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,636
I'd like to ask
about Mr Ryuji Takayama.

133
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
Are you Mai T akano,
who found his body?

134
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,955
Yes.

135
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,752
May l...

136
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,877
Please.

137
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,429
Oh, I remember Mr T akayama.

138
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,631
He taught maths.

139
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,319
Are you...

140
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,351
I'm his assistant.

141
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,754
I see.

142
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,070
Ms Takano,

143
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,429
have you ever heard of
Sadako Yamamura?

144
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,995
No.

145
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,192
Shizuko Yamamura? Sadako's mother?

146
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,910
No.

147
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,236
Heihachiro lkuma?

148
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,759
No.

149
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,997
Ryuji Takayama and Reiko Asakawa
were investigating something.

150
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,553
Is that right?

151
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,709
I don't know.

152
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,150
I see.

153
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,428
Today,

154
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,871
Reiko Asakawa's father
was found dead.

155
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,315
He died the same way
as Mr Takayama.

156
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,909
You know what I mean?

157
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,670
Please go.

158
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,996
They found the body in the well.

159
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,352
An unidentified woman, who died
one or two years ago.

160
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,915
But the well has been sealed
with concrete

161
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,111
for 30 years.

162
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,276
Can you believe it?

163
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,313
In the dark well, for 30 years.

164
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,633
Neither of her hands had nails.

165
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,149
They were all found in
the sides of the well.

166
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,635
Probably, she tried to climb out
so many times...

167
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,398
Please go!

168
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,958
Alright.

169
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,079
If you find out anything about
Reiko Asakawa,

170
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,472
call me at this number.

171
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,519
I'm sorry,

172
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,280
but this is such a strange case.

173
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,198
What's it all about, the video?

174
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,355
I don't know.

175
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,758
No...

176
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,758
Do you live around here?

177
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,669
I can concentrate better here
than in my room.

178
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,472
I see.

179
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,509
OK, it's rolling.

180
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,518
Let's continue.
Three seconds...

181
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,991
So, you have to copy it

182
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,714
and show it to someone else
within a week.

183
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,878
Otherwise, a week later,
at the same time...

184
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,231
So there's an original video
to make a copy from?

185
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,510
Yes.

186
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,473
Where does it come from?

187
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,911
I've heard that it's just there
in the room.

188
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,396
Everybody has some videos
they can't remember recording.

189
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,034
Among those tapes,
they find a strange one.

190
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,312
- How would you know that's the one?
- It's obvious if you see it.

191
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,909
- Has anyone seen it?
- I know someone who has it.

192
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,160
They're scared,
so show it to each other.

193
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,078
It's going around among friends.

194
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,871
Have you seen it?

195
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,632
Is it possible to get me a copy?

196
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,795
OK.

197
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,275
Excuse me.

198
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,514
Work out a price.

199
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,311
Probably, Ms Asakawa was
after these four.

200
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,511
A week after this date,

201
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,029
all of them died at the same time.

202
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,679
Hard to believe, isn't it?

203
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,999
This girl, Tomoko,

204
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,758
she was Ms Asakawa's niece.

205
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,318
A girl was with her
when she died.

206
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,708
Kurahashi...

207
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,432
Masami Kurahashi.

208
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,710
What happened to her?

209
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,074
She's in the hospital.

210
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,759
She can't speak.

211
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,790
The hospital belongs
to your university.

212
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,278
The doctor can't tell you anything
about patients' privacy.

213
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,438
The questions should be
on the area of his research.

214
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,914
Fine.

215
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,552
This way, please.

216
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,633
Ms Kurahashi!

217
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,512
How are you feeling?

218
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,349
Would you like to come out
to the balcony for a change?

219
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,191
Doctor wants you to
get some fresh air.

220
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,550
Are you still afraid of TV?

221
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,559
It's fine.

222
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,149
I'll bring a screen
so that you won't see it.

223
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,675
OK?

224
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,870
Doctor,

225
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,792
they're here.

226
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,389
Hello.

227
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,919
I'm Kawajiri.

228
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,155
Please.

229
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,034
Our medical files are

230
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,635
different from others,
because we attach photos.

231
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,632
Do you know why?

232
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,910
In case they run away?

233
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,554
That's right.

234
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,557
Illness can change the patient, even
their family can't recognise them.

235
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,354
So we always take photos
when they arrive.

236
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,711
But when we took photos
of this patient...

237
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,114
..with our usual camera here...

238
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,920
..a strange image came up.

239
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,111
It's called 'spirit photography'.

240
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,510
Something in a person's mind affects
the light and exposure.

241
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,756
There were similar cases in the past.

242
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,076
You mean, this photo was...

243
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,468
We also tried just
having her hold a film.

244
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,438
This shows a character clearly.

245
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,752
SADA

246
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,954
You may think I'm a strange doctor.

247
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,072
All of my colleagues do.

248
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,631
Do you know Ryuji Takayama?

249
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,434
That's odd.

250
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,756
He's the only one
who listened to me.

251
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,430
He was once in medical school,
before he went in for maths.

252
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,718
You know he died?

253
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,317
What a shame.

254
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,550
You didn't even come to his funeral.

255
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,471
OK? This way,
you don't have to see it.

256
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,191
No need to rush.

257
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,592
Nice and slow.

258
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,595
Take your time...

259
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,234
What's wrong?

260
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,389
Are you feeling bad?

261
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,757
Ms Kurahashi...

262
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,918
Take her to the treatment room.

263
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,518
Tomoko...

264
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,029
Tomoko...

265
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,352
Help...

266
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,831
Help me...

267
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,393
Help her to get up!

268
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,749
Are you OK?

269
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,235
Help me!

270
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,556
They said it was the first time
she's spoken.

271
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,398
Are you going to continue
Ms Asakawa's report?

272
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,238
Yes.

273
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,158
You'd better stop.

274
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,314
Why?

275
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,552
Just stop it.

276
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,036
Did the patient tell you something?

277
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,229
Wait.

278
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,913
Excuse me.

279
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,356
You'd better not
tell anybody about it.

280
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,752
Such power you've got...

281
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,358
..it's no use to anyone.

282
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,638
Yoichi!

283
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,876
Are you Yoichi?

284
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,072
Where do you live?

285
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,674
You can't talk...

286
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,151
Go in there.

287
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,317
It's bare, isn't it?

288
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,158
Please.

289
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,311
I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.
I'M HUNGRY.

290
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,475
WHERE WERE YOU?

291
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,159
So, you need to talk?

292
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,909
Do you remember a girl called Masami?

293
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,000
She was with Tomoko when she died.

294
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,309
Yes.

295
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,270
When she went near the TV
in the hospital...

296
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,709
..a strange image came on.

297
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,272
What was it?

298
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,119
A well.

299
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,512
Only for an instant, though.

300
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,319
Was that all?

301
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,435
Yes.

302
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,952
You've seen it, haven't you?

303
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,195
It's fine,
if that's all you've watched.

304
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,235
But don't watch it again.

305
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,473
Masami...

306
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,911
She couldn't speak either.

307
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,792
What are you trying to say?

308
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,478
If Yoichi goes on like this...

309
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,193
What can we do, then?

310
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,277
Lock him up in the hospital?

311
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,516
It's none of your business.

312
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,636
I'm sorry.

313
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,878
Please go.

314
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,595
Can I come back again sometime
to see Yoichi?

315
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,711
...they can't remember recording.

316
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,196
Among those tapes,
they find a strange one.

317
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,799
How would you know...

318
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,433
Oh, hi.

319
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,553
This...

320
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,588
Oh...

321
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,631
So you got it.

322
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,319
20,000 yen, was it?

323
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,798
I...

324
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,230
..I watched it last night.

325
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,395
What?

326
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,549
Mr Okazaki...
you'll watch it, won't you?

327
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,913
Of course I will.

328
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,951
There's no point if I don't.

329
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,352
Will you promise?

330
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,749
Of course I will.

331
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,995
Trust me.

332
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,075
Hey,

333
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,349
the money.

334
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,353
Please keep the promise.

335
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,478
Nice catch.

336
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,277
Here it comes.

337
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,355
Here...

338
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,833
Oh...

339
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,235
you're learning that already.

340
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,749
Hey,

341
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,630
why were you
at the station the other day?

342
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,115
Was your mum angry?

343
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,312
Is anyone?

344
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,795
THE WOMAN WlTH LONG HAlR.

345
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,319
Dinner's ready.

346
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,272
Go and wash your hands.

347
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,915
I thought he won't speak

348
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,680
because he's blaming me.

349
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,359
Deep down in his mind.

350
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,479
That's not true.

351
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,352
When we came back
from my dad's,

352
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,155
the TV switched on automatically,
as Yoichi went near.

353
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,113
Could you talk to Dr Kawajiri
about it?

354
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,112
If Yoichi is...

355
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,197
really...

356
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,870
You've met Reiko Asakawa.

357
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,397
I didn't call him.

358
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,070
Okazaki, the assistant director,
told me about the patient.

359
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,157
He should be here any minute.

360
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,713
So...

361
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,556
We're going to try an experiment.

362
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,638
It may help the boy as well.

363
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,755
Come in.

364
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,033
This way.

365
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,552
What are you trying to do?

366
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,830
It's normal tap water.

367
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,559
The paper absorbs...

368
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,998
..well, about that much.

369
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,959
Do the same as before.

370
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,559
Concentrate on the water.

371
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,235
That's enough.

372
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,591
The water's changed.

373
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,550
Some kind of energy was transferred
from her to the water.

374
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,354
It also explains the film exposure.

375
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,596
It's all about energy transfer.

376
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,429
Eventually all the energy should be
transferred from her.

377
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,478
The experiment is to prove it.

378
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,629
Please.

379
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,550
- Are you trying to video it?
- Yes. You've seen it, right?

380
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,909
Don't do that!

381
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,792
- That image of a well...
- A well?

382
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,513
Everyone who sees it dies!

383
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,913
But you look perfectly fine.

384
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,553
Get ready.

385
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,239
Oh, Okazaki!

386
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,634
This is a brand new tape.

387
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,637
Could you set it up for me?

388
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,432
Masami...

389
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,949
this experiment is dangerous.

390
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,913
If people see it...

391
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,990
There's something in my head...

392
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,549
Set the tape, quick!

393
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,312
Even if there is such a video,
videos don't kill people.

394
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,475
Fear kills.

395
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,399
If I can prove this,
we can eliminate the energy of fear.

396
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,158
Free the fear.

397
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,878
Go out if you don't want to watch.

398
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,594
No.

399
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,833
Let's start.

400
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,632
Do the same as
with the photo film.

401
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,876
Relax and look at the camera.

402
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,435
What's that noise?

403
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,793
That woman...

404
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,913
Doctor!

405
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,439
Ms Furuhashi!

406
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,595
Ms Furuhashi!

407
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,639
What are you doing?

408
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,671
There were a lot of calls.

409
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,395
"It's a week today", or something.

410
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,795
That girl with the video, isn't it?

411
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,399
I'll call her.

412
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,230
- Goodnight.
- See you.

413
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,392
Hello, this is Kawaguchi.

414
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,591
Hello, Kanae?

415
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,915
Yes.

416
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,439
It's Okazaki.

417
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,236
I watched the video.

418
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,953
Oh, I'm relieved.

419
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,071
I've been worrying.

420
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,430
You don't trust me.

421
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,710
Because it's almost the time.

422
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,837
Listen...

423
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,988
you know, that strange woman.

424
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,399
You mean, the one in the mirror?

425
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,515
Hello?

426
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,792
Um? Yes, that one.

427
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,754
Didn't it look like it changed to
a child for a second?

428
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,155
And the well at the end...

429
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,788
Where's the video now?

430
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,194
I threw it away.

431
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,111
Because it's really...

432
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,312
No one should watch it anymore.

433
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,829
But you can't stop it.

434
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,679
You'll show it to someone, won't you?

435
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,875
Mr Okazaki...

436
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,116
you have to show it.

437
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,595
I don't want you to die, Mr Okazaki.

438
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,958
I know.

439
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,355
- See you then...
- Yeah.

440
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,550
The woman in the mirror.

441
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,433
REPORTER DlES WlTNESSlNG
PSYCHlC TEST.

442
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,877
It's the public demonstration
by Dr Heihachiro lkuma.

443
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,233
He was fired
because of the demonstration.

444
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,553
THE FATAL EXPERlMENT

445
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,435
MS SHlZUKO YAMAMURA, RlGHT,
AND DR lKUMA

446
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,672
Shizuko...

447
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,875
Can you just will someone dead?

448
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,236
Dr lkuma talked about
intention as a living thing.

449
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,156
The energy of thought itself
can become substantial.

450
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,397
For example, to be on the video.

451
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,116
30 years in the well...

452
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,400
The concentrated thoughts
of 30 years.

453
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,913
Her fury.

454
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,677
We've all seen it.

455
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,795
Did they die just by watching
the video?

456
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,479
Takayama,

457
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,511
the father of Asakawa.

458
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,556
Why she involved her father...

459
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,159
The kid must have seen it.

460
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,432
Asakawa's kid.

461
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,557
He's probably
in the same condition as my patient.

462
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,871
In that case, we can't leave him.

463
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,718
Where is Asakawa?

464
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,114
Tell me!

465
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,789
Hello.

466
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,675
Sanae!

467
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,954
Sanae!

468
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,195
Come with me.

469
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,508
Please.

470
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,995
This is just a routine interview,
so please relax.

471
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,433
Oh, wait a moment.

472
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,949
Don't come.

473
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,076
Don't come. Run away!

474
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,678
Can't you hear me?

475
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,154
Go, run away!

476
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,749
What is it?

477
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,759
Mum!

478
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,434
Yoichi!

479
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,708
A monster.

480
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,675
A monster!

481
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,353
A monster!

482
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,754
Murderer!

483
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,359
Monster!

484
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,033
Yoichi!

485
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,439
Yoichi!

486
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,479
Yoichi!

487
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,998
Dad?

488
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,358
Dad!

489
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,316
Didn't we save Yoichi?

490
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,518
The boy you're holding
is not Yoichi anymore.

491
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,072
Yoichi...

492
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,031
Yoichi...

493
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,318
No...

494
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,189
Stop it!

495
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,355
Don't!

496
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,913
OK.

497
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,993
Why can't I erase it?

498
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,555
Where did that story come from?

499
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,354
When people worry,
rumours start flying.

500
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,394
In other words,

501
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,834
people hope things
will turn out like that.

502
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,033
Sir!

503
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,278
What's the matter?

504
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,913
Let's go.

505
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,348
Do you see any resemblance to her?

506
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,312
It looks like her.

507
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,750
Just as eerie.

508
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,237
We'll take some photos.

509
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,752
That's enough.

510
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,715
Sadako.

511
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,230
Why do you keep me alive?

512
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,795
I made you and
your mother into a freak show.

513
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,078
It was me.

514
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,239
Do you want me to return you
to the sea?

515
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,798
Is that what you want?

516
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,315
Do you know the Yamamura house?

517
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,273
There are a lot of Yamamuras.

518
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,392
The one where a woman named Shizuko
used to live.

519
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,675
Oh, that one.

520
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,158
THE YAMAMURA lNN

521
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,994
Hello.

522
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,518
This way, please.

523
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,030
Sorry. Did I wake you?

524
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,593
No.

525
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,948
Well...

526
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,916
Can you promise me something?

527
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,269
What?

528
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,511
No matter who comes to you,

529
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,510
don't do such a thing again.

530
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,556
That's terrible.

531
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,352
Are you on my side?

532
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,789
Yes, I am. Of course.

533
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,593
OK.

534
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,671
If you're looking for Sadako,
I've put her in the sea.

535
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,272
That was all I could do for her.

536
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,909
Come to think of it,

537
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,839
Shizuko used to say the same thing.

538
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,676
She went off to give birth to Sadako,

539
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,791
all on her own.

540
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,869
She came back after the birth,

541
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,878
saying she'd put the baby
away in the sea.

542
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,275
But the next day,

543
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,914
she had a baby in her arms.

544
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,478
That noise...

545
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,075
That's where Sadako was born.

546
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,277
This is called the Children's Limbo.

547
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,279
When the water is high,

548
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,598
it washes away all the unwanted.

549
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,910
Was Sadako's father...

550
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,599
Hello!

551
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,239
Yes?

552
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,716
Is Mai Takano staying here?

553
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,348
No.

554
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,475
At least you have a room, right?

555
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,033
Wait...

556
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,472
Sadako...

557
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,400
You are already dead.

558
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,276
You are already dead.

559
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,472
Oh, I'm so relieved.

560
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,875
Do you remember
your dream last night?

561
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,993
In that case...
think about your mother.

562
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,193
That's good.

563
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,234
Can I have a word?

564
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,519
He is controlled by

565
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,193
anger.

566
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,675
His anger summons Sadako.

567
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,872
He can't control it.

568
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,556
My equipment should arrive today.

569
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,149
I'll try to eliminate
Sadako's energy.

570
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,718
"There's no such thing"
as ghosts or the other world.'

571
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,471
Takayama always criticised me.

572
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,831
But Yoichi isn't strong enough to...

573
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,789
What choice have we?

574
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,312
What happens if the police come?

575
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,914
He channels the energy.
A perfect medium.

576
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,271
I'll do it.

577
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,714
Do you have the same power
as Takayama?

578
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,868
Yes.

579
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,993
It doesn't mean you'll do better
as a medium than the boy.

580
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,076
What if I watch the video...

581
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,479
OK.

582
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,752
- Then all we need is water.
- Water?

583
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,315
Sea water doesn't permeate as well.

584
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,069
We need a lot of fresh water
to absorb Sadako's fury.

585
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,553
With this system,

586
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,753
you conduct the energy he generates
into water, where it dissolves.

587
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,517
Then Sadako will disappear.

588
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,628
- OK. Are we ready?
- Yes.

589
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,316
Take your place.

590
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,669
Come.

591
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,510
Remember, I'm on your side.

592
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,869
OK?

593
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,474
Let's start.

594
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,479
Close your eyes.

595
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,950
Remember what you saw.

596
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,438
What did you see?

597
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,028
Yes.

598
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,151
Both your father and mother died.

599
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,874
You are all on your own.
What did you see?

600
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,913
Shall I tell you?

601
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,510
Your mother died because of her.

602
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,313
She betrayed her.

603
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,789
Yes,

604
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,672
it was my fault.

605
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,915
It looks good.

606
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,348
Keep it up.

607
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,195
Dr Kawajiri, this is...

608
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,388
..it is connected
to the other world...

609
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,351
Sadako...

610
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,511
Sadako...

611
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,239
Take me...

612
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,040
..and kill me.

613
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,872
Take me...

614
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,318
..and put an end to all this.

615
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,633
Are you OK?

616
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,793
Don't let go.

617
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,516
Let me fall, and you'll be safe.

618
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:49,757
"Frolic in brine, goblins be thine"

619
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,752
Hold on to the wall.

620
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,837
I can't support you by myself.

621
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,478
Hold on to the wall.

622
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,874
Mai...

623
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,317
It's enough, it's over.

624
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,439
Yoichi!

625
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,519
Yoichi?

626
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,598
Yoichi!

627
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,953
Take him.

628
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,673
Sir...

629
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,199
Yoichi...

630
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,475
Give your fear to me.

631
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,312
Give it to me.

632
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,435
Give it to me!

633
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,315
Get away!

634
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,873
Take the rope.

635
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,479
Don't look back.

636
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,157
Help... help...

637
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,873
Help... help...

638
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,513
Help...

639
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,118
Why are you the only one saved?

640
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,438
You're not still scared, are you?

641
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:36,038
No. You?

642
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,232
Me?

643
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,116
I'm still scared, a bit.

644
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,678
So how's Okazaki?

645
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,150
Needs to be in hospital for a while.

646
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,078
Hospital?

647
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,069
Where's the key for this?

648
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,679
Key?

649
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,392
Is it this one?

650
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,997
Mr Okazaki,
I need to take photos for your file.

651
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,599
Look this way.

652
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,194
Mr Okazaki...

653
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,992
face this way.

654
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,789
Here you go.

655
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,632
Thank you.
