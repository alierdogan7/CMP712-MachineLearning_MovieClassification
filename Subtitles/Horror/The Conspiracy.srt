528
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,543
It doesn't seem really
all that nefarious.

529
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:15,746
That's because when
my editor at <i>Time</i> Magazine

530
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,915
found out
what I was reporting on,

531
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,216
he butchered the article.

532
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:21,585
JIM: Then why not get rid
of the article entirely?

533
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:24,087
Well, it's in the group's
best interest to have

534
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,557
a little bit of information
out there about themselves.

535
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,959
A total media blackout
is a void

536

just asking to be filled
by fertile imaginations.

537
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,164
I wouldn't be surprised that,
in the very near future,

538
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,502
that Tarsus purposely
lets a little bit
of information out there--

539
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,471
um, news story,
press release,

540
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,408
something that
has the appearance
of being objective,

541
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,643
but has been
engineered by them.

542
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,813
JIM: So that they can
control the message?

543
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,282
And it also acts
as a little bit of a warning.

544
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,519

of how powerful they are.

AARON: Did this man
ever contact you

549
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,604
about the Tarsus Club?

550
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,840
Couldn't honestly say.

551
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,676
But your friend
may have tried to contact me.

552
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,545
But you have to understand
that my article

553

is the only mainstream
document out there

554
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:27,918
that people can find
actual information of Tarsus.

555
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,020
But the truth is,
most of these guys
have monikers

556
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,556

too suspicious ever to meet.

all of this leading?

What is it specifically

559
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:40,097
that the Tarsus
organization is after?

560
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:45,469
Three words:
new world order.

561
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,006

the opportunity

where the rule of law,

565

not the law of the jungle,
governs the conduct of nations.

When we are successful,
and we will be,

at this new world order.

a new world order.

is likely to emerge

01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:00,808
Hello?

[ breathing nervously ]

1061
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,579
Hello?

1062
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:07,014
[ panting ]

1063
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,123
Guys? [ laughs ]

[ all shouting ]

1068
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:54,362
AARON:
What the fuck?

1069
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:55,363
No, no, no, no!

1070
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:56,230
Wait, wait, wait!

1071
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:57,865
Okay, wait!
Wait! I'm sorry!

1072
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:59,500
I'm not a part of this!

1073
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:00,868
I'm not a part of this!

[ Aaron shouting ]

1076
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:05,373
I'm sorry!

1077
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,641
Help!

1078
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:07,708
[ men shouting,
horns blowing ]

1079
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,710
AARON: Oh, no!
I'll just go!

1080
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:11,446
[ branches snapping ]

[ Aaron groans, falls ]

1085
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:29,630

01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,202

Brother! Down here!

1088

[ Aaron breathing nervously ]

[ whispering ] Oh, God.

1102
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:57,712
My God.

1103
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:58,946
Oh, my God.

1104
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,681

1105
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,520
Jim!

1106

Aaron.

Aah!

1112
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,568
Get the fuck
away from me!

[ men shouting ]

1120

[ keyboard clicking ]

1121
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:02,176
The core value
of the Tarsus Club is
communications--

1122
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,412
communications
between governments,

1123
01:18:04,414 --> 01:18:06,580
businesses, individuals.

1124
01:18:06,582 --> 01:18:10,017
And, of course, we're
living in the golden age
of communications

1125
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,452
because of globalization.

1126
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:17,425
Unfortunately, with
the rise of the Internet,

1127
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:19,293
there's a dark side
to globalization.

1128
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:22,363
Essentially, that is
that anyone with a crazy idea

1129
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:25,933
can communicate it
to millions of people
like a virus.

1130
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:28,402
And the Tarsus Club has been
the target of these viruses,

1131
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:31,405
including these
crazy conspiracy theories.

1132
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,573
Well, actually,
it's become something

1133
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:35,476
of a cottage industry,
I think,

1134
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,178
within
conspiracy circles

1135
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,647
to break in
to Tarsus meetings.

1136
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:42,650
In fact, we've grown
so accustomed to it
over the years

1137
01:18:42,652 --> 01:18:46,320
that, uh,
it's almost become
part of the ritual

1138
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,457
to scare people off
who try to break in.

1139
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:54,128
JIM: I was
taken to a back room.

1140
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:57,331
I was told
to let them know

1141
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,600
where the rendezvous point
was with Aaron.

1142
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:02,536
We were questioned
for a very long time,

1143
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:06,841
but, uh, eventually
security let us go.

1144
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:08,542
Even after Aaron realized

1145
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:11,512
that they were
just scaring him,

1146
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:14,315
he was still very upset.

1147
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:19,520
I think Aaron
had been traumatized
by what had happened.

1148
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:21,522
That was the last time
I saw him.

1149
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,730
JENSEN:
To the people screaming
about conspiracy...

1150
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,336
I'll let them in
on a little secret.

1151
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:37,805
It's true.

1152
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:41,242
Global leaders do
get together and collaborate.

1153
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:44,445
Many of them, including
my boss, Murray Chance,

1154
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,414
are working hard
to create a new world

1155
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,250
where all nations
and all people

1156
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:52,553
can come together
in one global community.

1157
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,890
That's what it's all about,

1158
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:59,894
the creation
of a single global community.

1159
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,797
And if
that's a conspiracy...

1160
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,538
If that's a conspiracy,
well, then, yes, we're guilty.

1161
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,708
Hi, bud.

1162
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,447
NICOLE:
Just for the record,

1163
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:23,551
where do you think
Aaron went?

1164
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,590
JIM:
I guess he ended up...

1165
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,031
in the same place
Terrance did, didn't he?

1166
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,872
And I just hope
wherever they are,

1167
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,574
they both feel free.

1168
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:03,524
