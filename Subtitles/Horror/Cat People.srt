1
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,080
Thank you.

2
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,623
You won't believe this,
you've probably heard it before...

3
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:26,557
...but I've never known any artists.

4
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,129
- I am not an artist.
- Well, what's all this?

5
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,097
I do sketches for fashion drawings.

6
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,133
- May I see it?
- Oh, no, it's not good.

7
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:40,003
If I let you see it, you might not
want to know any artists, ever.

8
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,768
I'm afraid it would have to be pretty bad
to do that. Besides, look:

9
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,676
"Let no one say,
and say it to your shame..."

10
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,265
Irena Dubrovna, is that a Russian name?

11
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,345
- No, I'm from Serbia.
- Oh, I see.

12
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:19,208
Would you mind spelling it?

13
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,111
Want to know
how to spell my name?

14
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,782
- Are you going to write me a letter?
- I'd like to write you a letter.

15
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,980
- What about?
- I would say in this letter:

16
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:31,786
"Dear Miss Dubrovna..."
I would say, "Will you have tea with me?"

17
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,930
In that case, I'd just have
to write you another one. I'd say...

18
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,726
Here's my house.

19
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,832
Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like
to have tea in my apartment?

20
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,174
Oh, Miss Dubrovna...

21
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:50,539
...you make life so simple.

22
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,588
You know...

23
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,324
...I never cease to marvel at what lies
behind a brownstone front.

24
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,438
- Well, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

25
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:20,970
But you...

26
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:25,638
- You looked at me in such a funny way.
- I've never had anyone here.

27
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,406
You're the first friend
I met in America.

28
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,582
Oh, I know lots of people in business.

29
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:34,883
Editors, secretaries,
other sketch artists, you know.

30
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:40,290
- But you might be my first real friend.
- Thank you.

31
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,070
- Nice.
- That's Lalage.

32
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,936
- Lalage?
- The perfume I use. I like it.

33
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,547
Perhaps too well. Maybe I use
too much of it, living alone like this.

34
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,515
It's hard to describe.
Not like flowers, exactly. It's...

35
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,845
It's like something warm and living.

36
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:32,010
What's that?

37
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:36,277
It's the lions in the zoo.
One can hear them here often.

38
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:40,855
Many people in this building complain.
The roaring keeps them awake.

39
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,117
- And you don't mind it?
- No.

40
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:46,523
To me, it's the way the sound
of the sea is to others:

41
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:50,598
Natural and soothing. I like it.

42
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,532
Some nights there is another sound,
the panther.

43
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:58,230
It screams like a woman.

44
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,433
I don't like that.

45
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,605
Oh, I hadn't realized how dark
it was getting.

46
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:09,017
I like the dark. It's friendly.

47
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:15,519
No, no, keep still, please.

48
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,111
- Are you admiring my statue?
- Not exactly.

49
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,306
- Who's it supposed to be?
- King John.

50
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,917
Oh, King John, the Magna Carta
and all that stuff?

51
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:45,520
No. King John of Serbia.

52
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,553
He was a fine king.

53
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:51,090
He drove the Mamluks out of Serbia
and freed the people.

54
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,819
- Well, why have this around?
- Well, perhaps you have in your room...

55
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,125
...a picture of George Washington
or Abraham Lincoln.

56
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,893
Well, what does it mean?

57
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,130
- Why is he...? Why is he spearing that cat?
- Oh, it's not really a cat.

58
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:09,301
It's meant to represent the evil ways
into which my village had once fallen.

59
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,837
You see, the Mamluks
came to Serbia long ago...

60
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,041
...and they made the people slaves.

61
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,717
Well, at first, the people were good...

62
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:22,380
...and worshipped God
in a true Christian way.

63
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:26,426
But little by little, the people changed.

64
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,592
When King John drove out
the Mamluks...

65
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,462
...and came to our village...

66
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,070
...he found dreadful things.

67
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,664
People bowed down to Satan...

68
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,174
...and said their Masses to him.

69
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:46,006
They had become witches...

70
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:48,241
...and were evil.

71
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,381
Well, King John put some of them
to the sword...

72
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,551
...but some...

73
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,319
...the wisest and the most wicked...

74
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:01,562
...escaped into the mountains.

75
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,459
Now do you understand?

76
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,398
Well, I still don't see
what it has to do with you.

77
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,202
Those who escaped,
the wicked ones...

78
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,903
...their legend haunts the village
where I was born.

79
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,956
Boys who come to tea
can't expect to stay to dinner.

80
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,059
Some other time perhaps.

81
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,696
Tomorrow?

82
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:43,205
Well, what time tomorrow?

83
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,964
Dinner?

84
00:09:12,602 --> 00:09:14,536
A little more to the left, Harry.

85
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,571
Easy. Just a hair.

86
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:23,769
- I'm afraid she's gonna be all right, Alice.
- She's got what it takes, commodore.

87
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,198
Isn't it a darling?

88
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,665
- Where'd you get it?
- I bought it.

89
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,108
- You're not going in for cats, are you?
- No, I bought it for a friend.

90
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,477
We arrive at the inescapable conclusion
that our Oliver has a girl.

91
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,015
A brilliant deduction, Carver.

92
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,345
- I want to show you something.
- A girlfriend?

93
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,511
- A girl.
- Anybody I know?

94
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,486
Not yet, but I know you'll like her.

95
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:11,192
Well, if you like her,
she's okay with me.

96
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:26,030
- Well, hello.
- Look, Irena. I brought you a present.

97
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:44,220
Why, you little devil.

98
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:47,819
Oh, it's all right.

99
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:51,057
It's just that cats
don't seem to like me.

100
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,962
Yeah, but this is only a kitten.

101
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,733
It's very friendly.
When I had it in the office...

102
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,567
...Alice, that's the girl who works
in our department...

103
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,174
...it played with her.

104
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:04,309
Cats just don't like me.

105
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,038
Oh, I know what we can do.

106
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,183
- You got it at a pet store, didn't you?
- Yes.

107
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,685
Good. Well, we could exchange it
for some other pet.

108
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:15,886
I'll get my coat.

109
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,648
- I'd like to exchange this kitten for a canary.
- You'll have to talk louder.

110
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,122
- What did you say?
- I can't understand a word you say.

111
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,903
I can't imagine what...

112
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:04,835
Oh, landie, dearie me. I can't imagine
what got into them.

113
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,304
All that caterwauling.

114
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,171
The last time they did that was
when an alley cat got in...

115
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,245
...and ate up one of my
nice Rice finches.

116
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,575
I wanted to exchange this kitten
for a bird.

117
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,944
Why, of course.
I have some lovely canaries.

118
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:19,986
One little lemon-colored fellow
with top notes like Caruso.

119
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,622
As peaceful as my dream of heaven.

120
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,991
Shall we go back now
and select just which little birdie?

121
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,429
You go, please, Oliver.
You pick the one you like.

122
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,602
I'd rather stay here.

123
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,967
Of course. I'll only be a minute.

124
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,639
Animals are ever so psychic.

125
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,176
There are some people
who just can't come in here.

126
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,074
My dear brother's wife, for instance.

127
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:48,410
She's a very nice girl.
I have nothing against her...

128
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:52,486
...but you just should see what happens
when she puts her foot inside this place.

129
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,215
The cats particularly.
They seem to know.

130
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:59,088
You can fool everybody, but landie,
dearie me, you can't fool a cat.

131
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:03,129
They seem to know who's not right,
if you know what I mean.

132
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,666
Here we are.
Isn't he a ducky little angel?

133
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,999
- This is it.
- Thank you.

134
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:29,285
- What do you think of it?
- Oh, he is sweet.

135
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,323
He will like me very much.
You will see.

136
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:35,725
- I like to be liked.
- That ought to be easy. Really easy.

137
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,975
- Irena.
- Yes.

138
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:54,647
- I've been asleep.
- I know.

139
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,445
It couldn't have been
very entertaining for you.

140
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,055
I was watching you.

141
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,014
And that was fun?

142
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,491
Do you love me, Irena?

143
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:12,099
You know I love you, don't you?

144
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,741
I've never kissed you.

145
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,969
Do you know, that's funny.

146
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,439
- Why?
- Well...

147
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,512
When people in America are in love,
or even think they're in love...

148
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,155
...they've usually kissed long ago.

149
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,649
Well?

150
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:44,863
Irena, what's wrong?

151
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:49,266
I've lived in dread of this moment.

152
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:53,600
I've never wanted to love you.

153
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,077
I've stayed away from people...

154
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,239
...I lived alone.

155
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,515
- I never wanted this to happen.
- But you just told me you love me.

156
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,514
I do.

157
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,822
I do.

158
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,058
I've fled from the past...

159
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,324
...from things you could never know...

160
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,429
...or understand.

161
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,433
Evil things.

162
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,995
Evil.

163
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,671
Irena...

164
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,811
...you've told me something
of the past.

165
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,379
About King John and the witches
in the village...

166
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,448
...and the cat people
descended from them.

167
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,107
They're fairy tales, Irena.

168
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:39,448
Fairy tales heard in your childhood.
Nothing more than that.

169
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,781
They've nothing to do with you, really.

170
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,118
You're Irena.
You're here in America.

171
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:49,228
You're so normal, you're in love with me,
Oliver Reed, a good, plain <i>Americano. </i>

172
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,523
You're so normal,
you're gonna marry me...

173
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,160
...and those fairy tales, you can tell them
to our children. They'll love them.

174
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,291
<i>Comitadji. </i>

175
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:23,795
Oh, Mr. Carver, you should not call
a good man that.

176
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,594
But it's Serbian. I got it
from my barber this afternoon.

177
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,259
But you might insult him.

178
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:32,897
- <i>Comitadji</i> means "thief," "bandit."
- I've been double-crossed.

179
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:40,774
Oliver's bride seems to be a very nice girl.
And a very pretty one too.

180
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:43,847
Carver tells me she's a bit odd.

181
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,477
- He's worried about the marriage.
- Nonsense, Irena's a grand girl.

182
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,022
She and Oliver are going
to be very happy together.

183
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,454
I certainly hope so.

184
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,790
- To the bride.
- To the bride.

185
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:11,271
Look at that woman.
Isn't she something?

186
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,512
Looks like a cat.

187
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,056
Thank you so much
for this lovely party, Alice.

188
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,483
I didn't know
there was a Serbian restaurant.

189
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,924
Anything you want to know
about this city, ask me.

190
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,155
I know all the unimportant details.

191
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:58,889
Well, how do you like that?

192
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,086
What did that woman
say to you, darling?

193
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,093
Well, what did she say?

194
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,133
Now, wait a minute.
It can't be that serious.

195
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,667
Just one single word.

196
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,464
She greeted me.

197
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:13,337
She called me sister.

198
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,535
You saw her, Oliver.

199
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,476
- You saw what she looked like.
- Oh, the cat people.

200
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:24,017
She looks like a cat, so she must be one
of the cat people. One of King John's pets.

201
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,711
Irena, you crazy kid.

202
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,223
I know a joke about weddings.

203
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,694
Why would my wedding
be a dollar-and-cents wedding, eh?

204
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,296
All right, why?

205
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,697
I haven't a dollar,
and me girl hasn't any sense.

206
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,135
- That's a corny joke even for you, doc.
- Come on, Carver.

207
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,886
What is it, darling?

208
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:09,430
I'm... I'm going to beg.

209
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,429
Mrs. Reed.

210
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,603
It's nice to hear that. Nice.

211
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,009
- I want to be Mrs. Reed.
- Well, you are.

212
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:25,277
But I want to be Mrs. Reed really.

213
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:28,940
I want to be everything
that name means to me.

214
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,514
And I can't. I can't.

215
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,555
Oliver...

216
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,324
...be kind, be patient.

217
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,288
Let me have time.

218
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,292
Time to get over that feeling
there's something evil in me.

219
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,323
Darling...

220
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:49,296
...you can have all the time
there is in the world if you want it...

221
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,803
...and all the patience
and kindness there's in me.

222
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,775
Only a little time, Oliver.

223
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,611
I don't want more than that.

224
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,385
Good night, Irena.

225
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,481
Good night, Oliver.

226
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,515
Good night, Irena.

227
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:05,035
Well, ain't seen you here
in some time, ma'am.

228
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:08,114
I've been married.
I've been married for almost a month.

229
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,075
That's what I tell this critter.

230
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:13,312
Nobody comes to see him
when they're happy. No, sir.

231
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:16,082
The monkey house and the aviary
gets the happy customers.

232
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,748
But he's beautiful.

233
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,451
No, he ain't beautiful.

234
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,797
He's an evil critter, ma'am.

235
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,958
You read your Bible. In Revelations...

236
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:30,127
...where the book's talking about
the worst beast of them all.

237
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,670
It says:

238
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,104
"And the beast which I saw...

239
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,107
...was like unto a leopard."

240
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:39,075
- Like unto a leopard.
- Yes, ma'am.

241
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:42,511
Like a leopard, but not a leopard.

242
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:44,652
I guess that fits this fella.

243
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,947
Yes, it fits him.

244
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,498
Best wishes for your marriage, ma'am.

245
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,879
Would you like some sherry?

246
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:38,019
If you're determined to mourn that bird,
we'll have a regular wake.

247
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:41,253
It's not just because the bird died.

248
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:42,862
It's me.

249
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:46,660
I envy every woman I see on the street.

250
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:50,396
- They can't match your little finger.
- I envy them.

251
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,531
They are happy.
They make their husbands happy.

252
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,610
They lead normal, happy lives.

253
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,612
They're free.

254
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,617
- Do you know what happened to the bird?
- It died.

255
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,886
It died of fright when I tried
to take it in my hand.

256
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,530
All right, the bird was afraid of you.
That's nothing.

257
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:18,598
I had a rabbit once that hated me...

258
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,395
...yet I grew up to be
quite a nice fella.

259
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:25,200
Oliver.

260
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,775
When I went past
the panther's cage...

261
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,436
...I had to open the box.

262
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,447
I had to throw the bird to him.

263
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:40,611
Do you understand?
I had to. I had to do it.

264
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,886
That's what frightens me.

265
00:25:56,671 --> 00:26:00,698
Irena, I've been trying
to kid you out of it.

266
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,137
Maybe that's wrong.

267
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,041
- I've tried to...
- No one could have been more gentle...

268
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:07,442
...or more patient.

269
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:10,915
I've tried to make you realize
all these stories are so much nonsense.

270
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:15,483
But now I see it's not the stories.
It's the fact that you believe them.

271
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:18,156
We've got to have help, Irena.

272
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,059
Not that sort of help.

273
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,859
There's something wrong, and we have
to face it in an intelligent way.

274
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:31,164
We don't need a King John
with fire and sword.

275
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,332
We need someone who can find
the reason for your belief and cure it.

276
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,144
That's what we need.

277
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,573
A psychiatrist.

278
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,174
Oh, find one for me, Oliver.

279
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:48,549
The best one. The very best one.

280
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:52,318
You were saying, the cats...

281
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:55,090
They torment me.

282
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,464
I wake in the night...

283
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:01,992
...and the tread of their feet
whispers in my brain.

284
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:05,530
I have no peace...

285
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:09,066
...for they are in me.

286
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,312
In me.

287
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:16,379
In me.

288
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:45,103
Hypnosis always tires me.

289
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,908
Some of my patients, too,
find it exhausting.

290
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,446
It's only that I remember nothing.

291
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,986
It's my duty to remember.
I have it all here.

292
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,484
Most interesting.

293
00:27:56,858 --> 00:28:01,124
You told me of your village
and the people and their strange beliefs.

294
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:04,823
I am so ashamed.
It must seem so childish.

295
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:08,162
And the cat women of your village too.
You told me of them.

296
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,965
Women who, in jealousy or anger
or out of their own corrupt passions...

297
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,234
...can change into great cats,
like panthers.

298
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:18,475
And if one of these women
were to fall in love...

299
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,706
...and if her lover were to kiss her,
take her into his embrace...

300
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:24,818
...she would be driven by her own evil
to kill him.

301
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:29,017
That's what you believe and fear,
isn't it?

302
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,526
These things are very simple
to psychiatrists.

303
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,397
You told me about your childhood.

304
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:41,296
Perhaps we will find this trouble stems
from some early experience.

305
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,696
You said you didn't know your father.

306
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:47,899
That he died in some mysterious
accident in the forest before your birth.

307
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:51,307
And because of that, the children
teased you and called your mother...

308
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,572
...a witch, a cat woman.

309
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:59,717
These childhood tragedies
are inclined to corrode the soul...

310
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:02,083
...to leave a canker in the mind.

311
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,623
But we will try to repair the damage.

312
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:07,618
You're not to worry.

313
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,128
And what shall I tell my husband?

314
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,858
Naturally, he is anxious
to have some word.

315
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,492
What does one tell a husband?
One tells him nothing.

316
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:32,416
Alice, it's so nice to see you.

317
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,049
Hello, darling.

318
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,656
- How did you make out with Louis?
- Louis?

319
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,586
Dr. Judd.

320
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:40,722
Alice knows, darling.

321
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:46,199
Of course. Didn't I suggest Dr. Judd?
I met him on the commodore's boat.

322
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,393
The way he goes around kissing hands
makes me want to spit cotton.

323
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:52,706
But I guess he knows all
there is to know about psychiatry.

324
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:59,636
I told Alice. I knew she'd know
some good doctor.

325
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:03,583
I don't see why that was necessary.

326
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:08,556
Sorry. I seem to have put
my big foot in it.

327
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,757
I'm sorry, Irena.

328
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:19,297
I'm sure neither Oliver nor I
had any notion of offending you.

329
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,626
I'm dreadfully sorry.

330
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,236
Goodbye, Alice.

331
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:37,078
- Darling, really, there's no reason to...
- But, Oliver...

332
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,152
...how can you discuss such things?

333
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,552
Such intimate things about me?
How much did you tell her?

334
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:47,058
You can tell Alice anything. She's
a good egg, she understands anything.

335
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:51,358
There are some things a woman doesn't
want other women to understand.

336
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,292
Irena.

337
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,635
I woke up. You were gone.

338
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:07,400
- What's wrong, darling?
- I couldn't sleep. I went out.

339
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,476
- Where'd you go?
- Just walked.

340
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,703
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

341
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,574
I just didn't think.

342
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,412
Oliver...

343
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,611
...we should never quarrel.

344
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:23,655
Never let me feel jealousy or anger.

345
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:27,818
Whatever is in me is held in,
is kept harmless...

346
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,429
...when I am happy.

347
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,758
I'd turn handsprings, darling.

348
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,595
I'd dance in the streets
to make you happy.

349
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:43,868
Toward the sheer line.

350
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,079
Sixty-two degrees.

351
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,949
Hey.

352
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:57,023
I'm sorry. I must have given you
the wrong figure. Let me try again.

353
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,818
Wait, let's have a cigarette first.

354
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:02,121
That's the third wrong figure
you've given me this morning.

355
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,321
Getting careless in my old age.

356
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:07,832
Something's on your mind.
Anything wrong?

357
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,235
Nope.

358
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,472
Must be marriage.

359
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,046
Well, in a way, it is.

360
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,139
I'm worried about Irena.

361
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:23,806
But I thought she was going
to Dr. Judd.

362
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:27,318
Yeah, that's what I thought.
But I ran into Dr. Judd this morning.

363
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:29,547
She hasn't been back
since the first visit.

364
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:33,091
But you told me she seemed
so anxious to be cured.

365
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:37,327
- Apparently not.
- I'm sorry, Ollie.

366
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,830
Must make you very unhappy.

367
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,195
You know, it's a funny thing.

368
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,771
I've never been unhappy before.

369
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:51,441
Things have always gone swell for me.
I had a grand time as a kid.

370
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,705
Lots of fun at school...

371
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:57,647
...and here at the office with you
and the commodore and doc.

372
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,080
That's why I don't know
what to do about all this.

373
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,380
I've just never been unhappy.

374
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,429
Hey.

375
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,397
Now, wait a minute.

376
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:24,139
I can't help it.
I just can't help it.

377
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,312
I can't bear to see you unhappy.

378
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:31,213
I love you too darn much,
and I don't care if you do know it, Ollie.

379
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,114
I love you.

380
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:37,782
I'm sorry. Forget it.

381
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,622
- There's Irena, you're in love with her.
- I don't know.

382
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:46,061
All this trouble has made me think...

383
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,728
...I don't know what love really is.

384
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,828
I don't know...

385
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,806
...even whether I'm in love with Irena.
- I know what love is.

386
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,044
It's understanding.

387
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:01,847
It's you and me,
and let the rest of the world go by.

388
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:06,619
It's just the two of us living our lives
together, happily and proudly.

389
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:09,287
No self-torture and no doubt.

390
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:12,154
It's enduring and it's everlasting.

391
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,326
Nothing can change it.

392
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,956
Nothing can change us, Ollie.

393
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,092
That's what I think love is.

394
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,232
Well...

395
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,134
...that isn't the way
I feel about Irena.

396
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,902
It's a different feeling.

397
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:30,568
I'm drawn to her.

398
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,703
There's a warmth from her...

399
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,441
...that pulls at me.

400
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:39,517
I have to watch her
when she's in the room.

401
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:42,315
I have to touch her when she's near.

402
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,652
But I don't really know her.

403
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:49,319
In many ways, we're strangers.

404
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,065
You and I...

405
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,258
...we'll never be strangers.

406
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,696
You forgot your key.

407
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:30,736
Oh, I'm always forgetting it.
But ain't no worry in it.

408
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,669
Nobody would want to steal
one of them critters.

409
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,874
You resist temptation admirably.

410
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:46,884
- Temptation?
- The key.

411
00:36:47,088 --> 00:36:49,886
- Why would I want it?
- For many reasons.

412
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:54,756
There is, in some cases, a psychic
need to loose evil upon the world.

413
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:58,057
And we all of us carry within us
a desire for death.

414
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:02,225
You fear the panther, yet you're drawn
to him again and again.

415
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,000
Couldn't you turn to him
as an instrument of death?

416
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,800
You didn't come back to see me Friday,
I've had to come to you.

417
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:15,381
- Well, how did you know where to find me?
- You told me many things.

418
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,411
Why didn't you come back?

419
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:20,645
I don't feel you can help me.

420
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,255
You're very wise,
you know a great deal...

421
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:27,190
...yet when you speak of the soul,
you mean the mind.

422
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:31,354
- And it is not my mind that is troubled.
- What a clever girl.

423
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,126
All the psychologists
have tried for years to find...

424
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,497
...that subtle difference
between mind and soul.

425
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,933
And you found it.

426
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:40,505
It does seem presumptuous of me,
doesn't it?

427
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:42,632
Goodbye, doctor.

428
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,060
Irena.

429
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:13,663
I'm worried. What's happening to us?

430
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,570
I love you, Oliver.

431
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:17,836
I know, but people can love...

432
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:20,378
...and people can still drift apart.

433
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,312
And that's what I feel
is happening to us.

434
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,818
We don't talk together openly.

435
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:29,252
- You're not frank with me.
- I've never lied to you.

436
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:33,754
I ran into Dr. Judd today.

437
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,831
- You haven't been back to see him.
- He cannot help me.

438
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,731
Well, you won't let him help you.
You won't let me help you.

439
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,302
You won't even help yourself.

440
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:46,503
It's what I said to Alice
this afternoon.

441
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,665
- You're content to go on as we are...
- Alice.

442
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,508
Oh, I... I promised you
we'd never quarrel.

443
00:38:58,185 --> 00:38:59,516
Let's calm down a bit.

444
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,749
I'll go back to the office.

445
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:06,493
I've got some work to do.

446
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,616
Oh, do you wanna go up
to the office, Mr. Reed?

447
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,917
I think I'll go around to Sally Lunn's, get
a cup of coffee before I get to work.

448
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:38,854
I'll be back.

449
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:56,342
- Hello, Mr. Reed.
- Minnie.

450
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,740
Maybe you'd like some nice
chicken gumbo today?

451
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:00,505
No, thanks, Minnie.

452
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:03,241
How about some apple pie
and a cup of coffee?

453
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:04,748
Yes, sir.

454
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:08,284
My goodness, don't nobody
like chicken gumbo?

455
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:28,974
Hello?

456
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:31,600
Hello?

457
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,441
<i>Hello? </i>

458
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:35,843
<i>Hello? </i>

459
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:45,451
John Paul Jones, don't you hate
people who do that?

460
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,599
Good night, John Paul.

461
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:12,980
Here, Mrs. Agnew, new
matchbooks for your collection.

462
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:14,815
Oh, thank you, Miss Moore.

463
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:17,480
Chartreuse. Ain't that elegant?

464
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,259
Too bad you wasn't here
just a minute ago.

465
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:22,588
- Mr. Reed looked in.
- Oh, where did he go?

466
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,754
Said he was going around
to Sally Lunn's.

467
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:28,595
- I'll see if I can catch him. Good night.
- Good night, Miss Moore.

468
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,943
- Could you squeeze the coffee pot for me?
- Hello.

469
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:43,607
I sure could, only this coffee's
been working so long it's got muscles.

470
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:47,487
What are you doing in this part of town
at this hour of night?

471
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:51,384
Stormy weather.

472
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:06,632
You're going to have to solve
your problems your own way.

473
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:09,037
I'm going to drink up and go home.

474
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:14,506
I think you'd better go home too
and make it up with Irena.

475
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:16,912
Alice, you're very swell.

476
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:20,053
That's what makes me dangerous.
I'm the new type of other woman.

477
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:21,711
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.

478
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:23,754
- Good night, Minnie.
- Good night.

479
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:37,026
- You cold?
- A cat just walked over my grave.

480
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,776
Don't you want me to walk you home?

481
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:49,643
No, thanks. I'm a big girl now
and I'm not afraid.

482
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,843
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

483
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:31,078
Climb on, sister. Are you riding with me,
or ain't you?

484
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:37,490
- You look as if you'd seen a ghost.
- Did you see it?

485
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:36,481
Taxi, lady?

486
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:05,039
No, please, don't. Don't touch me.

487
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,179
Irena.

488
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,613
I'm sorry.

489
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:15,812
I've been worried to death.
I didn't know where you were. I thought...

490
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:21,459
What happened tonight
happens in every family.

491
00:46:21,628 --> 00:46:23,687
I was all on edge.

492
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,125
You've got to understand
and you've got to forgive me.

493
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:32,639
I forgive you.

494
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:59,359
- Irena.
- What?

495
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,496
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

496
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,301
...<i>to loose evil upon the world. </i>

497
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:42,602
<i>There is, in some cases, a psychic</i>
<i>need to loose evil upon the world. </i>

498
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:47,945
<i>There is, in some cases, </i>
<i>a psychic need, a desire for death. </i>

499
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:51,881
...<i>to loose evil. A desire for death. </i>

500
00:47:52,052 --> 00:47:54,919
<i>A psychic need. The key. </i>

501
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,086
<i>The key. </i>

502
00:47:57,357 --> 00:47:59,291
<i>The key. </i>

503
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,324
<i>The key. </i>

504
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:44,495
I'm afraid this is dull for Irena.

505
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,071
Darling, there are some
beautiful moderns upstairs.

506
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,539
- Why don't you take a look at them.
- But I like these little boats.

507
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:52,303
I want to be with you.

508
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,709
- Don't send me away.
- We're not sending you away.

509
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:56,872
We just don't want you to be bored.

510
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,514
We'll meet you in the main lobby
in an hour.

511
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:06,583
Ollie, look, a drawing of the <i>Victory</i>.

512
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:10,354
You know, that's the last man-of-war
with a lateen sail aft.

513
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,143
- Could I have the key to the swimming pool?
- Of course, dearie.

514
00:49:58,311 --> 00:49:59,835
What a darling kitten.

515
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:03,380
Yeah. It's one of four.
A tabby had them about a month ago.

516
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,449
- Turn the lights out when you're through.
- I won't forget.

517
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,354
Hello?

518
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:17,959
Yeah.

519
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,929
- Just a moment, dearie. Yes?
- Is Miss Moore in?

520
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,195
She just went downstairs
to the swimming pool.

521
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,271
Would it be all right
if I went to see her?

522
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,204
Of course, dearie.
Right down them steps there.

523
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,869
Oh, gee, I can't tonight.

524
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,800
Help!

525
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,039
Help!

526
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,151
Gee whiz, Mrs. Hanson.

527
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:25,387
Help!

528
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:37,936
What is the matter, Alice?

529
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,670
- Gee whiz, dearie, are you all right?
- It's nothing.

530
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:49,373
It was dark down here, and Mrs. Reed
coming in unexpectedly frightened me.

531
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:50,914
I'm terribly sorry.

532
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,788
No, don't go. I'm coming right out.

533
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:03,196
Sorry to have disturbed you, Alice.

534
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:06,594
I missed you and Oliver,
and I thought you might know where he is.

535
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:11,100
We waited for you at the museum.
You'll probably find him at home.

536
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,001
If you don't mind then, I'll run on.

537
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:31,757
- Could I have my robe, please?
- Sure.

538
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,852
Gee whiz, honey, it's torn to ribbons.

539
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,842
Thank you for coming
at so late an hour, Dr. Judd.

540
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:56,311
I phoned you because I'm troubled.
I think you can help me.

541
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:59,081
How much do you believe
about the cat people?

542
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:00,480
The cat people?

543
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,623
- The story Mrs. Reed told me?
- Yes.

544
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,851
I believe, my dear Miss Moore,
exactly as I told Mrs. Reed:

545
00:54:08,028 --> 00:54:13,022
The story is a product of her own fear,
her own overworked imagination.

546
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,929
What would you say, Dr. Judd,
if I were to tell you...

547
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:18,570
...that I believe Irena's story?
- Yes?

548
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:21,737
Twice I've been followed
by something that was not human...

549
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:24,672
...something that attempted
to take my life.

550
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:28,342
I believe that was the cat form
of Irena.

551
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,006
But why should she wish to harm you?

552
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:33,352
Because I'm in love with her husband.

553
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,745
My dear Miss Moore...

554
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:38,618
...this story grows more
and more charming.

555
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:41,352
Simpler too, all the time.

556
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:44,897
You're both victims of fear.

557
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:48,728
Mrs. Reed fears the past,
and you fear the present.

558
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:51,700
Mrs. Reed has a very strong
imagination...

559
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,896
...and you have
an equally strong conscience.

560
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:56,736
Dr. Judd, the danger that threatened me
was very real.

561
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,435
You disappoint me, Miss Moore.

562
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:03,408
Here is my robe.

563
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:10,019
To understand this,
I should first have to hear...

564
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,852
...Mrs. Reed's version of the story myself.

565
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,890
That should be a most
interesting interview.

566
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,496
I shouldn't advise you
to see her alone.

567
00:55:18,665 --> 00:55:21,725
Do you think I'm afraid
of so charming a lady?

568
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,029
Dr. Judd, I know you don't believe me,
but you must be careful.

569
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:27,696
Oh, you want me to carry
some means of protection.

570
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,343
A gun, perhaps, with a silver bullet.
Is that what you mean?

571
00:55:31,511 --> 00:55:34,036
If you are lucky enough to have one.

572
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:37,046
Of course...

573
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:40,410
...this isn't silver.

574
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,084
Good night, Miss Moore.

575
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:53,760
You say you have lapses of memory
for which you cannot account.

576
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,265
They are becoming more frequent,
and you're afraid.

577
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,370
Help me.

578
00:55:58,538 --> 00:56:01,098
I can't help you.
You're not truthful with me.

579
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:05,074
But I am. I've told you everything.
I have not lied to you.

580
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,408
Do you sincerely believe that
if your husband were to kiss you...

581
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:11,778
...you would change into a cat
and rend him to bits?

582
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,852
I don't know. I am only afraid.

583
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:19,087
And if I were to kiss you?

584
00:56:20,226 --> 00:56:23,855
I only know that I should not like
to be kissed by you.

585
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,225
My dear Mrs. Reed,
sometimes in my profession...

586
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:33,668
...there comes a contest of wills
between the doctor and his patient.

587
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:37,638
Patients are clever. Very clever.

588
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,837
And they can fool the doctor
sometimes.

589
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,583
You are very clever.

590
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:48,983
And perhaps you enjoy this little game
you are having with me.

591
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,680
But I shall discover your secret.

592
00:56:51,858 --> 00:56:55,123
Dr. Judd, believe me.
I beg you to believe me.

593
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,925
I have no secret. I told you everything.
I have not lied to you.

594
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,193
I need your help.

595
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,736
I can't help you.

596
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:07,997
But I can warn you.

597
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,734
These hallucinations approach insanity.

598
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,869
This nonsense about Miss Moore
at the park and in the swimming pool...

599
00:57:15,048 --> 00:57:18,745
...it's a deterioration of the mind,
escape into fantasy.

600
00:57:18,918 --> 00:57:20,909
And it's dangerous.

601
00:57:21,888 --> 00:57:23,549
At this moment...

602
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:27,716
...I could go before a board
and have you put away for observation.

603
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:30,761
You are that close to real insanity.

604
00:57:35,602 --> 00:57:37,297
I can't help you.

605
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,301
You can only help yourself.

606
00:57:39,472 --> 00:57:42,737
You keep going back
to the mad legends of your birthplace.

607
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:44,672
Forget them.

608
00:57:44,844 --> 00:57:47,870
You surround yourself
with cat objects, pictures.

609
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:51,448
Get rid of them. Lead a normal life.

610
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:55,080
You know, for the first time
you've really helped me.

611
00:57:55,255 --> 00:57:57,951
Maybe it's because you interest me.

612
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:23,406
Oliver.

613
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,108
I went back to Dr. Judd's office.

614
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,717
I'm no longer afraid.

615
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:32,791
Believe me, Irena, I'd have been
the happiest man in the world...

616
00:58:32,959 --> 00:58:34,859
...if you told me that
a little while ago.

617
00:58:35,395 --> 00:58:37,488
But things have changed.

618
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:42,631
I had to learn, maybe through
this marriage of ours.

619
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:45,166
I didn't want to tell you this...

620
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:48,133
...but now, you see, I have to.

621
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:50,705
I love Alice.

622
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,101
Irena, it's too late.

623
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,906
Too late.

624
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:59,542
Well, there seems only one decent thing
for me to do.

625
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:02,149
I'll give you a divorce.

626
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,720
- Believe me, it's better this way.
- Better?

627
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:09,762
- Better for whom?
- Irena, l...

628
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:11,658
Speak.

629
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:13,922
You can't speak.

630
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,261
There's nothing you can say.

631
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,934
There's only silence.

632
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,972
But I love silence.

633
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,080
I love loneliness.

634
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:31,817
And they... They are in me.

635
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,613
Their strength, warmth.

636
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:37,915
They're soft. They're soft.

637
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:41,686
- Irena, you're talking like an insane woman.
- Please go.

638
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:45,361
I want you to go, please.

639
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,459
Go.

640
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,263
Go.

641
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:16,652
Bavarian cream?

642
01:00:19,932 --> 01:00:21,729
Roquefort?

643
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,104
And you get the apple pie.

644
01:00:26,973 --> 01:00:30,101
I have pointed out
two alternatives, Mr. Reed:

645
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:32,870
Either have her put away
for observation and restraint...

646
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,911
...or have your marriage annulled.

647
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:37,242
It's tough for Oliver
either way, doctor.

648
01:00:37,784 --> 01:00:41,151
As a psychiatrist, I should recommend
that you have her put away.

649
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:44,586
As your friend, however, I have
much more reasonable advice to offer.

650
01:00:44,757 --> 01:00:46,918
I think you should have
your marriage annulled.

651
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,653
In that way, you are free
of responsibility.

652
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:52,957
- You two could marry.
- And if Irena's sent away?

653
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:56,465
The law is quite explicit.
One cannot divorce an insane person.

654
01:00:56,803 --> 01:00:59,203
If she's not well,
I've got to take care of her.

655
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:00,930
It's the only right thing, Ollie.

656
01:01:01,107 --> 01:01:03,701
As you will. I'll have
the commitment papers drawn up...

657
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:07,004
...and arrange an interview
with Mrs. Reed at her apartment tonight.

658
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,943
Shall we say 6:00?

659
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,834
Let's not play that.

660
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:33,034
I don't think Irena's coming.
We've waited an hour and a half.

661
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,371
Perhaps it's useless to wait.

662
01:01:37,477 --> 01:01:39,775
I don't think she intends coming.

663
01:01:40,313 --> 01:01:42,611
She's probably walking in the park.

664
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:50,856
Ollie, let's get back to the office.
We've had a broken-up day...

665
01:01:51,023 --> 01:01:54,015
...and there's lots of work to be done.
- Suits me.

666
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,345
How stupid of me, I left
my walking stick in the apartment.

667
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:21,384
- I'll get it for you.
- No, it's my fault.

668
01:02:21,554 --> 01:02:23,784
Give me the key.
I shall only be a moment.

669
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:52,251
Five and a half.

670
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:54,575
Five and a half.

671
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:56,449
And...

672
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:01,053
...one and three-eighths.

673
01:03:01,494 --> 01:03:04,088
And one and three-eighths.

674
01:03:04,263 --> 01:03:05,890
There.

675
01:03:06,332 --> 01:03:08,163
I'll get it.

676
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:15,270
Hello?

677
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:17,874
Hello?

678
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:20,544
Hello?

679
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:25,407
They hung up on me.

680
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:29,280
- That's funny.
- What?

681
01:03:29,455 --> 01:03:31,855
It happened once before like that.

682
01:03:32,091 --> 01:03:34,719
The telephone rang, and I answered.

683
01:03:35,127 --> 01:03:37,459
There was someone
on the other end of the line.

684
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,495
I could almost hear them listening.

685
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:42,930
And then there was a little click
as they hung up the receiver.

686
01:03:43,536 --> 01:03:46,801
That was the night
I was followed on the transverse.

687
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,802
Ollie...

688
01:03:48,975 --> 01:03:51,500
...let's get out of here. I'm afraid.

689
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:54,238
That was Irena.
I know it was Irena who called.

690
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:57,405
She could call from downstairs.
She may be on her way up now.

691
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,312
Get your things.

692
01:04:04,524 --> 01:04:07,584
The door's open. We can see
to get out into the hall.

693
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:14,197
I'll turn out the table lights.

694
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,261
It's shut now.
Just a minute ago, it was open.

695
01:04:27,547 --> 01:04:29,174
It's locked.

696
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,839
Irena.

697
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,835
Irena.

698
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:05,247
Leave us, Irena!

699
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:18,522
In the name of God, leave us in peace.

700
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:36,776
Come on.

701
01:05:57,069 --> 01:05:59,435
Let's go down the stairs.

702
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:09,982
Don't, Alice. It's gone.
Everything's all right. Don't be afraid.

703
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:12,049
I'm not afraid.

704
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,549
Look.

705
01:06:17,657 --> 01:06:21,354
Irena's perfume. Strong. Sweet.

706
01:06:32,104 --> 01:06:34,265
I need a drink.

707
01:06:56,128 --> 01:06:57,652
- Yes?
- <i>Dr. Judd. </i>

708
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:59,024
Miss Moore?

709
01:06:59,198 --> 01:07:03,157
Yes. We've been trying to get you
on the phone, Dr. Judd. I called your hotel.

710
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:07,237
Yes, I know, that's what
I want to talk about. Are you alone?

711
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:10,637
You'd better leave then.
She may be on her way back now.

712
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,706
But she is dangerous, Dr. Judd.
I warn you.

713
01:07:16,082 --> 01:07:19,210
<i>Hello? Hello, Dr. Judd? </i>

714
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:24,117
Dr. Judd?

715
01:07:24,857 --> 01:07:27,121
I think Irena just came in.
He hung up on me.

716
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,885
Come on.

717
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:31,161
We'll get a taxi.

718
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,160
You're late, aren't you?

719
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:37,564
I kept my appointment.

720
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:41,099
You see, I've never believed
your story.

721
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:44,669
I am not afraid of you.

722
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:48,439
I take you in my arms.

723
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:52,181
So little, so soft.

724
01:07:52,785 --> 01:07:55,151
This warm perfume in your hair.

725
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,982
Your body.

726
01:07:59,024 --> 01:08:01,549
Don't be afraid of me, Irena.

727
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:29,008
He's dead.

728
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,877
Mr. Reed. Oh, Mr. Reed.

729
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:41,850
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Reed.

730
01:09:42,027 --> 01:09:45,360
Sue Ellen and I phoned the police
just as soon as we heard the racket.

731
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,331
Thank you.

732
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:04,242
Sue Ellen, you know better than that.

733
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:08,113
You're not supposed to touch anything
until the police get here.

734
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,584
- The sword cane.
- Broken. Half of it's gone.

735
01:10:10,756 --> 01:10:13,247
We've got to find her. Come on.

736
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:05,699
She never lied to us.

737
01:12:37,369 --> 01:12:39,360
