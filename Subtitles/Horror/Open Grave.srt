- Jonah.

1068
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,170
Give me your arm.

1069
01:32:04,171 --> 01:32:06,174
Come on.
We're just gonna hide.

1070
01:32:09,171 --> 01:32:11,137
And we'll pretend we're dead.

1071
01:32:11,138 --> 01:32:12,507
We're gonna wake up, okay?

1072
01:32:15,504 --> 01:32:16,543
Oh, Jonah, listen to me...

1073
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:23,069
What's this?

1074
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,229
You have to read this, Jonah.

1075
01:32:26,203 --> 01:32:29,068
You can't forget. Please.

1076
01:32:29,069 --> 01:32:31,034
This time,
you have to do it right.

1077
01:32:31,035 --> 01:32:33,135
Please. For me.

1078
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:34,335
You better stay with me.

1079
01:32:34,336 --> 01:32:36,404
Listen to me, okay?
You are Jonah.

1080
01:32:37,403 --> 01:32:40,103
Don't forget, please.

1081
01:32:41,102 --> 01:32:41,901
I love you.

1082
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:44,521
I'll never forget you again.

1083
01:32:47,503 --> 01:32:49,467
I love you. You just
get some sleep, okay?

1084
01:32:49,468 --> 01:32:50,267
Just go with me.

1085
01:32:51,236 --> 01:32:52,471
I'm scared.

1086
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:57,167
- I don't wanna die.
- You won't die.

1087
01:32:57,168 --> 01:32:59,205
You won't die. Come on, sweetie.
I won't forget you.

1088
01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:01,543
You feel this?

1089
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:11,532
<i>My name is Jonah.</i>

1090
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:15,275
<i>My name is Jonah.</i>

1091
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:58,151
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

1092
01:34:42,028 --> 01:34:43,363
<i>SHARON: My love,</i>

1093
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,359
<i>I remembered everything.</i>

1094
01:34:51,261 --> 01:34:54,226
<i>We were doctors on the
verge of finding a cure</i>

1095
01:34:54,227 --> 01:34:57,932
<i>for an awful plague that has
cast the world into darkness.</i>

1096
01:35:03,926 --> 01:35:06,531
(ECHOING) Help me!
Please help me!

1097
01:35:11,526 --> 01:35:15,025
<i>SHARON: The mute woman
is the answer.</i>

1098
01:35:15,026 --> 01:35:16,493
<i>He blood is immune to the virus.</i>

1099
01:35:17,492 --> 01:35:19,067
<i>You must protect her.</i>

1100
01:35:27,058 --> 01:35:29,261
<i>You will find death
and madness everywhere.</i>

1101
01:35:32,258 --> 01:35:34,832
<i>But you'll have to fight
to finish what we started.</i>

1102
01:35:42,823 --> 01:35:44,526
<i>We have no time, Jonah.</i>

1103
01:35:46,523 --> 01:35:48,529
<i>There are still people
waiting to be saved.</i>

1104
01:35:53,524 --> 01:35:55,193
<i>I know your memory
will come back soon.</i>

1105
01:35:58,190 --> 01:35:59,924
<i>When it does,</i>

1106
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,880
<i>remember I love you.</i>
