- We should go after them.

00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:07,281

They're food.

You know, Rick brought in
a lot of them, too.

bringing that deer back yesterday.

It was a real treat, sir.

And I'd be honored
to shake your hand.

to spare a lot of people
for the run.

66
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,428
That place is good to go.
We're gonna move on it.

67

Yeah.

68
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:24,051

72
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:34,094
With more of us sitting here,
we're drawing more of them out.

73
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:37,030
You get enough of those damn
fence-clingers, they start to herd up.

74

<i>Pushing against</i>
<i>the fences again.</i>

75
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,336
It's manageable, but unless we
get ahead of it, not for long.

76
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:44,271
Sorry, Pookie.

you should go today.

Really?

83
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:37,157
Yeah.

85
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,349
Yeah, but you don't have to go.

86
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,167
You shouldn't.

87
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,773
You know everything's
gonna work out, right?

88
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,509
Right?

89
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,512
Right.

90
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,182
Right.

91
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,369

Hey yourself.

- You need an apron.
- Yeah.

00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,884
Listen, can we talk?

97
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,308
I was thinking of going
on the run today.

98
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,943
Okay.

99
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,946
I don't like killing
them on the fence.

100
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,881
I hate it.

101
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,050
I mean, when they're
coming at you out there,

102
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,685
it's different.

103
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,520
You don't even think about it.

104
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,223
When they're stacked up
against the chain-link,

105
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:46,226
you're just face-to-face.

106
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,095
I...

107
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:53,033
I just wanted to do something
different to help out.

108
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:57,938
You always volunteered to do it.

109
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,090
That's because you
were always doing it.

110
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:02,409
( laughs )

111
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,045
Just thought I could
get to know you.

112
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:12,219
You did.

113
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:16,940
You be careful out there.

114
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:29,569
Hey.

115
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,538
I was just gonna come find you.

116
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,660
- Hi.
- What's up?

117
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:39,963
Well, the council pulled back
everyone on the coal crew

118
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:41,915
from going on the run.

119
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,717
They're shorthanded right now.

120
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:45,836
I figured I'd step up
to help, go with 'em.

121
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,190
Just, you know, wanted to make
sure that I saw you before.

122
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,009
Okay.

123
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,561
I just--
'cause, you know,

124
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:56,930
it's dangerous going out there.

125
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,182
I know.
( kisses )

126
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,904
Okay, are you
gonna say good-bye?

127
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:05,489
Nope.

128
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,657
It's like a damn romance novel.

129
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,368

00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,370

my weight around here.

when Daryl found you. - That's right.

You know he was
a medic in the Army.

139
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,846
You a hell of a tough sell.
You know that?

140
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,350
Okay.

( engines start )

142
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,389
These leaves are gonna
be in the shade,

143
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,326
so we won't get
any good fruit from it.

144
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,362
So we just pinch it off here.

145
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:07,367
Things break,
but they can still grow.

146
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:10,420
These little bristles,
they'll take root

147
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,589
and we'll have
a whole new plant.

Awesome!
Thank you.

70 miles of walkers.

I don't want to lose whatever
we catch to the walkers.

00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,220
- Going to check the snares?
- I am.

183
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,906
You're not.
Do your chores.

184
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:29,342
Read comics.
Maybe some books, too.

185
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,778
Hang out with Patrick.

186
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,813
Maybe go to story time.

187
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:35,949
Dad, that's for kids.

188
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,684
Yeah.

189
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,187
Now brush her down.

190
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:52,432
Nothing wrong with
staying close, Rick.

191
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,901
Everyone understands.

192
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,603
You're growing us enough food

193
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,872
so we won't need
to do runs soon.

194
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:02,175
But we do have to find you
a good pair of overalls.

195
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,561
You need to look the part.

196
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,896
A little piece of wheat out
of the corner of your mouth.

197
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:08,381
Maybe a bigger ass.

198
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,234
( laughs )
Yeah.

199
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:14,888
Listen, the rest
of the council--

200
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,724
Daryl, Glenn, Carol, Sasha,

201
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:20,994
all of them--

202
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,296
they wanted me to talk to you.

203
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:26,066
When you go out there,

204
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,268
you got to take your gun.

205
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,004
- ( horse snorts )
- Easy now.

206
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,373
It's just outside the fence.

207
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,508
I have my knife.

208
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:38,211
I get in trouble, six bullets
isn't gonna make the difference.

209
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:41,915
Rick, we want you to be safe.

210
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,585
Bring your gun.

211
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:54,928
( flies buzzing )

212
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,710
( grunting )

213
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:19,819
<i>( rustling )</i>

214
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,730
Wait.

215
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:34,768
Please.

216
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:42,475
Please?

217
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,749
Please help me.

218
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,906
I know you don't know me.

219
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,875
Okay, I know that.

220
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:01,579
But can you please help me
get this to my husband?

221
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:05,950
We haven't eaten in days.

222
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,075
Here.
Go ahead.

223
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,485
Thank you.

224
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,847
Do you have a camp around here?

225
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,301
Yeah.

226
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,073
Could we possibly
come back with you?

227
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:06,577
We've been doing...

228
00:16:06,578 --> 00:16:09,146
very badly on our own.

229
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:19,540
I'd have to meet him.

230
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,361
I need to ask him some
questions, both of you.

231
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,165
What questions?

232
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,834
Just three.

233
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,802
When we get there.

234
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,140
You have a gun on you?

235
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,310
Can I make sure?

236
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,103
Yeah.

237
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,524
Look, I don't know you,

238
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,560
so I'm just gonna
tell you this.

239
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,947
You try anything--

240
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,301
anything--

241
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:08,272
you're gonna be
the one who loses.

242
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,577
I don't have
anything else to lose.

243
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,681
No.

244
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,933
You do.

245
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:24,805
Go ahead.

246
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,150
( growling )

247
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,069
Child:
<i>Nick, look over here.</i>

248
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,204
Child #2:
<i>This one's Wayne.</i>

249
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,439
- Nick.
- Nick, over here.

250
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,773
Hi, Nick!

251
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,992
- Hi, Nick.
- Carl: You're naming them?

252
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:47,378
Well, one of them
has a name tag,

253
00:17:47,379 --> 00:17:50,181
so we thought
all of them should.

254
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,717
They had names when they were alive.
They're dead now.

255
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:55,186
No, they're not.
They're just different.

256
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:56,671
What the hell
are you talking about?

257
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,789
Okay, they don't talk.

258
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,759
They don't think.
They eat people.

259
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,260
They kill people.

260
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,363
People kill people.
They still have names.

261
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,298
Have you seen what happens?

262
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,500
Have you seen someone
die like that?

263
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:13,304
Yeah, I have.

264
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,507
They're not people
and they're not pets.

265
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,809
Don't name them.

266
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,246
We're supposed to go read.
Come on.

267
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:29,053
You coming to
story time tonight?

268
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:32,123
Uh, yeah.

269
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,341
See you then.

270
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:39,180
I go sometimes.
I'm immature.

271
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:41,716
You wouldn't dig it.
It's for kids.

272
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:45,469
I'm gonna head up there, too.

273
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,388
I'll catch you later,
young sir.

274
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:49,339
Yep.

275
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,475
Army came in
and put these fences up.

276
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,477
Made it a place
for the people to go.

277
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,613
Last week when we
spotted this place,

278
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:58,149
there was a bunch of walkers
behind this chain-link

279
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,485
keeping people out
like a bunch of guard dogs.

280
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:03,020
<i>( music blaring over radio )</i>

281
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:04,622
So they all just left?

282
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,524
Give a listen.

283
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,542
( music continues playing )

284
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:10,461
You drew 'em out.

285
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:12,296
Put a boom box out there
three days ago.

286
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,498
Hooked it up
to two car batteries.

287
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:17,468
All right, let's make a sweep.

288
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:19,670
Make sure it's safe.
Grab what you can.

289
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:21,205
We'll come back tomorrow
with more people.

290
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:39,323
Come on.

291
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:47,081
( pounding )

292
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:49,200
Just give it a second.

293
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,571
Okay, I think I got it.

294
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:57,842
Got what?

295
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:01,345
I've been trying to guess what
Daryl did before the turn.

296
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,431
He's been trying to guess
for, like, six weeks.

297
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,415
Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

298
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,384
One shot a day.

299
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:09,386
All right, shoot.

300
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:14,775
Well, the way you are
at the prison,

301
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,611
you being on the council,
you're able to track,

302
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,815
you're helping people, but
you're still being kind of...

303
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:23,267
surly.

304
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,487
Big swing here.

305
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,957
Homicide cop.

306
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,625
( laughing )

307
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:34,245
What's so funny?

308
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,381
Nothing.
It makes perfect sense.

309
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:39,616
Actually, the man's right.

310
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,502
Undercover.

311
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,622
- Come on, really?
- Yep.

312
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,391
I don't like to talk about it

313
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:50,427
'cause it was a lot
of heavy shit, you know?

314
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,266
Dude, come on, really?

315
00:20:57,969 --> 00:20:59,236
( clears throat )

316
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,872
Okay. I'll just keep
guessing, I guess.

317
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:03,607
- Yeah, you keep doing that.
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:05,642
( snarling )

319
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,978
- We're gonna do this, Detective?
- Let's do it.

320
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:10,981
<i>( doors open )</i>

321
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:16,754
All right, we go in, stay
in formation for the sweep.

322
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,622
After that, you all know what
you're supposed to look for.

323
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:20,207
Any questions?

324
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,126
Was there ever a time that
you weren't the boss of me?

325
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,627
You had a few years
before I was born.

326
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,567
( growling )

327
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:03,203
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

328
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:06,540
We were going
to Puerto Vallarta

329
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,675
for our honeymoon.

330
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:11,612
When they shut down
the airports,

331
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:14,514
our connecting flight
never connected.

332
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,752
They wouldn't let us
leave the terminal, so...

333
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,523
we slept next to these huge

334
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,593
marble sculptures
from Zimbabwe.

335
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:31,298
Then, on the fourth night,

336
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,801
the things just came through.

337
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,054
There were a lot of us and...

338
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:40,807
now it's just Eddie and me.

339
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,511
And I wouldn't have made it

340
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,596
if it wasn't for him.

341
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:49,883
And it isn't that...

342
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:56,823
he saved me over and over again

343
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,443
or that he showed me the things

344
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,663
that I had to do or...

345
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,698
to be willing to do.

346
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:09,503
If he wasn't still here...

347
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,706
I-- I couldn't be.

348
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,910
I just-- I couldn't.

349
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:20,130
What were they?

350
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,682
What?

351
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:26,253
The things you had
to be willing to do?

352
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,088
Um...

353
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:31,441
eating whatever
we could find--

354
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,760
animal carcasses

355
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,763
and rotten fruit-- and...

356
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,617
<i>leaving people behind.</i>

357
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:46,289
Hiding from people
who needed my help.

00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,327
Unlike you.

359
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,167
This is not charity.

360
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:59,219
You have to have numbers.

361
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,055
People are the best
defense against walkers

362
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:04,174
or people.

363
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,959
We help each other.

364
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,563
You call them "walkers"?

365
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,611
( yelling )

366
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,863
( growling )

367
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,578
You all right?
You cut or something?

368
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,747
No, man, but my foot is caught.

369
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:10,600
All right. He's just caught.
Come on, help me up.

370
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:13,303
<i>- What happened? - Everyone's all right.</i>
<i>We're over in wine and beer.</i>

371
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:20,443
( roof creaking )

372
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:23,596
I was moving fast, man.
I drove right into the drinks.

373
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:26,800
Man, you lucked out. If this thing had
come down on you the wrong way...

374
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:39,913
( snarling )

375
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:42,115
Yeah, uh, we should
probably go now.

376
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:43,833
Bob's still stuck.
Get him out of there.

377
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,502
We'll get the others.

378
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,521
Hey!

379
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:15,281
I saw those sculptures
at the airport once.

380
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:18,218
My favorite was the kids
playing leapfrog.

381
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,188
Mine, too.

382
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,093
What Eddie and I had to do,

383
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:29,646
did you do things like that?

384
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,901
Did you?

385
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:41,241
Do you think you get
to come back from them?

386
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,746
I hope so.

387
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,448
Yeah?

388
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:51,284
I hope we answer
your three questions

389
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,286
to your satisfaction.

390
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:56,823
( growling )

391
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,806
( grunting )

392
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:15,892
( snarling )

393
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:24,067
( grunting )

394
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:43,503
( machine-gun gunfire )

395
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,305
( clicks )

396
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:06,242
Hey!

397
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,328
( growling )

398
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,248
Hey!

399
00:29:40,227 --> 00:29:41,311
Daryl, go!

400
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:57,627
( gunfire )

401
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,662
Let's get Bob.

402
00:30:06,954 --> 00:30:08,338
- ( grunting )
- Bob: More, more.

403
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,340
Come on, time to go.

404
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,959
Let's go, now!
Come on! Go!

405
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,061
- <i>Let's get out of here!</i>
<i>- Ah!</i>

406
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:17,797
( shouting )

407
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,986
( screaming )

408
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,355
- Zack!
- ( screaming )

409
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,859
Go, go!

410
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,446
Come on!

411
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:40,870
It's just ahead.

412
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,008
Eddie.

413
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,128
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

414
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:50,797
This is Rick.

415
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,016
<i>He's gonna help us.</i>

416
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,104
Everything's gonna be okay.

417
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:01,340
Everything--
( breathing heavily )

418
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,080
- <i>( blade scrapes )</i>
<i>- ( shouting )</i>

419
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,400
Damn it!

420
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,518
<i>( sobbing )</i>

421
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,657
I wanted to take the boar.

422
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,361
I just knew-- I knew I'd get
you here so much quicker.

423
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,798
He's starving.

424
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,002
He's slowing.
He needs something alive.

425
00:31:34,441 --> 00:31:38,011
Please, I told you,
I can't be without him.

426
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,049
And so I kept him.

427
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,384
It was wrong.

428
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:48,271
( breathing heavily )

429
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,823
I can't do things like this.

430
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:55,561
And-- and you have to do
things like this.

431
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,780
<i>Let me be like him.</i>

432
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,333
Don't stop it.

433
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,452
Don't end it after.

434
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,921
- No.
- Let me be with him.

435
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:07,623
No!

436
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,293
( groans )

437
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,628
( gasping )

438
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,468
( groans )

439
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:32,899
Hey.

440
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,411
What were...

441
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:47,580
the questions?

442
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,118
The three questions?

443
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:56,556
How many walkers
have you killed?

444
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,797
Eddie--

445
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,016
Eddie killed--
killed them all.

446
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,903
Until...
( gasping )

447
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,527
How many people
have you killed?

448
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,667
Just me.

449
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,419
Just me.

450
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,423
Why?

451
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:37,830
<i>( gasping )</i>

452
00:33:42,502 --> 00:33:44,170
You don't--

453
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,722
you don't get to come back.

454
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,644
You don't get to come back

455
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:54,397
from things.

456
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,482
You don't...

457
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:58,517
( gasping )

458
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:28,431
( growling )

459
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:41,325
"The children fastened their eyes
upon their bit of candle

460
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:45,395
and watched it melt
slowly and pitilessly away.

461
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:49,266
Saw the half inch of wick
stand alone at last.

462
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,002
Saw the feeble flame
rise and fall.

463
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:55,555
Climb the thin tower of smoke.

464
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:59,142
Linger at its top
a moment and then..."

465
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,183
Ma'am, should I take watch now?

466
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:09,369
Yes, Luke, you do that.

467
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,905
Today...

468
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:15,025
we are talking about knives--
how to use them,

469
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:17,628
how to be safe with them, and
how they could save your life.

470
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,079
Patrick: <i>Ma'am,</i>
<i>may I be dismissed?</i>

471
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,366
- What is it?
- I'm not feeling very well.

472
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,635
Sometimes you're gonna
have to fight through it.

473
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,870
What if you wind up
out there alone?

474
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:29,723
You just give up
because you're feeling bad?

475
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:34,444
No, it's just I don't want
to yack on somebody.

476
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,148
Go.

477
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,938
Okay, today we're gonna
learn how to hold a knife,

478
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:49,726
how to stab and slash
and where to aim for.

479
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:57,951
Please, don't tell your father.

480
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:08,945
( growling )

481
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,302
( growling )

482
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,684
What?

483
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:08,188
I don't like going
out there, either.

484
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:19,983
( sighs )
Daryl's telling Beth.

485
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,152
There's nothing else to do.

486
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:25,455
I'll go see her.

487
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,011
I'm not pregnant.

488
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:33,213
- You know?
- I know.

489
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,834
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

490
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,853
Oh, my God.

491
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:43,673
I didn't want to,
but we could have.

492
00:37:45,676 --> 00:37:47,177
We can have lives here.

493
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:51,448
How can you say that
after today?

494
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:53,150
After Lori?

495
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:56,186
Because I don't want to be
afraid of being alive.

496
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,193
Being afraid
is what's kept us alive.

497
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,796
No.

498
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,798
It's how we kept breathing.

499
00:38:15,256 --> 00:38:16,807
Hey.

500
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:18,758
Hi.

501
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,263
What is it?

502
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:25,182
( sighs )

503
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,150
Zack.

504
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:33,723
Is he dead?

505
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,167
Okay.

506
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:05,889
What?

507
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:13,864
I don't cry anymore, Daryl.

508
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:19,119
I'm just glad I got
to know him, you know?

509
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,154
Me, too.

510
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,441
Are you okay?

511
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:30,213
Just tired of losing
people is all.

512
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,256
I'm glad I didn't
say good-bye.

513
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:42,008
I hate good-byes.

514
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,930
Me, too.

515
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,166
You tried to help her.

516
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:09,085
You couldn't.
No one could.

517
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,988
Some people are too far gone.

518
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,990
You're not.

519
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,792
You tried to help her.

520
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,928
How that woman wound up,

521
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,046
I got close to that.

522
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:24,017
If I lost Carl and Judith,

523
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:25,501
if I lost this place--

524
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:28,355
Not then, Rick.
Not even then.

525
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,842
You came back.

526
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,894
Your boy came back.

527
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,698
You get to come back.
You do.

528
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:50,193
