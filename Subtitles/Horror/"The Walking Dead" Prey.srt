No!

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,867
I want Michonne.

7
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:16,109
Turn her over and
this all goes away.

8
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:17,524
What about the deal?

9
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,567
We'll have to eliminate
Rick sooner or later.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,491
Whatever we've go to
do to earn our keep.

11
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:23,710
We're in.

12
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:25,218
Rick and I set terms.

13
00:00:25,363 --> 00:00:26,601
What sort of terms?

14
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:28,522
We're going to war.

where did you find them?

25
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:52,472
Did they attack?
Did you hunt them down?

00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,925
Or did you know them?

27
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,684
I'm so sorry.

00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:06,352
Oh God.

00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:12,975
You want to talk about it?

They weren't human

00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:27,803
The Governor wants all this?

40
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:29,838
- He wants options.
- Where is he now?

42
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:34,509

- Everybody.

I thought there was
a deal on the table.

44

I'm sure it's just a
precaution, a show of force.

00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:29,414
Milton!

You need something?

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,458
What is that?

00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,710
It's my workshop.

00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,879
How does that help Woodbury?

51
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,466
Excuse me?

52
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,885
This was supposed
to be a new start,

53
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,803
a way out.

54
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,588
What about everything
we talked about?

55
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,424
Beating this thing?
Clawing our way back?

56
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,261
Look, this business
with Michonne,

57
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,947
I understand.

58
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:03,899
But the people at the prison...

59
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,434
What?

60
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:07,953
Hmm?

61
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:10,438
- I should move on?
- Yes.

62
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,157
Well, I will
as soon as this is over.

63
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:14,793
- Philip--
- <i>Let me ask you something, huh?</i>

64
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:18,463
Do you still believe the biters
have some spark in them, huh?

65
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,298
Of who they were?

66
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,800
I think so.

67
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,503
Then that was
my daughter, wasn't it?

68
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:28,006
Whether that was Penny or not,

69
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,175
it's done.

70
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,128
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh...

71
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,133
it's all that matters.

72
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,659
There is no deal.
Philip's asked for Michonne.

73
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,144
Rick would never agree to that.

74
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:51,947
Whether he hands
her over or not,

75
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:54,482
he's gonna kill them all.

76
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:57,318
- I have to stop this.
- I don't think you can.

77
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,873
Leave.

78
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:37,659
Tell the people at the prison
to get out of there.

79
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,911
In time, he'll move on.

80
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,546
No.

81
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,001
I have to kill him.

82
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,702
You'll never get close to him.

83
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:49,754
They'll gun you down first.

84
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:52,390
Only if they see me coming.

85
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,542

86
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:57,228

95

He doesn't give a shit
about you.

96
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:23,848
I knew Philip before
he became the Governor.

97
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,100
That man still exists.

98
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,068
I don't believe that.

99
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,270
Okay, so you kill the Governor.

100
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:31,940
Then you get shot
and Martinez takes over.

101
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,275
What then?

102
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:36,995
Killing the Governor
doesn't save your friends.

103
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,084

Warn them.

104

And you're coming with me.

105
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:46,671
I can't leave Woodbury.

106
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:48,673
You really want
to be a part of this?

107
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,491
I don't know anyone
at the prison.

108
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:53,661
So what? You know Merle.
He fit in.

109
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,496
You'll be fine.

110
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,217
Like it or not, I belong here.

111
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:03,555
Then if you stay,

112
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:06,441
you can't keep looking
the other way.

113
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,781
Take care of yourself.

114
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,029

- Sasha: <i>Why can't you handle it?</i>

You're supposed
to be a good shot.

00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,912
- What are you doing?
- Got to get out of here.

- What is this about?
- Just get out of my way.

- Don't.
- Relax.

164

Nobody's got to get hurt here.

165
00:13:26,258 --> 00:13:28,509
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, it's just
this place is--

00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:34,849
- I can't stay here.
- Why?

168
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,518
The Governor, he is not
what he seems to be.

169
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,887
- He seems pretty straight up to me.
- That's what I thought, too.

170

But I'm telling you,
he has done terrible things.

00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,739
not keep people in.

184
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,858
This isn't
a prison camp, is it?

185
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:45,228
Of course not. It's just she's in
no shape to take care of herself.

186
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,397
Seems pretty capable to me.

187
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,451
She was out there all winter

188
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:53,920
alone.

189
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,041
Can you imagine?

190
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,913
Now, you two had each other
or your friends.

191
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:06,516
She only had the biters.

192
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,937
We brought her in
and tried to help her,

193
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:12,439
but it was too late.

194
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,975
She'd been out there too long.

195
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:20,230
Did she--
did she say anything?

196
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:25,902
- Like what?
- I don't know.

197
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:27,571
Like what panicked her?

198
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,792
No.

199
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:36,129
I hope this doesn't affect us.

200
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,783
What do you mean?

201
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:43,953
Well, we heard she was
with that prison group.

202
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:46,807
I hope I didn't
complicate things.

203
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:48,925
No. No.

204
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,761
Um, look, I'll tell you what.

205
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,964
Martinez here could use
a hand with something.

206
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,133
If you wouldn't mind helping
him out, I'd appreciate it.

207
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:59,486
- Of course.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

208
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:07,277
<i>( door opens )</i>

209
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,667
Is she gone?

210
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,504
They going after her?

211
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,155
No.

212
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,157
I am.

213
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,928
Oh.

214
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:26,630
You have a problem
with that, too?

215
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,351
Let her go.

216
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,720
Why would I do that?

217
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,672
She just wants
to be with her people.

218
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,677
You talked to her?

219
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:42,812
No.

220
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,199
You did.

221
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,851
You knew she was leaving,
didn't you?

222
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:50,871
She told me.

223
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:54,824
What else did you two
talk about, huh?

224
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,743
Did you tell her
about the deal?

225
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:01,548
Did you tell her
about Michonne?

226
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,921
She knows, doesn't she?

227
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:18,881
( panting )

228
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:21,351
( walkers growling )

229
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:31,912
Hey.

230
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:34,080
Be ready to roll in a few.

231
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:36,283
Where to?

232
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,451
We're not going
after that girl, are we?

233
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,453
What if we were?
Is that a problem?

234
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,422
She was pretty shook up.

235
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,124
She definitely
didn't want to be here.

236
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,410
Look, she's on her own,
understood?

237
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:49,746
We got something else.

238
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,548
It's sort of hard to explain.

239
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,883
Just be at the truck in five.

240
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,419
- Okay.
- What girl?

241
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,271
Andrea jumped the wall.

242
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:01,057
On your watch?
And you let her go?

243
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,760
Hey, man, these guys
have been talking.

244
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:05,261
She's trouble.

245
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:07,063
Maybe she's not the issue.

246
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:11,651
She said some
pretty crazy shit.

247
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,955
You know why?
'Cause she's crazy.

248
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:17,607
Hey, don't screw this
up for us.

249
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,410
- I'm just looking out.
- For you two, maybe.

250
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,629
What the hell
are you talking about?

251
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,464
We got a good thing here.

252
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,967
I don't want to get
tossed out because of you.

253
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:31,504
These guys are on edge.

254
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:34,140
They've been attacked by that crazy-ass
cowboy and some chick with a sword.

255
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,925
Shit's going down
and you're making waves.

256
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,978
We just have to get
with the program.

257
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:40,313
I am.

258
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,599
That guy doesn't trust you.

259
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,684
Do not screw this up.

260
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,969
Ease back, man.

261
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:50,156
Or what?

262
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:52,993
You need to shame me
in front of my boy again?

263
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,645
Don't go there, man.

264
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:58,198
Donna...

265
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:00,617
I just happened to be there.

266
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:03,203
- It could have been anyone.
- But it wasn't, was it?

267
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:06,189
- It was you.
- You want to do this now?

268
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,825
A long time coming.

269
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,344
You guys catch up.

270
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,129
Come on, Ben.

271
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,669
Yeah, it was me.
I saved her life.

272
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,721
Right place, right time.

273
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,357
And from that moment, she was
glued to you like a lost puppy.

274
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:27,110
Her knight in shining armor.

275
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,145
It made me feel like...

276
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,483
- I could have done it.
- I know you could've.

277
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,285
- She didn't.
- Of course she did.

278
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:38,688
She knew that.
She was just scared, that's all.

279
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,710
This ain't got nothing
to do with you or me.

280
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:47,029
Yo, I said five.

281
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,031
Let's go.
Fire it up.

282
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,667
We ain't done.

283
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,836

What is that?

Martinez:
Jackpot, baby.

294
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,150
This some kind
of extermination?

295
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:32,802
You could say that.
No weeding out today, Shump.

296
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:34,988
- The more the merrier.
- All right.

297
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,307
You got a use for them?

298
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:38,775
Honey, we got a use
for everything.

299
00:21:43,147 --> 00:21:46,616
This got something to do with that meeting
tomorrow? The one with the prison group?

300
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:50,253
Ho, ho, ho.
Get that man a prize.

301
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:53,090
- You're bringing biters?
- Allen, heads up.

302
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:54,875
Okay, this is genius.

303
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:57,827
Hey, kid, grab the collars
out of the truck.

304
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:59,829
This ain't right.

305
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,548
Didn't think we were gonna
have any problems today, fella.

306
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,350
I didn't think we'd be
feeding people to biters.

307
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:06,169
What do you care?
They're rats.

308
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,055
This is sick.

309
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,974
Hey, give me a hand here.
Ty, you deaf?

310
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,176
I'm not doing this.

311
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,178
They got women and children.

312
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,646
You can't do this.

313
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,014
Fine, suit yourself.

314
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,983
We get back,
you tell the Governor.

315
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:22,369
He'll send you packing.
Send you all packing.

316
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,038
- There's no need for that. Damn it.
- Relax.

317
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,908
We looked out for each other.
We'll do it again.

318
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:30,794
We'll get out of your way
if that's what you want.

319
00:22:30,795 --> 00:22:34,047
You don't speak for us.
You're not sending my boy out there again.

320
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:37,551
- I look out for him.
- Like you looked out for Donna?

Yeah.

Did you find her?

390
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,935
No luck.

391
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,320
Just got word. Someone
barbecued the pit biters.

392
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,939
Who?

393
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,024
Got a few shit stirrers
in the bunch.

394
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:19,892
Tyreese and his sister.

395
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:22,228
Send them over to distro.

396
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:24,364
- Rest of the group, too.
- All right.

397
00:38:24,365 --> 00:38:26,783
We're still gonna need biters,
so get some more.

398
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,901
Right. You got it.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

401
00:38:39,763 --> 00:38:41,247
Did you find her?

402
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:43,749
No.

403
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,302
Hardly made it back myself.

404
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:50,589
I'll look again tomorrow.

405
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:56,062
So I heard there was
a little hang-up at the pits.

406
00:38:56,063 --> 00:38:58,564
You got a beef with Rick,
that's fair enough.

407
00:38:58,565 --> 00:39:01,617
But you can't be feeding
his kids to biters.

408
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,602
No one's feeding anyone
to biters.

409
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:07,073
Well, I saw the trailers.

410
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:10,460
It's a scare tactic.
It's a bluff.

411
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:13,830
I'd rather scare his people
into leaving us alone

412
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:16,299
than engaging in another fight.

413
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,501
I'm trying to save lives here.

414
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,805
They're just for show?

415
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:25,458
You know, people are more
afraid of a biter on a leash

416
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:27,460
than a gun in their face.

417
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,963
It's pretty effective.

418
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,685
Then why didn't your man
just say that?

419
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,572
'Cause...

420
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:41,607
we don't discuss
tactics with people

421
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:43,976
that we don't really know.

422
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:59,158
( sighs ) Governor, look.

423
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,377
I shoot my mouth off sometimes,

424
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:04,047
but the truth is
we want to stay.

425
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,135
I saw red.
It won't happen again.

426
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,689
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

427
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:28,071
Where did you get the gasoline?

428
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:31,741
Come again?

429
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:38,915
Doesn't matter.

430
00:40:59,886 --> 00:41:02,221
Is she dead?

431
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:04,440
I hope not.

432
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:08,578
Are you okay?

433
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,164
Never been better.

434
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:17,286
It's a real shame
about the pits.

435
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,091
You heard about that, huh?

436
00:41:22,092 --> 00:41:24,927
I hope you find out who did it.

437
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,548
Already have.
