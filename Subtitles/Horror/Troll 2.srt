1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,314
<i>(man) Peter was a courageous boy,</i>

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,152
<i>but that dawn he could feel fear</i>
<i>stick to his skin like dew on leaves.</i>

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,398
<i>The fog was thick enough</i>
<i>to make him lose his way home.</i>

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,958
<i>Then he began to hear strange noises</i>
<i>coming from the depths of the forest.</i>

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,036
<i>He noticed a presence,</i>

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,473
<i>small shadows that seemed to giggle</i>
<i>as they followed in his footsteps.</i>

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,958
- <i>(boy) Who were they, Grandpa?</i>
- <i>Cruel, deformed forest dwellers,</i>

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,516
<i>haughty creatures,</i>
<i>spiteful and impudent.</i>

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,996
<i>They are the vengeful and evil goblins</i> -

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,759
<i>the little people of the night.</i>

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,079
What did they want with him?
What did Peter do to the goblins?

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,320
That's the point. Goblins don't
need to justify their cruel acts.

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,670
They are evil creatures.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,075
But let me go on, please.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,839
OK. I won't interrupt you any more.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,428
To make a long story short,

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,836
Peter started to run and run

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,235
<i>and run.</i>

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,274
<i>(grunting and grumbling)</i>

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,112
Poor Peter remained on the ground
unconscious for a long time.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,754
Finally, when he opened his eyes,

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,158
he saw in front of him,
just a few inches away from him...

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,590
A goblin?

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,676
<i>She was a lovely girl</i>

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,349
<i>with huge eyes the colour of the sea.</i>

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,598
<i>She looked at him kindly,</i>
<i>her expression full of love.</i>

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,757
<i>Peter immediately fell in love with her.</i>

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,795
<i>She caressed him and offered him</i>
<i>something to eat and drink.</i>

29
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,550
<i>The strange concoction</i>
<i>she offered him was delicious.</i>

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,357
<i>Peter ate and drank</i>
<i>without ever taking his eyes off her.</i>

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,756
<i>He was bewitched by that gaze,</i>

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,998
<i>and it was that look that deceived him.</i>

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
I bet it was a goblin in disguise.

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,232
Those evil creatures can transform
themselves into flesh and blood people,

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,432
whenever and however they want.

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,752
You're making a mistake, Grandpa.
You said they <i>can.</i>

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,839
You should have said they <i>could,</i>
or what kind of fairy tale is it?

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,633
They <i>can.</i> They <i>can.</i>

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,320
Goblins still exist.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,273
Your Grandpa Seth is telling you.

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,314
And... how did Peter end up?

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,752
<i>He began to feel ill, very ill.</i>

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,953
<i>He was sweating chlorophyll green.</i>

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,913
- <i>(boy) Green?</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

45
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,635
<i>The colour of the goblins.</i>
<i>The colour of sap.</i>

46
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,958
<i>Then she appeared to him</i>
<i>as she really was</i> -

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,152
<i>horrible and mocking.</i>

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,191
Changed into what?

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,073
Half man, half plant.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,078
The goblins' favourite food.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,034
Food? Don't tell me
they ate him, Grandpa!

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,833
That's exactly what happened,

53
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,238
with a voracity
that has no equal on Earth.

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,393
What are you doing still up, Josh?

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,432
Grandpa Seth was telling me a sto...

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,671
<i>(sighs)</i>

57
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,548
Still telling the same story, Josh?

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,911
I know, Mommy. I told you
it would never happen again.

59
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,476
But, you see, it's not a dream for me.

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,388
I see him in front of me
and he's so real.

61
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,795
He tells me stories, just like before.

62
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,789
Grandpa Seth has been gone for over
six months now. You were at the funeral.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,275
I know it was very difficult for you.

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,269
It was also very difficult for your
father, Holly and me, his daughter.

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,630
He was an amazing man.

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,718
Grandpa Seth has remained
in all our hearts,

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,991
but you must banish him
from your mind.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,759
- Remember what the doctor said?
- Of course.

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,475
Grandpa Seth is just an invention
of my subconscious.

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,239
That's right.

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,638
- But he's so real...
- That's enough. Try to go to sleep.

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,228
We're going on a vacation tomorrow.

73
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,514
A month in the country will do us
all good. Good night, dear.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,434
- Good night, dear.
- Mom?

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,115
- Yes?
- Do goblins exist?

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,475
No, dear. They don't exist.

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,875
Now, try to go to sleep.

78
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,230
<i>(man)</i> Yeah, John. That's Nilbog,
right. Spell it? N-l-L-B-O-G.

79
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,430
We'll be gone around a month.

80
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,916
Can you take care
of that business while we're gone?

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,235
Yeah? That's great. OK.

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,920
See ya, John. All right, bye.

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,478
- Are the kids sleeping?
- No. They're more awake than we are.

84
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,388
They're probably excited about the trip.

85
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,398
Do you know how many people
live in Nilbog?

86
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,274
- No. How many?
- 26, including the Presents.

87
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,358
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Come on to bed.

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,268
Just think, we'll be living like
our ancestors did.

89
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,868
Yeah, we'll be peasants and farmers,

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,390
just like people did a century ago.

91
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,149
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I'm worried about Joshua.

92
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,078
He's still seeing Grandpa Seth.

93
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,668
When I was a kid,
I had an imaginary playmate.

94
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
It wasn't your dead grandfather.

95
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,429
It'll end. This trip will make him
forget about your father.

96
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,590
- Michael?
- Yeah?

97
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,518
Who are the goblins?

98
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,030
The goblins? <i>(laughs)</i>

99
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
<i>(tapping)</i>

100
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,832
<i>(laughter)</i>

101
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,511
- Sh! You fell! What a jerk!
- He pointed the light right at me!

102
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,428
Goblins don't exist. Goblins
don't exist. Goblins don't exist.

103
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,033
<i>(screeches)</i>

104
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,155
Elliot!
What kind of idiotic joke is this?

105
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,475
You scared the shit out of me.

106
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,955
I'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture.

107
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,311
I have to release my lowest instincts
with a woman.

108
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,590
Release your instincts in the bathroom!

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,191
- Are you trying to turn me into a homo?
- It wouldn't be too hard.

110
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,233
If my father discovers you here,
he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them.

111
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,476
He can't stand you!

112
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,319
And... And you?

113
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,396
I like you.

114
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,476
But my family doesn't like you.

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,115
They say you spend
way too much time with your friends.

116
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,800
Oh, oh, but I swear I never see them.

117
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,311
- How long is this gonna take?
- We're sick of waiting.

118
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,159
Won't you come to Tonino's,
Holly, for some pizza?

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,350
Hey, these are cute!

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,436
<i>(all complain)</i>

121
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,757
- Do you see?
- What's wrong with having friends?

122
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,677
Nothing, if you wanna
remain a virgin for life.

123
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,679
You take them to bed with you,
and I don't believe in group sex.

124
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
Is your family
going on vacation tomorrow?

125
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,277
- Yes.
- I'll come with you?

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,994
OK, I'll tell my father
you're coming with us.

127
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,076
- Where are we going?
- Nilbog.

128
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,112
A wonderful half-empty town.
It's an exchange.

129
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,075
A family from the country is coming here
and we're going to live in their house.

130
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,317
Oh, Elliot, it will be wonderful.

131
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,193
You and me, in the woods.

132
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,676
This time, we'll be able
to be together for sure.

133
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,711
And my boys?

134
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,798
If you bring them,
I never wanna see you again.

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,038
OK. I'm going now and I'll tell them.
I'll see you tomorrow morning?

136
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,674
- At eight on the dot.
- OK.

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,155
- Elliot?
- Yeah.

138
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,236
- Alone?
- Of course.

139
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,920
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

140
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,195
Finally!

141
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,679
Please don't do this, Holly.

142
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,190
We could have waited
another 15 minutes.

143
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,959
I'm sure he would've come.

144
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,038
We left at 9.30,
an hour and a half off schedule.

145
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,869
- We never saw a sign of your beau.
- Elliot's not my beau.

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,877
He's my boyfriend.

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,468
He told me last night that he loves me

148
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
and that he wanted to come
with my family.

149
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,909
- Evidently he preferred his friends to you.
- That's not true.

150
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,510
Yes, it is. Listen to reason.
Elliot is a good-for-nothing.

151
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,392
Stop it, both of you.

152
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,958
I have no intention of having
my vacation ruined just for this.

153
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,829
I never liked that kid. I never did.

154
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,316
I'm the one who has to like him, Dad.
Me, alone.

155
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,396
Stop it, please!

156
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,672
Joshua, start singing. Come on.
Sing that song I like so much.

157
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,634
- I don't feel like singing, Mom.
- Just sing.

158
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,116
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

159
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,357
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream

160
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,995
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

161
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,192
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream

162
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,357
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream

163
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,069
Where the hell is Nilbog?
It's not even marked on the map.

164
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,273
It's gotta be there somewhere.
Just look closer, dudes.

165
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,039
Here it is, but it's just a speck.

166
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,836
- Sure it's full of beautiful girls?
- Lots of 'em. Pretty and unattached.

167
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,712
Oh, yeah!

168
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,398
Whoo!

169
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,472
I don't feel good.

170
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,918
Stop the car, Dad. I'm sick!

171
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,919
You stuffed yourself like a pig, Joshua!

172
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,912
I'd really love to see you get sick!

173
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,508
You ate too much.

174
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,195
Dad, stop the car.

175
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,788
Joshua's ready to be eaten!

176
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,512
<i>(growling)</i>

177
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,919
- No! Don't eat me!
- Joshua!

178
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,270
Was I dreaming?

179
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,755
Who wanted to eat you, little brother?

180
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,677
Nobody.

181
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,148
We're only a few miles away, Josh.

182
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,317
Speaking of eating,
do you want some, Joshua?

183
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,795
No, thanks.

184
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,597
- Stop the car, Daddy. Stop!
- What's wrong, Josh?

185
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,350
- Do you have to throw up?
- Yes. I have to throw up.

186
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,754
- What are you doing here, Grandpa?
- What are all of <i>you</i> doing here?

187
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,917
- You have to make them go back.
- Why?

188
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,077
You're getting yourselves into big trouble.

189
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,751
This is a bad place, little one.
It even gives me the creeps.

190
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,111
Can't you tell me more, Grandpa?

191
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,040
What are you doing, Joshua?

192
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,277
So how about it?
Are you gonna give me a ride or not?

193
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,154
Get in the car, Joshua. Come on! Hurry!

194
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,030
Come on! Get in!

195
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,713
Holly!

196
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,750
Come on! Holly! Quick!

197
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,758
- That was them, right?
- Yeah, right. She just...

198
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,634
- Why didn't Holly stop them?
- I don't think this was a good idea.

199
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,799
- Shut up! I'm in charge, not her.
- Yeah, says you!

200
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,434
- There's no one here.
- It's normal.

201
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,838
It's a farming community. At this
time of night everybody goes to sleep.

202
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,554
- Where's the farm?
- Over there.

203
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,878
Now, remember, we're the farmer Waits.
We're country people.

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,070
- Dad?
- What, Josh?

205
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,476
I don't like this place.
Can we go home?

206
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,273
- What?
- Don't listen to him.

207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,517
- Lead the way, Farmer Waits.
- OK.

208
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,476
Fresh air! Country air!

209
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,158
Hello.

210
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,876
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. We had a small mishap.

211
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,155
- Here are the keys.
- Um, here are ours.

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,430
Enjoy your stay in Nilbog.

213
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,516
Enjoy our city, too.

214
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,796
You'll enjoy our city.

215
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,514
It has some smog and it's a little noisy,

216
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,155
but our house
has all the major conveniences.

217
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,909
It's got a microwave and video.
All the other appliances.

218
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,238
- Yeah.
- A refrigerator, a bar.

219
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,909
People of few words.

220
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,235
Come on. Let's go in.

221
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,831
Joshua? You coming?

222
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,278
- Yeah, not bad!
- I'm hungry.

223
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,269
They've probably left something
behind, I'd be willing to bet.

224
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,314
Come take a look, everyone!

225
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,709
Typical country hospitality.

226
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,035
Let's dig in.

227
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,790
- <i>(father)</i> I am so hungry.
- <i>(mother)</i> Here, have some of this.

228
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,194
Here, try this. That looks good...

229
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,394
- Grandpa!
- Don't let them eat, Joshua.

230
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,479
For the love of God, don't let them eat!

231
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,240
Aren't you hungry, Joshua?

232
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,708
Most of this stuff is green.
How weird.

233
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,470
Stop them, Joshua.
You're the only one that can do it.

234
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,355
If they eat, they'll come to
the same end as Peter in the story.

235
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,869
But how can I stop them?

236
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,430
OK, you have 30 seconds
to come up with some way to stop them.

237
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,750
I must do it!

238
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,912
I must do it! I must do it!

239
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,916
No, Daddy! Please!

240
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,679
Don't hit him, Michael.
Please don't hit him!

241
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,352
Why not? It's what he deserves -
a big spanking for a little shit.

242
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,359
Joshua is not a little shit.
He's just very sensitive.

243
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,755
This smells!

244
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,435
Do you see this writing?

245
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,437
Do you know what it means?

246
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,395
Hospitality,
and you can't piss on hospitality.

247
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,035
- I won't allow it!
- What are you going to do, Daddy?

248
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,038
Tighten my belt
so I don't feel hunger pains.

249
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,469
Your sister and mother will do likewise.

250
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,716
OK, Joshua. You want to get rough?

251
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,152
You wanna show that you don't like
this house by going on hunger strike?

252
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,876
I'll accept the challenge, but when I was
your age I really did suffer from hunger.

253
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,754
We'll see who gets through this,
but I've got more practice.

254
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,314
I'll see you tomorrow.

255
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,833
<i>(explosions on television)</i>

256
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,397
I'm sick of this. Where are
the unattached horny girls, Elliot?

257
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,071
Don't be a pain in the neck, Arnold.
We just got here.

258
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,829
I'm going outside
for a breath of fresh air.

259
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,431
Hey, Arnold. If you find any twins,
don't be greedy.

260
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,350
Hey! Hey!

261
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,910
Hey!

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,912
Ma'am? Please stop.

263
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,111
Stop, I say.

264
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,151
Hey! Please stop!

265
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,430
Excuse me, ma'am!

266
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,993
Stop!

267
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,156
Stop, stop, I say!

268
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,710
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

269
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,833
- Are you one of the monsters?
- I've been called a lot of things.

270
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,315
- But not a monster.
- You're human?

271
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,000
<i>Very</i> human. You wanna see?

272
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,597
- Are you sick?
- They made me eat that stuff.

273
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,473
- I think I'm dying.
- They who?

274
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,956
- Who are you talking about?
- There they are!

275
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,718
<i>(growling)</i>

276
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,789
- Uh, what are they?
- Monsters!

277
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,357
- What do you want from me?
- Uh... Wait here.

278
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,438
Wait here. I'll take care of 'em.

279
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,757
<i>(throaty growls)</i>

280
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,677
Let me give you some advice, you dwarfs.

281
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,993
Get out of here or
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

282
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,998
<i>(growls intensify)</i>

283
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,672
- What do we have to do?
- And remember...

284
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,633
<i>(ferocious growling)</i>

285
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,830
Did you guys hear that yell?

286
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,589
It was probably just Arnold
deflowering a Nilbog virgin.

287
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,030
No, that wasn't the scream
of a woman. That was Arnold.

288
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,029
Well, then, it was probably a girl
from Nilbog deflowering Arnold.

289
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,593
Probably!

290
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,869
<i>(cries out)</i>

291
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,511
Let's get out of here! Quick!

292
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,553
Let's hide in this house.

293
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,034
What kind of a place is this?

294
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,360
This is <i>my</i> house!

295
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,391
Allow me to introduce myself.

296
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,275
I am Creedence Leonor Gielgud,

297
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,518
of ancient druid origins.

298
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,033
My ancestors came from Stonehenge.

299
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,037
Am I mistaken or is there something
wrong with the two of you?

300
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,077
We... We need a doctor, ma'am.
Please call the nearest hospital.

301
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,636
There is no hospital in Nilbog.

302
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,276
We are used to curing ourselves.

303
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,471
Here we are.

304
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,797
This broth

305
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,150
is miraculous.

306
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,273
It contains sap from the forest.

307
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,919
It is a concentration of all
the vegetal properties of the earth.

308
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,870
Drink of it.

309
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,433
Children!

310
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,916
My poor children!

311
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,558
<i>(cries out)</i>

312
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,430
<i>(splutters)</i>

313
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,910
What's wrong? What's wrong with her?

314
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,191
Don't worry about her.
Drink your broth.

315
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,276
<i>(moaning)</i>

316
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,273
- I can't move! Why?
- You talk too much for me.

317
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,115
What's happening? Why can't I move?
There must be a logical reason.

318
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,754
Shut up!

319
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,795
She's... She's changing!

320
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,509
She is purifying herself.

321
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,110
Now she is one
with the vegetable world.

322
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,394
- <i>(screams)</i>
- Now she is food for my children.

323
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,314
Oh!

324
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,352
Make yourselves comfortable!

325
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,154
Dinner is ready.

326
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,956
They're eating her.
And then they're going to eat me!

327
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,196
<i>(voracious gobbling)</i>

328
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,589
Oh, my God!

329
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,473
I don't like this place, not one bit.

Dear Elliot Cooper.

333
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,677
Tomorrow morning
will be your final judgment.

334
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,360
Either me or your boys.

335
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,914
Take it or leave it.

336
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,996
The beautiful Holly Waits

337
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,078
or your lovely little boys.

338
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,156
Make a choice, Elliot!

339
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,108
Joshua! Joshua!

00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,112
Dad!

342
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,595
Mom! Mom!

343
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,075
What is it? What's the matter?

344
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,033
- What's wrong?
- I saw him.

345
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,630
- Who? Who did you see?
- Grandpa Seth.

346
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,793
See? It wasn't me this time!

347
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,789
It was a reflection in the mirror.

348
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,630
It was him. Grandpa Seth
was calling out to Joshua.

349
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,800
I'm tired of this.
Come with me, all of you.

350
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,600
So where's that damn mirror?

351
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,598
It's right... It's right there.

352
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,715
Look, there's no one other than us.

353
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,910
But he was there before.

354
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,157
It's gotta be your imagination
or a hallucination.

355
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,829
- Are you still smoking dope, Holly?
- I swore I wouldn't, Dad.

356
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,192
I want to get up early in the morning.
We're still farmers, right?

357
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,869
I am not sleeping in this room.

358
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,073
- Didn't you hear what your father said?
- I'm not sleeping here.

359
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,156
I'll sleep here.

360
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,909
- You would really do that for me?
- Sure.

361
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,349
Why not? I'm not afraid.

362
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,034
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Josh. Thank you.

363
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,833
Good night, Josh. Now, go to sleep!

364
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,036
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Are you here?

365
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,512
- What happened?
- You were in the wrong room!

366
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,596
Holly was sleeping there.

367
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,757
I still have to learn
the layout of this house.

368
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,791
I'm glad to see you, Grandpa.

369
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,350
Did you see?
I managed to keep them from eating.

370
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,438
Now, you have to convince them
to leave here.

371
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,835
This is an evil place.

372
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,793
It is the kingdom of the goblins.

373
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,959
But why don't <i>you</i> tell my mommy
and daddy these things?

374
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,154
They don't listen to me.
Your mother has never taken my advice.

375
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,317
That's why she married
that good-for-nothing.

376
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,715
<i>(crackling)</i>

377
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,516
The powers of evil are very strong here.
I must leave.

378
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,076
But I'll be back, Joshua.
I'll be back.

379
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,870
Grandpa? Only <i>you</i>
can do something. Only <i>you.</i>

380
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,878
Damn! There's no milk.
There's no coffee. There's nothing.

381
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,154
- Didn't anyone remember to get supplies?
- We left in too much of a hurry, Drew.

382
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,393
- Go into town. Do the shopping now.
- With what? I don't have any money.

383
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,672
- Just take it out of the group fund.
- OK.

384
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,114
Is breakfast ready, dear?

385
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,635
There's nothing in the whole house.
No eggs, no bacon.

386
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,436
There's just a lot of milk,
but it's all like this.

387
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,874
It must be a week old.

388
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,428
Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Dad.

389
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,313
- <i>(Holly)</i> What's for breakfast?
- Nothing.

390
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,352
What? I'm hungry enough
to eat a horse.

391
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,596
I've been fasting for two days.

392
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,793
Josh and I will run into town
to the general store. Right, Josh?

393
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,515
- OK.
- We won't be gone long.

394
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,118
- Hello, son.
- Hi.

395
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,470
Are you in training?

396
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,149
- No. Just goin' shopping.
- Hop in. You'll save your breath.

397
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,555
OK. Thanks.

398
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,952
- I'm Sheriff Gene Freak.
- Oh, nice to meet you, Sheriff.

399
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,674
Are you just passing through Nilbog?

400
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,394
I'm on vacation with some friends.

401
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,796
We parked our camper on the road.

402
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,196
- Are you hungry?
- Well, a little bit. Yeah.

403
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,311
<i>(eerie music drowns out voices)</i>

404
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,991
- Thanks. It's good.
- I'm sure you'll all enjoy Nilbog.

405
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,430
We're hospitable people,
especially to strangers.

406
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,316
Here's the general store.

407
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,711
Oh, where do the girls around here
go at night?

408
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,638
Ha-ha! The girls! That's good!

409
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,479
<i>(laughs raucously)</i>

410
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,756
- Can I help you?
- Coffee.

411
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,317
There's no coffee here in Nilbog.
It's the Devil's drink!

412
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,998
Eggs.

413
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,236
- Eugh!
- Bacon.

414
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,035
Are you crazy, boy?
We're vegetarians here in Nilbog.

415
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,232
Didn't you know that?

416
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,590
Here's some Nilbog milk.

417
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,951
Special milk, high in vitamin content.

418
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,072
- Here, it's free.
- Free?

419
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,749
Of course it's free.
We love tourists here in Nilbog.

420
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,273
Try some, boy. And have some
of your friends drink some also.

421
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,789
Thank you.

422
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,952
D'you feel all right?

423
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,912
Yeah.

424
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,590
- Hey, you.
- Yeah?

425
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,190
- Your friend has a message for you.
- Who? Arnold?

426
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,950
Yeah. He said to meet him in the house
that looks like an old church.

427
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,036
OK.

428
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,790
You can go through the woods.
It's only about a mile away.

429
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,153
Good morning, my little flower.

430
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,316
Oh!

431
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,195
No need to worry about the closed mouth.

432
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,233
You didn't have anything to say anyway.

433
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,032
Right?

434
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,596
With this you will become strong

435
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,632
and beautiful.

436
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,515
Now, I am going to welcome
our new neighbours.

437
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,198
I have just prepared this pudding

438
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,039
with wild nettles

439
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,073
and a few organic additives

440
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,998
to make it delicious

441
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,511
and purify the intestines.

442
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,435
See you later, my little flower.

443
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,434
We have to wait and be patient.

444
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,831
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Are you there?

445
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,634
Nilbog! It's "goblin" spelt backwards!

446
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,912
This is their kingdom.

447
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,992
Good morning.

448
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,395
I am your neighbour.

449
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,595
- I am Creedence Leonor Gielgud.
- Good morning.

450
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,393
Mom, I'm going for a walk.

451
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,195
- Hello, beautiful!
- Hi.

452
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,039
She is very

453
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,038
- appetising.
- Appetising?

454
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,276
Provocative.

455
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,953
I thought you might enjoy
one of my ancient recipes.

456
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,675
It's a traditional dish in these parts.

457
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,837
You shouldn't have gone
to so much trouble.

458
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,554
No trouble.

459
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,432
Really.

460
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,592
The lowest instincts
are spreading in a horrifying way.

461
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,475
All men, especially men from the cities,

462
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,630
are letting themselves succumb
to the vices of meat...

463
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,640
The flesh.
The decaying part of the body.

464
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,118
It is so material and repulsive.
Repulsive!

465
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,310
They're still here!

466
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,477
Symbol of original sin,

467
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,754
which has consumed and
caused the fall of the human race

468
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,555
which is so dear to us.

469
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,272
Flesh!

470
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,594
And by flesh I mean
all that stinking, disgusting meat.

471
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,757
- <i>(everyone)</i> Eugh.
- Hamburgers!

472
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,431
- Eugh!
- Steaks, the steak sausages!

473
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,918
And hot dogs,
sold by the side of the road.

474
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,160
The stink of smoked carcasses.

475
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,633
Eugh!

476
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,796
<i>(groaning)</i>

477
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,357
The humans nourish themselves
with these,

478
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,517
violating their own bodies,

479
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,949
infecting themselves,

480
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,312
creating uncurable ailments.

481
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,193
- Smelly bladders.
- Eugh!

482
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,517
Nests of infection.

483
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,394
- Clusters of haemorrhoids!
- Eugh!

484
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,592
Vicious, stinking

485
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,676
excrement!

486
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,394
Vicious, stinking...

487
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,510
Argh!

488
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,351
Elliot? Elliot!

489
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,514
Holly. What a surprise.

490
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,030
Choose, Elliot. Either me or your friends.

491
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,037
I don't understand.

492
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,752
D'you understand now?

493
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,871
Is it ready?

494
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,673
Here it is. Nice and creamy.

495
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,472
This is a wonderful cup of Nilbog
ice cream for a little child.

496
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,030
You're going to stuff yourself
with it, aren't you?

497
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,358
Kids with a sweet tooth like yours
love ice cream.

498
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,397
Help, Grandpa Seth! Help!

499
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,310
<i>(everyone)</i> Mm.
Open your mouth, my little friend.

500
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,477
Please, open it.

501
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,353
<i>(Joshua)</i> I won't! I don't want to!

502
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,800
<i>(everyone)</i> Mm!
Open your mouth, my little friend.

503
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,992
Please, open it!

504
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,918
Mmmm!

505
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,793
No, I won't! I don't want to!

506
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,354
Joshua!

507
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,470
Stop!

508
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,750
What are you doing to my son?

509
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,317
- We were giving him some ice cream.
- Daddy, they're goblins!

510
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,557
- Monstrous beings!
- What?

511
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,150
They were giving me ice cream
so they could eat me later.

512
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,989
An active imagination.
A bit morbid, isn't he?

the shape of a clover leaf!

514
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,915
And Nilbog is "goblin" spelt backwards.

515
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,600
I'm telling you, Daddy. They're monsters.

516
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,954
Mr and Mrs Presents,
what are you doing here?

517
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,277
You were supposed to be at my house.

518
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,756
We had car trouble.
We'll be leaving this evening.

519
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,189
OK.

520
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,993
It was nice meeting... meeting all of you.

521
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,759
My son and I must be leaving now.

522
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,157
We need time
for some things to happen.

523
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,316
We must have patience until tonight.

524
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,672
- Christ!
- What?

525
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,759
Your sister Holly's
with that playboy son of the Coopers.

526
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,118
- They're my friends!
- Who do you think you are?

527
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,879
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Stop it!

528
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,638
Oh, no!

529
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,318
- So, kids, how's life?
- Listen, Mr Waits...

530
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,274
I don't speak to people who arrive late
and upset their girlfriends.

531
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,073
- You've given me a bad impression.
- Come on, Dad.

532
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,954
- We'll talk, Holly. OK?
- We need to have a serious talk.

533
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,710
Forget about your friends and
come to our house, or forget about Holly.

534
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,910
- All right. I'm coming.
- Elliot!

535
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,793
- You're gonna leave me here alone?
- Yes.

536
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,992
- What do I tell Drew and Arnold?
- Whatever you want.

537
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,875
- What am I gonna do?
- Take the camper. Do what you want.

538
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,195
What about the beautiful liberated girls?

539
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,916
Is anyone here?

540
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,552

- Get me outta here, Drew. Get me out.
- OK. OK, don't fret.

Grab hold and pull with all your strength.

01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,993
<i>And now it is forever.</i>

688
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:41,910
<i>Together, we can destroy the magic stone</i>
<i>that gives the goblins their power.</i>

689
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,275
<i>Concentrate, Joshua. Concentrate!</i>

690
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,671
Yes, Grandpa.

691
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,796
Joshua?

692
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,990
Joshua? Joshua!

693
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,237
<i>(growls)</i>

694
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,795
Quick! Upstairs!

695
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,075
<i>(roaring and growling)</i>

696
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,916
Michael!

697
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,511
Grandpa!

698
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,837
Grandpa Seth, are you here?

699
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,790
<i>(creaking)</i>

700
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,510
Elliot! Help!

701
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,554
<i>(squeals)</i>

702
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,557
Go away, monster!

703
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,910
<i>(growls)</i>

704
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,917
Quick! Run!

705
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,789
Grandpa, where have you been?

706
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,435
Take this. Keep it.

707
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,951
You can only take out the contents
when you really need it.

708
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,799
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

709
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,275
And now?

710
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:59,076
Here it is - the Stonehenge magic stone.

711
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,953
The goblins' magic power.

712
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,232
What do we have to do, Grandpa?

713
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,638
Touch it. Only touch it.

714
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,593
Will it work?

715
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,830
I hope so.

716
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,070
<i>(throaty growl)</i>

717
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,438
Please, let's talk.
We're all humans here.

718
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:43,113
No more! No more popcorn.

719
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,912
<i>(piercing scream)</i>

720
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,357
Our queen is calling us.

721
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,637
Joshua is alone right now. Let's go.

722
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,998
Grandpa! Nothing's happening.

723
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,839
Something <i>has</i> happened now, Joshua.

724
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,753
- <i>(clock strikes)</i>
- I'm leaving.

725
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,599
Oh, no, Grandpa. Not now.

726
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,508
Joshua, I have to do this once again.

727
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:51,389
Remember, it's only the power of
goodness that can defeat the goblins.

728
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,794
Goodbye forever.

729
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,036
Goodbye, Grandpa.

730
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,196
Goodbye.

731
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,351
Argh!

732
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:15,629
What were you going to do, little one?

733
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,309
<i>(evil laugh)</i>

734
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,948
Get off!

735
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,154
And now,

736
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,475
we are going to feed you,

737
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,909
Joshua.

738
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,795
You've been fasting two days.

739
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,798
You're hungry,

740
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,957
right?

741
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,355
A double-decker baloney sandwich!

742
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,311
<i>(gasps)</i>

743
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,874
Don't do it!

744
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,992
Think about the fat in your blood!

745
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,954
Think about the cholesterol.

746
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,277
Think about the toxins!

747
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,595
Oh! No!

748
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,551
No!

749
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,710
Joshua!

750
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,789
Grandpa Seth's voice brought us here.

751
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,794
Quick, help me. Put your hands
on the stone and concentrate.

752
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,558
- What?
- Don't you see?

753
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:13,037
Only the power of goodness
can destroy these monsters.

754
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,118
- Put your hands on the stone.
- <i>(ferocious growling)</i>

755
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,557
Concentrate!

756
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,596
Concentrate more!

757
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,273
Concentrate!

758
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,749
Ingrate!

759
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,271
<i>(screaming stops)</i>

760
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,790
- I have to pass by the office.
- I need to go home for a while.

761
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:59,119
- I'll come with you.
- Joshua and I will wait for you at home.

762
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,351
Want some fruit, Joshua?
The fruit is still very good.

763
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:19,519
I don't want to eat for the next 20 years.

764
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,677
Mm. It's delicious!

765
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,588
- I'm going to my room to take a nap.
- Good idea.

766
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,678
I think I'll take a shower first.

767
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,356
<i>(sighs)</i>

768
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,553
I don't know how to thank you, Grandpa.

769
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,956
I hope you're OK up there.

770
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,231
<i>(whispering) Joshua. Joshua.</i>

771
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,669
<i>(eerie whisperings)</i>

772
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,868
<i>(shower running)</i>

773
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,597
Mom?

774
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,353
Mommy!

775
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,755
Mommy!

776
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,637
Mommy!

777
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,999
They're eating my mom!

778
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:45,071
Do you want some, Joshua?

779
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,399
