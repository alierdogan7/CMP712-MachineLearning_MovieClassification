1
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:01,316
How beautifully dramatic.

2
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:06,083
The crudest, savage, exhibition
of nature at her worst, without,

3
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,001
and we three, we elegant three, within.

4
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,882
l should like to think that an irate Jehovah

5
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,118
was pointing those arrows
of lightning directly at my head.

6
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:21,565
The unbowed head of George Gordon,
Lord Byron, England's greatest sinner.

7
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,559
But l cannot flatter myself to that extent.

8
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:27,115
Possibly those thunders
are for our dear Shelley.

9
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,801
Heaven's applause
for England's greatest poet.

10
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:33,643
- What of my Mary?
- She is an angel.

11
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:36,799
- You think so?
- <i>(thunder)</i>

12
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,643
You hear?

13
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,161
Come, Mary. Come and watch the storm.

14
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,636
You know how lightning alarms me.

15
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,676
Shelley, darling, will you please
light these candles for me?

16
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,678
Mary, darling.

17
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,917
Astonishing creature.

18
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:57,205
- l, Lord Byron?
- Frightened of thunder, fearful of the dark.

19
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:01,166
And yet you have written a tale
that sent my blood into icy creeps.

20
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:06,716
Look at her, Shelley. Can you believe that
lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein?

21
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:10,766
A monster created from
cadavers out of rifled graves.

22
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:14,556
- lsn't it astonishing?
- l don't know why you should think so.

23
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,399
What do you expect?

24
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:20,321
Such an audience needs something
stronger than a pretty little love story.

25
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,557
So why shouldn't l write of monsters?

26
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:26,595
No wonder Murray's refused to publish
the book. His public would be shocked.

27
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,837
lt will be published, l think.

28
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:31,885
Then, darling, you will have
much to answer for.

29
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:36,882
The publishers did not see that
my purpose was to write a moral lesson

30
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:42,121
of the punishment that befell
a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

31
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:46,962
Whatever your purpose was, l take great
relish in savouring each separate horror.

32
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,038
l roll them over on my tongue.

33
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:52,119
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.

34
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:55,279
What a setting in that
churchyard to begin with!

35
00:03:55,367 --> 00:04:01,761
<i>The sobbing women, the first clod of earth</i>
o<i>n the coffin. That was a pretty chill.</i>

36
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:05,840
<i>Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing</i>
<i>the body out of its new-made grave.</i>

37
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:10,564
<i>Cutting the hanged man down from</i>
<i>the gallows, where he swung in the wind.</i>

38
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:13,560
<i>The cunning of Frankenstein</i>
<i>in his mountain laboratory,</i>

39
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:17,959
<i>picking dead men apart and</i>
<i>building up a human monster</i>

40
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,484
<i>so fearful and so horrible that only</i>
<i>a half-crazed brain could have devised.</i>

41
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,524
<i>And then the murders,</i>
<i>the little child who <i>drowned.</i>

42
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:31,157
<i>Henry Frankenstein himself</i>
<i>thrown from the top of the burning mill</i>

43
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,556
<i>by the very monster he had created.</i>

44
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:38,960
And it was these fragile white fingers
that penned the nightmare.

45
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:42,005
Ah! You've made me prick myself, Byron.

46
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,963
lt's bleeding.

47
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:50,405
There, there. l do think it a shame, Mary,
to end your story quite so suddenly.

48
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:55,117
That wasn't the end at all. Would you
like to hear what happened after that?

49
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,357
l feel like telling it.

50
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,280
lt's a perfect night for mystery and horror.

51
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,677
The air itself is filled with monsters.

52
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:09,524
l'm all ears. While heaven blasts the night
without, open up your pits of hell.

53
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:14,444
Well, then, imagine yourselves
standing by the wreckage of the mill.

54
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:17,041
The fire is dying down.

55
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:21,006
<i>Soon the bare skeleton</i>
o<i>f the building rolls over,</i>

56
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,521
<i>the gaunt rafters against the sky.</i>

57
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,838
<i>(yelling)</i>

58
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:45,961
Well, l must say, that's the best fire
l ever saw in all me life.

59
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,165
- What are you cryin' for?
- lt's terrible.

60
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:55,923
l know. But after all them murders and
poor Mr Henry being brought home to die,

61
00:05:56,007 --> 00:06:00,523
l'm glad to see the monster
roasted to death before my very eyes.

62
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,757
lt's too good for him.

63
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:08,160
lt's all the devil's work, and you'd better
cross yourself quick before he gets you.

64
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,880
Come along, come along. lt's all over.

65
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,442
Get back to your homes and go to sleep.

66
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,325
There it goes again.
lt ain't burnt out at all.

67
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:23,683
- There's more yet.
- lsn't the monster dead yet?

68
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,077
lt's high time every decent
man and wife was in bed.

69
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,403
That's his insides caught at last.

70
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:33,240
lnsides is always the last to be consumed.

71
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,761
Move on. You've had enough
excitement for one night.

72
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:39,237
This strange man
you call a monster is dead.

73
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,557
Monster, indeed!

74
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:46,960
You may thank your lucky stars they sent
for me to safeguard life and property.

75
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,959
Why didn't you safeguard
those drownded and murdered?

76
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:53,756
Come, now. We want no rallying, no riots.

77
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,077
- Who's riotin'?
- Move on, move on.

78
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,761
Good night all, and pleasant dreams.

79
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,156
Ah, pleasant dreams yourself.

80
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:05,925
Thinks he's everybody just because
he's a burgomaster. Huh!

81
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:16,116
Poor Mr Henry. He was to have been
married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth.

82
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:20,519
Cover him up. Someone must
break the news to the poor girl.

83
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,916
Ride as fast as you can to the castle,

84
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:26,636
and tell the old Baron Frankenstein
we are bringing his son home.

85
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,481
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, shut up.

86
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,718
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.

87
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:40,085
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace.
Why do you stay here?

88
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:43,443
l want to see with my own eyes.

89
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.

90
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,999
And, dead or alive, nothing can
bring our little Maria back to us.

91
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:54,877
lf l can see his blackened bones,
l can sleep at night.

92
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:58,958
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!

93
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:03,006
Maria drowned to death and
you burned up! What should l do then?

94
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:05,078
No!

95
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,478
<i>(growls)</i>

96
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,841
Hans. Hans!

97
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,715
Where are you? Hans!
Are you all right?

98
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:55,644
l hear you. Here,
give me your hand, Hans.

99
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,398
Here.

100
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,639
<i>(screams)</i>

101
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,398
<i>(growls)</i>

102
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,601
<i>(screams)</i>

103
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,358
<i>(bangs on door)</i>

104
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,806
Oh, heaven, what is this?

105
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:09,556
Henry? Tell me.

106
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:13,242
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?

107
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,126
Bring him in.

108
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,247
- Albert.
- What do you want?

109
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,524
lt's alive. The monster, it's alive!

110
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,846
- Ah, shut up, you old fool.
- l saw it.

111
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:45,839
lt ain't turned to no skeleton at all.

112
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:48,043
lt lived right through the fire.

113
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,324
Ah, go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.

114
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:53,318
Nobody'll believe me.

115
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,796
All right, l'll wash my hands of it.

116
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:59,357
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds.

117
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:32,842
- Speak to me, Henry.
- Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.

118
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,677
l was foretold of this.

119
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:38,520
l was told beware my wedding night.

120
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,127
Oh, look, milady! He's alive!

121
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,283
Henry, darling.

122
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,158
Elizabeth.

123
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:02,599
Oh, what a terrible wedding night.

124
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,398
You can go to bed now, Mary.

125
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,520
- You'll soon be better.
- l feel almost myself again.

126
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:35,600
When you're strong enough, we'll go
away and forget this horrible experience.

127
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,997
Forget? lf only l could forget.

128
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,282
But it's never out of my mind.

129
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,837
l've been cursed for delving
into the mysteries of life.

130
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,715
Perhaps death is sacred,
and l've profaned it.

131
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:51,879
For what a wonderful vision it was.

132
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:58,361
l dreamed of being the first to give to the
world the secret that God is so jealous of.

133
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:01,120
The formula for life.

134
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:04,643
Think of the power to create a man.

135
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:08,200
And l did. l did it. l created a man.

136
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,484
And who knows? ln time l could
have trained him to do my will.

137
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,726
l could have bred a race. l might even
have found the secret of eternal life.

138
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:20,323
Henry, don't say those things. Don't
think them. lt's blasphemous and wicked.

139
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:22,204
We are not meant to know those things.

140
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:25,438
lt may be that l'm intended
to know the secret of life.

141
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,715
lt may be part of the divine plan.

142
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,197
No, no. lt's the devil that prompts you.

143
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,836
lt's death, not life, that is in it all
and at the end of it all.

144
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:40,921
Listen, while you've been lying here,
tossing in your delirium, l couldn't sleep.

145
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,316
And when you rave of your insane desire

146
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,160
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

147
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,557
a strange apparition has
seemed to appear in the room.

148
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:55,596
lt comes, a figure like Death. And
each time it comes more clearly, nearer.

149
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:59,282
lt seems to be reaching out for you,
as if it would take you away from me!

150
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,676
There it is. Look.

151
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,916
- There.
- l see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?

152
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:08,043
There's nothing there.

153
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,880
There! There! lt's coming for you!

154
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,926
Nearer! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!

155
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,998
<i>(laughs hysterically)</i> Henry!

156
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,121
<i>(banging on door)</i>

157
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:30,435
Albert! Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.

158
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,198
- What's the good of footmen anyway?
- <i>(bell rings)</i>

159
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,755
All right. All right!

160
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:40,362
Don't knock the castle over!
We're not all dead yet.

161
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,279
- There's nobody at home.
- Let me in, my good woman.

162
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,279
l know the young
Baron Frankenstein is at home.

163
00:14:56,367 --> 00:15:00,679
He's sick. He's in his bed, where all
decent folk should be at this time of night.

164
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:06,000
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here
on a secret matter of grave importance,

165
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,920
and must see him alone, tonight.

166
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:13,597
Dr Pretorius?

167
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,518
Pretorius?

168
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,078
- What was it? What was the name?
- Dr Pretorius.

169
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:26,802
There ain't no such name.

170
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,678
Now, you stay there.

171
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,479
- Who's there?
- lt's Minnie, milady.

172
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,558
<i>(Henry)</i> Oh, come in.

173
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,437
lt's Dr Pretorius.

174
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:55,361
He says he wants to see
the master. Most insistent.

175
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:56,926
Pretorius?

176
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:59,441
He's a very queer-looking
old gentleman, sir.

177
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:03,440
And must see you, on a secret,
grave matter, he said.

178
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,404
Tonight. Alone.

179
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:08,797
- Bring him in.
- Henry, who is this man?

180
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:10,764
Dr Pretorius.

181
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,920
Baron Frankenstein now, l believe?

182
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,316
Won't you come in, Doctor?

183
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:23,243
l trust you will pardon
this intrusion at so late an hour.

184
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,877
l would not have ventured to come,
had l not a communication to make

185
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,562
which l suspect may be
of the utmost importance to yourself.

186
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:35,478
This is Professor Pretorius. He used to be
Doctor of Philosophy at the university.

187
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:38,161
- But, uh...
- But was booted out.

188
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,807
Booted, my dear Baron, is the word.

189
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,764
For knowing too much.

190
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,044
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.

191
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,357
l am also a doctor, Baroness.

192
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,483
Why have you come here tonight?

193
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:53,479
My business with you, Baron, is private.

194
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,558
Elizabeth, please.

195
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,638
l do hope he won't upset Henry.

196
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:09,596
- What do you want?
- We must work together.

197
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,838
Never. This is outrageous.

198
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:17,523
l'm through with it.
l'll have no more of this hell-spawn.

199
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:21,441
As soon as l'm well,
l'm to be married, and l'm going away.

200
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,597
l must beg you to reconsider.

201
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,361
You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

202
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,484
who are responsible
for all those murders?

203
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:33,999
There are penalties
to pay for killing people.

204
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,204
And with your creature
still at large in the countryside...

205
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,357
Are you threatening me?

206
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,483
Don't put it so crudely.

207
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:46,243
l had ventured to hope that you and l
together, no longer as master and pupil,

208
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:50,764
but as fellow scientists, might probe
the mysteries of life and death...

209
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,485
Never. No further.

210
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,479
..and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

211
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,321
l can't make any further experiments.
l've had a terrible lesson.

212
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,523
That is sad, very sad.

213
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,607
But you and l have gone too far to stop.

214
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,565
Nor can it be stopped so easily.

215
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:10,445
l also have continued
with my experiments.

216
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,916
That is why l am here tonight.

217
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,396
You must see <i>my</i> creation.

218
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,480
Have you also succeeded
in bringing life to the dead?

219
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,877
lf you, Herr Baron, will do me the honour
of visiting my humble abode,

220
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,198
l think you will be interested
in what l have to show you.

221
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:31,315
After 20 years of secret scientific
research, and countless failures,

222
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:37,198
l also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

223
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,518
l must know. When can l see it?

224
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,962
l thought you might change your mind.

225
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,845
Why not tonight? lt is not very late.

226
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,597
- ls it far?
- No, but you will need a coat.

227
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,956
l think your coachman
had better wait here.

228
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,483
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?

229
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,882
Before l show you the results
of my trifling experiments,

230
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,481
l would like to drink to our partnership.

231
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,684
Do you like gin? lt is my only weakness.

232
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,601
To a new world of gods and monsters.

233
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,726
Creation of life is enthralling,

234
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,401
distinctly enthralling, is it not?

235
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,275
l cannot account precisely
for all that l am going to show you.

236
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,246
But perhaps now that
you are my partner, you can.

237
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:46,517
My experiments did not turn out
quite like yours, Henry.

238
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:53,523
But science, like love, has her
little surprises, as you shall see.

239
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,565
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?

240
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:59,525
There is a pleasing variety
about my exhibits.

241
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,317
My first experiment was so lovely

242
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,557
that we made her a queen.

243
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,438
Charming, don't you think?

244
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,126
Then, of course, we had to have a king.

245
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,840
Now he's so madly in love with her
that we have to segregate them.

246
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:28,126
Now now. l have to be
very careful with the king.

247
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:33,363
Now, behave.

248
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:37,201
My next production looked
so disapprovingly at the other two

249
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,837
that they made him an archbishop.

250
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,282
He seems to be asleep.
l must wake him up.

251
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:49,077
The next one is the very devil.

252
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,443
Very bizarre, this little chap.

253
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,839
There's a certain resemblance to me,
don't you think? Or do l flatter myself?

254
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,316
l took a great deal of pains with him.

255
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:02,123
Sometimes l have wondered whether
life wouldn't be much more amusing

256
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,323
if we were all devils,

257
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,116
and no nonsense about
angels and being good.

258
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,843
Oh, there's the king out again.

259
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,802
Even royal amours are a nuisance.

260
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:18,196
<i>(squeaking)</i>

261
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,800
<i>(blows whistle)</i>

262
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:29,485
Poor Archbishop. He has his hands full.

263
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:32,436
There. That'll keep you quiet.

264
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:36,837
My little ballerina is charming,
but such a bore.

265
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:39,646
She'll only dance to
Mendelssohn's ''Spring Song'',

266
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,718
and it gets so monotonous.

267
00:22:42,287 --> 00:22:44,642
My next is very conventional, l'm afraid.

268
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:47,605
But you can never tell
how these things will turn out.

269
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,565
lt was an experiment with seaweed.

270
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:53,081
Normal size has been my difficulty.

271
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:55,317
You did achieve size.

272
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,557
l need to work that out with you.

273
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:07,201
But this isn't science.

274
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,243
lt's more like black magic.

275
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,445
You think l'm mad. Perhaps l am.

276
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:14,358
But listen, Henry Frankenstein,

277
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:18,406
while you were digging in your graves
piecing together dead tissues,

278
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:22,480
l, my dear pupil, went for my material
to the source of life.

279
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:29,246
l grew my creatures, like cultures.
Grew them as nature does, from seed.

280
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:34,196
But, still, you did achieve
results that l have missed. Now, think.

281
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,802
What a world-astounding
collaboration we should be,

282
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,118
you and l, together.

283
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,845
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,237
Leave the charnel house
and follow the lead of nature,

285
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:50,319
or of God, if you like your Bible stories.

286
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:54,605
Male and female, created He them.

287
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,167
Be fruitful and multiply.

288
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:04,083
Create a race, a man-made race
upon the face of the earth. Why not?

289
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,920
l daren't. l daren't even think
of such a thing.

290
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:09,919
Our mad dream is only half realised.

291
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:12,680
Alone you have created a man.

292
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:17,158
Now together we will create his mate.

293
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:19,965
You mean...?

294
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:23,557
Yes, a woman.

295
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,559
That should be really interesting.

296
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,482
<i>(cries out)</i>

297
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:48,845
Please don't touch me!

298
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,640
- There she is! Quick!
- <i>(screams)</i>

299
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,558
There he is. Shoot.

300
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:11,917
Run to the village, quick.
lt's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.

301
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,561
- What is it now?
- The monster! He's in the woods.

302
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:32,117
Get the bloodhounds. Raise all the
men you can, lock the women indoors

303
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,198
and wait for me.

304
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:41,076
Now then! Monster, indeed!
l'll show him. Follow me.

305
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,600
<i>(growls)</i>

306
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,963
Where is he?

307
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,796
Bind him securely.
l don't want anything slipshod.

308
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:53,482
Tie his feet first. His feet first!

309
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,604
l get no cooperation. None at all.

310
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,440
Have you got him? That's what
l want to know. Have you got him?

311
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,563
Of course we've got him,
my good woman.

312
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,639
A good job too.
Mind he don't get loose again.

313
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:07,560
He might do some damage
and hurt somebody.

314
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:12,004
- Bring him down when you've bound him.
- You want any help there? l'll bind him!

315
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:07,563
Now take him down to the old dungeon
and put him in chains.

316
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,965
There you are.
Find some rope and tie him up.

317
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:31,397
Come on, then. Get back to your work.

318
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,566
Keep still.

319
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:52,637
That's quite enough. Come and lock your
doors. We can't take all day over this.

320
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:01,643
l'd hate to find him under my bed at night.
He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.

321
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:04,241
Get away, there! Clear that window!

322
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:08,639
Hah! You mind your own business and
see he doesn't get out. He's dangerous.

323
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:11,195
Now l can get back
to more important duties.

324
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:12,766
- Way past our hours.
- Hm?

325
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:15,998
- The night, sir.
- Monster, indeed.

326
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:18,078
Tush, tush.

327
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:36,083
<i>(growls)</i>

328
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,158
He's loose! Shoot him!

329
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,238
Help! He's loose!

330
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:01,916
Go to your homes.
Just an escaped lunatic.

331
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:05,682
Merely wanted someone to handle it,
that's all. Quite harmless.

332
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:16,879
Shoot him! Why don't you shoot him?

333
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:30,437
Where's Frieda?

334
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:33,476

- Send him away. l won't see him.
- l certainly will.

515
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,598
Good evening, Henry.

516
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:20,755
Baroness, l've not yet had the opportunity

517
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:24,157
of offering you
my congratulations on your marriage.

518
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:27,796
- Pray accept them now.
- Dr Pretorius.

519
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:30,765
l don't know what your business is
but, whatever it may be,

520
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:33,759
l tell you frankly
that l am not frightened of it or of you.

521
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:37,999
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state
to be alarmed or annoyed.

522
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:40,362
Your visit now is most unwelcome.

523
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:46,801
Henry, l heard the carriage drive up.
l'll see that the baggage is put in.

524
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,521
Then we're leaving.

525
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:57,481
l think you know why l am here, Henry.

526
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:03,678
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiments is complete.

527
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:09,478
l have created, by my method, a perfect
human brain - already living, but dormant.

528
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:13,242
Everything is now ready for you and me
to begin our supreme collaboration.

529
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:17,206
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
l don't want to hear.

530
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:21,485
l've changed my mind. l won't do it.

531
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,239
l expected this.

532
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:27,076
l thought we might need
another assistant.

533
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:30,238
Perhaps <i>he</i> can persuade you.

534
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:33,884
- Nothing can persuade me.
- We shall see.

535
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:40,716
- No! Not that!
- Oh, he's harmless, except when crossed.

536
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,079
Frankenstein.

537
00:50:50,287 --> 00:50:53,597
Yes, there have been developments
since he came to me.

538
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:05,037
Sit down.

539
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:11,437
- What do you want?
- You know.

540
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,836
- This is your work.
- Yes.

541
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:15,997
l'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

542
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:19,363
- Yes. Must.
- Get him out.

543
00:51:19,447 --> 00:51:21,358
l won't even discuss it until he's gone.

544
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:23,798
Go now.

545
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:27,362

547
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:44,756
- Must do it.
- Nothing can make me go on with it.

548

549
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:52,157

Put the bags in the carriage
and l'll be out in a moment.

551
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:16,081
Go and tell the master to hurry,
Minnie, or we shall lose the train.

552
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,760
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady,

553
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,315
but l don't like leaving you alone.

554
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:28,559
- Oh, nonsense, Minnie, l shall be all right.
- l hope so, milady.

What is it? What's the matter?

563
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:14,442
Oh, sir, she's gone!

564
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:17,121
The monster, he's got her!

565
00:53:17,207 --> 00:53:20,165
l saw it. The baroness is gone!

566
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:25,442
This is Pretorius' doing. Quick, search
parties. There's not a moment to lose.

567
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:27,518
<i>(crash)</i>

568
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,205
l charge you,
as you value your mistress' life,

to do nothing
and say nothing of this episode.

570
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:37,564
l assure you that the baroness
will be safely returned,

571
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,036
if you will leave everything to me.

572
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,721
Nothing, that is, except what he demands.

573
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,358
l can find no trace of Elizabeth.

574
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:13,520
Oh, l admit l'm beaten.

575
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:17,080
But if you can bring her back,

576
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,317
l'll do anything that you want.

577
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:22,797
Are you ready to complete with me
this final experiment?

578
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,401
- What about Elizabeth?
- She is well,

579
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:29,162
and will be safely returned
if you will proceed.

580
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:31,882
- l'm ready.
- Ah.

581
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:48,360
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, l expect.

582
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,438
l think it's a charming house.

583
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,839
lt is interesting to think
that once upon a time

584
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:10,886
we should have been burnt at the stake
as wizards for this experiment.

585
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:13,879
Doctor, l think the heart is beating.

586
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,720
Look. lt's beating.

587
00:55:20,807 --> 00:55:24,925
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
- lncrease the saline solution.

588
00:55:28,527 --> 00:55:32,839
- ls there any life yet?
- No, not life itself yet.

589
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:35,487
This is only the simulacrum of life.

590
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:39,037
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

591
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:43,678
We must be patient. The heart is more
complex than any other part of the body.

592
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:47,241
Look. The beat is increasing.

593
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,636
Yes...

594
00:55:50,207 --> 00:55:53,040
- lt's stopped.
- Shall l increase the current?

595
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:58,281
This heart is useless.

596
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:03,600
l must have another.
And it must be sound and young.

597
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,718
Karl.

598
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:11,844
You must go to your friend
at the accident hospital.

599
00:56:11,927 --> 00:56:16,239
What we need is a female victim
of sudden death. Can you do it?

600
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:18,841
lf you promise me a thousand crowns.

601
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:22,203
lt will be well worth it,
and the baron will pay.

602
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:25,723
- Yes, yes. Go and get it.
- l'll try.

603
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:36,839
There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

604
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,122
Always.

605
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:41,277
l'll get your heart.

606

l'll go into that room, l'll go into that room
and l'll take my knife out.

607
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:47,326
l'll get her. l'll hold her down
and there she'll be.

00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,158
A thousand crowns.

610
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:08,837
lt's beating perfectly. Just as in life.

611
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:12,397
- Oh, if only l can keep it going until...
- lt was a very fresh one.

l gave the gendarme 50 crowns.

Only, we can't bother about that now.
Can l do anything?

618
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:35,879
No, no, no! l can work better alone.

Don't come near me!

01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:30,685
Get away! Don't! No! No!

The bride of Frankenstein.
