   I'm not a great man, okay?

418
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,503
        I have no life.

419
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,905
       No money. Nothing.

420
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,341

     other people's lives?

421

        - You suffered.

422

423
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,551
             I did.

424
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,325
     I watched my mother..

425

          ...rot away
    with cancer for 5 years.

426
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,871
        It wasn't quick.

427
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,276
          It was slow
      and it was painful.

428
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,814
   And I couldn't do anything
           about it.

00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,282
         <i> I was broke.</i>

      I couldn't help her.

432
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,929
    I couldn't even give her
       a proper funeral.

433
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,899
         <i> Listen to me.</i>

434
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,968
       I didn't take you.

       <i> I don't do that.</i>

436
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:39,776
      <i> I take care of you.</i>

437
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,946
      I never touched you.

438
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,350
      I'm not the hunter.

439
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,853
          I'm only a..

441
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:59,196
      It wasn't personal.

442
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:05,102
       All I ever wanted
       was a decent life.

443
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,037
           A family.

444
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,572
          Maybe a son.

445
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,677
          Just like..

446
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:17,447
  ...Ronnie would have wanted.

447
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,716
        - What the fuck
       did you just say?

448
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,084
           - Ronnie.

       -<i> Yeah, come on.</i>

451
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:31,061
      - My name's Ronnie.
            I'm 25.

         You gotta stop
       what you're doing.

943
