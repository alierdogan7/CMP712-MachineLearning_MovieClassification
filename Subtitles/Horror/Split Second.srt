1
00:02:57,897 --> 00:03:00,767
731 arriving at Lockup 16.
Prisoner on board.

2
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:04,259
- Request assistance.
- Affirmative. Proceed to Bay 2.

3
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,712
This is Thrasher.

4
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:15,466
All units be on the lookout
for Detective Stone.

5
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,423
He's armed and dangerous.

6
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,910
If anyone spots him,
report to me immediately.

7
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:21,674
Durkin, where the hell are you?

8
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:24,496
I've located Stone,
passing Trafalgar Square.

9
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:26,285
On his tail, sir.

10
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,627
While the United States blocks yet
another UN resolution on global warming...

11
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,489
...London continues to suffer...

12
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:37,835
...as the River Thames rises to its highest
level since Black November, 1999.

13
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,529
With the approaching full moon
and persistent rains...

14
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,633
...the further outlook
for Londoners appears bleak.

15
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:47,924
As the tides continue to rise,
the dramatic increase in rat infestation...

16
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,935
...is evident throughout the city.

17
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:52,977
Those attacked should report
to their local rodent center...

18
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,472
...for immediate medical attention.

19
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,502
Police, dickhead.

20
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,807
£50, two drinks minimum.

21
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,856
- Watch him.
- Okay.

22
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:26,172
Damn it.

23
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:35,557
- What can I get you?
- You got coffee?

24
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,704
It's two drinks minimum.

25
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,715
Give me two coffees, extra sugar.

26
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:51,597
Access code.

27
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,987
- Special Unit, can I help you?
- Get me Pat O'Donnell please.

28
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,128
One moment, I'll transfer you.

29
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,441
Come on, Pat.

30
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:08,561
Excuse me, please, I have to pee.
Will you watch the door for me?

31
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,996
- Sure, babe.
- Thank you.

32
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,930
Don't be a creep and peek, okay?

33
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,736
- O'Donnell, here.
- Hi, Pat. This is Stone, here.

34
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,972
- Don't call me, you were just suspended.
- Did you get the report yet?

35
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,691
No, maybe the bastard
won't show this time.

36
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,255
He'll show.

37
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,711
I know he will.

38
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:34,518
I need some coffee.
Where the fuck is my coffee?

39
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:48,475
I know you're here.

40
00:08:29,484 --> 00:08:31,078
Son of a bitch.

41
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,242
Freeze! Don't move.

42
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,966
Show me your hands, man.

43
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:48,010
Somebody must have seen something.

44
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,219
You?

45
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:00,300
You know something.

46
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,900
What about you, dickhead?

47
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,006
I know.

48
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,060
I know you saw him.

49
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,256
- Where did he go?
- Don't shoot!

50
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:34,391
- Talk to me!
- I didn't see anything!

51
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:36,378
- Freeze!
- Police!

52
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,066
Get out of my way!

53
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,845
God!

54
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,798
I can hear your heartbeat.

55
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,022
I'll find you.

56
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,444
You fuck!

57
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,234
Then what?

58
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,612
He started raving like a lunatic,
out of control.

59
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,719
It took four officers to subdue him.

60
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,613
- Where is he now?
- Lockup.

61
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,858
What happened to him?

62
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,794
A serial killer murdered his
partner, Foster, three years ago.

63
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,426
He was there when it happened.

64
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:38,629
- Survivor's guilt.
- Just plain guilt.

65
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,573
Had an affair with
Foster's wife, left her...

66
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,913
...hit the booze, went over the edge.

67
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:46,664
Now he lives on anxiety,
coffee and chocolate.

68
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,932
If you ask me, he's nuts.

69
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:53,059
That's what the doctors say.
Here, read the file.

70
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,702
He's worked in every hellhole in the world
and been fired from all of them.

71
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:00,711
- They say he's the best.
- He is.

72
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:04,751
I followed him down an alleyway.
He shot a trashcan.

73
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,444
Sounds like Stone.

74
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:10,575
- Maybe you'll be a soothing influence.
- Pardon me?

75
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,300
He's your new partner.

76
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,451
What's the matter with you, Stone?

77
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:21,808
- Where's my other piece, Pat?
- You mean the cannon.

78
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:23,857
The Chief's got that.

79
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:26,449
He said he wanted to see you,
said it was urgent.

80
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:33,844
Hiya, Stone!

81
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,057
Get a move on.

82
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:50,649
- Careful, sweetheart.
- It's good to have you back.

83
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:12,645
What the fuck are you doing here?

84
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,760
I thought you were suspended.

85
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,760
Stone, get your ass in here!

86
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:51,435
- What the fuck's this?
- Hi, Chief. How are you doing?

87
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,841
Answer the question.

88
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:56,145
It's a gun.

89
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:59,116
Don't be a smart-ass. This isn't funny.

90
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,198
I'm not laughing.

91
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,080
The killer is back.

92
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,824
I thought you said
this guy wouldn't be back.

93
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,894
Sir, all research shows that a serial killer
of this type doesn't come back.

94
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,809
- Who is this?
- Detective Dick Durkin.

95
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:17,841
- Are you sure it's him?
- He ripped her heart out.

96
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:21,395
- Her heart? What for?
- Maybe he eats them for breakfast.

97
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,575
This wasn't in the police reports
or the papers.

98
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:30,232
It's never going to be. You got that?

99
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,785
Jesus, if they get wind of this,
they'll have a field day.

100
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,514
This changes things.

101
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,094
I thought we were dealing with
a psychotic, not a psychopath.

102
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,241
With such incredible strength,
he must be...

103
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:44,215
...under extreme mental distress
or on some kind of stimulant.

104
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,599
Who is this?

105
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:50,842
I'm curious. How did you know he was
going to strike at that club last night?

106
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:51,864
I didn't.

107
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,395
- But you were there before he struck.
- So?

108
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,899
That's an incredible coincidence.

109
00:13:57,766 --> 00:14:01,728
Do you know what this is?
It's a medical report on you.

110
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:08,350
The doctors say you have anxiety neurosis
to the point of being paranoid.

111
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,688
Doctors don't know shit.

112
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,894
How many weapons are you carrying,
besides this cannon?

113
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,964
- An MP-15.
- What else?

114
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,780
- A Glock 50.
- And?

115
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,821
An A-3 assault shotgun.

116
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,501
If that's not paranoid,
I don't know what the fuck is.

117
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,773
I'm surprised you don't have
a grenade launcher.

118
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,063
- I couldn't get a permit.
- This isn't funny!

119
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:39,402
- I just want to be ready.
- Ready for what?

120
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,925
You can't even find the bastard,
let alone shoot him.

121
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,370
I can find him.

122
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:46,672
If you know so much about this fella...

123
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,261
...how come we've got a corpse
with her heart ripped out?

124
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:52,268
And you're up alleyways
shooting at water rats.

125
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:57,040
- Have you been following me?
- Damn right, he has.

126
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:00,654
Paranoid people with guns
are a menace to society.

127
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,077
You'd be paranoid, too, if you had
a dipshit like this following you.

128
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,187
This dipshit happens to be
an expert on serial killers.

129
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:10,872
If he's such an expert,
what the fuck is he following me for?

130
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:16,153
You're officially off suspension.

131
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,055
But if you fuck up again...

132
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:23,356
...I'll have your arse shipped
to the worst hellhole on this planet.

133
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,213
Worse than this place?

134
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,666
And there's a condition, Stone,
my condition.

135
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:30,970
He goes with you.

136
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,408
I work alone.

137
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:36,256
You work with who I say,
or you don't work at all.

138
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:39,640
'Cause as far as I'm concerned,
you're just another crazy with a gun.

139
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,586
Your concern for my welfare is touching.

140
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,016
Get the fuck out of my office.

141
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,601
You got a pen?

142
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:01,409
Detective Dick Durkin, you got a car?

143
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,839
- Yeah, of course.
- You take yours, I'll take mine.

144
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:08,133
Hey, Stone. What's this?

145
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,987
- Are you going on a picnic?
- What, pal?

146
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,676
Having your own booze delivered now?

147
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,055
- Don't touch it! Where did you get this?
- Somebody wheeled it in.

148
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,909
- Who did?
- I don't know.

149
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,662
Did anybody see who delivered this?

150
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,454
Nobody?

151
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,984
Don't.

152
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,488
- It's cold.
- What?

153
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,378
- Cold enough to be full of beers?
- What's going on?

154
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,028
All right.

155
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:41,355
Open it.

156
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,994
Paranoid?

157
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,421
Seal off the building. Now!

158
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,203
It's too late.

159
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:05,024
Get Forensics on this.
I wanna know who delivered it and when.

160
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,781
Durkin, stick with him.

161
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:12,004
I want a mold from these teeth imprints,
and I want them now!

162
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,785
Hi.

163
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,028
Can I ask you something?

164
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,582
Where'd you get your training?

165
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:28,070
I come from Lochgilphead in Argyll,
but we moved to Glasgow when I was 4.

166
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:31,560
I got my first degree there,
then I did postgraduate in Edinburgh...

167
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,982
...and after I decided to join the police,
I went to Oxford.

168
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:38,639
Stay there.

169
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:25,246
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

170
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:27,484
What the hell are you doing here?

171
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:32,256
- I'm trying to think. Do you mind?
- You must be sick, laying in wet blood.

172
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:38,973
You saw him, didn't you? I know you did.

173
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:43,586
You can see him. I can see him.

174
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:47,428
That also means I'm not crazy.

175
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:48,805
What the hell are you doing?

176
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:54,790
Excuse me.

177
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,605
I was talking to your secretary.

178
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,049
What the hell are you doing?

179
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,338
80 percent of all accidents
are caused by poor visibility.

180
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:17,837
All units in the vicinity go to 227 Maple
to investigate a homicide.

181
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:21,711
- Stone.
- Looks as though he's struck again.

182
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:23,272
On my way.

183
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,957
Follow me, Dick!

184
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,004
Sorry.

185
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:41,986
- What floor?
- Fourth.

186
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:49,733
- What's going on?
- ID, sir.

187
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,898
Detective Dick Durkin.

188
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,620
What have you got?

189
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:02,060
What's left of a 28-year-old man.

190
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,102
His heart's been torn out.

191
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:08,457
What are you doing?
I thought you were suspended.

192
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,595
I was. You got a time of death?

193
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:16,457
It's a guess, but I'd place
the TOD somewhere around-

194
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:18,451
-6:30.
- Yes.

195
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,710
How do you know that?

196
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:39,479
Is it always like this?

197
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:44,439
It's always like this.

198
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,701
I hate rats.

199
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:59,035
Sorry about the suit.

200
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,141
Damn.

201
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,220
What is it?

202
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:23,620
It's a message for me.

203
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:27,496
- How do you know it's for you?
- This is my partner's.

204
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:33,698
What is that?

205
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,088
Looks like an astrological symbol.

206
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:41,923
It is. A symbol for Scorpio.

207
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:46,692
Inverted triangle inside a circle,
that's using the occult.

208
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,998
"25, 78." Don't know what that means.

209
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,735
- Has he ever done this before?
- No.

210
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:57,097
I wonder if he stood on the bed to paint it.

211
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,571
If he did, he shouldn't
be too hard to find.

212
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:00,332
Why?

213
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,401
He'd have to be 10 feet tall.

214
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:08,436
- What do you know about the occult?
- Nothing.

215
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,736
I thought you went to school.

216
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,837
I did, but the occult
wasn't on the curriculum.

217
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:16,047
What about this Scorpio stuff?

218
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:18,385
Are you serious?

219
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,552
- You must read your horoscope.
- Why?

220
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,698
Got a present for you, Stone.

221
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,192
Chief asked me to give you this.

222
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:29,332
It's the cast of the dentition,
from the heart this morning.

223
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,898
Take this to the lab and have it checked.

224
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:34,581
Now. You got a problem with that?

225
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:38,483
Yeah, the same problem I got with you.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

226
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,201
Bring this to the lab right now!
I don't have time for this!

227
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,948
Don't think everybody's not going
to hear about this because they are.

228
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:49,431
- What were you saying?
- A little tension between you two?

229
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:51,231
Shut up.

230
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,031
Go on.

231
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,926
Show me your face!

232
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:36,833
Foster!

233
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:41,499
Freeze!

234
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:43,739
He's a police officer! Back off!

235
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:46,016
Back!

236
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:47,516
Okay.

237
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:50,277
What happened?

238
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,045
He's out here somewhere.

239
00:24:54,439 --> 00:24:57,823
- How do you know?
- I'm telling you, he's watching.

240
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:15,084
Can I ask you a question?

241
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:19,174
What?

242
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,636
- What happened back there?
- We got close.

243
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,577
- How do you know?
- That's two questions.

244
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:34,698
How do you know what time
the second victim was killed?

245
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:41,293
Are you psychic or something?

246
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,844
- Your fucking attitude is driving me nuts.
- Word is, you are nuts.

247
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:47,281
I shouldn't have said that...

248
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:50,450
...but since we're working together,
it's best if we're honest.

249
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:55,029
We're not working together
and I'm not nuts.

250
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,407
Okay.

251
00:25:57,434 --> 00:26:00,916
Was it Paulsen that turned you in
for the report that got you suspended?

252
00:26:01,403 --> 00:26:03,608
It's just a rumor that I heard.

253
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,418
Zip up, Dick.

254
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:15,032
Are there any similarities in the victims?

255
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:18,969
You may not like me, but I'm good.
I have an Honors in Serial Homicide.

256
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,415
Terrific.

257
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:25,211
I spent a year with Behavioral Science
Division studying serial killers...

258
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:26,876
...and another year with Interpol.

259
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:30,014
I'm not some idiot
straight out of police school.

260
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,761
Did you know
Charles Manson was a Scorpio?

261
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:42,119
Before yesterday, I thought
we were dealing with a psychotic.

262
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:46,440
Then, after you told me about the hearts,
I was convinced he was a psychopath.

263
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:50,340
And seeing what he did,
I'd have to say he's both.

264
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,863
A psychotic
with a psychopathic personality.

265
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,892
There are no similarities
between the victims.

266
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:05,130
- There has to be.
- This beast doesn't care what it kills.

267
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:06,792
Why do you call him a beast?

268
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:08,936
What would you call something...

269
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,520
...with teeth like this?

270
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:40,243
- Give me your keys.
- What for?

271
00:27:40,729 --> 00:27:42,256
Give me your keys.

272
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:46,774
A present from my girlfriend.

273
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:50,384
Where are we going?

274
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,208
You're not going anywhere.

275
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:57,462
That's not fair.

276
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:35,971
Michelle?

277
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:39,523
No, King Kong.

278
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,296
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

279
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,658
I come here every time I come to London.

280
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,809
I just called you.

281
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:58,958
You did?

282
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:04,111
Your answering machine
wasn't working so I...

283
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,454
Hung up.

284
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:13,291
- You look very pretty.
- You look like shit.

285
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:17,037
Thanks.

286
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,140
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

287
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:24,692
Maybe four days ago.

288
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:30,933
His killer is still around
and I don't know if I can get him.

289
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:35,096
Then don't try.
Just give it up and walk away.

290
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:39,387
I can't.

291
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:45,401
How about just for the night?

292
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,943
Better watch your coat.

293
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,923
I've got a lot of greasy stuff.

294
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:15,485
- Is there a light?
- Right in front of you.

295
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:24,416
No wonder I couldn't find you.

296
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,662
Were you looking for me?

297
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:28,930
Yes, I was looking for you.

298
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:31,690
Could we open a window?

299
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,637
Get out of here.

300
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:40,809
Windows are broken.

301
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:43,946
I can open that door.

302
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:48,269
Thanks. That's a little better.

303
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,394
I'm sorry I disappeared.

304
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:58,767
It wasn't your fault
any more than it was mine.

305
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:01,007
That's just the way it happened.

306
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,870
When was the last time
you cleaned this place?

307
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:15,794
I don't remember.

308
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:19,607
It's good to see you.

309
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:22,584
I hear that you were suspended.

310
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:24,885
Word gets around.

311
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:28,245
No, Paulsen called.
He and Foster were close.

312
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:32,404
You still on the wagon?

313
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:35,828
- Yeah.
- Good.

314
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,309
I just brought one of the kids
from Newcastle.

315
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:43,185
- You've got kids now?
- No, I work with children.

316
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:46,419
There's a lot of kids
that need psychological help.

317
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,549
That's really nice.

318
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:53,940
- Yeah.
- Sorry about the pigeons.

319
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:56,275
I can't kill 'em.

320
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,429
How's Foster's mom?

321
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,213
The same.

322
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:08,157
- I don't think she'll ever get over it.
- Yes.

323
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:11,996
How are you?

324
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:14,580
Me? I'm crazy as ever.

325
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:19,550
I miss him.

326
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:24,893
I miss him, too.

327
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:29,539
I'll make some coffee.

328
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:32,670
Don't you have any reaI food?

329
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:37,235
It's midnight. Tide's coming up.

330
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:42,261
- Come on.
- Let's go get a beer. There's nothing here.

331
00:33:50,748 --> 00:33:52,953
Foster?

332
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:06,873
Come on.

333
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:45,993
Durkin, you're sick.

334
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,019
Freeze!

335
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:15,422
You want breakfast?

336
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:18,140
No.

337
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,222
Fine, I'll drive.

338
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:25,375
Hop in.

339
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:38,795
Are you telling me
you guys from Oxford don't eat breakfast?

340
00:36:38,894 --> 00:36:40,967
Yeah, right after I run.

341
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,503
- You what?
- Run.

342
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,487
Five miles every morning.

343
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:49,382
- What's the matter, you don't get laid?
- Yeah, every night.

344
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,860
You get laid every night,
and you run five miles every morning?

345
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,819
Yeah. Except Sundays.

346
00:36:57,332 --> 00:37:01,490
My girlfriend and I stay in bed
and fool around.

347
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,549
That's disgusting.

348
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:09,268
What is it?

349
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,696
Nothing. I need coffee.

350
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,613
What's this?

351
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:38,843
Books: paranormal psychology,
astrology, the occult.

352
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:42,838
- You read them all?
- Last night, after sex.

353
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,649
Do you mind?

354
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,367
You smoke too much,
drink too much coffee...

355
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,924
- ... and eat too much sugar.
- Helps ease the tension.

356
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:56,063
I can get rid of that.
Massage is one of my hobbies.

357
00:37:57,222 --> 00:38:00,638
That's it. Now, just relax.
Let the tension flow.

358
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,487
Listen, pal, touching
me is not a great idea.

359
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:07,298
We're cops, okay?

360
00:38:44,628 --> 00:38:46,417
- How's it going?
- Good.

361
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:50,671
Get me some breakfast, coffee.

362
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:58,092
Could I have a Lapsang Souchong
and a croissant, please?

363
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:04,912
You know,
I think you have supernatural powers.

364
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,618
- You read that in one of your books?
- Yeah.

365
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:15,639
In the Black Masque. I collect them,
it is one of my hobbies.

366
00:39:15,864 --> 00:39:19,640
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Not since I gave up drinking.

367
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,654
You quit drinking? Good for you.

368
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:25,904
What is it about you
that reminds me of my mom?

369
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:27,760
Maybe because I'm so charming.

370
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:31,152
My mom was a lot of things,
she was not charming.

371
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,683
- God, I love this job.
- Interested?

372
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:00,188
It's really good.

373
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,820
I hear you used to be a good cop.
My croissant?

374
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:04,893
What else? You got some salt?

375
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:07,133
Then you went a bit loopy.

376
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:10,430
That could be why you're psychic.

377
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,804
I just feel things, that's all.

378
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:15,175
I hate to break the news,
but that's what psychic is.

379
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,679
I think you and this killer
are on the same psychic wavelength.

380
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:38,824
What sign were you born under?

381
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:42,439
- I don't remember.
- Come on. When's your birthday?

382
00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:44,816
- November 10.
- You're a Scorpio.

383
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,141
- So what?
- That's the sign he drew on the ceiling.

384
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,453
You ever asked yourself
why he sent you the heart?

385
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:13,619
Maybe it's because he thinks
you lack compassion.

386
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:14,900
Are you trying to be funny?

387
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:25,718
Great!

388
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,302
I've been wondering...

389
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:35,036
...why he only kills during the high tide.

390
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,721
I'll bet it has something to do with the...

391
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,266
...astrological alignment of the stars
in conjunction with the new moon.

392
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:47,130
Scorpio is a water sign.

393
00:41:47,877 --> 00:41:50,049
The highest tide pulls in the new moon.

394
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:53,534
That's just off the top of my head.
You probably have a better idea.

395
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:55,108
No, I don't.

396
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:05,535
He shows up every month
on the night of the new moon...

397
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:08,577
...he kills before midnight,
in different locations...

398
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,367
...then he disappears.
We don't have a motive.

399
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,737
- We don't have a pattern.
- Slow down.

400
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:17,249
The only thing we know for sure
is that he's not a vegetarian.

401
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:25,001
Stone?

402
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:31,020
Okay, dipshit, your turn.
What do you make of all this?

403
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:39,881
I don't care about your degrees
or secondhand knowledge.

404
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:42,896
I want to know what you think. You.

405
00:42:43,957 --> 00:42:47,635
Any units in the area, report.
There's an intruder at 16 Roselle Street.

406
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:49,426
- That's-
- My place.

407
00:42:58,554 --> 00:42:59,764
My shotgun.

408
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:02,513
Call for backup. Now!

409
00:43:14,078 --> 00:43:15,288
Michelle?

410
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,909
Where is he?

411
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:52,355
If this is a joke, I don't think it's funny.

412
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:55,241
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a shower.

413
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:56,769
You're taking a shower?

414
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,877
- I heard screaming.
- The water got colder!

415
00:44:00,044 --> 00:44:02,761
- The door is open.
- I didn't open it.

416
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:08,232
Lock it!

417
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,106
- What are you doing?
- They're on their way.

418
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:17,421
She's okay.

419
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:35,120
Get back here!

420
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:49,075
Stupid son of a bitch!

421
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:52,395
I'd better find Durkin.

422
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:57,162
Stone! For Christ's sake!

423
00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:02,248
- It bit me!
- Don't worry about it.

424
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,360
- What?
- I'll get the medics.

425
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:07,051
Come on, move back!

426
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,846
Her chest was ripped open.
He must have used a hatchet.

427
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:36,534
No, he used his hands.

428
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:55,135
You saw him, didn't you?

429
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:17,567
The guy's hyperventilating.

430
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,319
Okay, come on.

431
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:24,486
I'm okay. Need some fresh air.

432
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:25,830
Give him space.

433
00:47:29,195 --> 00:47:31,585
Just calm down. Breathe in deep.

434
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:33,636
Easy, fella.

435
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:50,899
Hey, Harley!

436
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:58,958
Foster?

437
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:11,342
Jesus!

438
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,676
Foster? Come on, pal.

439
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:29,437
- Jesus.
- Stone, are you all right?

440
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,897
Dick.

441
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:37,374
- What are you doing here?
- No wonder you have panic attacks.

442
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:41,403
- That's it! That's your psychic connection.
- You're supposed to be dead.

443
00:48:41,474 --> 00:48:45,566
You've never heard of a bulletproof vest?
Man, watch out. Right.

444
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:49,699
Don't you ask me why I did that.

445
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:02,398
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

446
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,655
Did you see anything?

447
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:11,850
No, I saw a flash and then I felt the pain,
but that's all I remember.

448
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:17,770
Michelle, I'd like a word with you, please.

449
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:20,996
Catch up with you later.

450
00:49:38,195 --> 00:49:41,196
I'm sorry, it's my lighter.

451
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,975
- Where's the report from the lab?
- On your desk.

452
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:00,408
- What did you find out?
- Read the report.

453
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:02,419
What did you find out?

454
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:05,648
Traces of Leptospira interrogans.

455
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:07,932
What?

456
00:50:07,997 --> 00:50:11,227
That's the rat virus
that causes Weil's disease.

457
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:14,293
- Any fingerprints?
- Just one set.

458
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:15,774
- Did you bring them in?
- No.

459
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,425
- Why not?
- Because they were Foster's.

460
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:22,168
Your old partner, my best friend.
Do you remember him?

461
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:25,591
Get your fucking hands off me.

462
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:29,026
You want to tell me
why you turned me in for a medical?

463
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,579
- You really want to know?
- Tell me.

464
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:34,434
Not because you caused
the death of your best friend...

465
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:38,460
...not because you ran away with his wife,
not because you then dumped her...

466
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:40,541
...but because you're past it.

467
00:50:40,647 --> 00:50:43,102
You're a liability. You're a fucking menace!

468
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,636
Get your hands off him!

469
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:46,656
Relax.

470
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:49,636
Get in my office. Now!

471
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,712
You know what I just heard?

472
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,937
You came face to face with the killer
and unloaded a full clip at him.

473
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,253
The word is you missed.

474
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:13,866
- Do you know me to miss?
- You saying you hit him?

475
00:51:14,096 --> 00:51:18,124
- I didn't miss. That's what I'm saying.
- Then why the fuck isn't he dead?

476
00:51:18,194 --> 00:51:22,734
I unloaded a full clip,
450 Magnum, point blank.

477
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:26,383
It disappeared. Vanished in front of me.

478
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:29,678
You are telling me this guy is superhuman?

479
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:34,032
I don't know what he is,
sure as hell ain't like you or me.

480
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:35,725
What is it?

481
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:38,133
Genetic fingerprints
have come back from the lab.

482
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:40,021
I think you should see this.

483
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:44,847
What the hell is this?

484
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:48,020
Multiple restriction,
polymorphic DNA sequences.

485
00:51:48,282 --> 00:51:49,329
Bullshit.

486
00:51:49,402 --> 00:51:52,305
It has the DNA structure of all its victims.

487
00:51:54,204 --> 00:51:56,244
It says here it's got rat DNA.

488
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,155
It's got your DNA, too.

489
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,347
Where the hell do you think you're going?

490
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:07,097
- Durkin, stick with him.
- Yes, sir.

491
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,437
- And, Durkin...
- Sir?

492
00:52:09,953 --> 00:52:11,382
Watch your ass.

493
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:38,686
If it makes you feel any better,
those DNA reports can be wrong.

494
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:40,319
Yeah, right.

495
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:42,954
He didn't get her heart.

496
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,430
What did you say?

497
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:54,538
The last victim's heart, he didn't get it.

498
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,661
That means it's going to come back.

499
00:53:03,121 --> 00:53:04,714
Are you ready to die?

500
00:53:05,104 --> 00:53:06,054
What?

501
00:53:06,898 --> 00:53:08,589
The morgue. Come on!

502
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,299
Get lost!

503
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:14,094
Excuse me!

504
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:17,771
Out of my way, you fucks!

505
00:53:24,631 --> 00:53:26,093
He's in there.

506
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:48,310
I'll wait outside.

507
00:53:49,278 --> 00:53:51,221
Didn't think you'd buy that.

508
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:14,302
I don't like this.

509
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:53,608
Don't move or you're dead!

510
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,859
- What are you eating?
- He works here.

511
00:55:04,757 --> 00:55:06,448
- Oxford?
- Yes.

512
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,751
Sorry.

513
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:11,023
Anytime.

514
00:55:23,963 --> 00:55:25,206
What?

515
00:55:28,603 --> 00:55:29,552
Up there.

516
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,661
I'll be damned.

517
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:37,172
What's going on here?

518
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:52,759
- What do you think?
- I think he's gone.

519
00:55:53,244 --> 00:55:54,586
Yeah, right.

520
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:00,604
You got him!

521
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:05,942
I know I hit him.

522
00:56:37,385 --> 00:56:39,394
We need bigger guns, Stone.

523
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,188
That's quite a hole.

524
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:43,555
- Did you get to see him?
- Him?

525
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:46,405
That wasn't a "him. "
That was a fucking "it"!

526
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:50,339
- We've got to get bigger guns!
- Take a deep breath. Relax.

527
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,680
Okay. Come on.

528
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:04,272
We need bigger guns, big fucking guns!

529
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:06,410
Sorry.

530
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:10,921
We're getting big guns, right?
That's where we're going, to get big guns.

531
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:14,444
Stone, we need some big fucking guns!

532
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:19,661
- Another one.
- Did you see his eyes?

533
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:22,705
All I saw was this...

534
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:24,272
Drink.

535
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:28,979
...huge fucking thing.

536
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:32,848
How are you feeling?

537
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:35,577
- You okay?
- Yeah.

538
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,355
How?

539
00:57:38,523 --> 00:57:40,728
- I feel...
- On edge?

540
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:42,460
- Yeah.
- Good.

541
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:45,078
Have one of these.

542
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:53,915
- You really get laid every night?
- Yeah!

543
00:57:56,737 --> 00:57:57,948
Now what?

544
00:58:01,506 --> 00:58:03,612
We're going to get bigger guns.

545
00:58:06,468 --> 00:58:07,843
Hallelujah.

546
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:15,803
A-3, high-powered semiautomatic.

547
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:18,723
- Something bigger.
- What?

548
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,353
Does the Chief know you're down here?

549
00:58:20,424 --> 00:58:23,720
We need big guns. Big fucking guns.

550
00:58:23,785 --> 00:58:25,608
What the hell's he on?

551
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:27,779
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

552
00:58:27,979 --> 00:58:31,656
I want a grenade launcher.
High-capacity 90mm, automatic.

553
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:33,382
- Right.
- SA80.

554
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,916
These are too fucking small!

555
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:44,552
No. That's an assault shotgun,
fully automatic.

556
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:48,102
Listen, that fires 650 rounds a minute.

557
00:58:49,617 --> 00:58:51,373
What do you need two for?

558
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,159
What the fuck is this thing you're after,
a German tank?

559
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,746
No, that's a Megatron flash grenade.

560
00:58:57,812 --> 00:59:00,114
You could clear the jungle
with one of these things.

561
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:05,586
Bingo! Let's go!

562
00:59:08,662 --> 00:59:11,762
Right. I was wondering
if one of you guys would sign...

563
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:16,333
This thing, it's like the sum total
of every serial killer I've studied.

564
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:19,639
A single organism made up
of multiple DNA structures.

565
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:23,929
It's as if someone took every serial killer,
and rolled it into one incredible being.

566
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:26,898
What are you doing with those things?
Who authorized this?

567
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:28,020
Shit!

568
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:30,908
- Why didn't I think of that before?
- What?

569
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:34,270
"25, 78." 25th year, 78th cycle.

570
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:37,204
The Chinese calendar.
2008, now, this year.

571
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,994
- What are you on about?
-2008 is the year.

572
00:59:40,224 --> 00:59:42,591
- Of the rat!
- What the hell are you talking about?

573
00:59:42,657 --> 00:59:45,625
The inverted triangle is not only
a symbol of evil...

574
00:59:45,697 --> 00:59:47,191
...it also represents water.

575
00:59:47,265 --> 00:59:49,721
What have you done to him?
He's sounding like you.

576
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,763
- What about the circle?
- Circle is the sign of magic and power.

577
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:55,455
Everything inside the circle
is protected from the outside.

578
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,932
Hello!

579
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,679
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

580
00:59:59,749 --> 01:00:02,751
Scorpio is the sign most susceptible
to the powers of darkness.

581
01:00:02,823 --> 01:00:04,645
To Scorpio, the idea of being joined...

582
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:06,981
...with a supernatural being
is very important.

583
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:09,667
And the most powerful
supernatural being... Satan!

584
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:11,264
What are you on about?

585
01:00:11,337 --> 01:00:14,240
When chaos reigns,
then will the Fallen Angel prevail.

586
01:00:14,314 --> 01:00:17,129
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- Look around!

587
01:00:17,194 --> 01:00:20,676
- The world's in chaos!
- I don't believe this shit!

588
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:23,270
He's eating human hearts, for Christ's sake.

589
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,676
- How do you know?
- We had lunch with him.

590
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:28,230
Cannibals ate hearts
to gain possession of souls.

591
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:30,572
It believes that if it eats
its victims' hearts...

592
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:33,771
...it not only gains their power
and their DNA...

593
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:35,977
...it also gains their souls.

594
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,848
Are you telling me there's something
running loose in this city...

595
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:44,625
...ripping out and eating people's hearts
so he can take their souls back to hell?

596
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,722
Looks that way.

597
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,610
Hallelujah.

598
01:00:51,637 --> 01:00:53,580
You're both fucking nuts.

599
01:00:55,094 --> 01:00:56,556
What am I supposed to do?

600
01:00:56,631 --> 01:01:00,407
Put out an APB on some fucking guy
who looks like the devil?

601
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:03,507
Answers to the name of Lucifer?
Yeah, and you!

602
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,425
I suppose he's got two fucking horns
sticking out of his head!

603
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,654
Yeah, and a fucking tail!
Fucking get out of the way!

604
01:01:10,555 --> 01:01:13,403
Jesus Christ! The pair of pricks!

605
01:01:23,103 --> 01:01:24,248
Coffee?

606
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:29,437
This place is amazing.

607
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:34,142
Great bike.

608
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:37,176
Do you want some...

609
01:01:39,427 --> 01:01:40,770
...coffee?

610
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,171
Yes, please.

611
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:47,998
What have we got?

612
01:01:48,582 --> 01:01:50,471
We don't have anything.

613
01:01:50,568 --> 01:01:53,503
We're not chasing it, it's chasing us.

614
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,578
- Milk?
- Just a drop.

615
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:08,037
Don't.

616
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:19,495
This thing has really
started to piss me off.

617
01:02:28,338 --> 01:02:30,094
I think you need a plumber.

618
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:38,093
I'll cover you.

619
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:48,309
Michelle, what are you doing here?

620
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,518
In the fridge, I touched it.

621
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,946
It's all right. It's okay.

622
01:02:57,019 --> 01:02:59,191
The door was open, so I came in.

623
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,613
So you're back now.
Everything's going to be fine.

624
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:06,003
What happened?

625
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:09,882
Foster's mother killed herself.

626
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:14,139
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

627
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,782
Stay there.

628
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:30,113
The bite on her shoulder
means he's promised to it.

629
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,189
- He's got her DNA, too?
- Yeah.

630
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,405
Harley.

631
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:38,144
"Harley. " I'm working
with a guy called Harley.

632
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:40,742
You think that's funny?

633
01:03:46,313 --> 01:03:48,648
What's so great about Dick Durkin?

634
01:03:51,723 --> 01:03:53,546
Go sit in the car.

635
01:03:53,932 --> 01:03:55,655
Call me on the radio.

636
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:13,421
Which hand did you use? This one?

637
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:20,583
He's after me now, isn't he?

638
01:04:22,098 --> 01:04:23,112
No.

639
01:04:25,841 --> 01:04:27,664
He's getting desperate.

640
01:04:28,787 --> 01:04:30,249
So am I.

641
01:04:33,556 --> 01:04:34,604
Come.

642
01:04:53,114 --> 01:04:54,195
Stone.

643
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,604
Stone here. Come in.

644
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:02,872
There's something moving
at the end of the street.

645
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,073
- What is it?
- I'm just going to investigate.

646
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,086
I don't know. I'd better take a look.

647
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:11,545
One sec.

648
01:05:23,363 --> 01:05:24,793
Oxford, come in.

649
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,210
Durkin, come in.

650
01:05:36,454 --> 01:05:37,862
What's wrong?

651
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,219
I don't know. Durkin's jeep's gone.

652
01:05:42,185 --> 01:05:44,073
I'd better go take a look.

653
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:48,935
You stay here on the couch.
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

654
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:52,231
Something goes wrong, take this.

655
01:05:58,574 --> 01:05:59,752
All right?

656
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,090
Dick, come in.

657
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:06,558
Having fun?

658
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:39,681
Harley!

659
01:07:45,997 --> 01:07:47,209
Durkin!

660
01:07:56,945 --> 01:07:58,637
Stone!

661
01:07:59,185 --> 01:08:00,560
Yeah, hang on.

662
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:02,445
Got you.

663
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:05,100
Get me out of here!

664
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:17,004
What happened?
I was looking for you. You okay?

665
01:08:18,008 --> 01:08:20,343
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

666
01:08:20,632 --> 01:08:22,225
Didn't even see it.

667
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,299
What's it done to me?

668
01:08:26,714 --> 01:08:31,058
I'm going to kill that fucker. I'm going
to find it, and I'm going to kill it.

669
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:55,616
Rat bastard!

670
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:20,484
Michelle?

671
01:09:33,582 --> 01:09:35,143
What are you doing?

672
01:09:35,662 --> 01:09:38,151
There was a rat, so I shot it.

673
01:09:39,088 --> 01:09:41,390
You shot my kitchen, that's what.

674
01:09:42,032 --> 01:09:43,593
I missed the rat.

675
01:09:45,521 --> 01:09:47,048
What? This one?

676
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:49,162
Cool.

677
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,512
I'm bleeding.

678
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:01,710
Come on, pal, wake up. Get back to work.

679
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:03,954
What? What are you doing?

680
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:08,209
What's it done to me?

681
01:10:09,624 --> 01:10:11,926
See, this is his symbol.

682
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:14,999
We've been looking for a meaning.

683
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,752
What if the symbol is just a map?

684
01:10:18,683 --> 01:10:19,828
A map?

685
01:10:20,028 --> 01:10:21,654
Give me that mirror.

686
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:29,366
Fuck!

687
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:34,043
There's a circle, a
triangle, a Scorpio sign.

688
01:10:35,425 --> 01:10:38,327
- The sting in the tail.
- Let me see.

689
01:10:38,849 --> 01:10:41,239
The tail points into the River Thames.

690
01:10:42,178 --> 01:10:43,161
Doesn't make sense.

691
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:48,608
It's pointing to Cannon Street.

692
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,396
That's where Foster was killed.

693
01:10:51,621 --> 01:10:53,988
It's taking you back.
It's completing the circle.

694
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,592
If he's there, Michelle's there.

695
01:10:59,097 --> 01:11:00,242
Geometrically speaking...

696
01:11:00,313 --> 01:11:03,249
...once he kills you,
he's completed his pattern.

697
01:11:03,323 --> 01:11:05,046
Durkin, come on.

698
01:11:05,338 --> 01:11:08,918
Cannon Street Station hasn't been
used in years. It got submerged.

699
01:11:09,147 --> 01:11:12,531
I know a guy who can get us in
who lives here.

700
01:11:13,118 --> 01:11:14,678
What, is he crazy?

701
01:11:17,246 --> 01:11:19,483
You'll like him, he
catches rats for a living.

702
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,261
He missed some.

703
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:25,207
Open up! Police!

704
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,493
Where's the big guy?

705
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,345
Are there any lights in this place?

706
01:11:37,604 --> 01:11:40,572
- I think we're below the water table.
- I know.

707
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,136
I just thought I'd mention it.

708
01:11:46,055 --> 01:11:47,713
Where's your boss?

709
01:11:57,515 --> 01:11:59,555
- Who's the guy?
- What guy?

710
01:11:59,627 --> 01:12:01,319
You know it's 4:00 in the morning?

711
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:05,250
- We want to get to Cannon Street, fast.
- You can't go there. It's closed off.

712
01:12:05,324 --> 01:12:08,839
- Can you get us down there?
- You're really serious about this.

713
01:12:10,478 --> 01:12:13,195
- Got any cash?
- No, just credit cards.

714
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:15,653
Give me your watch.

715
01:12:16,848 --> 01:12:18,921
This serious enough for you?

716
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,756
The exits and entrances are all blocked off.

717
01:12:24,466 --> 01:12:27,762
We sent a couple of guys down there
a few years ago.

718
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:31,314
- What happened to them?
- They didn't come back, I guess.

719
01:12:33,364 --> 01:12:34,958
Can you get us in?

720
01:12:35,414 --> 01:12:38,316
- You don't want to go there.
- Yes, we do.

721
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,017
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

722
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:43,605
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

723
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,834
- Boy, are you pushy.
- Give me the watch.

724
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,355
You're not going to need time
where you're going.

725
01:13:11,649 --> 01:13:13,078
Get it off me.

726
01:13:13,377 --> 01:13:14,622
I hate rats.

727
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,955
They love you.

728
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:25,410
Strange boy.

729
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:27,940
He gets laid every night.

730
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:33,475
This is my little door.

731
01:13:33,543 --> 01:13:35,933
Nobody knows about this, Stone,
except you.

732
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:39,392
So don't tell anybody. This is to my den.

733
01:13:39,785 --> 01:13:41,094
This is the loo.

734
01:13:41,801 --> 01:13:43,110
This is it.

735
01:13:54,445 --> 01:13:56,650
Where does he find these people?

736
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:02,503
Hurry up, Durkin.

737
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:07,755
We're definitely
below the water table now.

738
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:09,737
He's down here.

739
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,251
This is as far as I go, guys.

740
01:14:15,028 --> 01:14:17,200
Do we need any of those keys?

741
01:14:21,813 --> 01:14:23,220
Get the keys.

742
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,286
- Thanks.
- I wish you well, guys.

743
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:33,873
Come on.

744
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:42,488
If I were a religious human being,
and not the reasoning person I think I am...

745
01:14:42,555 --> 01:14:45,851
...I wouldn't say this thing
thinks it's Satan, I'd say it is Satan.

746
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:48,316
Satan is in deep shit.

747
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:23,485
- Do you want a Rah Rah?
- No, come on.

748
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,116
I hate this place!

749
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:34,498
"Master of light,
protect us from this evil plight.

750
01:15:34,636 --> 01:15:38,760
"For lowly lives, I take my fight,
Black Masque power.

751
01:15:38,828 --> 01:15:40,106
"The rights of might... "

752
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:57,201
Don't do that again. It's not funny.

753
01:16:07,157 --> 01:16:09,711
It's out here somewhere. I can smell it.

754
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:24,057
Is it close?

755
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:26,233
It's behind us.

756
01:16:29,275 --> 01:16:30,225
Elevator.

757
01:16:50,465 --> 01:16:52,441
We can't kill it.

758
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:55,456
I'm here.

759
01:16:57,252 --> 01:16:59,936
My chest, it's burning.

760
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:02,075
Listen.

761
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:06,593
Hear the heartbeat?

762
01:17:09,414 --> 01:17:11,804
It's not yours. You understand?

763
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:18,375
Good, so let's go get it.

764
01:17:19,273 --> 01:17:20,136
Okay.

765
01:17:38,448 --> 01:17:41,448
Jesus Christ! Harley!

766
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:45,642
A circle of light. It's a circle of light!

767
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,407
Get me...

768
01:17:49,842 --> 01:17:52,462
Don't break it! Don't break the surface!

769
01:17:55,381 --> 01:17:56,690
I'm sorry.

770
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:04,244
Okay. Swing.

771
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:10,388
- Swing?
- Yeah, swing your legs up.

772
01:18:11,962 --> 01:18:13,391
Get your legs on the roof.

773
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:24,629
Come on.

774
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:31,289
Harder!

775
01:18:31,616 --> 01:18:32,564
Yes!

776
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,972
Run!

777
01:19:40,549 --> 01:19:41,694
Foster?

778
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:22,887
Get out of there!

779
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,559
Nice timing!

780
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:33,364
- Five seconds.
- Okay.

781
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,658
Four, three, two...

782
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,359
Watch this!

783
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,472
- We haven't been introduced. Dick Durkin.
- What?

784
01:21:05,214 --> 01:21:07,124
I'm gonna fry the fucker.

785
01:21:07,967 --> 01:21:09,310
Shut it off.

786
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,150
Okay, need a screwdriver.

787
01:21:13,056 --> 01:21:14,105
Move!

788
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:22,016
Gimme some slack.

789
01:21:28,036 --> 01:21:29,117
Say when.

790
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:35,168
Relax, pal.

791
01:21:38,569 --> 01:21:41,220
Get out of the water now!

792
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:43,781
- When!
- Are you sure?

793
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:46,182
- What?
- He said, "When. "

794
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:53,089
Off!

795
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,418
Please, Durkin!

796
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:13,411
Sweet dreams.

797
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:24,549
Is it dead?

798
01:23:26,152 --> 01:23:27,046
Durkin?

799
01:23:27,112 --> 01:23:30,429
That's a difficult question to answer
with a simple "yes" or "no. "

800
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,189
Philosophy of death is one of my hobbies.
Existentially...

801
01:23:33,546 --> 01:23:35,554
- Durkin!
- Tell me later.

802
01:23:35,627 --> 01:23:37,416
I'll tell you later.

803
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:03,586
Once again, the Black Masque power
prevails over evil.

804
01:24:03,651 --> 01:24:07,547
Yes, Detective Dick Durkin
and his psychic sidekick Harley Stone...

805
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,994
...can relax for a moment...

806
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,153
...before they are called forth once more
to do battle with the forces of darkness.

807
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:16,576
Shut up!
