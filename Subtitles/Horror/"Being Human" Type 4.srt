But...oh.

How long have you known?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,240
I don't know. A couple of weeks.
Pretty much since she came back.

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,960
And, for future reference,
no-one says "fancy" any more.

not pick up on any of this?

OK, so she hasn't actually told you.

Oh, wow. We are 12, aren't we?

You know, that...
that down-market version of Ritzy's.

Yeah, I know, like that's really
possible.

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,840

out of the club, but...
but she could see me.

Which is rotting.

That's why I'm so scared!

Well, of course they can see her!
She's got a body!

107
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,040
We've got to let her in.

doctors were very interested in me.

162
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,720
Wouldn't leave me alone.
Kept on prodding and poking me.

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,760
And I said, "You'd better warm
that up before you put it near me."

How can she not know she's dead?

167
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
It solves one mystery, anyway.

The mortuary suddenly
being off limits.

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
No, that was a chemical leak.
Or they were hiding a zombie.

Oh, Christ.
Are we really gonna call her that?

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, dead body moving about?

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,640
Can I just take a little step back
to point out how insane this is?

173
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,160
Mitchell, what the hell is she?
How should I know?

174
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,320
At least she's not attacking us.
Don't they usually attack people?

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,520
No, they don't usually do anything,
because they don't usually exist.

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,640
What about eating brains?

177
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,600
I don't know the rules. I know that
she can be seen and she's rotten.

178
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Mm-hm, I can vouch for that.

179
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,360
Do you think she'll continue rotting
until she's, you know, soupy?

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,160
Oh! We should take her back. Whatever
she is, she's not our problem.

181
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,960
She's the hospital's problem.

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,520
Oh, I hate to say it, but I agree.
Really?

183
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,120
Well, medically,
we can't do anything for her here.

184
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,040
If anyone can help her,
they're at the hospital.

185
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
OK, so we're all agreed.

186
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,600
Yeah, all of us but Annie.

187
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Sorry about all that earlier,
calling you a bitch and that.

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
It was out of order.

189
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
I was a bit pissed.

191
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,120
I wanted to get a bit of
Dutch courage before I went home.

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,600
Home?
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,240
I thought, you know,
bit of a drink, put on a bit of slap

194
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
and then go and
see my fella, Gethin.

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,080
He's a scrum half
for the Cardiff Blues, you know.

196
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,200
Ah, that's nice.

197
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,400
SQUELCHING

198
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,120
Anyway, um...you got a mirror?

199
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,640
Um...I don't actually
think we do, no.

200
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,560
I don't... I don't think
your friends like me much.

201
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,400
What? No! Don't be...don't be
so silly.

202
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,520
They're just like that.
Oh, it's all right.

203
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,680
Happens all the time, you know.

204
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,920
Guys get awkward, start showing off,
and the girls get jealous.

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
I get it a lot.

206
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,440
So, um...what's Mitchell's story?
Is he single?

207
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,640
No. No, he's my boyfriend.

208
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,200
Really?
Yep.

209
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Really.
Wow!

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
You did well there, didn't you?

211
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,800
Didn't I?
Annie? Do you want to...

212
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,920
Please, yes. Good.
..and I'll take over for, um...

213
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,200
She has got to go.

214
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,520
Wow! That was easy.

215
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,680
Yeah, we thought
we'd have to persuade you.

216
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,080
What with you both
being dead and all.

217
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
She may well be dead,

218
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,960
but that is pretty much all
I have in common with that...

219
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,800
that...chavalanche.

220
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,120
Great. That's settled. I'll leave
it all in your capable hands.

221
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm going back to bed.
Whoa, whoa. What?

222
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,160
Annie's invisible to normals.
You can't be seen on CCTV.

223
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,440
I think you can manage sneaking one
zombie back into a hospital.

224
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
Now, I am taking my lady friend
back to bed.

225
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,840
Good night.

226
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,000
What?
Aw.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,280
Good night. Night.

228
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,720
SHE GIGGLES

229
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Ooh.
What's that?

230
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,240
That's the tag from her toe.
It was stuck to her shoe.

231
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh.

232
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,680
SHE HUMS A TUNE

233
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,640
So, um...how are we gonna convince
her to go back to the hospital?

234
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,480
We're not.

235
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,280
Not yet.
What? Why?

236
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,520
Check out the time
and date of death.

237
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,440
Let's pay a visit to the morgue.

238
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,480
HE URINATES
Oh.

239
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Oh.

240
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Oh.

241
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,920
HE STOPS URINATING

242
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,600
TOILET FLUSHES

243
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,000
DOOR OPENS

244
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,280
Nina. Nina?

245
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,800
Mm-hm?

246
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
Is this yours?

247
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
I thought, it can't be Mitchell's
because he's a man,

248
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,240
nor Annie's cos she's dead, it can't
be Nina's cos she's on the pill.

249
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,280
You're on the pill.

250
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Why would you be needing
a pregnancy test? Are you late?

251
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,760
When were you thinking
about telling me? Look...

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,320
I was looking for the right moment.
OK, I'm not busy now. Are you busy?

253
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,960
Fine. I'm pregnant.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,720
Oh, my God. But you're on the pill.
Yes. I am.

255
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,200
But we had sex when we weren't
exactly ourselves

256
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,360
and apparently, the pill wasn't
designed with werewolves in mind.

257
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
But you know
these tests can be wrong.

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Look... Oh, I've done three tests.
I'm pregnant, George.

259
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,200
It's happening.

260
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Or rather, it's not.
I can't... I can't...

261
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,360
I can't let this go any further.

262
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,640
Um...I'm sorry.

263
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,600
OK, so, um...let me get this
straight.

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,840
If I hadn't have found this,

265
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,320
would you have just had an abortion
without telling me? No.

266
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,400
I was planning...
God. You were just going to do it.

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,960
No discussion, no nothing.
Don't you dare judge me.

268
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,720
This isn't some...
some teenage mistake, George.

269
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,000
This is a child of...monsters.

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,840
I mean, who even knows
what it could be?

271
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,360
Just the idea is terrifying.

272
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
It could be fine.

273
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,800
We're both fine! Most of the time.

274
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,600
It's my body, George.
Yeah, well, part of it isn't.

275
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Excuse me?
There is part of me in there.

276
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,480
As the father, I have as much right

277
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,920
as you to decide what
happens to our child.

278
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,560
HE HUFFS

279
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,560
I only got up for a pee!

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,080
Is that blood?

282
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
Oh, that can't be good.

283
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,640
SHE PANTS: I'm already dead.
I'm already dead. I'm already dead.

284
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,960
'I'm already dead.'

285
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,400
What's that?
Where?

286
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
There.

287
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
Hey.

288
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,720
Bingo.

289
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,160
I don't think it was just Sasha.

290
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,880
I've got four subject sheets here.

291
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,680
All came back to life
all at the same time.

292
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,320
I think they were testing them,
trying to find out what they were.

293
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
How they worked.
If it could spread.

SCREAMS ON CAMCORDER

295
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
I think they were scared.

296

'SCREAMS'

297
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,720
I know the feeling.

298
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,880
Does it say anything
about anaesthetic in there?

299
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,960
Yeah.

300
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Um...anaesthetic ineffective.

301
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,880
How did you know?
They did it anyway.

303
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,920

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,160
with them afterwards?

305
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,120
Incinerated them...

306
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,920
as a biohazard.

307
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,000
Were they still alive
when they burned them?

308
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
I don't know.

309
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, doesn't matter anyway,
does it?

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,120
Because they weren't really alive,
were they?

311
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,480
And the dead don't feel
real pain.

Funny, somehow I thought
you'd be taller,

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,880
you know, close up, like.

318
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm sorry, do I know you?

319
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,040
Oh, no. No, no, no. No. God, no.

320
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,680
No, it's just that, um...

321
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,960
well, um... it's just that
I'm like you, you know.

322
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,440
OK, all right, easy, easy.

323
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,040
So, you're a vampire? Yeah, yeah,
I am a brother of the blood.

324
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Name's Graham.
Well, Graham was my mortal name.

325
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,640
But when I was reborn to the night,
I took the name of Siddion.

326
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
Graham's fine.

327
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,840
Siddion, I don't know what I was
thinking. It's a shit name.

328
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,720
Yeah, um...all right, Graham.

329
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,320
Um...I'm kind of busy right now
so can I help you with anything?

330
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,040
Oh, God, I feel a little bit
embarrassed now,

331
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
but I am a little bit
of a fanboy.

332
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Or I could say fang boy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

333
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,480
And I was a massive
Neil Diamond fan.

334
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,520
Do you know Neil Diamond?

335
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
No, doesn't matter. But, um...
that kind of gave me the idea.

336
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
So, now I'm on a sort of pilgrimage,
you know, like a star tour,

337
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,160
and I'm visiting all the legends in
our little world, so naturally...

338
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,320
You came to see me.
Oh, my God.

339
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,520
You are up there with the greats.

340
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,160
What you did in Bristol,
it was just...

341
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,280
Remind me again. No, wait.
You don't need to be modest.

342
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,280
You got a whole chapter of vampires
to renounce blood. Amazing.

343
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
Are those boots Paul Smith?

344
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
Excuse me? Just wondering
where you got your boots.

345
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah, listen, um...Graham, I have
stuff that I really need to do, so...

346
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,360
Oh, God, yeah. No, of course.
Of course.

347
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,800
Well, it has been such a privilege
to meet you, Mitchell.

348
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,280
And, um...maybe
I could catch you again some time?

349
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.
Maybe some time.

350
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
SOFTLY: Brilliant.

351
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
CLUNK
Yaaah!

352
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,680
SHE GROANS

353
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,480
Oh.

354
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Hungover?

355
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
Yeah, yeah, just a bit.
BONES CRUNCH

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Er...where did you two
disappear to last night?

357
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,760
Oh, to the hospital.

358
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,560
We went to find out
what happened to you.

359
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,880
We know about the others
and we know about the experiments.

360
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't know what
you're talking about.

361
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,800
I think someone else
has been drinking.

362
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, look, it's OK.

363
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,120
You're not alone.

364
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,040
We're all a bit...
different in this house.

365
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,320
How do you mean?
OK.

366
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
Well...

367
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm a ghost,

368
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,000
Mitchell's a vampire, and
George and Nina are both werewolves.

369
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,600
BOTH GIGGLE

370
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,040
Fuck off!

371
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,840
Werewolves!

372
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,360
HE SNIFFS

373
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
Oh, no.

374
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm ju... I've g...

375
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,280
Mitchell, wake up.

376
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,960
She's still here.
Who?

377
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,160
Who? Who do you think? She's a
little bit mouthy, little bit dead.

378
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,600
There have been developments.

379
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,560
What kind of developments?
Um...won't be a tick.

380
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,240
Mitchell, is she still here?

381
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,800
Yeah, there's been developments.
I was asking Mitchell.

382
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,320
Can you guys keep it down?
She can hear you.

383
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,240
Oh, great. Come on in. Apparently,
we're having a house meeting.

384
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,760
Look, so...so what's changed?

385
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,960
There were others like her
at the hospital.

386
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,360
They were experimenting on them.

387
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,520
Basically, they tested them to
destruction. They burnt them up.

388
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,920
Well, look, that's
a really horrible story,

389
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,680
but is this really the best place?

390
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,720
She's got nowhere else. We do have
a spare room. This was a B&B.

391
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
Oh, what? We're a supernatural
hostel now, are we?

392
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,920
What next, a mummy?

393
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,200
Look, I have had
ghost friends before.

394
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,800
This one just happens to be
in a dead body.

395
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,280
Oh, so you're friends now, are you?
You bloody hated her last night.

396
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,240
Shh! This is not about
whether or not I like her.

397
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
This is about
trying to do the right thing.

398
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Look, she is rotting!
She smells like off meat.

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Don't be so deadist.
Excuse me?

400
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,880
It's like racist,
but for dead people.

401
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,400
Have you just spent the whole night
making up words?

402
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,760
No, I have spent the whole night
watching footage

403
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,680
of screaming people
being dissected.

404
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,480
We owe her, George.
We owe her? Why do we owe her?

405
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
She came back to life two weeks ago.

406
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,680
All of them did, when I was
on the other side. Saving me.

407
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,360
So, hang on, what are we saying?
That death's door was engaged?

408
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,080
Her spirit couldn't pass over
because of me.

409
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,120
We made her.

410
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,920
We owe her. All of us do.

411
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
Guys?

412
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,960
OK, the address
is 37, The Mount, Cyncoed CF23.

413
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
WHEELS RATTLE

414
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,600
Have you got it?

415
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Hey. Nice boots.

416
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,520
Mitchell, this is brilliant,
the two of us working together.

417
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,640
Oh, my God. I wish I had a camera.

418
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,840
Not that it would do me much good,
because we don't show up on photos.

419
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,640
Which is doubly ironic, considering
what I used to do for a living.

420
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
Go on, guess, Mitchell.

421
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,600
You can't work here.
Bingo, photographer.

422
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,480
SEAGULLS CRY

423
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,960
Hey. You gave us a bit of a scare
there, wandering off like that.

424
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
Oh, yeah, sure I did.

425
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,120
You don't have to worry about me
any more. I'm home. Do you like it?

426
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,760
It's Gethin's money but my taste.

427
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,840
This is not happening.
Cara says hello.

428
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
What did you say?

429
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,160
Yeah, she got over that whole
pretending to kill

430
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,080
and bricking her up thing.

431
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,680
You'd have to ask her, though.

432
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,200
Where is she?
Don't know.

433
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,480
She's around, though.
Digging up trouble somewhere.

434
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,520
What do you want?

435
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,720
All I want to do
is mop a few floors, Mitchell.

436
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,840
Is that too much to ask?

437
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,680
Bring it on!
BEEPING AND THUDDING

438
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Oh, and the brilliant Welshman's
dominated this round.

439
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,920
Here comes the big finish.
It's a straight right.

440
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,760
GETHIN CHATTERS
AND GAME BEEPS

441
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,840
No, no, Gethin's got him.
He's got him.

442
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,440
Gethin's gonna finish.

443
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,640
BEEPING

444
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,520
Oh, he's got him.
He's got him. He's got him again.

445
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,160
You bastard!
HE GASPS

446
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,400
This is how you do grief, is it?
Playing on your bloody video games?

447
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,080
You should be in your bed,
crying your eyes out!

448
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Um... maybe we should... Sasha!
Jesus! God! That's you, innit?

449
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,920
That's really you.

450
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,360
What's happened to you?
What's happened to you...?

451
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,360
They told me you died.
Yeah, well, plainly they were wrong.

452
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
I was suing them. They'd lost
the body. Consider it found.

453
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,760
Sasha, maybe we should... Yeah,
hang on! Did you mourn me at all?

454
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,440
Course I did, course I did!
We had a wake and everything.

455
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,640
A lovely big party.
You'd have been pleased as punch.

456
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,080
Oh. Do you still love me?

457
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
Course I do.
Mm.

458
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Stay back!
What? But it's just me, babes.

459
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,720
Don't do that. I'm just the same
as I always have been.

460
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,120
Your little pumpkin.

461
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
Get away from me!

462
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,120
Oh!
Eurgh. Eurgh.

463
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,400
Gethin!

464
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,040
Geth!

465
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,720
Shall I, um...?

466
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
SQUELCHING

467
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,800
Uh. Oh.

468
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,720
Mm.
Oh.

469
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,280
Wow.

470
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,560
Oh.

471
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,120
Right, I'm gonna just...

472
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,960
SHE GASPS

473
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
Um...we should probably go, Sasha,
cos he's bound to call the police.

474
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,360
No, he's not. What's he gonna say?
"My dead girlfriend came back..."

475
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,800
Oh, cos I am dead.

476
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,320
Aren't I? I keep saying I'm not.

477
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,840
But...oh, I can smell myself.

478
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,720
Oh, God.

479
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,920
Well, there are worse things
than being dead.

480
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,880
Just look at me. You can
be seen and heard by others.

481
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,360
And I can't.
What, you're really a ghost?

482
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,440
Yeah.

483
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,080
But you've stayed so pretty.

484
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,000
Like the dead stay pretty
in our memories.

485
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,480
You don't think of them like me.
You never picture them rotting.

486
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,720
But I can feel it happening inside
me like heat, like a compost heap.

487
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,200
And I know what happens when
things rot. They don't last.

488
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,640
No, no, you don't know that.

489
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,480
I mean, who knows
what the rules are to this?

490
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,920
I thought when I died that would be
it for everything and it wasn't.

491
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,840
And it doesn't have to be for you.

492
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,800
No, we can...we can help you
find your way. It'll be fine.

493
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,160
DOOR OPENS

494
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,680
HE SIGHS

495
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,520
Nina, I'm sorry.

496
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,760
I really wish we were normal.

497
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,080
I really wish we were having
a nice normal argument

498
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,360
about the pros and cons
of unwanted pregnancy

499
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,400
but...

500
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,680
we are not normal.

501
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,000
And maybe... It's not always
about the wolf, George.

502
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,040
So, what are you saying?

503
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,760
I've got other stuff, old stuff,
going on in my head.

504
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,000
It's...

505
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,280
SHE SIGHS:
It's not you.

506
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,960
It's not you, it's me.

507
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,040
No, it's becoming a mother

508
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,560
and, um...all that means.

509
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,360
You see, um...

510
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,240

SHE SNIFFS

514
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,040
...always reminded me that,
um, I was a mistake

515
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040
and, er...I'd ruined her life,

516
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,240
and I was worthless,
and I would never amount to anything.

517
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
She...

518
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,760
she made me hate myself.

00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,880
I'm sorry. You've...
you've never said.

520
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,920
No, there's never really a good time
to bring up that conversation.

whatever it is...

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,240
..it's a baby...

523

524

to cheer her up,

Graham was just telling me
about the time you went skiing.

552
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,600
Funny. I don't remember that at all.

553
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,120
Well, it was more
falling than skiing.

554
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,960
We spent more time that week on
our backs, with snow in our mouths,

555
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,080
than on the skis.

556
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,360
I don't remember it
because it didn't happen.

557
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,240
Yeah, he was tough back then too,
when he was training me.

558
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,560
Such a hard taskmaster. All he used
to say was, train, train, train.

559
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,520
Train, bloody train.

560
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,160
You remember that, Mitchell?
Bloody train?

561
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,680
Yes!

562
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,080
Yes, I do, now that you mention it.

563
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,760
I don't know how I forgot about
that. That's really weird.

564
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,560
We don't want to bore
Annie with that.

565
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,680
Why don't I give you the tour?
Tour?

566
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,280
Great.
We have a tour?

567
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,880

And this is the cellar!

571
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,760
You...are in my home with my friends.
That is a big no-no.

572
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,680
They could be my friends, too.
No, they couldn't!

573
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,840
And you've got a spare room.
I could move in.

574
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,680
Be nice to have Annie
down the corridor.

575
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,360
Don't you even think about it.

576
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,600
That girl, she's really
holding a torch for you.

577
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,160
And I'm thinking she doesn't know,
does she, about his greatest work.

578
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,840
About all those people
you ripped apart on that train.

The Box Tunnel 20.

580
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,040
And I think she needs to know.

581
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,600
I think she needs to know
about the real Mitchell.

582
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,760
See how she feels about him then.

583
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,080
Or we could maybe...

584
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,920
..just maybe forget
about the whole thing.

585
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Sit down, watch a bit of Wipeout.
Have a biscuit.

A bit of help here, please!

691
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,280
What's happened?
Don't know. She just collapsed.

692
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,800
Nearly there. All right, onto the
couch. What's wrong with her hands?

693

lived long enough for this to happen.

697
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,680
Her body's still decaying.

698

Maybe whatever it was
that was keeping her moving

699
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,080
just can't fight the decay any more.

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,920

OK, Mitchell.

701
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,760
I need you to go back
to the hospital

702
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,480
and borrow a little wheelchair.

For Sasha.

704
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,600
I'm gonna take her on a little jolly
to the Millennium Stadium.

705
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,760

say and I don't want to hear it.

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,360
She has as much right to live a full

709
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,200
and her condition should not
be an issue,

710
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,520

in you for even bringing it up.

Annie, it's OK.
I don't... What are you doing?

712

I don't think you want me to talk.
I don't care any more.

I never have.

..unforgivable things.

857
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,440
And I need to tell you.
No, you don't.

858
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,360
I need to do this.
No, you don't.

859
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,120
Mitchell, listen.

860
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,600
I know what you are.

861
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,760
I've known since day one.

862
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,960
But all those things you've done,
they're in your past, right?

863
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,880
It's who you are now that counts.

864
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,560
And...and what you've done for me,

865
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,520
..for George, for all of us...

866
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,360
..that's the man I know.

867
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,120
That's the man I trust.

868
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,840
And...

869
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,160
..that's the man I want.

870
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,520
Do you forgive me?

871
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,480
We need to know if the baby
will survive the transformation.

872
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,600
I've been such a bad girl.

873
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,760
You can't outrun me.
Definitely can't outfight me.

874
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,680
You can't even outlive me.

875
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,640
