1
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:22,746
After a reign of hideous terror
spanning more than a century

2
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:26,060
the king of the "undead" was
finally traced to his lair

3
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:28,538
high in the Carpathian Mountains

4
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:33,225
Through the decades, many had
sought to destroy him. All had failed.

5
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,353
Here, at last, was an
adversary armed with

6
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,263
sufficient knowledge of
the ways of the vampire

7
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,765
to bring about the final and
absolute destruction.

8
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:17,792
This then was his fate.

9
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:22,867
Thousands had been enslaved by
the obscene cult of vampirism.

10
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:26,151
Now, the fountainhead
himself perished.

11
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:30,592
Only the memory remained
of the most evil

12
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:34,834
and terrible creature who ever
set his seal on civilization.

13
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:20,006
There, there, Frau Koenig. Calm yourself.

14
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:22,083
Stay with me.

15
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:38,246
Frau Koenig. You know this
is for the best!

16
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:41,406
The risk is too great to
allow for any other way.

17
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,326
You do understand.

18
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:45,405
You must understand.

19
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:50,969
- Frau Koenig - tell me you agree.
- Hurry, Father. It'll be dark soon.

20
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:53,968
Please, Frau Koenig!

21
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:58,735
So be it. Then it must be done
without your consent!

22
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:04,528
No, you mustn't do it! You can't!
She's my daughter! My baby! No!

23
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,210
(gunshot)

24
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:22,571
Barbarians!

25
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,375
This is none of your concern!

26
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,738
Would I ride 50 km in this filthy
weather if it were none of my concern?!

27
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,294
You shame the cloth you wear.

28
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:02,421
- We can't take any chances!
- Chances? What chances?!

29
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:05,423
This child died. You understand that
"Man of God"?

30
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:07,461
She died. Nothing more!

31
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,092
- You can't be sure.
- Of course I'm sure!

32
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,420
Take her to the churchyard.
She will be buried properly.

33
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,337
- I will read no service over her.
- I will bury her.

34
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,653
Now, do as I say.

35
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:25,254
Do as I say!

36
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,503
You're out of your jurisdiction.
I'll complain to the bishop.

37
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,701
You?! And tell him that I stopped you

38
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:34,176
from performing an act of blasphemy?!
Or would you prefer that I told him?

39
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:37,299
Well... we have to be sure.

40
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,784
You are an idiot, Father.

41
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,655
Worse than that - you are a
superstitious, frightened idiot!

42
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:48,342
Take care I don't have cause
to ride this way again.

43
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,059
That's right - take it steady!

44
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,329
No time for a breather, though!

45
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,264
Very good.

46
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,025
- That's as much as I can manage.
- Very good, sir!

47
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,825
- Drinks all 'round again.
- Thank you, sir.

48
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,108
- He just bought drinks for everyone.
- I know.

49
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:33,142
- Charles is far too extravagant.
- A few shillings - we can afford it.

50
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:35,782
But that's not the point.

51
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:42,943
You've got your disapproving expression
on again, Helen. What is it this time?

52
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,753
Well, I know it's
none of my business,

53
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,985
but that was the 3rd time you
supplied everybody with drinks.

54
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,791
I know!

55
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:55,113
They don't appreciate it - they
just think you're a fool.

56
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:58,585
Helen, what I do I do
for my own satisfaction.

57
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:02,465
What about you, Alan - do you disapprove
of your younger brother's generosity?

58
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:07,311
- I gave up approving of what you do.
- There's a sensible fellow.

59
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,429
You see Helen, Alan knows
that I'm incorrigible.

60
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,457
He accepts the fact. Why don't you?

61
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,390
Foolishness is foolishness.

62
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:19,629
And now, as we all have to
get up early, I suggest we go to bed.

63
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,568
I think that's a very good idea.

64
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,877
- What can I fetch you, Father?
- Mull me some claret.

65
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,348
It's not fit for a beast
out there tonight.

66
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,738
Well, what are you all looking at?

67
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,669
Garlic - to keep out the Boogy man.

68
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,355
There is no Boogy man, and if
there was this wouldn't keep him out.

69
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:50,638
Can't you get it into your thick skulls
it's been over these past 10 years?

70
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,479
- May I warm myself by your fire?
- Of course.

71
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,550
- Charles, let him sit by the fire.
- I prefer to stand, thank you.

72
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,635
It's easier to warm
one's self this way.

73
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,316
Ah! That's better.

74
00:10:15,562 --> 00:10:19,521
Fortunately, my calling still allows
me the luxury of a warm posterior.

75
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,999
One of the few pleaures left in life.

76
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,991
You strike me as a man who
takes his pleasures seriously, Father.

77
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,081
I do, my son - indeed I do.

78
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:30,740
Pleasure in this life is important.
What are the alternatives?

79
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,633
Hellfire and brimstone.

80
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:38,082
No, I'm sure the warming of one's
backside before an open fire

81
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:42,281
and mulled claret aren't
part of the Grand Design.

82
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:46,761
No, these are earthly pleasures
we enjoy while one is able.

83
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:53,598
And what, may I ask, are four charming
English people doing in the Carpathians?

84
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:56,924
My name is Charles Kent.
This is my wife Diana,

85
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,997
my brother Alan and his wife Helen.

86
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,086
Father Sandor, Abbott of Kleinberg
at your service.

87
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,726
Please, be seated.

88
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,082
Father...

89
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:12,640
Kleinburg must be a dangerous
journey for you to go armed like this.

90
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:16,240
Another of my earthly vices.

91
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:19,208
Each time I leave the monastery,
I bring this with me.

92
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,726
The bretheren think it's a bundle of
prayer books for the heathen.

93
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm sure they truly believe

94
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,726
that the venison I bring home drops
dead by the divine Will of God.

95
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,049
- You too are hunting?
- No, no. Some climbing, some sightseeing.

96
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,722
- Travel broadens the mind.
- Admirable.

97
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:44,770
But I question your choice of locale. You
won't have your mind broadened by this lot.

98
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,925
You don't seem to have a very
high opinion of your flock.

99
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:49,844
Not mine - dear me, no.

100
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,446
I wouldn't tolerate them.

101
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:52,807
I wouldn't tolerate them!

102
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,883
You will find things very
different in Kleinberg

103
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,408
I hope you will visit us there.
You can stay at the monastery.

104
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:07,204
- The brothers will make you very welcome.
- Thank you Father - that's a fine idea.

105
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:11,691
Our programme won't allow for it.
Tomorrow, we go to Carlsbad.

106
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,568
Well, I suppose we
could change our plans.

107
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,764
I suggest that you do so.

108
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,408
It's very kind of you to invite us, but...

109
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,534
...as my wife points out, we do
have our programme to stick to.

110
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:31,268
I don't care whether you go to Kleinberg or not,
I'm just saying you shouldn't go to Carlsbad.

111
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:35,454
- I've heard it's very beautiful.
- So is a drop of belladonna.

112
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,050
Deadly nightshade.

113
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:43,092
- We're all experienced climbers, Father.
- Climbing's got nothing to do with it.

114
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:48,410
You may think me an eccentric old cleric
and not much credit to my cloth.

115
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:52,094
Perhaps I enjoy shocking
people's susceptibilities,

116
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:54,170
but I can be serious.

117
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:58,378
and when I tell you not to go
to Carlsbad, I want you to take note.

118
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,489
- Landlord?
- Yes, Father?

119
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,850
Have my horse brought 'round.

120
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,090
Well, I'm delighted to
have met you all.

121
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,291
And if you disregard my advice,
at least stay well clear of the castle.

122
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,494
Castle? But there's no castle
marked on the map.

123
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:22,028
Because it is not on the map
doesn't mean it does not exist.

124
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,562
Stay away from it.

125
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:27,095
Ladies.

126
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:34,375
- Very strange.
- The Father made a mistake.

127
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:37,217
If there was a castle,
it would be marked.

128
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:41,662
Well, right or wrong - we'll
find out tomorrow.

129
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:54,940
I don't care how much money you
give me. I ain't going to go no further.

130
00:13:54,945 --> 00:13:57,698
Don't be ridiculous. You contracted
to drive us to Carlsbad.

131
00:13:57,945 --> 00:14:00,166
You can walk. It's bare 2 kilometers.

132
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:03,582
- Walk?! You must be mad!
- You're the ones that are mad.

133
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:08,741
- Come on, man - it'll be dark soon.
- Aye, it will. That's why I'll go no further.

134
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,904
It's not our fault that you slipped
a wheel and we're 4 hours late.

135
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:14,342
I'm not saying it is. I'm just
saying I'll go no further.

136
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,784
Look. Up there. The castle.

137
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,145
- What's that place?
- What place?

138
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:24,379
- The castle.
- I don't see no castle.

139
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:26,505
That's because you're
not looking, idiot!

140
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:36,568
Alright - you've had enough
argument. Get the women out!

141
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:40,125
Now! Get 'em out!

142
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,519
You'd better do as he says.

143
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:01,701
Leave it, Charles. He's a highway
robber. He just wants our luggage.

144
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,744
I'll be back here 2 hours
after dawn tomorrow.

145
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:19,933
If any of you are here then,
I'll take you on to Carlsbad.

146
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,170
Hyah!

147
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:46,990
He wasn't a robber. We should be
grateful for small mercies.

148
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:51,832
- Why did he say he'd be back after dawn?
- He's frightened of the dark.

149
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,510
- You don't mean that.
- Of course not.

150
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:57,875
- He should be reported to the authorities.
- We're not in England now, Helen.

151
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,917
I doubt that there are any
authorities to report him to.

152
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,514
And it wouldn't help us
if there were, would it?

153
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,926
Why wouldn't he look at that place?

154
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,110
Well, Sandor was right in any event.

155
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,949
But why does everyone else deny the
existance of the place? Even the map?

156
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,078
- Maybe we could stay there.
- No - let's stay away from there.

157
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,021
I agree with you.

158
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,974
Well - there's the alternative.

159
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,353
I prefer that.

160
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:34,154
So would I.

161
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,901
Very well - let's take a look.

162
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,032
There's no driver!

163
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,275
- Can we stop it?
- We can try.

164
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,433
- Charles, be careful!
- Watch it, Charles!

165
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:14,278
Well - you're the most welcome
horses I've ever seen. Both of you.

166
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:15,719
This is a bit strange, isn't it?

167
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,172
Haven't you heard? Never look
a gift horse in the mouth.

168
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:20,512
Especially when there
are two with a coach.

169
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:24,280
- Alan's right. The whole thing is strange.
- I agree.

170
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:28,756
Well, all I can see is, we won't have
to spend the night in that hut.

171
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,560
All aboard?

172
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,923
- Alright.
- Let's see to the luggage.

173
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,887
Helen, hold the horses, will you?

174
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,136
Diana, you hold them.

175
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,525
Alright, Darling.

176
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,709
- Carlsbad?
- Carlsbad.

177
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,369
Gitup!

178
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:32,616
Whoa! Whoa! Come 'round!

179
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:34,805
They're taking the wrong road!

180
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,805
Come back! Whoa! Whoa!

181
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:42,530
- What's wrong?!
- They're going the wrong way!

182
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,894
I can't turn them!

183
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:51,134
Come back! Whoa!

184
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:53,455
Come back! Whoa! Whoa!

185
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:59,955
Alright, my beauties,
you're calling the tune!

186
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,768
He can't control them!

187
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,055
Well!

188
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,941
Let's see if your master is
as hospitable as you are.

189
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:00,015
What do you think?

190
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:03,618
I don't think they're horses at all,
but St Bernards in disguise

191
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,013
rescuing travelers who are
stranded at the crossroads.

192
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:08,857
We made enough noise arriving - you'd
think somebody would come out

193
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,657
if not to welcome us, to chase us away.

194
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:15,739
Well, it's no good standing
here debating the situation.

195
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:17,039
Let's pay our respects.

196
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,817
Ladies?

197
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:27,573
No, Charles.

198
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:32,128
Surely, it can't be as bad as
spending the night in that hut.

199
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,583
It's eerie.

200
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:38,061
Well, let's find out just how eerie.

201
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:44,558
It's open.

202
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,666
Well?

203
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,548
Hello?!

204
00:20:58,188 --> 00:21:00,188
Anybody there?!

205
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:06,368
You're right Helen - it is a bit eerie.

206
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:10,709
- I don't think we should go in.
- We've got to now. Come on!

207
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,550
Hey! Stop!

208
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,944
- What now?
- I don't know.

209
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:32,236
If you'd listened to me back at the
crossroads we wouldn't be in this state now.

210
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:34,110
If we'd listened to you, Helen,
we'd still be in England.

211
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:37,582
- Would that be bad?
- You wanted to broaden your mind!

212
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,487
I suppose you call this
educational, now?

213
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:43,246
I'm sure it would be very educational
if we knew what it was all about.

214
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:44,945
Stop it, both of you.

215
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:46,906
I'm sorry, Helen.

216
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:48,711
Look at this!

217
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:01,588
What is it, Darling?

218
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:04,190
The table is set for four persons.

219
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:09,228
Don't you see? First the coach brings us
to the castle, and now the dinner table.

220
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:11,629
We're expected.

221
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,073
- Ridiculous. How could that be?
- I don't know - but we are.

222
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:16,908
No, Alan's right, Darling.

223
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:19,848
Any moment now, four perfectly normal,
respectible people are going to

224
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:21,898
come down those stairs for dinner.

225
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:24,795
Well, if there's anybody up there,
they must be stone deaf.

226
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,149
There's one way to find out.

227
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:30,472
No!

228
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:34,671
No. We can't stay here.

229
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:36,306
We must leave this place now.

230
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,058
- Steady, Darling. It's alright.
- It isn't!

231
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:42,957
It isn't.

232
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,991
Come... sit down.

233
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,673
Charles!

234
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,875
- Charles, you mustn't go upstairs.
- He's only going to see if anyone's home.

235
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,431
I'll be back before you know it.

236
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,995
Charles!

237
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,836
It'll be alright, Helen. You'll see.

238
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,903
Hello?!

239
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,917
(knocks)

240
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,886
Alan!

241
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,491
Come up here, will you?

242
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,970
- Someone's bedroom.
- Come here.

243
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:10,691
Whose cases are these?

244
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:14,874
They're yours, aren't they?

245
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:18,394
I'm going to look next door.

246
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,855
Alan!

247
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:29,035
Our things are in there.

248
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,211
Sorry if I startled the lady, sir.

249
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,413
It was unintentional.

250
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,661
Why didn't you make your
presence known sooner?

251
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,646
I was unpacking your cases.

252
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:29,328
I trust the rooms are satisfactory.

253
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,615
Yes, admirable. But I don't
understand - none of us do.

254
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,200
My master's hospitality is renowned.

255
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,263
- But...
- If you are ready, I will serve dinner now.

256
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,177
Thank you, sir.

257
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:56,583
- I still don't understand it.
- Please, let's leave here.

258
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,976
- Dinner sounds like a splendid idea.
- I agree.

259
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:03,018
- Diana, you can't.
- But why not?

260
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:06,702
Ten minutes ago we were stranded in
the cold miles away from anywhere.

261
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:09,335
Now we're warm - we're going to be fed,

262
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:13,300
If that man's master is anything like I think
he is, we're going to be entertained as well.

263
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:15,218
Yes, Diana's right. Let's get down.

264
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:42,022
What's your name?

265
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:44,549
Klove, sir.

266
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,706
Well, Klove, isn't your master
joining us for dinner?

267
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,589
No, sir. I'm afraid not.

268
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,183
- Is he indisposed?
- He's dead.

269
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:05,020
I'm sorry if we appear a little
dense - perhaps you could explain.

270
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:08,765
- Explain, sir?
- Yes, you seem to have expected us.

271
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:13,434
This dinner, our rooms,
the carriage, everything.

272
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:18,833
Well sir, my master is dead, but
instructions were left

273
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:22,708
that the castle should always
be ready to receive guests.

274
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:28,304
- I am merely carrying out his wishes.
- I see.

275
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,831
Who was your master?

276
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:36,672
His name was Count Dracula.
An old and distinguished famlly.

277
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:41,946
That is the coat of arms,
over the fireplace.

278
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:45,066
Does no one hold the title now?

279
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,432
My master died without issue, sir...

280
00:28:47,676 --> 00:28:50,907
...in the accepted sense of the term.

281
00:28:51,156 --> 00:28:52,909
Now if you will excuse me.

282
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:03,993
The soup's delicious.

283
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:11,069
What a marvelous man he must have been,
to keep the castle always ready for travelers

284
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:14,033
- Perhaps we'll get a bill tomorrow.
- No, surely not.

285
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,712
No, no. I didn't mean it.

286
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:20,478
If only that coachman knew it, he
did us a favor when he deserted us.

287
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,798
I think it's frightening.

288
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,477
The unexplained is always
a little frightening.

289
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,670
Even you must admit,
this is preferable to

290
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:30,620
spending the night
in a woodcutter's hut.

291
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:31,635
I'm still frightened.

292
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,437
I don't know why.
I'm just frightened.

293
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:36,655
I admit it was a little
strange at first, dear,

294
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,738
but now it's all been explained.

295
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:41,759
Father Sandor tried to
warn us about this place.

296
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,432
- Helen.
- He tried to warn us!

297
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:47,596
That's because he wanted us to
go and visit him in Kleinberg.

298
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:51,398
It's my belief that we're
all extremely lucky.

299
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:54,506
Now, I think we should take advantage
of the late Count's hospitality,

300
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,826
and enjoy ourselves!

301
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:03,162
Here's to him.

302
00:30:03,524 --> 00:30:05,435
May he rest in peace.

303
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:23,963
- Count Dracula!
- Count Dracula!

304
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:43,881
- Guess who.
- Horace Peabody.

305
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:47,208
Right first time.

306
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,619
Did you enjoy your port,
cigars, and man's talk?

307
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:54,248
No, not very much, but then it
takes female company for me to...

308
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:58,363
- Who is Horace Peabody?
- An old beau of mine.

309
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,037
Before your time, Darling.

310
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,665
There was no before my time.
You were a schoolgirl in pigtails.

311
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,890
Even schoolgirls have their moments.

312
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,801
Hurry up. I'm cold.

313
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:13,128
- Is the bed comfortable?
- Not really. Lumpy.

314
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,040
Maybe you've got Horace Peabody
in there somewhere.

315
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,573
He was far too much of a gentleman.

316
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:20,259
It is lumpy.

317
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:24,291
Fine, that'll give Helen something
else to complain about.

318
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,445
Funny about Helen.

319
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:29,924
Darling, she's always the same - 2 miles
outside London and nothing is ever right.

320
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:33,085
She wasn't complaining.

321
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:37,050
She really was frightened.

322
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:40,206
- She hardly touched her dinner.
- It was a damn fine dinner, too.

323
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:44,005
Did you notice how she kept
looking over her shoulder all the time?

324
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:46,563
Klove frightened the life out of her.

325
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:50,524
He's not a particularly comforting
person to have around, I'll grant you.

326
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm glad you noticed it.
I thought it was just Helen and I.

327
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:57,854
What was it about him?

328
00:31:58,656 --> 00:32:02,359
I don't know. I suppose he's
a bit like the castle - sort of dusty.

329
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:04,374
He's not particularly clean, either.

330
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:07,893
- You suppose he cooked the dinner?
- I haven't the faintest idea, Darling.

331
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,974
The place isn't exactly
swarming with servants, is it?

332
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:21,207
(knock)

333
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:28,533
Yes, Klove?

334
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,294
Is there anything further
you or Madam require, sir?

335
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:34,576
No, thanks.

336
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:37,176
Then I wish you goodnight.

337
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,252
- He's a strange one.
- He's frightening.

338
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:50,573
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

339
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:52,932
I can't get through to any of you that

340
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:56,254
it is frightening. Everything
about this place is evil!

341
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:59,494
You're tired dear. We've all
had a most trying day.

342
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:01,221
It's not that.

343
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:05,414
This whole situation is like a bad dream.

344
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:09,213
I expect any moment to
wake up and find it didn't happen!

345
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:11,454
- Oh, Helen.
- It's true!

346
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:16,975
The worst part of it is that
I'm the only one that can see it.

347
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,862
- Oh, Alan, let's go. Please!
- Don't be ridiculous.

348
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:25,140
- I mean it!
- I know you do.

349
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:32,905
You'll forget about all of this
in the morning. You'll see.

350
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,846
There'll be no morning for us.

351
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,194
What's the matter?

352
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,351
- You called me.
- No. Go to sleep.

353
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:05,901
- You said "Helen".
- I did not.

354
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:13,496
- Something called my name.
- You dreamt it.

355
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:21,236
Alan... what is it?

356
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:01,681
Well?

357
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:05,320
- It's Klove.
- Klove?

358
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,877
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

359
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:11,962
Seems as if he was pulling
a trunk down the corridor.

360
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:14,748
- Let's find out.
- Alan!

361
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:17,319
Don't leave me.

362
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,804
I'll only be a moment.
Lock the door.

363
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:46,183
(thunder)

364
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,151
(thunder)

365
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:55,016
Madam... your husband.

366
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:58,301
Will you come quickly?

367
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,943
I'll wake the others.

368
00:47:57,754 --> 00:47:59,254
Klove?!

369
00:47:59,314 --> 00:48:00,814
Klove!

370
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:04,465
- Have you found them?
- No.

371
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,549
- All their luggage is gone.
- They must be here somewhere.

372
00:48:09,075 --> 00:48:10,952
We've looked everywhere.

373
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:18,191
- I want to leave.
- Darling, we can't leave without them.

374
00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:21,189
Please, Charles. I'm frightened.

375
00:48:25,675 --> 00:48:27,356
Alright, come on.

376
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:37,114
- No, Charles, I won't allow it.
- Darling, I've got to go back there.

377
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:40,192
At least go to the
village first and get help.

378
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:44,148
What help? As far as the villagers
are concered, that castle doesn't exist.

379
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:48,205
- Then, I'm coming with you.
- No. I want no argument.

380
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,871
You stay here, I go to the castle.
That's all there is to it!

381
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,192
Is that clear?

382
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,755
Alright.

383
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,468
It's 2:30 now.
I'll be back before 6:30.

384
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,678
- It's dark by then!
- You're not frightened of the dark.

385
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:04,954
- I am here.
- You'll be quite safe in there, Darling.

386
00:49:06,054 --> 00:49:08,192
I'll try to be back soon.

387
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,395
Take care.

388
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:20,142
Yes, of course I'll take care.

389
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:11,482
Klove?!

390
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:10,084
I hope I haven't startled you, Ma'am.

391
00:51:10,854 --> 00:51:13,233
Klove - what are you doing here?

392
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:15,135
Your husband sent me to
fetch you in the carriage, Ma'am.

393
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:18,637
- Why?
- He will explain everything to you.

394
00:54:39,315 --> 00:54:41,226
He's been waiting for you, Diana.

395
00:54:42,275 --> 00:54:43,391
He's been waiting for you.

396
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:45,510
Helen!

397
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:50,391
Where is Charles?

398
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:00,217
There's something wrong, isn't there?

399
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,997
- Where is Alan?
- Nothing's wrong.

400
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:09,196
Come, sister.

401
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:15,091
Where's Charles?

402
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:19,496
You don't need Charles.

403
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:40,196
Stop!

404
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:43,121
Let her go!

405
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:51,362
Dear Charles. Let me kiss you.

406
00:55:56,403 --> 00:55:58,903
- Charles!
- Diana! Get away!

407
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,240
Charles!

408
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,528
Diana!

409
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:04,015
Charles!

410
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:20,655
I warned you not to go
anywhere near the castle, Mr Kent.

411
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:28,136
I read about vampires years ago.

412
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:31,916
I always thought it was the product
of an over-fertile imagination.

413
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:34,504
Would that it were, Mr Kent.

414
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,671
Here in the Carpathian Mountains,
vampirism was an undisputed fact.

415
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:43,951
And the fountainhead of this
obscene cult was Dracula himself.

416
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,349
I hoped we had seen the last of him.

417
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:48,823
The last record we have of him is...

418
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:52,545
...here it is... ten years ago.

419
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,079
From what you tell me,
it was your unfortunate brother

420
01:00:57,114 --> 01:01:00,579
who provided the life force
for his resurrection.

421
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,375
Then...

422
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:08,595
...I must kill him.

423
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,673
Not kill... he is already dead.

424
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:15,194
He is "undead", Mr Kent.

425
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,348
He can be destroyed, but not killed.

426
01:01:18,956 --> 01:01:23,508
- How... destroyed?
- There are a number of ways.

427
01:01:23,877 --> 01:01:26,559
He can be traced to his resting place
during the daylight hours

428
01:01:26,594 --> 01:01:28,559
and there staked through the heart.

429
01:01:29,197 --> 01:01:32,269
He can be exposed to the
direct rays of the sun.

430
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:36,637
Running water will drown him.
The cross will burn him.

431
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,958
He is not invulnerable.

432
01:01:40,082 --> 01:01:42,582
You make it sound
comparatively simple.

433
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:47,269
To skin a cat - first catch it.

434
01:01:49,279 --> 01:01:50,712
It is not simple.

435
01:01:50,959 --> 01:01:55,476
To the contrary, it is a difficult
and dangerous undertaking.

436
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,950
You see, there are people who help him.

437
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,877
Apparently normal human beings.

438
01:01:59,912 --> 01:02:01,520
who are not vampires themselves

439
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:04,000
but who, for reasons
we don't understand

440
01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:06,118
are in his power.

441
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:09,150
This Klove is such a man - spending
his life at the castle,

442
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:11,939
waiting for such an opportunity
as you gave him last night...

443
01:02:11,974 --> 01:02:15,693
...a chance to resurrect his master.

444
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:50,509
- How is she?
- Admirable. Another 24 hours

445
01:02:50,544 --> 01:02:52,645
and she'll be as good as new.

446
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:55,150
Ludwig would like to see you, Father.

447
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:57,995
Come with me Mr Kent.
Ludwig should interest you.

448
01:02:58,246 --> 01:02:59,749
He was a traveler, like yourself.

449
01:02:59,784 --> 01:03:02,423
I found him one night
near Castle Dracula.

450
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:05,114
Something he had seen
or heard unhinged his mind.

451
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:06,989
He lost his memory completely.

452
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:10,599
We brought him here. And here he
has remained these past 12 years.

453
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:14,765
Oh, he's a contented enough soul,
and a brilliant craftsman.

454
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:29,080
- Good day, my son.
- Good day, Father.

455
01:03:29,481 --> 01:03:33,642
- What can I do to help you?
- I seek shelter for the night.

456
01:03:33,696 --> 01:03:36,927
I'm sorry, my son, but I have
orders to let no one in tonight.

457
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,069
You are welcome to rest here.

458
01:03:39,104 --> 01:03:42,293
I'll have the kitchen
send you out some food.

459
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,769
Thank you, Father.

460
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:23,521
Exquisite. Magnificent.

461
01:04:30,973 --> 01:04:35,473
Fly away, Peter. Fly away, Paul.

462
01:04:48,178 --> 01:04:50,178
Flies, Ludwig?

463
01:04:50,658 --> 01:04:54,158
A small aperitif, Father Sandor.
It will soon be dinner.

464
01:04:54,618 --> 01:04:59,090
- You wanted to see me?
- I finished the cover of the third folio.

465
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:01,375
I wanted your opinion on it.

466
01:05:07,956 --> 01:05:12,491
Is it exquisite or merely magnificent?

467
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:16,210
- Exquisite, eh, Mr Kent?
- Beautiful.

468
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,735
Good.

469
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:19,979
You may go now!

470
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:33,244
- Goodbye, Ludwig.
- Yes, I'll send for you when I want you again.

471
01:05:39,832 --> 01:05:43,047
- Why the security?
- He's a harmless enough soul,

472
01:05:43,082 --> 01:05:45,090
but he has been known to erupt.

473
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,099
Come, we have things to discuss.

474
01:06:15,107 --> 01:06:16,597
We are in agreement, then.

475
01:06:16,632 --> 01:06:18,581
As soon as your wife has
recovered sufficiently

476
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:20,221
we will send her home to England.

477
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:23,139
Then, you and I will do
what has to be done.

478
01:06:23,243 --> 01:06:26,372
We will pull that castle down
stone by stone if necessary.

479
01:06:26,407 --> 01:06:29,113
We will find him wherever he is.

480
01:06:29,148 --> 01:06:32,026
I still don't see why we
can't start immediately.

481
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:35,705
No, it is better to wait until
Mrs. Kent is safely away.

482
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:39,824
Last night Dracula was
robbed of his prey - your wife.

483
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,221
He has seen her and touched her.

484
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:44,539
He considers that she
belongs to him already.

485
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:46,303
He will want her badly.

486
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:50,379
- He won't come here?
- It is unlikely.

487
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,541
And even if he does,
he will not get in.

488
01:06:52,802 --> 01:06:56,980
What the inhabitants here don't realize
is that a vampire cannot cross a threshhold

489
01:06:57,231 --> 01:07:00,731
unless he is invited by
someone already inside.

490
01:07:01,203 --> 01:07:02,866
And if he is,

491
01:07:03,111 --> 01:07:07,101
all the garlic flowers in
the world won't keep him out.

492
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,191
Yes, master, yes.

493
01:07:55,069 --> 01:07:57,632
Darling, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

494
01:07:59,157 --> 01:08:01,432
- Are you alright?
- Yes, of course.

495
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:06,373
You're the one we
have to worry about.

496
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:09,309
The important thing is to get
you well enough to go home.

497
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:12,878
Home... that sounds marvelous.

498
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,299
When do we leave?

499
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,355
I won't be coming - not just yet.

500
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,515
Why not?

501
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,833
There's something I have to do here first.

502
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,949
Oh, Charles - you're not
going back to that castle.

503
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,540
- I have to, Darling.
- No you don't!

504
01:08:34,681 --> 01:08:37,181
Please Charles, promise
me that you won't.

505
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:43,752
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- No... now.

506
01:08:44,842 --> 01:08:48,232
- Darling.
- I'm not leaving here unless it's with you.

507
01:08:48,522 --> 01:08:52,277
Now Mrs Kent, no more talking.
It's important that you rest.

508
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:56,390
Father, you tell him. It's madness
to go back to that place.

509
01:08:59,043 --> 01:09:02,043
I think your husband is right, my dear.
We'll talk about it in the morning.

510
01:09:02,284 --> 01:09:03,876
Now, Mr Kent, please.

511
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:10,117
Diana!

512
01:09:12,885 --> 01:09:14,204
Good night.

513
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,284
Charles!

514
01:09:25,632 --> 01:09:27,529
She'll be alright in the morning.

515
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:29,786
She'll understand
what has to be done.

516
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:31,566
I hope you're right.

517
01:09:35,433 --> 01:09:38,759
I think you will find everything
you need. Goodnight, my son.

518
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:41,602
- Goodnight, Father, and thank you.
- God be with you.

519
01:10:46,429 --> 01:10:49,214
(tapping)

520
01:11:02,098 --> 01:11:03,884
Diana!

521
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:11,880
- Helen.
- Please let me in. It's cold out here.

522
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,477
So cold.

523
01:11:18,098 --> 01:11:22,098
Everything is alright now.
I got away from him.

524
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:27,973
Oh, please, Diana, let me in.
I'm freezing.

525
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,654
Darling, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

526
01:11:56,873 --> 01:11:58,700
Alright. Alright.

527
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:06,950
What happened?!
Tell me, what happened?!

528
01:12:10,511 --> 01:12:11,857
Get her down.

529
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:19,913
Hold out her hand.

530
01:12:25,911 --> 01:12:28,411
For pity's sake, enough!

531
01:12:40,644 --> 01:12:42,340
Brother Mark.

532
01:12:44,019 --> 01:12:46,519
Bring some salve and bandages.

533
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:58,267
- Well?
- We were just in time.

534
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:03,067
Are there any strangers
in the monastery?

535
01:13:03,308 --> 01:13:06,221
Only a tinker, Father. He's spending
the night outside the main gate.

536
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,815
Why wasn't I told this before?!

537
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:12,665
Spread some salve on her wrist,
bandage it and remain with her.

538
01:13:12,949 --> 01:13:16,949
Come with me, Mr Kent.
She'll be alright now. Come!

539
01:13:31,754 --> 01:13:34,666
That will prevent them from
returning here at daylight.

540
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:36,798
If we haven't caught them
by that time, they will be

541
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:40,475
exposed to the sun and destroyed.

542
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:46,574
We have caught the woman.
She was hiding in the stables.

543
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:48,300
- Dracula?
- No.

544
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,829
Take her to Ludwig's cell.

545
01:13:51,401 --> 01:13:54,996
If you wish to see the destruction
of the horror spawned by Count Dracula

546
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,858
come with me. But I warn you -

547
01:13:56,893 --> 01:14:00,115
it is not a sight for the sqeamish.

548
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:17,293
Take Ludwig out.

549
01:14:17,393 --> 01:14:20,874
Go with Father Peter, Ludwig.
It will be alright.

550
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:44,150
Now, bear in mind that this woman
is not your sister-in-law.

551
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,711
She's dead. This is a shell, and
what it contains is pure evil.

552
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:51,871
When we destroy it,
we destroy only the evil.

553
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:05,125
Mr Kent... have a look.

554
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:31,647
(Latin rites)

555
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,807
Ludwig? What are you
doing out of your room?

556
01:16:46,051 --> 01:16:48,849
My room is being used for
most important matters.

557
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,714
Father Sandor sends his
compliments, Madam.

558
01:16:50,749 --> 01:16:54,304
Would you do him the honor
of joining him in the study?

559
01:16:55,052 --> 01:16:56,869
- But...
- Everything is under control, Brother.

560
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:00,632
There's no cause for concern.

561
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:34,263
Diana!

562
01:19:35,068 --> 01:19:36,263
Diana!

563
01:20:00,027 --> 01:20:01,506
Diana!

564
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:03,306
No!

565
01:20:15,322 --> 01:20:17,691
- Horses! Quickly!
- We will go after them.

566
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:19,877
- But my wife!
- Not in panic!

567
01:20:19,912 --> 01:20:22,026
Come.

568
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:28,403
Take him back to his cell.
Come, Mr Kent.

569
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:33,760
Come along now, Ludwig.
Come along. Come with us.

570
01:20:39,071 --> 01:20:40,608
He will head for the castle.

571
01:20:40,643 --> 01:20:45,228
Once there, he will be safe,
and your wife will be lost forever.

572
01:20:45,337 --> 01:20:47,387
We must stop them
before he gets there.

573
01:20:47,636 --> 01:20:50,946
- It's more than a day's ride.
- I know. This is to our advantage.

574
01:20:50,961 --> 01:20:52,363
How?

575
01:20:52,398 --> 01:20:56,505
It will be daylight soon. Already he will
be thinking of returning to his coffin.

576
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,867
Your wife will be safe
until sunset tomorrow.

577
01:20:59,181 --> 01:21:00,471
Here.

578
01:21:01,077 --> 01:21:03,751
It would be better if you kept it.
It's your rifle. You're used to it.

579
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:08,714
No. We will not be shooting
animals, Mr Kent. Klove is a human being.

580
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,553
I may bend the laws of my office at times,
but there is a limit to what even I will do.

581
01:21:12,648 --> 01:21:17,148
Come. We must saddle the horses.
We've a hard day's ride ahead of us.

582
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:32,954
He's making for the castle.

583
01:21:33,123 --> 01:21:36,623
- Will we be in time?
- We've got to be.

584
01:22:06,675 --> 01:22:08,995
- We'll never make it!
- No.

585
01:22:09,422 --> 01:22:10,803
We'll cut across country!

586
01:22:28,721 --> 01:22:30,315
That's far enough!

587
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,562
Get down from there!

588
01:22:44,528 --> 01:22:46,028
Get out of the way!

589
01:22:50,168 --> 01:22:51,284
Come on Mr Kent!

590
01:22:52,569 --> 01:22:53,684
Hurry, Mr Kent!

591
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,566
Diana!

592
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,526
God be praised.

593
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:45,924
No! You look after her.
I'll take care of him.

594
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:48,724
You must hurry! The light's going!

595
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:11,373
It's too late, Kent!
Get away from there!

596
01:24:11,408 --> 01:24:12,873
It's too late!

597
01:24:19,605 --> 01:24:23,677
- Why don't you shoot him?
- It would do no good, my dear.

598
01:24:32,849 --> 01:24:35,439
Running water.
