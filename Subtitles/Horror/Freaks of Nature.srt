00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:21,272
The fuckbag fired my mom and every time
I see this asshole, he brings it up.

171
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,773
Come on, man.

172
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,709
Whatever. He probably
won't even recognize me.

173
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,444
RICK: Here you go, son.

174
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,779
The Malphasta Corporation
welcomes you to the Wolves.

175
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,114
Congratulations.

176
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:34,093
Hey! I know you.
You're, uh, Peg Parker's boy.

177
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,287
- Bug? Bag? Tag?
- My name's Dag.

178
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,039
- Doug. Yes, right.
- Dag.

179
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,626
Your mom was such a spark plug.
Peg Parker. What's she up to nowadays?

180
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,794
Oh, she's good. She's
just around the house.

181
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,463
Oh, how long has she been unemployed?

182
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,940
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Um, since she left the factory.

183
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,943
And why did she leave the factory again?
Wait, wait, I think I have the answer.

184
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,346
- Because I fired her.
- Yeah. You fired her.

185
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,847
She shouldn't have tried
to unionize my zombies.

186
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,307
- Yeah, can I get a uniform?
- That's the whole idea.

187
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,407
- Can I get a fucking uniform?
- (SHOUTING) Parker!

188
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,245
That was uncalled for.

189
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,266
Come here, son. I want to talk to you.

190
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:04,623

191
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,169
Come here. Listen.

192
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,780
I understand.

193
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
You know, I remember what it was like
to be in high school. It's tough.

194
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:18,846
Especially for a big, tall,
freaky motherfucker like you.

195
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,307
- I'm fine with it.
- Okay, okay.

196
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,917
- I like my body.
- All right.

197
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,502
Let me help you out. A word of advice.

198
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,338
Stop concentrating on the negative.
All right?

199
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,275
Look at the bright side.
You get to spend more time with your mom.

200
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,491
And I have a new secretary
who I have sex with.

201
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,119
- With my penis.
- (DAG GRUNTS)

202
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,456
Lots of people have sex
with their penises.

203
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,611
RICK: Seeing as how I paid for this field,

204
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,447
Coach Pulcifer asked me to come down
here today and say a few words,

205
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,466
so here I am.

206
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,138
I want you to look into the eyes of the boy
sitting next to you. Go ahead, do it.

207
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,791
And repeat after me.

208
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,352
"You are not my teammate."

209
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,020
ALL: You are not my teammate.

210
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,548
"You are not my friend."

211
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,300
ALL: You are not my friend!

212
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,386
"You are my enemy"

213
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,863
"and must be destroyed."

214
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,391
You are my enemy and must be destroyed!

215
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:21,559
Chill, dude.

216
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,496
Winners and losers, boys.
That's what makes America great.

217
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,817
Look at me. When I first came to Dillford,
the meat plant was underperforming

218
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,171
and I drove an '04 Ford Taurus.

219
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:40,761
But now the riblet is the crown jewel
of the Malphasta Corporation

220
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:45,391
- and I drive a red Porsche Boxster.
- Whoo!

221
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:50,004
How? I fired the dead weight
and brought in cheap zombie labor.

222
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:53,190
Why? Because I came here to win.

223
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,301
Out of the 25 boys seated here today

224
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:59,697
23 of you will go on to lead
completely inconsequential lives.

225
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:01,807
For the other two boys,
it'll be a different journey.

226
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,910
One of them will just drop dead
for no reason. Poof. Nobody knows why.

227
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,022
Heart attack, aneurysm,
stabbed in the heart in a mall parking lot.

228
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,373
Bang, gone.

229
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,543
But the other boy,
whoever that chosen boy is,

230
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,589
he will be a shining fucking star like me.

231
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,258
- This guy.
- He's so amazing.

232

- Strike three!

Wow. Parker's got a rocket
for an arm, huh?

234
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:28,542
Yeah. The best I've ever seen.
Too bad he's shit under pressure.

do you have any idea what's in a riblet?

00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:42,463
- Tiny ribs.
- Hormones, stimulants, tetrafluoraxipan.

305
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,566
It's a chemical compound
otherwise known as TXP.

What's so bad about TXP?

Why do you think he left the room?
It's because he doesn't want to talk.

334
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,894
Do you got a minute?

335
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:13,737
Ned, listen, I know that at times it seems
like it's awkward between you and I.

336
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,741
I'm excited that the two of us are going
to get to spend more time together.

337
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,327
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

338
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,479
Yeah. I do. I really do.

339
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,898
I mean, if you want,
you can start coming to competitions.

340
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,359
There's Mathletes on Saturday
and then there's Odyssey of the Mind.

341
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,862
And there's father-son NASA,
which I think that you would really like.

342
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,465
No, no, no. You're overthinking this.
You overthink everything.

343
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,509
Maybe just the father-son NASA.
You don't have to...

344
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,829
Look, right now
I need you down at the lot.

345
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,748
With the extra hours, if we're lucky

346
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,433
maybe Jr.'s dream of making the pros
still has a chance.

347
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,269
What about my dreams?

348
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,857
What dreams?

349
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,151
Uh, well, for starters,
I want to be an engineer someday.

350
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:57,014
Son, how many times do we have to
go over this? No one rides trains anymore!

351
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,932
You gotta stop living in the clouds
and get real.

352
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,828
If it's not the lot, you can work at the riblet
plant, be a meat bleacher like your mom.

353
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,106
I did 10 years on the ammonia hose
and I regret nothing.

354
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:10,794
I don't want to work the ammonia hose
or be a stupid freaking Hyundai salesman.

355
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,072
Whoa! Slow your roll, tiger.
Leave the Hyundai Corporation out of this.

356
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,509
Stop telling me to slow my roll!
Chaz Jr. doesn't have to slow his roll!

357
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,787
How come I'm the only one around here
who has to slow his roll?

358
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,848
Listen, I understand we're all upset
about Chaz Jr.

359
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,683
- Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Fuck Chaz Jr.?

360
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,686
- Yeah. Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Nobody fucks Chaz Jr.!

361
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,022
MRS. MOSELY: Ned, don't go! Chaz!

362
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:33,692
Don't point your finger at us!
Point it at your old friend, Dag!

363
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:37,487
He's the one who threw that pitch!
He's the one who ruined our lives!

I mean that stunt you pulled today
on the baseball field.

369

and Chaz Jr. was going to get scouted.

374
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,863
Like, impress you.

375
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,449
- Really?
- Yeah.

376
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,868
That's so sweet.

377
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,540

- What?

378
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:36,880

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,763

Yeah, all this talking about sex
is making me really hungry. So...

390
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,027
- Yeah. Me, too.
- I'm going to go to Burger King.

so understanding,

you're not understanding correctly.

Okay. Your mother and I understand
what you're saying.

how much we understand

we totally understood.

understood that much.

Lorelei was sort of a raging bitch.
