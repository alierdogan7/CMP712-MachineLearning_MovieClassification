00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:25,975
I'm not even trying to
convince you to believe me.

368
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,646
Just come to the house.

369
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:31,885
Just talk to her.

370
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,583
Will you?

371
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,385
(sighs)

372
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:36,918
Yes.

373
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:40,399
- (screams) Oh! Oh, my God!
- (raven screeching)

374
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:43,001
Oh! Oh, my God!

(doors hiss open)

379
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,546
KAT: Clearly, my mom put you up to this.

380
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,627
You can just go ahead
and tell her I'm fine.

381
00:21:56,662 --> 00:22:00,453
I'm wildly aware of the
fact that everyone thinks

382
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,862
I'm this fragile little
ornament, but I'm fine.

383
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,043
I'm dealing.

384
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:06,842
And how are you sleeping?

385
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:07,824
What?

386
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:09,911
Any bad dreams?

387
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,456
- I don't dream.
- Not ever?

388
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:13,258
No. What is this about?

389
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:17,595
(sighs)

390

house has been visited by, um...

391
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:24,686
a presence.

392
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,677

393

395

396

(exhales)

397
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,173
You know

398
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:46,353
what's going on here, right?

399
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:53,903
I liked my friend's stupid
Wiccan craft store on Facebook.

400
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:57,383
So now she thinks I'm out
drinking ram's blood or something.

401
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:00,572
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

402
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,494
- She's very worried about you.
- She's losing her mind.

403
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:05,393
You've seen my dad and what he's like?

404
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,644
Yes.

405
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,447
Last Christmas,

406
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:12,083
they were taking ballroom
dancing classes together.

407
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,696
Now she's got to check his ass

408
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:17,050
every time he goes to the bathroom.

409
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:19,591
(sighs)

410
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:21,092
Her whole life blew up,

411
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:23,655
and she's looking for somebody to blame.

412
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,377
Besides God.

413
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,885
Is that who you blame when things go wrong?

414
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,213
No.

415
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:34,137
I blame myself.

416
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,909
Because that's what you
do when you're an adult.

417
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,612
Angela, thank you very, very much.

418
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,486
Thank you. This is... It's great.

419
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:51,022
No, it's just boring old meatloaf.

420
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:53,725
Haven't made a meal in months.

421
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,933
It's really good, Mom.

422
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,458
ANGELA: Well, I kind of burnt the edges.

423
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:00,098
- Rusty.
- I like burnt edges.

424
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,330
A little gristle for the gums.

425
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,172
How's the boat, Henry?

426
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:11,876
How's that?

427
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,178
The boat... did you fix it up?

428
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:21,221
He's talking about your boat, Henry.

429
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,917
You're wasting your time.

430
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,201
- He's basically a potato.
- Kat!

431
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:28,775
Should we get dessert?

432
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:31,054
Katherine, what is wrong with you?

433
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,295
- That's your father.
- Really?

434
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,775
Does that look like Dad to you?

435
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,501
Dad? Dad?!

436
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:38,704
- Hello? Dad?
- Katherine!

437
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:53,292
TOMAS: You know, I had an
advisor back in seminary.

438
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:57,309
He was... called in to
give the last rites...

439
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,984
(clears throat)

440
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:00,395
...to a young woman in a coma.

441
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:03,161
She was brain-dead.

442
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,250
No hope of recovery.

443
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:09,155
So, he goes there, he does his thing,

444
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:11,327
but the next day, she wakes up.

445
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,857
It was a miracle.

446
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,361
That's wonderful.

447
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:17,876
But here's the thing.

448
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,344
That woman

449
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,163
could remember conversations
that took place inside her room

450
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,167
while she was in her coma,
which suggests... I don't know...

451
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:29,159
to me, anyway, that even when
the rest of the body shuts down,

452
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:32,757
there is some part of the
brain that stays aware,

453
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:35,069
knows everything that's going on.

454
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,117
So keep your damn hands out of his face.

455
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,611
(door slams)

456
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:55,494
(man laughs over TV)

457
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,850
MAN: Nice tarpon, Austin!

458
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:59,551
- MAN 2: Good job.
- MAN: Sweet!

459
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:01,671
AUSTIN: I don't want to let go!

460
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,808
MAN 2: It's done.

461
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,147
Hey, Henry,

462
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:06,668
I am taking off.

463
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:09,013
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Oh, it's...

464
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:11,881
And thanks for talking to Kat.

465

466
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,080
Yeah.

467
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,065
It's been a rough couple of months.

468
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,104
She's a good kid.

469
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,063
Yeah. She is.

470

those wonderful fund-raising letters

552

you throw straight into the trash?

553
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:05,514
I can tell you the name of every
priest from here to Massac County.

554
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:08,555
But you... oh, I've heard about you.

555
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,637
Father Tomas.

556
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:12,606
(whispers): The rising star.

557
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,097
Well, I don't know about that.

558
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,802
Uh, do you happen to know...?

559
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:19,635
The bishop speaks very highly of you.

560
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,773
Says you're exactly the sort
of man we need right now.

I'm...

565
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,852
(laughs)

566
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,041
...looking for some answers.

567
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,271
But do you have the right question?

(laughs)

569
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,221
What's the right question?

570
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,180
"What now, God?

571
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:50,921
"Give me a purpose,
point me in a direction,

572
00:32:50,956 --> 00:32:53,869
make me your divine instrument."

573
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:56,272
Once you ask Him that, you'll be surprised

574
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,723
how much the old guy has to say.

575
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:01,401
"What now, God?"

576
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,179

So why maybe come to me?

617
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,258
I had a dream.

Dreams. And...

619
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,563
It's the same dream...

620
00:35:29,618 --> 00:35:31,286

What else?

626
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,801
There was newspapers in the window,

627
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:53,662

If you were in the room, what did you see?

635
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,188

Oh, yeah.

643
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,660
Now you believe... let me guess...
that God has brought you here

644
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,765
- to my door...
- The only thing that I know

645
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,129
- is that something, somehow...
- That would be a type of

646
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,139
coincidence, Tomas.

647
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:45,933
God, for future reference, isn't
the one who works in mysterious ways.

648
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,797
You're being manipulated, my friend,

649
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:52,099
by forces you can't
even begin to understand.

650
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:57,286

653
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:02,836
Go home, Father Tomas.

654
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,102
Give your homilies, break your bread.

655
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,657
Live a long and happy life.

656
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,606
You're way out of your depth.

657
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:15,666
You're afraid.

658
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,634
Yeah. You should be, too.

659
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,736
And Jesus said,

660
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,156
"Come to me, all you who
are weary and burdened,

661
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,852
and I will give you rest."

is what you send me?

Um... I like the idea of God.

679
00:38:58,366 --> 00:38:59,999
Um, I want to believe

680
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:03,585
that good things happen for a reason,

681
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,487
and that we're not just a...

682
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,112
bunch of molecules
smashing into each other.

683
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:12,269

684
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,410
Hmm.

685
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,844
What about you?

686
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:20,506
Well, if you talk to other priests...

687
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:24,543
...they will tell you
they heard God's voice,

688
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:29,025
His... actual voice, calling them to serve.

689
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,826
I never had that.

690
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,288
Did you know I was born in Chicago?

691
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:40,289
Mm. Right down the street.

692
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,025
I did not know that.

693
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,482
When my parents separated,
Olivia, my sister...

694
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:51,047
she stayed here, and I went to... to Mexico

695
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,237
to live with my grandmother.

696
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:56,987
She would tell me all the
big plans she had for me.

697
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,611
She would say...

698
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,626
"You watch, <i>mijo.</i>

699
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:06,630

become the first Mexican pope."

"Make us all proud." Mm.

702
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,112
Mm.

703
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:13,900
It always used to bother me
that I never heard God's voice.

704
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:15,279
I would say,

705
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:17,198
maybe He never wanted
me in the first place.

706
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,633
Maybe...

707
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:24,203
Maybe I don't belong here.

708
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:33,689
I think God spoke to me today.

709
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:36,232
What did He say?

710
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:38,776
He said...

711
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:43,668

What are you doing up here?

Father Tomas killed a rat.

Whacked it with a book.

How badass is that?

A rat?

00:43:45,772 --> 00:43:47,688
We should get some traps.

Yeah.

Don't they say where
there's one, there's...

756
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:54,289
