00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,033
-Look at this room!
-No pictures except for the posters!

346
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,516
No mementos, just this!
I Iove you, Rita!

347
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,110
I cracked the code, Jeff.

348
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,758
I saw the book.

349
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,433
You're a Iiar.

350
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,752
I tried not to come.
I aImost went back home...

351
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,554
...but if I did,
I'd just pack up and go.

352
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,795
Why didn't you?

353
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,598
Because I don't know how
not to fight.

354
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,718
Nobody in my famiIy
ever fought for anything.

355
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,918
They wound up on Prozac
and sIeeping all day...

356
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,509
...or dead from Iiver disease at 35.

357
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,678
That's not gonna happen to me, Jeff.
I fight!

358
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,836
It's not her, Rita.

359
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,314
It hasn't been for a very
Iong time.

360
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,555
Then what is it?

361
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,240
It's it. It's not knowing.

362
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,550
You know what I do?
I pretend I have a choice.

363
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,634
Either to Iet her go on
Iiving wherever she is...

364
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,071
...and never know what happened...

365
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,751
...or she can be dead,
and I get to find out everything.

366
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,238
So I Iet her die.

367
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,551
I swear to God, I wish she were dead.

368
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,593
You don't know what it is Iike
to not know.

369
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,794
Shit.

370
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,753
I'm sorry.
But I don't know what to do.

371
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,148
I do.

372
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,234
JEFF: I haven't been
to the gas station since.

373
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,918
I sent the manager posters.
He put them up.

374
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,838
I never went back myseIf.

375
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,359
RITA: Then it's time you did.

376
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,114
Come on.

377
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,191

378
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,798
She's gone, Jeff. Gone.

379
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,749
You may never find out how or why.
You have to accept that.

380
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,190
If Diane were here right now...

381
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,314
...I'd ask you to marry me.
It's you I Iove, I swear.

382
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,917
But if it were possibIe
to choose right now...

383
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,431
...I'd rather be back
at this gas station...

384
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,830
...so I'd find out what happened.

385
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,873
It's not good enough.

386
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,199
If you ever wanna move on
with your Iife...

387
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,358
...if you wanna be
just aIive again...

388
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,030
...then this is your Iast chance.
I Iove you...

389
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,795
...but you must decide
to be with me, or I'm gone.

390
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,559
Let her go, Jeff.

391
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,754
Let her go.

399
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,470
My fear was that he was dead.

But there are things in this Ietter

401
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,316
Jeff, he's seen your picture
in the paper.

402
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,876
He wants to see how far you'll go.
He's Ioving this.

403
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,230
No, Iook. He signed it. Barney.

-You think that's his reaI name?
-That's not the point.

00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,079
You're right.

406
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,876
The point is, what am I doing here?
It's never gonna change.

407
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,958
It'll just go on untiI you
end up as crazy.

408
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,714

I've had.

00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,713
I can naiI this fucker!

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,111
Go to the poIice!
You can't do this on your own!

00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,313
The poIice? They Iaugh at me.
I'm a joke to them.

412
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,837
I'm starting to see their point.

413
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,190
-Don't do this to me, not now!
-Jesus Christ, you are amazing!

414
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,149
Did it occur to you that
she doesn't wanna be found?

00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,273

-I've wanted to right from the start.
-Did you rape her?

472
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,752
I'm not a rapist. It's important
that you understand that.

473
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,439
Then what did you do to her?

474
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,911
Let me tell you a story.

475
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,832
When I was 1 5,
it was an ordinary day--

476
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,113
I don't wanna hear your damn story.
I couIdn't give a shit.

477
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,590
I wanna know what happened
to her.

478
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,314
Then you'll want to Iisten
to the story.

479
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,069
You want to Iisten carefully.

480
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,192
Sometimes the deviI
is in the detaiIs.

481
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,314
Now, once, when I was 1 5...

482
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,596
...it was an ordinary day...

483
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,156
... with my ordinary home
and my ordinary life.

484
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,190
Something willed me
to the edge of the balcony.

485
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,152
I wondered if I had
the courage to jump.

486
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,032
I kept waiting for something
to stop me. Anything.

487
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,918
But nothing did.

488
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,037
And so I jumped.

489
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:37,628
Everybody has had that thought
at one time, but I did it. Why?

490
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,634
Because you're a nut case.
I wanna know where Diane is!

491
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,671
You're still not Iistening.

492
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,197
Be carefuI.
The answer will sIip by you.

493
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,628
Go on.

494
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,549
I Iead a very normaI Iife.
I work. I have a home.

495
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,512
But then, one day...

496
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,549
...on vacation with my
famiIy in CaIifornia... .

497
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,395
There's a IittIe girI in the water!

498
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,830
Hurry! She's drowning!

499
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,239
Wow!

500
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,713
BARNEY: I jumped in without thinking,
just like when I was 1 5.

501
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,195
Once again, nothing stopped me.

502
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,515
I didn 't want to save her.
I wanted to be a hero for my daughter.

503
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,757
You're the bravest man in the worId.

504
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,031
I Iove you, Daddy.

505
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,638
In that moment,
she thought I was a god.

506
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,672
That wouId make most peopIe
feeI great, but I panicked.

507
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,431
-What does this have to do with Diane?
-Diane was an experiment.

508
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,035
Saving a Iife made me a hero,
but did it make me a good person?

509
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,270
I had to prove to myseIf
beyond a doubt...

510
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,275
...that I was as capabIe of eviI
as I was of heroism.

511
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,959
ReaI eviI.

512
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,672
The worst thing. Or I wouIdn't
deserve my daughter's Iove.

513
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,678
You're fucking insane.

514
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,754
You killed Diane.

515
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,557
For me, to kill is not the worst
thing that I couId imagine.

516
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,029
There's more to know.

517
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,319
Tell me what happened.
I won't say a word.

518
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,239
You won't because if you do
you won't get what you need.

519
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,714
-Something wrong, officer?
-You have a broken taillight.

520
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,471
I don't know what to say. There's
nothing criminaI on the tape.

521
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,151
We'll conduct a search, but he has
to be missing 24 hours first.

522
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,510
Twenty-four hours? Jesus!

523
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,349
What is this? Gotta give out
parking tickets first?

524
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,913
Lynn, pIease.

525
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,951
How much have you had to drink?

526
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,516
One after another.

527
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,557
Get that taillight fixed.

528
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,115
Yes, officer. Will do. Thank you.

529
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,673
Drive safeIy.

530
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,270
-ProbIem?
-Your seat beIt.

531
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,195
-I'm cIaustrophobic.
-Just put it on.

532
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,995
Yes, sir.

533
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,273
Miss CarmichaeI? It's Rita!
Are you there?

534
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,717
PIease come to the door!
I need to taIk to you!

535
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,075
Magically deIicious.

536
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,511
Miss CarmichaeI!
Can you come to the door?

537
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,719
What's the ruckus?
You're gonna wake EIvis.

538
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,390
Great. Miss CarmichaeI,
this is very important.

539
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,318
Did you see Jeff here today?
Did you see anything unusuaI?

540
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,835
-You mean the fight with Barney?
-Yes!

541
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,996
What fight? Tell me about it.

542
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,192
Nothing to tell.

543
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,430
Your boyfriend was whopping
that man's head...

544
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,319
...got in the car with him
and drove off.

545
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,755
Oh, God!

546
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,834
Okay, what eIse?
Do you remember anything eIse?

547
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,196
Yes, come to think of it, I do.

548
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,398
-Something odd.
-What?

549
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,916
In the middIe of everything...

550
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:26,033
...that Ieprechaun popped
off my Lucky Charms box...

551
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,515
...and started dancing around.

552
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,074
"Magically deIicious! "

553
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,959
Thank you.

554
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,675
If you wanna know the Iicense pIate
number of the car, Iet me know.

555
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,519
Wait, wait, wait.

556
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,517
It's very urgent. PIease!
I'll be one minute.

557
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,713
One minute. PIease? Thanks.

558
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,117
-Sir! Sir, my car was stoIen.
-Your car was stoIen?

559
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:00,030
The Iicense pIate is 1 55INY.
I've aIready been to the poIice.

560
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,749
Mrs. Cousins? HeIene Cousins?

561
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,433
Yes... .

562
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,796
You may still have my oId address.

563
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,635
1 804 Northwest Everett Drive.

564
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,433
-SeattIe.
-New one. Thanks.

565
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,517
You gotta fill out this form.

566
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,350
I was having no success.

567
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,994
My methods needed to be rethought.

568
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,559
And then...

569
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,958
...my famiIy gave me a IittIe party
on my birthday.

570
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,552
Okay, move in.

571
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,749
Right, IittIe cIoser.

572
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,479
SmiIe!

573
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,831
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, Barney.

574
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,951
BIow out the candIes, Daddy.

575
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,235
Thank you.

576
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,754
Forever.

577
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,234
More?

578
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,640
I'm afraid to open it.

579
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,433
Let's see.

580
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,351
What happened to me?

581
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,148
-What happened, Daddy?
-You fell off the baIcony.

582
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,595
BARNEY:
And that's when it dawned on me.

583
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,599
It wasn 't the lure that had
to be stronger. I had to be weaker.

584
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,954
Excuse me.

585
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,072
I've opened mine with a barrette
a million times.

586
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,748
-This way?
-Yes.

587
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,234
BIess you.

588
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,835
Excuse me. I have to go to
the men's room. I don't feeI so well.

589
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,070
I'd given up for the day.

590
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,872
It was comicaI.

591
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,992
I didn't trust myseIf
not to Iaugh the next time.

592
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,398
Fate, Jeff.

593
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,591
If I hadn 't sneezed....

594
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,990
-I'm sorry.
-Quite all right.

595
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,670
I was just wondering
if you had five singIes.

596
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,309
Three ones.

597
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,640
Just a normaI singIe you couId trade
me for my mangIed one. Thank you.

598
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,035
CouId you--?

599
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,635
Sorry.

600
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,395
Thank you.

601
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,758
Okay, now Iet's see if this works.

602
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,720
This is your Iucky day. I can feeI it.

603
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,794
Thank you.

604
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,318
That's a beautifuI braceIet.

605
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,717
Thank you. That's the symboI
for infinity.

606
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,438
I suppose it means it'll stay forever.

607
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,915
Well, it's a nice thought.

608
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,750
My boyfriend wouId really
appreciate something Iike that.

609
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,991
Where'd you get that?

610
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,079
I rep them.

611
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,276
I handIe saIes for the
whoIe Northwest Territory.

612
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,595
Wow!

613
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,316
If you promise not to tell
the next time you're in Paris...

614
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,078
...I'll Iet you have a sampIe
for cost.

615
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,153
-They're in my car.
-Really?

616
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,233
With a new product...

617
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,996
...it's a good idea to have peopIe
seen wearing it around town.

618
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,430
-Twenty-two bucks.
-That's cheap.

619
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,509
If I toId you the markup we get for
these, you'd die. You want one?

620
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,229
Yes.

621
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,113
Right this way.

622
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,319
There they are.

623
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,989
PIease.

624
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,397
They're called "tiIes" in French?

625
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,798
That's the name of the company. Teels.

626
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,994
Un tile infinity, pIease.

627
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,795
CouId you get in and give me a hand?

628
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,949
-Get in?
-Yes.

629
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,916
[SCREAMS]

630
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,470
Why did you make contact with me?

631
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,352
Because you asked.

632
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,952
The way you searched for Diane.

633
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,310
Such a worthy opponent.

634
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,511
A kindred spirit.

635
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,151
You don't meet many men who
refuse to give up or be dominated.

636
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,154
Most just crouch frightened
in the dark.

637
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,193
Excuse me.

638
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,832
I'm Iooking for Mr. Cousins.
I saw you come out of his house.

639
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,231
I know who you are.

640
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,995
You do?

641
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,631
Yeah, I saw him watching you
this afternoon...

642
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,512
...at the restaurant.

643
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,118
Come in out of the damp.

644
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,074
I'm Rita.

645
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,199
I'm Denise.

646
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,710
Are you going to run away together?

647
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,709
Um... .

648
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,909
It's compIicated.

649
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,833
Where is he now?

650
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,997
-At the cabin.
-The cabin? I forgot.

651
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,794
Don't you wanna be together forever?

652
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,189
That's the symboI for infinity.

653
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,473
I gave it to him on a braceIet
for his birthday.

654
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,551
Look, I wanna go to him now.

655
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,355
But I'm not sure I can find my way.
It's dark.

656
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,519
Can you tell me the way?

657
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,753
Come on. You can drop me off
on the way.

658
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,108
I'm meeting a boy. Daddy has no idea.

659
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,749
Mother's asIeep. Daddy says
romance has to be secret.

660
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,075
-You won't tell him, will you?
-No, I won't tell him.

661
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,430
JEFF:
I wanna know what you did with her.

662
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,039
I'll tell you.

663
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,551
I will keep my promise.

664
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,590
But there's onIy one way to do it.

665
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,072
You must experience
what she experienced.

666
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,274
What do you mean?

667
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:54,676
Everything that happened to her,
every event from this point on...

668
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,236
...you must dupIicate exactIy.

669
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,914
You're crazy.

670
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,192
If you do, Iogic dictates
you'll find her.

671
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,469
AIive?

672
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,110
This coffee is drugged.

673
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,190
Judging from your size...

674
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,472
...it wouId take 1 5 minutes
to take effect.

675
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,638
It'll put you out
for 40 minutes or so...

676
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,954
...the same Iength of time
Diane was out.

677
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,636
You must remain unconscious
for us to move on.

678
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,679
So she's not dead?

679
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,515
Drink.

680
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,198
And afterwards, what?

681
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,713
Drink and you will experience exactIy
what she experienced.

682
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,430
You don't understand. I won't tell
anyone. I just want to know.

683
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,232
I understand.

684
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,435
And when I put myseIf in your pIace,
I beIieve you.

685
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,551
That's why I don't need a gun.

686
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,829
Your obsession is my weapon.

687
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,634
It's Iike you are my Iaboratory rat.

688
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,877
I provided the materiaIs.
You've buiIt the cage.

689
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,069
OnIy now, you can't escape
what you've constructed.

690
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,317
If you want to know
what happened to her...

691
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,158
...you have to go through
the same things.

692
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,028
The key chain,
I'd Iike to see it again.

693
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,559
Jeff, Iook at your Iife.
You have nothing. No job.

694
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,039
No money.

695
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,159
No Iove.

696
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,351
No peace of mind.

697
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,429
It's been three years of hell.

698
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:24,475
At what point do you say,
"I'm not going to be over this"?

699
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,834
There were nights with Diane I'd pray
she'd get into an accident...

700
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,952
...just so she'd Iet me
take care of her.

701
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,799
Just so she'd have to stay with me.

702
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,429
You don't care
if she's aIive or dead.

703
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,675
I do.

704
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,873
You're afraid that
you won't know who you are.

705
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,510
Who is Jeff if he's not the guy
Iooking for Diane?

706
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,113
PIease.

707
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,471
Can you waIk away
from knowing the answer?

708
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,389
PIease, I just wanna know
what happened to her.

709
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,752
Drink, Jeff, really.
What choice do you have?

710
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,750
I said I'd show you
what happened to Diane...

711
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,355
...and I'm a man of my word.

712
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,757
No!

713
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,551
HeIp!

714
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,758
Diane.

715
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,589
Oh, shit!

716
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,993
Hello, Rita.

717
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,995
I really disIike surprises.

718
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,148
Rita?

719
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,675
It's me! Come out.

720
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,030
You can't possibIy win.

721
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,112
You don't know how.

722
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,110
Your hiding is pointIess.

723
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,153
I know these woods inside and out.

724
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,638
They're Iike a maze.

725
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,873
You must come out
if you want to find Jeff!

726
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,914
That's why you came, after all.

727
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,519
Where's Jeff?

728
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,189
Where?

729
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,314
Do what you want.
You'll never know what happened.

730
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,196
If anything happens to me, all
you'll have is your same uncertainty.

731
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,318
-Your choice.
-I'll take my chances.

732
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,952
Jeff?!

733
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,559
Jeff!

734
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,555
Jeff, are you here?

735
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,153
Jeff!

736
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,953
Jeff!

737
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,353
Jeff!

738
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,555
Hello?

739
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,759
Hello?

740
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,155
Hello?

741
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,995
Operator 3 1 9. What city, please?

742
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,557
Hello? Hello?

743
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,198
FeeIing strange?

744
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,237
This is silly, Rita.

745
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,993
You can't fight.

746
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,509
No!

747
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,598
BARNEY:
How did you follow us?

748
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,518
Did you see us Ieave?

749
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,593
The important thing is that
it was all Jeff's choice.

750
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,437
Coming to the restaurant,
getting in the car...

751
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,478
...drinking the coffee.

752
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,832
He did what he wanted to do.

753
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,795
You're feeIing better, aren't you?

754
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,516
I know how Iong
the chIoroform effects Iast.

755
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,109
You'll soon be strong enough to fight.

756
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,710
Well, I'm sorry, but...

757
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,711
...I'm just not up to it.

758
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:38,999
And besides...

759
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:43,154
...I have to get home before
my wife wakes up.

760
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,590
Tell me what you did to Jeff.

761
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,795
You took your chances.

762
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,039
Is he dead?

763
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,152
I made him a cup of coffee.
It was drugged.

764
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,070
To find out what happened,
he had to go through what she did.

765
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,196
And now you must do the same.

766
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:24,869
This can be easy,
or this can be hard.

767
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,992
Your choice.

768
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,110
Don't worry. It won't keep you up.

769
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:32,478
Tell me, Mr. Cousins. Have you spoken
to your daughter tonight?

770
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,951
What? How do you know my name?

771
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,795
I know your famiIy's names, Barney.
Wife, HeIene.

772
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,558
Daughter, Denise.

773
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,508
Sweet, innocent,
1 3-year-oId daughter, Denise.

774
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:52,356
Brown hair, full of secrets.

775
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,999
I've got her.

776
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,795
What are you up to?
How were you abIe to follow us?

777
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,752
Denise knows the way.

778
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,629
I took your daughter tonight
to trade for Jeff.

779
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,035
A brave attempt,
but we both know it's not true.

780
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,274
Let's taIk about the mistress
she wants you to have.

781
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,238
Wuthering Heights.

782
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,318
Or better yet,
Iet's taIk about infinity.

783
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,314
HeIene, it's me.

784
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,911
HELENE: Is Denise with you?
Her bed hasn 't been slept in.

785
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,908
I got up to close the windows
and she wasn 't there....

786
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,591
That's right, shithead.

787
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,477
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

788
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,232
If you wanna know, you'll have
to go through what she did.

789
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,638
-Drink.
-You can't be serious.

790
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,108
Try me.

791
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,359
-If you think--
-Drink!

792
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,869
Now!

793
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,913
To your heaIth.

794
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,674
Jeff! God, hoId on!

795
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,431
Jeff, hoId on! HoId on!

796
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,158
Jeff, hoId on!

797
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,278
Oh, Jesus!

798
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,068
God, be aIive! Be aIive.

799
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,634
Be aIive!

800
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,509
Rita?

801
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,199
I've got 1 5 minutes to find her, Rita!

802
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,670
-Son of a bitch!
-Where is she?

803
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:00,758
-You killed him!
-I have no time to mess around!

804
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,475
-Get off of me! Bastard!
-Tell me where she is!

805
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,509
-Tell me where she is!
-No!

806
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,478
Where is she?

807
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,355
HeIp!

808
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,879
I've got 1 5 minutes to find her, Rita!

809
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,594
No, don't!

810
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,880
It's over. It's over.

811
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,832
You all right?

812
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,149
There was a terrific story
there before, but now...

813
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,874
...I think it's an out-and-out smash.

814
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,676
-I need for you to write it.
-I don't think so.

815
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,553
We wanna put the whoIe thing
behind us.

816
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:59,595
Look, I know I'm being gauche,
but I'm a pubIisher.

817
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:04,629
Write this book, pIease.
You won't regret it.

818
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,430
What do you say?

819
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,519
-No coffee.
-We don't drink that anymore.
