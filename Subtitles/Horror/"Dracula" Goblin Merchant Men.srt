00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:04,262
I do not need to see your offer.

00:00:04,323 --> 00:00:05,890
My interests are not for sale.

4
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,491
At any price.

5
00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:09,793
Mr. Grayson has offered me
a position in his firm.

6
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:10,961
I want you to tell me

7
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,629
everything you know
about Lord Laurent.

8
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:13,997
Everything you need to know
you can find out

9
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:16,449

at the Swinburne Club.

10
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,403
What do you want?

11
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:22,605
I presume you have no objection
to my deployment of the seers.

12
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,141
There is a vampire in London.

13
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:28,144
You shall find him forthwith.

14
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,413
He detected them
and then employed

15
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,615
some kind of countermeasure.

16
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:35,785
I will track him,
and I will destroy him.

17
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:38,454
Why engage Harker to bring
the woman into your orbit?

18
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:41,123
Surely you have the power
to simply take her.

19
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:42,791
To turn her
into as such as I am,

20
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,109
it would be an abomination.

Why am I not dead?

29
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,675
This is the price of your defiance.

Using the power of the God
you denounced,

00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:28,414

It's been over a century since
I last put fingers to keys.

38
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,979
I was thinking
about Lady Jayne Wetherby

39
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,716
and her decidedly unwholesome
avocation.

40
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,151
Really? Which one, sir?

[Chuckles]

42
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:48,423
Her vampire hunting, of course.

43
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:52,493
It stretches credulity to think
she's unaffiliated with the Order.

44
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,495
I would tend to agree, sir.

45
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,132
But then she is a female.

46
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,001
I suppose I shall have
to ascertain it

47
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,339
one way or the other.

48
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,073

59
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,153
Mother decamped for Paris
and left me on my own,

60
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:35,656

00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:47,034
do not shed a single tear

in wasting a single minute more

he turned out to be.

Not when you could be having fun
with me instead.

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,591
Dr. Murray,
I have two young relatives

70
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,427
under my charge,
sharp, young minds,

71
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:17,129
but lately they've experienced
a great, psychic strain.

72
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:21,667
I understand, in your capacity
as director of this institution,

73
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:25,236
that you've had the privilege
of serving as an alienist

74
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:28,106
to certain individuals of high renown.

75
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,509
I have treated a number
of public figures.

76
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:33,512
You understand of course
that I can't divulge...

77
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:37,348
No, no, your reputation
for discretion precedes you.

78
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,584
Which is why I'm here.

79
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:42,119
Not for myself naturally,

80
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:44,388
but for close relations

81
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,493
who wish to remain anonymous.

82
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,362
Please, how may I be of service?

83
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,830
You should be able to meet
our order

84
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:55,499
without a problem, Mr. worth.

85
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:59,536
Are you suggesting we dedicate
the entirety of our operation

86
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,971
to the needs of a single client?

87
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,339
No.

88
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:05,842
But I think he is.

89
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:10,145
Get out of my office now,
both of you.

90
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,054
Very well.
Though I must regretfully

91
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,892
inform you that your employment
here is terminated,

92

You don't have the authority
to dismiss me.

You're nothing more
than a rich man's novelty

95
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,199

into my home.

I speak with his authority.

00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:49,683
I'll give you a second chance
to do as you're told.

102
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,252
Have I made myself clear?

103
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:01,093
Yes.

00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,463
Sir.

105
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,170
In future I'd appreciate it
if you tried to earn

106
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:15,306
Mr. Grayson's trust,
not to mention generosity,

107
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,509
and I'd start by sharing
your undivided attention

108
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:19,911
during business meetings.

109
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,411
I'm sorry.
There's no excuse.

110
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,047
I provided a list of individuals

111
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,415
Mr. Grayson
would very much like you

112
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,484
to foster friendships with.

113
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm sure you recognize
most of the names on the list.

114
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:32,389
And, Harker...

115
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:36,393
Never again presume
to defend me to anyone.

00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,733
If you wish, I'd be happy
to mix a stimulant.

117
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:48,437
Now may I inquire
as to your client's name?

118
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,407
I'd rather not say.

119
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:56,111
Please, doctor,
indulge a humble academic.

120
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,318
Well, professor,
I suppose I can rely

121
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,654
on your discretion?

122
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:12,559
She is Lady Jayne Wetherby.

123
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,865
Ah.

124
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,801
I see. I see.

125
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,971
Our huntswoman is seeking
a new drug for her seers.

126
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,239
Yes.

127
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:29,843
I'm certain of it.

128
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:32,350
Give it to her.

129
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, if you insist,
I'll concoct a serum

130
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:43,255
of inadequate potency.

131
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:47,192
And force our enemy to seek
a new solution elsewhere

132
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,994

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,940
won't be worth
the paper they're written on.

of the threat he poses

140

to all of us.

141
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:07,845
So what on earth possessed you

142
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,181
to sell him your shares
in British Imperial Coolant?

143
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:11,615
Had I a choice in the matter,

144
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,960
I never would have agreed
to his terms.

00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,210

the principal oath.

If you have anything to say
to me in your defense,

149
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,500
I suggest you do so now
or stand before your brothers

150
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:34,636

00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:44,368
And what are you thinking about?

365
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:47,311
You.

366
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:50,380
You inspire me to...

367
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,783
I don't know, greater independence,
I suppose.

368
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,952
What time is it?

369
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:57,954
2:00.

370
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:01,057
We gave half the day to the night.

371
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,593
- 2:00?
- Mina, what is it?

372
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:07,197
I missed
Professor Van Helsing's class.

373
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:10,398
[Retreating footsteps]

374
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,666
Peppermint to soothe
the stomach,

375
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:15,437
willow bark to ease
the pounding in your head.

376
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:19,942
It tastes awful,
but it will work wonders.

377
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:21,744
Thank you, professor.

378
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:27,982
[Coughs]

379
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,984
Miss Murray,

380
00:30:30,018 --> 00:30:33,086
am I wasting my time with you?

381
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:38,558
There are dreams we must fight for.

382
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,594
If you want to advance
beyond the boundaries

383
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,396
society has made for you,

384
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,465
you must fight.

385
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:47,833
You're not wasting your time.

386
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:50,403
Give me a second chance,
and I will prove it to you.

387
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:01,281
Return here tomorrow morning
at 5:00 a.m. sharp.

388
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:05,049
You will report to me
as my assistant for the term.

389
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:14,426
[Electricity crackling]

390
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:27,605
The serum for Lady Jayne's seers
is ready.

391
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:36,479
We'll track their power
to its source,

392
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:39,706
and there will be a plague
upon this city.

393
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:50,694
Take this directly
to the address as written.

394
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:51,728
Don't dawdle.

395
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:54,230
If you return within an hour
with a signed receipt of delivery,

396
00:31:54,264 --> 00:31:55,865
a second shilling
will be your reward.

397
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:58,302
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

398
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,137
Yes, sir.

399
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:24,059
Is the stimulant working, sister?

400
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,761
Can you see the vampire?

401
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:36,303
I can see. It's working.

402
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:17,575
The vampire. He's with her.

403
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,526
[Gasping]

404
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:46,602
Help me.
[Gasping]

405
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,542
We've been poisoned.

406
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:08,723
I see my serum has taken hold.

407
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,826
By now you will
both be paralyzed.

408
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:19,399
Do you have any idea...

409
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,605
what it's like to hear
the screams

410
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,488
of your wife and children?

411
00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:31,378
[People screaming]

412
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:36,415
My children would be
in their 20s now.

413
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,219
The Order burned them alive
for no other reason

414
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:43,155
than to punish me
for my disobedience.

415
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:47,126
I lost everything.

416
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:57,703
The monster you seek,

417
00:34:57,737 --> 00:35:00,005
I cannot let you find him.

418
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:02,440
Not as long
as he is of use to me.

419
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,610
Until we've destroyed
the Order once and for all.

420
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:10,214
I'm afraid traces of the drug

421
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:13,584
will stay in your brain tissue
post-mortem.

422
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,287
Since I'm the only man
in Britain

423
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,892
who possesses the expertise
to process and administer

424
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:25,028
a non-lethal dose,

425
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:27,330
I would fall under suspicion.

426
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:29,232
This evidence I must destroy.

427
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:34,237
It is unfortunate, but sometimes
science requires sacrifice.

428
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,203
Don't worry. I will be quick.

429
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,410
[Knock at door]

430
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:03,051
Coming.

431
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:14,129
I'm sorry.

432
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:15,564
For everything.

433
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:18,132
It's my fault, not yours.

434
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,601
I've been stubborn and so obsessed

435
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,836
with chasing my own dreams
I never even took the time

436
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:25,273
to understand yours, and I do.

437
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:29,377
But I now realize
you don't require my protection.

438
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,011
And you are in no need of keeping.

439
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:34,414
[Chuckles]

440
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:36,349
So, if... if you could,

441
00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:39,553
just let me love you instead.

442
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:50,928
- Good evening, Miss Murray.

444
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:13,016
You've forgotten
the most important thing.

445
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,918
What?

446
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:17,287
Marry me.

447
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,892
Be my husband,
and I will be your wife.

448
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,868
I wanted to ask you
so many times.

449
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:35,371
I even bought a ring.

450
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:39,942
Wait.

451
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:47,649
May I?

452
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:18,878
[Laughter]

453
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:27,153
The oddest thing
happened to me today.

454
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:31,123
Really, sir? Just one?

455
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:33,992
I performed an act
which brought great joy

456
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:36,027
to someone other than myself.

457
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,463
Whom?

458
00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:41,400
Harker, Mina Murray.

459
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:44,336
What exactly did you do?

460
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,005
I guided the one back to the other.

461
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,340
By the looks of it, they'll be wed.

462
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,208
A good deed then.

463
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:54,111
Yes.

464
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:58,081
I should be horrified.

465
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:01,319
But in truth I can't say
I dislike this feeling.

466
00:39:01,353 --> 00:39:04,354
- And yet...
- And yet.

467
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:07,557
Keeping your employee
and Miss Murray together

468
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:10,630
keeps her in your orbit.

469
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:15,432
Like gravity.
Close but not too close.

470
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:18,968
When it might be wiser
to let her go.

471
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,706
Sometimes you're too smart
for your own good.

472
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,477
It's like a millstone around my neck.

473
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:34,850
On that first morning

474
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:37,985
when they made me what I am,

475
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:40,621
the sunlight burned my skin.

476
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,227
I don't know or why,

477
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:48,696
but I knew
I would never be the same.

478
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:53,433
What did you do?

479
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:56,457
Ripped out the throat
of the bastard priest.

480
00:39:57,672 --> 00:40:03,076
So not a bad morning,
all things considered.

481
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,345
I've had worse.

482
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,793
How can this be?

483
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:22,762
I don't know.

484
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,729
It's unprecedented.

485
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:27,098
To track the trackers...
It has never been done before.

486
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:29,901
- It's a disaster.
- Oh, it's worse than that.

487
00:40:29,935 --> 00:40:33,070
This is the work
of the vampire that I seek.

488
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:35,206
Now that the seers are dead,

489
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,076
he will much more easily
attract others of his kind.

490
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:42,212
An abomination.

491
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:45,749
Soon London will be crawling
with the vermin.
