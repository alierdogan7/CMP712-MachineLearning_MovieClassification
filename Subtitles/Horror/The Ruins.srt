1
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:45,290
Help me! Somebody help!

2
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:50,928
Somebody, help!

3
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,741
Help me!

4
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:46,452
Gin!

5
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:49,154
Read them and weep.

6
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,492
Finally!

7
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,201
- All right.
- You ready?

8
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:56,200
- War.
- War?

9
00:02:56,338 --> 00:02:57,737
We're not playing war.
War's not even a game.

10
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:00,205
- We are too playing war. Come on.
- It's total chance, Stace.

11
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:02,970
Winner picks the game, Jeff.
That's your rules.

12
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,909
Thank you, Amy.

13
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:07,037
Okay. War.

14
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,548
Okay. Who wants
a little Mexican hair of the dog?

15
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,208
<i>Señorita</i> Margarita.

16
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,253
- I'll have some.
- You'll definitely have some.

17
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:15,413
- Come on, Jeff.
- No, keep that away from me.

18
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:17,855
Well, that's not what you were saying
last night.

19
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,725
Seriously, Mr. Nude Lifeguard.
What was up with that?

20
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:24,595
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

21
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,667
One, two, three, four, I declare war.

22
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:28,201
You're burning up, honey.

23
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:30,271
- What do you mean?
- You're all red.

24
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:32,703
- No, I'm flushed. I'm just hot.
- You're not flushed.

25
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:33,866
- I finally won.
- Good.

26
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:36,375
- I knew you would.
- You did?

27
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:38,673
- Okay.
- I did. Of course I did.

28
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,777
- Shit!
- What?

29
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,879
I lost my earring.

30
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,421
Why don't you look
under the towel there?

31
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:49,581
Is it under your chair?

32
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:50,952
- Look under your towel.
- It's not.

33
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:53,560
- Under your towel.
- Why would it be under our towel?

34
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:56,426
- I don't know, I think I was...
- Did you come lay under here?

35
00:03:56,565 --> 00:04:00,365
- We're gonna find it, honey.
- It's my favorite earring.

36
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,460
It's probably in the pool.

37
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,810
I found it. It's yours, I think.

38
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:14,245
Yeah?

39
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,079
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you.

40
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,880
It's not a problem.

41
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:21,547
Hey, do you want a drink?

42
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,153
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

43
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:27,656
It's got ice in it.

44
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,263
It's okay.

45
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:30,388
It's blended.

46
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,126
- That means it has ice, Eric.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,100
- Where are you from?
- Munich, originally.

48
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:36,795
Stace, it's just ice.

49
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:40,305
No, it's not. The water system here
is contaminated with human feces.

50
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:43,843
Okay? So your drinks are, like, blended
with hepatitis B. Yes. Hepatitis B.

51
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,810
How do you know each other?

52
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:49,439
They're best friends,
and we're their boyfriends.

53
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,677
Cool.

54
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,845
How about you?
Are you here by yourself?

55
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:57,755
No, with my brother,
but he left with some girl, yeah.

56
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:00,350
Left here? Mexico or...

57
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:04,955
Oh, no, no. She's an archaeologist.
He went with her to a dig site.

58
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,364
- And what are they digging?
- Like an excavation?

59
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:10,164
Yeah, it's ruins, I think. A Mayan temple.

60
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:11,637
Kind of like the ones

61
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,970
- that nobody here wanted to go to...
- Yes, Jeff.

62
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:15,702
...the entire time that we've been here.

63
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,904
Apparently, it's not even
in the guidebooks.

64
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,571
VIP only.

65
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:22,546
Yeah. See, Jeff,
that's something I would do.

66
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:24,549
- Oh, yeah?
- Sounds like fun.

67
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:27,154
Well, if you're interested,
I'm going there tomorrow.

68
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:29,223
Heinrich was supposed to be
back by now,

69
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,917
but he must be having a good time.

70
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,563
So what do you guys think?

71
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,067
Ancient Mayan temple
off the beaten path?

72
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:45,195
I don't know,
a little culture before we leave?

73
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,067
I wanna go.

74
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,235
- You will?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,280
Since I just kicked Jeff's ass in cards,
I got nothing left to do here.

76
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,405
Wow!

77
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:57,408
Wow.

78
00:05:57,552 --> 00:05:58,883
- Wow.
- Say something.

79
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:00,079
Eric?

80
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:04,351
Well, yeah, I mean, as long as I'm back
for make-your-own-taco night, I'm in.

81
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:09,623
Amy?

82
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:17,968
Do we have to wake up early?

83
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,368
Hey, <i>malaka...</i>

84
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:28,642
You come to beach tonight? To party?

85
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:31,115
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

86
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:33,049
They are supposed to be
coming with me tomorrow,

87
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:34,485
but maybe it's a big mistake.

88
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:37,285
They're all fucking crazy in the head.

89
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:57,338
So, there was this hotel heiress
who dyed her hair blonde.

90
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:00,907
But the carpet didn't match the drapes.

91
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:03,746
So she stripped it away.

92
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:06,150
What is it? What's the joke?
What's so funny? I'm not...

93
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:07,276
You don't want to know, Mathias.

94
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,120
But the hardwood floor underneath it
was all scuffed up and dirty!

95
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:14,161
So she buffed it.

96
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:16,990
But then it was too slippery.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,525
Who's gonna dance with me?

98
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,730
Come on. Come on.

99
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:27,034
I'm just not feeling this one.

100
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,303
Jeff, buddy, we got two days left.
I wanna see some moves.

101
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:32,380
It's just like playing the trombone.

102
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:36,211
Jeff used to play the trombone
in high school.

103
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,579
- Jeffrey on the trombone, nice!
- He won a prize.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,086
Thank you for sharing that
with everybody.

105
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:44,020
Now he's gonna be a doctor.

106
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,593
And he's gonna win a prize for that.

107
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:47,990
Mathias!

108
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,563
Hey, the Greeks!

109
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,700
Hey, what's up? How are you?

110
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:56,066
Amy! Amy! No, no! No!

111
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,865
- Amy! No, no, no, no!
- Amy!

112
00:07:57,972 --> 00:07:59,906
I'll take some. I'll take some.

113
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,706
I have her.

114
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:11,779
Amy, it's time to go to bed. Let's go.

115
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,117
No, I don't want to.

116
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,587
Come on.

117
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:22,354
All right, I'm calling it a night, guys.

118
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:25,433
- Good night. Give me a kiss.
- Come here.

119
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,761
- Give me a kiss.
- Stay.

120
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,095
- See you, buddy!
- Make sure she gets home.

121
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:29,601
- Night, Jeff!
- Okay?

122
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:32,102
- I'll see you guys tomorrow morning.
- All right.

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,298
- Yeah.
- Be good, man.

124
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:35,932
- My boyfriend, the rock star!
- See you, Ame.

125
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:40,406
- Matteo!
- Mathias.

126
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:41,709
Mathias.

127
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,309
Show me a German dance. Come on.

128
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:47,114
You want a German dance?

129
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:48,950
Like a waltz?

130
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,081
- Come on!
- Yeah...

131
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:52,284
Drag you?

132
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:53,621
Nobody wants to dance!

133
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:56,322
- You want me to dance? I can't dance.
- It's so beautiful!

134
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,728
So, how much you wanna bet
she kisses him?

135
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:03,429
She's freaking out 'cause Jeff's med
school is like 2,000 miles away, okay?

136
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,996
- You do a twirl.
- Okay, how much?

137
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:08,302
- She's not gonna kiss him.
- That's nice.

138
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,138
- Yeah, it's good, yeah?
- Yeah, how do you do that?

139
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,973
All right, you know what?

140
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:15,810
Oral sex. Winner receives.

141
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,248
Oral sex. Okay.

142
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:21,754
- All right, more of the hips.
- Use the hips. Like this.

143
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:30,521
Jeff's a nice guy, yeah.

144
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:33,759
Come here. Come here.
I wanna tell you a secret.

145
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:37,827
Amy!

146
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,133
Amy!

147
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,537
- Yes!
- Amy!

148
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,637
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

149
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:45,713
I will dance with you, okay?

150
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:05,755
Crazy Greeks.

151
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,994
No. The place that they went, here.

152
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:12,436
It's only on this old map.
It's gone from the guidebook.

153
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,209
What are you doing?

154
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:24,342
He's making a copy of the map from
the girl Heinrich met, for his friends.

155
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:28,047
Yes, your friends look like
they could use a map.

156
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,215
All right. Give me a couple of minutes?

157
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,451
- Rally the troops?
- Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:33,117
- Half an hour in the lobby?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:34,888
- Okay.
- All right.

160
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:45,204
Do you know
what they do to people down here

161
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,796
who don't honor their bets?

162
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:48,238
Bus leaves in like 15 minutes.

163
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:49,935
They smash their hands.

164
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,574
No, they do. They take broomsticks,

165
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,580
and they just like, whack,
smash their hands.

166
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:56,616
I mean, it's a true story.
It's kind of brutal, but it happens.

167
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:58,116
What are you gonna do?

168
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,619
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on!

169
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:03,087
Come on! Jeff's gonna be pissed
if we miss it.

170
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:05,386
The terrible wrath of Jeff,

171
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,087
followed, I'm sure, by the even more
frightening whining of Amy.

172
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:09,424
She's not that bad.

173
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,296
No, but I bet she's feeling pretty
awkward right about now, don't you?

174
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:16,263
Don't say anything.

175
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,963
I mean it. Not a word.

176
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:19,130
- Come here.
- Come on!

177
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:22,266
Look, be a shame
to smash these pretty little hands.

178
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,776
Will you please get in the shower?

179
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,403
Come here for a second. Come here.
Come here.

180
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:29,416
You know,
you're in Mexico now, <i>muchacha.</i>

181
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,417
<i>Muchacha?</i>

182
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,683
And you can't just lose a bet like that
and expect to walk away free.

183
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,752
How much do I owe you again?

184
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,829
I'll be quick. So quick.

185
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:48,791
Okay.

186
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:53,003
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

187
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,409
You don't sound fine, honey.

188
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:00,036
Hey, that's really helpful, thanks.

189
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:05,644
Here you go. Come on.

190
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:07,050
Let's get going.

191
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,485
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- What?

192
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,991
You're gonna be back tonight.
I'll just, like, sleep until then.

193
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,660
You wanna spend
our last day sleeping?

194
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:28,704
I'll just hang out, like read or something.

195
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,176
Amy. Come on.

196
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,874
People come from all over the world
just to see these ruins.

197
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:38,214
And this one isn't even on the map.

198
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,184
I'm not taking you
to some tourist trap, honey.

199
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,688
Don't you wanna have some experience
or something to shoot,

200
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,123
other than just the beach, the pool,
the beach, the pool?

201
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,356
Well, you're already dressed.
You might as well just go without me.

202
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:55,126
Hey.

203
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:06,878
But I don't wanna go without you.

204
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:17,254
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah?

205
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:19,258
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

206
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:23,421
Ready?

207
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,624
What are you so happy about?

208
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,402
Watch out for that.

209
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:37,075
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:39,771
Wow.

211
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,679
- Amy, there's a puppy!
- Heinrich?

212
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:47,810
Hello?

213
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:50,819
- What?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,323
So, now what?

215
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,087
We take taxi.

216
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:57,028
- How far?
- 18 kilometers.

217
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:58,462
Hey, how many miles is that?

218
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,967
It's about 11. Maybe a little bit more.

219
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,531
Then there's a path,
which we hike for 4 kilometers.

220
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:08,972
2.5 miles.

221
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,806
Okay, no one said anything
about a hike.

222
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,470
Amy!

223
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,673
- Stacy!
- Come here!

224
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:18,479
Well, I don't see any cabs.
That's a bit of a problem.

225
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:21,813
What?

226
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:25,317
- Yeah.
- I don't know what you're saying.

227
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:28,020
There we go.

228
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,255
Why?

229
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:33,163
No, it's good. Is there a mirror?

230
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:53,182
How much, you drive us here?

231
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,755
No, no. This place, no good.

232
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,518
I'll drive you to pyramid.
<i>Muy grande.</i> Everybody go.

233
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:03,958
I take you. I take you.

234
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,122
Yes.

235
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:06,790
- Hey! Amy, Stace!
- Bye, puppy!

236
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,697
I wanna stay with the puppy.

237
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,694
- Let's go!
- You guys ready?

238
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:11,794
- We got new hats.
- Very nice.

239
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,874
- This is the taxi?
- Yeah, this is it. Come on. Let's go.

240
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,444
My pants are gonna get dirty.

241
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:22,643
Hey, Jeff. Can you give me some water?

242
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:23,951
Take a picture.

243
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:24,042
Take a picture.

244
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,951
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this must be.

245
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,789
How you feeling?

246
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

247
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,428
Oh, my God, I'm so glad that's over.

248
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:16,594
You okay?

249
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:19,673
- My jeans are all dirty.
- Do you have a <i>teléfono?</i>

250
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:21,670
Thanks.

251
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:28,111
Bye, puppy!

252
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:33,918
Wait, how are we gonna get back?

253
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,722
We're gonna call him when we get out.

254
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,417
With what?
We're not gonna get a signal out here.

255
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:43,758
My phone should work.
It's a world phone.

256
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,263
Hello? Can you hear me now?

257
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,423
It's not funny, Eric.

258
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,364
It's like a 20-mile hike
I'm gonna do in flip-flops.

259
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:49,731
Eleven.

260
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,565
It's a little funny.

261
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah, it's working.

262
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,742
- Problem solved.
- Can I have my sunglasses?

263
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,276
Is that your brother's Jeep?

264
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,346
Yeah, it is.

265
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:04,682
It's not funny.

266
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:05,945
It's a little funny.

267
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,111
We go. Coming?

268
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,052
Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's go. Ready?

269
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:10,282
- Yeah.
- Come on.

270
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,255
Want a piggyback ride?

271
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:13,382
- No.
- No?

272
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:22,903
So, there was this girl who got really,
really drunk one night.

273
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:26,462
But she sobered up really,
really quickly.

274
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,938
Who is this?

275
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,305
Just the stupid game
that they were playing last night.

276
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:33,436
But not before she stuck
her tongue down some guy's throat.

277
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:34,741
Eric.

278
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:38,545
How much further is it?

279
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:42,612
We cross a stream,
then there should be a path to the left.

280
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,452
If we seen a village,
then we've gone too far.

281
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:45,820
Wait, there's a village?

282
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,723
Yeah. A Mayan village.

283
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,829
Why did we leave the hotel again?

284
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,771
Whoa!

285
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,602
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

286
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,401
Just almost fell.

287
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,242
- Fucking stinks.
- Whoa.

288
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:08,645
You stink.

289
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,142
- How much further past the stream is it?
- You're funny.

290
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:14,117
Right after, it says.

291
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:19,115
Yeah, well, I don't see any path.

292
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:21,251
Can I have some... Thanks.

293
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,125
My legs are sore.

294
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:31,535
Look!

295
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:34,098
Don't scare them.

296
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,699
I'm not gonna scare them. Hello!

297
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:42,816
They look sad.

298
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:45,610
Hello?

299
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,314
- You guys wanna go talk to them?
- Yeah.

300
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:50,583
Maybe they can guide us.

301
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,224
I don't think they speak Spanish.

302
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:55,522
Look.

303
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,825
Where's he going?

304
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,361
It's here. This must be it.

305
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,904
That's the path?

306
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,408
Why was it covered?

307
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,569
I don't think that's the right path.

308
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:14,112
- It's on the map?
- Yeah.

309
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:15,272
It's on the map.

310
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,883
Jeff, do you see how old
that map looks?

311
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:19,919
And it was covered.
Why would it be covered?

312
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,284
Maybe the archaeologists don't want
people to find their site, guys.

313
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:24,687
Great. They're gonna be thrilled
to see us then.

314
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,350
No, maybe they just found something
valuable, you know,

315
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,449
and they don't want people to rob it,

316
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,462
and just get the Mayans
to keep people away.

317
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,226
- How far away is it?
- It's not far.

318
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:37,768
- Just feels weird.
- Well, what do you wanna do?

319
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:40,738
Just turn around
and walk all the way back?

320
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,950
A hidden path
in the middle of the jungle.

321
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,998
So, do you think
those kids were Mayans?

322
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:15,267
I mean, aren't the Mayans extinct?

323
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,606
Didn't they die
of some fucked up disease?

324
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,770
That's great, Eric.

325
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,814
We could be walking through
an ancient graveyard right now.

326
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:23,644
Like a bone depository or something.

327
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:25,479
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I doubt it.

328
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,177
Did you just mimic me?

329
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:29,983
No, no, I was agreeing with you.

330
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:31,250
He was totally mimicking you.

331
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,019
Was I? Was I really?

332
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,319
Wow.

333
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,487
Oh, wow.

334
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,501
- Finally!
- I think this is it.

335
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,125
See, honey?

336
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:46,161
Wow.

337
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:47,934
- It's beautiful.
- It is.

338
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:50,169
- Can I have my glasses?
- Yeah.

339
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:54,007
- Aren't you glad you came?
- Here.

340
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,283
Look, that's it.

341
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:01,612
Well, we made it.

342
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:04,247
Can I have a drink? Thank you.

343
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,052
Hey, Stace.

344
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:08,354
Mexico!

345
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:09,827
I know I'm a dork.

346
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,227
Mathias?

347
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:14,061
Is that a tent?

348
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:15,225
Where?

349
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:17,234
Up there in the corner.

350
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:19,566
Good job!

351
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:41,923
Heinrich!

352
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:44,360
Maybe he wants some money.

353
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:46,456
What, like a toll or something?

354
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:56,974
Amy. Stop.

355
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:13,752
What the fuck do they want?

356
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:16,056
Show a picture of your brother.

357
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:17,596
On the phone.

358
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,823
Wait.

359
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:30,136
- We're trying to find...
- You seen him?

360
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:52,423
- Ame, don't move!
- Stop!

361
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:53,932
- Amy! Amy!
- Okay.

362
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,262
Don't move. Just don't move.

363
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:57,428
- Give to them! Give to them <i>fotografía!</i>
- Jeff!

364
00:22:57,538 --> 00:22:58,971
- Give to me camera.
- Ame, don't move!

365
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,199
Hey!

366
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,871
- What the hell was that?
- Dimitri.

367
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:07,544
Want the camera?

368
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:09,046
Easy. Easy, just...

369
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,885
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

370
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,549
Stop!

371
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,033
- Amy! Amy!
- Oh, God!

372
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:34,365
Jeff!

373
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:36,902
Heinrich!

374
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:45,942
I need to stop.

375
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:51,416
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Stace. Stace. Look at me.

376
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,219
- I can't breathe.
- Stacy! Look at me!

377
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:54,351
Come on, we gotta go! Come on!

378
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:56,190
There's more coming!

379
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,435
Heinrich!

380
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:20,581
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

381
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,188
Oh, my God, Dimitri!

382
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:26,418
Oh, my God.

383
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:30,195
Why would they do that?

384
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:31,855
I can't breathe.

385
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,934
Eric, get your phone out.

386
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:38,364
There's no signal.

387
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,738
Really? Because if there was a signal
on the road you should be able to...

388
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:45,710
- No, I didn't get one.
- What do you mean?

389
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:47,371
- No, I mean, I never said...
- "Can you hear me now?"

390
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:49,608
- What the fuck was that, Eric?
- What the fuck? It was a joke!

391
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,310
Stop! Stop! Both of you, stop! Please!

392
00:24:54,455 --> 00:24:56,286
Mathias had a signal.

393
00:24:56,423 --> 00:24:57,617
Where's your phone?

394
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,885
The man. He took it.

395
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:09,835
Is it the dig?

396
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:16,335
Heinrich?

397
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,510
Maybe there's another way down.

398
00:25:46,273 --> 00:25:47,706
Heinrich?

399
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:53,008
My God...

400
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,017
Heinrich!

401
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:03,780
Oh, shit.

402
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:06,025
Oh, Jesus.

403
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:28,748
I'm sorry.

404
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:45,260
They keep coming.

405
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,123
They're setting up camps.

406
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:49,733
Why are they doing this?

407
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:51,969
Jesus Christ, they killed them both.

408
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:55,539
I mean what about the girl.
What happened to her?

409
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:57,473
- The one that Heinrich...
- Just stop it, Eric.

410
00:26:57,578 --> 00:26:59,705
I mean, is she okay? Is she even here?
What happened?

411
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:02,805
Just stop it okay. Stop talking.

412
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:06,646
- Give the water, Amy.
- What happened?

413
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:07,954
It's the plant.

414
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:11,719
He's having some sort of
allergic reaction to it.

415
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,816
Why are they doing this?

416
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,485
Maybe they're preparing for something.

417
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:17,188
Like a sacrifice.

418
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,300
It has something to do with the ruins.

419
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,266
They won't come up here.
Now that we're here,

420
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,838
they won't let us leave.

421
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:28,965
So, what do we do,
just wait for someone to find us?

422
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:30,168
Who?

423
00:27:31,678 --> 00:27:32,975
The Greeks.

424
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:38,980
Dimitri left them a copy of the map
before we left.

425
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:44,047
Yeah, and what if they decide
not to come, Jeff?

426
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:47,160
Then somebody else will.

427
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:49,354
We're supposed to check out
of the hotel tomorrow.

428
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:52,397
The hotel's gonna call the police.

429
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:53,556
When?

430
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,961
Tomorrow or the day after.

431
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:01,702
- Our flight is tomorrow, Jeff.
- I know, Amy.

432
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:04,174
But we know what happens if we leave.

433
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,576
Yeah, but what are we gonna eat?
Like, where do we sleep?

434
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:08,681
We should save this.

435
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:10,306
Hey, she's thirsty.

436
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:13,477
I know. We just don't have that much.

437
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:17,353
Well, why do you get to decide, Jeff?

438
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:20,392
Okay. Well, we can all decide.

439
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:23,519
But just keep in mind that each of us
needs a half a gallon of water

440
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,860
every day, just to survive.

441
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:29,094
And right now,
we don't even have a day's worth.

442
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,006
Maybe he's right.

443
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,202
What is that?

444
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,505
Hold on.

445
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,781
A cell phone?

446
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,043
A cell phone?

447
00:28:44,484 --> 00:28:45,746
- Heinrich's.
- Are you sure?

448
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:48,684
Yeah, it's his ringtone.
We had the same phone.

449
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:50,586
How can there be a signal?
There's not a signal up here.

450
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:52,419
It's definitely a phone.

451
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,390
Amy, in the orange tent,
there's a lantern hanging

452
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:57,725
and some matches on the ground.
Can you get them?

453
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:58,889
Eric?

454
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,057
- Eric.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,691
- Come figure this out. Drop that there.
- Okay.

456
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:04,100
Come on. Amy? All right, pull it now.

457
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:05,534
This thing needs to be off, right?

458
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,197
Come on.

459
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:10,940
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

460
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,743
- You got it?
- Yeah, that's it. Let's do this.

461
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,281
- Okay.
- Sure? You ready?

462
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:18,376
Yeah.

463
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:46,038
- Jeff? Jeff?
- Yeah?

464
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:48,846
The rope, I think...

465
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:50,677
- Whoa. Up, up, up!
- Wait, wait, wait!

466
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:53,445
- Pull it up! Up!
- Pull him up! Hurry!

467
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:54,611
- What?
- Hurry!

468
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:56,313
What is it? What?

469
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,989
Oh, shit.

470
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:04,958
Mathias!

471
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:07,499
- Mathias?
- Mathias?

472
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,535
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ.

473
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:13,706
- Oh, Jesus. Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

474
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,000
Is he...

475
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:17,877
No, I can hear him.

476
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:23,842
One of you has to go.

477
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,383
Go? Go where?

478
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:29,254
Down. We're gonna check
the rest of the rope

479
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:30,754
and make sure it's secure.
And then one of you can...

480
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:34,190
Why do we have to go?
Why can't you or Eric?

481
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:36,592
'Cause you're not strong enough.

482
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,664
We need to work the crank.

483
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:46,167
I'll go.

484
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,672
- You will?
- Yeah.

485
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:49,332
Let me check.

486
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:53,242
Thank you.

487
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,189
Just help him into the sling,
and then we're gonna pull him out.

488
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,284
Once we get him out,

489
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:11,056
we're gonna drop the rope
and pull you back up, okay?

490
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:12,631
- Stace?
- Yeah?

491
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:16,198
- You okay?
- Yeah.

492
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:18,533
Hey. You okay?

493
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:19,798
Yep.

494
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,907
Here you go.

495
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:30,107
- Stace, you gotta step off.
- We got you.

496
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,274
Okay.

497
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:36,513
- Okay?
- Okay.

498
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:38,180
You got it?

499
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,192
Stacy?

500
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:22,528
What?

501
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:24,296
It's the end of the rope!

502
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:25,803
I'm not at the bottom!

503
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:27,737
How much further is it?

504
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,937
Can you jump?

505
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,512
Can I what?

506
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:35,080
Can you jump?

507
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:40,449
Please. Help me.

508
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:44,817
Okay.

509
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,429
Stace?

510
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:00,767
You okay?

511
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:09,542
I cut my knee!

512
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:13,152
Can you see Mathias?

513
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:17,118
Yeah, but it's dark!

514
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,624
We're gonna send the matches down.

515
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:22,990
Hurry!

516
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,629
Come on. Think.

517
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:32,329
What can we use?

518
00:33:33,773 --> 00:33:35,468
What about the tents?

519
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:38,840
You know, we could take one down,
cut the nylon into strips.

520
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:02,727
I'm scared.

521
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:05,099
I can't move my legs.

522
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:07,001
You guys?

523
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:11,066
You guys, I think he broke his back!
He can't move his legs!

524
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:12,735
And it smells!

525
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:14,539
Like what?

526
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:15,945
Like shit!

527
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,915
We're gonna have to build a backboard.

528
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:23,784
No way. We can't move him.

529
00:34:23,923 --> 00:34:25,447
Look, we are not
leaving him down there, okay?

530
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,457
How about the backpack frames
and the tent poles?

531
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:29,562
Are you listening to yourself?
Okay, this is insane.

532
00:34:29,663 --> 00:34:31,187
We have to wait for help, okay?

533
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:33,766
Stacy, we have to build a backboard!

534
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:37,460
Okay.

535
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:38,593
Amy, there's tape in the tent.

536
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:41,639
Jeff, we cannot move someone
with a broken back, okay?

537
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,572
- Amy, we have no choice.
- You know that!

538
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,440
You have to go down
and help lift him on!

539
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:46,567
No.

540
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:50,209
- We have to tell them.
- Tell who?

541
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:54,083
We have to tell them.
Maybe they could call someone.

542
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,245
They can send for help.

543
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:56,845
Amy, they're not gonna send for help.

544
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,958
No, we have to try, Jeff.

545
00:35:01,661 --> 00:35:03,629
Amy. Amy! Amy!

546
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:05,688
Amy!

547
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,638
Amy.

548
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:23,806
Amy! Ame.

549
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,983
Help us, please.

550
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:32,048
We need your help.

551
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:34,319
Someone's been hurt.

552
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:36,827
Amy, they can't understand you.

553
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,124
Say it in Spanish.

554
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:39,493
They don't speak Spanish, Ame.

555
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,964
- Just try!
- Ame.

556
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:49,666
Amy, they've already killed Dimitri.

557
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:51,243
I know you're scared.

558
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:52,504
I didn't want to come.

559
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:55,547
- Look at me. Amy. It's gonna be okay.
- I said I...

560
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:58,048
- I shouldn't be here.
- We're gonna get out of this.

561
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:00,482
Okay? Ame?

562
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:01,713
Please.

563
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,751
- They have to help us.
- Ame.

564
00:36:05,558 --> 00:36:07,185
They have to. No, they have to!

565
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:08,726
Ame, Ame! Amy!

566
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,191
I don't want us to get shot, Ame. Please.

567
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:12,866
- Why won't you fucking help us?
- Ame!

568
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:13,764
- Why won't you fucking help us?
- Ame!

569
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:30,777
Ame. Ame.

570
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:57,400
His mother was right there.

571
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:02,877
He touched the vine.

572
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:07,818
We all have.

573
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,155
Stacy?

574
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,888
Can you see it?

575
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,277
Is there anyone there?

576
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:42,011
I can't see it!

577
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:47,285
I wanna come back up!

578
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,268
- Okay.
- Okay.

579
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,807
- You okay?
- Yeah.

580
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:06,970
All right, let's go.

581
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,945
Stace, I'm coming down!

582
00:38:30,937 --> 00:38:32,837
A few more feet!

583
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:35,169
That's all there is!

584
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:38,537
- We have to send it back up.
- No, no.

585
00:38:38,678 --> 00:38:41,340
Amy, I can't stay down here any longer.

586
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,547
We can just lift him.

587
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:47,846
One of us at his shoulders,
the other person at his feet.

588
00:38:47,954 --> 00:38:49,012
What if he twists?

589
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:52,558
It's only a couple of feet, Amy.
We can just lift him.

590
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:55,861
Can you still do it, Ame?

591
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:03,694
Okay!

592
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:06,662
I'm gonna try!

593
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:10,036
Mathias.

594
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:12,373
- Mathias, we're gonna lift you, okay?
- Okay.

595
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,208
We're gonna lift you up and out of here.

596
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:22,953
Okay.

597
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,758
- His hips.
- Are you sure?

598
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:29,885
If you lift him at the feet
he's gonna bend at the waist.

599
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:34,057
Yeah, but I lift him here from his hips,
it's gonna arch his back.

600
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:36,900
His knees.

601
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,932
Okay, quickly. On three, okay?

602
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:46,068
One, two, three!

603
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:47,840
Oh, my! Oh, my God!

604
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:51,447
Just get him on!

605
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:09,967
Pull him up!

606
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,659
Maybe we should carry him into the tent.

607
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:39,993
Squeeze my hand.

608
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:41,657
So he's not cold.

609
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:46,797
I don't think we should move him again.

610
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:50,137
Yeah, but we can't leave him out
in the open like this at night.

611
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:54,009
Let's see if we can find him
some aspirin or something, okay?

612
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:58,047
To keep his blood moving. Guys?

613
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:04,846
Look in the tents. Check the backpacks.
See what you guys can find.

614
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,373
Guys?

615
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,675
Guys?

616
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:35,615
Look. Dimitri's plane ticket.

617
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,086
How does that help us?

618
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:39,953
He was supposed to leave
tomorrow morning.

619
00:41:40,093 --> 00:41:41,583
On a 7:05 flight.

620
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:43,286
So when he doesn't show up tomorrow,

621
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:45,294
his friends are definitely gonna know
that something's wrong.

622
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:47,729
How will they know where we are?

623
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:51,065
They have the map.
Dimitri copied the map for them.

624
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:55,870
So they'll be here tomorrow.

625
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:59,240
We just have to make it through tonight.
That's it.

626
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:04,472
Maybe one of us should keep watch
while the other guys sleep.

627
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:05,743
Sleep?

628
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,927
It's working.

629
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:26,501
How is he?

630
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,439
We gotta keep his legs clean.

631
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,339
That's how it'll happen if it does.

632
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:43,619
If what does?

633
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:45,782
If he dies here.

634
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:47,291
Infection.

635
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:50,429
Jeff, he's not gonna die.

636
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:55,698
- Ame?
- Yeah?

637
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:59,797
I never should've said to lift him up,
should I?

638
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:01,168
I never should have said to lift him.

639
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:03,867
- Don't, Stace. Please.
- It's my fault.

640
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:06,637
Stace?

641
00:43:09,348 --> 00:43:12,215
We're gonna get him
to the hospital tomorrow, okay?

642
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:14,285
He's gonna be okay.

643
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:15,479
Okay?

644
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:19,324
We just gotta rest.

645
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,327
Come on, Stace.

646
00:43:23,496 --> 00:43:26,488
The Greeks will be here tomorrow.

647
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,066
Stace, come on.

648
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,142
Give me your hand.

649
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:36,368
Come closer.

650
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:14,684
- Eric!
- What?

651
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:16,591
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

652
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:17,753
- Eric!
- What?

653
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:21,264
- Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
- Okay, okay.

654
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,699
Oh, my God. It's inside my leg.

655
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:26,567
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

656
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:28,195
- Get it out, get it out, get it out!
- Okay, okay.

657
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:29,604
Okay. Okay.

658
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,175
Oh, my God!

659
00:47:32,078 --> 00:47:34,205
Okay, okay, okay.

660
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:35,712
Get it out.

661
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:40,042
What happened?

662
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,779
Help me.

663
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:43,616
Something's wrong.

664
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:46,884
Please. Something's wrong.

665
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,052
It's okay.

666
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:51,857
- Moving! I can feel it moving!
- Stop! No. I got it out!

667
00:47:51,964 --> 00:47:53,397
- It's moving!
- Stace. What?

668
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:54,523
The vine, it was inside her.

669
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:57,527
- Show me my legs.
- Okay.

670
00:47:57,636 --> 00:47:59,433
- Show me them!
- Okay.

671
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,365
Jeff!

672
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:05,573
- Jeff!
- Help me, please!

673
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:10,807
- Get it off me! Get it off!
- Jeff!

674
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,578
Help me!

675
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:16,814
Help me! Help me!

676
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:18,287
Take them off me!

677
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:21,757
Mathias! You just sit there and breathe.

678
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:23,829
Breathe, Mathias.

679
00:48:23,963 --> 00:48:28,400
I'm gonna make a tourniquet right now.
I'm gonna cut off this bleeding, Mathias.

680
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:30,264
It's on our clothes.

681
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:34,897
It's... It's growing on us.

682
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:46,773
The phone.

683
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:57,085
I don't know how long these'll burn,
so you're gonna have to be quick.

684
00:48:57,196 --> 00:49:00,324
I'd wait to light them
till you're both down there.

685
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:03,629
Link arms. One of you look to the right,
the other, your left.

686
00:49:03,736 --> 00:49:06,534
You'll cover more ground that way.

687
00:49:06,672 --> 00:49:09,971
Search a spot and then move on. Okay?

688
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:42,199
Okay!

689
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,349
Okay.

690
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:09,223
Be careful.

691
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:23,375
Okay.

692
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:28,052
Amy, wait, wait.

693
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:30,451
Come on. We have to find it.

694
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,760
Just stay next to me.

695
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:01,012
Amy?

696
00:51:04,056 --> 00:51:07,287
- That's where it's coming from.
- I can't.

697
00:51:07,393 --> 00:51:10,191
- Come on.
- I don't wanna go in there. Amy.

698
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:12,024
We have to.

699
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:15,662
We have to find it.

700
00:51:22,808 --> 00:51:24,639
It's okay, come on.

701
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,041
Okay.

702
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:37,622
Okay. Ame?

703
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:54,970
Hello?

704
00:52:10,556 --> 00:52:12,023
Oh, my God.

705
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,826
The phone.

706
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:26,871
- It was just ringing.
- Let me see.

707
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:28,906
Yeah. It's cracked.

708
00:52:43,422 --> 00:52:44,616
Amy.

709
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:14,886
Amy! Amy!

710
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:18,956
Oh, my God!

711
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:24,223
Go!

712
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:26,893
Run, Stace! Go!

713
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:38,308
Amy!

714
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:43,915
Amy!

715
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,448
Jump on!

716
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,120
Pull us up! Pull it up!

717
00:53:57,229 --> 00:53:58,321
Pull!

718
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:05,133
Go!

719
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:10,035
Come on!

720
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,809
Come on!

721
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,305
- Are you okay, Ame?
- Get it off!

722
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:18,474
Did you find the phone, Amy?

723
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:19,573
- It's not a phone!
- Amy!

724
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:22,016
No, there is no fucking phone!

725
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,317
What happened?
Stace, what happened?

726
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:34,930
What do you mean,
the flower was making the ring?

727
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:37,433
It was vibrating
and it was ringing like a cell phone.

728
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:39,764
How? Amy, how does it do that?

729
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:43,900
I don't know, Eric. I don't know.

730
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,678
It was moving. It was alive.
It knows we're here.

731
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:48,109
We just have to go.
We have to go. We just...

732
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:49,839
We can't do that, Stace.

733
00:54:49,948 --> 00:54:53,748
Jeff, you didn't see it. Okay?

734
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,346
I'm not staying here.

735
00:54:57,456 --> 00:54:59,947
If we try to leave, they kill us.

736
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:04,458
Mathias can't move.
I can't just leave him here.

737
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:10,025
Okay, maybe we don't all have to go.
I mean, I could go. I can get help.

738
00:55:10,135 --> 00:55:12,865
They have guns, Eric.

739
00:55:12,971 --> 00:55:17,465
There are 50 of them, 60.
They killed that little kid, Amy.

740
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:19,304
Okay, so you guys make a distraction.

741
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:20,468
I can make it to the Jeep.

742
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:22,307
- I can do it.
- It's too dangerous, Eric.

743
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:24,813
- We have to wait.
- Wait for what, huh?

744
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:27,440
For the Greeks.

745
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:29,554
Jeff, the Greeks can't find
their own fucking hotel room.

746
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:30,713
- Eric.
- They're not gonna come out here

747
00:55:30,822 --> 00:55:33,950
- and rescue us.
- We're being quarantined here.

748
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,322
We are being kept here to die!

749
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:38,258
This doesn't happen!

750
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:43,062
Four Americans on a vacation
don't just disappear!

751
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:50,174
Somebody,

752
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:54,143
the police, our parents,

753
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:57,905
the Greeks,

754
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:00,643
somebody,

755
00:56:00,786 --> 00:56:03,118
somebody is going to find us.

756
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:06,190
We just have to be alive when they do.

757
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,592
Where are those keys, Amy?

758
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:19,137
- Amy, where are the keys?
- They're in the backpack.

759
00:56:19,271 --> 00:56:23,230
No. We stay close.
We wait until we're found.

760
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:27,241
We keep someone always on guard.
We keep our wounds covered.

761
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:30,804
And we look out after each other.
That is the only way.

762
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:35,349
Somebody's coming.

763
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,584
Somebody's coming.

764
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:01,842
One swallow apiece.

765
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:04,981
Stace.

766
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:55,992
It's still in there. I can feel it.

767
00:57:56,968 --> 00:57:58,697
See, look how puffy it is.

768
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:01,398
That's just swelling. It's natural.

769
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,100
It's just what happens
when you cut yourself, okay?

770
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:06,733
He won't last much longer like this.

771
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:12,845
- We have to cut them off.
- Cut what off?

772
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:18,948
- His legs.
- Tell me you're joking.

773
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,586
- He'll die if we don't.
- Just please tell me you're joking.

774
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,188
He'll get infected, if he isn't already.
Septicemia.

775
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,734
Well, what the hell is septicemia, Jeff?

776
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:35,864
An infection, usually in the bones,
when it's exposed to bacteria.

777
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:38,633
You're fucking crazy.

778
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:41,075
No, I'm telling you,
he won't last through the day like this.

779
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:42,976
Without anesthesia?

780
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,750
He has no feeling beneath his waist.

781
00:58:46,852 --> 00:58:49,320
The tourniquets are already in place.
We're gonna cut below them.

782
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:50,819
With what?

783
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:55,687
A knife?

784
00:58:58,463 --> 00:59:00,590
We have to break the bones first
and then cut.

785
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:03,361
Well, we're not cutting his legs off
with a fucking hunting knife, Jeff.

786
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:06,198
There's no flesh
covering his bones, Eric.

787
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,169
He is going to die.

788
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:15,611
Okay. Okay, fine. Let's fucking vote.

789
00:59:15,714 --> 00:59:19,514
You know, raise your hands
if you want to cut off his legs.

790
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:29,183
Stacy, what are you doing?

791
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:31,192
He's in med school, Eric.

792
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:33,627
Yeah. Yeah, he's in med school.

793
00:59:33,732 --> 00:59:36,826
He's not a surgeon. He's not a doctor.
He's in school.

794
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:38,800
I'm entitled to my vote, Eric.

795
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:40,462
You do it.

796
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:44,398
Cut them off.

797
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:48,369
Cut them off.

798
00:59:53,084 --> 00:59:54,210
Yeah.

799
00:59:56,955 --> 01:00:01,324
I'll break the bones first, with the stone,
then use the knife to cut through.

800
01:00:01,426 --> 01:00:02,586
Okay.

801
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:06,493
We're heating the pan to cauterize
the wounds to stop the bleeding.

802
01:00:06,598 --> 01:00:08,327
You're not gonna be able to feel a thing,

803
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:13,336
but if you want to bite down on this,

804
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,497
you can, just in case.

805
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:19,004
Eric, you ready?

806
01:00:28,386 --> 01:00:30,547
You should wait in the tent.

807
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,531
Grab his feet.

808
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:52,933
That foot. Turn it up.

809
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:35,611
Hold him down! Eric! Eric!

810
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,017
God!

811
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,429
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

812
01:01:52,237 --> 01:01:53,568
It's okay.

813
01:01:53,872 --> 01:01:55,237
- Eric!
- Jeff!

814
01:01:55,473 --> 01:01:57,407
Hold him fucking still!

815
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:21,726
Jeff!

816
01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:28,304
Jeff, he felt it, didn't he?

817
01:02:28,406 --> 01:02:29,634
Jeff!

818
01:02:31,176 --> 01:02:33,371
- He has nerve damage.
- Yeah.

819
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:36,173
He can't feel anything
beneath his waist.

820
01:02:36,281 --> 01:02:37,475
He was screaming, Jeff.

821
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:39,174
He was screaming.
He was telling you to stop.

822
01:02:39,284 --> 01:02:42,344
He was screaming. How could
he not feel it when he was screaming?

823
01:02:42,454 --> 01:02:43,648
It's just the visual.

824
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:46,849
- It was him looking down and seeing it.
- This is so not okay!

825
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:49,222
We didn't have a choice, Amy.

826
01:02:50,362 --> 01:02:52,330
Amy. It's...

827
01:02:54,366 --> 01:02:56,334
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

828
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,094
Oh, God.

829
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:01,728
What the fuck.

830
01:03:05,443 --> 01:03:07,673
Look, how can it do that?

831
01:03:33,238 --> 01:03:34,865
Check your phone.

832
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:41,211
Let me see.

833
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,014
I just wanna go home.

834
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:24,026
Do you think Stacy's gonna be okay?

835
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:31,436
Yeah.

836
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:35,774
I mean, I got it out. I saw it come out.

837
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:40,605
Yeah, she just really believes...

838
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:43,582
You know how she is.

839
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:47,783
She gets something in her head and...

840
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:55,791
she convinces herself.

841
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:11,977
Do you think that
they're ever gonna find us?

842
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:16,474
Honestly?

843
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:21,815
I think making a run for it
is our only chance.

844
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:29,989
I know.

845
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:40,638
Amy, come here, come here.

846
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:55,815
Eric.

847
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:00,257
What the fuck?

848
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:02,023
What?

849
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:03,927
I heard you.

850
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:06,627
- You heard me what?
- I heard you fucking her.

851
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:07,861
Excuse me?

852
01:07:08,003 --> 01:07:10,801
- Don't lie to me, Eric. I heard you.
- Stace.

853
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:12,965
I heard you. I heard you fucking her!

854
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:14,133
Stacy, come on.

855
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,370
How could you do that to me?

856
01:07:16,512 --> 01:07:19,811
How could you guys fucking sit there
and fuck when I'm in the tent?

857
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:21,883
Stace, you need to calm down.

858
01:07:22,017 --> 01:07:23,951
Don't tell me what I should do.

859
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:25,384
Stacy, you know I wouldn't do that.

860
01:07:25,521 --> 01:07:28,149
- I heard you, Eric.
- We were just talking. I was just...

861
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:31,556
- I heard you moaning, Amy.
- I was crying, Stacy.

862
01:07:31,694 --> 01:07:34,561
- What's going on?
- My boyfriend is fucking your girlfriend!

863
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:37,188
- That's what's going on.
- She's just crazy and irrational.

864
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:40,666
- You think she's never cheated on you?
- Stacy.

865
01:07:42,738 --> 01:07:44,035
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, bitch!

866
01:07:44,173 --> 01:07:46,733
Fuck you! All you ever cared about
is your fucking self!

867
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:49,674
- Stacy, stop it.
- Don't fucking touch me!

868
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:52,406
Relax. You're scared.

869
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:56,143
She would've slept with Mathias
if I hadn't stopped her.

870
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:01,183
Mathias.

871
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,799
Well, thank God we cut his legs off.

872
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:50,235
Shut up.

873
01:08:56,645 --> 01:08:58,306
It's eating me like it's eating him.

874
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:02,213
- Stace.
- No. It's inside. It's inside of me.

875
01:09:02,318 --> 01:09:03,785
Stacy.

876
01:09:03,919 --> 01:09:06,979
It's in my side, Amy. It's in my... It's...

877
01:09:07,122 --> 01:09:11,650
I'll show you. It's here.
If you just cut here and here...

878
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:12,783
- Stacy.
...and here.

879
01:09:12,928 --> 01:09:15,328
- Stacy.
- Stacy, you're okay.

880
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:17,056
- You're okay.
- You're not listening!

881
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,157
- Stacy, you're fine.
- You're not listening!

882
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:21,496
You are not listening!

883
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:23,832
You're not listening to me!

884
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,825
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

885
01:09:45,961 --> 01:09:47,360
What the fuck?

886
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,291
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

887
01:09:52,968 --> 01:09:56,426
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

888
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:59,598
<i>You're not listening to me!</i>

889
01:10:07,683 --> 01:10:11,813
They don't want us to spread it.
That's why they won't let us leave.

890
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,516
They're salting the soil

891
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,532
to keep it contained.

892
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:36,604
It's old. It has to be. Really old.

893
01:10:36,745 --> 01:10:41,773
Because the birds, the insects,

894
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:45,284
somehow they've learned
not to land here.

895
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:50,948
And the horses. Remember?
How frightened the horses were?

896
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:52,788
It didn't happen.

897
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:57,193
What she said about Mathias.

898
01:11:00,336 --> 01:11:03,931
- I didn't...
- You don't have to say anything.

899
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:05,404
But I do.

900
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:08,135
- Because I don't want you to...
- Amy.

901
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,873
Look at us.

902
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,558
Would it matter to you?

903
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:32,094
Guys?

904
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:37,771
Show them.

905
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:57,158
- Okay. Stace.
- I didn't mean to.

906
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,783
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I know.

907
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:03,456
We're gonna start with the one
in your leg. Okay, Stace?

908
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:10,529
It's okay.

909
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:16,135
I'm sorry.

910
01:12:16,245 --> 01:12:20,045
- It's okay.
- You might wanna close your eyes.

911
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:23,982
I wanna see. I wanna see it.

912
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:35,022
Stacey, keep breathing, okay?

913
01:12:35,764 --> 01:12:37,925
Through your nose.

914
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:40,364
Good. Just keep breathing,
keep breathing.

915
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:43,199
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

916
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:46,570
- Okay. Okay. All right, he's almost done.
- I got it.

917
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:50,743
It's okay.

918
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,339
Okay?

919
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:56,111
Should I stop?
Stacy, do you want me to stop?

920
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:57,343
No.

921
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:09,688
- I'm scared. No.
- It's okay. Keep breathing.

922
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,799
Okay, okay.

923
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:16,934
Okay, okay.

924
01:13:24,546 --> 01:13:25,911
It's almost out.

925
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:28,346
No! Oh, no!

926
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:33,888
Oh, my God!

927
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,854
Okay, it's okay.

928
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:39,723
- He got all of it.
- The shirt up.

929
01:13:39,828 --> 01:13:42,092
Hold the other one.

930
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:44,722
It's okay. I'm here.

931
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:50,936
Please.

932
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:18,461
Stace.

933
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,468
There's more of it. There's more.

934
01:14:22,604 --> 01:14:27,769
Right here. Under. Under the muscle,
like by the bone there.

935
01:14:27,876 --> 01:14:29,673
There's nothing there, Stacy.

936
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:33,770
- Yes, can we cut it?
- There's no more cutting.

937
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:36,579
I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.

938
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:37,947
- I wanna cut it. I wanna...
- Hey, don't!

939
01:14:38,053 --> 01:14:41,750
Hey! You can't. You can't keep cutting.

940
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:45,758
- It's just everywhere. It's in my head.
- No.

941
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,125
- It's okay. You're okay.
- No, no.

942
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:52,098
- Yeah, you're okay.
- No, no. I'm not okay. I'm not okay.

943
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:57,160
You keep saying I'm okay. I'm not okay.
Why do you keep saying that to me?

944
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:03,710
Here, this might help.

945
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,792
What? What?

946
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:34,332
Amy, did you see it?
You saw it, didn't you?

947
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:37,469
You saw it in my head. I felt it.

948
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:38,739
Amy.

949
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:42,983
Amy, please tell me.

950
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:45,679
- Stacy.
- Why won't you look at me?

951
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:47,311
Stacy, Stacy...

952
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:49,515
- You saw it?
- It's okay.

953
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:52,753
- You saw it? Did you see it?
- No, I... There's nothing there.

954
01:15:52,894 --> 01:15:55,419
There's nothing there, okay? I swear.

955
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:58,226
It's in my head. I feel it, you guys.

956
01:16:06,475 --> 01:16:08,909
- Let's move her in the tent.
- Okay.

957
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:13,573
No one's coming. I'm going tonight.

958
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:23,484
<i>I wanna cut it.</i>

959
01:17:50,011 --> 01:17:52,411
<i>I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.</i>

960
01:17:55,383 --> 01:17:59,649
<i>I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.</i>
<i>I wanna cut it.</i>

961
01:18:22,043 --> 01:18:24,170
Stacy, what are you doing?

962
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:32,343
Oh, my God!

963
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:40,550
It's okay. It's okay.

964
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:43,597
I just... I just have to get this one out.

965
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,099
It's okay.

966
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:51,606
Just have to get this one.

967
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:55,473
- Stacy?
- No. No.

968
01:18:56,244 --> 01:18:58,872
- Stacy, give it to me.
- No. No.

969
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:01,878
- Give it to me right now.
- No!

970
01:19:03,251 --> 01:19:04,411
Jeff?

971
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:07,145
I'm very sorry.

972
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:09,587
- I have to get this piece right here...
- Stacy.

973
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:12,751
...in my...
- Stacy, give me the knife. Stacy.

974
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:14,921
Stacy, give me the knife, okay?

975
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:16,725
Don't touch me!

976
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:31,136
Easy, stay down.

977
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:33,474
Eric! Eric!

978
01:19:35,016 --> 01:19:36,916
- Eric!
- Oh, my God!

979
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,445
Stay down.

980
01:19:40,555 --> 01:19:42,113
Eric! Eric!

981
01:19:46,127 --> 01:19:48,857
Eric! Amy!

982
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,364
Come here. Come here.

983
01:19:51,499 --> 01:19:54,161
Amy! Eric! Eric!

984
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:59,869
Eric! Amy! Amy!

985
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:07,547
Amy, I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!

986
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,145
It hurts.

987
01:20:10,252 --> 01:20:11,879
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to!

988
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:15,683
- Stacy.
- Eric! Eric! It hurts.

989
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:17,553
Don't move. Don't move.

990
01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:19,023
Eric?

991
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:24,159
Eric? Eric? Eric!

992
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,624
Eric? Eric?

993
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:29,127
No! No.

994
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:31,663
No! No!

995
01:20:31,773 --> 01:20:35,641
- Eric! Eric!
- Come here. Come here.

996
01:20:35,744 --> 01:20:39,646
Eric! Eric! Eric!

997
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:44,843
Stacy.

998
01:20:46,955 --> 01:20:50,413
- Amy. Amy, it hurts.
- No.

999
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,660
- No. No.
- It hurts.

1000
01:20:58,566 --> 01:21:01,399
Kill me. Amy, kill me.

1001
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:03,735
Amy.

1002
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:08,033
Kill me. Kill me!

1003
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:09,735
- Jeff.
- Amy!

1004
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:14,214
- Kill me! Kill me!
- It's okay.

1005
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:16,011
Stace.

1006
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:17,948
You have to, Amy.

1007
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:21,388
Kill me! Amy!

1008
01:21:21,489 --> 01:21:25,050
- Yes! Kill me! Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1009
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,061
- <i>Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!</i>
- Amy.

1010
01:21:40,342 --> 01:21:41,604
Jeff.

1011
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,412
Kill me!

1012
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,911
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

1013
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:10,266
Once you're past the clearing,

1014
01:22:12,974 --> 01:22:16,808
you run as fast as you can, okay?

1015
01:22:20,682 --> 01:22:21,944
Okay?

1016
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:29,682
When you get to the Jeep,

1017
01:22:37,065 --> 01:22:41,001
you don't wait for anything. Anything.

1018
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:47,166
And if these don't work, then you run,

1019
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:51,978
and you don't stop
until you reach the town.

1020
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:59,249
You promise me that you'll still be here?

1021
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,555
Okay.

1022
01:24:07,188 --> 01:24:09,554
You don't even know her name.

1023
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:19,598
You don't know any of our names.

1024
01:24:33,515 --> 01:24:37,281
I'm Jeff. Jeff Dean MacIntyre.

1025
01:24:38,653 --> 01:24:40,484
Winnetka, Illinois.

1026
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:45,689
Twenty-two years old.

1027
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:51,257
I was gonna be a doctor.
That was my dream.

1028
01:24:57,672 --> 01:24:59,469
That's all I wanted.

1029
01:25:11,085 --> 01:25:13,383
You should know her name, too.

1030
01:25:19,994 --> 01:25:21,518
Her name

1031
01:25:22,897 --> 01:25:24,364
is Amy!

1032
01:25:27,035 --> 01:25:30,300
And she is not gonna die
on this fucking hill!

1033
01:25:30,405 --> 01:25:31,531
Jeff!

1034
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:59,658
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1035
01:26:59,794 --> 01:27:01,091
Please.

1036
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:25,716
Okay.

1037
01:27:31,492 --> 01:27:32,754
Okay.

1038
01:28:04,726 --> 01:28:06,717
- Dimitri!
- Dimitri!

1039
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,007
Dimitri!
