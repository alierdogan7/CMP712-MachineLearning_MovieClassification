1
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,237
<i>301A to car 5W, code one.</i>

2
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,318
5W to 301A, go ahead, Johnny.

3
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:35,840
<i>We're chasing the wind, Ben.</i>

4
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>Maybe the guy who sent in that report</i>
<i>drank his breakfast. Let's call it.</i>

5
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:42,086
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

6
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:05,807
<i>It's a kid, all right.</i>
<i>Maybe 50 yards off the road.</i>

7
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:08,597
<i>I'll keep circling her until you pick her up.</i>

8
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:10,479
<i>-10-10.</i>
-10-10.

9
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:36,601
Hey!

10
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:38,926
Hey, honey!

11
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:42,517
Hey, little girl. Little girl!

12
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,566
Wait a minute.
What are you doing out here?

13
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,036
Honey...

14
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,086
...what's your name?

15
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,285
Who do you belong to?

16
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:23,084
<i>Car 5W, code one.</i>

17
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,717
Car 5W to 301A, go ahead.

18
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,086
10-9, Johnny.

19
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:36,803
<i>There's a trailer three miles from you,</i>
<i>off to the side of the road.</i>

20
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:40,197
<i>I didn't see anybody around it,</i>
<i>you better check it out. 10-10.</i>

21
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,039
Okay, Johnny. 10-10.

22
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:46,959
-What's the matter with her?
-I don't know.

23
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,082
Sunstroke?

24
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,199
She's not sunburned.
Couldn't have been out in the sun long.

25
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:52,720
Looks like she's in shock.

26
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:59,963
Johnny spotted a car and trailer up ahead.
Maybe she's from there.

27
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:00,718
Maybe so.

28
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:37,562
No use waking her up unless somebody
can identify her. I'll check it.

29
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:03,603
-What is it?
-Have a look.

30
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,638
This blood must be 10 or 12 hours old.

31
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:41,958
Whatever happened here was either
last night or early this morning.

32
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,881
Check outside.

33
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,597
It was sure no traffic accident, was it?

34
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:32,836
This wasn't caved in. It was caved out.

35
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:34,926
Did you find anything?

36
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,045
No footprints or tire marks.

37
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,796
Found this.

38
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:42,278
I picked up just one. Six or seven more
are scattered over there.

39
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,039
-Sugar.
-Yeah.

40
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,842
There's something over here
you should look at.

41
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,805
I don't know if it's important,
but see what you think.

42
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,082
Mountain lions never come down
to the desert.

43
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:01,996
No cat ever lived
would leave a print like that.

44
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,124
Maybe something was set down there.

45
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,516
A bag, or a can, something like that.

46
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:08,360
It could be almost anything.

47
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,165
I found these inside.

48
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:16,361
Put in a call for fingerprint
and moulage equipment, right away.

49
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,436
Right.

50
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,440
-Have the medics come to pick up the kid.
-Right.

51
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,720
Car 5W to KMA-628. Come in, please.

52
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:33,526
<i>KMA-628 to car 5W, go ahead.</i>

53
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:35,924
We're 12 miles north of the crossroads.

54
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,043
Halfway up the secondary road
to White Butte.

55
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,925
Station wagon and house trailer
with Illinois license plates.

56
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:43,885
They look pretty well beat up.
Looks like a 9-14.

57
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,636
Picked up a little girl
who seems to be in shock.

58
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,685
Send ambulance and medics.
We'll stay here till you arrive.

59
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,120
Anything else?

60
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,203
Ben?

61
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,002
10-10.

62
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:59,603
<i>KMA-628 to 5W,</i>
<i>location previously reported by 301-A...</i>

63
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,881
<i>...will dispatch ambulance.</i>

64
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:08,079
Hi, Reggie, how are the kids?

65
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,886
-Fine, thanks. Another one on the way.
-Good for you.

66
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:23,524
-Do you know what happened to her?
-No.

67
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,325
-Don't know her name?
-No.

68
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,199
Take good care of her.

69
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:31,566
Give her a nice, easy ride.
I'll be with her all the way to the hospital.

70
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:58,806
What was that?

71
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:00,721
I don't know.

72
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:05,242
It must be the wind.
It gets pretty freakish in these parts.

73
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,356
Yeah.

74
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,884
I'll be along soon.
I want to be there when she starts talking.

75
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,800
You know what that is, Cliff?.

76
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:25,400
I haven't the faintest idea.

77
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:29,275
Hurry before the wind fills it in.
Looks like a sandstorm is kicking up.

78
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,282
-You got any idea what happened?
-No.

79
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,524
Nothing that adds up.

80
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,238
How old you figure that kid is?

81
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,880
Five or six.

82
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,365
Tough break for her.

83
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,640
They don't need us right now.

84
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:51,685
Let's go down to Gramps Johnson's store
and see what he knows.

85
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,316
Gramps?

86
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:38,566
Gramps!

87
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,880
Beats me.

88
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:21,838
Look, Ed, put in a call....

89
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,806
Wait a minute.

90
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:57,316
Gramps.

91
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,396
Looks like he was dragged
and thrown down there.

92
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:22,838
-What do you make of it?
-What did you make of the trailer?

93
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:27,080
This wasn't pushed in, it was pulled out.
Just like at the trailer.

94
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,722
Ben, have a look at this.

95
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:31,676
Sugar.

96
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,598
Money wasn't taken here either.

97
00:12:56,087 --> 00:13:00,478
This is another 9-14.
I'll call for the guys at the trailer to come.

98
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,161
I want to be at headquarters
when the girl talks.

99
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:05,078
I'll stick around and ride with them.

100
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,403
-Okay. Stay loose.
-Sure.

101
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:28,442
With all this stuff, we only know
the car and trailer was owned by...

102
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:30,802
...a man named Alan Elinson from Chicago.

103
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:32,360
Yeah, that's all.

104
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:36,759
Stop blaming yourself for what happened
to Ed Blackburn. It wasn't your fault.

105
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,919
Somebody had to stay at Johnson's place,
so it happened to be Ed.

106
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:40,996
Yeah, I know.

107
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:45,603
We'll find out who killed him, if he's dead,
along with Gramps and the Elinson family.

108
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:46,802
So come off it.

109
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:51,520
We'll get a report on the fingerprints
some time this morning. It'll tell us more.

110
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,361
-Have you figured out what this print is?
-No.

111
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:56,916
Great.

112
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:01,237
Kit, run down all Gramps' personal stuff
and records.

113
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:05,283
I don't think he had an enemy in the world,
but somebody might have....

114
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,358
No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

115
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,926
If somebody wanted to knock off Gramps
why tear down half the building to do it?

116
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,286
I put in a call to check out
all the mental institutions.

117
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:18,801
Everything seems to indicate
a homicidal maniac.

118
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:23,764
There's no money stolen,
violent wreckage. Just sugar taken.

119
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:26,721
That's being checked,
but it's a waste of time, too.

120
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,044
We'd have been notified
if there was a loony killer on the loose.

121
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:35,043
Gramps got off four shots from his 30-30
before the killer did this to the gun.

122
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:39,356
And Blackburn was a crack shot.
He could hit anything he could see.

123
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:42,355
Unless your maniac
was armored like a battleship...

124
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:44,085
...there's no maniac in this case.

125
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,361
Yeah, you're right.

126
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,317
I want every available man
scouting the desert.

127
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,922
If our two planes aren't enough
to cover areas the cars can't reach...

128
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:55,238
...I'll ask permission from the chief
to hire a couple more.

129
00:15:56,287 --> 00:16:00,439
Ben, get yourself something to eat
and grab some sleep.

130
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,202
I don't want you wearing yourself out
so you'll fold up on us.

131
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:05,999
-I have a little score to settle.
-We all have.

132
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:09,366
-Report from Washington, Captain.
-All right, thanks.

133
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,521
Fingerprints on the trailer
check out real good.

134
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:17,998
Mr. Elinson was an FBI agent on vacation
with his wife and two children.

135
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:22,083
Call the local FBI office.
They've got a stake in this case, now.

136
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:25,559
Tell them Mr. Elinson's vacation
has been extended indefinitely.

137
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:29,042
It's nice to get off that desert.

138
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:31,925
-It must have been 1 10 out there today.
-At least.

139
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,515
Captain Edwards...

140
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,520
...this is Robert Graham
from the FBI office in Alamogordo.

141
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:40,837
-How do you do?
-Sit down.

142
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,682
Ben here bring you up to date
on this business?

143
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:47,282
Yes, sir, we went over these exhibits
before we left for the desert.

144
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:50,404
I took him to where we found the trailer
and to Johnson's store.

145
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,000
We've been there all day. Nothing.

146
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,919
Any ideas, Mr. Graham?

147
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,765
None that make any sense.

148
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:59,476
I thought you FBI guys were all Quiz Kids,
solved everything right away.

149
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:01,763
I did, too, when I applied for the job.

150
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,917
The planes and cars
haven't found anything.

151
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:07,841
Give them time. People don't just drop off
the face of the Earth without a trace.

152
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,076
We'll find them.

153
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,039
You know what that is?

154
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,167
It beats me. Has it been identified yet?

155
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:19,843
No, an officer took it to a friend
who teaches zoology at the college.

156
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,243
He said he'd never seen anything like it.

157
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:25,365
Lots of evidence, loaded with clues,
but nothing adds up.

158
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:28,360
The Elinson girl is our only real bet.
Any news on her?

159
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,120
No change. I checked with the hospital
a half-hour ago.

160
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,722
I'd like to send this
to our Washington bureau.

161
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,718
They might be able to identify it.

162
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,360
Or prove that it's nothing.

163
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:40,085
It's all right with me.

164
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:41,637
Come in.

165
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,725
-Hello, Fred. Glad to see you, Ben.
-Hi, Doc, how are you?

166
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,206
You two know each other?

167
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:47,875
I don't believe so.

168
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,084
Dr. Putnam, County Medical Officer.
Robert Graham.

169
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,079
-He's with the FBI. Watch your language.
-I will.

170
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:58,517
I finished the autopsy on Gramps Johnson.
You want it technical or plain?

171
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:00,518
Just plain, Doc. Get to the verb.

172
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,039
Old man Johnson could have died
in any one of five ways:

173
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:09,118
His neck and back were broken,
his chest crushed, his skull fractured...

174
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,438
...and here's one for Sherlock Holmes:

175
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:13,722
There was enough formic acid in him
to kill 20 men.

176
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,682
I still don't get this.

177
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:33,636
Doctors Medford, two of them.
Department of Agriculture.

178
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,279
You sent that cast
to your outfit in Washington, didn't you?

179
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,083
Yeah.

180
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:40,676
Does this mean
that somebody has identified it?

181
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,916
I don't know.

182
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,039
-Great.
-Pardon me, sir.

183
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,675
The plane has landed. It'll load over there.

184
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:47,836
Thanks.

185
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,126
-Got a match?
-Yeah.

186
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:28,036
Okay, thank you.

187
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:32,156
Dr. Medford?

188
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,839
Are you Dr. Medford?

189
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:35,724
Yes, yes. No need to shout.

190
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,244
You're the people.
They said you'd meet us.

191
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:40,356
That's right.

192
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,121
I'm Bob Graham.

193
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,675
-How do you do?
-This is Sgt. Ben Peterson.

194
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,405
-You're the one who found the print?
-Yeah, that's right.

195
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,366
Pat, hurry up.

196
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:52,961
I'm caught.

197
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,081
-Can I help?
-No, thank you, I can manage it.

198
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,846
This is the other Dr. Medford,
my daughter, Patricia.

199
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:11,395
This is the man who found the print.
Sergeant....

200
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,364
-Ben Peterson.
-How do you do?

201
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:15,324
Then you must be Mr. Robert Graham.

202
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,045
-Yes, how do you do?
-Hello.

203
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:19,197
We've got a car to take you to the hotel.

204
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:21,005
That can wait. We have work to do.

205
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,806
I want to read all your reports right away.
Come on, Pat.

206
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,036
Excuse me, sir.

207
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,598
I should have had this suit pressed.

208
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,405
She's quite a doctor.

209
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:34,002
If she takes care of sick people,
I think I'll get a fever real quick.

210
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:37,721
This is where the Elinson car
and trailer were found.

211
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,401
Twelve miles down this road
is the Johnson store.

212
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,761
Thank you.

213
00:20:44,847 --> 00:20:48,601
Why did the FBI send that print
to the Department of Agriculture?

214
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,039
They weren't able to identify it.

215
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:55,396
-You only found one print?
-That's right, miss.

216
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,840
Have you identified it?

217
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,602
The Medical Officer's report on Johnson
suggests we were certainly wrong...

218
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:04,043
...to even consider this might be a hoax.
Read that, Doctor.

219
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:06,482
Tell me...

220
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:11,516
...in what area was the atomic bomb
exploded, the first one, back in 1945?

221
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,724
Right here in this same general area.
White Sands.

222
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:21,839
1945. That's nine years ago.

223
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:25,436
Genetically, it's certainly possible.

224
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:30,598
We're grown up. There's no need
to play footsie with us. We resent it.

225
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,724
If you know what this thing is, Doctor,
I suggest you tell us.

226
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,445
We're assigned to this case, too.

227
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,406
Mr. Graham, we cannot tell you
until we're certain of our theory.

228
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:43,960
I'd like to first stop off at the drug store
and then see the Elinson girl.

229
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,515
She's still in shock, Doctor.
She hasn't talked yet.

230
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:50,600
After the girl, I want to examine
the territory where you found the print.

231
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,241
You were saying?

232
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,240
As I explained to Mrs. Johnson,
the little girl's aunt...

233
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:07,436
...we hesitate in using a curare
to diminish the spasms. She's too young.

234
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:11,998
Narcosynthesis would be useless
until we overcome the aphonia.

235
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,085
-What's aphonia?
-Loss of voice.

236
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,327
She's a classic case
of hysteria conversion.

237
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:21,161
Only a severe catharsis
could jolt her at all.

238
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:23,203
May I have a small glass, Doctor?

239
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,639
-Yes, certainly.
-Pat, that acid we got....

240
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:27,923
Acid?

241
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,761
Formic, Doctor. Thank you.

242
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,162
It may provide the jolt you need.

243
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,156
Them!

244
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:57,636
Them!

245
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,116
Them!

246
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,684
May we visit the desert now?

247
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,406
It's getting late.

248
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,519
It's later than you think.

249
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:38,476
Thank you.

250
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:42,761
Quite a breeze.

251
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,282
-The goggles, Doctor.
-What about them?

252
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,597
You're supposed to wear them
over your eyes.

253
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,279
Oh, thank you.

254
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:53,643
Yes, that is better.

255
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:59,156
-So this is where the car and trailer were?
-Yes, sir. Excuse me.

256
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:02,159
-Yes, thank you.
-The print was found right over there.

257
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:06,478
We found it here, by the fire.

258
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,324
You see, there's nothing there now.

259
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:15,077
Has there been any report
of a strange mound?

260
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,205
A cone-shaped structure?
Something recently formed?

261
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:19,956
No, sir.

262
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:24,279
Sergeant, would you mind
if we looked around a little more?

263
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,205
Anything you say, Doctor.

264
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,278
Rather slim pickings for food, Dad.

265
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,006
They'd turn carnivorous
for lack of a habitual diet.

266
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:33,686
I believe you're right.

267
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:36,565
What would turn carnivorous?

268
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:38,803
-My father will tell you.
-When?

269
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,043
-When he's positive.
-Now, look, miss....

270
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:42,681
Doctor....

271
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,959
If the "Doctor" bothers you,
why don't you call me "Pat."

272
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:47,196
I'd like to.

273
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:50,046
I've got a job to do,
and enough mystery on my hands...

274
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:51,799
...without that old....

275
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,963
I mean, your father complicating things.

276
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:59,122
He is one of the world's greatest
myrmecologists.

277
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,796
Myrmecologists!
You see, that's what I mean!

278
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:06,437
Why don't we all talk English?
Then we'd have some understanding.

279
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:07,556
Pat!

280
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:10,280
Come here.

281
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,005
It's the same kind of print.
Look at it, Doctor.

282
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,481
It's gigantic.

283
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,364
Over 12 centimeters.

284
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:23,685
That would make the entire--

285
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,565
About two and a half meters in length.
Over 8 feet.

286
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,446
See if there are more.

287
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:34,158
-This is monstrous.
-So is the murder of five people, Doctor.

288
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:39,239
The direction of that print
would indicate it came from that way.

289
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:45,360
Perhaps we should visit the store.
There may be more there now.

290
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:50,475
Look here, before we do any more visiting,
I want to know exactly what this "it" is.

291
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,876
Gentlemen, I understand your impatience.

292
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:56,516
I know you are concerned with solving
what is essentially a local crime...

293
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,599
...but please believe me,
I am not being coy with you.

294
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:03,965
If I'm wrong, no harm has been done.
But if I'm correct...

295
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,845
...and the mounting evidence
only fortifies my theory...

296
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:10,403
...then something incredible has happened
in this desert.

297
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:14,799
In which case, none of us will dare risk
revealing it, because...

298
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,196
...none of us can risk a nationwide panic.

299
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:18,556
A panic?

300
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,527
Get the antennae! Get the antennae!

301
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,638
Get the other antenna!

302
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,759
Get the other antenna!
He's helpless without them!

303
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,006
What is it?

304
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:33,079
Species appears to be
<i>Camponotus vicinus.</i>

305
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,806
Of the family of <i>Formicidae.</i> An ant.

306
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:40,357
An ant? I don't believe it.
It's not possible!

307
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:43,799
Then this is what got Ed Blackburn,
Gramps Johnson, and the rest?

308
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:46,355
Yes. A fantastic mutation.

309
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:51,039
Probably caused by lingering radiation
from the first atomic bomb.

310
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,362
Notice its odor?

311
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:57,486
Formic acid?
That's why the girl reacted so violently.

312
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,206
The Coroner said
that Gramps was filled with it.

313
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,358
See that? It's the stinger.

314
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:06,237
Ants use their mandibles to rend,
tear and hold their victims...

315
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:10,322
...but they kill with that,
by injecting formic acid.

316
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,678
Mr. Johnson was stung to death.

317
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:15,685
There's no time to lose.
We must find the colony, the nest.

318
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:17,001
There's more of them?

319
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,555
This was probably just a scout,
foraging for food.

320
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,717
You heard the sound. The stridulation.

321
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:23,877
It communicated with others
in the colony.

322
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,958
You mean these things send messages?

323
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:30,359
Of course. All insects have means
of communication with their own kind!

324
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,878
We may be witnesses
to a Biblical prophesy come true.

325
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:53,042
"And there shall be destruction
and darkness come upon creation.

326
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:55,402
"And the Beasts shall reign
over the earth."

327
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:19,400
Doctor, this nest we're looking for.
How many giant ants will be in it?

328
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,479
General, I really don't know.

329
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:25,237
If they follow the usual pattern
of their species, the nest...

330
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:30,163
...depending upon its age,
may contain hundreds or thousands.

331
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:32,957
-Thousands, Doctor?
-It's possible.

332
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:36,802
Look, if we run into thousands
of the thing you killed yesterday...

333
00:30:37,047 --> 00:30:40,881
...it'll take a bomber squadron
plus an infantry regiment to mop up.

334
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,605
How could we keep that a secret?

335
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,882
You're jumping to conclusions, General.

336
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:48,158
There may not be nearly so many
of these creatures as you suppose.

337
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,364
I'm not supposing anything
after looking at that carcass.

338
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:54,439
What I can't understand is
why no one has seen them until now.

339
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:58,156
For one reason, I don't believe
these creatures developed until recently.

340
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:00,557
For another, their being here...

341
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,884
...in these hundreds of thousands
of square miles of desert is....

342
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:10,240
No, that isn't it.

343
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,478
-Could I speak to my daughter, please?
-Of course.

344
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:16,716
Thank you.

345
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:22,196
Hello, Pat?

346
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:26,004
-Pat? You there?
<i>-That's not the way to put in a call, Doctor.</i>

347
00:31:26,287 --> 00:31:28,517
<i>We're Search Able, call Search Baker.</i>

348
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,399
<i>-Right, General?</i>
-Right.

349
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,918
Search Able to Search Baker.

350
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,316
Say, "Over."

351
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:37,801
Then say, "Over."

352
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,002
Over!

353
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:41,965
Medford and Baker to Medford and Able.
Go ahead, Dad. Over.

354
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:43,844
Have you found anything yet?

355
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:44,957
Say, "Over."

356
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:46,878
-I just said it.
-I know. Say it again.

357
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:47,922
Over!

358
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,959
Baker to Able: Not yet.

359
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:53,120
We're about three quarters
of the way across our sector.

360
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,482
We're now at coordinates: Charlie-6.
Over.

361
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,000
<i>Don't pass anything up.</i>

362
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:59,396
Let me know when you find anything.

363
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:01,079
If you're finished say, "Over and out."

364
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,362
-She knows I'm through talking.
-I know she does.

365
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:05,517
It's a rule. You've got to say it.
Right, General?

366
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,563
-Right, Sergeant.
-This is ridiculous.

367
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:10,645
-Lot of good your rules will do--
-Over and out.

368
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:12,479
Now you're happy.

369
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:18,478
Real calm fellow, isn't he?

370
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:24,286
Worried about him?

371
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:29,083
A little. He's not a young man.
He shouldn't have made this trip, but...

372
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:32,603
...he's a scientist and this is
a scientist's dream come true.

373
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:36,597
Hold it!

374
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,596
Fly back over it
and get as close as you can.

375
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,197
You've just found your missing persons.

376
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,086
Look, Dr. Medford...

377
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:36,882
...you're being inconsistent.
First, you insist it's top secret.

378
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:41,480
Nobody else must know or do anything
about getting rid of these big ants.

379
00:33:41,567 --> 00:33:44,127
Correct, General.
Absolute secrecy is imperative.

380
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:47,603
But then you turn around and say
that time is the most important thing.

381
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:51,043
I've been told to take orders from you
and give you what you ask for.

382
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:54,961
But if time is that important, why not let
me go in tonight with some bombers...

383
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,366
...and wipe out that nest?

384
00:33:57,407 --> 00:34:00,717
If you'll just calm down, General,
I'll explain.

385
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:03,243
Doctor, please put up that chart.

386
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,959
Time is important,
more so than you realize.

387
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,722
But bombing that nest tonight
would only aggravate our problem.

388
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:13,760
The reason none of them have been seen
during the day...

389
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,878
...even by the police spotting planes...

390
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,435
...is because they hate
the heat of the desert.

391
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:21,758
They forage between sunset and dawn,
when it's cool.

392
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,725
So half the colony wouldn't even be
inside the nest tonight.

393
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:29,963
Our best chance will be during
the hottest part of the day tomorrow.

394
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:35,316
This illustrates a typical ant nest.

395
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,119
Observe the details.

396
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:39,880
Here is the entrance.

397
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:44,120
These are tunnels, corridors,
and food chambers.

398
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:46,721
Note the wonderful
and intricate engineering.

399
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:50,159
Water traps,
so that none will drown during rains.

400
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:53,241
This is somewhat oversimplified, I admit...

401
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,319
...but it will give you an idea
of what we are up against.

402
00:34:57,087 --> 00:35:00,477
Do you know that some species
of desert ants dig down...

403
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,763
...as deep as 30 feet or more?

404
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:05,600
That nest we found today
might go down hundreds of feet.

405
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,201
We can pinpoint that opening.
Seal it up for good.

406
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,721
The creatures would only tunnel out
somewhere else.

407
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:14,079
We don't want that nest damaged.
Not yet.

408
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:15,322
What do we do?

409
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,205
First, we wait until noon tomorrow.

410
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:21,324
By that time,
all of them should be within the nest.

411
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,481
To keep them confined in there
is our next problem.

412
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,680
We have two possibilities:

413
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,076
First would be to flood the nest.

414
00:35:29,247 --> 00:35:33,479
Ants will not come through deep water.
They breathe through their sides.

415
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:37,606
Excuse me, Doctor, there's no water line
within 20 miles of that place.

416
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,679
That's why you asked me to check
our meteorological station.

417
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:42,883
Any chance of getting cloud formations?

418
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,197
Nothing that would make
cloud seeding pay off.

419
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:48,324
Nobody's had any luck
in making rain in this part of the desert.

420
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:49,760
The second possibility?

421
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,476
Enough heat to drive the ants deeper
down into the nest, and hold them down.

422
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,205
But no bombing?

423
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:58,763
What about phosphorus? We can lay it
over that mound with bazookas.

424
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,877
That would keep the surface area hot.

425
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:04,285
What happens after that?

426
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:07,518
We then drop cyanide gas
into the opening and kill them.

427
00:36:08,007 --> 00:36:10,202
How can you be sure
you'll get all of them?

428
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:11,925
We go down into the nest and find out.

429
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:39,560
Don't forget to tap me
when you get that wired, General.

430
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,320
Don't rush me. I'm doing this by the book.

431
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:48,325
It's the first time
I ever loaded one of these babies.

432
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:52,440
That makes us even. This is the first time
I've ever given orders to a general.

433
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:40,766
We should've waited for it to cool more.

434
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,441
We don't dare lose time
getting cyanide into that nest.

435
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:28,720
Marvelously made.

436
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,959
Marvelous. Tell me,
you only saw the one live ant?

437
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:34,801
He seemed to be trying to get out,
rather than get us.

438
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:38,277
He stopped moving when the gas hit him.
Then he dropped out of sight.

439
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,403
Didn't see or hear a thing from then on.

440
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:42,159
You think they're all dead down there?

441
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,044
I think so. You used enough gas.

442
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:47,278
All parts of the nest should have been
thoroughly saturated by now.

443
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,086
If I can still raise an arm
when we get out of here...

444
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,317
...I'll show you
how well saturated I can get.

445
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:53,362
I'm with you.

446
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:55,119
If I were a younger man, I....

447
00:38:57,767 --> 00:38:59,246
What are you made up for?

448
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:01,158
I'm going with you and Ben.

449
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:03,756
No, you're not.

450
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:05,997
Someone with scientific knowledge
has to go.

451
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:09,400
My father is physically unable to do it.
That leaves me.

452
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,923
That leaves you here. We don't know
what we'll find down there.

453
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:16,159
One thing for sure,
it's no place for you or any other woman.

454
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:20,081
She wanted to go, Robert.
As a scientist, I couldn't forbid her.

455
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,522
-A trained observer has to go.
-What for?

456
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:25,246
There are more important things
than finding dead ants.

457
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,966
-You wouldn't know what to look for!
-You tell us what.

458
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,641
There's no time to give you a course
in insect pathology!

459
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:33,002
So let's stop talking and get on with it.

460
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,156
Okay.

461
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:41,960
Don't worry, Dad.

462
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:51,715
Good luck, Sergeant.

463
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:53,241
You come last, Pat.

464
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:56,401
Throw us the rest of the stuff down
when I signal.

465
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,316
Hold it.

466
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:52,038
They're dead or they would have attacked
us right away.

467
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:08,355
Look. Held together with saliva.

468
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:12,439
Spit is all that's holding me together
right now, too.

469
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,678
How come the gas didn't knock them off?.

470
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:29,201
The chamber looked caved in,
maybe from the bombing.

471
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:32,201
Sealed up that way,
the gas couldn't reach them.

472
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:36,280
If we run into any more live ones,
we're getting out of here.

473
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:05,155
This is it!

474
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:08,036
The queen's chamber, and the eggs.

475
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:41,000
-This is what I was afraid of.
-What's the matter, Pat?

476
00:43:41,447 --> 00:43:42,516
They're empty.

477
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:46,964
-What came out is dead, right?
-Not the ones that hatched from these!

478
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,563
Now destroy everything in here. Burn it!

479
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:55,115
-What?
-I said burn it. Burn everything!

480
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:23,040
Very strange.

481
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:25,400
Most unusual.

482
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:28,042
There were no larvae or pupae
in the egg chamber.

483
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:30,482
They all seemed to hatch
directly from the eggs.

484
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,683
I attribute it to the mutation process.

485
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,644
That's the logical conclusion.

486
00:44:34,727 --> 00:44:38,686
You feel sure those two have gone?
You found no winged ants?

487
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,520
We saw only worker ants.

488
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:43,121
I don't get it.
You act like it was the end of the world.

489
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:44,401
It could be.

490
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:48,764
These two empty egg cases
contained queen ants.

491
00:44:49,247 --> 00:44:53,525
Newborn queen ants have wings,
so have their consorts, male ants.

492
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:57,042
-You found no ants with wings?
-Not a one.

493
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:00,678
The fact is we didn't destroy
this first nest soon enough!

494
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:06,038
Two young queen ants hatched out,
dried their wings and flew away...

495
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:10,155
...each with one or more winged males.
They've gone on their wedding flight.

496
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:14,601
We needn't worry about the males.
They'll die very quickly, but the queens--

497
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:17,679
Doctor, are you telling us
there'll be other nests?

498
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:20,804
A single queen can lay thousands of eggs.

499
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:25,360
From these will hatch dozens
of other queens, who may in turn....

500
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:28,560
How far can they fly?

501
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,962
These giants? I don't know.

502
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:37,160
Ordinary queens of the smaller species
have very limited flying powers.

503
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:41,800
They're dependent mostly on winds
and thermal currents to carry them along.

504
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:45,840
They have been found in the stratosphere.
But these giants....

505
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,565
I don't know, you guess.

506
00:45:48,647 --> 00:45:50,478
I thought today was the end of them.

507
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:51,556
No.

508
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:53,764
We haven't seen the end of them.

509
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,756
We've only had a view of the beginning
of what may be the end of us.

510
00:45:59,687 --> 00:46:01,917
We'd better inform Washington, General.

511
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:19,915
Sergeant Peterson.

512
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,998
-Sir?
-What about your superiors?

513
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:25,557
Do they know these creatures
are causing the crimes in your desert?

514
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:26,796
No, sir, they don't.

515
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:29,879
Gen. O'Brien and Dr. Medford
felt that absolute secrecy...

516
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:32,561
...about the existence of the big ants
was essential.

517
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:35,559
Do you also think this extraordinary
hush-hush is necessary?

518
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:39,640
Yes. I don't think there's a police force
anywhere that could handle the panic...

519
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:42,002
...if people found out
these babies were loose.

520
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:44,237
Gentlemen, I believe we are ready.

521
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:49,762
Some of you have displayed incredulous
attitudes towards our reports and photos.

522
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,477
The rest of you are trying to understand
the gravity of our situation...

523
00:46:54,247 --> 00:46:57,444
...but repeatedly ask
how really serious it is.

524
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:02,122
For your edification,
I have prepared a short film...

525
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:06,805
...which I hope will give you some idea
of the nature of the creatures we face.

526
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:08,758
In a small way, of course.

527
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:11,324
Robert, please turn out the lights.

528
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:22,279
These ants and related species
are common to most of America.

529
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:27,441
In fact, you can find them in backyards,
empty lots, and fields...

530
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:29,802
...throughout the temperate zones
of the world.

531
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:32,845
They haven't changed in form or habits...

532
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:35,237
...for more than 50 million years.

533
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,360
Here, for instance, is one such specimen...

534
00:47:38,447 --> 00:47:42,156
...that got himself trapped in amber,
which we know is at least that old.

535
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:45,526
Now we come
to some different kind of ants.

536
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:50,245
The big fellow there,
feeding on the smaller, red grease-eaters...

537
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:54,965
...is of a savage species called
<i>Camponotus vicinus Mayr.</i>

538
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,919
He's of a desert variety.

539
00:47:57,367 --> 00:48:01,326
Very similar to the giant mutations
we found in New Mexico.

540
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,715
There is a side view of a small nest.

541
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:07,158
Those white objects are ant eggs.

542
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:10,927
Ants don't see well at all.

543
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:16,357
They hear, smell and locate objects
with their radar-like antennae.

544
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:20,362
Only after food or an enemy is located
with the antennae...

545
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:23,162
...are the savage mandibles put to work.

546
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:28,199
Now, gentlemen,
watch this demonstration of power.

547
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,086
A pebble has blocked
the entrance to the nest.

548
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:34,161
That creature is determined
to remove the obstacle.

549
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:39,637
Note how the mandibles are used
to grasp the pebble and pull it aside...

550
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:42,036
...with only a slight assist
from another ant.

551
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:45,998
There's the same pebble
on a laboratory scale.

552
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:49,803
Balancing it, is a dish containing 20 ants.

553
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:54,446
We've learned that one of these
quarter-inch long insects can lift...

554
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:56,717
...20 times its own weight.

555
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:00,039
That's equal to one of you
lifting a ton and a half or more!

556
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,317
Here are rare shots of a newborn queen
and her consorts.

557
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:11,002
Technically, she should be referred to
as a princess, until after the mating flight.

558
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:14,279
Now there is a close shot
of a winged male.

559
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:18,806
Males are unequipped for survival
beyond the mating and die soon after.

560
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:23,758
The queen flies on, or more precisely,
is borne by the winds...

561
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:27,596
...until her need prompts her
to seek a place to lay eggs.

562
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:31,723
Does a queen ever fly away
from her nest once she's established it?

563
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:35,243
No, never. She loses her wings
after the wedding flight.

564
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,445
See? One has dropped off.

565
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:43,204
Now she starts her function
of establishing a place...

566
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,445
...in which to lay her eggs
and begin the nest.

567
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:50,276
Queens live quite a long time.
They continue to lay eggs...

568
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:52,119
...from the one mating...

569
00:49:52,207 --> 00:49:54,926
...for from 15 to 17 years.

570
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,445
Here are ants at war.

571
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:03,761
As you can see, ants are savage,
ruthless and courageous fighters.

572
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:09,442
This fight lasted 72 hours
between those two alone.

573
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:14,879
Ants are the only creatures on Earth
other than man...

574
00:50:15,087 --> 00:50:16,281
...who make war.

575
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:19,440
They campaign.
They are chronic aggressors.

576
00:50:19,607 --> 00:50:22,519
They make slave laborers
of the captives they don't kill.

577
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:28,118
None of the ants previously seen by man
were more than an inch in length.

578
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:30,598
Most were considerably under that size.

579
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:35,841
But even the most minute of them
have an instinct and talent for industry...

580
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:39,278
...social organization and savagery...

581
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:44,042
...that makes man look feeble
by comparison.

582
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:46,324
How large were the ants you found?

583
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:49,684
The smallest measured nine feet
in body length.

584
00:50:50,087 --> 00:50:52,157
That, gentlemen, is why you are here.

585
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,200
To consider this problem.

586
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:57,279
And l hope, solve it.
Because unless you solve it...

587
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:00,081
...unless these queens are located
and destroyed...

588
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:03,404
...before they've established
thriving colonies and can produce...

589
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:06,047
...heaven alone knows
how many more queen ants...

590
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:10,200
...man, as the dominant species
of life on Earth...

591
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:12,085
...will probably be extinct...

592
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:16,443
...within a year, Doc?

593
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:30,363
-How about some information, Senator?
-Sorry, boys, no comment.

594
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:32,563
There must be something you can tell us.

595
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:37,596
All the newswire services, AP, UP, INS,
are in there, but nothing's coming out.

596
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,202
No newsmen are being allowed in there.

597
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,926
What was that mysterious
3:00 a.m. meeting about?

598
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,998
Can't tell you a thing, boys, sorry.

599
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:52,321
There are about a million radio receivers
installed in there, too.

600
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,159
-What for?
-I don't know.

601
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:24,401
Texans. When bigger stories are told,
Texans will tell them.

602
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:27,638
Should fit in with the kind of stuff
they're looking for upstairs.

603
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,922
-Know what's going on in this building?
-No.

604
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:32,646
Real "T.S." stuff. Top Secret.

605
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:43,001
Okay, we'll meet you at the airport
in 20 minutes.

606
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,319
Says he can have us in Brownsville
in less than three hours.

607
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:50,400
Good luck, Bob.

608
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:04,997
They ain't kidding me. Nobody is.
Not you, not anybody.

609
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:07,806
This isn't a hospital.
This is a loony bin. A nuthouse.

610
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:11,644
Do you think I'm crazy?
I don't care what you think. I'm not!

611
00:53:11,727 --> 00:53:14,287
I saw those things with my own two eyes!

612
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:18,246
Do you think anybody could make it up?
A guy would have to be nuts....

613
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:25,199
You're a flyer. You didn't get that yard
sitting on the ground.

614
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:27,084
You've seen guys blow their stacks.

615
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:30,757
Do you think I act and talk
like a guy who has lost his marbles?

616
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:32,923
Tell us what you saw, Mr. Crotty.

617
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:36,522
I've told those head-shrinking doctors
four dozen times! I'm sick of it.

618
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:40,522
I tell them and I get laughed at
and clucked over.

619
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,485
You promise not to laugh at me?

620
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:46,603
Promise.

621
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:48,516
Okay.

622
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:52,876
I was flying south from Corpus Christi,
heading here, Brownsville.

623
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:57,880
I turned in from the Gulf, heading for
the airport about 20 miles out...

624
00:53:58,087 --> 00:54:01,716
...all of a sudden I see these flying saucers.

625
00:54:01,807 --> 00:54:04,116
Three of them.
One big and two little ones.

626
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:07,479
I had to do some fancy flying
or they'd have run right into me.

627
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:11,845
I dived down and landed
in the first place I saw, a street.

628
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:14,203
I've never been so rattled in my life.

629
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:16,719
I cracked up a little, sure.

630
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:19,964
I plowed into an old Ford
and ended up on someone's porch.

631
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,719
Who wouldn't lose their head
after seeing something like that?

632
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:26,924
-They were flying saucers?
-I don't know what else to call them.

633
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,204
They were shaped...

634
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:32,000
...like ants.

635
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:38,806
It sounds crazy
but that's what they were shaped like.

636
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:43,239
The big one was about 15 feet long
and had wings like a fly.

637
00:54:43,607 --> 00:54:47,646
The other two seemed to be chasing
the big one. One here. Two here.

638
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:52,079
They zoomed around me like kamikazes.
Scared me out of my pants!

639
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:54,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

640
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:58,237
They said that Ford wasn't a new one.
It was all beat up to begin with.

641
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:00,284
So what's all the beef?.

642
00:55:03,127 --> 00:55:05,163
You don't believe me either. Do you?

643
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:06,566
On the contrary, we do.

644
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:07,636
You do?

645
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:09,203
Good.

646
00:55:09,447 --> 00:55:13,804
What direction were these flying saucers
going the last time you saw them?

647
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:17,523
West, I'd say. Yes, due west.

648
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:19,924
Will you get me out of here?

649
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:23,005
-We'll speak to the doctor about it.
-I'd appreciate it.

650
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,682
Try and get my clothes, too.
They only gave me these slippers...

651
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:29,721
...but not even a rope to hold up my pants.

652
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:32,964
-We'll be seeing you.
-Be right neighborly if you could help.

653
00:55:33,047 --> 00:55:34,446
I'll sure be hoping.

654
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:37,043
-Mr. Graham?
-Yes?

655
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:39,516
How was your talk with Mr. Crotty?

656
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:41,923
You're wise to keep him locked up, Doctor.

657
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,676
I've recommended his release.
He's not demented.

658
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:49,602
I'm convinced he's trying to pull
a publicity stunt with this weird story.

659
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:51,564
The government wants him
to be kept here...

660
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:53,205
...so he doesn't get any publicity.

661
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:54,402
The government?

662
00:55:54,527 --> 00:55:56,324
He's to have no visitors.

663
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:59,956
If any information is given out about him,
you'll be held responsible.

664
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:02,557
I can't tell you why this is essential.

665
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:05,964
We'll let you know as soon as possible.
We'll tell you when he's well.

666
00:56:11,727 --> 00:56:15,959
A bit more than 700 air miles
from White Sands to Brownsville.

667
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:17,556
Southeast.

668
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:20,766
This Crotty said they were heading west
when he saw them.

669
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:21,802
I believe him.

670
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:26,563
There were strong easterly winds
the day Crotty saw the ants.

671
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:29,202
They'd follow the line of least resistance.

672
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:33,565
We can surmise that one of the queens,
possibly both of them...

673
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:37,164
...can create nests in this general area.

674
00:56:38,247 --> 00:56:40,442
We'd better inform
the Mexican authorities...

675
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:43,280
...and concentrate our search efforts here.

676
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:47,197
As far south as Panama. As far north as...

677
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,039
...Santa Barbara, on the California coast.

678
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:53,278
That's an awful lot of area, Doctor.

679
00:56:53,967 --> 00:56:54,956
I'll get it.

680
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:57,836
Hello?

681
00:56:58,407 --> 00:57:00,204
Dr. Medford speaking.

682
00:57:01,807 --> 00:57:02,876
What?

683
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:05,040
I'll be right there.

684
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:17,917
"A nest hatched aboard a ship at sea."

685
00:57:37,807 --> 00:57:41,356
I'm sure you gentlemen will be interested
in this report I just received:

686
00:57:41,447 --> 00:57:45,281
"<i>U.S.S. Milwaukee</i> got radio bearing on
<i>S.S. Viking</i> before signal stopped.

687
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:48,595
"<i>Milwaukee</i> proceeded at once to location.

688
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:51,605
"Two seamen from <i>Viking</i>
rescued from sea by <i>Milwaukee.</i>

689
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:54,636
"Seamen said no survivors remained
aboard <i>Viking.</i>

690
00:57:55,327 --> 00:57:57,887
"Not possible to put aboard
search and rescue party...

691
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:00,435
"...as <i>Viking</i> was infested
with the giant ants."

692
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:05,442
Upon my orders, the <i>S.S. Viking</i>
has been sunk with naval gunfire.

693
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:08,122
This was accomplished
at 0700 this morning.

694
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:10,761
I don't see how a ship at sea could....

695
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:12,602
Dr. Medford...

696
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:16,198
...how could these giant creatures
get aboard that vessel unseen?

697
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:20,920
The <i>S.S. Viking</i> anchored in Acapulco,
Mexico, for three days and four nights.

698
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:26,245
It's then and there we believe one
of these missing queen ants flew aboard.

699
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:28,804
Please give them your information.

700
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:33,720
"Owners of the <i>S.S. Viking</i> reported
that on hold number one...

701
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:37,635
"...the hatch cover was off during
the entire time of loading. Even at night.

702
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:41,920
"The crew had shore leave every night so
only a skeleton crew remained on watch."

703
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:46,436
It was quite possible for a queen ant
to have flown onto that ship unseen.

704
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:50,521
An open hold would be inviting as a place
to lay her eggs and hatch out a nest.

705
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,523
I think it's time to inform the public.
It can't be kept a secret indefinitely.

706
00:58:55,607 --> 00:58:56,926
We can't risk it, sir.

707
00:58:57,007 --> 00:58:58,406
But you already have.

708
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:02,157
The entire crew of the cruiser <i>Milwaukee</i>
knows about these things now.

709
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,081
They know, but the <i>Milwaukee</i>
will be kept at sea until this is resolved.

710
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:10,241
What do those flags on the map indicate?

711
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:14,596
These four indicate where we found
dead male ants.

712
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:19,879
The most recent finding was about four
days ago near Mt. Wilson in California.

713
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:24,686
It was decomposed and must have been
there for a month to five weeks.

714
00:59:25,487 --> 00:59:28,877
This flag, at Los Angeles, indicates a lead.

715
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:31,806
Mr. Graham and Sgt. Ben Peterson
are there now.

716
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:35,602
They were flown there by Maj. Kibbee
to check on a large sugar theft.

717
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:36,955
Forty tons, to be exact.

718
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:56,405
When was this car broken into?

719
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:58,079
I told you, Friday night.

720
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:01,559
Yard watchman claims
he didn't see or hear a thing.

721
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:04,077
What's so important
you got to work on Sunday?

722
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,361
Where's the watchman?

723
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:09,565
City jail. Any boob knows you need trucks
to carry away 40 tons of stuff.

724
01:00:09,727 --> 01:00:12,480
Said he didn't hear them.
He's either lying or he's deaf.

725
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,716
And he ain't deaf.

726
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:16,359
-Let's go see him.
-Yeah.

727
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,166
Thanks, buddy.

728
01:00:19,247 --> 01:00:21,886
After spoiling my day off
you could at least tell me...

729
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:24,527
...how come a government cop
is so interested in this deal.

730
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:26,245
He's got a sweet tooth.

731
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:32,677
-This the only job you've ever had?
-Yes, sir.

732
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:35,839
I've had a clean record
for 30 years at the railroad.

733
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,437
Yard cop thinks you made a deal
not to see that car broken into.

734
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:40,960
What sense does that make?

735
01:00:41,047 --> 01:00:43,607
Is sugar rare cargo?
Is there a black market for it?

736
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:46,201
Did you ever hear of a fence for hot sugar?

737
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:50,003
If I made a deal with crooks,
it wouldn't be for 40 tons of sugar!

738
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,840
I swear I didn't hear a thing Friday night.

739
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:54,486
I'll be right back.

740
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:02,406
That woman just identified the body
of her husband. See him right away.

741
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:05,917
I've never had anything to do with crooks.
I'm an honest man.

742
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:08,965
Sure, you can go home now.
Take care of him, will you?

743
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,003
Thank you.

744
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:13,357
I don't think this happened in a machine.

745
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:17,082
Any machine that pulled hard enough
to tear his arm off at the shoulder...

746
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:19,158
...would also have chopped up his face.

747
01:01:19,447 --> 01:01:21,642
Look at the laceration across his chest.

748
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:25,165
Can't figure it, except he died from shock
and loss of blood.

749
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:26,600
Thanks very much.

750
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:32,046
His name's Thomas Lodge.

751
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:35,802
Police found him, 6:30 a.m.
His car jumped a curb, went into a sign...

752
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:39,482
...but not hard enough to do that.
They couldn't find the other arm.

753
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,039
His wife said
that he left the house at 5:45.

754
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:46,597
He had his two kids with him.
No sign of the kids yet.

755
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:52,396
Mrs. Lodge...

756
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:55,684
...was your husband accustomed
to taking his boys out so early?

757
01:01:56,207 --> 01:02:00,837
Tom works on Sunday from 9:00 to 7:00.
It's an extra job he had.

758
01:02:01,527 --> 01:02:04,963
He works so hard, he doesn't have
much time to spend with Jerry and Mike.

759
01:02:05,047 --> 01:02:08,960
Sundays they get up early
and go somewhere together to play.

760
01:02:10,407 --> 01:02:13,001
Do you know where they might
have gone this morning?

761
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,156
Where?

762
01:02:15,087 --> 01:02:17,078
They go different places.

763
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:20,237
Last Sunday,
Tom took the boys to the zoo.

764
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:22,645
They had such a good time.

765
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:25,521
Tom fixed it with a keeper
so they could get in early...

766
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:27,598
...and watch the feeding of the animals.

767
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:29,439
Jerry talked about it all week.

768
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:32,080
Where else did they go?

769
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:37,876
Sometimes Tom took them boat riding
at MacArthur Park.

770
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,925
For pony rides and miniature golf.

771
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:44,839
They always come home so happy.
And so dirty!

772
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:49,286
I kept asking Tom to do things
where they won't get so dirty.

773
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:51,517
I spent the rest of the day cleaning them.

774
01:03:10,647 --> 01:03:12,365
Can I see you a moment?

775
01:03:18,687 --> 01:03:20,166
-Rough?
-Yeah.

776
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:23,963
Bob, these are the two officers
who found Lodge.

777
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:25,566
-This is Ryan.
-Sutton.

778
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:28,804
Patrolmen Sutton and Ryan.
This is Bob Graham.

779
01:03:29,407 --> 01:03:33,036
Dr. Medford and Pat are flying here
with Gen. O'Brien tonight.

780
01:03:33,327 --> 01:03:36,364
Kibbee called. He'll be over
after he's had a little breakfast.

781
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,439
Show me on the map
just exactly where you found Lodge.

782
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:43,759
-Right there.
-And he was dead when you found him?

783
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:45,839
Where's MacArthur Park?

784
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,846
That's a long ways.

785
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:53,116
We've got to find out
where he took those kids.

786
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:55,437
He couldn't have driven far.
He was too cut up.

787
01:03:56,727 --> 01:04:00,197
Is there any area where you found him
where he might've taken the kids...

788
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,677
...for a boat ride or miniature golf?.
Pony rides, stuff like that.

789
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:05,957
I don't know of any miniature golf courses.

790
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:08,561
Griffith Park is the closest
where they rent horses.

791
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:12,799
That's a long way, too.
Doesn't his wife know where they went?

792
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:14,482
No.

793
01:04:15,047 --> 01:04:18,926
Did you make any arrests this morning,
say between 4:00 a.m. and noon?

794
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:20,076
Yes, sir.

795
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:23,356
Four. Three drunks and a traffic citation.

796
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,525
I'd like to talk to all of them.

797
01:04:26,647 --> 01:04:29,445
They might have seen something
that'll help us.

798
01:04:33,727 --> 01:04:35,604
Where were you going
when you were arrested?

799
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:36,642
I don't know.

800
01:04:36,727 --> 01:04:38,957
I don't even know
where I was coming from.

801
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:42,161
-How about you?
-I don't know either.

802
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,841
As I said before,
I prefer the informal type of social life.

803
01:04:50,207 --> 01:04:53,005
-I disagree with you.
-Really?

804
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:55,243
I'm at my best in my white tie and tails.

805
01:04:55,327 --> 01:04:57,921
All right, Beau Brummell, knock it off.

806
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:59,076
Look, miss....

807
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:02,045
-All I did was go through a red light.
-At 60 mph?

808
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,119
-Was something chasing you?
-No, I was in a hurry to get home.

809
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:06,196
Where from?

810
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:09,160
I spent the night with a sick friend.

811
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:12,520
I'd rather not mention any names,
he's married.

812
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:15,239
-Okay, you can go.
-Thank you.

813
01:05:17,607 --> 01:05:20,963
I'm through with them. Let them
go back to the tank and sleep it off.

814
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:23,561
-All right, let's go.
-With pleasure, sir.

815
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:27,519
You said there were three drunks?

816
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:30,201
The other one's in the alcoholic ward
at the hospital.

817
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:32,482
Practically a permanent resident there.

818
01:05:32,647 --> 01:05:34,126
Let's go talk to him, too.

819
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:39,520
Sneaked out of here Saturday afternoon.
Back at 5:00 this morning.

820
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,963
You can talk to him,
but I don't think he'll cooperate.

821
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:45,038
Hey, Admiral, are we gonna be drafted?

822
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:46,276
No, sir.

823
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:50,121
Behave yourself, Harry.
This is the man. Mind your manners.

824
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:53,524
-If he gives you trouble, I'm right outside.
-He won't.

825
01:05:53,607 --> 01:05:55,518
Hello, Jensen. How are you?

826
01:05:55,687 --> 01:05:59,282
How do, gentlemen? Looking for recruits?

827
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:00,561
Not today.

828
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:03,565
-Jensen, you come here often, don't you?
-I like it here.

829
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,525
-What have you been doing lately?
-Same as always, nothing.

830
01:06:06,607 --> 01:06:09,599
-But I got some deals on.
-Sure.

831
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:13,043
You didn't see anything unusual
yesterday or this morning, did you?

832
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:16,199
No, nothing unusual. Same as always.

833
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:18,600
They're gone now.

834
01:06:19,407 --> 01:06:21,796
I saw some little airplanes this morning.

835
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,917
Didn't seem big enough
for them to get into.

836
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,521
Big enough for who?

837
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:28,120
The ants.

838
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:31,764
I'd like to get out of here,
but I ain't joining the Army to do it!

839
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,082
-You can't make me, there's laws!
-We know.

840
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,601
Jensen, what kind of ants did you see?

841
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,280
Big ones.

842
01:06:39,247 --> 01:06:40,726
Ain't there now.

843
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:43,277
-Mostly at night I see them.
-Where?

844
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:46,520
General, I'll make a deal with you:

845
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:49,758
If you make me a sergeant in charge
of the booze, and I'll enlist.

846
01:06:49,847 --> 01:06:51,883
Make me a sergeant
in charge of the booze!

847
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:54,435
Make me a sergeant
in charge of the booze!

848
01:06:54,527 --> 01:06:57,519
-Exactly where do these ants show up?
-In the river.

849
01:06:57,887 --> 01:06:59,206
In the river.

850
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,407
I saw it once when it had water in it.

851
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:04,405
Now, when was that?

852
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:06,646
Let me see.

853
01:07:08,727 --> 01:07:09,921
In the river bed.

854
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,882
Those big openings in the sides
are like sewer outlets.

855
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:17,927
Jensen, how long have you been
seeing these things?

856
01:07:18,007 --> 01:07:21,317
A long time. How long have I been here?

857
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:24,681
The doctor says he was first admitted
five months ago.

858
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:26,359
Thanks, Mac.

859
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:29,759
Take me with you and I'll enlist, I promise.

860
01:07:29,847 --> 01:07:31,075
Make me a sergeant!

861
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:34,005
Give me the booze!
Make me a sergeant. Give me the booze!

862
01:07:36,527 --> 01:07:39,166
Please, my nerves!

863
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:15,278
Which way is the hospital, Ryan?

864
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,805
Right over there.

865
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:29,565
Ben, come here.

866
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,166
Pretty good model of a kid's idea of an L-1.

867
01:08:40,647 --> 01:08:43,445
Get on the radio and contact Mrs. Lodge.

868
01:08:43,527 --> 01:08:46,883
Find out if the kids ever owned
a plane like that. Wait for a report.

869
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:48,116
Right.

870
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:18,325
Here's tire marks.

871
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:25,877
New tires. Lodge had new tires
on his car, didn't he?

872
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,156
Yeah.

873
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:29,886
Hey, Bob! Ben!

874
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,119
It's them all right.

875
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,038
I don't smell formic acid, do you?

876
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,595
No, but it could all fall right into place.

877
01:10:01,087 --> 01:10:03,999
Lodge and his kids
down here flying their model plane.

878
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:06,043
Suddenly, the ants attack.

879
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:08,397
Lodge fights to protect his kids.

880
01:10:09,087 --> 01:10:11,840
Somehow, he breaks away,
gets into his car, and drives off.

881
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:14,924
But what about the kids?

882
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:16,400
Maybe they ran away.

883
01:10:16,687 --> 01:10:18,439
No, we'd have picked them up by now.

884
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:21,718
Unless they ran in here.

885
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:23,796
Mr. Graham!

886
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,042
That model plane
belonged to the Lodge kids.

887
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:30,164
The husband used to bring
the boys down here to fly it.

888
01:10:30,447 --> 01:10:34,440
Got to be the same plane, same color.
And there's no model plane at home.

889
01:10:34,927 --> 01:10:37,919
Where do these things go?
I mean, how far do they go?

890
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:42,161
Don't know for sure, but there's more
than 700 miles of them under the city.

891
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:59,642
Why is the Army sending troops into L.A.?

892
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:01,604
And a Marine regiment from Pendleton?

893
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:04,565
Why a special press conference at 5:00
on a Sunday?

894
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:07,480
-You'll just have to wait.
-Why all the VIPs from Washington?

895
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,205
Has the cold war gotten hot?

896
01:11:09,287 --> 01:11:11,278
Gentlemen, come in now.

897
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:20,599
This is the most serious crisis
this city has ever faced.

898
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:23,156
There's no time for questions.
Listen carefully...

899
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:26,000
...so you can report the facts
to your newspapers.

900
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,404
This is Dr. Harold Medford
of the Department of Agriculture.

901
01:11:29,487 --> 01:11:32,285
Gen. O'Brien, Air Force Intelligence.

902
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:36,082
Gen. James, Army Intelligence.
The others you know.

903
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:38,199
-Ready, sir?
-One moment.

904
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:41,325
-Set, Charlie?
-You're on.

905
01:11:41,727 --> 01:11:45,561
We interrupt all radio and television
programs indefinitely.

906
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:50,682
Keep your radio and television sets
turned on. This is an emergency.

907
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:53,440
I repeat, this is an emergency!

908
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:57,520
"By direction of the President
of the United States...

909
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:01,396
"...and the Governor of the State
of California, and the Mayor...

910
01:12:01,847 --> 01:12:03,838
"...the city of Los Angeles is...

911
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:08,240
"...in the interests of public safety,
hereby under martial law.

912
01:12:12,447 --> 01:12:14,324
"Curfew is at 1800 hours.

913
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:19,524
"Any persons on the street or outside
their quarters after 6:00 p.m...

914
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,482
"...will be subject to arrest
by military police."

915
01:12:22,687 --> 01:12:25,485
<i>Now as for the reasons</i>
<i>for this most drastic decision:</i>

916
01:12:26,607 --> 01:12:30,566
<i>A couple of months ago in the New Mexico</i>
<i>desert, giant ants were discovered.</i>

917
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:35,807
<i>They're similar in appearance</i>
<i>to the ones you're familiar with.</i>

918
01:12:36,367 --> 01:12:41,043
<i>Except they are mutations,</i>
<i>ranging in size from 9 to 12 feet in length.</i>

919
01:12:41,647 --> 01:12:45,037
<i>The New Mexico colony was destroyed,</i>
<i>but two queen ants escaped.</i>

920
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:49,166
<i>One has been found and destroyed.</i>
<i>The other has not yet been found.</i>

921
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:55,757
<i>It has established a nest in the storm</i>
<i>drains beneath the streets of Los Angeles.</i>

922
01:12:55,887 --> 01:12:59,038
<i>It's not known how long this nest</i>
<i>has been established...</i>

923
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:02,120
<i>...or how many of these</i>
<i>lethal monsters have hatched.</i>

924
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:05,166
<i>Maybe a few, maybe thousands.</i>

925
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,720
<i>If new queen ants have hatched</i>
<i>and escaped this nest...</i>

926
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:12,557
<i>...other American cities may be in danger.</i>

927
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:15,237
<i>These creatures are extremely dangerous.</i>

928
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,203
<i>They've already killed</i>
<i>a number of persons.</i>

929
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:21,597
<i>Stay in your homes.</i>
<i>I repeat, stay in your homes!</i>

930
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:25,000
<i>Your personal safety,</i>
<i>the safety of the entire city...</i>

931
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:28,923
<i>...depends upon your full cooperation</i>
<i>with the military authorities.</i>

932
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,963
You got a pass to be down here, lady?

933
01:13:53,047 --> 01:13:56,483
-No, but I'm with Mrs. Lodge.
-This is a restricted area. Let's go.

934
01:13:56,567 --> 01:13:57,636
Hold it, Sergeant!

935
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,798
-This is the mother--
-They have no pass--

936
01:13:59,887 --> 01:14:02,003
Go talk to the general.

937
01:14:03,887 --> 01:14:05,366
Good evening, Mrs. Lodge.

938
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:08,764
-Is there any word yet?
-No, not yet.

939
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:11,361
We've got an awful lot of people
to help find them.

940
01:14:11,487 --> 01:14:14,843
-This may take awhile. Why not go home?
-Oh, no.

941
01:14:15,287 --> 01:14:19,246
-I want to be here when--
-Sure. Take it easy and try not to worry.

942
01:14:25,247 --> 01:14:27,477
Dr. Medford, since time is of the essence...

943
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:30,445
...I recommend we pour gasoline
into those drains and light it.

944
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,519
It'll burn out anything in there
and we can still control the fire...

945
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:36,041
...so there'll be no property damage
on the street.

946
01:14:36,127 --> 01:14:38,721
Any ants that get through,
the troops can take care of.

947
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,766
We can't do that until we know
whether those two kids are in there.

948
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:45,042
Think there's a chance they're still alive?

949
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,444
Are we supposed to jeopardize
the lives of everyone for children...

950
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:50,358
...who in all probability are already dead?

951
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:53,644
-Ask their mother that question.
-She's right over there.

952
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,086
I see what you mean.

953
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:04,125
We not only have her to think of,
but as I told you before...

954
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:07,597
...we can't risk fire until we know
if any new queens have hatched...

955
01:15:07,687 --> 01:15:10,599
...and flown out of this nest.
Where's Gen. O'Brien?

956
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:13,122
-He's over there by the command car.
-Thank you.

957
01:15:14,327 --> 01:15:16,477
-Can we start now, General?
-I think so.

958
01:15:16,687 --> 01:15:19,759
-How about it, Major?
-Waiting for more coverage to the north.

959
01:15:19,887 --> 01:15:22,082
Contact the northern units, soldier.

960
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:25,604
-Northern units come in.
-How about the south?

961
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,399
All drains as far as Long Beach...

962
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:29,398
...are covered by bazookas
or flamethrowers.

963
01:15:29,487 --> 01:15:32,160
-Openings of these drains?
-Police and Marines are covering.

964
01:15:32,247 --> 01:15:33,726
How about it, soldier?

965
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:35,998
Can't contact northern units, sir.

966
01:15:36,447 --> 01:15:38,199
Let's go ahead anyway.

967
01:15:38,447 --> 01:15:41,678
Gen. O'Brien to all search units:
Proceed into storm drains!

968
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:45,638
-Yes, sir?
-Get them moving.

969
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:47,524
Come on, boys, let's get rolling!

970
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:49,520
Roll them out of here!

971
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:00,239
Watch yourself, Bob.

972
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:34,440
Graham in drain 203.

973
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:38,879
<i>Graham in drain 203. In six-tenths</i>
<i>of a mile, nothing to report. Over.</i>

974
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:41,000
Medford in drain 207.

975
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:44,966
<i>Medford in drain 207.</i>
<i>In half of a mile. Nothing to report, over.</i>

976
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:46,646
Peterson in drain 223.

977
01:17:46,727 --> 01:17:50,800
<i>Peterson in 223, we're in six-tenths</i>
<i>of a mile. Nothing to report, over.</i>

978
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:52,600
<i>This is Kibbee in drain 192.</i>

979
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:57,243
Repeat, Kibbee in 192, in eight-tenths.
Nothing to report, over.

980
01:18:02,127 --> 01:18:03,719
Wait a minute, hold it.

981
01:18:04,407 --> 01:18:05,681
Kill the motor.

982
01:18:11,247 --> 01:18:12,839
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

983
01:18:15,127 --> 01:18:17,402
This is Peterson! Stop all motors!

984
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,880
<i>This is Peterson! Stop all motors!</i>

985
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:41,124
This is Peterson in drain 223.

986
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:44,916
<i>Peterson in drain 223. We're in</i>
<i>just over a mile. I think I hear something.</i>

987
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:51,764
There it is again. Stand by.

988
01:19:00,727 --> 01:19:02,479
Where does this thing go?

989
01:19:06,647 --> 01:19:10,162
That pipe runs into a main line drain
that isn't finished yet.

990
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:11,965
Still in the construction stage.

991
01:19:17,047 --> 01:19:18,526
Give me a hand.

992
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,246
Tell them where I'm going.

993
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:30,962
Peterson is going through
the connecting feeder to drain 267.

994
01:19:31,247 --> 01:19:35,525
<i>We've heard what may be the kids.</i>
<i>Repeat, we've heard what may be the kids.</i>

995
01:19:35,847 --> 01:19:36,836
<i>Stand by.</i>

996
01:19:39,127 --> 01:19:41,402
-There's construction down there?
-Yeah.

997
01:19:41,487 --> 01:19:45,241
-Tell O'Brien to turn the work lights on.
-Right.

998
01:19:46,847 --> 01:19:49,839
My map shows a portion of drain 267
is unfinished...

999
01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:52,805
...with construction postponed
for the last 60 days.

1000
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:57,722
<i>If they've left work lights installed,</i>
<i>turn them on. Stand by.</i>

1001
01:20:26,807 --> 01:20:30,083
Mike? Jerry? Are you there?

1002
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:33,125
-Yes, we're here!
-Schmitty, they're alive!

1003
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:34,117
They're alive.

1004
01:20:34,327 --> 01:20:36,443
<i>Tell Mrs. Lodge her boys are alive.</i>

1005
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:53,677
Mike, Jerry, stay where you are!
We'll get you out, but don't move!

1006
01:20:54,207 --> 01:20:55,879
There's two ants in here.

1007
01:20:56,007 --> 01:20:59,636
I got a strong brood odor,
like in the New Mexico nest!

1008
01:21:00,087 --> 01:21:04,126
Report that to O'Brien.
Tell him I must be near the nest.

1009
01:21:04,207 --> 01:21:07,597
I can't use the flamethrower.
The kids are right in the line of fire.

1010
01:21:07,687 --> 01:21:09,564
Tell O'Brien to send in troops.

1011
01:21:17,647 --> 01:21:20,957
<i>Peterson says it has the same smell</i>
<i>as the nest in New Mexico.</i>

1012
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:24,357
<i>"Brood odor," he calls it.</i>
<i>He asks for troops to be sent in.</i>

1013
01:21:24,527 --> 01:21:26,119
He's found the nest!

1014
01:21:26,327 --> 01:21:30,479
To all units, condition red.
Drain 267 is the target area!

1015
01:21:30,567 --> 01:21:33,525
Repeat, condition red.
Drain 267 is the target area!

1016
01:22:07,807 --> 01:22:10,640
Repeat, condition red.
Drain 267 is the target area.

1017
01:22:10,727 --> 01:22:14,117
O'Connors, bring up my jeep.
I hope we've found this nest in time.

1018
01:22:43,807 --> 01:22:45,525
Mike, Jerry, get in the corner!

1019
01:22:56,887 --> 01:22:59,162
Come on Jerry, Mike, let's get out of here!

1020
01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:02,360
Come on, Mike.

1021
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:07,202
We're going through this pipe.
There's a man at the other end.

1022
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:10,404
Keep crawling until you get down there.
Understand?

1023
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:12,962
Grab hold. Go on.

1024
01:23:13,647 --> 01:23:15,683
Keep crawling, to the other end.

1025
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:47,125
Put your light over there!

1026
01:23:56,487 --> 01:23:57,715
Keep at them!

1027
01:24:04,647 --> 01:24:05,636
Ben.

1028
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:10,727
-How about the kids, Ben?
-They're okay.

1029
01:24:12,007 --> 01:24:12,996
The pipe....

1030
01:24:16,287 --> 01:24:17,515
Medics!

1031
01:24:55,487 --> 01:24:58,081
-Stop the firing!
-Cease fire!

1032
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:00,840
No more explosives,
we can't risk closing off the nest.

1033
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:02,645
Is there any type of gas we can use?

1034
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:05,076
We can't take a chance,
might poison the whole city.

1035
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:09,365
We must locate the egg chamber,
find out if any new queens have hatched.

1036
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:30,006
Medics!

1037
01:25:52,887 --> 01:25:54,445
Start digging, you guys.

1038
01:26:01,967 --> 01:26:03,844
Hurry up, dig.

1039
01:27:17,807 --> 01:27:20,321
Hold it. Don't burn anything
until we get the okay.

1040
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:22,557
-General, where's Dr. Medford?
-He's coming.

1041
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:33,166
Is this it, Doctor?

1042
01:27:34,127 --> 01:27:36,277
New princess ants. New queens.

1043
01:27:37,807 --> 01:27:41,880
This is the egg chamber.
The same as we found in New Mexico.

1044
01:27:43,607 --> 01:27:44,960
Are we too late?

1045
01:27:45,447 --> 01:27:47,119
Fortunately, we're in time.

1046
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:50,006
I'm certain no new queens have escaped
from this nest.

1047
01:27:50,247 --> 01:27:52,636
The job will be done
when these are destroyed.

1048
01:27:53,047 --> 01:27:54,321
Okay, burn them out.

1049
01:28:01,447 --> 01:28:05,679
Pat, if these monsters are a result
of the first atomic bomb in 1945...

1050
01:28:06,087 --> 01:28:08,726
...what about all the others
that have been exploded since then?

1051
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:09,796
I don't know.

1052
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:11,646
Nobody knows, Robert.

1053
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:16,885
When man entered the atomic age,
he opened a door into a new world.

1054
01:28:17,927 --> 01:28:22,000
What we'll eventually find
in that new world, nobody can predict.
