1
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:06,214
- (people yelling)
- (radio chatter)

2
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:09,133
Hey hey.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,678
Ma'am. Ma'am, please.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,554
- Please, can you help me?
- No no no!

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,264
- (siren wailing)
- (gunshots)

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,101
Man:
Check them all. Check them all.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,853
(helicopter passing)

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,188
(screams)

9
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,283
- (growling)
- (man screaming)

10
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,374
(gunshots)

11
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,543
(panting)

12
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,548
- Okay.
- (heart monitor beeping)

13
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,633
I'm gonna get you
out of here, bud.

14
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,593
- (gunshots)
- (grunts)

15
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,681
- (helicopter passing)
- Okay. Okay.

16
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,233
What do I do?

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,026
(door opens)

18
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,449
Man:
Come on, corporal. Move out!

19
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,578
(gunfire)

20
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,621
(pounds, grunts)

21
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,332
(helicopter passes)

22
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,881
Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up,
I need you to do it now.

23
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,466
Okay? Now.

24
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,843
Please, man,
you just show me a sign. Anything.

25
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,013
- Please, Rick.
- (explosion)

26
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,056
(power whirring down)

27
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,310
Man:
The place is coming down!

28
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,812
Fall back!
All units fall back.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,814
(guns firing)

30
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,900
(grunts)

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,120
(crying) I'm...

32
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm okay.

33
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,713
(people yelling)

34
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,884
- (gunfire)
- (woman screams)

35
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,762
(growling)

36
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,504
(theme music playing)

37
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,752
Shane:
Daryl, you cover the back.

38
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,924
Rick: Hello?

39
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,427
- Hello?
- Shane: Close those doors.

40
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,761
Watch for walkers.

41
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,562
- Rick: Hello?
- (gun cocks)

42
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,066
Anybody infected?

43
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,235
One of our group was.

44
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,905
He didn't make it.

45
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,575
Jenner: Why are you here?
What do you want?

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,286
A chance.

47
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,080
That's asking
an awful lot these days.

48
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,459
I know.

49
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,347
You all submit to a blood test.

50
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,890
That's the price of admission.

51
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,975
We can do that.

52
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,520
You got stuff to bring in,
you do it now.

53
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,814
Once this door closes,
it stays closed.

54
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,822
- (beeps)
- Vi, seal the main entrance.

55
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,783
Kill the power up here.

56
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,744
(rattles, clangs)

57
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,955
(beeps)

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,374
Rick Grimes.

59
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,168
Dr. Edwin Jenner.

60
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,046
(elevator humming)

61
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,216
Doctors always go around
packing heat like that?

62
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,678
There were plenty left lying around.
I familiarized myself.

63
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,974
But you look harmless enough.

64
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,392
Except you.

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,144
I'll have to keep my eye on you.

66
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,690
(chuckles)

67
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,654
Carol:
Are we underground?

68
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,364
Jenner:
Are you claustrophobic?

69
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,325
- A little.
- Try not to think about it.

70
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,083
Vi, bring up the lights
in the big room.

71
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,252
(humming, beeping)

72
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,133
Welcome to zone 5.

73
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,719
Where is everybody?

74
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,887
The other doctors, the staff?

75
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,559
I'm it.

76
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,561
It's just me here.

77
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,856
What about the person
you were speaking with?

78
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,483
Vi?

79
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,903
Jenner:
Vi, say hello to our guests.

80
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,282
Tell them... welcome.

81
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,160
Computer:
Hello, guests. Welcome.

82
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,288
I'm all that's left.

83
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,585
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,632
Andrea: What's the point?
If we were infected,

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,426
we'd all be running a fever.

86
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,721
I've already broken every rule
in the book letting you in here.

87
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,223
Let me just at least be thorough.

88
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,435
- (syringe clicks)
- Jenner: All done.

89
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,856
- Ooh.
- Jenner: Are you okay?

90
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,150
- Mmm.
- She hasn't eaten in days.

91
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,444
None of us have.

92
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,449
- (all laughing)
- Fine.

93
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,950
You know, in Italy,

94
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,621
children have a little bit
of wine with dinner.

95
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,206
And in France.

96
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, when Carl is
in Italy or France,

97
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,669
- he can have some then.
- What's it gonna hurt? Come on.

98
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,505
- Come on.
- (Dale laughs)

99
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,882
- What?
- (laughing)

100
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,553
Dale:
There you are, young lad.

101
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,057
(chuckles)

102
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,684
- Eww.
- (adults laughing)

103
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,812
That's my boy. That's my boy.

104
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,273
- Good boy.
- Yuck.

105
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,484
- That tastes nasty.
- (laughing continues)

106
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,945
Well, just stick
to soda pop there, bud.

107
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,947
- Daryl: Not you, Glenn.
- What?

108
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,825
Keep drinking, little man. I want
to see how red your face can get.

109
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,786
(men laughing)

110
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,874
(clinks glass)

111
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,502
It seems to me we haven't
thanked our host properly.

112
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,629
He is more than just our host.

113
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,841
- Hear hear!
- Here's to you, doc. Booyah!

114
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,509
- Men: Booyah!
- Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

115
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,970
- T-Dog: Booyah!
- (glasses clink)

116
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,056
So when are you gonna tell us
what the hell happened here, doc?

117
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,103
All the-- the other doctors

118
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,148
that were supposed to be
figuring out what happened,

119
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,775
- where are they?
- Rick: We're celebrating, Shane.

120
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,319
Don't need to do this now.

121
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,698
Whoa, wait a second.
This is why we're here, right?

122
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,242
This was your move--

123
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,202
supposed to find all the answers.

124
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,079
Instead we--
(chuckles)

125
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,456
we found him.

126
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,459
Found one man. Why?

127
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,629
Jenner:
Well, when things got bad,

128
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,174
a lot of people just left,

129
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,635
went off to be
with their families.

130
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,929
And when things got worse,

131
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,724
when the military cordon
got overrun,

132
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,475
the rest bolted.

133
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,978
Every last one?

134
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:45,274
No, many couldn't face
walking out the door.

135
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,362
They... opted out.

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,574
There was a rash of suicides.

137
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,662
That was a bad time.

138
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,164
You didn't leave.

139
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,041
Why?

140
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,043
I just kept working,

141
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,588
hoping to do some good.

142
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,553
Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man.

143
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,892
Most of the facility is powered down

144
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,436
including housing,
so you'll have to make do here.

145
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,521
The couches are comfortable,

146
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,899
but there are cots
in storage if you like.

147
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,195
There's a rec room down the hall
that you kids might enjoy.

148
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,198
Just don't plug in
the video games, okay?

149
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,076
Or anything that draws power.
The same applies--

150
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,245
if you shower,
go easy on the hot water.

151
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,624
Hot water?

152
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,502
- That's what the man said.
- (both laugh)

153
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,716
(knob squeaks)

154
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,477
(laughing)

155
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,480
Ah!

156
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,978
- Dale: Hey.
- (Andrea vomiting)

157
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,026
(sobs)

158
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,529
(coughs)

159
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,533
- Andrea?
- (vomits)

160
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,702
- Andrea.
- (sobbing)

161
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,749
That's it.

162
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,376
That's it. Get it out.

163
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,005
There you go.

164
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,051
Oh... God.

165
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,053
(flushes)

166
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,056
(sobbing)

167
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,226
Oh.

168
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,105
Everything's gone.

169
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,399
It's always better going down
than coming up, huh?

170
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,651
I don't mean the wine, Dale.

171
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,073
You know, it's over.
There's nothing left.

172
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,617
Don't you see that?

173
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,453
Oh, I-- I see a--

174
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,456
a chance to make a new start.

175
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,916
(laughs)

176
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,959
Oh my God, Dale.

177
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,505
Dale, didn't you see
the look on Jenner's face?

178
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,758
Hear what I'm saying.

179
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,677
There's nothing left.

180
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,266
(knocks)

181
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,436
How's the blood?

182
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,772
No surprises.

183
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,657
I came to thank you.

184
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,953
You did.

185
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,374
You all-- you all right?

186
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,001
You don't know what it's like.

187
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,795
(laughs)

188
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,089
You don't know
what it's like out there.

189
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,134
You may think you do,
but you don't.

190
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,763
We'd have died out there.

191
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,143
It was only a matter of time.

192
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,270
There's too many of those things.

193
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,400
My-- my boy...

194
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,738
my-- my wife, I never--

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,535
I never told 'em
what I really thought.

196
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,791
I never even hinted, just--

197
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,173
just kept it in.

198
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,677
Kept it in and kept us
moving, you know.

199
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,013
Just kept it in. Kept us--

200
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,765
It'll all be okay.

201
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,354
It'll be okay.

202
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,072
(chuckling)

203
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,119
- Any good books?
- Carol: Uh-huh.

204
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,080
- (book closes)
- Enough to keep us busy for years.

205
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,249
All right.
Come on, kids, it's bedtime.

206
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,920
Baby, go say your prayers.
I'm gonna browse a bit.

207
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,922
Carol:
Come on.

208
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,841
This is the first night we might
actually get some real sleep.

209
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,093
- Lori: Hmm.
- It's a miracle, isn't it?

210
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,614
(slams door)

211
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,742
(sighs)

212
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,702
Jesus, you scared me.

213
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,038
I'm gonna tell you a few things

214
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,957
and you're gonna listen to me.

215
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,542
Now is not the time.

216
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,169
(chuckles)
Come on. When is it ever the time?

217
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,217
How can you treat me like this?

218
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,052
- You're kidding, right?
- No. Huh-uh.

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,054
Because you told me
my husband was dead.

220
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,306
Jesus, Lori. I didn't lie
to you, all right? I didn't.

221
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,809
Do you know
what it was like there?

222
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,980
Stop. Things were falling apart.

223
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,274
They were slaughtering
people in the hallways.

224
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,151
It was a massacre.
There were walkers everywhere.

225
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,070
- So you left him?
- Everybody else ran.

226
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,614
There were no doctors there.
It was just me.

227
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,993
He was hooked up to machines
and I did not know what to do.

228
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
I even took my ear
and I put it on his chest

229
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,039
and I listened for a heartbeat
and I did not hear one.

230
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,583
And I-I-I-I--
I don't know why.

231
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,459
Maybe it was gunfire.
I don't know what it was,

232
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,670
but there was no way
he could've survived that. No way.

233
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,005
- He did.
- Yeah,

234
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,674
but then I had y'all to think about,
didn't I? I had you and Carl,

235
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,175
- and I needed to think about--
- Okay. No no.

236
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,719
I had to get you guys
safe to Atlanta.

237
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,262
That's what I had to do. Just stop.

238
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,847
If you thought for one second

239
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,391
that he was still alive,
would you have come?

240
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,351
So I saved your life--

241
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,895
you and your little boy's.
That's what I did.

242
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,689
Right?

243
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,150
Okay.

244
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,570
And if I could've traded places
with him, I would have.

245
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,990
I would trade places
with him right now because--

246
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,492
- No no no. No.
- No no no, you--

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,785
- I love you. Shh shh.
- No. No, you're drunk.

248
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,495
- I love you.
- No, you're drunk.

249
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,664
And I know there were some things
that say that you love me too,

250
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,042
because there's no way that you could've
been with me the way that you were.

251
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,169
- Shane. Shane. Shane!
- Just-- okay, stop.

252
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:05,213
- Listen. You love me.
- Get your hands off me.

253
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,215
- I love you. There's nobody here.
- Please! Ah!

254
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,593
Stop, Lori.
It's all right. Just--

255
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,928
(groans)

256
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,068
(pounds wall)

257
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,528
(sobbing)

258
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,676
- (belt buckle rattles)
- (shoes clatter)

259
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,268
(switch clicks)

260
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,491
(crying)

261
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,707
(whispering)
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

262
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,795
We're safe here.

263
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,630
All right?

264
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,262
(sniffling)

265
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,310
Glenn: Hello.

266
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,772
- Rick: Morning.
- Are you hungover?

267
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,652
- Mom said you'd be.
- Mom is right.

268
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,363
Mom has that annoying habit.

269
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:57,951
Eggs. Powdered, but--
but I do 'em good.

270
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,454
- (Glenn moans)
- T-Dog: I bet you can't tell.

271
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,624
- Protein helps the hangover.
- (moaning)

272
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,334
Where'd all this come from?

273
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,170
- Jenner.
- Rick: Could you help me, please?

274
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,005
He thought we could use it.

275
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,840
- Rick: Thank you.
- Some of us, at least.

276
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,760
Don't ever ever ever
let me drink again.

277
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,012
- Shane: Hey.
- Hey.

278
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,932
Rick:
Feel as bad as I do?

279
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,851
Worse.

280
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,355
The hell happened to you?

281
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,316
Your neck?

282
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,067
I must have done it in my sleep.

283
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,736
Never seen you do that before.

284
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,696
Me neither.

285
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,199
Not like me at all.

286
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,539
- Jenner: Morning.
- Shane: Hey, doc.

287
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,376
Doctor, I don't mean to slam you
with questions first thing--

288
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,295
But you will anyway.

289
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,547
We didn't come here
for the eggs.

290
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,434
- (clicks, beeps)
- Give me playback of TS-19.

291
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,520
Vi:
Playback of TS-19.

292
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,855
(beeping)

293
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,733
Jenner: Few people
ever got a chance to see this.

294
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,860
Very few.

295
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,370
- Is that a brain?
- An extraordinary one.

296
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,374
Not that it matters in the end.

297
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,875
Take us in for EIV.

298
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,545
Vi:
Enhanced internal view.

299
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,563
What are those lights?

300
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,358
Jenner:
It's a person's life--

301
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,110


experiences, memories.

302
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,237
It's everything.

303
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,906
Somewhere in
all that organic wiring,

304
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,367
all those ripples of light,

305
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,411


is you--

306
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,038
the thing that makes you unique.

307
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,583
And human.

308
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,960
You don't make sense ever?

309
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,503
Those are synapses,

310
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,297
electric impulses in the brain

311
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,299
that carry all the messages.

312
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,093
They determine
everything a person says

313
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,138
does or thinks
from the moment of birth

314
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,098
to the moment of death.

315
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,393
Death? That's what
this is, a vigil?

316
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,228
Yes.

317
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:35,317
Or rather
the playback of the vigil.

318
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,403
This person died?

319
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,114
Who?

320
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,825
Jenner:
Test Subject 19.

321
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,370
Someone who was bitten

322
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,664
and infected...

323
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,959
and volunteered to have us

324
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,211
record the process.

325
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,383
Vi, scan forward
to the first event.

326
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,929
- Vi: Scanning to first event.
- (beeping)

327
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,770
What is that?

328
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,149
It invades the brain
like meningitis.

329
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,986
The adrenal glands hemorrhage,

330
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,863
the brain goes into shutdown,

331
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,990
then the major organs.

332
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,663
Then death.

333
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,750
Everything you ever were
or ever will be...

334
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,213
gone.

335
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,507
Is that what happened to Jim?

336
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,550
Yes.

337
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,395
Lori:
She lost somebody two days ago.

338
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,146
Her sister.

339
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,983
I lost somebody too.

340
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,694
I know how devastating it is.

341
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,701
Scan to
the second event.

342
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,995
Vi:
Scanning to second event.

343
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,915
Jenner:
The resurrection times vary wildly.

344
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,709
We had reports of it happening

345
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,961
in as little as three minutes.

346
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,255
The longest we heard of
was eight hours.

347
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,882
In the case of this patient,

348
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,719
it was two hours, one minute...

349
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,139
seven seconds.

350
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,902
- It restarts the brain?
- No, just the brain stem.

351
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,114
Basically,
it gets them up and moving.

352
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,158
But they're not alive?

353
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,619
You tell me.

354
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,873
It's nothing like before.

355
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,208
Most of that brain is dark.

356
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,045
Jenner:
Dark, lifeless, dead.

357
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,671
The frontal lobe, the neocortex,

358
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,048
the human part--
that doesn't come back.

359
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,050
The you part.

360
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,927
Just a shell

361
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,513
driven by mindless instinct.

362
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,685
God. What was that?

363
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,105
He shot his patient in the head.

364
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,234
Didn't you?

365
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,278
Jenner:
Vi, power down the main screen

366
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,780
and the workstations.

367
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,116
Vi: Powering down
main screen and workstations.

368
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,954
You have no idea
what it is, do you?

369
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,250
It could be microbial,

370
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,252
viral, parasitic,

371
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,380
- fungal.
- Or the wrath of God?

372
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,842
There is that.

373
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,844
Andrea:
Somebody must know something.

374
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,596
Somebody somewhere.

375
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,974
Carol: There are others, right?
Other facilities?

376
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,394
There may be some.

377
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,688
People like me.

378
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,732
But you don't know?
How can you not know?

379
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,275
Jenner:
Everything went down.

380
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,319
Communications,
directives-- all of it.

381
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,364
I've been in the dark
for almost a month.

382
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,491
So it's not just here.

383
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,286
There's nothing left
anywhere? Nothing?

384
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,997
That's what
you're really saying, right?

385
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,676
Jesus.

386
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,886
Man, I'm gonna get
shit-faced drunk again.

387
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,722
Dr. Jenner, I know this
has been taxing for you

388
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,059
and I hate to ask
one more question, but...

389
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,895
that clock--

390
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,064
it's counting down.

391
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,110
What happens at zero?

392
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:54,033
The basement generators--
they run out of fuel.

393
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,871
And then?

394
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,334
Vi, what happens
when the power runs out?

395
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,587
Vi:
When the power runs out,

396
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,549
facility-wide
decontamination will occur.

397
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,511
(beeps)

398
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,930
Glenn: Decontamination--
what does that mean?

399
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,057
Shane: I don't like
the way Jenner clammed up.

400
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,393
The way he just
wandered off like that.

401
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,104
What's wrong with him?
Seriously, man,

402
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,898
is he nuts, medicated or what?

403
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,401
In there.

404
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,075
- (beeps)
- (lights humming)

405
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,162
Check that way.

406
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,872
Shane.

407
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,098
(chugging)

408
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,857
It's empty.

409
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,526
- (sighs)
- (generator clacks)

410
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,696
- Vi: Emergency lighting on.
- What the hell is this?

411
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,952
Hey, you guys kill the lights?

412
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,120
- Nah, it just went out.
- Rick: Anything?

413
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,749
T-Dog:
Yeah, a lot of dead generators

414
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,335
and more empty fuel drums
than I can count.

415
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,673
It can't be down to just that one.

416
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,476
Mom? Something wrong?

417
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,688
Nothing. It's just...

418
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,983
the air conditioning stopped.

419
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,625
(sighs, sniffles)

420
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,420
I did the best I could
in the time that I had.

421
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,008
I hope you'd be proud of that.

422
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,989
We always think
there's gonna be more time...

423
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,367
(power whirs down)

424
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,747
...then it runs out.

425
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,958
Carol:
Why is the air off?

426
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,502
- And the lights in our room?
- Daryl: What's going on?

427
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,087
Why is everything turned off?

428
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,881
Energy use is being prioritized.

429
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,342
Dale:
Air isn't a priority? And lights?

430
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,553
It's not up to me.
Zone 5 is shutting itself down.

431
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,764
Daryl: Hey! Hey, what the hell
does that mean?

432
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,266
- (power whirs down)
- Hey, man, I'm talking to you.

433
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,935
What do you mean
it's shutting itself down?

434
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,729
How can a building do anything?

435
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,397
- Jenner: You'd be surprised.
- Rick?

436
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,071
Jenner, what's happening?

437
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,407
The system is dropping all
the nonessential uses of power.

438
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:24,911
It's designed to keep the computers
running to the last possible second.

439
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,205
That started as we approached
the half-hour mark.

440
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,207
Right on schedule.

441
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,262
- It was the French.
- What?

442
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,223
They were the last ones
to hold out as far as I know.

443
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,266
While our people were
bolting out the doors

444
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,935
and committing suicide
in the hallways,

445
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,478
they stayed in the labs till the end.

446
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,898
They thought
they were close to a solution.

447
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,775
What happened?

448
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,069
Jenner: The same thing
that's happening here.

449
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,446
No power grid.

450
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,907
Ran out of juice.

451
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,120
The world runs on fossil fuel.

452
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,163
I mean,
how stupid is that?

453
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,125
- Shane: Let me tell you--
- Rick: To hell with it. I don't care.

454
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,627
Lori, grab our things.
Everybody, get your stuff.

455
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,754
We're getting out of here now!

456
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,506
Oh, okay.

457
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,466
- (alarm blaring)
- What's that?

458
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,470
What's that?

459
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,557
Vi:
30 minutes to decontamination.

460
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,895
Daryl:
Doc, what's going on here, damn it?

461
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,647
Shane:
Everybody, y'all heard Rick.

462
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,357
Get your stuff and let's go!
Go now! Go!

463
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,817
- Let's go.
- Glenn: Come on!

464
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,695
(whirs, clangs)

465
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,029
No.

466
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,324
Did you just lock us in?

467
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,368
He just locked us in!

468
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,246
We've hit the 30-minute window.
I am recording.

469
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,833
- Carl.
- Carl: Mom!

470
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,585
- You son of a bitch.
- Shane!

471
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,587
- You locked us in here!
- No, stop. Don't!

472
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,423
- You locked us in here!
- Shane: No no no no! Don't!

473
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,383
Wait, no!
No, don't do it.

474
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,346
Hey, Jenner,
open that door now.

475
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,765
There's no point.
Everything topside is locked down.

476
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,267
The emergency exits are sealed.

477
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,768
Dale:
Well, open the damn things.

478
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,021
That's not something I control.
The computers do.

479
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:18,024
I told you once
that front door closed,

480
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,359
it wouldn't open again.
You heard me say that.

481
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,156
- It's better this way.
- What is?

482
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,533
What happens in 28 minutes?

483
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,202
(keyboard clacks)

484
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,705
- What happens in 28 minutes?!
- Daryl: Come on!

485
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,208
Do you know what this place is?!

486
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,710
We protected the public

487
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,671
from very nasty stuff!

488
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,717
Weaponized smallpox!

489
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,970
Ebola strains that could
wipe out half the country!

490
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,307
Stuff you don't want
getting out! Ever!

491
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,739
In the event
of a catastrophic power failure--

492
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,408
in a terrorist attack,
for example--

493
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,828
HITs are deployed to prevent
any organisms from getting out.

494
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,122
HITs?

495
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,793
- Vi, define.
- Vi: HITs--

496
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,587
high-impulse thermobaric
fuel-air explosives

497
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,507
consist of a two-stage
aerosol ignition

498
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,802
that produces a blast wave
of significantly greater power

499
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,845
and duration than
any other known explosive

500
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,472
except nuclear.

501
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,433
The vacuum-pressure effect
ignites the oxygen

502
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,894
at between 5,000° and 6,000°

503
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,397
and is useful when
the greatest loss of life

504
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,941
and damage
to structures is desired.

505
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,277
It sets the air on fire.

506
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,657
No pain.

507
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,158
(both crying)

508
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,953
Jenner:
An end to sorrow, grief...

509
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,498
regret.

510
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,717
Everything.

511
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,184
Open the damn door!

512
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,605
Out of my way!

513
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,231
- (grunts)
- T-Dog: Daryl!

514
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,735
(both pounding, grunting)

515
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,904
(crying)

516
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,366
You should've
left well enough alone.

517
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,369
- It would've been so much easier.
- Lori: Easier for who?

518
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,371
All of you.
You know what's out there--

519
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,375
a short, brutal life
and an agonizing death.

520
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:45,671
Your-- your sister--
what was her name?

521
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,381
- Amy.
- Jenner: Amy.

522
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,592
You know what this does.

523
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,885
You've seen it.

524
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,304
Is that really what you want
for your wife and son?

525
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,514
(emphatically)
I don't want this.

526
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,850
- (axe bangs)
- Can't make a dent.

527
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,519
Those doors are designed
to withstand a rocket launcher.

528
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,563
- Well, your head ain't!
- Rick: Whoa! Whoa!

529
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,523
Daryl! Daryl!

530
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:08,319
Just back up! Back up!

531
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,780
Jenner:
You do want this.

532
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,198
Last night you said

533
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,866
you knew it was just
a matter of time

534
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,701
before everybody
you loved was dead.

535
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,037
What?

536
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,874
What?
You really said that?

537
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,542
After all your big talk?

538
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,252
I had to keep
hope alive, didn't I?

539
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,046
Jenner:
There is no hope.

540
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,215
- There never was.
- There's always hope.

541
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,092
Maybe it won't be you,
maybe not here,

542
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,718
but somebody somewhere--

543
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,388
What part of "everything is gone"
do you not understand?

544
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,807
Jenner:
Listen to your friend. She gets it.

545
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,601
This is what takes us down.

546
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,772
This is
our extinction event.

547
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,484
(crying continues)

548
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,945
Carol:
This isn't right.

549
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:53,447
You can't just keep us here.

550
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,242
One tiny moment--

551
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,244
a millisecond. No pain.

552
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:01,956
My daughter doesn't deserve
to die like this.

553
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,420
Wouldn't it be kinder,

554
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,923
more compassionate
to just hold your loved ones

555
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:14,260
- and wait for the clock to run down?
- (gun cocks)

556
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,928
- Shane, no!
- Out of the way, Rick!

557
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,431
Stay out of my way!
Open that door

558
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,266
or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Do you hear me?!

559
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,352
Brother, brother,
this is not the way you do this.

560
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,855
- We will never get out of here.
- Shane, you listen to him.

561
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,191
- Shane: It's too late.
- He dies, we all--

562
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,444
- (yelling)
- --we all die! Shane!

563
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,784
Shane!

564
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,828
(grunts)

565
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,749
(panting)

566
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,671
Are you done now?
Are you done?

567
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,840
Yeah, I guess we all are.

568
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,989
I think you're lying.

569
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,535
- What?
- Rick: You're lying

570
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,246
about no hope.

571
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,791
If that were true,
you'd have bolted with the rest

572
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,835
or taken the easy way out.
You didn't.

573
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,464
You chose the hard path.

574
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,341
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

575
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,093
It does matter.
It always matters.

576
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,096
You stayed when others ran.

577
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,350
- Why?
- Not because I wanted to.

578
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,685
I made a promise...

579
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,897
to her.

580
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,274
My wife.

581
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,905
Test subject 19
was your wife?

582
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,283
Jenner: She begged me
to keep going as long as I could.

583
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,578
- How could I say no?
- (pounding)

584
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:07,289
She was dying.

585
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,708
It should've been me
on that table.

586
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,168
I wouldn't have
mattered to anybody.

587
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,505
She was a loss to the world.

588
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,383
Hell, she ran this place.
I just worked here.

589
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,969
In our field, she was an Einstein.

590
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,515
Me? I'm just... Edwin Jenner.

591
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,560
She could've done
something about this.

592
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,854
Not me.

593
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,606
Your wife didn't have a choice.

594
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:37,027
You do.
That's-- that's all we want--

595
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,865
a choice, a chance.

596
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,491
(Daryl grunting)

597
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,536
Let us keep trying
as long as we can.

598
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,880
I told you topside's locked down.
I can't open those.

599
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,514
(beeping)

600
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,727
Come on!

601
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,564
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

602
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,692
- Daryl: Come on!
- T-Dog: Move it! Move it!

603
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,320
- Daryl: Come on, let's go!
- Carol: We're gonna get out of here.

604
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,071
There's your chance. Take it.

605
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,449
I'm grateful.

606
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,910
- The day will come when you won't be.
- Glenn: Let's go!

607
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,416
(whispering)

608
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,843
Hey, we've got four minutes left!
Come on!

609
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,596
- Let's go. Let's go, Jacqui.
- No no, I'm staying.

610
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,556
I'm staying, sweetie.

611
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,142
- But that's insane!
- No, it's completely sane.

612
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,436
For the first time
in a long time.

613
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,064
I'm not ending up
like Jim and Amy.

614
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,401
There's no time to argue

615
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,237
and no point,
not if you want to get out.

616
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,448
Just get out. Get out.

617
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,826
T-Dog. Come on, man.

618
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,662
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

619
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:19,296
I'm staying too.

620
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,174
Andrea, no.

621
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,262
- Just go! Go!
- Shane: Come on.

622
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,856
Andrea,

623
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,985
this isn't what
Amy would want for you.

624
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,279
She's dead,
and you need to leave.

625
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,247
- Glenn: Get them doors open!
- T-Dog: Come on!

626
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:56,583
- Glenn: It doesn't work!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

627
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,503
- Try it! Try it! Try it now!
- Shane: Daryl!

628
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,591
- Daryl: Come on! Come on!
- Stay close, sweetheart.

629
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,844
(grunting)

630
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,556
Time's almost up.

631
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,893
Daryl, look out!
(yelling)

632
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,528
Dog, get down! Get down!

633
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,575
- Jesus.
- Sophia: The glass won't break?

634
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,078
Rick, I have something
that might help.

635
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,081
Carol, I don't think
a nail file's gonna do it.

636
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,083
Your first morning at camp,

637
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,712
when I washed your uniform
I found this in your pocket.

638
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,008
Come on.

639
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,719
Glenn:
Look out!

640
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,811
Oh, sh--

641
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,438
- Get down! Get down!
- Shit!

642
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,940
(glass shatters)

643
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,948
Okay.

644
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,785
You win.

645
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,962
- What are you doing?
- I said okay.

646
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,218
- Don't pull this, Dale.
- I'm not pulling anything.

647
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,804
If you're staying, I stay too.

648
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,973
He's right. We know
what's waiting for us out there.

649
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,101
I don't want to face it alone.

650
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,062
Dale, get the hell out.

651
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,481
I don't want you here.

652
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,484
Too bad.
See, you don't get to do that,

653
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,653
to-- to come into somebody's life,

654
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,447
make them care
and then just check out.

655
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,996
I'm staying.

656
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,959
The matter is settled.

657
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,172
(zombies growling)

658
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,979
(grunts)

659
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,064
(panting)

660
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,241
Wait wait wait. Wait wait.

661
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,909
They're coming.

662
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,378
(computer beeping)

663
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,506
They got out.

664
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,193
Lori:
Come on.

665
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,154
- (horn honks)
- Dale, get down! Down!

666
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:16,033
Get back!
Everybody down! Down!

667
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,828
Get down!

668
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,336
(exhales)

669
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,803

671
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,599
Come on. Come on.
Get in, get in, get in.

672
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,476
