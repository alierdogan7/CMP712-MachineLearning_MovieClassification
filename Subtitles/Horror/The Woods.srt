1
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:52,526
Feet off the seat.

2
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:40,205
You see, Joe?
lt's absolutely beautiful here.

3
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,641
What type of trees are those?

4
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:48,037
They look like they're the same
as the one that was in our yard.

5
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,481
Don't you think?

6
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,720
Mind the paint, dear.

7
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,603
-Hello.
-Heather?

8
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,001
We didn't see you there.

9
00:04:58,447 --> 00:04:59,641
l'm sorry.

10
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:09,483
l'm Miss Traverse, headmistress.
Welcome to the Academy.

11
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,845
Heather is so excited to be here.

12
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:20,206
This is much nicer
than the boarding school l went to.

13
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,640
We're rather isolated here...

14
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:25,839
...so we try and supply the students
with plenty of stimulation.

15
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:28,561
Academic and otherwise.

16
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:31,998
Do you like athletics, Heather?
You look as though you might.

17
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,802
Oh, Heather needs to concentrate
on her studies...

18
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,401
...before she can worry about
playing games.

19
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,120
This way, please.

20
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:44,676
lt's been over a century
since the Academy...

21
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,759
...was originally founded
as a one-room schoolhouse.

22
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,716
We've grown quite nicely since then.

23
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:54,522
ln fact, all of the teachers
were once students at the school.

24
00:05:56,127 --> 00:06:01,121
Miss Leland,
this is Dr. and Mrs. Fasulo.

25
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,841
You must be Heather.

26
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,523
Heather, would you like to join me?

27
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:11,323
We like to have a short interview
with each new student as she arrives.

28
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,246
Just so we know what sort of
young lady we're dealing with.

29
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,601
Miss Leland will sit down with you
to discuss tuition.

30
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,877
Follow me, Heather.

31
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,561
So you enjoy setting fires.

32
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,639
According to my papers,
the whole house almost went up...

33
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:55,601
...as a result of some sort of
disagreement with your mother.

34
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,721
This is not a school
for wayward girls, Heather.

35
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,838
This is not a juvenile hall.

36
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:06,276
We have a great tradition of graduating
only the finest young ladies.

37
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:10,086
So no fires?

38
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:17,166
Your mother has inquired
about financial aid.

39
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,318
Apparently, your father is not as well off
as he presents himself.

40
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:26,445
We do offer scholarships for students
we consider particularly gifted.

41
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,717
Has anyone ever thought
you might be?

42
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:40,357
Complete this within the time limit,
and we'll go from there.

43
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:28,838
So how did we do?

44
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,883
Don't let your nails
get out of control.

45
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,918
Miss Mackinaw?

46
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,360
Take care of this young lady,
won't you?

47
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,957
Are you hungry?

48
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:59,076
You must drink your milk, girls.

49
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:00,646
Where's Ann Whales been?

50
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,322
You didn't hear? lt was really bloody.

51
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,163
You'll have to pull your socks up.

52
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:24,123
Otherwise, it's a uniform demerit.

53
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,238
And then what? A spanking?

54
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,243
l'm Marcy Turner.

55
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,085
Heather.

56
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,398
You take the scholarship test?

57
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:52,321
Apparently, my father isn't as well off
as he presents himself.

58
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:54,885
Who is?

59
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:58,725
Hi, Marcy.
How are you?

60
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:04,964
-l'm well.
-Wow, that's super.

61
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:08,526
Have you all met Heather?

62
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,046
Hi there.

63
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,516
So you're Marcy's new friend?

64
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,036
Sure.

65
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:17,926
That's super keen.

66
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,004
Hey<i>....</i>

67
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:21,882
Samantha.

68
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:25,162
-Samantha.
-Yes, Heather?

69
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:29,121
Do me a favor: Point those torpedoes
south and start walking.

70
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,726
l'm trying to eat.

71
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,046
A bad girl.

72
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, is your pubic hair red, too?

73
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,483
Guess there's only one way
to find out:

74
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:45,043
Marcy,
does Heather have red pubes?

75
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,397
ls she a fire-crotch?

76
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:53,240
l'm kidding. Friends?

77
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,725
Oops.

78
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:59,246
Sorry about that.

79
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,561
-Good night, ladies.
-Good night, Miss Mackinaw.

80
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,923
Good night, Miss Mackinaw.

81
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,486
Good night, Miss Mackinaw.

82
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:46,478
Good night, everyone.

83
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,282
Good night, Mary.

84
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,957
Good night, Lena.

85
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:06,046
<i>Heather.</i>

86
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:23,522
<i>Free us.</i>

87
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:27,767
<i>Release us.</i>

88
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,959
This is my bed.

89
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,122
lt's a nice bed.

90
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,398
Someone else
will have to sleep here.

91
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,561
Why are there twigs in my hair?

92
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:34,082
What?

93
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,405
-Hey, wait up.
-Okay, well hurry up...

94
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,319
-...we can't be late again.
-All right.

95
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:39,522
Hey, whose bed is that?

96
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:49,117
Ann Whales.
She's in the hospital now.

97
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,360
She had an accident.

98
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,726
What happened?

99
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:57,442
Tried to kill herself in chemistry class.
Couple weeks ago.

100
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:00,115
There was blood all over the place.

101
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,202
Let's go, ladies.

102
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,759
Have a good day.

103
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,559
Say it.

104
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,441
Say it.

105
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,164
'' l'm a fire-crotch.''

106
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:25,282
-What?
-'' l am a fire-crotch.''

107
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,358
How many football players
put it in you...

108
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:31,281
...before your mom got sick of having
another tramp around the house?

109
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,240
Nice one.

110
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:38,520
lf you know what's good for you, you'll
run away and never, ever come back.

111
00:16:38,727 --> 00:16:41,685
Got it, fire-crotch?

112
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:55,519
Miss Fasulo,
you are 20 minutes late.

113
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:56,955
Sorry.

114
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:00,763
You are disrupting
the other students' ability to learn.

115
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:05,005
-Sorry.
-More than three minutes tardy...

116
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,516
...equals a truancy.

117
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,356
Go to Miss Traverse's office
and inform her of your infraction.

118
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:15,082
-Come on.
-Don't you dare talk back to me!

119
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,800
You get out of my sight!

120
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,916
Get out of my class immediately!

121
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:23,087
And that's a demerit
for your un-tucked blouse.

122
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,363
Do not go to the headmistress' office
without tucking in your--

123
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,722
Don't tuck it in here!

124
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:34,842
What kind of a low-class so-and-so
reaches her hands into<i>....</i>

125
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:39,006
Go to the ladies' room,
and then go to Miss Traverse's office.

126
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:53,196
<i>I was hoping you'd be here more than a</i>
<i>few days before being sent to see me.</i>

127
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,801
l'm disappointed, Heather.

128
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,639
You know, you're right.

129
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:06,362
l'm just not up to the standards
of this fine institution.

130
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,966
Better let me call my parents.
Tell them to come get me.

131
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,606
Here.

132
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,878
-<i>Yes?</i>
-Mom?

133
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,596
<i>Heather, I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>to hear from you.</i>

134
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,037
<i>It's just wonderful about the</i>
<i>scholarship, dear.</i>

135
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,044
<i>I told all the other ladies.</i>

136
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,637
No, Mom. l-- l faked it. lt was--

137
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,439
Look, can l just talk to Dad?

138
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,996
<i>Your father is entertaining</i>
<i>company, dear.</i>

139
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:52,765
-Listen to me--
<i>-Mrs. Richards...</i>

140
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,918
<i>... will you mind the carpet.</i>
<i>It's brand new.</i>

141
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,203
l'm sorry that l got into trouble
all the time.

142
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,005
<i>Oh, hi, Dorothy.</i>

143
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,437
And that l fought with you.

144
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,840
-And the fire.
<i>-I had to pull a lot of strings...</i>

145
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:08,760
<i>-... to get you into that school.</i>
-Mom, l...

146
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,635
...l promise that l won't embarrass you
anymore, okay?

147
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,565
<i>You think I sent you....</i>

148
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:18,966
<i>Heather, I am your mother.</i>

149
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,365
<i>Oh, for heaven's sak e. I have to go.</i>
<i>Mrs. Richards just spilled that drink.</i>

150
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,081
Mom, l just wanna come home.

151
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,279
l miss my friends.

152
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,637
<i>Heather, sweetheart...</i>

153
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,315
<i>...you don't have any friends.</i>

154
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,602
<i>You stop being such a weakling...</i>

155
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:41,800
<i>...and you work hard</i>
<i>and you mak e me proud.</i>

156
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:54,007
l'll excuse the truancy.

157
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,957
You may return to class.

158
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,195
You shouldn't go into the woods.

159
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:38,884
lt's not safe.

160
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,482
lt's not so bad here.

161
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,676
Better than living at home.

162
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,804
Home would be fine
if my mom was dead.

163
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,483
You shouldn't say things like that.

164
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,325
Here.

165
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:10,279
We can listen together...

166
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:12,239
...if you want.

167
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,883
<i>You first heard her</i>
<i>at the ripe age of 1 7...</i>

168
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,966
<i>... with her number-one hit</i>
<i>''It's My Party, '' here's Lesley Gore.</i>

169
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,526
-Marcy.
-Jeez.

170
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,485
-Marcy looked like she was gonna cry.
-Sorry.

171
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,001
-Come on, Samantha. We're ready.
-Ready?

172
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,767
-Here!
-Barbecue, it's you!

173
00:24:56,967 --> 00:25:00,846
-Come on, Heather.
-Shut up, Jen. lt's okay, Heather.

174
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:06,278
-Come on, Heather. Heather.
-Come on, Heather, get the ball, Heather.

175
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,762
Quit standing around
and bring back the ball.

176
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,719
-What are you doing?
-Bring the ball!

177
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,485
<i>Set us free.</i>

178
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:21,761
<i>Help us.</i>

179
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,837
Has anyone heard what's happened
to Ann Whales?

180
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,719
l haven't heard anything.

181
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:28,679
ls she still in the hospital?

182
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:32,721
You know, Marcy, you could be sitting
on a dead girl's bed.

183
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:34,645
Ann's not dead.

184
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:37,924
-Well, how do you know, Marcy?
-She probably killed her.

185
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:40,840
-Yeah, and you're next.
-Shut up, fire-crotch.

186
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,043
Can we get back
to the photosynthesis?

187
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:46,119
-Maybe it was Clara Thompson.
-Oh, God.

188
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,399
-Who's this?
-A stupid story they tell all the freshmen.

189
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:52,440
Don't go into the woods at night
or blah, blah, blah.

190
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:55,081
The story goes all the way back
to the old days.

191
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,677
-Tracy peed her pants when she heard it.
-Oh, shut up.

192
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,886
Clara Thompson and her sisters
were these three witches...

193
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:04,686
...that took over this school
almost 1 00 years ago.

194
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,287
<i>They just walk ed</i>
<i>out of the woods one day.</i>

195
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:13,036
<i>No one knew where they came from.</i>

196
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,403
l heard they were orphans.

197
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,127
l thought they just kind of
came out of nowhere.

198
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:24,242
<i>Anyways, after they arrived</i>
<i>at the school...</i>

199
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,881
<i>-...strange things started to happen.</i>
<i>-We love you.</i>

200
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,601
<i>The sisters were just creepy.</i>

201
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:31,843
<i>They were always</i>
<i>looking off to the trees.</i>

202
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:35,599
<i>Hearing v oices</i>
<i>that no one else could hear.</i>

203
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:43,684
<i>One day, the students caught them</i>
<i>practicing a weird ritual.</i>

204
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:45,843
-<i>Right inside the school.</i>
-Witch.

205
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,397
They were terrified
by what they saw.

206
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,925
<i>They taunted the sisters.</i>

207
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:54,758
<i>They beat them.</i>

208
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:59,197
<i>I mean, it got really bad.</i>

209
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:02,444
<i>So, Clara called upon the woods</i>
<i>for revenge.</i>

210
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:07,840
<i>She offered them all the students'</i>
<i>souls in return.</i>

211
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,885
We'll do anything!

212
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:15,436
A couple of days later, the girls
chased the sisters into the forest.

213
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:17,480
Out for blood.

214
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:21,604
<i>But when they all got out there,</i>
<i>something happened.</i>

215
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,081
<i>Something bad.</i>

216
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:25,886
-What?
-No one knows.

217
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,719
<i>Accept these gifts...</i>

218
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:32,045
<i>...and let the primal song</i>
<i>free your restless souls.</i>

219
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:37,842
<i>But what we do know,</i>
<i>is that later that night...</i>

220
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:42,438
<i>...all the other girls came out of the</i>
<i>woods, led by Clara.</i>

221
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:44,160
<i>Lik e she had them under a spell.</i>

222
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,079
<i>Lik e they were possessed.</i>

223
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:51,842
<i>And they all watched</i>
<i>as Clara chopped up the headmistress...</i>

224
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,036
...with an axe.

225
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:59,760
<i>I am so proud of you, Clara.</i>

226
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:07,157
Yeah, and then
all the other girls joined in...

227
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:12,282
...and they stabbed her
and smashed her head in with logs.

228
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:15,763
And when she was in this big,
mushy pile...

229
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:18,686
...of guts and bones and blood...

230
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:24,841
...they dumped it all down the well.
The very same one out in the rec yard.

231
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,198
And what l hear...

232
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:30,604
...is that Clara still roams
the woods at night...

233
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:35,756
...waiting for little girls
to wander too far out.

234
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,276
Waiting for fresh blood.

235
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:42,283
Yeah, real mature, Jen.

236
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,325
What do you think, Heather?

237
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,121
l heard you took a walk
in the woods not long ago.

238
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,158
You see any Clara Thompsons
out there?

239
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,122
You ever been out there, Barb?

240
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,085
Quit it, we haven't started yet.

241
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:15,756
Quit it!

242
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,524
l'm going.

243
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,846
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

244
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,436
-Go.
-l am!

245
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,600
This is so s--

246
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:42,355
<i>Trust us.</i>

247
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,362
How are you today?

248
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,684
-l don't have my pencils and stuff.
-You won't need them.

249
00:30:49,887 --> 00:30:53,163
This is the first
of your advanced courses.

250
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:55,164
lt's a condition
of your scholarship...

251
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,285
...to participate in this class
whenever told.

252
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,240
Heather...

253
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:04,483
...how did you come
to attend this school?

254
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:09,483
Well, l got into the car and then
my dad started the engine<i>....</i>

255
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,239
l won't ask again.

256
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:17,120
A woman came to my school
during conferences this summer...

257
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,836
...and convinced my mother
that this is where l should be going.

258
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:23,840
-And?
-And...

259
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,043
...my mom wanted me
out of the house.

260
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:29,842
Do you resent your mother
for leaving you here?

261
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:34,166
Sure.

262
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,244
You hate her?

263
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:40,084
-No.
-Does she hate you?

264
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,439
A loving mother never
abandons her child.

265
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,960
To be separated from her
is like an amputation.

266
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:58,678
lt doesn't matter what a child looks
like, if she's smart, if she's stupid...

267
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,481
...if she has no friends.

268
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:04,960
So why would your
mother leave you here?

269
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:13,518
That is none of your business.

270
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,006
She's afraid of you.

271
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:17,960
-Stop!
-Why is she afraid of you?

272
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:19,924
<i>Kill her.</i>

273
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,840
Are you a bad person?
Do you think bad thoughts?

274
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:25,841
-Stop!
-ls it the voices?

275
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,999
<i>Pain.</i>

276
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:35,202
-l don't--
<i>-Destiny.</i>

277
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,998
l don't<i>....</i>

278
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:40,797
What do they say?

279
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,798
<i>Heather.</i>

280
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:45,003
Heather, do you hear?

281
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:49,638
<i>Kill your mother.</i>

282
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:52,239
<i>Teacher. Death.</i>

283
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,967
<i>Serve us.</i>

284
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:57,521
<i>We love you.</i>

285
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,644
<i>Kill her.</i>

286
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:11,402
-What the hell was that?
-Watch your language.

287
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,278
lf l frightened you...

288
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,399
...l apologize.

289
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,045
How did you do in there?

290
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:28,837
Are you special enough
for a scholarship?

291
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:33,000
Everyone knows you're a fake.

292
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,284
You're not an egghead
like Marcy and Ann.

293
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:39,644
You're dumber than
a fucking tree stump.

294
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,326
l believe you're gonna cry, fire-crotch.

295
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:45,557
Heard you scream all
the way down the hall.

296
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:48,960
Traverse give you
a hard time in there?

297
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:53,918
Seriously.

298
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:56,358
You look like you've seen a ghost.

299
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:59,443
Or heard one.

300
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:05,046
Not so tough anymore, are we?

301
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:07,605
Samantha.

302
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,436
<i>All right, ladies.</i>

303
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:39,126
The Austrian War of Liberation.

304
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,561
Today's lesson.

305
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:47,396
ln April 1 809, Austria proclaimed
war of liberation on France.

306
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:52,243
France responded by
rapidly advancing<i>....</i>

307
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,762
Which, if you remember,
we occupied<i>....</i>

308
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:59,685
The Germans<i>....</i>

309
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:02,316
<i>Balance.</i>

310
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,326
Drink your milk.

311
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,364
What is it?

312
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,885
You'd think her parents
would take her home.

313
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:40,966
Can't.

314
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,239
They died.

315
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:51,078
Marcy...

316
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:55,843
...have you heard...

317
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:03,365
...or seen strange things
happen at this school?

318
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,125
Like what?

319
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:10,925
Heard you been saying stuff
behind my back, fire-crotch.

320
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,965
Now, Samantha, all l said
was your breath smells like...

321
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:18,676
...you've been drinking out of
Miss Mackinaw's douche bag, that's all.

322
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:25,439
l don't wanna kiss you, Samantha,
so please, don't ask.

323
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:28,246
Now, you listen
very closely, fire-crotch:

324
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:30,796
We have a certain way
of doing things around here...

325
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,162
...and you better figure out
what that way is...

326
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:35,557
...or there are going to be
serious consequences.

327
00:37:57,407 --> 00:38:03,198
Fire-crotch! Fire-crotch! Fire-crotch!

328
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,285
Get off me!

329
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,324
Get away from me.

330
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,360
Why don't you let her go?

331
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,206
-What is this?
-Miss Fasulo attacked Miss Wise...

332
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,039
...in the dining hall.

333
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:51,599
-ls that so?
-l didn't attack anyone.

334
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:53,758
l was just trying to defend myself.

335
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:06,396
l'm sorry. l didn't mean to<i>....</i>

336
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:17,037
Now, listen: We have a certain way
of doing things around here...

337
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:19,676
...and you had better figure
out what that way is...

338
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:23,237
...or there are going to be
serious consequences.

339
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:26,919
Get to the bunkhouse
before lights out.

340
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:20,526
Ann?

341
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,437
That's your name, isn't it?

342
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:30,480
l'm Heather.

343
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:35,402
l know what you're here for.

344
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:40,320
-You're special too.
-What?

345
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:44,480
Like me. Like Marcy.

346
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:48,283
We have to do what they say
or they'll kill everyone.

347
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:50,119
l can't understand you.

348
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,956
l am so cold.

349
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:47,044
lt's too late. They're here for me.

350
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:10,801
What are you doing out of
your bunk, young lady?

351
00:42:12,647 --> 00:42:15,764
Ann, what are you doing awake?

352
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,679
You lie down right now
and go to sleep.

353
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,477
Sit down and wait for the nurse.

354
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,836
What was that all about?

355
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,310
What happened last night?

356
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,038
No, later.

357
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,475
Just go ahead, l'll catch up.

358
00:43:09,647 --> 00:43:12,480
So we had a little
accident last night?

359
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:16,076
Twisted your ankle?

360
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,832
Hey, Ann.

361
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,912
lt's breakfast.

362
00:43:25,447 --> 00:43:26,766
l know.

363
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:28,838
What happened to you?

364
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,554
No doubt you have all heard
that one of our family...

365
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,443
Banged up my ankle.

366
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:37,006
Sorry about all the hollering last night.

367
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,870
...Ann Whales...

368
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,316
...went missing sometime last night.

369
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:39,919
Last night?

370
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:41,600
When?

371
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:42,836
Breakfast.

372
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,313
l just wanted to reassure all of you:

373
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:45,877
Nuts, we should go.

374
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,829
The authorities are searching for her
as we speak.

375
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,639
ln the meantime...

376
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,519
...the best way to deal with this
is go on with our work...

377
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,229
...and trust that all will
be resolved in time.

378
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,394
Dismissed.

379
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,794
That's all that's left of Ann.

380
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,591
Wake up, Miss Turner.
lt's time for your lesson.

381
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,550
For your throat.

382
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,188
The song must be perfect.

383
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,911
You must do it over and over
until there are no mistakes.

384
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,389
My guidance will assure that.

385
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,712
All right, now, Miss Turner,
we're going to try it again.

386
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,440
-And this time--
-Please, l've been doing this all day--

387
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,670
lt is tremendously
important that we do this.

388
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,196
-l am trying. l can't do it--
-l wouldn't want to have to--

389
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,874
You put your makeup on
upside down, silly.

390
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,759
Your girlfriend's got a real
pretty voice, fire-crotch.

391
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,234
Back off.

392
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,994
We need to have a little discussion.

393
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,112
Try it again!

394
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,594
The folks at the hospital
gave me this.

395
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,269
l guess Ann must have forgot it
after her accident.

396
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,270
Ann will appreciate this.
l'll give it to her this evening.

397
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,512
How is she?

398
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,078
Quiet, but we're keeping
an eye on her.

399
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,471
l don't suspect she'll
try anything rash again.

400
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,273
Good.

401
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,718
Well, thanks for signing this stuff.

402
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,599
l'll be sure to get it to Ann's
insurance company this week.

403
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,478
lt's no problem at all.

404
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,198
Okay.

405
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,639
Marcy, listen to me:

406
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,631
l just saw a cop
talking to Miss Traverse.

407
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,475
And she didn't tell them anything
about Ann. She totally lied.

408
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,076
l had a really tough session
today. My throat's sore.

409
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,195
Hey. Marcy.

410
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,237
There's no one out
there looking for Ann.

411
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,596
Ann's fine.

412
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,716
Everything's fine.

413
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,992
Hey, l really need to talk to you.

414
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,434
Leave me alone...

415
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,158
...fire-crotch.

416
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,714
Don't forget to drink your milk.

417
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,757
She's crazy.

418
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,276
-Fire-crotch.
-l hope she gets kicked out.

419
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,473
-This girl is nothing but trouble.
-l told you they were gay.

420
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,795
She's in trouble now.

421
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,796
She is so lucky.
She better watch out.

422
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,030
She'll get her later.

423
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,832
Lights out.

424
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,432
Everyone in bed. Now.

425
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,431
<i>Sleep.</i>

426
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,071
<i>Want Marcy.</i>

427
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,829
<i>Release us, Heather.</i>

428
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,111
l was asleep.

429
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,231
You were asleep?

430
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,911
Everybody was asleep?

431
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,832
You didn't see anything, either.

432
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,797
Breakfast.

433
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,234
Why is everyone standing around?

434
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,112
Good Lord.

435
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,800
Everyone, get ready for breakfast.

436
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,953
l'll inform Miss Traverse
of what's happened.

437
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,718
Get dressed, Miss Fasulo.

438
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,515
Don't worry. We'll find Marcy.

439
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,792
And Ann?

440
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,839
ln the process of metamorphosis,
there are four stages.

441
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,594
Could you tell me another
word for chrysalis?

442
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,034
-Pupa.
-Correct.

443
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,638
Marcy?

444
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,589
-Marcy?
-You're not gonna find her out there.

445
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,072
-Get away from me. Get--
-Shut up and just listen to me.

446
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,800
-Get off of me.
-l'm trying to help you.

447
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,029
l have to get Marcy.

448
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,351
l tried to warn you about Marcy,
but they're always watching.

449
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,078
We've gotta get you out of here.

450
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,835
l called your dad.
l told him you went nuts.

451
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,431
l just hope he gets here
before they take you too.

452
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,997
lt's the teachers.

453
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,912
They do tests.

454
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,389
Give out scholarships.

455
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,391
Clara Thompson
was just the beginning.

456
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,915
The woods possessed her.
Took over the school.

457
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,435
And there's more of them
waiting to be freed.

458
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,398
You think you're the only
one that hears the voices?

459
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,394
How do you think they found you?
The woods need more bodies.

460
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,677
They'll take every girl here,
and you're the key, Heather.

461
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,831
Just like Clara was.

462
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,920
You're the first
Miss Traverse has seen.

463
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,591
You're psycho.

464
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,992
Listen.

465
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,311
Very closely.

466
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,953
-We've got to find--
-Samantha.

467
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,668
You should be in class right now.

468
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,873
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,871
Come with me.

470
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,393
l believe you're tardy for
Miss Charevoix's class, Miss Fasulo.

471
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,149
Don't drink the milk.

472
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,437
<i>Marcy.</i>

473
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,752
<i>Right now.</i>

474
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,559
So Hannibal began his
trek across the Alps.

475
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,076
Who can tell me his
mode of transportation?

476
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,955
Miss Fasulo?

477
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,992
l'll give you a hint:

478
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,870
lt wasn't horses.

479
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,879
He needed a lot of peanuts.

480
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,077
What was that?

481
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,395
Come on, let's go. Hurry. Go.

482
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,312
-Just follow her.
-Oh, what's going on?

483
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,436
-Where are we going?
-l don't know.

484
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,388
Come on. Everyone out.

485
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,189
Come on.

486
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,036
l'm gonna miss you.

487
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,271
This is so horrible.

488
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,555
-What did you say to Samantha?
-Nothing.

489
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,871
The girl is dead. What did you say?

490
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,310
l know what you're doing.

491
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,877
-She told me everything.
-Told you what?

492
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,355
Which story?
That l kidnapped your friends--?

493
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,919
Yes.

494
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,029
Samantha was a good student, once.

495
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,077
But she was very angry
and very confused.

496
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,230
But l was charged
with looking after her.

497
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,800
Obviously, l failed to do that.

498
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,871
Where are Ann and Marcy?

499
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,591
They ran away.

500
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,354
lt happens.

501
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,950
You don't have to believe me.

502
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,197
This is one of the most distinguished
schools in the country.

503
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,029
We could not very well survive,
had we orchestrated the disappearance...

504
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,111
...of two of our best students...

505
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,111
...within weeks of each other.

506
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,793
Truth be told:

507
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,474
We may not survive
this, regardless.

508
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,432
l don't know what l'd do
if l lost this school.

509
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,194
lt's been a part of me for so long.

510
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,115
Be patient. Your friends
will come back. They always do.

511
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,553
ls there something else
you wish to ask?

512
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,515
The things that l've heard.

513
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,791
The things that l've seen.

514
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,428
-l'm not crazy.
-l know.

515
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,431
You're different.

516
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,878
All the signs are there, Heather.

517
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,149
You want me to call the parents?

518
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,198
l should be the one to tell them.

519
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,029
Robert, have you met
Heather Fasulo?

520
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,834
How are you?

521
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,037
Hey, how's the search for
Ann and Marcy going?

522
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,674
l just miss them so much.

523
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,192
Miss Fasulo is expected in chapel.

524
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,317
Two of the students...

525
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,314
...did, in fact, go missing
shortly after we found Samantha.

526
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,472
-Ann was one of them.
-And you weren't gonna tell me?

527
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,631
l didn't wanna cause you
any more trouble.

528
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,192
Well, that's really not up to you,
Miss Traverse.

529
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,518
One of the students saw them
run into the forest.

530
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,911
Miss Leland will show
you which direction.

531
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,317
Ann? Marcy?

532
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,277
Hello?

533
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,796
'' Miss Leland will show you
which direction.''

534
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,759
Come on, it's beyond your curfew.

535
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,316
Come on, girls.

536
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,872
Lucky rabbit, lucky rabbit. Okay.

537
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,233
Marcy?

538
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,152
Ann?

539
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,709
Samantha?

540
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,599
<i>Are you special enough</i>
<i>for a scholarship?</i>

541
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,672
<i>You tak e the scholarship test?</i>

542
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,435
<i>We do offer scholarships for students</i>
<i>we consider particularly gifted.</i>

543
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,358
<i>Blood.</i>

544
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,518
Ann?

545
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,231
Marcy?

546
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,671
-Dr. Fasulo--
-l'm sorry to waste your time.

547
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,229
Whatever you were told,
the damage was not that bad.

548
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,960
Somebody called and said
my daughter went on a rampage.

549
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,599
l don't know who made that call.

550
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,274
But we've been very attentive
to your daughter's needs.

551
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,273
-She just needs to settle in.
-l'm sorry to waste your time.

552
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,793
But this is all my fault.

553
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,793
l never should have left her here
in the first place.

554
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,399
-Joe, turn around.
-l can't understand it.

555
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,710
Go back and ask for directions.
lt's too late.

556
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,110
l'm positive we went out
the same way we came in.

557
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,999
-This is ridiculous.
-l think l saw a road a ways back.

558
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,914
You be quiet. We wouldn't be out here
to begin with if it wasn't for you.

559
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,310
-Alice.
-l don't know what l have to do...

560
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,155
-...to get you under control, Heather.
-Then stop trying.

561
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,589
You keep up the smart mouth,
young lady.

562
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,433
As soon as we get home,
we are finding another school.

563
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,670
A religious one. l'm talking nuns.

564
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,832
-Oh, Alice, we're not even Catholic.
-l don't care.

565
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,799
Joe, watch where you're going!

566
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,118
Dad!

567
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:34,070
Great. This is my life.
Me and my perfect family.

568
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,071
Could we please just drop it?

569
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,629
Maybe you're the one
that needs to go back to school.

570
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,995
You can't even find your way
down a simple road.

571
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,435
Now, you listen.
l've had just about enough--

572
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,676
Heather. Heather, are you all right?

573
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,957
l can't understand it.
The earth must have just given out.

574
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,668
Joe, help me.

575
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,355
Heather, sweetheart. Hang in there.

576
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,513
-What?
-Hang in there?

577
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,396
You be quiet.

578
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,993
Alice?

579
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,274
Alice?

580
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,479
-Does that hurt?
-Yes.

581
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,035
She actually sustained that
before the accident.

582
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,429
l'll go see about some crutches.

583
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,277
The doctor thinks you have
a mild concussion, Heather.

584
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,396
No big deal.

585
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,159
Where's my parents?

586
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,119
Why don't l go tell Miss Traverse
you're awake?

587
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,999
Help me.

588
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,597
Where's Mom?

589
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,678
Come here, honey.

590
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,554
Where is she?

591
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,996
Oh, Heather.

592
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,480
-Here she is.
-Oh, you can't be in here.

593
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,991
-No!
-Just relax. Just-- lt'll be fine.

594
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,639
-Hey.
-Dad! No!

595
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,076
-What are you doing? Let go of her!
-Heather, it's gonna be all right.

596
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,516
-Bring her back!
-She's a witch!

597
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,595
Stop! What are you do--?
She'll kill you!

598
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,149
What are you doing?
Where are they taking her?

599
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,594
She's in shock.

600
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,193
-Stop.
-Good girl.

601
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,112
-Bring her back.
-Heather hasn't been fully examined.

602
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,710
She needs me
and she needs to be here with me.

603
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,678
The doctor says she may have
internal injuries.

604
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,993
We must give them a chance
to do their jobs.

605
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,030
l can't understand it.
l mean, one minute...

606
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,430
...we're sitting there
on the side of the road...

607
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,670
...and then the next minute
the car just<i>....</i>

608
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,313
Something took her.

609
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,311
ln the car, something<i>....</i>

610
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,794
Bring her back here.

611
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,638
Bring me my daughter.

612
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,435
l wanna see my mom! Where is she?

613
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,118
-No. No!
-l really can't bring Heather back to you.

614
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,430
-Please!
-Who the hell are you?

615
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,394
You do as l say, right--

616
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,033
l want my mom! Where is my mom?

617
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,918
Stop him! l wanna see my--

618
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,278
<i>Heather.</i>

619
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,629
<i>Wak e up. It's time.</i>

620
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,796
How are you feeling?

621
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,033
Dad?

622
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,073
Heather? Heather.

623
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,834
l'm afraid his condition
has worsened.

624
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,197
But the doctors say
it's only temporary.

625
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,470
<i>-Ceremony.</i>
<i>-Heather.</i>

626
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,870
<i>I love you.</i>

627
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,270
Balance the stones.

628
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,995
<i>All the signs are there.</i>

629
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,308
<i>It's time.</i>

630
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,238
<i>Our wait is over. Free us.</i>

631
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,718
<i>Free us.</i>

632
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,352
<i>Drink it.</i>

633
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,032
They moved you. You're over there.

634
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,919
<i>This is my bed.</i>

635
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,230
-Good night, ladies.
-Good night, Miss Traverse.

636
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,789
-Good night, Miss Traverse.
-Good night, Miss Mackinaw.

637
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,313
Good night, Miss Traverse.

638
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,152
<i>You better watch out.</i>

639
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,839
<i>Something's going to happen.</i>

640
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,958
<i>You better be careful.</i>

641
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:39,678
<i>My family is large.</i>
<i>I cannot rest until I've freed them all.</i>

642
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,914
What's happening?

643
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,958
<i>If you struggle, it will only hurt more.</i>

644
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,799
Where are we?

645
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,313
<i>You don't know what it's lik e</i>
<i>to be trapped.</i>

646
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,392
<i>To be tied to the same place...</i>

647
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,438
<i>... for hundreds of years.</i>

648
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,510
<i>They're here to help you, Heather.</i>
<i>Don't be sad.</i>

649
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,195
<i>By leaving this world...</i>

650
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,871
<i>...you're giving others the opportunity</i>
<i>to fully enter it.</i>

651
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,077
What's wrong with you? Let me go!

652
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,950
<i>Ever since I came here with my sisters,</i>
<i>we have been waiting for you.</i>

653
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,478
<i>Hear our prayer, Mother.</i>

654
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,755
Marcy, stop.

655
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,672
<i>Accept these gifts...</i>

656
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,799
<i>...and let the primal song</i>
<i>free your restless souls.</i>

657
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,918
<i>Balance the stones, Heather.</i>

658
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,878
-<i>And there shall be an end to the pain.</i>
-No.

659
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,954
Mom? Help me.

660
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,998
What do you think l've been trying
to do this whole time?

661
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,957
Now, you stop being such a weakling...

662
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,394
...and you work hard...

663
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,508
...and you make your mother proud.

664
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,076
l'm sorry.

665
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,509
Heather! Let me in!

666
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,558
<i>Balance the stones, Heather.</i>

667
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,519
You never listen.

668
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,318
Heather!

669
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,392
Open this door!

670
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,871
Heather!

671
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,910
Somebody let me in!

672
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,269
l'm so proud of you, Heather.

673
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,957
<i>Let the souls of the woods</i>
<i>enter these young vessels...</i>

674
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,509
<i>...and finally walk the earth.</i>

675
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,472
-Heather!
-Dad?

676
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,392
Heather, get out!

677
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,673
<i>You can't escape.</i>

678
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,350
<i>You can't stop the change.</i>

679
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,070
<i>Help me.</i>

680
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,390
-<i>Kill her.</i>
-<i>Kill her.</i>

681
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,437
<i>Kill her.</i>

682
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,312
So gifted.

683
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,190
<i>I am everywhere.</i>
