1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,491
This is the captain speaking.

2
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,071
We're just now passing the
Arctic Circle which means

3
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:23,369
we're in the Land of the
Midnight Sun.

4
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,551
Please, sit still.

5
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,494
-What about your suitcase?
-Probably on its way to Murmansk.

6
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,962
-What is it like in the winter?
-The opposite, completely dark.

7
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,031
Take it easy.

8
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,474
-The light was red.
-lt was green.

9
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:40,281
Yes, of course it was green.
My memory fails me.

10
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,915
ls everything all right?

11
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,451
-What about her clothes?
-She was naked.

12
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,419
-Nothing else?
-Just a necklace and two earrings.

13
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,360
-Where are they?
-They've been checked.

14
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,196
You'll have a preliminary
report tomorrow.

15
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,171
Where are they?

16
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,871
You came quickly.

17
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,116
What do you know
about the case?

18
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,852
She left a party in the middle
of the night, Saturday.

19
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,423
Found at the garbage dump
30 hours later. That's all.

20
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,320
Did she have a record?
Did you know her?

21
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,685
No...

22
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,965
But l saw her sometimes.

23
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,895
-Where?
-She lived in an apartment nearby.

24
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,273
Let's take a look.

25
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:49,373
We won't find anything, Tom.
He's even washed her hair.

26
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,352
Her hands and nails
were scrubbed too.

27
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,088
-Perfectionist.
-Even the best makes mistakes.

28
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,562
-How did you get here before us?
-Vacation... l have family here.

29
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,177
The police in Stockholm raided
an apartment building.

30
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,047
They stormed in fully armed.

31
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,647
He sat up in bed and shouted...
That's when they recognized him.

32
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,550
The chief inspector?

33
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:36,190
ln a very intimate conversation
with the main witness.

34
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,042
Take your time.

35
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,679
-When did they meet?
-9 months ago.

36
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,520
Right after she moved to town.
They were together all the time.

37
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,818
They had an argument that night.

38
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,856
-Does he have an alibi?
-Not for late that night.

39
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,899
-Where did she get money?
-Grants...

40
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,697
Her parents are dead.

41
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,612
Dolce & Gabbana!
At least 6000 kroners.

42
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,519
She didn't need this.

43
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,526
Maybe it was exactly
what she needed.

44
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,091
-What do you mean?
-Boosts your self-confidence.

45
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,228
You need that when you're 17.

46
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,639
At least l did.

47
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,509
Don't forget this.

48
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,225
We'll call a press conference when
we have something to tell you.

49
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,155
He might have followed her
from the party.

50
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,129
An argument lead to a fight.
He panicked.

51
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,693
This murder is no accident.

52
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,396
lt's been carried out
with too much knowledge.

53
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,034
You might be right about that...
What knowledge?

54
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,309
The way all clues
have been removed.

55
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,615
l'm glad you're here.
l'm told you are good.

56
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:50,119
When did you last see her...
Eilert?

57
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,492
-lt's in the report.
-Yes, but l want you to tell me.

58
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,663
-At the party.
-Can you move over a bit?

59
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,699
These rooms are too small.

60
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,039
-What did you do at the party?
-The usual.

61
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,542
Drinking... Dancing... Partying.

62
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,216
Your friends told us different.

63
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,322
-What did they say?
-What do you think?

64
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,888
l don't know.
They're not my friends.

65
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,420
-Oh... why not?
-Because they're lying.

66
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,360
-What?
-They're lying!

67
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,794
Why are they lying?

68
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,428
-Were you Tanja's boyfriend?
-Yes.

69
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,132
-Nice girl.
-Tanja left the party...

70
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,244
...at a quarter past two.
Did you follow her?

71
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,750
-No.
-When did you leave then?

72
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,045
l stayed on for a while,
and then l went home.

73
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,925
Did Tanja like other men
to look at her?

74
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,596
Listen... l don't understand
fuckin' Swedish.

75
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,333
Me neither.

76
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,933
You got jealous. You argued,
and she ran off to someone else.

77
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,472
Bullshit.

78
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,581
Her clothes...
Do you know how much they cost?

79
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,621
She couldn't afford them...
and neither could you.

80
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,052
She saw someone else.

81
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,296
He gave her gifts.

82
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,861
Maybe she needed his attention?

83
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,262
You weren't enough, Eilert.

84
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,267
-Who did she go to?
-l don't know.

85
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,947
Come on.
Let's get this over with.

86
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,916
She went to some guy.
l don't know who he is.

87
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,250
-How do you know?
-l just found out.

88
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,850
How do you know?

89
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,651
Coffee?

90
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,162
l'm so fed up with
reviving dead people.

91
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,832
-lt's what you make of it.
-No, it isn't.

92
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,974
You should've seen her clothes.
At least 60 dresses!

93
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,349
l once met a woman
with 50 pairs of shoes.

94
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,348
-What did she want them for?
-l have no idea.

95
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,150
Let's get this job
done quickly, Erik.

96
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,184
Oh... are we in a rush?

97
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,823
l applied for a job in Norway.
Not North Norway.

98
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,096
-l've been here before.
-l know.

99
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,465
-You do?
-Yes, you told me about it.

100
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,606
A post office robbery
in the spring of 1972.

101
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,911
Please don't knock on the counter.

102
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,642
-ClD.
-And...?

103
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,746
Engstrom and Vik.

104
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,655
l thought maybe
l'd done something wrong.

105
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,493
Talk to him about that.

106
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,397
You must see a lot of
weird things.

107
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,767
-Working for the police, l mean.
-We see a lot of pretty things too.

108
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,433
Don't flirt with me.

109
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,545
-l'm on duty.
-So are we.

110
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,419
When you've been a policeman
long enough, nothin's weird.

111
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,651
Your luggage arrived before you.

112
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,220
Good.

113
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,314
l've nearly been here before.

114
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,452
lt reminds me of a hotel
on the west cost

115
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,988
where we stay
when we visit my in-laws.

116
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,150
One morning we woke up
with a couple standing in our room.

117
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,724
l tried to get rid of them

118
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,127
but they insist that
it's their room.

119
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,665
Eva got really upset.

120
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,439
Yes. They insist
that it's their room...?

121
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:33,877
Room?

122
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,082
What interests did she have?
What dreams?

123
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,715
Who did she associate with?

124
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,585
Who did she want
to associate with?

125
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,486
Which teachers did she like
and dislike?

126
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:29,032
Which boys did she like?
Or maybe she didn't like?

127
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,568
Everything is equally important.

128
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,439
lt's absurd that Tanja is gone.

129
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,679
lt's hard to understand that
she won't be sitting here tomorrow.

130
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,814
Or next week...

131
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:57,386
Some of you like Tanja,
and some of you hated her

132
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,798
but none of you
will ever see her again...

133
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,203
Because she is dead... murdered.

134
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,704
What did she want?

135
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,280
-Who?
-Hagen.

136
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,645
What is it with you and Hagen?

137
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,148
Nothing.
The body of a 17 year old...

138
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,888
What did she want?

139
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,657
They've found Tanja's backpack.

140
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,596
-When did you find the bag?
-Two hours ago.

141
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:39,327
Outside an old shed near
the dump. Some kids found it.

142
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,664
-Why isn't Tom here?
-He's finished.

143
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,032
He's already checked it
for finger...

144
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,473
Where is he?

145
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,572
On his way to the shed.

146
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,279
Stop him.

147
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,086
Find out who she went
to the movies with.

148
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,364
Astrid, maybe the staff
remember something.

149
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,628
The Moment. Jon Holt...

150
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,904
''Pia falls in love with Thomas,

151
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,098
''but thinks he's hiding
something from her.

152
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,503
''A voice inside Pia's head
tells her

153
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,669
''how to get rid of the problem.''

154
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,177
Anyone here
read crime novels?

155
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,675
Yes.

156
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,419
Nobody goes near the shed.

157
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,593
lf the perpetrator thinks the
bag may reveal him,

158
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,025
he'll come and get it.

159
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,601
lt was the same school bag
the murdered Tanja Lorentzen

160
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:59,480
had with her when she left
the party on Sunday morning.

161
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,354
lt's not been found.
lf you see or find such a bag,

162
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,890
then please contact the police.

163
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,392
lt may contain clues which will
lead us to Tanja's killer.

164
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,677
Maybe he doesn't watch TV.

165
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,041
Oh, yes. There's nothing else
to do around here.

166
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,751
Am l upsetting you?

167
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,889
You probably hear
jokes like that all the time.

168
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,125
No.

169
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,183
He's here.

170
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,655
Wait till he picks up the bag,
then we follow him. Quietly.

171
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,733
Freeze! Police!

172
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,015
He went into the shed.

173
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:13,773
Let's get him.

174
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,423
You can't get anywhere now.
Please come out.

175
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,310
Zakariassen! Down to the sea,
and follow the waterline.

176
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,651
Erik, you take the hillside,

177
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,655
and when you reach the bay,
you go left.

178
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,298
Here... here... here...

179
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,482
-Which way did he go?
-There...

180
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,697
You said to the right...

181
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,738
You said to the right.

182
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,760
Then l found Zakariassen
laying between the stones and...

183
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:50,764
He pointed. l ran
in the direction he pointed.

184
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,703
Then l saw a figure
disappear behind a stone...

185
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:01,112
Then l slipped. l heard a shot,
and saw him running towards me.

186
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:09,117
First he shoots Vik, and then
he runs straight towards you.

187
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,619
What?

188
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,488
After he shot Vik...

189
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,586
Did the perpetrator run
straight towards you?

190
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,115
l suppose he didn't see me.
lt was foggy.

191
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,439
And then?

192
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,092
When he saw me,
he turned abruptly and ran back.

193
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,624
l ran after him
down towards the sea.

194
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,903
Then he turned again.

195
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,334
Shot at me - missed -
and ran further.

196
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:10,246
That's when l spotted Erik
and stopped to... help him.

197
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,183
Describe the man you saw.

198
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,357
lt's that fucking map's fault!

199
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,920
Every stone is marked on it,

200
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,229
but not the bunker
below the shed.

201
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,291
Yes, most unfortunate.

202
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,197
lf l'd known about that tunnel,
l'd had a man down there.

203
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,236
We should always be armed,
like you do in Sweden.

204
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,281
-When will the autopsy take place?
-Tomorrow.

205
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,181
The bullet's in his spine.

206
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,188
The bullet is no good
without the weapon.

207
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,725
Don't worry.
One of your detectives

208
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,627
will handle the Vik case.

209
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,753
We need a special permit
to be armed,

210
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,189
and there was no reason
in this case -

211
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,763
as we couldn't imagine...

212
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,366
We heard you were the first
to arrive at the crime scene.

213
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,832
What did you see?

214
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,799
lt was very foggy.

215
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,601
l was the first person
to reach the beach,

216
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,676
and found Vik lying there.

217
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,139
There was nothing l could do.

218
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,651
How does it feel to lose
a colleague like that?

219
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,683
Damn sad.

220
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,220
-Does it hurt?
-What?

221
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,488
You've been on the TV all night.

222
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,031
Did you work together
for a long time?

223
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,191
Just over a year.

224
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,997
-Weird.
-What?

225
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,833
He was standing there yesterday.

226
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,310
l wish l'd been nicer to him.

227
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:13,721
Don't worry. You could say
anything to him. He was...

228
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,160
Do you have masking tape?

229
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,138
-Masking tape?
-Masking tape.

230
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:54,627
-How does it feel?
-Well...

231
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,063
Like a horse kicked you?

232
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,574
l thought you came
to turn out the light.

233
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,145
Thanks.

234
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,720
-lt was irresponsible.
-What?

235
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,095
To send you after him.
lt was irresponsible.

236
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,493
The guy was armed.
How could we know?

237
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,270
Madman. Waving his arms
around before he shot.

238
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,972
-Did you see him shoot Vik?
-No, l didn't see anything.

239
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,733
lt can't be easy.
He was a nice chap.

240
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,307
Have they removed the bullet?

241
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,712
lt went straight through.
Just a flesh wound.

242
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,445
Good. We need you.

243
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:28,121
He knew it might be a trap.
That's why he was armed.

244
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,986
He's cold, calculating
and thinks

245
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,960
he's more intelligent
than the police.

246
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,698
His arrogance will lead him
to make a mistake.

247
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,395
Tanja's bag contains something
that may convict the killer,

248
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,062
or at least the killer thinks so.

249
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,003
We have to check its contents
more thoroughly.

250
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:50,144
We have to confront Tanja's
classmates with its contents

251
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,511
and knock on all doors

252
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,651
between the house of the party
and the crime scene.

253
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,350
Tom... your preliminary
conclusion.

254
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,565
Tanja Lorentzen died
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

255
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,025
We assume that she didn't
die instantly.

256
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,769
No sexual assaults.
No sperm.

257
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,000
Nothing.

258
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,713
He worked with Erik
for a long time.

259
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,281
l'll be handling the Vik case.

260
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,684
Good.

261
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,945
-We'll just have to do our best.
-Of course.

262
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,161
We shall remember Erik Vik

263
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,463
as a sociable
and proud policeman

264
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,231
with one minute's silence.

265
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,830
Something wrong?

266
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,068
He was lying on his stomach.
Not on his back.

267
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,548
-Was this where you found Vik?
-Yes.

268
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,280
Okay. Mark the spot
and take a photo.

269
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,798
We found this next to
where Zakariassen was.

270
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,576
Good. Make sure Tom
runs a match with the bullet.

271
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:13,686
Reminds me of a hotel
where we stay

272
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:16,486
when we visit my in-laws...

273
00:35:18,095 --> 00:35:21,360
Then one morning we woke up,
and there's a couple...

274
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:07,174
-Do you have something to drink?
-Something strong?

275
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:09,246
Cognac?

276
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:13,040
Watch the reception desk.

277
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,835
-Do you like whiskey?
-Yes, sure.

278
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,816
-Cheers!
-l'm not allowed to do this.

279
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,324
Talk to strange men
in the middle of the night?

280
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:58,689
No.
We have to drink in silence...

281
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:08,529
How about you?

282
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:13,470
Don't you ever ask
anybody for permission?

283
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:16,736
Not to drink with you.

284
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,008
Don't you have a family?

285
00:37:23,287 --> 00:37:24,254
No.

286
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:26,480
That's a pity...

287
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:30,926
lt's nice to be alone too.

288
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,636
Do you have any sisters
or brothers?

289
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:41,699
No...

290
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,843
l once had a brother,
but he died when l was 11.

291
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,881
l don't know anybody
who has a dead brother.

292
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:06,824
lt's not that strange.
l thought it was embarrassing.

293
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:13,636
When l came to school,
the others didn't know anything.

294
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:17,398
l didn't say anything.

295
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,777
But they must have
asked for him?

296
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:25,479
Yes, but l invented stories
about where he was

297
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:29,946
and what had happened to him.

298
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,127
As time went by the stories
got more and more unlikely...

299
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,389
l'd better go upstairs.

300
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:48,762
Your colleague was here
looking for you.

301
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,104
-Who?
-He didn't introduce himself.

302
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,476
-What did he look like?
-A bit older than you.

303
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,143
A bit rough...

304
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,458
l never remember how people look.
Just the impression they make.

305
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:13,290
-What impression did he make?
-A bit nervous.

306
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,827
Smiled all the time.

307
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,366
Did he leave a message?

308
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,772
He'd seen something.
He wanted to talk to you...

309
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:30,636
-ls it important?
-No, l don't think so.

310
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:36,150
Aren't you going to
finish your whiskey?

311
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:39,948
Another time.

312
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:01,017
Froya?

313
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:06,815
-You're Froya Selmer.
-You're the cop.

314
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,130
l have to talk to you.
Can you come over here?

315
00:40:15,368 --> 00:40:17,097
You might've looked better
in a uniform.

316
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,570
-You went to that party.
-l was wasted.

317
00:40:25,345 --> 00:40:27,279
Too wasted to remember
what happened?

318
00:40:27,414 --> 00:40:29,678
Nothing happened.
That's why l got wasted.

319
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:33,582
-Was Tanja just as ''loaded''?
-''Loaded''?

320
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:34,717
Drunk.

321
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:37,184
Nobody understood
anything you said.

322
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:38,789
Pardon?

323
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,860
-ln the classroom.
-But you understood?

324
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:49,067
lt's not the first time
l've met a Swede.

325
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:54,131
Was it Tanja's boyfriend
you spoke to?

326
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:55,935
Why did you ask
when you knew the answer?

327
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:04,211
-Will you come for a ride?
-A ride with you?

328
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,645
Don't you want to?

329
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:23,293
-May l smoke?
-No.

330
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:27,665
Show me something cool!

331
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:31,970
''Something cool''?

332
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:35,071
Something cool.

333
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:40,676
l don't know what's
cool any more.

334
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:03,266
Let me out!

335
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:09,903
Here you go...

336
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,147
Maybe you'd like me
to accompany you?

337
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:33,024
-l think you know.
-Know what?

338
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:36,993
Where Tanja got
all her nice clothes.

339
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,997
How should l know?

340
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:41,467
Did she have a better friend
than you?

341
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:49,546
Here, you see...

342
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:53,215
This is where they found her...
in a garbage bag.

343
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:06,529
Tanja had a relationship with
an older man. Older than me.

344
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,793
He paid for
her expensive clothes.

345
00:44:10,336 --> 00:44:11,997
You told Eilert about him.

346
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,740
He would've found out anyway.

347
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:20,476
But you told him...
at that party.

348
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:29,112
She didn't have to go...
lt was her own fault.

349
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,824
What's his name?
The man she was with?

350
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:38,996
l never spoke to him.

351
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:46,236
She was really weird about it.
Like it was something special...

352
00:44:47,173 --> 00:44:48,800
having an affair with him.

353
00:44:49,776 --> 00:44:53,234
-Who?
-An old pig.

354
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,611
Where did they meet?

355
00:45:02,255 --> 00:45:03,722
She wrote him a letter.

356
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:11,320
She had read one of his books.
Was completely hooked.

357
00:45:12,432 --> 00:45:15,799
What's his name?
The author.

358
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:18,197
Jon Holt.

359
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,403
That wasn't hard- was it?

360
00:45:28,314 --> 00:45:29,838
l'll take you home now.

361
00:48:23,122 --> 00:48:24,646
Yes... Engstrom.

362
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:26,820
l don't want any more visits.

363
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:31,186
Jon Holt... We have to meet.

364
00:48:31,464 --> 00:48:35,400
No, not the two of us together.

365
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:37,763
l suppose you understand?

366
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,562
Why not?

367
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:42,098
Keep the police away from me,

368
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:45,171
and you'll sleep much better.

369
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:13,572
There are two pages
missing from the book.

370
00:49:13,906 --> 00:49:17,535
-They've been torn out.
-What was written on those pages?

371
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:20,138
l went to Tanja's apartment
to check.

372
00:49:20,746 --> 00:49:21,542
Did you find the pages?

373
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:23,842
l found another copy
of the same book.

374
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:29,888
-Must be a damn good book then?
-What was written on the pages?

375
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:34,090
A description of two young people
infatuated with one another.

376
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:39,393
So Tanja buys a new book because
two pages are missing.

377
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:41,862
No. The other book was signed

378
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:46,461
''To Tanja''
with Holt's own signature.

379
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:51,801
Well done, Arne.

380
00:49:56,248 --> 00:49:58,512
We'll have to ask the author

381
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:02,848
if he remembers her.

382
00:50:03,155 --> 00:50:05,055
Engstrom...
l need a word.

383
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:07,151
Yes, of course.

384
00:50:30,616 --> 00:50:33,016
-Did Vik have any problems?
-Problems?

385
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:38,251
l just heard his memory
failed him.

386
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:44,124
No, he was
a very competent policeman.

387
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:49,264
l can't understand your
explanation at the reconstruction.

388
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:55,132
You said you were here
when the perpetrator shot at you.

389
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:57,300
Yes, exactly.

390
00:50:58,544 --> 00:51:00,239
And that's where
you saw Erik Vik.

391
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,510
Yes.

392
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:08,544
l have compared the photos
with your statement.

393
00:51:15,027 --> 00:51:18,121
lt's not possible to see Erik Vik
in the water from the distance...

394
00:51:19,031 --> 00:51:20,623
Not in heavy fog.

395
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:27,800
l might have been
a few yards closer...

396
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:31,167
-You must have been 15...
-We're chasing a killer.

397
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,247
Would you like to change
your statement?

398
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:40,350
You do it, if you want to.

399
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:00,856
Hello...
Let me take you to the hospital.

400
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:04,761
-Where does bus 27 go?
-Pardon?

401
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:11,596
Bus 27. Follow it!

402
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:43,451
Thanks for calling.

403
00:55:45,064 --> 00:55:46,156
Have we met?

404
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,098
No...

405
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:54,705
but l've gotten to know someone
you used to know.

406
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:58,867
l know very few.

407
00:56:03,282 --> 00:56:07,378
Thin, little girl...
with dark hair.

408
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,248
-No, l don't think so.
-Don't pretend.

409
00:56:16,862 --> 00:56:19,126
You were stupid enough
to give her signed books.

410
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:21,926
My colleagues
are looking for you.

411
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:27,865
Oh, you mean the young girl
at the hotel reception...

412
00:56:30,776 --> 00:56:32,334
She's a blond, isn't she?

413
00:56:37,883 --> 00:56:39,748
Was it wise of you
to come to the hotel?

414
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:43,116
l needed some support.

415
00:56:43,455 --> 00:56:46,618
But you're never there
during the night... she said.

416
00:56:47,893 --> 00:56:49,258
She has nothing to do
with this.

417
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:53,592
No, but she's very cute...

418
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,360
Likes you, and... l can tell
these things straight away.

419
00:57:01,173 --> 00:57:02,834
What's her name again?

420
00:57:04,676 --> 00:57:06,769
l don't know.
You could have asked.

421
00:57:10,315 --> 00:57:13,773
You look good on TV.
lt's really strange...

422
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:18,618
l've always had such
deep respect for the police.

423
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:30,560
Yet sometimes one has to
alter the truth a bit.

424
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:32,636
An author understands that.

425
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:42,274
-Do you suffer from acrophobia?
-No.

426
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,334
l stood right behind you...
l saw you.

427
00:58:06,105 --> 00:58:09,199
Saw you lift the gun
and shoot your friend.

428
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:17,409
But the bullet we have is from
your gun... You lost your gun.

429
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:24,513
There's never been
any weapons registered to me.

430
00:58:46,778 --> 00:58:48,405
Couldn't you just
have admitted it?

431
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:51,077
A short suspension
and back to work,

432
00:58:51,216 --> 00:58:52,547
everything as it used to be.

433
00:58:56,622 --> 00:58:57,919
Nobody is perfect.

434
00:59:00,058 --> 00:59:01,855
You did nearly
everything right.

435
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,695
Enticed her out to a deserted
place. Beat her to death.

436
00:59:06,532 --> 00:59:08,625
Cleaned up after yourself.
Washed her...

437
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,266
Even washed her hair.

438
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,570
l've been doing those things
for 20 years.

439
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:22,243
Trying to imagine
what happens afterwards...

440
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:30,012
when you really cross
the line. What happens here.

441
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:34,122
The fiction became too boring...

442
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:39,063
When you've put
all the pieces together...

443
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,061
the account balances.
Nothing is missing.

444
00:59:44,736 --> 00:59:46,829
You have complete control.
Complete control.

445
00:59:47,439 --> 00:59:48,997
lt's all just mathematics...

446
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,910
But it's impossible
to calculate such a thing.

447
00:59:54,646 --> 00:59:57,342
You realize that afterwards,
when you've been there yourself.

448
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:02,213
-You know that...
-l know nothing of the sort.

449
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,482
What do you know
about her boyfriend?

450
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:13,193
-Who?
-Her boyfriend.

451
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,658
Eilert...

452
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:22,233
What about him?

453
01:00:23,308 --> 01:00:25,208
We'll have to make up
a story about him.

454
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:31,300
Do you think it's him?

455
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,468
Well, he met Tanja
several times.

456
01:02:41,246 --> 01:02:43,510
l'm looking for Froya Selmer.

457
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,406
Her parents don't know
where she is.

458
01:02:48,086 --> 01:02:51,214
-Who?
-You know her, don't you?

459
01:02:51,923 --> 01:02:55,086
-What does she look like?
-You spoke to her yesterday.

460
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:06,026
-What did she say?
-Not much. She was scared.

461
01:03:06,938 --> 01:03:09,805
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l'm telling you now.

462
01:03:09,941 --> 01:03:12,034
That's not good enough.
We have to cooperate.

463
01:03:16,181 --> 01:03:17,341
l'm sorry...

464
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:25,149
Shall we go in?

465
01:03:40,405 --> 01:03:42,669
Where were you
on the night of May 28th?

466
01:03:42,874 --> 01:03:44,341
l'm always at home
during the night.

467
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:47,472
That's when l write.

468
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,943
-Were you alone?
-Yes, l like to be alone at night.

469
01:03:54,085 --> 01:03:55,347
lt's worse during the day.

470
01:03:55,987 --> 01:03:59,479
-No alibi?
-l've never needed an alibi.

471
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:02,082
How did you get to know
Tanja Lorentzen?

472
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:08,765
She appeared at my door.
Strange girl.

473
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:14,135
She'd read one of my books.
Was very engaged in the story.

474
01:04:14,706 --> 01:04:17,231
She thought there was
something wrong with my angle.

475
01:04:18,176 --> 01:04:19,438
What was the book about?

476
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,508
Some youngsters who were
very co-dependent...

477
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:28,742
She has fantasies
about killing him to...

478
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:32,222
To get rid of him...
Read it yourself.

479
01:04:32,591 --> 01:04:33,489
l did.

480
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:37,122
What kind of relationship
did you have?

481
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:41,154
She thought it was exciting
to meet an author.

482
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,994
Did you have sex?

483
01:04:44,503 --> 01:04:45,595
She was about 15.

484
01:04:45,737 --> 01:04:48,228
-Did you have sex?
-No.

485
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:50,540
Why not?

486
01:04:58,884 --> 01:04:59,782
Why not?

487
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:11,558
l was like a father to her.
She had a lot of problems.

488
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:20,062
What kind of problems?

489
01:05:20,772 --> 01:05:22,399
She didn't want
to talk about them.

490
01:05:22,941 --> 01:05:24,465
So how do you know
she had problems?

491
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:27,605
She was always covered
in bruises...

492
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,545
On her arms... on her neck.
Everywhere.

493
01:05:31,716 --> 01:05:33,047
Did you ever ask her why?

494
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,581
She fell down when she drank.

495
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,193
You think her boyfriend
knocked her around?

496
01:05:44,629 --> 01:05:46,426
She had a lot of ''bad luck''.

497
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:52,730
You saw her several times.
Secret meetings.

498
01:05:52,971 --> 01:05:54,939
Became a father to her.

499
01:05:55,941 --> 01:05:58,341
But when she's murdered, you
don't even go to the police...

500
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:36,205
Come here...

501
01:06:39,818 --> 01:06:41,080
l'll show you something.

502
01:06:49,461 --> 01:06:50,485
Look here.

503
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:01,368
He can barely see you.

504
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:07,202
No... l suppose that's
just as well.

505
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:09,909
So he has something to look
forward to, you mean?

506
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:15,642
No, l think they're disgusting.

507
01:07:19,424 --> 01:07:20,914
They're just a bit helpless.

508
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:28,329
-Where is their mother?
-She died.

509
01:09:09,534 --> 01:09:13,800
-Don't touch me!
-l'm sorry... sorry.

510
01:09:14,005 --> 01:09:15,563
l just wanted to show you
the kittens.

511
01:09:36,628 --> 01:09:40,428
There is someone in the room.
l sit up in bed.

512
01:09:40,565 --> 01:09:42,760
They insist it's their room.

513
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:46,564
Yes, they insist. The guy
threatens to throw me out.

514
01:10:05,356 --> 01:10:12,956
l ask who the hell he thinks
he is. ''Erik Vik'' he says.

515
01:10:13,665 --> 01:10:16,099
l say: ''What?''
''Erik Vik, Oslo''.

516
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:28,774
The reception mixed up
the bookings.

517
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:56,536
-Hope you'll clean up.
-That's what we're doing.

518
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:07,852
Here!

519
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:18,262
That's not mine!

520
01:11:18,396 --> 01:11:21,297
Let me go!

521
01:11:33,611 --> 01:11:37,741
Jonas... is everything okay?

522
01:11:40,485 --> 01:11:41,782
l'm not sleeping well.

523
01:11:44,889 --> 01:11:45,821
You're sick.

524
01:11:46,157 --> 01:11:51,026
You've already made it all up
in your nasty mind.

525
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:52,456
You are so sick.

526
01:11:52,864 --> 01:11:56,265
Don't make this worse.
We've found your weapon.

527
01:11:56,701 --> 01:12:01,035
A bullet from it was found
in our colleague's chest.

528
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:03,173
What happened?
How did you get the gun?

529
01:12:04,242 --> 01:12:05,766
l don't have a gun, damn you.

530
01:12:07,946 --> 01:12:10,744
-Do you want an attorney?
-l haven't done anything...

531
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:20,684
l didn't do anything!

532
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:44,874
Back to Oslo's underworld?

533
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,116
No, l'm going home.
This was my last job in Norway.

534
01:12:49,554 --> 01:12:50,885
How can you take it?

535
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:55,648
Take what?

536
01:12:57,962 --> 01:13:01,864
Two bodies in one week.
l've had it up to here.

537
01:13:03,968 --> 01:13:08,769
lt made me think of you
seeing this year after year.

538
01:13:12,477 --> 01:13:13,705
You get used to it.

539
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,979
You just have to avoid mixing
your job and your personal life.

540
01:13:40,371 --> 01:13:41,531
What the hell do you want?

541
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:46,700
-ls everything okay?
-Of course.

542
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,840
-l don't know if l can trust you.
-What do you mean?

543
01:13:52,884 --> 01:13:56,047
You're not quite sane.
You don't even sleep at night.

544
01:13:56,554 --> 01:13:59,990
-Who told you?
-Tanja.

545
01:14:02,026 --> 01:14:05,291
She visits me at night.
Doesn't give in.

546
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:11,399
What else did she say?

547
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:21,170
That you should be careful
who you team up with.

548
01:14:23,781 --> 01:14:24,941
l should have known that.

549
01:14:27,351 --> 01:14:31,378
You should be very careful
who you team up with.

550
01:14:32,457 --> 01:14:34,254
Tanja should have
thought of that.

551
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:37,488
lt was an accident.

552
01:14:39,197 --> 01:14:40,892
She called me
in the middle of the night.

553
01:14:41,265 --> 01:14:43,665
She was wild.
Her boyfriend had dumped her.

554
01:14:44,402 --> 01:14:46,495
Do you understand?!
lt was an accident.

555
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:50,470
Don't worry.
Everything's been taken care of.

556
01:14:51,142 --> 01:14:56,842
She misunderstood.
l just wanted to comfort her.

557
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:02,512
But then l got so turned on.
She noticed.

558
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:07,121
Only once,
and that was too much.

559
01:15:07,258 --> 01:15:09,556
-Calm down!
-She didn't bleed much.

560
01:15:10,128 --> 01:15:13,689
She was just very tired.
l put her to bed.

561
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:20,437
Afterwards l tried to wake her,
but she just wanted to sleep.

562
01:15:21,873 --> 01:15:25,934
She slept and slept and slept...

563
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,479
Calm down now!

564
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:37,785
That friend of yours...
Did he get too close to you?

565
01:15:47,231 --> 01:15:48,858
Was that why you shot him?

566
01:15:57,675 --> 01:16:00,940
Go away. There's nothing
you can do.

567
01:16:02,847 --> 01:16:03,745
Get lost.

568
01:16:07,718 --> 01:16:09,709
l know about a quiet place...

569
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:12,520
where l can write.

570
01:17:32,837 --> 01:17:36,398
Nice to see you again.
We were worried about you.

571
01:17:37,008 --> 01:17:38,703
Your parents didn't know
where you were.

572
01:17:41,812 --> 01:17:43,677
Have you come
to tell us something?

573
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:46,279
She's going to drive me home.

574
01:17:58,663 --> 01:17:59,857
Somebody's lying in this case.

575
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:04,024
Froya tells me quite
a different story about Tanja.

576
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:06,964
-Like what?
-Eilert never hit her.

577
01:18:14,011 --> 01:18:18,004
Froya...
when did you last see Eilert?

578
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:20,776
ls that so important?

579
01:18:21,652 --> 01:18:24,485
l'm just trying to clarify
her relationship with Eilert.

580
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:27,982
You're in love with him,

581
01:18:30,328 --> 01:18:31,420
aren't you?

582
01:18:32,463 --> 01:18:35,432
lt was that writer.
He could get completely crazy.

583
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:40,196
Relax. Just get into the car
and l'll drive you home.

584
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:43,936
Eilert wasn't nasty.
He never was.

585
01:18:45,743 --> 01:18:47,108
One more thing...

586
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:53,176
The fingerprints on the actual
gun were wiped clean but Tom

587
01:18:53,317 --> 01:18:56,480
found one under the barrel
that didn't belong to Eilert.

588
01:18:58,589 --> 01:19:00,750
That just proves that
someone else touched the gun.

589
01:19:01,726 --> 01:19:03,284
l want Holt's fingerprints.

590
01:19:05,896 --> 01:19:09,457
-l'll get a search warrant.
-l've already got one.

591
01:19:11,769 --> 01:19:14,602
Good. Drive Froya home

592
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:18,038
and l'll see you at Holt's
apartment as soon as possible.

593
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:58,266
Nobody here.

594
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:50,225
We'll find him.
l'll put out an APB on him.

595
01:21:53,397 --> 01:21:55,388
Take his toothbrush
to start with.

596
01:21:56,967 --> 01:21:59,401
You'll probably find his
fingerprints on it.

597
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:17,084
Get some sleep.
You look tired.

598
01:23:39,703 --> 01:23:40,601
Jon!

599
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:48,464
Calm down.
l've just come to talk.

600
01:24:58,048 --> 01:24:59,709
l know it was an accident.

601
01:25:03,587 --> 01:25:07,318
She started to laugh...
she just laughed.

602
01:25:10,861 --> 01:25:12,055
l never touched her.

603
01:25:14,198 --> 01:25:17,224
You buy her dresses
for 20,000 kroners

604
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:19,699
and take her to a shed
to fuck her.

605
01:25:20,304 --> 01:25:23,068
Just once...
Just one single time.

606
01:25:28,946 --> 01:25:30,413
She took my hand...

607
01:25:32,983 --> 01:25:35,543
She touched my neck,
and then...

608
01:25:35,686 --> 01:25:37,813
she touched me above my eyes.

609
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:41,088
She smelt so strange.

610
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:43,250
And she was very warm.
Too warm.

611
01:25:43,827 --> 01:25:45,021
Didn't you manage?

612
01:25:48,532 --> 01:25:49,794
l tried.

613
01:25:51,635 --> 01:25:53,125
l don't want to listen
to that crap.

614
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,652
Wait!

615
01:29:36,393 --> 01:29:40,853
l've rarely come across
a more calculated killer.

616
01:29:42,165 --> 01:29:46,067
He planned every detail.
He even washed her hair.

617
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:50,865
lt's wrong.
Holt's no killer type.

618
01:29:51,008 --> 01:29:53,499
lt could've been an accident.

619
01:29:55,579 --> 01:29:57,012
He did shoot Vik.

620
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:01,346
Panic.

621
01:30:07,057 --> 01:30:10,049
l'm glad you're the one
who was called in.

622
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:17,991
l have to admit you really
lived up to your reputation.

623
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:21,736
Never gives up...
Not until the case is solved.

624
01:30:23,273 --> 01:30:26,936
Your spirit has been
an inspiration for all of us.

625
01:30:53,336 --> 01:30:55,566
Engstrom...
Am l disturbing you?

626
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,607
No, come in.

627
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,772
What a surprise.

628
01:31:21,932 --> 01:31:23,160
l've come to give you
something.

629
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:26,761
What?

630
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:33,001
l went back to the crime scene.
Found a cartridge case. A Norma.

631
01:31:40,584 --> 01:31:41,949
That's a Swedish make.

632
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:48,915
-The Swedish police use them.
-Yes.

633
01:31:58,168 --> 01:31:59,157
Say what you have to say.
