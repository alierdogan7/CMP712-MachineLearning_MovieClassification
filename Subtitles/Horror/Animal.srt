Alissa, you remember
where that turnoff is?

24
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,030
One or two miles past
the Holland Creek sign.

25
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,069

No.

Almost, man. This is the
road, but we still got...

30

- (SHOUTS) Huh?
- Almost!

(DRIVER) I don't know.

45
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,737
It's bullshit. It's a lie to keep people
quiet while they chop it all down.

46
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,106
It isn't nice to
fool Mother Nature.

47
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,945
No, it is not. They're chopping down
trees that are a hundred years old.

Yo. Someone's a little pissed.

Sorry.
No, it's okay.

That's why we came... to enjoy
what's here before it's gone.

52
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,490
Yeah.

00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,024
Guys, guys, guys.

54
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,160
Don't... Don't bring
any of that on the trail.

55
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,062
- Oh, it's coming. Yeah, it's coming.
- Shut up, Sean.

56
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,897
You're gonna get off my car.

57
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,968
- Actually, can we get around this thing?
- (SEAN) Yeah. Just knock it down.

58
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,504
So, this is the place you
were telling me about?

59
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,240
Almost. A little further down. But
might as well be the same thing.

60
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,941
It's all the same forest.

61
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,579
We used to camp here every summer.

62
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,048
It was like our one
family tradition.

63
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,818
Think this is gonna score me some
brownie points with your folks...

64
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,821
or, uh, your brother?

65
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,956
I wouldn't count on it.

66
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,158
All right, what do you think?

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,227
- Close enough?
- Here. This will be great.

68
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,695
- You sure?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,898
All right. Let's suit up.

to be fixing <i>your</i> backpack.

72
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,714
Oh, is it intimidating that your
girlfriend is used to the outdoors?

73
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,250
What? What? No.
No, I'm just saying...

74
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,920
at least I know you'll be
all right if I wasn't here.

75
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,855
Yeah, I'd be okay.

76
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:43,161
Hey. Sorry, man.
I'm just trying to hurry.

77
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,963
How much shit you put in there?

78
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,065
Just enough. You'll thank me later.

79
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,071
What about the rest of the
stuff? Is it gonna be safe here?

80
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,040
Yeah.

81
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,208
Better than losing it
in the woods, right?

82
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,046
Are you sure?

83
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,781
I'm sure.

84
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,883
Let's go. We're burning daylight.

00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,620
Are you sure?

86
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,255
Yeah, I'm sure.

87
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,058
At least you're not the drill
sergeant your brother is.

88
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,860
That's the "step" part. His dad.

89
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,996

- Ooh!

You are a natural beauty,
okay? It's a gift.

101

what we got and work it.

a reputation to uphold.

Oh, Liss.

All right, guys, get together.
Get closer.

Am I that obvious?

116

Relax.
Enjoy it.

00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,004
These woods won't even be
here in the next few years.

118
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,274
I will if you give me a kiss.

Dare me?
No!

122

Don't do it.

123
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,811
You dare me?

124
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,483
(SEAN)
So this is pretty much it, huh?

125
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:22,854
We just keep walking and then
turn around and walk back?

126
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,090
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

127
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,194
I'm taking you guys to this
amazing cave near the creek.

128
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,730
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,399
Alissa and I used to go swimming there
all the time when we were kids.

130
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,869
Swimming? You never said anything
about bringing a bathing suit.

131
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,010
Did I forget to tell you about...

132
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,039
- the bathing suit?
- You did.

133
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,977
What were you thinking?
You'll be fine without it.

134
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,180
Does it ever get awkward seeing your
best friend kiss your brother like that?

135
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,217
It was inevitable.
But yes.

136
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,519
So how long has it been for you?

137
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,363
It's been a while now...
like six or seven years.

138
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,323
Really?

139
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,792
We stopped coming after we moved.

140
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,528
The trip got too long
and we got busy.

141
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,832
- Yeah, it's a... it's a long-ass drive.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,434
But it's worth it though.

143
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,103
- It's gorgeous out here.
- I know.

144
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,439
Does it look familiar
at all to you?

145
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,776
Sort of looks familiar,
but it feels different.

146
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,978
Feels different.
Mm-hmm.

147
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,412
Feels different, how?

148
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,416
- I don't know.
- This different?

149
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,997
(CHATTERING)

150
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,132
(SEAN) Hey, Jeff, you never
said anything about this.

151
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,804
Oh, it's just a little
safety precaution.

152
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:51,242
He said that the tree cutting has been
displacing animals from the deeper areas.

153
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,912
(SEAN) Uh, does it work?
Yeah, it works.

154
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,014
Can of that stuff will send
a grizzly bear running.

155
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,283
Oh, so you've used it.
Yes...

156
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,952
Uh, no, I haven't used it,
but I know how to use it.

157
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,421
So if a giant bear comes
out of the woods right now,

158
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,857
and it's like... (GROWLING)
"I'm going to kill you, Jeff"...

159
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,393
- (JEFF) They don't talk.
- You're gonna be like, "Aah!"

160
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,161
And... And you're not worried?

161
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,096
Nope.
Not worried at all.

162
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,865
Well, shit, we gotta test this out.

163
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,834
Oh, be careful.
Be careful.

164
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,370
Fifty dollars to whoever lets
me spray them in the face.

165
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,507
- Give it to me.
- Fifty dollars for bear mace in the face.

166
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,309
- Going once.
- (WOMAN) You're an idiot.

167
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,578
(SEAN) You're right. I am
an idiot. A hundred dollars.

168
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,947
A hundred dollars for whoever
lets me spray them in the face.

169
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,317
- A man after my own cash. I like it.
- (ALISSA) No, you're not.

170
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,320
- (SEAN) Yes, he is.
- (MAN) It's a hundred bucks. Let's do it.

171
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,288

Also I texted your

00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,178
was vague,

400
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,280
but they said they're sending help.

401
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,015
Someone in the area. Friends.

402
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,418
Your parents know
people in the area?

403

can send someone to help.

always three of us.

it does slow down,

Holing up in a room is great.

570

There's only
two problems with that.

571
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:07,143
First, that thing bashes through
everything we put in front of it.

I don't?

How long have you
been here, sweetheart?

576

And I'm sorry, Vick.
Help isn't coming.

All right, dude, that's bullshit.
They said they traced my call...

Isn't that what they told you?
'Cause they told me the same thing.

that must not be very close.

Okay, but her parents,
they were gonna call...

585
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:40,009

into the nowhere woods?

Wow. Your parents must have some
really close friends out here.

us, we'll be easier to find there.

We have seen that thing. We've seen
how big it is and how strong it is,

00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,862
But what if he's barely alive?

850
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,330
How does that make a difference?

851
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,837
Give me that. You swing better
with less in your hands.

852
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,904
You guys are insane.

853
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,374
Wait. Hey, Al...

854
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:08,010
Uh, is it okay if I...

855
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,646
Can I sit this one out? I don't
think I can do it again.

856
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:12,881
I know.

857
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,718
Thank you.

858
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,187
You do realize that thing tried
to leap out of there earlier.

859
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,723
- If you open that door...
- Stop!

860
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,960
Here are your choices.

861
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:27,996
You can come with me
or you can stay here.

862
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:31,066
I don't trust you to
do anything else.

863
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,201
What'll it be?

864
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,776
That's what I thought.

865
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:44,413
If anything happens to me, my blood
is on your hands. You hear me?

866
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:45,981
On your hands!

867
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,386
Okay, you guys, ready?

868
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:53,155
Here we go. You close
the door behind us.

869
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:54,790
- No, no. I'm going with you.
- Vicky, no.

870
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,792
I'm going with you, Carl.

871
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:59,261
- You can't come with me.
- I can't... I can't keep running.

872
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,396
Stop. You gotta stop.
Carl, I'm going with you.

873
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,898
- Stop.
- No!

874
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,466
Stop!

875
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:07,035
I know you hate when people
tell you what to do,

876
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:10,405
but I can't very well go down there
and tell that thing who's boss...

877
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,474

878
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:15,177

(STAMMERING)

909

What's he... What's he saying?

910
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,098
He's dying, hon.

911
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,603
I'm sorry to say it. I truly am.

912
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:04,172
But someone has to.

913
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,274
Sporto's not gonna
last much longer.

914
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,144
We can still save him.

915
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,680
I don't think you can
be so sure about that.

916
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,451
But he can still save <i>us.</i>

917
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,390
He can be...
the diversion we need.

918
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:26,161
He can distract that thing
while we run for it.

919
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:29,097
You mean give it
something to chew on?

920
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,169
I was trying not to
say it like that.

921
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,339
Conversation's over, sicko.

922
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:40,175
He was willing to lay down his
life earlier for you guys.

923
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:42,644
Don't you see it? Now he can.

924
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:45,380
(SHUDDERING)
As bait?

925
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,482
- He's already dead.
- Not yet.

926
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,723
Carl was the most
capable of all of us.

927
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:58,326
If that thing got to him, how
can we hope to do any better?

928
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,330
Matt, dead, is our chance.

929
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,366
I'm not saying it's an
easy pill to swallow.

930
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:06,568
It's just fact.

931
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,636
If anybody has a better idea,

932
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:11,139
believe me, I'm all ears.

933
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:17,312
We know if we open that door,
that thing's coming in.

934
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:19,247
So let's trap it.

935
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,250
We torch this place, and we
get the hell out of here.

936
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,219
The same barricades
that kept that thing out...

937
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,321
will be the same ones
that keep it in.

938
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:28,156
The kerosene we found in the
cellar should be enough...

939
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:30,392
so we all can make
a run for safety.

940
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:33,528
And we don't need to worry
about needing any bait.

941
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,730
Being incinerated should
be distraction enough.

942

01:05:40,302 --> 01:05:41,736

Get us the hell out of here.

it now because he's not looking good.

only chance is if we hurry.

948
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,653

- It was so simple!

- You killed him!
- I didn't kill anyone, sweetheart.

was already ticking.

this sack of meat outside...

963

and let that thing in while we ran!
