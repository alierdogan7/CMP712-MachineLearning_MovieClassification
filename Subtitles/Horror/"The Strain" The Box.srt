- Oh, my God...

- They're all dead.

Someone leaked the Regis Air
documents to the internet.

75
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,063
It's carbon monoxide
poisoning. All of it covered up

76
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,065
by the airline's CEO, Daniel Flaxton.

77
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,101
You should be relieved, Doctor.

78
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:14,269

Now if you don't mind,

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,081

does not mean you're not sick.

83

90
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,832
We're going around in circles
here. Let me be very clear:

91
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,835
you're all staying here under
quarantine on my authority.

92
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,207
Director Barnes said we would be released.

93
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,410
And I say you stay. I
don't care what Barnes said.

94
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,378
According to the Health Powers Act,

95
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,414
it only takes two physicians
to issue a quarantine order.

96
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:01,450
It's on. One phone call, I get your job.

97
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:04,153

They have still not released the survivors.

107
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:32,247
If they continue to
treat this as an epidemic,

108
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,484

- In an hour,

109
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,953

110
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,823

survivors on the street.

151
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,796
Face the truth.

152
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:22,299
He is nothing but a
figment of your imagination.

153
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:27,938
Your arrest report says
you were apprehended

154
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:30,341

155
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:33,043
- Is it Sardu's?
- Don't worry.

156
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:38,816
I will give it back to
your Master in due time.

157
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,585
That is amusing.

158
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,787
And her heart...

159
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,056
Do you still have that as well?

160
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:53,430
Oh, you are such a sentimentalist.

161
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,368
You might like to know this.

162
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:00,237
She struggled at the very end,

163
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:02,473
but she never cried out.

164
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:06,243
I thought that strange. Not even a whimper.

165
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:08,946
Only a single word.

166
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:12,182
"Abraham."

167
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:14,351
But you were not there

168
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:16,520
to help her.

169
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:19,256
Do you feel great regret?

170
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:22,293
I will avenge her.

171
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:24,595
You will not avenge anyone.

172
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,797
You're not a hero or a savior.

173
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,799
You're just a number.

174
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,002
I took your name and gave you that number.

175
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,104
That's all you are.

176
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,048
It's good for you that you are in here.

177
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,850
It's the only place you can feel safe.

178
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:50,788
Safer than the streets will be very soon.

179
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:53,557
You might survive

180
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:56,393
a little longer.

181
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:58,395
I want you

182
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:01,932
to watch it unfold, unable to do anything

183
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,702
to stop it.

184
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,908
And when you die,

185
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,243
it will be the Master's eyes

186
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:15,479
you see last...

187
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,949
Remember your old friend,

188
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,452
Dreverhaven?

189
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:25,856
Would you like to know why

190
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:29,226
he isn't here to share your glory with you?

191
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:35,065
Because I cut him to pieces with that sword

192
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,267
and dumped his parts

193
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,703
in the North Sea.

194
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:43,474
I'll see that you're reunited with him

195
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:48,045
very soon.

196
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:53,417
Until next time...

197
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:59,923
A230385.

198
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,129
- (news bulletin on TV)
- _

199
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,031
(door opening)

200
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,295
Mama, I home!

201
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,307
She's getting ready for Mass.

202
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,413
Why don't you clean your shit up?

203
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:39,648
Shh! Listen.

204
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,851
- Plane coming in wit those stiffs on it?
- What did I say?

205
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,920
Huh?

206
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:47,589
- You think I'm playing with you?
- Hola, mijo.

207
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,192
Hola, mami!

208
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:53,095
Como estas? Mira, que
linda! You look beautiful.

209
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,898
You look... terrible.

210
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,934
Oh, mijo. I don't like you

211
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:01,837
working nights like this.
It's not good for you.

212
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:03,772
- I know.
- Come to Mass with me.

213
00:14:03,773 --> 00:14:05,741
Father Cortez has been asking about you.

214
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:08,444
I can't, Mama, I gotta get some sleep.

215
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,013
Next week.

216
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:14,550
Did you see what Crispin got me?

217
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,618
No, I didn't see it.

218
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,620
(chuckling excitedly)

219
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,689
Wow...

220
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,925
That's a nice piece.
Where'd you get it, bro?

221
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,060
Flea market.

222
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:27,463
Was a real steal. Old lady
didn't know what she had.

223
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:31,834
So good to have my two kids together again.

224
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:35,771
Your both will here for dinner?

225
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:38,674
- Si, Mama.
- I'll make something special.

226
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,642
- OK.
- Bye!

227
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:43,312
- Bye, Mommy, I love you.
- I love you too!

228
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,589
Where'd you get it? Huh?

229
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,692
Where d'you get it? The truth,
you junkie piece of shit!

230
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,827
Huh? Huh?

231
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,912
The pawn shop a couple blocks
down! The Jew who buys silver.

232
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,856
You don't bring stolen shit into this house

233
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,615
- and involve Mom on it.
- OK!

234
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:07,030
- You hear me?
- Yes!

235
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,980
You know, Gus, you got some balls

236
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,349
talking to me like that.

237
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,284
Two years.

238
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,286
Two years I listened to her
cry herself to sleep at night

239
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,954
while you were upstate.

240
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,223
I was the only one who was here for her!

241
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,292
You were shooting her
paychecks up your arm.

242
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,961
- OK, you got me.
- Yeah, I got you.

243
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,631
OK. But what about you, Gus, huh?

244
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,366
- What about me?
- How you long is it gonna be

245
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,336
before you get busted again
and break her heart? Huh?

246
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,672
I'm taking this clock back.

247
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:47,179
That's not gonna work you ***  , altar boy!

248
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,580
You contradicted my explicit orders

249
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,649
and declared them quarantined.

250
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,017
You can't release those survivors.

251
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,351
Not till we know what we're facing.

252
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,287
We do know. Let me introduce you

253
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,755
to the Secretarof Health
and Human Services,

254
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,123
Margaret Pierson.

255
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,025
Pleasure to meet you, Dr. Goodweather.

256
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,328
Dr. Martinez. Let me
bring you both up to speed.

257
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,597
These Regis Air documents

258
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,201
point to a systems
failure aboard flight 753.

259
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,537
So I've had the FAA ground
the entire Regis Airline fleet

260
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,873
until the NTSB completes its investigation.

261
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,641
It's not a CDC case anymore.

262
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,278
The NTSB has the ball now.

263
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,013
With all due respect, Madam Secretary,

264
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,049
these people didn't die
from a faulty air system.

265
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,184
- They didn't?
- Everything in my investigation

266
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,186
points to a virulent pathogen.

267
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,255
We're far from understanding
exactly what did happen,

268
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,024
but we need to shut down this
airport so it doesn't spread.

269
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,026
- Eph, please.
- Dr. Goodweather,

270
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,828
I appreciate ur zeal.

271
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,864
But you need to step back
for a moment and consider

272
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,866
the impact of a medical quarantine.

273
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,502
It would immediately stop all exports

274
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,837
from New York to he rest of the world.

275
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,073
Do you want to crash a $70 billion economy

276
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,076
and send the stock markets
into a free fall on a hunch?

277
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,777
Eph, I know you've been
under a lot of stress

278
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,546
in your personal life, that's
a big part of the cause.

279
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,982
- But don't bring your baggage...
- My personal life

280
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,884
has nothing to do with this.
It's about saving people.

281
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,554
It's that simple. Eph...

282
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,222
Sorry, Everett. I shouldn't have done that.

283
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,525
No, you shouldn't have.

284
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,193
Here's what's going to happen.

285
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,195
You're going to take a few days off.

286
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,430
Then once this all blows
over, we're going to revisit

287
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:17,673
your situation.

288
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,775
Go home.

289
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,051
<i>You've reached the office</i>

290
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,719
<i>of the Chief Medical
Examiner of New York City.</i>

291
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,521
<i>No one is available to take...</i>

292
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:34,623
I can't reach Bennett, or anybody.

293
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:37,526
Why aren't they picking
up at the coroner's office?

294
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,962
They got 206 dead bodies,
they're probably a little busy.

295
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:44,366
(soft music playing)

296
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,336
(news bulletin on TV)

297
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:59,348
Captain Redfern? Thanks
for agreeing to meet us.

298
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,650
You bet.

299
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:05,187
My passengers and crew trusted
me to get them to JFK safely.

300
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:08,791
But I didn't. I'd like to know why.

301
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,427
You look a little pale.

302
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:13,462
I'm OK. A bit of a headache.

303
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:16,331
There's that humming in my ears.

304
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:19,301
We do have a non-medical question for you.

305
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:21,762
A large piece of cargo has
gone missing from the plane.

306
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:29,118
You know about the box?

307
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,288
I was doing my pre-flight
walk around on the plane.

308
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,590
Four officials in suits show up

309
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,293
in a government van with this huge crate.

310
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:40,296
We've carried last-minute high-
security cargo in the past,

311
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,331
so I didn't think much of it.

312
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,800
This box, it was maybe
nine foot by four foot?

313
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:47,036
Yes.

314
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:49,338
Do you know what government
office? Who they were?

315
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,641
They got down onto the tarmac to my plane,

316
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:54,643
they had suits and badges...

317
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:56,979
I figured it had to be official.

318
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,448
Who am I to question this?

319
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,484
But because I didn't,

320
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,853
206 people are dead.

321
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:07,122
Other people are still in
danger. You can help save them.

322
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:10,059
Here's what you can do:
go to the emergency room

323
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,094
at St. Sebastian's.

324
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:14,530
A Dr. William Lester will meet you there.

325
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:16,999
Who's he?

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,101
He's the best diagnostician I know.

327
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:21,537
He'll admit you as a private patient,

328
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:23,672
as a favor to me, and run some tests.

329
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:26,375
He'll find out what's
causing the sound in your ears

330
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,976
- and your headaches.
- OK.

331
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:35,351
Unbelievable. Jumping
through all these hoops

332
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:38,420
because those bastards don't
want to face a quarantine.

333
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:42,491
And the airline's worried
about their liability,

334
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,827
my union is worried about theirs...

335
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,829
Everyone's first priority

336
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,131
is covering their asses.

337
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:51,200
And no one gives a shit about the truth.

338
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:53,836
I do, and you do,

339
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:56,839
and that's the best
shot we've got right now.

340
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,209
Oh, my God...

341
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,412
Its buccal cavity has serrated projections.

342
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,681
So it can latch onto or cut through tissue.

343
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:08,283
I want to try something.

344
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,156
Make it quick.

345
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:15,858
Before someone asks what
the hell we're doing here.

346
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,628
If these worms did infect the victims,

347
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:22,131
then human blood should
produce a tropic reaction.

348
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:33,842
Look at that...

349
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:45,320
(beeping)

350
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:49,958
It's Zack. I'm supposed
to stop by to talk about

351
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,628
- the custody hearing.
- You better go then.

352
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:54,830
No, this is important. He'll understand.

353
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:57,299
He'll understand he's not
as important as your work,

354
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,802
which is exactly what he hears
from his mother every day.

355
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:01,603
You want the judge to
give Kelly full custody?

356
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,605
Of course not.

357
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,008
Take a moment.

358
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,679
Redfern's test results won't
come in for a couple of hours.

359
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,549
I'll finish this.

360
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,084
Thank you.

361
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,269
See you at the hospital.

362
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,867
_

363
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:46,379
- What are you doing in here?
- Vasiliy Fet.

364
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,804
- Inspector, City Pest Control.
- On a Sunday?

365
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,206
No! You're not doing an inspection now.

366
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,241
There's no time... this
is our champagne brunch.

367
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:56,477
Busiest service of the week.

368
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:59,847
- Sorry. We had a complaint.
- You want breakfast?

369
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:02,116
Give the order to one of the line chefs.

370
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:05,119
But I am not giving you any cash.

371
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,521
Is that what you think I'm here for?

372
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:10,157
Ha! Look.

373
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,159
You see that?

374
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,194
That's rat urine.

375
00:22:14,195 --> 00:22:17,364
Ridiculous! OK,

376
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:20,634
two hundred dollars, but you get
the hell out of here right now.

377
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:23,938
- No.
- You're making a big mistake.

378
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,607
I make many mistakes, but not about vermin.

379
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:32,046
Move.

380
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,884
That was a $300,000 offer

381
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:39,019
for a 30-minute
on-camera interview.

382
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,788
- And you hang up?!
- Whatever they're offering,

383
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,723
it's gonna be chump change

384
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:44,758
compared to what we'll
get from the airline.

385
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,728
This may go in the category of "too soon,"

386
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:49,296
but ticket sales are way up.

387
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:51,498
That's what I love about you, Ruby.

388
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,668
Here's to being alive.

389
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:57,504
Moments like this... As an artist,

390
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:59,573
they make you take a step back

391
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:02,209
- and look at the big picture.
- There's no answer

392
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,579
to "why us." It's just
random luck, but I'll take it.

393
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,156
- (whirring sound)
- There's that... hum again.

394
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:18,559
You hear it still, don't you?

395
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,561
It's almost like an echo.

396
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:23,764
Like an echo of a voice,

397
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:26,367
maybe your own voice, when
your ears and nose are stuffed.

398
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:28,702
- It's weird.
- I'm not hearing it,

399
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:31,605
but Gabe, if that voice
has a tune, write it down.

400
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:34,475
Reminds me of my first acid trip.

401
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:38,512
You ever done acid, Joan?

402
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:40,481
Nope, no acid.

403
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:42,449
Not my thing.

404
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,485
What is your thing?

405
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:46,687
You want to take this party someplace else?

406
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,155
Like?

407
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,224
Townhouse above my new theater.

408
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:52,259
We can celebrate

409
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,695
our escape from the abyss.

410
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,925
No, I better get home

411
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:12,494
and see my kids. And my husband.

412
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,663
Maybe another time?

413
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:17,599
I'm going to be getting
together our legal team

414
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,068
at the firm tomorrow.
We'll talk soon, Gabe.

415
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:26,041
I need to get my pipes cleaned, Ruby.

416
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:29,244
Pick out a couple of hot ones.

417
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,954
Everyone stop what they're doing.

418
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:41,256
No more food goes out of the kitchen.

419
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:43,658
As of right now, you start cleaning...

420
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:45,994
if you ever want this
place to open up again.

421
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:47,629
You can't shut us down!

422
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,565
Councilwoman Shankar
eats here every Wednesday.

423
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:53,401
Oh yeah? You gonna serve her this?

424
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:57,272
Attention, everybody!

425
00:24:57,273 --> 00:24:59,641
By order of the health
department, this establishment

426
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:02,277
is now closed. All right?

427
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:07,596
Everyone must leave.

428
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,305
- Hey, hon.
- (Screaming)

429
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,609
- (all screaming)
- Time to go!

430
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,178
I'm guessing we don't have to pay.

431
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,582
(screaming)

432
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:30,119
Dr. Moise called with some good news, sir.

433
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,955
The liver's young and healthy.
It belongs to a laborer.

434
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,723
No family. He won't be missed.

435
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:36,158
Moise would like to move
ahead with the acquisition.

436
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm not sure I'll need it anymore.

437
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,596
With all due respect, sir,

438
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:42,998
if these other people can't
deliver what they've promised...

439
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,734
They can. And they will.

440
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:49,338
Even so, you should have a backup.

441
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,041
Keep in mind: it's a
five-hour flight to Bogota.

442
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,009
Minimum of eight hours
to harvest the organ.

443
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,778
Five more to return.

444
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,314
Your liver functionality is
already well below normal.

445
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:01,350
It could fail at any time. If it does fail,

446
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,352
it will be a challenge to keep you alive

447
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,321
until we receive the replacement.

448
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:08,257
All right. Fine.

449
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:10,993
- Do it.
- I'm not sure it's wis

450
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:15,262
to leave the building, sir.

451
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,697
My ability to withstand surgery.

452
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:20,634
Yes, yes, yes. I'm going.

453
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:23,203
There is no debate.

454
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:26,172
In fact, I've never felt
more excited about a meeting

455
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:29,609
in my entire life.

456
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:37,983
_

457
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,707
I agree, Nora: 101 degrees
is not cause for alarm,

458
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,010
but I don't like that
his temperature's rising.

459
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,325
Fine. I'll meet you back
at the hospital by the time

460
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:51,661
Redfern's path report gets back.

461
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,433
Good.

462
00:26:56,434 --> 00:27:00,136
Talk soon. Sorry.

463
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:03,139
- It's the airplane case.
- Yeah, I've been watching.

464
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,241
But why are you involved?

465
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:07,177
They say something was
wrong with the plane.

466
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,145
That's total bullshit. Nobody
wants to deal with the truth.

467
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:10,914
What is it?

468
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:13,149
I don't know.

469
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,285
Nothing's adding up.

470
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:18,254
- That's scary.
- It is.

471
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:20,690
Well, I'm glad you're handling it.

472
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:24,594
That means whatever needs
to be done will get done.

473
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:27,097
Thank you.

474
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:29,632
Oh, come in.

475
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:32,802
Matt's here.

476
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:38,608
- Hey, Eph.
- Hey...

477
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:42,112
Diane. My name's Diane. I've met you, like,

478
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:44,080
five times. I drive your kid
to school every other day,

479
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,049
and you can't even remember my name.

480
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,318
I remember your name,
Diane. I just drew a blank.

481
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,786
Funny, I've never drawn a blank about you.

482
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:51,721
Not once. Why is that, Eph?

483
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:54,491
Diane. Zack's in the back,

484
00:27:54,492 --> 00:27:57,360
- helping Matt.
- Do what?

485
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,295
We're converting your old office

486
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:01,631
into a game room.

487
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,473
Hey, Dad.

488
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:13,476
- Hey, Zack.
- How's it going, Eph?

489
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:15,845
OK.

490
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:18,882
So you're rebuilding this place, huh?

491
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:21,851
Yeah. Giant screen TV

492
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:24,421
over here. Perfect size
for a room like this.

493
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:26,322
Speakers here, and here.

494
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:29,105
This'll be a great new space for us.

495
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:32,509
Listen... I know this is awkward,

496
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,644
but I don't want it to be.

497
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:36,646
Um...

498
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,783
Just make her happy.

499
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,953
Just make them happy. That's all I ask.

500
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,423
You got it.

501
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,459
Oh. Oh, OK.

502
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,494
Great.

503
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:53,630
Mind if I speak with my son?

504
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,200
No, of course. You know, in time,

505
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,837
I bet you and I will become good friends.

506
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:02,806
Maybe.

507
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,808
Hey, Zack, Zack, I gotta go.

508
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,411
Because of that plane. I know.

509
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,447
I wanted to talk about

510
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,515
- the custody hearing tomorrow.
- OK.

511
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:15,518
- Just don't be late.
- I won't. I won't be.

512
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,488
- I mean it.
- So what about it?

513
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:20,824
Uh...

514
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,827
It is a weird situation,
huh, for all of us?

515
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,863
Mom says the judge will
ask all kinds of questions.

516
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:30,033
Yeah, he will. Or she will.
Whoever it is, they will.

517
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,336
Have you thought about
what you were gonna say?

518
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:35,568
Mom says I should just say how I feel.

519
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:37,236
K from your heart.

520
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:39,939
- What are you gonna say?
- Me? Same thing.

521
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,341
My feelings. I'm gonna say

522
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,377
you're the most important person

523
00:29:44,378 --> 00:29:46,879
in the world to me, because you are,

524
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,682
- and that I want joint custody.
- What's that?

525
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,385
That means...

526
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:54,453
that you get to spend as much time with me

527
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:56,455
as you do with your mother.

528
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:58,357
And I know that's what you want, right?

529
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:00,359
Yeah... But if you're always so busy...

530
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,395
I won't be, not after
I put this case to bed.

531
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:05,865
You always say that.
And I know you mean it,

532
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:09,268
- but it's never true.
- Zack, Zack, look at me...

533
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:11,571
This time,

534
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:15,274
it will be.

535
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,094
I didn't think you were gonna show.

536
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:37,763
Keeping commitments is...

537
00:30:37,764 --> 00:31:06,954
Is part of my recovery process.

538
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:09,857
Hi, my name's Eph.

539
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:13,928
- I'm an alcoholic.
- (Greetings)

540
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:16,397
I've been sober one year

541
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,933
and eleven days.

542
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:22,103
I'm in therapy.

543
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:25,039
Learning about myself.

544
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,109
It's a journey of discovery. Uh...

545
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,345
I'm passive-aggressive
and actively aggressive,

546
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:34,582
which is a rare combination, I'm told.

547
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:38,386
Let's see, what else? I'm
controlling. I'm self-centered.

548
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:40,922
I'm emotionally distant for my family.

549
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,957
Oh, and the greatest sin of all:

550
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:45,226
I love my work.

551
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:50,714
But I'm taking it all in,
you know, I'm owning it.

552
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:54,284
And it's really making a difference.

553
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:56,853
My wife's divorcing me,

554
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:59,890
and screwing this new dude...

555
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:02,159
in my bed. In my house,

556
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,561
on which I'm still making payments.

557
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:10,067
There I go again, right,
Richard? My sponsor says

558
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:12,302
that I use sarcasm to
avoid my real feelings,

559
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:15,505
that if I truly loved Kelly,
I would be happy for her,

560
00:32:15,506 --> 00:32:18,075
I wouldn't resent her...

561
00:32:20,345 --> 00:32:23,013
I'm trying, Richard.

562
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,749
But it is a very steep hill.

563
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,454
I saw them right before I came here.

564
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:32,556
All three of them together.

565
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,594
Doing things I never had time to do,

566
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:40,697
still don't have time to do...

567
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:43,033
I wanted a drink.

568
00:32:43,034 --> 00:32:46,169
I passed a bar after I left there.

569
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,139
But I came here.

570
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,519
Because I can't blow it with Zack.

571
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,222
Ecse that I have left.

572
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,831
He's my whole world.

573
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:21,010
(applause)

574
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:30,219
(muffled music)

575
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:44,467
(hard rock music)

576
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:46,902
Are you ready to party with me?

577
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:49,271
Yeah!

578
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:52,041
(giggling)

579
00:34:00,217 --> 00:34:02,518
You smell beautiful. I
bet you taste even better.

580
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:10,926
- You okay, Gabe?
- Yeah, yeah.

581
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,228
I'm still on German time.

582
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:16,031
Keep the beat going. I'll catch up.

583
00:34:22,205 --> 00:34:25,374
(sound of blood pumping)

584
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:36,352
- (screaming)
- You bit me, you bastard!

585
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:39,388
- Bullshit.
- I'm bleeding. He bit me hard!

586
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,424
Get out.

587
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:43,893
Get out! Out!

588
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:49,064
Out! You're crazy!

589
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:03,913
(sound of blood pumping)

590
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,282
- _
- What's wrong?

591
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,621
Redfern just went into a tailspin.

592
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:15,889
Lester's with him. Here's the path report.

593
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,192
I've never seen anything like it.

594
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,364
This is crazy: Aberrant, foreign cells...

595
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:25,933
nuclear pleomorphism.

596
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,202
Biphenotypic appearance...
It's like something

597
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:30,237
shanghaied his cellular machinery

598
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,139
and is creating something
totally different.

599
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,376
We've sedated him for the
pain, started fluids, but...

600
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:37,478
- Antibody studies back in yet?
- No.

601
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:40,714
- How you feeling, Doyle?
- Boiling.

602
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:44,318
Skin's crawling. I feel like
I swallowed a razor. UV light.

603
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:48,822
Watch your eyes.

604
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:53,327
A scar. Same place as the airline victims.

605
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:54,695
It just healed so fast

606
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,230
we couldn't see it without UV light.

607
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:57,331
Eph, look!

608
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,074
Jim, find Barnes. Tell him
that Redfern's gone critical.

609
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:08,776
He's gonna be really
pissed when he finds out

610
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:10,711
you've been treating him. I
don't give a shit! Tell him

611
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,413
that one of the survivors is very sick.

612
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:13,747
Tell him we need to corral
the rest of the survivors

613
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:15,349
and anybody they've had contact with.

614
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,284
Now. Yes, sir.

615
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:18,786
The autopsies should have
turned something up by now.

616
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,487
Dr. Bennett is still not answering.

617
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,289
It went straight to voice mail again.

618
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,324
Well, if the mountain
won't come to Mahomet...

619
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:26,326
We're going to the morgue.

620
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:29,830
<i>Dr. Goodweather? This is
Laurie from the CDC exchange.</i>

621
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:32,499
<i>- There's a Gary Arnot calling.
- Yeah, OK.</i>

622
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,668
<i>Hello? Yes, Doctor,</i>

623
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:36,303
this is Gary Arnot.

624
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:38,639
<i>- I'm Emma's...
- I know who you are, Mr. Arnot.</i>

625
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,008
<i>First of all, I just wanted to say</i>

626
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:43,310
that I'm sorry for what I did,

627
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:46,046
and to thank you for sending
my little girl home to me.

628
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:50,350
What? Are you saying someone
released her body to you?

629
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:52,386
No, not her body.

630
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:54,822
Emma's alive. She showed up
on my doorstep this morning.

631
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:57,925
Uh, Mr. Arnot, I'm a little confused.

632
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,993
- Are you telling me...
- You don't believe me?

633
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:01,728
<i>You know what? Fine, whatever.</i>

634
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:04,198
<i>- I'm just trying to...
- My daughter's home safe.</i>

635
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,300
That's all that matters.
Thank you very much.

636
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:10,537
Do you think it's possible she's alive?

637
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:11,972
He's in shock. He's seeing ghosts.

638
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,575
I examined her in her seat, she's dead.

639
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:15,909
When we boarded that plane,
everybody looked dead.

640
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,511
Then four of them woke up.

641
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:21,582
Could these worms somehow induce

642
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,884
some sort of state of hibernation?

643
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:26,120
Like tsetse flies?

644
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:28,489
We'll find out in ten minutes.

645
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,624
If she's dead, she'll be at the morgue.

646
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:41,468
Sir?

647
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,103
I know you don't wanna hear this,

648
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:45,005
but I've been with you
a long time and listened

649
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:48,575
to a lot of doctors
promise you a lot of things.

650
00:37:48,576 --> 00:37:50,944
I've seen what can be done and what can't.

651
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:54,381
These people... They're deceiving you.

652
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:57,484
These people have power

653
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:00,354
beyond anything you can imagine.

654
00:38:00,355 --> 00:38:04,458
In time, you also will
benefit from that power.

655
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:08,362
Stay with the car.

656
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:11,465
I need to do this alone.

657
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,511
The sun has fallen.

658
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:02,382
You are very fortunate, Mr. Palmer.

659
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:08,355
He has chosen you to
bear witness to his glory.

660
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:20,200
(growling)

661
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,708
Welcome to the New World.

662
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:30,444
You brought me all the way here.

663
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:38,118
Aren't you going to look at me?

664
00:39:57,238 --> 00:40:00,140
(whimpering)

665
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:04,511
(creature growling)

666
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:07,814
- Hello? Anybody here?
- (Phones ringing)

667
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:17,624
Dr. Bennett?

668
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:21,461
Dr. Bennett, you OK?

669
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,081
Hello?

670
00:40:43,518 --> 00:40:47,321
(clanking)

671
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:57,631
Every bag is empty. Every single one.
