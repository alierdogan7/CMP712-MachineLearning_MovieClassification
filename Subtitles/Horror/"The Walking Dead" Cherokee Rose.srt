2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,769
I'll have to open him up and Stitch it.

3
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:06,824
You'll need a respirator

4
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,052
I'll take care

5
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:10,494
I'm gonna walk the road,
look for the girl.

6
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:12,468
Let's go, you and me.

7
00:00:12,941 --> 00:00:14,105
We're gonna locate
that little girl.

8
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,251
'Cause they think
we're the weakest.

9
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:18,465
- Down to my last.
- Me too.

10
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,285
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:24,091
Pressure is stable.

12
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:16,499
Fever's gone down.

13
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,306
Baby?

14
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,273
<i>Carl?</i>

15
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:29,608
Sophia?

16
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,505
Is she okay?

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,224
Fine.

18
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>- She's fine.
- Rest.</i>

19
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:39,408
We'll be right here, okay?

20
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:41,485
Okay.

21
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:53,197
They're here.

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,217
How is he?

23
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:11,706
He'll pull through,

24
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,952
thanks to Hershel
and his people.

25
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,752
And Shane.

26
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,460
We'd have lost Carl
if not for him.

27
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:27,319
Thank God.

28
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:29,139
We were so worried.

29
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:31,264
- How'd it happen?
- Hunting accident.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,039
That's all...
Just a stupid accident.

31
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:44,032
Blessed be God,

32
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:47,741
father of our lord
Jesus Christ.

33
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,251
Praise be to him

34
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:54,085
for the gift
of our brother Otis,

35
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:57,355
for his span of years,

36
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,714
<i>for his abundance
of character;</i>

37
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:02,946
<i>Otis, who gave his life
to save a child's,</i>

38
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:06,304
<i>now more than ever,
our most precious asset.</i>

39
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:10,551
<i>We thank you, God, for the peace
he enjoys in your embrace.</i>

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,341
He died as he lived,

41
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:15,316
in Grace.

42
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,873
Shane, will you speak
for Otis?

43
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:23,885
I'm not good at it.

44
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,190
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,304
<i>You were the
last one with him.</i>

46
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:30,955
You shared
his final moments.

47
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,603
<i>Please.</i>

48
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:34,351
<i>I need to hear.</i>

49
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:38,075
I need to know
his death had meaning.

50
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,793
Okay.

51
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,237
We were about done.

52
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:50,741
Almost out of ammo.

53
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,832
<i>We were down
to pistols by then.</i>

54
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,819
<i>I was limping.
It was bad.</i>

55
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,447
Ankle all swollen up.

56
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:01,749
"We've got
to save the boy."

57
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,363
See, that's what he said.

58
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:10,927
He gave me his backpack.
He shoved me ahead.

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,324
"Run," he said.

60
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,998
He said, "I'll take the rear.
I'll cover you."

61
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,036
And when I looked back...

62
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,962
If not for Otis,

63
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,572
I'd have never
made it out alive.

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,840
<i>And that goes
for Carl too.</i>

65
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,710
It was Otis.

66
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,709
He saved us both.

67
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:59,109
If any death
ever had meaning,

68
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,405
it was his.

71
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,663
How long has this girl
been lost?

72
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,927
This'll be day three.

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,358
County survey map.

74
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,465
Shows terrain
and elevations.

75
00:05:57,802 --> 00:06:01,037
This is perfect.
We can finally get this thing organized.

76
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,446
We'll grid the whole area,
start searching in teams.

77
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,436
Not you.
Not today.

78
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,477
You gave three units
of blood.

79
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:11,526
You wouldn't be hiking five minutes
in this heat before passing out.

80
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:14,663
And your ankle...
Push it now, you'll be laid up a month,

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,547
no good to anybody.

82
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,186
Guess it's just me.

83
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,936
I'm gonna head back to the
creek, work my way from there.

84
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,735
I can still be useful.

85
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,752
I'll drive up to the interstate,
see if Sophia wandered back.

86
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:28,128
All right, tomorrow then.

87
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:30,107
We'll start doing this right.

88
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,467
That means we can't have our
people out there with just knives.

89
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:35,938
They need the gun training
we've been promising them.

90
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:40,343
I'd prefer you not carrying
guns on my property.

91
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:44,834
We've managed so far without
turning this into an armed camp.

92
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:48,619
All due respect, you get a crowd of
those things wandering in here...

93
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,598
<i>Look, we're guests here.</i>

94
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,921
This is your property

95
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,217
<i>and we will respect that.</i>

96
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,284
<i>Set camp, find Sophia.</i>

97
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:11,061
I hate to be the one to ask,
but somebody's got to.

98
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,206
What happens if we find her
and she's bit?

99
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,677
I think we should all be
clear on how we handle that.

100
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,330
You do what has to be done.

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,338
And her mother?
What do you tell her?

102
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:23,881
The truth.

103
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,760
<i>I'll gather and
secure all the weapons.</i>

104
00:07:25,798 --> 00:07:28,710
<i>Make sure no one's carrying till
we're at a practice range off site.</i>

105
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,709
I do request
one rifleman on lookout.

106
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:34,152
Dale's got experience.

107
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,446
Our people
would feel safer,

108
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:40,861
less inclined
to carry a gun.

109
00:07:44,393 --> 00:07:46,972
Thank you.

110
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:49,352
That stuff you brought,

111
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:51,714
got more antibiotics,
bandages, anything like that?

112
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:55,463
Just what you've seen.

113
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:58,085
We're running short already.
I should make a run into town.

114
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,641
Not the place Shane went?

115
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,329
No, there's a pharmacy
just a mile down the road.

116
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:04,064
I've done it before.

117
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,648
See our man there
in the baseball cap?

118
00:08:07,714 --> 00:08:09,279
That's Glenn,

119
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,862
our go-to-town expert.

120
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,077
I'd ask him along
just to be cautious.

121
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,044
I hear he woke up.

122
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,765
Yeah. He's in
and out, but yeah.

123
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:35,053
He'll be all right.

124
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,681
That's good.

125
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,419
Did you mean it?

126
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:45,424
What?

127
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,223
You said stay.

128
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,070
Did you mean it?

129
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:54,028
Look, if you didn't
just say so.

130
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,824
But do it now.
I need to know.

131
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,511
I meant it.

132
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:06,171
All right then.

133
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:22,639
I hear you're fast on your feet
and know how to get in and out.

134
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,761
Got a pharmacy run.
You in?

135
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,730
Uh...

136
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:32,232
Miss, what's the water
situation here?

137
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,051
Got five wells on our land.

138
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:36,552
House draws directly
from number one.

139
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,325
Number-two well
is right over there.

140
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,989
We use it for the cattle
but it's just as pure.

141
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,417
Take what you need.
There's a cart and containers

142
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,623
in the generator shed
behind the house.

143
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:47,535
I'll go saddle
your horse then.

144
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,198
Horse?

145
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,613
Give up our guns?

146
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,508
You heard Rick.
We're guests here.

147
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,045
And you're okay with it?

148
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,358
I don't recall being asked.
Now lay down your weapon.

149
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,643
You may like rolling over,
I don't.

150
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:08,651
Look, I have to strip and clean them anyway.
You still want to learn?

151
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:12,126
Go on.

152
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,397
All right.

153
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,200
Sit down.

154
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,573
Unload your weapon.

155
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,326
Hey hey.

156
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,995
Check the chamber.

157
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,179
Pull it back.

158
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:29,283
Push that lever out.

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,754
<i>It'll slide off.</i>

160
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,173
You're halfway there.

161
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,987
Daryl.

162
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:49,632
You okay on your own?

163
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:52,703
I'm better on my own.
I'll be back before dark.

164
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,895
Hey.

165
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:57,181
We got a base.

166
00:10:57,183 --> 00:11:00,408
We can get this search
properly organized now.

167
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,185
You got a point
or are we just chatting?

168
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:04,651
My point is it lets
you off the hook.

169
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:07,644
You don't owe us
anything.

170
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,236
My other plans
fell through.

171
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,146
We could give you
more space.

172
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,121
Set up over by the barn.

173
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,505
No, no need for that.

174
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:28,160
Better you stay close
to the house.

175
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,288
I don't say
this easily, Rick.

176
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,011
We don't normally
take in strangers.

177
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:36,297
I can't have your people
thinking this is permanent.

178
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,820
Once you find this girl
and your boy's fit for travel,

179
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:42,386
I expect you'll move on.

180
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,431
We need to be clear on that.

181
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:01,346
<i>Hello, farmer's daughter.</i>

182
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,588
Hi.
Here's your list.

183
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,965
And, um,

184
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,885
there's one other item.
I wrote it down separately.

185
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,941
It's personal. If we could be
real discreet about that, okay?

186
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,809
Sure.

187
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,912
Thank you.

188
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,564
Uh, what is it?

189
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:29,845
Kind of missing the point of the
whole discreet thing, Glenn.

190
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,435
Oh, right.
Um...

191
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,821
I just need to know
where to find it.

192
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,919
Try the feminine
hygiene section.

193
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:42,991
Oh.
Enough said.

194
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,897
Consider it done.

195
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:53,477
I'm not weak
and I'm not a coward.

196
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:55,264
I never said you were.

197
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,147
No, what I said
on the highway...

198
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,492
I don't know
what that was,

199
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,594
where it came from.

200
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,172
That wasn't me.

201
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:11,004
If it's okay, I'd rather you never
told anybody about that stuff I said.

202
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,247
What stuff?

203
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:17,126
I couldn't get a word
out of you all day.

204
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,773
Say, man, you think
there's a snowball's chance

205
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,241
we'll actually find
that little girl?

206
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:30,712
For the first time in my life
I'm betting on the snowball.

207
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,698
Yeah.

208
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,617
Me too.

209
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,365
Do whatever we have to.

210
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,923
I don't care if I have to
comb the woods like Rambo

211
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:43,140
or fetch a pail of water.

212
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,814
Everyone kicks in,
does their part.

213
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,239
<i>Am I right?</i>

214
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:53,743
Do your part,
don't complain.

215
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,965
That's what I always...

216
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:59,571
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

217
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,891
Looks like we've got us
a swimmer.

218
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,198
How long you think it
has been down there?

219
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,299
Long enough to grow gills.

220
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,800
We can't leave it in there.
God knows what it's doing to the water.

221
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,648
We got to get it out.

222
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,266
Easy. Put a bullet
in its head.

223
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,122
<i>I'll get a rope.</i>

224
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,339
Whoa whoa, guys.
No.

225
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:40,378
Why not?
It's a good plan.

226
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,022
It's a stupid plan.

227
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,659
If that thing hasn't
contaminated the water yet,

228
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:46,749
<i>blowing its brains out
will finish the job.</i>

229
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:49,631
She's right.
Can't risk it.

230
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,150
So it has to come out alive?

231
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,184
So to speak.

232
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:55,450
How do we do that?

233
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:00,421
The interstate where you
broke down is here.

234
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:02,572
There's your creek.

235
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,297
My farm is here.

236
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,809
We're looking out
that way,

237
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,824
south-southeast.

238
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:11,289
We missed this branch
of the creek entirely.

239
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,238
If she went
that direction,

240
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,455
she'd be miles
from where we looked.

241
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,086
Rick, take a moment.

242
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,988
Come look.

243
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,860
That's something, isn't it?

244
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,502
It's good to pause for
an occasional reminder.

245
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:36,944
Of what?

246
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:38,877
Whatever comes to mind.

247
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:41,268
For me it's often God.

248
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,088
No thoughts on that?

249
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:47,038
Last time I asked God for a favor
and stopped to admire a view

250
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,375
my son got shot.

251
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:52,246
I try not to mix it up
with the almighty anymore.

252
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:57,424
Best we stay out
of each other's way.

253
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,393
Lori told me your story...

254
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,671
How you were shot,
the coma.

255
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,577
Yet you came
out of it somehow.

256
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,576
You did not feel
God's hand in yours?

257
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:11,652
At that moment?

258
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:13,939
No, I did not.

259
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,372
In all the chaos you
found your wife and boy.

260
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:19,294
Then he was shot
and he survived.

261
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:20,990
That tells you nothing?

262
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:26,080
It tells me God's got
a strange sense of humor.

263
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:44,728
He's not going for it.

264
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:46,980
Maybe 'cause a canned ham
don't kick and scream

265
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:48,303
when you try to eat it.

266
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,636
He's right. There's a reason the
dead didn't come back to life

267
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,565
and start raiding
our cupboards.

268
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,440
We need live bait.

269
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:08,457
Have I mentioned that I
really like your new haircut?

270
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,558
You have
a nice shaped head.

271
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,512
Don't worry about it, bud.

272
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,394
We're gonna get you out
of here in one piece.

273
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:17,778
Living piece.
That living part is important.

274
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,311
- Nice and slow, please.
- We got you.

275
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:27,508
Oh, you people are crazy.

276
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,282
You want to get it out
of your well or not?

277
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:31,293
Give us an eye
there, Maggie.

278
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:49,229
Doing okay?

279
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,269
Yup, doing great.

280
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,317
Living the dream.

281
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,951
<i>Little lower. Little more.</i>

282
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,357
- Get it! Get it!
- Grab it!

283
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:22,016
Grab it!

284
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,830
Get me out of here!

285
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,508
Get it off.
Get off.

286
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,217
Get off!
Get me out!

287
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:45,462
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

288
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,852
Guys, get me out!

289
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:50,938
Come on, you guys.
Get me out!

290
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:55,992
Oh God. Oh God.
Oh my God!

291
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:58,298
Get me out of here!

292
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:00,190
- Pull!
- Pull! Pull!

293
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:01,935
- Pull! Pull!
- Let's go, pull.

294
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,870
Get me out.
Get me out.

295
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:08,071
Come on.
Come on.

296
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,573
- Glenn!
- Pull him up!

297
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,326
Pull him up!
Pull him up!

298
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,904
Get me out of here!

299
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:21,001
Pull him up.
Pull him up.

300
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,280
Are you okay?

301
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:31,518
Back to the drawing board.

302
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:36,361
Says you.

303
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,606
Atte

304
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,651
<i>- Come on, guys, pull.
- Come on, y'all.</i>

305
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,705
<i>- Almost there.
- Come on, pull, s.</i>

306
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,797
<i>- Come on.
- Pull!</i>

307
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:27,724
Come on, y'all.
Together.

308
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,040
Almost there. Come on, pull.
Keep it coming.

309
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,171
<i>Come on, pull.
Watch out, dawg.</i>

310
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:33,969
<i>Nice and easy.
Just a little more.</i>

311
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:38,101
Come on, almost there.

312
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,162
<i>You got to pull it, man.</i>

313
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:42,427
It's stuck!
Come on.

314
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:48,068
<i>Come on, pull!</i>

315
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:49,956
Pull!

316
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:12,873
We should seal off
this well.

317
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,214
Yeah, might be
a good idea.

318
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:16,850
So what do we do about...

319
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:32,702
Good thing we didn't do
anything stupid like shoot it.

320
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:55,791
We'll come again tomorrow.

321
00:23:56,473 --> 00:23:58,000
You know there's
always the chance...

322
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:01,667
Don't. I really don't need
to hear it anymore, Andrea.

323
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,767
Save the thoughts
and prayers.

324
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,537
You never know, Carol.

325
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:29,810
We can hang targets along
that fence line there.

326
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:32,153
That rise, it gives
a natural backstop.

327
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,652
It's a good idea.

328
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:37,439
Thanks.

329
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:39,532
So how long
before I can carry?

330
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,894
Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

331
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:44,739
I'm not in a very patient
frame of mind these days, Shane.

332
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:47,169
- You might have notice that.
- No shit.

333
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,811
Look, I ain't worried
about you offing yourself,

334
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,669
even though you got old Dale
pissing his pants lately.

335
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,904
<i>Yeah, I noticed that too.</i>

336
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:01,032
He did come within a minute
or so of being blown to hell

337
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,827
because of me,
to be fair.

338
00:25:02,832 --> 00:25:06,520
Look, I see you have
the desire for gun work

339
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:08,338
and desire will take
you a long way.

340
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:11,032
But something you need to
know, so file this carefully.

341
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,767
- I'm listening.
- Paper targets is one thing.

342
00:25:13,802 --> 00:25:15,492
Easy to hit
what ain't moving.

343
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,687
But taking down
an assailant,

344
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:19,626
one that's trying
to kill you,

345
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,809
it's different.

346
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,012
They say in that
kind of situation

347
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:29,743
<i>things slow down.
That's crap.</i>

348
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:32,020
<i>They speed up.
Adrenalin, ha.</i>

349
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:34,515
It'll cripple you
if you let it.

350
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:36,401
You need to use
your instinct.

351
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,121
You got to rule it out.

352
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:42,185
Because somebody
is going to die

353
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:45,070
and you'd better hope that you're
the one who's making that decision.

354
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:48,561
How?
I mean, how do you do that?

355
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:51,355
Turn off a switch.

356
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,629
<i>The switch.</i>

357
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:58,336
The one that makes
you scared or angry,

358
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,348
sympathetic, whatever.

359
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:03,829
You don't think.
You just... you act.

360
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:08,319
<i>'Cause odds are somebody else
is counting on you.</i>

361
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:11,167
<i>That's your partner.</i>

362
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:13,081
That's your friend.

363
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,378
There ain't nothing easy
about taking a man's life

364
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:20,986
no matter how little
value it may have.

365
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,460
But when you get it done,

366
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:26,771
you have to forget it.

367
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:34,445
I guess I haven't quite
got that last part down yet.

368
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:38,941
But you're getting there?

369
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,730
I hope so.

370
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,613
It's a good spot.

371
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,022
It'll do.

372
00:26:57,929 --> 00:26:59,964
You know, normally

373
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,946
this is the kind of thing
I'd do on my own.

374
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:04,410
Solo.

375
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:06,882
It's sort of my thing,
you know?

376
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:09,641
I'm a loner.

377
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,948
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

378
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:21,619
I saw the look on your face
back at the well.

379
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,971
Never seen one
killed up close before?

380
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,197
Guess it's kind
of a shock.

381
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:33,468
<i>You know, being out on
the road, we've seen a lot.</i>

382
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,232
Guess we've gotten
a little numb to it.

383
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:41,648
Whoa.
I guess so.

384
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,610
I'll go see what
antibiotics are left.

385
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:03,326
What else is on the list?

386
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:05,609
Uh...

387
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,092
Why don't you get started?

388
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,586
What about you?

389
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:12,473
I'm gonna look around,
see what's worth grabbing.

390
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,888
Just some general stuff.

391
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,138
What do you got?

392
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:51,072
Uh... um...

393
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,758
Nothing.

394
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,048
Just, like I said,
general stuff.

395
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:56,989
Condoms?

396
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,779
You got a girlfriend
I don't know about?

397
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,740
Me? No.
No.

398
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:05,487
Then you're a pretty
confident guy.

399
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:09,233
No.

400
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:11,520
No no no.
I-I-I wasn't...

401
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:13,362
<i>- I would never...
- Something wrong with me?</i>

402
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:15,223
No.

403
00:29:15,225 --> 00:29:17,196
No, I...

404
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:20,926
I would never have sex...

405
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,370
Uh, I'm... I'm lost.

406
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:29,945
I'll have sex with you.

407
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:34,524
Really?

408
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,387
Why?

409
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:37,945
You're asking questions?

410
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:40,877
Okay, I can't help
wondering.

411
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:43,161
It's not like our options
are vast these days.

412
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:08,148
And you're not the only one
that's lonely.

413
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:28,593
Wow.

414
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,279
You need to reconsider.

415
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,627
I beg your pardon?

416
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,527
Asking us to leave.

417
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,142
You need to reconsider.

418
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,989
If you saw how it is
out there you wouldn't ask.

419
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,157
You're a man of belief.

420
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:16,672
If you believe anything,
believe that.

421
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:18,267
You're putting me
on the spot.

422
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:21,258
Well, I mean to.

423
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:23,866
Those people look to me
for answers.

424
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:26,116
I wish they didn't,
but they do.

425
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,029
But I'm not asking
for them or myself.

426
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:31,525
I'm asking for my boy.

427
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:34,258
After the price
your friend Otis paid,

428
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:36,107
the least you can do
is give it some thought.

429
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:38,766
You're a plainspoken man.

430
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:40,871
I'm a father.

431
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:44,349
He's the one thing
I don't want to fail.

432
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:48,204
I feel like I do every day.

433
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:53,943
I lied to him
this morning.

434
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:59,553
It wasn't a big lie,
but it was enough.

435
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:03,332
My father didn't bother
with comforting lies.

436
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,085
He used his fist.

437
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,172
He was a loveless,
violent drunk

438
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:10,138
and no good to anybody.

439
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:12,959
He drove me from home
when I was 15.

440
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:16,400
Didn't lay eyes on this place
again for many years.

441
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:19,245
I was not
at his deathbed, Rick.

442
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,099
I would not grant him that

443
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:24,131
and to this day
do not regret it.

444
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,604
Some men do not earn
the love of their sons.

445
00:32:34,524 --> 00:32:37,297
I don't see you
having that problem.

446
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,409
Will you consider
my request?

447
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,956
There are aspects
to this,

448
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,003
things that I can't
and won't discuss.

449
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,281
But if you and your people
respect my rules,

450
00:32:56,283 --> 00:33:00,085
no promises,
but I will consider it.

451
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:02,202
You have my word.

452
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:08,012
You have mine.

453
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:18,178
Hey.

454
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,692
I'll sit with him.

455
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,812
He was awake earlier
when you were gone.

456
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:31,756
He asked for you.

457
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:49,630
- I...
- Don't spoil it.

458
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:54,054
<i>So it was good.</i>

459
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:56,036
It was a one-time thing.

460
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,098
- Everything go okay?
- Fine.

461
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:08,523
Nothing happened.

462
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,542
Did you find it?

463
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,616
I cleaned up.

464
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,209
Wanted it to be
nice for her.

465
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,740
For a second I thought
I was in the wrong place.

466
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:10,690
A flower?

467
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,574
It's a cherokee rose.

468
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,924
The story is that
when American soldiers

469
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:25,112
were moving Indians off their
land on the trail of tears

470
00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:29,158
<i>the cherokee mothers were
grieving and crying so much</i>

471
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:31,560
<i>'cause they were losing their
little ones along the way</i>

472
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,288
from exposure and disease

473
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:37,483
and starvation.

474
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,168
A lot of them
just disappeared.

475
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:46,198
<i>So the elders,
they said a prayer;</i>

476
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:49,884
asked for a sign to uplift
the mothers' spirits,

477
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,943
give them strength

478
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,068
and hope.

479
00:35:58,399 --> 00:36:00,487
The next day this rose

480
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:03,305
started to grow right where
the mothers' tears fell.

481
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,639
I'm not fool enough

482
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:11,554
to think there's any flowers
blooming for my brother.

483
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:18,534
But I believe
this one

484
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:22,336
bloomed for
your little girl.

485
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:40,739
She's gonna really
like it in here.

486
00:36:58,129 --> 00:36:59,828
Hey, dad.

487
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,333
Hey.

488
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:13,227
Carl,

489
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:17,238
I told you something earlier
today about Sophia...

490
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,106
I know.
Mom told me.

491
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:25,373
Here I was getting ready
to confess.

492
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:30,936
I didn't mean to lie.
I just didn't want to worry you.

493
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:33,613
It's a stupid excuse

494
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,040
but it's all I got.

495
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:36,985
It's okay.

496
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,298
Do you think
we'll find her?

497
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,161
I know we will.

498
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,551
Well...

499
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,475
I don't know.

500
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:55,549
But I truly believe it.

501
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,311
You look tired.

502
00:37:58,313 --> 00:38:02,127
I am tired.

503
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:05,259
Hey, I'm like you now.

504
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:07,678
We've both been shot.

505
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,324
Isn't that weird?

506
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:14,513
Yeah, I think your mother would
rather hear we got the same eyes.

507
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:15,787
So let's keep that
between us.

508
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:22,045
Since you're in
the club now,

509
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:23,751
you get to wear the hat.

510
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,164
Didn't you know?

511
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:38,178
We'll pad the rim tomorrow
so it sits better.

512
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:40,695
Won't you miss it?

513
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:45,345
Maybe you'll let me borrow
it from time to time.

514
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:47,499
We can share it.

515
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,549
Okay.

516
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:51,263
Sleep now.

517
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:53,257
Okay.

518
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,602
I love you, dad.

519
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:58,842
I love you.

520
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:25,666
Are you putting them away?

521
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:46,144
Stay with him
a while longer.

522
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,518
I'll wait up.

523
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:36,657
