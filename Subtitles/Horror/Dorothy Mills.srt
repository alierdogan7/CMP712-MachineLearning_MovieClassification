from Your presence?

You're there.

8
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:32,689
Your Hand will guide me.

There is no place you can go,

10
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:39,131
no place you can be,

11
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,030
where you are not in the presence

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,797
of the Lord our God.

13
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,430
There is no thought
you can have,

14
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,007
no dream
you can dream,

15
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:53,771
where the Lord our God
does not see.

If I go up to the heavens,

17
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,748
You are there.

Your hand will guide me.

22

If I make my bed in the depths,

23
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:22,231
You are there.

Absolutely normal.

00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,533
Can I have a cigarette?

00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,220
Things are still very...

There's no rush.

You take all the time you want.

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,934
Where should I begin?

45
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,906
You wanted this case.

46
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,241
You knew how difficult it would be.

47
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,310
But you still wanted it.

48
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,953
You insisted.

49
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,587
I wanted to go.

50
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,130
I needed to.

51
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,065
I had to get away
before the city smothered me.

You come with me.

We'll get you dried off.

91

Here it is. Isn't a suite,
but I hope you'll be comfortable.

92
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,616
I'll maybe get you another blanket.

93

It's been cold these last few nights.

94
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,754
The heating's been on all day,

95
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,090
so there should be
plenty of hot water.

96
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,164
This is the bathroom.

97
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,701
Should I run a bath for you?

98
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,014

How long will it take to fix this?

115
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,263
It's scrap.

116

Even if we could get the parts,

117
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,107
it would cost more
than the car's worth.

- How safe was your BMW?

as much as for your sake
as for Dorothy's.

125
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,902
You're already making excuses for her?

126
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,767
I'm trying to find out the truth.

127
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,137
The truth?

128
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,199
The truth is...

129
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,269
you'll find some name for her condition,

130
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,745
and in another couple of years,

131
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,214
she'll be out there abusing
someone else's child,

132
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,344
maybe even her own.

133
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,752
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

134
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,220
That was the first time
we used Dorothy as a babysitter.

135
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,924
I had my doubts,
but the pastor said she was all right.

It's an emergency. Please!

151
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,408
In this case, we'll make an exception.

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,277

Hello, Dorothy.

158
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,579
I'm Dr. Morton,

159
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,749
but you can call me Jane.

160
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,194
You were expecting me, weren't you?

161
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,118
You're very gifted.

162
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,163
Dorothy, we need to talk.

163
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,323
Can I sit here?

164
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,574
You know why I'm here, don't you?

165
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,941
Look, all I want is to listen to you.

166
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,112
I'm not here to judge you,
and I won't make any decisions.

167
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,597
Do you like babies?

168
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,968
What baby?

169
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,605
There was no baby.
I wasn't even there.

170
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,650
I don't want to speak anymore.

171
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,889
Nobody listens to me.

172
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,618
Nobody.

173
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,594
I'm listening.

174
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,801
And I'll understand you.

175
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,928
Dorothy.

176
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,939
Trust me.

177
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,515
So where were you if you
weren't at the Kearsleys'?

178
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,721
I said my prayers,

179
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,848
and I went to bed.

180
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,227
And I woke up in the morning

181
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,663
in my bed.

182
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,828
Do you remember anything else?

183
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,204
I'm sick of all your questions.

184
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,373
Okay.

185
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,577
Well, why don't we just
swap places, then?

186

You think she's guilty, don't you?

190
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,838
I'm just doing the first psychological
assessment in this case.

191
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,169
Case?

192
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,301
This case is a child.

193
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,742
And she has suffered enough.

194
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,404
It's up to the court
to decide what happens.

195
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,506
I promise I'll do what's best for her.

So you're the doctor, too?

205
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,931
I am.

206
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,470
How long have you
been looking after Dorothy?

207
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,632
Not since she was 13.

208
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,260
Healthy child, isn't she?

209
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:15,026
Here on the island,
we live a clean, healthy life.

210
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,898
Our faith shelters us.

211
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,029
I suppose you just failed to notice
her mental illness?

212
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,542
Dorothy is a special child.

213
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,975
There is a place for her
in our community.

214
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,945
Even if she did molest that baby?

215
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,141
It is the Lord's place to judge, not mine.

216
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,649
I'm not here to judge her, either.

217
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,379
I'm here to help her.

218
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,613
And she can be helped.

219
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,824
We have little faith in your science.

220
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,488
How can your science
fathom her pure soul?

221
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,499
One of God's angels.

222
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,162
An angel that might end up in prison.

223
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,881
They're not really fond
of women in here, are they?

224
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,981
It's a very devout community.

225
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,958
They take their faith very seriously.

226

You're not a believer?

227

Hmm. And raised.

231
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,637
Tried to escape the place,
but this island is like a magnet.

232
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,070
You can't escape.

233
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,268
There you are.

I saw Dorothy today.

238
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,662
Yeah? How'd it go?

239
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,893
I think she's scared to death.

240
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,299
- Scared of who?
- Don't know.

241
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,530
Herself, maybe.

242
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,132
Self-loathing can be a powerful driver.

243
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,075
Don't stare at her too long there, John.

244

When my sister died,

there was no one else to look after her.

309
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,720
So it was natural she stay with me.

310

What about Dorothy's father?

311
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,797
We never knew him.

312
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,928
Mabel wasn't promiscuous,
you understand?

313
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,972
She was fanciful,

314
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,028
flighty.

315
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,890
She wasn't simple, either,
no matter what the others say.

She just couldn't seem
to hold down a job

317
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,624
until she took the job
in the funeral parlor,

318

319
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,456
She liked that.

320
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,002
But she was a good mother.

321
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,333
And she kept Dorothy safe
from the other children.

322
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,374
Do you have any idea why she was
bullied by the other children?

323
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,274
Because they hated
anyone or anything

324
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,834
that was different.

325
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,848
God help the child.
She was always different.

326
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,544
Did you ever think
she might be dangerous?

327
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,815
She never laid a hand on that baby.

328
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,287
She swore to me she didn't,

00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,754
Why do you want to help me?

331
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,492
Because I've heard
you talk and...

I'd just fly.

00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:01,091
But know that it
laps on every shore.

369
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,498
The Lord sees all and knows all...

370
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,696
the righteous and the sinner,

371
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,604
the guilty and the blameless.

372
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,072
Morning.

373
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,476
We had an appointment.
Do you remember?

374
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,607
I'm sorry.

375
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,810
I had to take Dorothy

376
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,046
to the police station to sign the register.

377
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,645
She's ready for you now.

378
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,323
Hi, Dorothy.

379
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,261
Do you want to come for a walk with me?

380
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,092
I'll take you back to your aunt afterwards.

381
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,207
I want to stay with my auntie.

382
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,299
Come on, child.

383
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,941
Come out.

384
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,107
Do as you're told, child.

385
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,879
That's a girl.

386
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,640
Your aunt is really nice
with you, isn't she?

387
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,142
[child-like voice]
Yes, she is.

388
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,647
She's looking after me
until Mommy comes back.

389
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,410
Where is your mommy?

390
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,009
She's out on the sea, sailing.

391
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,180
She'll soon be back
to pick up her little Mimi

392
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:35,657
and give her a pretty dress.

393
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,489
M-Mimi?

394
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,325
How old are you?

395
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,330
3.

396
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,335
Ain't she gorgeous?

397
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,238
So if you are Mimi,

398
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,281
where has Dorothy gone?

399
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,179
She hasn't gone.

400
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,444
She's asleep.

401
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,542
Asleep?

402
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,018
Yes.

403
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,715
In here. Right inside.

404
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,552
Dorothy is asleep inside of you?

405
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,224
You know what?

406
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,991
When her mother died,

407
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,532
I had to go to the funeral

408
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,125
because Dorothy was sleeping.

409
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,102
They don't let her out much.

410
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,229
Who doesn't let her out?

411
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,671
The others.

412
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,765
Who are they?

413
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,104
I'm not allowed to tell.

414
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,771
Why don't they let her out?

415
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,942
Because she always
tries to kill herself.

416
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,212
Do you think my hair is pretty?

417
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,318

418

Do you like it?

419
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,420
It's a gift. You can keep it on.

420

- Shut your mouth, you little bitch!

Mommy, where are you?

Mommy, help me.

441
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,332
Help me.

442
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,068
Shh.

443
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,871
Shh. It's over.

444
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,570
I'm here with you, baby.

How dare you!

446
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,148
You should be ashamed of yourself.

447
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,277
Come on, pet.

448
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,621
I would appreciate it
if you didn't interfere during the sessions.

449

Come on, darlin'.

450
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,689
Go on now.

It's me, Jane.

455
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,845
Yeah. Great.

456
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,888
Well, it's a very interesting case.

457
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,584
I think I just might have to stay...

459
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,590
Hello?

460
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,829
Shit.

Oh. You scared me.

463
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,641
Sorry.

464
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,473
It's difficult to call
the mainland from the island.

You going back to the village?

466

Want to try again?

Well, I see Dorothy.

Fuckin' weird, huh?

480
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,292
So where's Mimi?

taking the hangover after I get drunk.

486
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,720
Is that what happened, Mary?

487
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,349
You hurt the baby and let Dorothy face
the consequences?

488
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,791
I didn't lay a finger on that brat!

489
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,454
But if she goes to jail for it,
there's no more drinking for you.

You're a stranger here.

Stick your nose in too far,

493
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,262

She let the devil into her house.

554
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,611
[All]
Our Father...

555
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,080
- [Pastor] Our King of glory...
- Our King of glories...

556
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,607
- We ask the Lord Jesus...
- We ask the Lord Jesus...

557
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,677
[Pastor]
To bear your servant Dorothy...

558
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,620
To bear your servant Dorothy...

559
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,954
Once more into the realm of the dead.

560
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,256
Once more into the realm of the dead.

561
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,664
- [Dorothy wailing]
- Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ,

562
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,035
- our Father, our King...
- I beg you.

563
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,131
Please let him talk to me.

564
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,041
Please let him find the peace to talk.

565
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,100
[Dorothy]
Leave her alone!

566
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,841
Through the blackness of eternity...

567
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:15,009
Fuck all of you pigs!

568
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,576
- [Dorothy screaming, crying]
- [group chanting]

569
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,588
Please stop!

570
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,248
[screams]

571
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,758
It hurts!

572
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,590
[continues crying]

573
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,257
[screaming]

574
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:34,066
Let her go
before I fucking kill you!

575
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,367
Please don't!

576
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,374
Leave her alone!

577
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,569
For God's sake.

578
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,603
[Dorothy crying]
Please don't. Please.

579
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,615
I shall notify the court in the morning

580
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,880
that Dorothy must be taken
into custody immediately.

581
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:50,977
She's not safe with you.

582
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,352
I'm taking her with me.

583
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,801
[no audible dialogue]

584
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,265
Aah!

585
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,741
You bitch! Bitch!

586
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,038
All right, Dorothy, calm down.

587
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,842
Oh, hey, it's the fucking sheriff!

588
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,017
[screaming]

589
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,019
I asked you not to intervene.

590
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,180
Well, next time, I'll tie her up.

591
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,156
My head.

592
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,965
Well, you were kind of asking for it.

593
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,303
Dorothy?

594
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,605
I'm not Dorothy.

595
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:48,803
I'm Kurt.

596
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,238
Well, nice to meet you, Kurt.

597
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,407
I'm Jane.

598
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,311
Tell me what I can do to help you.

599
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,356
I always take the pain for her.

600
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,016
For Dorothy.

601
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,028
I take the pain so she doesn't get hurt.

602
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,529
She wouldn't handle it.

603
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,326
That's very brave of you.

604
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,390
Yeah, well, I'm getting
a bit bored with it now.

605
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,992
And I don't want to go to jail.

606
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,197
If Dorothy goes to jail,
we'll all go, won't we?

607
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:18,002
Yes.

608
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,407
But you have to help me.

609
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,037
Were you there at the Kearsleys'?

610
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,910
- Did you see the baby?
- No, no.

611
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,439
I can't talk. Duncan won't let me.

612
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,679
- Who's Duncan?
- Duncan's the boss.

613
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,085
Where is he? Can I talk to him?

614
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,680
Trust me, you don't want
anything to do with him.

615
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,350
You, especially. He'd kill you.

616
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,950
Tell Duncan that I want to speak to...

617
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,223
[whimpering]

618
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,663
Come back here, bastard!

619
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,666
Bastard! Shut it!

620
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,998
[wailing]
Hold her down for me.

621
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,504
[continues wailing]

622
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,006
Dorothy.

623
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,200
[screaming]

624
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,436
[crying]
No.

625
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,540
I killed the baby, didn't I?

626
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,344
Tell me. Tell me, please.

627
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,351
- Dorothy?
- What are you doing? No.

628
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,545
- I promise...
- Stop it.

629
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,589
- I promise it won't hurt.
- Stop it!

630
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,647
We should take her home.

631
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,321
I gave her a tranquilizer.

632
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,559
She'll sleep until tomorrow morning.

633
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,608
I'll be here before she wakes up.

634
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,793
You were very impressive back there.

635
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,332
Thanks.

636
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,960
But you should've got
that ferry this morning.

637
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,129
You know, people
are getting nervous around here.

638
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,172
You're unsettling them.

639
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,797
I'm unsettling them?

640
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,739
You've had time to gather
your material, you know?

641
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,869
You can write
your report now, can't you?

642
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,744
Well, maybe there's more
at stake than just a report.

643
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,180
Look, I've a small boat.

644
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,844
I could easily take you to the mainland.

645
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,115
I can't leave without Dorothy.

646
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,248
Well, the next ferry isn't for three days.

647
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,953
Well, then, I'll just have to wait for it.

648
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,326
See you later.

649
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,659
Jakey.

650
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,497
Hey, gorgeous.

651
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,006
Want to party?

652
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,666
Dorothy, you shouldn't be out here...

653
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,731
Shut up.

654
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,975
You drive.

655
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,986
Come on.

656
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,567
Come on.

657
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,805
Come on.

658
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,607
Come on. Come on.

659
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,988
You really think
I was gonna let a pinhead like you

660
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,614
jerk off inside me?

661
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,819
You're a funny boy, Jakey, aren't you?

662
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,384
Can't resist.

663
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,660
I'm desperate,
but I'm not that desperate.

664
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,702
[laughing]

665
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,865
You twisted slut. I'll fucking kill you!

666
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,638
You slag!

667
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,613
You fucking dirt box!

668
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,843
[groaning]

669
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,757
[crying]

670
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,579
[phone rings]

671
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,117
[ring]

672
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:43,025
[ring]

673
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:48,034
[ring]

674
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,131
[ring]

675
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,800
Hello?

676
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,139
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Dr. Norton?</i>

677
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,645
Yes, it's me. Who's speaking?

678
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,648
<i>Dorothy tried to kill herself.</i>

679
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,047
Who is this?

680
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,984
<i>Dorothy needs you. Come quickly.</i>

681
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,103
Dorothy!

682
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,264
Why, you must be freezing.

683
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,933
I'm not Dorothy. I'm Kurt.

684
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,204
What happened, Kurt?

685
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,075
When you put Dorothy to bed,

686
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:34,014
Mary took over
and escaped out the window.

687
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,108
What did she do?

688
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,313
The usual tricks.

689
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,117
She got arsed with some bloke,

690
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,648
and then vanished
when things got out of hand.

691
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:48,060
Dorothy was so close
to throwing herself off that cliff.

692
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,258
If I hadn't been there to save her...

693
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,960
Good man, Kurt.

694
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,094
Dorothy will be very proud of you.

695
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,974
Oh, sweetheart, I'm here.
It's all right now.

696
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,840
I'm taking you home.

697
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,902
What sort of drug did you give her?

698
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,096
[whimpering]

699
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,197
I'm not dead?

700
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,234
I'm not dead!

701
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,066
No, no, you're not dead.

702
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,130
But I saw the cliff.

703
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,573
I remember the cliff.

704
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,668
I fell off the cliff. I saw the waves.

705
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,337
Shh. You're safe now. It's okay.

706
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,540
No, but I'm a freak.

707
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,276
Nobody can help a freak!

708
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,681
You're not a freak, Dorothy, okay?

709
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,243
I've done horrible things
I don't even remember.

710
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,586
I'm so ashamed.

711
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,888
I'm so ashamed.

712
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,952
Listen, Dorothy. Listen carefully to me.

713
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:32,525
The things that are happening inside of you
are not your fault.

714
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,967
These blackouts that you have,

715
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,369
they're caused
by different characters

716
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:40,671
that you've created in your mind.

717
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,768
And when you're scared,
just like now,

718
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:46,246
your... your mind sends out
a character to protect you.

719
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,012
But I don't remember anything.

720
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,686
No, but it's because...

721
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,382
it's because you...

722
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,288
- Dorothy.
- No.

723
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,157
It's because...

724
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:02,163
you disappear when that happens.

725
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,099
Dorothy...

726
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:07,594
they're inside of you.

727
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,969
No. No.

728
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,668
Dorothy, they're trying to keep you

729
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,540
- from killing yourself.
- It isn't true.

730
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,080
Dorothy, it was one of these characters

731
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,547
that hurt this baby, Dorothy, not you.

732
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,482
You mustn't be afraid of them.

733
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,645
Listen, you must try
to relate to them.

734
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,617
[masculine voice]
Get your hand off me.

735
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,685
Didn't I already tell you to piss off?

736
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,323
Duncan, is that you?

737
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:37,832
Did you hurt the baby?

738
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,390
Do you think I hurt the baby?

739
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,905
- Why did you do it?
- How can I do anything?

740
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,405
I'm just a character.

741
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,998
Why did you do it?

742
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,474
Payback.

743
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,170
Just a little bit of payback.

744
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,009
What could a baby
have done against you?

745
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:55,346
You think you're
so fucking smart, don't you?

746
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,854
You don't know anything.

747
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,151
[chuckles]

748
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:04,785
Why don't you take a look
at Dorothy's latest drawing?

749
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,955
She did it just for you!

750
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:19,231
Isn't that sweet little David,

751
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,175
floating and dead

752
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:26,011
like a rotten old fish?

753
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,480
[child-like voice]
Mommy, Mommy, the water is so cold.

754
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:38,755
- Stop it.
- I don't want to die.

755
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:41,490
Stop it. Stop it!

756
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:46,467
Don't shout at me, Mommy.
I'm drowning. Help me.

757
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,336
Help me. Why did you leave me?

758
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,306
Don't let me drown.

759
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,177
Mommy, help me.

760
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,682
Why did you leave me?

761
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,582
Don't let me drown.

762
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,554
Please, the water is so cold.

763
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:09,750
The water is so cold.

764
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:13,353
I don't want to die.

765
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,670

767
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:00,926
Please forgive me.

768
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,165
It was my fault.

769
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,577
I thought it was safe.

770
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,782
Please forgive me.

## [guitar continues]

775
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:16,371
Who is the boy in this photograph?

776
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:18,566
That's my grandson.

777
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:22,041
He's the boy that drove me into the lake,

778
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,408
him and two other kids.

779
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,676
Oh, no. It couldn't be him.

780
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:29,741
He's dead this ten years.

781
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,621
He was good on the guitar.

782
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:37,352
[strums guitar]

783
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,362
What was his name?

784
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,190
Duncan.

785
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:56,871
How did he die?

786
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,312
Such a stupid thing.

787
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:04,342
They crashed their car into the lake.

788
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,614
They?

789
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,146
Duncan and his two young friends,

790
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,193
Mary and Kurt.

791
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:16,932
No, that's impossible.

792
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,728
I saw them in the car in front of me.

793
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,996
I've seen them in the square.

794
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,561
If you don't believe me,
check the records.

795
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,577
##

796
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,908
You must have told her
about your son.

797
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:45,147
You're the only one
I've mentioned it to.

798
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:47,416
And I didn't even
tell you how he died.

799
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,685
You've obviously been going
through too much strain.

800
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,350
Look, you're exhausted,
and your imagination's

801
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,689
beginning to play tricks on you.

802
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,456
Tricks?

803
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,623
You don't have the slightest idea.

804
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:59,065
These characters
inside of her head are dead.

805
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,864
They're dead!

806
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:05,066
And these kids that drove me
into the lake, they're dead, too.

807
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,904
And they're the ones
that are turning poor Dorothy

808
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,069
into a fucking ventriloquist!

809
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,737
One time she's Mimi,
then she's Kurt,

810
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,405
then she's Duncan, then she's Mary.

811
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,176
I've heard them
all speak through her,

812
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,013
and there's not a fucking thing
she can do about it.

813
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,177
How can you believe that?

814
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,118
You're the psychiatrist, for fuck's sake.

815
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:22,123
Colin, some evil shit is going on.

816
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:25,752
I swear, she feels people's pain.

817
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:29,491
I mean, I even heard
my own dead son speak.

818
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,192
Jane. Jane, Jane, Jane.

819
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:35,897
Shh.

820
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,074
- [sniffling]
- Hush.

821
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:50,776
Jane, you have
to get away from here.

822
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,445
I'm gonna take you
to the mainland tomorrow...

823
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,547
- No.
- No, listen.

824
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,525
I don't like the way people are acting.

825
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:03,259
I don't think you're safe here.

826
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,233
What is their real problem
with Dorothy?

827
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:10,568
What are they so fucking scared of?

828
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:14,632
It's old stuff, okay? Local stuff.

829
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:18,441
It's like you've lifted a stone
and exposed something.

830
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,747
I can't believe it's Dorothy.

831
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,355
[pills rattling]

832
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:34,453

These'll help you
get through the night.

834
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:41,729
You can sleep here.

835
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,465
I'll wake you
first thing in the morning.

836
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,439
Trust me.

837
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,600
We'll make decisions in the morning.

838
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:48,938
Okay.

Oh.

851
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,577
I'm going to take Dorothy
back with me to the hospital.

852
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,238
With the right treatment there,

853
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,214
I'm confident we can help her.

01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:21,286
[weeping]

855
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,949
It's for her own good, Mrs. McMahon.

856
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,359
If I can prove this is a case
of multiple personality,

857
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,021
there's a good chance she'll be acquitted.

858
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:32,396
You want to keep her gift
all to yourself, don't you?

859
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,562
I couldn't bear to lose
my Mary all over again.

860
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,971
We're talking about
Dorothy, Mrs. McMahon.

861
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,773
Well, my little Mary died 10 years ago.

862
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:47,247
I thought I'd never see her again.

863
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,980
But the good Lord brought Dorothy
into my home as a gift.

864
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,614
She's worked miracles for me.

865
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:11,168
She's made your son
speak, hasn't she?

866
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,172
David.

867
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,436
That's his name, isn't it?

868
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,237
Isn't it?

869
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,045
We have to think about Dorothy.

870
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:23,914
We have to help her.

871
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,421

You've gotta get away from here.

874
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,517
I've seen death
cast its wings on you.

875
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,900
What is it, Dorothy?

876
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,608
Is it the water?

877
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,707
- And the blood?
- I'm scared.

878
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,747
I don't want to remember.

879
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,753
I'm scared.

It's okay.

881
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,931
You've gone through it once.

882
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,796
And you can live it
again through memory.

883
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:52,103
I want to take you
back in time, Dorothy.

884
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,665
I'll count from 10 to 1.

Where are you?

896
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,435
There was an accident.

01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,412
My mother is washing

- Yes.

Look, Dorothy. Aren't they beautiful now?

901
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,022
They've a long journey ahead of them,

902
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,827
to the realm of the dead.

903
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,162
Shall we say good-bye to them?

No...

Don't be scared, Dorothy.

Look. It's your cousin Mary.

907
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:01,470
Give her a kiss good-bye.

- Give her a kiss.

No!

910
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,206
Dorothy, give her a kiss good-bye.

It's over now. Dorothy. Shh.

915
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,275
- [sniffles]
- Shh.

916
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:42,680
You didn't kiss the dead bodies.

917
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,447
Your mind created Mimi
as a tiny little girl

918
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,284
who doesn't have
the slightest idea about death.

919
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,655
She kissed the dead for you.

920
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,321
Yeah.

921
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,830
It's all over now.

922
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,857
Shh. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

923
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,928
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

924
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,836
Shh.

925
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,152
[approaching footsteps]

926
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:05,924
[door buzzer]

927
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,110
Evening, Colin.

928
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,668
Remember me?

929
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,441
[shuddering breaths]

930
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,315
- No...
- You weren't so scared

931
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:26,615
when you were with your three mates.

932
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:28,878
No.

933
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,652
You're not real.

934
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,354
Don't pretend you've forgotten,
you fucking piece of shit!

935
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:35,987
You're dead.

936
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,292
Mary's dead. You're all dead.

937
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:38,354
We're back.

938
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,924
We've been waiting for you.

939
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,163
Time for payback...

940
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,672
Sheriff.

941
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,708
[gunshot]

942
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:57,545
[people shouting in distance]

943
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:07,053
[shouting continues]

944
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:10,424
You tell us who's next!

945
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:11,465
It's up to you.

946
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,932
There's a man lying dead in the hall.

947
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,525
You tell us who's next.

948
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,037
[voices echo, vanish]

949
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,630
[no audible dialogue]

950
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,792
[faint yelling]

951
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,456
[Man]
Don't you tell us what to do!

952
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,090
[Pastor]
Quiet, every one of you!

953
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:52,732
Dorothy, tell me what happened.

954
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,207
[crying]
I don't know. I don't know.

955
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:57,404
When I woke up, he was dead.

956
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,673
[Kearsley]
She's got to be stopped.

957
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,738
Before she comes after all of us!

958
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,009
[crowd murmurs]

959
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,677
Can't you see he killed himself?

960
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,380
Dorothy's not the problem.

961
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:08,752
It's you! It's all of you!

962
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:10,757
She knows the truth
about your community.

963
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,554
Dorothy is a lunatic,
just like her mother,

964
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:13,651
and you know that.

965
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,889
Dorothy's a member of our community.

966
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,125
It's our responsibility to deal with her.

967
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,563
My name is Duncan McLellan.

968
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,967
Oh, Duncan.

969
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:29,510
My dear Duncan...

970
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:32,068
I was a member
of your community, too.

971
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,420
We're listening, Duncan.

972
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:46,050
I'll show you.

973
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,333
[thunder]

974
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,666
[Jane]
Tell us, Duncan.

975
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,797
Why did you hurt
the Kearsleys' baby?

976
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,744
[Duncan]
His father had to pay.

977
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,221
They all had to pay
for what they did to Mary!

978
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,383
- <i>## [rock]</i>
- <i>[whooping, shouting]</i>

979
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:53,222
Yeah! Come on, Mary!

980
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:56,058
[whooping continues]

981
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,874
<i>## [Irish folk]</i>

982
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,851
Whoo!

983
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:22,287
Get the fuck away!

984
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,348
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

985
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:25,859
Whoo!

986
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:29,762
Why don't you give us a dance?

987
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,265
Just piss off, would you?

988
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,698
Slapper!

989
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,363
Duncan?

990
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:38,872
Kurt!

991
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,464
[whistling]

992
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,067
Why the fuck are
youse hiding from me?

993
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:45,510
Keeping all the booze
to yourselves, is it?

994
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,042
Lads!

995
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,014
Fuck it.

996
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,958
- Hey! Come back and dance.
- Fuck off!

997
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,962
Better watch your language, you slut.

998
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,224
Yeah, be polite to me friend.

999
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,391
- Hey! Let go of me, will you?
- [men laughing]

1000
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,264
Get the fuck off me!

1001
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,030
Get the fuck off me!

1002

1003
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:14,039
Duncan! Duncan!

1004
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:22,683
[muffled crying]

1005
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,756
[muffled crying, screaming]

1006
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,967
[roars]

1007
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:48,631
Leave her alone!

1008
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:52,073
Jesus!

1009
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,809
Let her go! Or I swear I'll kill him!

1010
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:56,646
Let her go, lads! Let her go!

1011
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,817
Back off! Back off!

1012
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,257
I'll cut his throat.

1013
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:07,055
Fucking shag this!

1014
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:08,527
[screams]

1015
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:15,168
[engine roars]

1016
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:19,095
I'll fucking kill him for that!

1017
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,539
This is getting out of hand, lad.

1018
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:22,542
He tried to kill you.
Are you with us or not?

1019
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:34,821
[crying]

1020
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:37,380
It's okay! It's over now!

1021
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,756
They're riding our backside!

1022
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,727
Hurry up!

1023
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,897
Faster! Speed it up, man!

1024
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,163
- [horn honking]
- Try the fucking gas!

1025
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:53,400
- [horn continues]
- Faster!

1026
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,771
- I can't go faster!
- [car slamming, honking]

1027
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:56,537
Hurry! Just step on it!

1028
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:58,238
Step on it!

1029
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,345
[crying]
Oh, God.

1030
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,475
Hurry up!
They're gonna kill us!

1031
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,397
[tires squealing]

1032
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:24,765
[gasps]

1033
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:10,573
[Mrs. McMahon]
You...

1034
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:13,519
You killed my daughter.

1035
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,988
You killed my daughter!

1036
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:18,184
Kurt. My Kurt.

1037
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,318
We were just young and stupid!

1038
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:21,657
We didn't mean...

1039
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,828
Forgive us, Duncan, please!

1040
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,700
Duncan!

1041
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:29,498
[thunder rumbles]

1042
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,299
[soft moaning]

1043
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,612
- You bastard.
- Get away from me.

1044
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,977
Stay away!

1045
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:41,037
Stay away!

1046
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,951
Mary McMahon was up for it!

1047
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,860
Oh...

1048
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:58,456
you bunch of hypocrites.

1049
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,967
You didn't bat an eye
when we took her away, did you?

1050
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,024
Hmm?

1051
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,805
You all thought she deserved it.

1052
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,033
Didn't you!

1053
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:11,875
We're all in this together.

1054
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,345
Together.

1055
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,446
We can keep this on the island.

1056
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,948
- She's the only evidence.
- Dorothy!

1057
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,289
Please! Please, don't touch her!

1058
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,352
You leave her alone! Please!

1059
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,954
- Hush, woman!
- Don't touch her!

1060
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,727
Think about it now.

1061
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,260
Huh? Do you really want
all the publicity?

1062
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,600
Hmm?

1063
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,937
Policemen?

1064
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,202
Journalists?

1065
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:43,766
Huh?

1066
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:47,576
All poking their noses
all around this island?

1067
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,513
Our island?

1068
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:56,315
It'll be the end
of your happy little community.

1069
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:05,296
Huh? Think about that now.

1070
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:15,103
She's the only evidence.

1071
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:19,870
You leave her alone!

1072
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,107
[roaring]

1073
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,811
[Pastor]
This is a time of tribulation.

1074
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,441
Fear and anger

1075
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:33,078
threaten to drive apart
those who have lived in fellowship

1076
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,213
for many, many years.

1077
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,984
We cannot let this pass.

1078
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:45,562
For the sake
of the island, we must act.

1079
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:48,033
We must right this wrong.

1080
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:51,162
[sobbing]

1081
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:55,399
We will not hand you to the police.

1082
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:59,638
But you cannot stay here.

1083
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:02,842
You will be exiled
from this place forever,

1084
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,908
you and your families.

1085
01:32:05,987 --> 01:32:08,717
Your homes will be leveled.

1086
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,587
All memory of you will be erased.

1087
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:18,223
If any man should disagree with this,

1088
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,130
let him speak now.

1089
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:30,907
We have all sinned.

1090
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:34,311
And we shall all suffer.

1091
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,182
So let us now devote ourself

1092
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:41,278
to the worship of the Lord our God,

1093
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:45,689
in the hope of redeeming
ourselves in His eyes.

1094
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:51,592
As for the psychiatrist,

1095
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,861
it was her own stubbornness

1096
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:56,995
and refusal to listen to reason

1097
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,472
which brought her to tragedy.

1098
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:03,408
Suffice to say

1099
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:08,107
she left us without word
of her destination.

1100
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:59,431
No.
[gasps]

1101
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,594
No. It's not possible.

1102
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,238
I'm dead?

1103
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,467
I'm so sorry, Jane.

1104
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:12,176
It's all my fault.

1105
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:14,407
I should've stopped you
from going on that damned island.

1106
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,471
I feel so guilty.

1107
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:17,210
Don't say that.
[sniffles]

1108
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:20,445
I'm happy you sent me.

1109
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:25,788
I couldn't save David, you see.

1110
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,452
But at least I saved Dorothy.

1111
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:29,291
[sniffles]

1112
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,331
I saved her, didn't I?

1113
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:34,596
You saved her.

1114
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:37,799
You brought her back to me.

1115
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:41,398
She'll be acquitted,

1116
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:44,444
and she'll stay here
until she's cured.

1117
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:49,239
Yeah.

1118
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,817
And now it's up to you, Jane.

1119
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:59,619
You have to leave Dorothy's body.

1120
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,219
She won't be free until you're gone.

1121
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,764
Will you take good care of her?

1122
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,537
I promise.

1123
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:32,617
Keep it.
[sniffles]

1124
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:34,684
David loved you so much.

1125
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,556
I'll keep it forever.

1126
01:35:43,537 --> 01:35:47,268
Good-bye, my love.

1127
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:51,904
[exhales]

1128
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:01,313
[beeping]

1129
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:19,933
Dorothy?

1130
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,004
Is that you?

1131
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:37,452
[Dorothy]
Has Jane been crying?

1132
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,220
She was here.

1133
01:36:42,363 --> 01:36:44,092
She's gone now.

1134
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:52,168
She's with her son... David.

1135
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,806
Do you think they're all gone?

1136
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:01,981
Duncan and Kurt

1137
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,812
and Mary?

1138
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:06,182
And Mimi, too?

1139
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:09,347
You have to learn to live
on your own now, Dorothy.

1140
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:24,637
You're free.
