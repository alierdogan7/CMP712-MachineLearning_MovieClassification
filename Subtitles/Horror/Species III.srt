00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,749
It's a girl.

187
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,788
Yes, l...

188
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,313
We decided to make it female

189
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,859
so it would be more
docile and controllable.

190
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,259
More docile and
controllable, huh?

191
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,059
I guess you guys
don't get out much.

192
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,865
That's her one month
after she was born.

193
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,462
So you kept her
caged...in there.

194
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,067
We decided it would be safer
to keep her in isolation.

195
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,608
She didn't like
being locked up like that.

196
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,375
She didn't like
being alone.

197
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,812
Didn't she?

198
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,486
She's hiding something,

199
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,580
something inside.

You're right, Dan.

201
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,925
This is three months
after she was born,

202
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,484

203
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,359

She's having
horrible nightmares.

210
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,909
It's some kind
of anxiety reaction.

211
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,507
Got me a little anxious.

212
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,486
It made the research team
a little anxious, too,

213
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,886
so the decision was made

214
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,479
to terminate the experiment,

215
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,889
to run more research

216
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,416
so that we could determine
what we were dealing with.

217

You were going to gas her?

218
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,567
That was the decision.

of a transient was found

She's a predator.

Her eyes are in front.

233

Her eyes are in front

234
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,468
so she can judge the distance
to her prey.

235
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,844
That's right.

236
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,542
Where did you learn that fact?

237
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,484
I saw it on a documentary

238
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,883

Well, I think so.

247

00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,929
Do you have
a replacement camera?

369
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,364
We have
a standby camera,

370
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,594
but it'll take time
for the technician to replace it.

371
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,159
This happens all the time.

372
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,637
It's a simple operation
to replace it.

373
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,504
Are you saying
you can do it?

374
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,974
Well, yeah,
sure, I can.

375
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,273
I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

376
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,371
I don't want technicians in there.
This is classified.

377
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,972
I'll do it.

378
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,541
I'll do it.

379
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,348
A man of action.
I like that.

380
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,513
That's me.

381
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,432
Can you get that one
for me?

382
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,452
All right.
Give me the camera.

383
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,737
Something's--
Something's wrong.

384
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,245
Christ,
it's started already.

385
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,546
It's started already.
Get the top back on.

386
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:08,778
What?

387
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,578
Get the top back on.

388
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,422
Here you go.

389
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,717
Must have
penetrated the cell

390
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,524
before the camera went down.

391
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:19,722
What was that?

392
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,128
He dropped the bolt.

393
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,398
Find the bolt.
Get the top back on.

394
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,495
I'm looking, Fitch.

395
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,369
Can they hear me in there?

396
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,499
Laura, Press,
get the top back on.

397
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,044
Then I'm going
to let you out.

398
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,580
I think it fell
through the grate.

399
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,812
Can you lift up the grate?

400
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,783
It's not
going to work.

401
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,320
This isn't
going anywhere.

402
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,484
Press, you got
to get the bolt out

403
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,083
from under the grate.

404
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,823
Can't get to it.
The floor's welded down.

405
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,588
Oh, my God. Press...

406
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,189
Oh, my God!

407
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,428
I've never seen
anything like this.

408
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,460
I can't let them
out of the room.

409
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,470
Press, look.

410
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,506
Come on.

411
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,474
Fitch, let us
out of here!

412
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,602
Open the goddamn door!

413
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,079
Can't let you out till
I know what's in there.

414
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,776
You got to let them out.

415
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,078
Open the fuckin' door!

416
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,312
Let us out!

417
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,617
Tell me it's going to
stop growing, Dan.

418
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,088
Let them out!

419
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,620
Open up the door!

420
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,595
Press! Press!

421
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,792
What the fuck is that?

422
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,358
Laura, get to the other door!

423
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,562
Let her out, Fitch!

424
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,606
Can't let her out, Press.
I can't do that.

425
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,640
You motherfucker!

426
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,504
What's wrong with you?

427
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,237
I can't hold it.
It's breaking out.

428
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,676
Let her out, Fitch!

429
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,807
I'm going to burn it!
Get out of the way!

430
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,783
What is this thing?

431
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,151
If you can't destroy it,
I'll burn the room.

432
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,122
I have to burn
the whole room.

433
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,148
You got two minutes
to kill the thing.

434
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,693
Disconnect the gas line.

435
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,251
Use it as a flamethrower.

436
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,426
Past the table!
It's under the table!

437
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,730
Aah!

438
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,532
Laura, watch out!

439
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,838
Where did it go?

440
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,465
It's in the pipe.

441
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,136
Open the door!

442
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,838
Shut up, Dan!

443
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,215
One minute remaining.

444
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,458
Laura, it stopped moving.

445
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,521
Think I killed it.

446
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,131
It's dead. Open the door.

447
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,466
It's dead, Fitch.
Let them out.

448
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,832
Oh, God.

449
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,707
It's not dead.

450
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,947
It's not dead.

451
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,313
What are we
going to do?

452
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,513
30 seconds remaining.

453
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,215
There's not much time.

454
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,757
Open the door!

455
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,793
You got to
let them out.

456
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,385
It might escape.
I have to follow protocol.

457
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,896
What protocol?

458
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,797
You didn't tell them that
before they went in there.

459
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,664
Fitch, let them out.

460
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:12,862
Fitch, let them out!

461
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,701
I have to follow protocol.

462
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,230
Let them out, Fitch!

463
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,538
Go! Get out of there!

464
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,804
3...2...1.

465
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,812
I hope you realize
I had no choice,

466
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,781
but the protocol's
to burn the room in two minutes

467
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,442
if anything went wrong.

468
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,381
Attention all cars.

469
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,548
Unit 4
should pick him up first

470
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,956
unless he changes course.

471
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,457
Call Unit 4
if you make contact.

472
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,604
Where's a good place
to find a man?

473
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,199
There's plenty of guys

474
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,210
at the ld
around the corner.

475
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:57,247
You won't have any trouble
meeting somebody there.

476
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,748
Thank you.

477
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,341
Can't miss it.
Just look for the long line.

478
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,785
Hey, I need
your credit card

479
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,345
for room incidentals--

480
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,256
Iong-distance calls,
damage to the room, so forth.

481
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,554
Credit card?
Zip-zap?

482
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,753
Plastic--
American Express,

483
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,261
Visa, MasterCard?

484
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,265
There you go.
Thanks. All right.

485
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,596
Thank you.

486
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,693
Oh, hey,
wait a minute.

487
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,634
Hey! Hey!

488
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,398
You don't want this

489
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,375
falling into
the wrong hands.

490
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,433
No.

491
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,778
Here's Justin Crawl.
Holds it in.

492
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,282
[ Telephone Rings ]

493
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,784
18:.42 left to go here.

494
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,513
Yeah.

495
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,817
The conductor's
stolen credit card has turned up

496
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,379
at a motel in Hollywood.

497
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,449
The van's out front.
Let's go.

498
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,464
You two.

499
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,438
Enjoy yourself.

500
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,836
You, legs,
you're in.

501
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,635
Go on.

502
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,573
I'm down on my knees

503
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,580
I'm beggin' you, please

504
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,984
I'm down on my knees

505
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,023
I'm beggin' you, please

506
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,723
I'm down on my knees

507
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,595
Hey, hey,
where are you from?

508
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,827
I'm foreign.

509
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,392
You're what?

510
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,527
I'm foreign.

511
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,504
Foreign, really?

512
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,539
Easy. Easy.

513
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,837
I've got a party to go to

514
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,810
and no one to take me.

515
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,368
I'll take you.

516
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,380
You will?

517
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,403
Yeah.

518
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,847
I'm going to go to
the little girls' room.

519
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,374
You wait right here.

520
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,044
I'll be right back.

521
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,712
I'll be right here.

522
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,890
What's his name,
Greg or something?

523
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,466
Whatever it takes, right?

524
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,402
Hey, all's fair

525
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,879
in love and war.

526
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,114
Buddy.

527
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,658
Aah!

528
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,391
Aah!

529
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,862
Can't see much on that.

530
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,408
Get this tape back
to the lab. Enhance it.

531
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,809
Let's see if we can get
a better look at her.

532
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,403
She looks nice.

533
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,438
Do you have any idea
where she went?

534
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,814
I'll find her.

535
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,375
Wanted to know
where she could meet a man.

536
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,422
I suggested a club called the ld
around the corner.

537
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,649
Get the tape.

538
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,879
I've got a party to go to

539
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,881
and no one to take me.

540
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,439
Where is this party?

541
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,076
I don't know.

542
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,949
Aah!

543
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,453
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can't park there.

544
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,862
Back that up.

545
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,729
You can't go in there.

546
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,166
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

547
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,794
What's going on here?

548
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,512
Nobody leaves the club,
and I mean nobody.

549
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,783
There's always

00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,560
She walked.

733
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,126
She walked.

734
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,900
She walked that way.

735
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,570
Not too long ago.

736
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,647
Got some fruit
and cheese here.

737
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,582
What is that?

738
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,177
What do you mean,
the hot tub?

739
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,620
Hot tub.

740
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,179
I love this place.

741
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,590
It's away from the traffic
and the business

742
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,184
and all the people.

743
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,197
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. anymore.

744
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,198
Here.

745
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,859
We'll immortalize
the moment.

746
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,339
Look at the camera.
