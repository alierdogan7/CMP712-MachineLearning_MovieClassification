(MAN) Hello, I'm Ronald Merrick,

2
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,490
and I'm here to invite you
aboard our Starliner.

3
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,994
Yes, it's true! Day-to-day
living becomes a luxury cruise

4
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,790
when you've made your home
at Starliner Tower apartments.

00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:45,169
Although downtown Montreal is
only 12 and a half minutes away,

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,589
once you've crossed the
bridge to Starliner island,

8
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,387
might as well be a
million miles away.

9
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,889
Leave your car and the
tension of the city

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,977
in a space reserved for you in
our vast underground garage.

11
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,937
If friends have followed you home,

12
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,939
there's convenient parking for them

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,899
on ground level.

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,777

the breath-taking view

15
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,697
from your balcony or picture window.

Or if tennis is your game,

28
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:50,067
you won't have to wait for playing time
on our multiple courts, day or night.

an alternative to organ transplant.

You're bored, right?

177
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,955
To you, organ transplant is just
yesterday's kishkas, right?

178
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,633
Look. You've got Man, right?

179
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,763
And you've got parasites that
live in, on and around Man. Right?

180
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:21,139
So, why not breed a parasite
that can do something useful?

181
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,067
A parasite that can take over
the function of a human organ.

182
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:32,115
For example, you breed a parasite that
you implant in the human body cavity.

183
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,284
It hooks around the
circulatory system

184
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,537
and it filters the blood
just like a kidney does.

185
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,707
It takes a little blood for itself
once in a while. What do you care?

186
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,627
You've got enough.
You can afford to be generous.

187
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,838
- Huh? Are you following me?
- I am, I am.

188
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,175
Look, you've got a guy
with a bad kidney. Right?

189
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,386
You put the bug in him.
The bug goes to work on the kidney,

190
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,890
dissolves it, so the body assimilates it.
Now, what have you got?

191
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,977
You've got a perfectly good parasite
where you used to have a rotten kidney.

192
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:05,315
Right? I know you're going to say.
You're going to say it's crazy.

if you have any mustard.

195
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,617
- I think it's crazy.
- It's crazy, but who cares?

196
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,538
I mean, look, Hobbes
was a lousy teacher.

197
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,917
We've got to face the facts of life.
He was dull, academic, just plain lousy,

198
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:29,422
but he had a genius for one thing...
that was getting grants.

199
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,591
He could raise money
for crazy projects.

200
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,804

is paying the rent on this place?

407
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,258
Anyhow, I've been going through his

408
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,385
Hobbes was shafting us all.

409
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,181
Me, the university, the foundations,
the council, everybody.

410
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:34,520
- I don't quite get it.
- Hobbes believed that "man is an animal

411
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,731
"that thinks too much.
An over rational animal

412
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,984
"that has lost touch with its body and
its instincts." How do you like that?

In other words, too much
brain and not enough guts.

414

So what he came up with
to help our guts along

415
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,284
was a parasite that's...

416

and venereal disease

- He implanted her with a parasite,

apparently she went berserk.
