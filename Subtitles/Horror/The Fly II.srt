Yes, sir. Code four alert.

703
01:19:02,619 --> 01:19:05,656
Code four unit,
quarters 12, 14 and 17.

704
01:19:05,899 --> 01:19:07,537
Subject is dangerous.

705
01:19:07,739 --> 01:19:09,650
All zone four units to be armed.

706
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:12,459
This is to be a live capture.
Repeat, live capture.

707
01:19:29,619 --> 01:19:33,658
Control, at the end of corridor A,
something's moving around down there.

708
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:36,532
There are no other exits.
You've got it trapped.

709
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:38,412
Sick him.

713
01:21:56,419 --> 01:21:58,569
-Has anyone found him?
-Not yet.

714
01:21:58,819 --> 01:22:01,094
We're not exactly sure
what he looks like.

715
01:22:02,099 --> 01:22:04,818
Hold it. You wouldn't believe
what I'm looking at, sir.

716
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:06,975
Whatever it is,
it's dragging a body.

717
01:22:07,419 --> 01:22:09,535
What direction is it headed?

718
01:22:10,419 --> 01:22:14,014
I'd have to say, Mr. Bartok,
it's headed right in your direction.

719
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:17,128
Seal the door.

720
01:22:17,339 --> 01:22:20,411
Get reinforcements.
We can trap him in the hallway.

721
01:22:46,539 --> 01:22:49,133
-It's got a security card.
-Erase the code?

722
01:22:49,379 --> 01:22:50,528
Trimble!

723
01:23:10,099 --> 01:23:12,135
I've got him.
He's right outside Bay 1 7.

724
01:23:12,339 --> 01:23:14,534
Send reinforcements right now!

725
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:19,938

Come on, freak.

Shit!

729
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:22,335
Sorry guys, looks like I lost him.

730
01:24:22,619 --> 01:24:24,735

733

Nothing gets through those doors.

734
01:24:48,619 --> 01:24:50,735
The upper doors have a manual lockout.

735
01:24:50,979 --> 01:24:52,537

The rest of you let's go. Come on!

-Just tell them to kill it.
-Don't be an idiot.

I need a live subject.
Martin is of no use dead.

742
01:25:49,939 --> 01:25:53,488
He's right, Mr. Bartok. Your
Martin's already killed three people.

743
01:25:54,419 --> 01:25:59,015
That's tragic and sad, but I haven't
come this far to lose everything now.

744
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:08,890
Clever. Clever boy.

745
01:26:13,259 --> 01:26:15,614
OFFICER: Control, he's in the air
ducts headed for zone four.

746
01:26:15,819 --> 01:26:17,537
Control, where's that air duct lead?

747
01:26:18,019 --> 01:26:20,089
Hold on, hold on.
I'm getting it.

Don't do anything rash.

in a second, if I have to.

have to end like this.
