Someone call Kerry.

The call came in at 11:45.
The woman heard an explosion.

The fire department was
the first on the scene.

Kerry.

- Before you go in there...

Eric. Is it him?

What happened?

42
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,153
The victim was held
in place by these chains.

<i>you have returned</i>

53
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,348
<i>More comfortable in chains</i>
<i>than you are in freedom.</i>

54
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,989
<i>Tonight we will see how</i>
<i>far you are willing to go</i>

55
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,462
<i>to break those chains</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

56
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:35,099

This was the bomb.

59
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:03,722
All he had to do was release
himself from each of the chains...

60
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:06,996
walk out the door
before it went off.

61
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,104
All he had to do?

62
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:18,685

74
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:56,481
[Kerry] I really had this feeling
it was going to be him.

75
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:59,687
Kerry, Eric is
a missing persons case,

76
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:01,224
not a homicide case.

77
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:07,236
I've been having
nightmares where I see him.

78
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,818
I'm never going to be able to
forgive myself for what happened.

79
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:17,323
Listen, it's not your fault.

80
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,492
It's always
somebody's fault.

81
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,162
That somebody isn't you.

82
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,700
That someone
is still out there.

83
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:26,842
So put all your anger into
finding them and putting them away.

84
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,846
All right?

85
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:31,684
What I don't understand is

86
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,355
how the hell could Jigsaw
do all of this?

87
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:36,127
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

88
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,402
I'm not so sure
he did.

89
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,774
So far this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.

90
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,177
Meaning?

91
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,982
Well...how'd
you get in here?

92
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,320
We cut the door down.
[Kerry] Why?

93
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:51,658
Because somebody heard
an explosion and

94
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,028
called us.

95
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,965
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?

96
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,802
It was welded shut.

97
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,271
Bloody truck
couldn't get in here.

98
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,607
Exactly.

99
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,644
I don't follow.

100
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,083
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was to
get out before the bomb went off,

101
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,954
then why was the door
welded shut?

102
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:08,391
The guy couldn't
get out if he wanted to.

103
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,531
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.

<i>Dead on the inside.</i>

116
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:34,103
<i>You identify more</i>
<i>with a cold corpse</i>

117
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,107
<i>than you do</i>
<i>with a living human.</i>

118
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,346
<i>I believe you want</i>
<i>to join your true family,</i>

<i>And by the time</i>
<i>this tape is finished,</i>

123
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:53,809
<i>you will have one minute</i>
<i>to find a way out.</i>

124
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,282
<i>At the end of that minute,</i>
<i>you should know</i>

125
00:14:57,283 --> 00:15:00,489

126
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,695

127

<i>It is right in front of you.</i>

128
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:09,039
<i>All you have to do is</i>
<i>reach in and take it.</i>

129
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,879
<i>But do it quickly.</i>

130
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,022

Pressure back to 80.

181
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,726
Pressure normal.

182
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:05,883
If you got something on your mind,
just don't bring it in here.

183
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,804
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

184
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,575
The woman standing in front
of me had to be dragged

185
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,548
from the locker room to put a
chest tube in a trauma patient?

186
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,452
Lynn Denlon should have
been the first one there.

187
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,195
Lynn.

188
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:22,232
Lynn!

189
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,671
What the hell?

190
00:20:58,672 --> 00:20:59,707
I'm locked in!

191
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,410
[muted]
Is anybody there?

192
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,014
Hello?

193
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:13,000
Anybody here?

194
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:31,872
[screaming]

195
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:47,536
[hinges creaking]

196
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:29,520
[muffled screaming]

197
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,567
[muffled yelling]

198
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:39,741
Help! Help me!

199
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,416
Help!

200
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,932
[gasping] Who are you?
Who are you?

201
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,969
What is this?

202
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,106
[hyperventilating]

203
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:59,948
What are you doing?
- Shhh.

204
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:02,586
[gasping]

205
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:05,859
Are you gonna behave?

206
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,078
Let's go.

207
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:19,954
What is this place?!
What is this place?!

208
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,225
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

209
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,644
What is...this place?
[breathing fearfully]

210
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:41,430
Who are you?
Who are you?

211
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:42,365
[screaming]

212
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,010
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

213
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:52,887
You may not remember me, but
I most certainly remember you.

214
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:58,431
I was a guest
at your hospital once.

215
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:02,606
Where am I?

216
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,750
Do you remember me?

217
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:18,571
I've seen you on television.

218
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,980
Lawrence Gordon
was your doctor.

219
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:26,453
I was his patient,
and he was mine.

220
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:29,827
As you can see
from that report,

221
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,630
my prognosis
isn't good.

222
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,438
Would you agree?

223
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:44,857
There's no preventative
treatment for what you have.

224
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,963
I remember you saying
that to me once before

225
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:50,601
in almost the exact
same tone.

226
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:54,409
Leave it to a doctor to find
such a cold, clinical way

227
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,582
of saying I'm
a dead man walking.

228
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,355
Looking at me, how long
would you say I have left?

229
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:03,594
I'd have to examine you.

230
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:06,533
Even then, a frontal lobe
tumor is unpredictable.

231
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:10,074
The growth depends on the rate
of mitosis versus apoptosis--

232
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:14,616
I'm sorry, but there's all this
crude medical equipment around me

233
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:18,190
causing you to believe that
you're still inside a hospital.

234
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:21,130
No.
- Then why are you speaking to me

235
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:24,202
in that graduate school
medical jargon?

236
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,777
Look at me!

237
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,248
Aaahh! Aah! Uhh!

238
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:32,218
Now, you look at me.

239
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,824
I asked you
a simple question.

240
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,660
Based on your experience,

241
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,301
how long do you
think I have left?

242
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,539
It's not a simple answer.

243
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,615
Based on your file,
I'd say...not long.

244
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:49,954
[coughing]

245
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,437
Death is a surprise party.

246
00:25:58,438 --> 00:26:04,149
Unless, of course...you're
already dead on the inside.

247
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:09,059
Unless you're
the type of person

248
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,967
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

249
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:15,238
Turns their back
on their husband.

250
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,442
Neglects their child.

251
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,081
Who has every possible
advantage in life

252
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:22,652
but chooses not to advance.

253
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:24,556
What do you want from me?

254
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:27,897
What do I want?

255
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,370
I want to play a game.

256
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,449
The rules of the game
are simple.

257
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,356
The consequences for
breaking them are great.

258
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,127
Death.

259
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,537
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested.

260
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:50,575
Your will to keep
someone alive.

261
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,514
Can you do that?
Can you follow the rules

262
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:55,451
and grant someone the gift of life?
- What is this?

263
00:26:55,452 --> 00:26:57,723
No! Get it--aah!

264
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:01,764
No! No! What is this!
What are you doing

265
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,367
to me?

266
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,104
Aah! Aah!

267
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:13,220
The device that you're wearing is
linked to my heart rate monitor.

268
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:16,160
The second that heart
rate monitor flatlines

269
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:18,097
or you move out of range,

270
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:21,069
an explosion will
go off in that collar.

271
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,444
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.

272
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:28,885
Please. Please don't
do this to me.

273
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,791
I have a family.
I have a family.

274
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,129
Let me give you
the simple version.

275
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,472
You will keep him alive,
whatever it takes.

276
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:44,115
No excuses.
No equivocations.

277
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:46,019
[whispers]
No crying.

278
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,692
What do you mean,
keep him alive?

279
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:56,473
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

280
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,511
A man.

281
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:04,589
He will face
a series of tests.

282
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,767
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.

283
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:13,173
If he completes
all of his tests

284
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:14,977
and John is still breathing,

285
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:17,515
then I will
remove your collar...

286
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,223
...and you're
free to go.

287
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:22,392
Uhh!

288
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:24,997
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.

289
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:28,672
A critical part of what
could be my final test.

290
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,282
Amanda, it's time
to start our game.

291
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:52,853
[pounding]

292
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:06,648
Help!

293
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:14,129
Hello!

294
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:18,972
Is there anybody out there?

295
00:29:27,356 --> 00:29:28,758
[recording device on]

296
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,129
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

297
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,872
<i>Over the past few years, you have
become a shell of your former self...</i>

298
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:39,179

<i>Vengeance against the killer,</i>
<i>who to your surprise</i>

302
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:52,840
<i>and dismay, was set free</i>
<i>after a hasty trial.</i>

303
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:57,248
<i>Today, however, it is you</i>
<i>who will be put on trial.</i>

304
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:02,292
<i>To escape from where you are, you will
have to face a series of tests.</i>

305
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:06,668
<i>You will have to suffer to move
forward through each of them.</i>

306
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:11,043
<i>But with each one, you</i>
<i>will also have a chance...</i>

307
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:14,282
<i>a chance to forgive.</i>

308
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:15,652
<i>When you complete the tests,</i>

309
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:19,192
<i>I promise you you will</i>
<i>finally come face to face</i>

310
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,198
<i>with the man responsible</i>
<i>for the loss of your child.</i>

311
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:25,371
<i>That will be</i>
<i>your ultimate test.</i>

312
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:27,910
<i>Can you forgive him?</i>

313
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,682
<i>You better hurry, though.</i>

314
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:34,022
<i>In two hours,</i>

315

317
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:44,576

You fucking killed my son.

321
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,108
Don't you fuckin' beg.

322
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:21,183
Do you know who I am?

323
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:34,877
I'll fuckin' teach you,
you motherfucker.

324
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:37,014
This is what
you fuckin' deserve.

325
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:59,292
Where is it?

326
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,896
What?

327
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:04,135
Where is it?

328
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:13,086
How many times?

329
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:16,426
How many times
do I have to tell you

330
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:17,963
before you get it
in your head?

331
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:20,869
I just wanted
to sleep with something.

332
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,873
No. No. You just--nothin'.

333
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:27,783
You don't...touch things
in Dylan's room.

334
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,626
Okay?

You know I love you,

Mm-hmm.

What do you think Mommy would
say if she saw us like this?

Hello?

Hello?

345
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,649
Hey!

346
00:36:15,038 --> 00:36:17,308
All right, John.
I need you to look at my nose.

347
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,343
Right here.

348
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:22,051
Look at my nose, please?

349
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:24,690
Follow my flashlight.

00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,046
That hurt?

00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:43,560
It's begun.

354
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:46,867
He's out of the box.

355
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:53,748
So?

hospital and have an operation

Oh, good. Yeah.

372
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:40,407
Maybe we could try
some corticoid steroids,

373
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,378

like Dexamethasone.

Are you ready to go

Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

501
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:22,665
Otherwise he's likely
to get upset,

- Boom.

503
00:50:25,304 --> 00:50:28,376
Then you just have to find
the sensor and disarm it

so you can walk more
than 30 feet out that door

detonating.

506

the collar off yourself.

could be tricky.

in the wrong place

509

01:30:55,228 --> 01:30:57,699
I understand she's quite
a little athlete.

899
01:31:04,314 --> 01:31:06,917
[John]
Or we could talk about your son.

900
01:31:06,918 --> 01:31:08,220
What did you say?

901
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:13,798
Why are you living
with the dead

902
01:31:13,799 --> 01:31:15,969
when you have such
a beautiful family,

903
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:20,278
<i>a husband who</i>
<i>is indeed alone,</i>

904
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:22,649
<i>a daughter who needs</i>
<i>her mother,</i>

905
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:26,257
<i>patients who need</i>
<i>a competent physician</i>

906
01:31:26,258 --> 01:31:28,193
who looks them in the eye

907
01:31:28,194 --> 01:31:30,532
and treats them
like human beings?

908
01:31:30,533 --> 01:31:32,669
He's completed
the third test.

909
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:35,107
Congratulations, Lynn.

910
01:31:35,108 --> 01:31:36,209
You're free to go.

911
01:31:37,947 --> 01:31:40,117
Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.

912
01:31:41,822 --> 01:31:44,893
Undo her collar, Amanda,
and let her go.

913
01:31:44,894 --> 01:31:47,632
No, he's not finished.

914
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:49,303
He's not all the way.

915
01:31:49,304 --> 01:31:53,277
Amanda, Lynn is more
important than you know.

916
01:31:53,278 --> 01:31:57,386
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

917
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:59,590
I said no.

918
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:05,468
Amanda, there are rules.

919
01:32:08,776 --> 01:32:10,779
She doesn't deserve
to go free.

920
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:11,814
You promised.

921
01:32:11,815 --> 01:32:13,384
I didn't promise you shit.

922
01:32:13,385 --> 01:32:15,955
Amanda, even with that gun,

923
01:32:15,956 --> 01:32:21,166
it is Lynn who holds
your life in her hand.

924
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,269
Fuck you.

925
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:24,573
You give her control over me?

926
01:32:24,574 --> 01:32:26,042
Fuck you!

927
01:32:26,043 --> 01:32:28,247
I won't tell anyone.
I promise I won't.

928
01:32:28,248 --> 01:32:29,650
Please, I have a family.

929
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:32,389
Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

930
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:34,560
And stop fuckin'
moving around!

931
01:32:34,561 --> 01:32:36,897
What about the other test
subjects that we left alive?

932
01:32:38,635 --> 01:32:40,872
Game over.
- I'll fuckin' kill you!

933
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:42,375
What about them?

934
01:32:42,376 --> 01:32:44,580
Was that how you felt
about them?

935
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:50,023
<i>Was that how you felt</i>
<i>about Eric Matthews?</i>

936
01:32:50,024 --> 01:32:51,159
Eric Matthews.

937
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,429
[Lynn]
Let me go.

938
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:56,069
I'll tell you how I felt
about Eric Matthews.

939
01:33:02,316 --> 01:33:05,321
[screaming, sobbing]

940
01:33:14,307 --> 01:33:16,075
[screams]

941
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:27,499
[Eric]
Daniel!

942
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,901
Fuck.

943
01:33:31,073 --> 01:33:33,411
Fuck!
- Damn you!

944
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:47,606
Daniel!

945
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,168
Fuck!

946
01:34:33,432 --> 01:34:34,533
Fuck.

947
01:34:43,418 --> 01:34:45,153
[screams]

948
01:34:52,068 --> 01:34:54,940
[chomp]
Aaaahhh!

949
01:35:03,525 --> 01:35:07,064
[screaming]

950
01:35:07,065 --> 01:35:08,868
[Eric]
Where's Daniel?

951
01:35:26,605 --> 01:35:27,872
Where's my son?

952
01:35:30,613 --> 01:35:32,449
Where is he,
you junkie bitch?

953
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,718
Fuck you.

954
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:38,227
Where is he?!

955
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,891
Tell me where he is.

956
01:35:53,892 --> 01:35:55,662
Tell me where he is.

957
01:35:55,663 --> 01:35:57,899
Right fuckin' here.

958
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,572
You bitch!

959
01:36:22,817 --> 01:36:24,319
You're nothin', bitch!

960
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:29,596
You're nothing!

961
01:36:29,597 --> 01:36:32,502
[sobbing]

962
01:36:34,207 --> 01:36:35,708
You're not Jigsaw.

963
01:36:40,219 --> 01:36:42,322
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

964
01:36:52,108 --> 01:36:53,043
You hear me?

965
01:36:55,081 --> 01:36:56,750
You're nothing!

966
01:36:59,657 --> 01:37:01,327
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

967
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:06,236
You're nothin'!

968
01:37:10,346 --> 01:37:12,014
I'll fuckin' kill you!

969
01:37:13,218 --> 01:37:14,219
No!

970
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,022
That's right.

971
01:37:16,023 --> 01:37:17,992
I'm a murderer.

972
01:37:17,993 --> 01:37:20,665
He took my life from me,

973
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:23,003
so I just returned
the fuckin' favor.

974
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:26,777
[John] No, Amanda, that's
what you thought, but I know

975
01:37:26,778 --> 01:37:28,547
different.

976
01:37:28,548 --> 01:37:31,119
You left him for dead,
didn't you?

977
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,622
Stop fucking with me.

978
01:37:32,623 --> 01:37:35,962
But I cleaned up
your mistakes.

979
01:37:35,963 --> 01:37:38,200
I forgave you for them.

980
01:37:40,305 --> 01:37:42,242
[Lynn]
Let me go! Please!

981
01:37:42,243 --> 01:37:45,348
<i>[Amanda] What you do is</i>
<i>no different than murder.</i>

982
01:37:45,349 --> 01:37:48,287
<i>You torture people.</i>
<i>You watch them die.</i>

983
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:51,326
But now you're begging me not
to kill this worthless bitch

984
01:37:51,327 --> 01:37:53,197
on the grounds
of some game?

985
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:55,535
You are walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

986
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,137
Step back.

987
01:37:57,138 --> 01:37:58,541
It's bullshit.

988
01:37:58,542 --> 01:38:01,179
<i>Nobody changes.</i>

989
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,215
<i>It's all a lie.</i>

990
01:38:02,216 --> 01:38:04,219
If you fail in this,
we all fail.

991
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:06,490
Succeed,
and we all succeed.

992
01:38:06,491 --> 01:38:08,093
It's a lie!

993
01:38:13,505 --> 01:38:16,610
I'll tell you,
she hasn't changed,

994
01:38:16,611 --> 01:38:18,848
because nobody
fuckin' changes.

995
01:38:21,019 --> 01:38:22,355
Nobody is reborn.

996
01:38:22,356 --> 01:38:23,624
It's all bullshit!

997
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:25,728
It's all a fuckin' lie!

998
01:38:25,729 --> 01:38:28,501
And I'm just a pawn
in your stupid games.

999
01:38:41,528 --> 01:38:43,697
I don't mean
anything to you.

1000
01:38:43,698 --> 01:38:46,403
No, you mean
everything to me.

1001
01:38:46,404 --> 01:38:48,240
Fuck you!

1002
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:50,010
Our fates are linked.

1003
01:38:51,448 --> 01:38:53,684
I've tried
to help you, Amanda.

1004
01:38:53,685 --> 01:38:55,655
So, help me!

1005
01:38:55,656 --> 01:38:57,192
Fix me!

1006
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:00,431
Fix me, motherfucker!

1007
01:39:02,203 --> 01:39:03,737
I'm standin' right here.

1008
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:10,351
Why is she so important to you?

1009
01:39:11,955 --> 01:39:13,958
She's not important to me.

1010
01:39:15,863 --> 01:39:17,499
She's important to <i>you.</i>

1011
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,870
She's not important to me.

1012
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:23,511
I beg you
to reconsider that.

1013
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:31,260
This is your
last chance, Amanda.

1014
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:32,462
She's nothing.

1015
01:39:49,363 --> 01:39:51,300
Your time's running out.

1016
01:39:55,007 --> 01:39:56,677
Now, you think about
what you're doing.

1017
01:40:00,586 --> 01:40:02,856
<i>Think about everything</i>
<i>that you've done.</i>

1018
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:13,344
You think about
what you promised me.

1019
01:40:13,345 --> 01:40:16,115
<i>Think about our dreams.</i>

1020
01:40:16,116 --> 01:40:17,685
Think about tomorrow.

1021
01:40:20,726 --> 01:40:22,328
Lynn?

1022
01:40:22,329 --> 01:40:23,898
Jeff! Jeff--

1023
01:40:25,101 --> 01:40:26,135
Lynn.

1024
01:40:28,642 --> 01:40:29,776
Lynn.

1025
01:40:29,777 --> 01:40:31,813
Lynn.
- Jeff.

1026
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:34,553
You just destroyed
four lives.

1027
01:40:35,889 --> 01:40:37,559
You just murdered
Jeff's wife.

1028
01:40:55,395 --> 01:40:57,532
Unhh! Unhh!

1029
01:40:57,533 --> 01:40:59,369
Baby.

1030
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:00,671
Amanda.

1031
01:41:03,445 --> 01:41:04,379
It's okay.

1032
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:08,254
[sobbing]

1033
01:41:10,525 --> 01:41:11,727
This was <i>your</i> test...

1034
01:41:13,298 --> 01:41:14,833
...your game.

1035
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:18,540
[John]
What do I want?

1036
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:20,143
I want to play a game.

1037
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,051
You're being tested.

1038
01:41:24,052 --> 01:41:25,288
Your will
is being tested--

1039
01:41:25,289 --> 01:41:27,392
<i> Your will to keep</i>
someone alive.

1040
01:41:27,393 --> 01:41:28,394
Can you do that?

1041
01:41:28,395 --> 01:41:30,231
<i>Can you</i>
<i>follow the rules</i>

1042
01:41:30,232 --> 01:41:32,100
and grant someone
the gift of life?

1043
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,310
I was testing you.

1044
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:38,280
I took you in.

1045
01:41:38,281 --> 01:41:40,418
You will give
everything to me.

1046
01:41:40,419 --> 01:41:42,689
Yes.

1047
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:45,428
<i>I selected you for the honor</i>

1048
01:41:45,429 --> 01:41:47,765
<i>of carrying on</i>
<i>my life's work.</i>

1049
01:41:47,766 --> 01:41:49,769
<i>But you didn't.</i>

1050
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:50,638
That's right.

1051
01:41:52,676 --> 01:41:53,777
I'm a murderer.

1052
01:41:53,778 --> 01:41:55,080
I despise murderers.

1053
01:41:55,081 --> 01:41:57,418
You didn't test
anyone's will to live.

1054
01:41:57,419 --> 01:41:58,754
Game over.

1055
01:42:00,091 --> 01:42:02,762
<i>Instead you took away</i>
<i>their only chance.</i>

1056
01:42:02,763 --> 01:42:05,501
<i>Your games were unwinnable.</i>

1057
01:42:05,502 --> 01:42:07,705
<i>Your subjects merely victims.</i>

1058
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:11,112
There is no turning back.

1059
01:42:11,113 --> 01:42:13,183
Do you understand that?

1060
01:42:13,184 --> 01:42:18,694
<i>In my desperation,
I decided to give you one last chance.</i>

1061
01:42:18,695 --> 01:42:21,466
<i>So I put</i>
<i>everything in place.</i>

1062
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,706
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

1063
01:42:24,707 --> 01:42:26,610
That's one reason
I chose her.

1064
01:42:26,611 --> 01:42:30,785
<i>You didn't know that
Lynn and Jeff were husband and wife.</i>

1065
01:42:30,786 --> 01:42:36,128
<i>I had to keep that from you</i>
<i>for the purposes of my game.</i>

1066
01:42:36,129 --> 01:42:38,400
<i>I had to leave out</i>
<i>the ruined marriage,</i>

1067
01:42:38,401 --> 01:42:41,673
<i>the cheating wife,</i>

1068
01:42:41,674 --> 01:42:46,483
<i>the vengeful husband,</i>
<i>the neglected daughter.</i>

1069
01:42:46,484 --> 01:42:51,526
<i>And I let you make</i>
<i>your own choices.</i>

1070
01:42:51,527 --> 01:42:54,866
I wanted you to succeed.

1071
01:42:54,867 --> 01:42:57,972
Amanda, put it away.

1072
01:42:57,973 --> 01:43:00,277
Trust me,
even with that gun,

1073
01:43:00,278 --> 01:43:04,084
it's Lynn who holds
your life in her hands.

1074
01:43:04,085 --> 01:43:08,360
She's not
important to me.

1075
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:10,331
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

1076
01:43:10,332 --> 01:43:12,769
I said no!

01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,006
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

1078
01:43:15,007 --> 01:43:17,278
We need to abide
by those rules.

1079
01:43:19,383 --> 01:43:20,284
You couldn't.

1080
01:43:26,698 --> 01:43:28,367
God.

1081
01:43:34,447 --> 01:43:35,381
[Amanda coughing]

1082
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:45,434
Game over.

1083
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:00,231
You haven't learned
anything tonight, have you?

1084
01:44:00,232 --> 01:44:01,733
Your rage
and your vengeance

1085
01:44:01,734 --> 01:44:04,539
will only hurt
the ones you love.

1086
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:07,845
Killing me will only add
to your misery.

1087
01:44:07,846 --> 01:44:10,618
It will not bring back
your son.

1088
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:12,688
Think of your daughter,
Jeff.

1089
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:15,059
She needs you now
more than ever.

1090
01:44:16,798 --> 01:44:18,801
You can't kill me, Jeff.

1091
01:44:26,918 --> 01:44:28,454
[click]

1092
01:44:28,455 --> 01:44:30,591
[Jeff sobs]
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

1093
01:44:30,592 --> 01:44:34,098
Her time's running out.

1094
01:44:34,099 --> 01:44:35,768
[Jeff drops pistol]

1095
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:45,888
Jeff, do not miscalculate.

1096
01:44:45,889 --> 01:44:47,625
Your fate is in my hands.

1097
01:44:47,626 --> 01:44:50,564
Your wife's fate
is in my hands.

1098
01:44:50,565 --> 01:44:52,902
I love you.

1099
01:44:52,903 --> 01:44:54,506
I love you.

1100
01:44:58,414 --> 01:45:01,118
I'm taking you home. Okay?

1101
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:04,759
Though you may not
see any threat...

1102
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,165
there are threats
all around you.

1103
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:10,103
Jeff, if you try to move
your wife, she will die.

1104
01:45:10,104 --> 01:45:12,942
I can have an ambulance
here in four minutes.

1105
01:45:12,943 --> 01:45:15,781
Would you like to take your
wife out of here tonight?

1106
01:45:15,782 --> 01:45:17,385
Would you like
to take her to safety?

1107
01:45:17,386 --> 01:45:18,620
Stay.

1108
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:20,224
Stand and face me, Jeff.

1109
01:45:20,225 --> 01:45:23,564
Stay with me, please.
- Right now.

1110
01:45:23,565 --> 01:45:27,003
Would you like to get
your life back?

1111
01:45:27,004 --> 01:45:27,972
Would you, Jeff?

1112
01:45:27,973 --> 01:45:29,542
I can make that happen.

1113
01:45:32,048 --> 01:45:34,152
Which is it, Jeff?

1114
01:45:34,153 --> 01:45:36,456
Come on...yes or no?

1115
01:45:36,457 --> 01:45:37,425
Yes.

1116
01:45:40,632 --> 01:45:42,033
What do you want?

1117
01:45:42,034 --> 01:45:43,704
One final test.

1118
01:45:43,705 --> 01:45:45,674
The rules are simple.

1119
01:45:45,675 --> 01:45:51,219
Over on that table, there's
a host of vicious implements...

1120
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:54,859
...which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,

1121
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:56,263
to take your vengeance,

1122
01:45:56,264 --> 01:45:59,602
to indulge your obsession.

1123
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:04,946
Or you can choose to put
your vengeance aside,

1124
01:46:04,947 --> 01:46:06,883
and you can forgive.

1125
01:46:08,655 --> 01:46:12,127
You can forgive me
for the pain

1126
01:46:12,128 --> 01:46:14,766
that I've caused you
and your wife tonight.

1127
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:17,438
[Lynn]
Jeff.

1128
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:19,041
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

1129
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:23,317
[saw blade clatters]

1130
01:46:23,318 --> 01:46:25,588
Honey, don't do it.

1131
01:46:25,589 --> 01:46:27,725
Jeff...

1132
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:31,266
It's up to you.

1133
01:46:31,267 --> 01:46:32,435
[Lynn]
I need you.

1134
01:46:32,436 --> 01:46:35,608
Live or die, Jeff?

1135
01:46:35,609 --> 01:46:37,378
Make our choice.

1136
01:46:55,014 --> 01:46:56,081
I forgive you.

1137
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:05,467
Jeff...

1138
01:47:05,468 --> 01:47:08,072
Jeff. Jeff!

1139
01:47:17,124 --> 01:47:18,193
[no audible dialogue]

1140
01:47:32,589 --> 01:47:34,626
I forgive you.

1141
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,936
[beeping]

1142
01:47:47,051 --> 01:47:48,553
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

1143
01:47:48,554 --> 01:47:53,430
<i>I made this tape as an insurance
policy, if you will.</i>

1144
01:47:53,431 --> 01:47:55,901
Jeff!

1145
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:58,039
<i>And if you're</i>
<i>listening to it,</i>

1146
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,809
<i>then it's time to collect.</i>

1147
01:48:01,714 --> 01:48:05,721
<i>I was your final test</i>
<i>of forgiveness.</i>

1148
01:48:05,722 --> 01:48:07,491
<i>And if you are</i>
<i>listening to this,</i>

1149
01:48:07,492 --> 01:48:09,362
<i>then you failed.</i>

1150
01:48:10,832 --> 01:48:14,138
<i>Now you must pay</i>
<i>the price...</i>

1151
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:16,810
the price for living
<i>for nothing but vengeance.</i>

1152
01:48:16,811 --> 01:48:21,085
<i>Now I will give you</i>
<i>something to live for.</i>

1153
01:48:21,086 --> 01:48:23,924
<i>I told you that</i>
<i>you couldn't kill me, Jeff,</i>

1154
01:48:23,925 --> 01:48:26,329
<i>but I didn't tell you why,</i>

1155
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:28,133
<i>and the answer is simple.</i>

1156
01:48:28,134 --> 01:48:32,040
<i>I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.</i>

1157
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:39,087
I am the only person who
knows where your daughter is.

1158
01:48:39,088 --> 01:48:42,561
<i>She only has a limited</i>
<i>supply of air, Jeff,</i>

1159
01:48:42,562 --> 01:48:43,597
<i>and if you want</i>
<i>to get her back,</i>

1160
01:48:43,598 --> 01:48:45,534
<i>you'll have to play a game.</i>

1161
01:48:51,647 --> 01:48:53,082
Jeff!
