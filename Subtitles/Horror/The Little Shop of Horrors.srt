We have a new client.

00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:08,508
I can not even afford to fire that guy.

24
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:15,552

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,320

No no no. Mushnick.
Two gladioli and ferns.

You want me to put two gladioli in the pot with fern?

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,124
No, a fern. There are three things separately.

Carnations.

55
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,564
As you lose your, someone dies.

56
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,771
He has had very bad luck, Ms. Shiva.

57
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:16,367
If it had been given? Ado dir not you know? As the same.

? His is a small tent? A.

68
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:55,585
Large stores are expensive and pretty flowers.

69
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,707
The better you look, the worse the taste.

70
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,633
I like the little known sites.

71
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:04,432
Look to eat the flowers.

72
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,435
Do not say anything if you have not tried.

73
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,239
Look what happened.

74
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:14,160
This is what I refer? A.

75
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:17,674
Look at the quality of their work.

76
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:22,118
If you say goodbye,? D? Nde get? as good a job?

77
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:23,565
? It's going to fire me?

78

- Gravis, you can not do it.
- Why? do not?

81
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,082
- It's been unintentionally.
- As usual.

82
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:40,250
Like when you sent the bouquet wishing good health to the funeral.

83
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:43,692
... Or when you sent black lilies to the elderly in the hospital.

84
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:48,608
Tambi? N was unintentionally.
But this time I'm serious.

85
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,096
But I always try to do the right thing.

86
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,620
I love the flowers.

87
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,773
I like flowers almost as much as Audrey.

88
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,382
Very good. Est? S he fired.

89
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,180
- Why? You do not give him a chance?
- The chance to say goodbye.

90
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,260
I will not fire.

91
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,739
You are very brave.
Est? S he fired.

92
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,898
But it's not fair.
Do you know what I'm doing?

93
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:13,748
I'm working on a special plant.

94
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,225
It is a plant that has not seen jam? s.

95
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,707
I can not even sell the store.

96
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,510
- Out!
- Wait.

97
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,589
If a new plant has to see it.

98
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:24,830
I do not look at the flowers.

99
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:28,227
My ancestors s? They engaged in this, 200 years.

100
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,672
But I have a stinking Skid Row Store.

101
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,510
And do I like flowers.

102
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:33,833
Does not understand me.

103
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,753
I have eaten in vase? Ace worldwide.

104
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,397
And those plants m? Extra s? Ace earn m? S money.

105
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,393
? You see ?,? You see?

106

00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:48,042
Very good. Tell me more.

108
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:52,319
I remember one with a wall covered with poison ivy.

109
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,962
People see? A very far to see it and buy it.

110
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,284
? And due? Or got rich?

111
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,129
No, it scratched? to death in a madhouse.

112
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,446
That was my cousin Harry.

113
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:05,170
According.

114
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:09,413
Come home and brings that plant.

115
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:12,334
Yes? L said to be a attraction? No, you keep your job.

116

If not, you take? both.

117
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:16,888
Do not worry, you like ?.

118
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:41,106
This has been more music to inv annelids.

119
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,587
We continue to serenade the asylum.

120
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:48,545
- Seymour, are you?
- S ?, mom ?.

121

? Do you feel sorry for your poor mother?

123
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:01,831
Ri? Ndote when it has one foot in the grave.

124
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,234
I said unintentionally.

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,716
Always unintentionally. M? Rame language.

126
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,555
All languages ​​look alike to me.

127
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:13,639
You got the results of my an? Lysis?

128
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:15,676
S ?, the doctor says you have nothing.

129

Dr. Mallard thought always dec? Truth.

130
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,846
He says he could? As the Rams play.

131
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:25,849
I want to die.
Should be assistant medical examiner.

132
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:32,243
I think back to have mumps.
The notice each morning.

133
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,330
That's when you eat the grapes.

134

If you do not like Mr. Mushnick, fire me ?.

00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:39,475
I think I'm deaf.

147
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:46,561
It looks like your job depends on that floor.

148
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,367
Est? worse than this morning.
