1
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:19,224
I've told you before,
I don't want you to read this crap!

2
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:21,958
I never saw such rotten crap in my life!

3
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:24,762
Where do you get this shit?
Who sells it to you?

4
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,903
I am talking to you, young man!
Answer me when I talk to you!

5
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:32,266
You remember who puts the bread
on the damn table around here!

6
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,708
Don't be too hard on him.
All the kids read them.

7
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:36,507
My boy isn't all the kids!

8
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:41,073
Do you want to know where this is going?
Right into the garbage!

9
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:43,412
You got any smart mouth about that?

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,212
I don't see how it's any worse
than the books you keep in your dresser!

11
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,816
The ones under your underwear.
Those sex books!

12
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:52,388
You didn't have to--

13
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,192
Hit him? Not only do l find out
he's reading this crap...

14
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,789
...but he's a little snoop as well!

15
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:58,357
lt wasn't like that!

16
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:01,767
You asked me to get your cufflinks!
lt was on Sunday!

17
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:05,466
l'll go down and close the windows
before the rain gets in.

18
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:08,511
l'll do it. l got some garbage
l want to throw away.

19
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:11,607
Daddy, please, don't throw it away.
l'm sorry.

20
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:15,548
Next time l find you with a worthless
piece of shit like this again...

21
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:17,712
...you won't sit down for a week!

22
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:19,620
You remember that!

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,279
Tuck in.

24
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,238
That takes care of that.

25
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,974
Stan, don't you think you were
a little hard on him?

26
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:48,241
Did you see that crap?

27
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:52,114
All that horror crap. Things coming out
of crates and eating people?

28
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:55,852
Dead people coming back to life?
People turning into weeds?

29
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,926
-Yes, l did, but--
-Do you want him reading that stuff?

30
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,089
-Well, no, but--
-All right, then.

31
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,830
l took care of it.

32
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,794
That's why God made fathers, babe.

33
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,768
That's why God made fathers.

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,407
l hope you rot in hell!

35
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,448
Do you really think she'll be out?

36
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:40,178
Of course she will, Richard.
You know that.

37
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:43,483
You can set your watch by her.
6:00 on the dot.

38
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,651
Pass those scones, Cass.

39
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,096
You're such a hog.

40
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
You married a great hog, Henry.

41
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,630
But then, l suppose you know that,
don't you?

42
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:59,501
Our Cass has always had
such an extremely healthy appetite.

43
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,177
Who is coming out, Cass?

44
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:07,239
You mean Cass hasn't told you
about dotty old great Aunt Bedelia?

45
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,314
The patriarch of our clan?

46
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:12,414
lsn't she the one
who was supposed to have...?

47
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:17,289
Supposed to have murdered her father?
Yes.

48
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,291
Bedelia is my aunt.

49
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:27,627
Which means that she is
Richard and Cass's great aunt.

50
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:30,366
Which also means
that she's older than God.

51
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:34,437
But her father, Nathan,
was even older and meaner than that.

52
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:38,810
You're all a bunch of dirty vultures...

53
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:44,217
...just waiting to get your hands
on my money!

54
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:48,423
He was hysterically jealous
of Bedelia all his life.

55
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,885
A complete Freudian relationship.

56
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:54,891
Then when he was about 184,
he had a stroke.

57
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:58,365
And lucky Bedelia,
she got to nurse him full-time.

58
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:01,026
Then she met a fella.

59
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:04,363
Yes, sir, a real September courtship.

60
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,137
September courtship!

61
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:09,007
This was October or November,
at the very latest.

62
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,271
He was 75!

63
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:12,174
Aunt Bedelia is...?

64
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:13,614
Never mind, my dears.

65
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:17,346
The point is Bedelia loved
her rather elderly beau...

66
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:19,920
...and her own father had him murdered!

67
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:25,251
Yarbro was the guy's name
and he supposedly died...

68
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,721
...in a "hunting accident."

69
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,794
That's what's on the books, anyway.

70
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,063
For Bedelia, it was the last straw.

71
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:37,864
She bashed her father's head in
with a marble ashtray.

72
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,642
So rumor has it.

73
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,877
Well, however it happened...

74
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:48,348
...it was good riddance
to some extremely bad rubbish.

75
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,348
And my lovely niece
and my handsome nephew...

76
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,582
...have very good reasons
for being pleased...

77
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,090
...by old Nathan's death.

78
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:57,251
There was no trouble about the will.

79
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,056
Share and share alike.

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,732
And now...

81
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:08,464
...every Father's Day,
every single Father's Day since his death...

82
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:11,864
...for seven long years,
she returns to this house.

83
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,937
The "scene of the crime. "

84
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,379
-ls that--
-Oh, yes.

85
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:20,307
You can almost set your watch by her.

86
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,450
"Screech to a halt," as they say.

87
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,222
Do you think she really did it?

88
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,280
Oh, yes.

89
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,591
l know she did.

90
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:37,156
Bedelia was always very unstable,
even when she was much younger.

91
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,694
After the death of her gentleman friend,
she grew steadily worse.

92
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,499
Why Father's Day?

93
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:47,566
Because that was the day of the tragedy.

94
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:50,112
And she is overwhelmed
with her own guilt.

95
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:55,614
She will go to her father's grave
and meditate for about an hour.

96
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:59,520
Then she will come inside
and we'll all sit down...

97
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,819
...to a nice baked ham dinner.

98
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,057
The three of us--

99
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,988
l'm so sorry, Henry...

100
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:07,986
...the four of us...

101
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:11,664
...who now owe her so very much.

102
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,397
I want my cake!

103
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:57,943
Where's my cake, Bedelia?

104
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:03,950
Where's my Father's Day cake?

105
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:07,950
I want my cake...

106
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:10,856
...you dirty bitch!

107
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:14,024
I'm going to have it!

108
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,297
lt's Father's Day!

109
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,736
Where's my cake?

110
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,204
You promised me my cake.

111
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,113
l'm your father and you're supposed to be
taking care of me!

112
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:36,911
l don't hear you! l said, l don't hear you!

113
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,352
You bitch!

114
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:43,088
What do you think l've got you here for?

115
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:46,590
You're just like all the others.

116
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,663
You're nothing but a bunch of vultures!

117
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,931
l want my cake.

118
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:00,838
Bedelia!

119
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:05,077
Where's my Father's Day cake?

120
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:10,083
Happy Father's Day!

121
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,317
Happy Father's Day.

122
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,299
l didn't know l had it in me!

123
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,134
l'm your daughter, right? You bootlegger.

124
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:02,603
Killer! Murderer!

125
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:04,840
Ungrateful bastard.

126
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:13,107
You shouldn't have killed Yarbro!

127
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,750
He was a man, a real man!

128
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:19,020
Everything l wanted, he wanted for me!

129
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:23,414
You stupid bastard! You screwed it all up.

130
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:26,189
You screwed up my mother,
you screwed me up.

131
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,695
You got me so mad, you drove me crazy.

132
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,663
"l want my cake, Bedelia, you bitch! "

133
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,038
You called me a bitch!

134
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,739
Sylvia fixed it all.

135
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,179
Ashtray back in place.

136
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:46,913
Chair overturned.

137
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:52,177
A fall, Daddy, a bad fall.

138
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,720
Nobody could catch us!

139
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,779
Nobody!

140
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,789
You taught me, you taught Sylvia!

141
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,259
You taught us all!

142
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:16,810
So peaceful here.

143
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:31,691
Where's my cake, Bedelia?

144
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:36,963
l want my cake!

145
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:46,465
lt's Father's Day, Bedelia!

146
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,905
l want my cake!

147
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:14,034
Cass!

148
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,702
Cass, turn that down!

149
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:21,972
Turn that down
and turn it down right now!

150
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,582
Shall l glaze the ham now?

151
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:35,690
No, Mrs. Danvers, you'll have to wait.

152
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:38,119
Miss Grantham has not yet arrived.

153
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:41,422
And you will remember
that today is a very special day.

154
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:42,690
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,132
Ain't life grand, Mrs. D.?

156
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:51,102
l do hope she's all right.

157
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,901
Sometimes she loses track of time.

158
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,227
Aunt Bedelia?

159
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,501
Miss Grantham, are you around?

160
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:31,554
Where's my cake?

161
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,956
l want it.

162
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,822
lt's mine.

163
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,750
Where is he?

164
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,949
My dear, l really couldn't say.

165
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:07,894
No doubt he's still out at the grave,
hobnobbing with your Aunt Bedelia...

166
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,364
...getting her side of the story l expect.

167
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:11,798
Well, l want him.

168
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,161
And l want my dinner. l'm hungry.

169
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:16,132
Go get him then.

170
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:19,539
You go, Richard.

171
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,142
He's your husband.

172
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,810
l don't even like him.

173
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:25,369
l'll go and get him.

174
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,777
After all, he's such a sweet boy.

175
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,124
Mrs. Danvers?

176
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,362
Mrs. Danvers!

177
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,145
Mrs. Danvers!

178
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:18,195
l want my cake.

179
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:38,414
Where is she?

180
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,551
And where the hell is Hank?

181
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:43,889
Go see, Richard. Please.

182
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,749
Please.

183
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:47,920
Look, my darling sister...

184
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,721
...he's your hick....

185
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:53,166
Husband, l mean. You go look for him.

186
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:56,170
Richard, l'm scared and it's dark out there!

187
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:59,367
l just want some more wine, okay?

188
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,907
Please, Richard!

189
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:06,871
All right. Come on.

190
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,273
Come on!

191
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,589
Are we conserving energy?

192
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:42,847
lt's Father's Day!

193
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:46,348
And l got my cake!

194
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:51,019
Happy Father's Day!

195
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,053
Holy Jesus!

196
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,038
That's a meteor!

197
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:46,775
l'll be dipped in shit if that ain't a meteor!

198
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,047
l wonder how much they'd pay for it
at the college?

199
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:24,184
I wonder how much they'd pay for it
at the college?

200
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:35,555
Damn fine one, Mr. Verrill!

201
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,300
How does $50 sound?

202
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,239
Not a cent less than $200!

203
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,072
$75?

204
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,372
$200.

205
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,941
My mother didn't raise idiots!

206
00:22:57,453 --> 00:22:58,784
Keep on counting.

207
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,155
Not a cent less than $200.

208
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:04,119
My meteor, my price!

209
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,291
l can pay off my bank loan!

210
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:10,764
That's the ticket.

211
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:14,195
Got to cool the son of a bitch off.

212
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,803
You done it now, Jordy Verrill!

213
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:57,640
You nunkhead!

214
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,348
Nunkhead! Nunkhead!

215
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:03,207
$200...

216
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:06,010
...for a broken meteor?

217
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:09,217
Mr. Verrill, you must be joking!

218
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,960
l wouldn't give you two cents!

219
00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:15,928
Jordy Verrill, you nunkhead!

220
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:18,132
Verrill luck's always in.

221
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,760
And you spell that kind of luck, B-A-D!

222
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:26,134
Still, l got to try.

223
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:50,591
Meteor shit!

224
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,574
Maybe l can glue it together
in the morning.

225
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,049
Jesus Christ.

226
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,950
l'm sorry, Mr. Verrill.

227
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:52,577
These fingers have...

228
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:55,856
...got to come off.

229
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:26,477
This is going to be extremely painful,
Mr. Verrill.

230
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,338
Jordy Verrill...

231
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,474
...you nunkhead!

232
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,254
Boy, don't it itch!

233
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,230
Well, that's Verrill luck, all right.

234
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:45,999
Always in.

235
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,934
Always bad!

236
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:51,435
But there is a difference
between dreaming and doing.

237
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,939
The dreamersjust sit...

238
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:55,738
...and moon about how wonderful
it would be...

239
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:57,904
...if only things were different.

240
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:01,381
And the years roll on and they grow old.

241
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,245
By and by, they forget everything...

242
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:06,116
...even about their dreams.

243
00:29:06,188 --> 00:29:09,123
I don't want to be like that.
I want to be somebody.

244
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,658
Everyone laughed at us,
as they did at all the other pioneers.

245
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:15,697
They said America would never
be anything but a wilderness.

246
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:17,391
We didn't believe that.

247
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:19,864
We were going to make a new country.

248
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:23,668
Besides, we wanted to see
our dreams come true.

249
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,174
Grandma, it must have been wonderful!

250
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:28,231
It was.

251
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:33,104
But don't you think for one single minute
that it was easy.

252
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,375
We burned in summer
and we froze in winter.

253
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:39,414
But we kept right on going
and didn't complain.

254
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:42,045
Because we were doing
what we wanted to do!

255
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:44,419
Can you understand that?

256
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,690
No!

257
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,054
No, no!

258
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,746
There you are, you sucker!
l knew you were in here some place!

259
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:23,595
Our next program, Let There Be Light.

260
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:29,569
Many ofyou have made
the great breakthrough...

261
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,765
...one giant step, the faith decision.

262
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,033
l needed that!

263
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:36,441
You then said, "My troubles are over!"

264
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:38,570
Not true!

265
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:41,104
Look up!

266
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,949
Lift up your head!

267
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:45,179
You will succeed!

268
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:48,714
Be confident of this one thing!

269
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,450
That God, who has begun
a good thing in you...

270
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,819
...will complete it!

271
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:56,662
Prerecorded.

272
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:04,865
l'm growing!

273
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,531
Oh, my God! What a dream!

274
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,292
Oh, no!

275
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:07,560
Not there!

276
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:10,531
Jordy?

277
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:12,073
Daddy?

278
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:13,735
Jordy!

279
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:20,646
But you're dead.

280
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,642
You've been dead...

281
00:32:26,188 --> 00:32:28,122
...Christ, three years almost!

282
00:32:28,623 --> 00:32:31,285
You ain't going to get
into that tub, are you?

283
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:36,322
lt's the water that it wants, Jordy!

284
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,689
Don't you know that?

285
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,860
You get into that water, Jordy...

286
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,997
...you might as well sign
your death warrant.

287
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:48,333
l'm a goner already, Daddy, ain't l?

288
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,809
l got the stuff from out of that meteor
on me....

289
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:56,080
And l'm gone.

290
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:57,974
Ain't l?

291
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:00,488
Daddy?

292
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:06,194
Daddy?

293
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,516
Oh, better!

294
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,552
Oh, that's much better!

295
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,594
And now, it's time for the Farm Report.

296
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:49,830
Sponsored by Granger Farm Supply...

297
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:52,934
...the home of all your feed
and farm supplies.

298
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:57,034
Grain prices closed,
having risen most of the session...

299
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:59,478
...in reaction to positive export news.

300
00:34:22,037 --> 00:34:24,028
Please, please?

301
00:34:25,473 --> 00:34:27,031
Please, God...

302
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,834
...let my luck be in!

303
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,941
Just this once.

304
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:36,745
Please, God...

305
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:39,385
...just this once!

306
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:45,654
And in today's weather...

307
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:50,254
...not much for the outdoor types,
but you farmers are going to love this!

308
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,326
The current 30-day forecast...

309
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,301
...released by the meteorological station
at Portland...

310
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,396
...calls for moderating temperatures
and lots of rain!

311
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,335
Castle County is going to turn green
so fast in the next month...

312
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,935
...that it's going to be almost miraculous!

313
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:38,938
Wentworth?

314
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:42,039
All right, all right!

315
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,254
-Wentworth?
-All right, l said!

316
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,801
That may work on TV, mister,
but l can bench-press 300 pounds.

317
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,306
Get your foot out of my door,
or you'll lose about half of it!

318
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:08,504
Don't call me "mister"!
You know damn well who l am!

319
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,271
Let's not play any games.

320
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,471
Get out of here!

321
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:13,446
Listen to me carefully, Harry.

322
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:15,616
Unless you let me in and talk to me...

323
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:18,744
...something very nasty will happen
to Rebecca.

324
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:21,681
So nasty...

325
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,424
...that your little mind
can barely conceive of it.

326
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,666
You've found out. All right.

327
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:37,004
Becky and l were going
to tell you pretty soon anyway.

328
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,131
Some of these cables are loose, Harry.

329
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:43,200
l'm surprised you didn't notice a change
in the quality of your picture.

330
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,382
You ought to be grateful to us.

331
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,351
lf you ever loved her, you don't now.

332
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:57,589
There won't be any alimony
or property settlement problems.

333
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:58,819
She just wants out.

334
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:02,624
l don't know whether l ever loved her
or not, Harry. That doesn't matter.

335
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:04,790
The point is l keep what is mine.

336
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,125
No exception to that rule, ever!

337
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,067
No exceptions, Harry.

338
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:12,562
Never!

339
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:19,878
What did you mean when you said
something nasty would happen?

340
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:22,644
You really should take better care
of this equipment.

341
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:25,015
At least get a maintenance cartridge.

342
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,047
Talk to me! Right now!

343
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,289
Take your hand off me, right now!

344
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:34,150
Fine.

345
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,464
l've got something l want you to hear.

346
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:43,504
Harry!

347
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:45,365
He's got me in....

348
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:47,735
Please, come!

349
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,699
Please!

350
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:51,844
He's got me in....

351
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:54,277
Ifyou don't come, the....

352
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:56,445
Please, Harry!

353
00:37:56,718 --> 00:37:58,117
Please, come!

354
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,051
l had to stop it there.
l couldn't bear to record any more.

355
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:04,054
What have you done with her?

356
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,592
Tell me, you son of a bitch, or l'll kill you!

357
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,630
Kill me and you'll never find out!

358
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:11,255
Now, don't get naughty.

359
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,859
lf l fall down on this floor
and hit my head on that hard marble...

360
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,300
...l could fracture my skull.

361
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:19,602
-Fine with me!
-Then you'll never know!

362
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:22,609
And believe me, Mr. True Love,
you'll want to know!

363
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:25,978
Because by 1 1 :00 this morning,
it will be too late.

364
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,011
I love the ocean,
except when the tide is out.

365
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:37,649
Then it has that kind of rotten smell.

366
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:41,127
l just don't understand
what you're trying to prove.

367
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,723
l'm not trying to prove a thing.

368
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,663
lt may be on some subjects
that l'm not entirely sane.

369
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:53,368
The subject of what is mine,
for example, l'm not sane...

370
00:38:53,675 --> 00:38:54,767
...at all!

371
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,885
This is Comfort Point.

372
00:39:15,964 --> 00:39:18,296
l call my beach house Comfort Station.

373
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:21,498
ls that camp or kitsch, Harry?

374
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:22,831
That's stupid!

375
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:25,197
That's unkind, Harry!

376
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:26,596
Unkind!

377
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:31,675
l won't hold it against you.

378
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:33,637
Come on, up this way.

379
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:39,820
Harry!

380
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:43,221
Maiden-fair is waiting
for her knight in shining corduroy.

381
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:44,814
Come on.

382
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,526
Here's something l think
you'll find interesting.

383
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,294
You see that down there?

384
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:55,762
ls that...?

385
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:57,569
What?

386
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:01,266
The burial mound of my lady-fair?

387
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:05,806
lt could be.

388
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:23,687
Notice how the water creeps in?

389
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:25,723
Even when the tide is out...

390
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,427
...the water creeps in.

391
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:30,003
l don't know what you think you're doing!

392
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,142
This has gone just about far enough!

393
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,446
No, Harry. Not nearly far enough!

394
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,950
Now, if you're thinking
of becoming a hero...

395
00:40:44,018 --> 00:40:46,612
...l suggest that you remember
the lady-fair.

396
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:52,993
Jump into that hole.

397
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,533
Then you force me to shoot you, Harry.

398
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,707
Sorry.

399
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:21,011
Good boy, Harry.

400
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:30,391
Now, Harry, l want you to kneel down...

401
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:33,926
...and start pulling the sand into the hole.

402
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:38,928
No way! Go ahead,
shoot me if you want to.

403
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:41,999
-You're not going to bury me alive!
-Not a bad idea.

404
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,708
Not exactly what l had in mind though.

405
00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:48,513
All l want to do is incapacitate you,
then you can see Becky.

406
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,582
l don't believe you.

407
00:41:53,654 --> 00:41:55,383
l always keep my promises.

408
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,815
And l do have the gun, don't l?

409
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:01,423
Help!

410
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:03,361
Yell all you want, Harry!

411
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:07,261
Comfort Point is very private! l own it all!

412
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,460
Help!

413
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:09,863
Help! Help!

414
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:11,835
Help!

415
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:15,198
Nobody will hear you.

416
00:42:16,344 --> 00:42:18,073
Nobody will hear anything!

417
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:24,645
Now, do what l told you!

418
00:42:52,346 --> 00:42:55,179
Sort of like being buried
in wet cement, eh?

419
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,345
You can't move your arms.

420
00:42:57,819 --> 00:42:59,650
You don't have any leverage.

421
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:02,148
Go ahead, try to move.

422
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,298
l could really...

423
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,266
...cover you all the way up,
couldn't l, Harry?

424
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:21,902
l could make Harry all gone!

425
00:43:25,046 --> 00:43:26,411
Oh, no! No, no.

426
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:28,782
l wouldn't do that.

427
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:32,482
Here, let me get that out of you.

428
00:43:32,587 --> 00:43:34,418
There you are. That's good.

429
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:36,580
No, l keep my promises.

430
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,591
Get out.

431
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,530
Get out of here! Jesus!

432
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:51,093
Richard!

433
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:56,810
Get it out of here!

434
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,139
Found a friend, Harry?

435
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:05,041
"l'm just wild about Harry"

436
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:07,151
Come on, Richard.

437
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:08,688
Get it out of here!

438
00:44:08,956 --> 00:44:10,685
He's just getting revenge.

439
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:15,685
For all of the relatives of his that you ate,
baked and stuffed at Ma Maison!

440
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,462
Bad fellow! You bad fellow!

441
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:20,157
Get away!

442
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:31,011
Money!

443
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:33,046
Look, l have money!

444
00:44:34,248 --> 00:44:37,115
l'll give you anything!
Just get me out of this hole!

445
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:38,880
l have something here...

446
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:42,252
...that will take your mind off of it.

447
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:45,916
lt's showtime!

448
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:52,065
Becky?

449
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:54,601
lsn't this a great video?

450
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:55,727
l love this!

451
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,998
Look at the quality of that picture!

452
00:44:58,406 --> 00:44:59,498
Somebody!

453
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,629
Becky?

454
00:45:01,776 --> 00:45:02,765
Becky!

455
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:04,711
She can't hear you!

456
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:08,678
l'm sorry. She lost the coin toss.
l had to bury her further down the beach.

457
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:11,775
Couldn't even leave her a monitor.
Would have shorted out by now.

458
00:45:11,852 --> 00:45:13,513
No, no! That's a trick!

459
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:15,615
You son of a bitch!

460
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,748
That's some kind of special-effects trick,
isn't it?

461
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:21,054
Just look at the VCR back there....

462
00:45:21,362 --> 00:45:23,353
l'm sorry. You can't turn your head.

463
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:27,026
Let me assure you the VCR is not on PLAY,
it's on RECORD.

464
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:28,759
l'm going to save this stuff!

465
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:30,895
Two of you are part of my home movies!

466
00:45:30,972 --> 00:45:32,234
You're insane!

467
00:45:33,074 --> 00:45:34,336
lt won't be long now.

468
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:35,773
Not long at all.

469
00:45:35,977 --> 00:45:37,103
Oh, my God!

470
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:39,870
You are insane.

471
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:42,643
l kept my promise
that you would see Becky again.

472
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:44,014
ls that insane?

473
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:47,847
You bastard!

474
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:50,049
There's a chance you can get out of this.

475
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:51,989
The tide might even set you free.

476
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:56,052
lt depends on how long you keep your cool,
how long you hold your breath.

477
00:45:57,331 --> 00:45:58,855
The water is so cold!

478
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,724
So salty.

479
00:46:01,035 --> 00:46:03,196
You're underneath, holding your breath...

480
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:06,206
...waiting for the wave that's covering you
to go back out...

481
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:09,175
...so that you can snatch a quick breath...

482
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:13,572
...before the next wave comes in!

483
00:46:17,752 --> 00:46:20,687
You have a chance, Harry,
if you don't lose your head.

484
00:46:20,755 --> 00:46:22,689
lt looks like she's losing hers!

485
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:23,985
Oh, God! No!

486
00:46:26,761 --> 00:46:30,094
Feel how hard your heart is beating, Harry?

487
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:32,121
How fast?

488
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:35,925
That will make it harder
for you to hold your breath.

489
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:43,604
Oh, the tide.

490
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,347
lt's coming in.

491
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:52,508
lt's getting late, Harry.
l'll have to prod along now.

492
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,112
Wait!

493
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:56,513
But you enjoy the show.

494
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,722
At least until the monitor shorts out.

495
00:46:59,794 --> 00:47:01,785
All right! Come on! Stop it!

496
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:05,029
Sorry, Harry. l really can't stay.

497
00:47:08,469 --> 00:47:09,800
Come back here!

498
00:47:28,322 --> 00:47:30,381
Oh, God! Harry!

499
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:21,886
Oh, my God.

500
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:38,233
Richard!

501
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:46,614
I'm going to get you!
Do you hear me, Richard?

502
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:49,753
Do you hear me, Richard? I'll get you!

503
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:53,158
You have to hold your breath.

504
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:58,664
You have to hold your breath!

505
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:53,783
The current pulled him out.

506
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,232
That's what happened.

507
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:21,874
Current pulled him out. He's gone.

508
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,009
Richard!

509
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:26,273
Now, let me see, where is...?

510
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:31,845
lf that damn maid has been moving
my stuff again, l swear l'll--

511
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:33,008
Richard?

512
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:10,620
The undertow has carried them away
and saved me the trouble.

513
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:22,432
Come out of it!

514
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,070
No need to get jumpy.

515
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:38,147
They're all gone, blub-blub-blub.

516
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:39,869
Who's out there?

517
00:56:50,117 --> 00:56:51,209
Wentworth?

518
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:58,250
ls that you, Wentworth?

519
00:56:59,993 --> 00:57:02,621
May l remind you, dear boy, l have the gun.

520
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,392
Wentworth?

521
00:57:08,568 --> 00:57:10,559
l suggest you get out of here...

522
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:13,262
...or l'll shoot you!

523
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:16,737
Fair warning!

524
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:18,603
Wentworth?

525
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:20,379
l'll shoot you dead!

526
00:57:27,421 --> 00:57:29,218
Get out of here, Wentworth!

527
00:57:42,336 --> 00:57:45,032
You can't shoot us...

528
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,037
...dead, Richard.

529
00:57:47,341 --> 00:57:51,107
Because we're already dead!

530
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:56,046
We want to see you, Richard!

531
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:58,480
We want to see you, Richard!

532
00:57:58,552 --> 00:58:00,543
We want to see you, Richard!

533
00:58:01,288 --> 00:58:03,119
We want to see you, Richard!

534
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:06,786
We dug a hole for you, Richard.

535
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:09,056
On the beach.

536
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:11,687
Below the high-tide line!

537
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:15,558
Here we come!

538
00:58:16,069 --> 00:58:18,697
"lt's showtime! "

539
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:24,140
Here we come, Richard!

540
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:28,305
Let's go to the beach.

541
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:32,875
We just want you to come to the beach.

542
00:58:34,221 --> 00:58:35,518
Come with us.

543
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,517
Come down to the beach.

544
00:59:02,883 --> 00:59:05,545
lf you don't panic....

545
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,582
lf you can hold your breath....

546
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:14,286
lf you can hold your breath....

547
00:59:17,998 --> 00:59:21,092
lf you can hold your breath....

548
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:24,560
lf you can hold your breath....

549
00:59:36,716 --> 00:59:39,708
l can hold my breath...

550
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,652
...for a long time!

551
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,894
Look at that!

552
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:30,501
What the devil...?

553
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:57,123
Dexter, you are such a child!

554
01:00:57,297 --> 01:00:59,857
You and Henry both are such children.

555
01:01:00,634 --> 01:01:03,831
But at least Henry has me
to take care of him. Don't you, dear?

556
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:05,462
Tabby, Richard...

557
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:07,666
...l'd like you to meet Dexter Stanley...

558
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:10,574
...our distinguished professor
in the zoology department.

559
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:14,406
They're both new here
in the math department.

560
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:16,881
How do you do?
What a lovely name you have.

561
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,577
Actually, it's Tabitha.

562
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:22,317
-Pleasure to meet you, Professor Stanley.
-Just Dex will do.

563
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:24,252
This is Henry and Wilma Northrup.

564
01:01:24,324 --> 01:01:26,485
Just call me Billie. Everyone does.

565
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,527
You need anyone to show you the ropes,
hon, just come see me.

566
01:01:31,164 --> 01:01:32,961
l know all the best stores.

567
01:01:34,267 --> 01:01:35,632
Nice to meet you.

568
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:38,098
Are you buying or renting?

569
01:01:38,238 --> 01:01:39,728
We're renting at the moment.

570
01:01:39,806 --> 01:01:41,034
lt's just as well.

571
01:01:41,107 --> 01:01:44,167
Buying real estate in a college town is
a pain in the ass.

572
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:45,541
Take my word for it.

573
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:48,046
Henry is in the English department.
And Wilma....

574
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:51,174
l just take care of Henry.
Believe me, he needs it.

575
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:54,246
Did you ever meet a man who didn't?

576
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:56,815
You're not drinking?

577
01:01:56,923 --> 01:01:58,686
Actually, we just got here.

578
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:00,749
Well, we can take care of that.

579
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:02,453
Just come with me.

580
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:04,326
Stay here until l get back.

581
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:15,670
These people are dry. Take care of them.
They don't know what they're doing.

582
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:29,215
And if Dexter hadn't had his teeth capped,
he'd have been out on his ass years ago.

583
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:32,254
So when Parker told me
that l was out of line...

584
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,220
...l told him he ought to get laid.

585
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:39,196
"Parker," l said, "if you'd just have
your ashes hauled...

586
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:43,100
"...you wouldn't have to spend
all this time playing Emily Vanderbilt! "

587
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:44,966
Or Emily Van Buren...

588
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,739
...whoever that etiquette crotch is!

589
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,899
Excuse me.

590
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:51,776
l don't know why they keep inviting her!

591
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:07,854
How about tonight?
Maybe we could do it tonight?

592
01:03:10,096 --> 01:03:11,290
That would be great.

593
01:03:11,364 --> 01:03:13,730
All right, l'll call you about it.

594
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:19,236
l gather you'll be unavailable
for chess tonight.

595
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:26,276
Henry, l'm just about reaching
a point where l--

596
01:03:26,513 --> 01:03:29,141
Pardon me. Would one
of you be Professor Stanley?

597
01:03:29,215 --> 01:03:30,079
Yes, l am.

598
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,381
-There is a telephone call for you.
-All right. Thank you.

599
01:03:34,954 --> 01:03:37,684
Probably be Charlie again
with his damn ear mites.

600
01:03:37,757 --> 01:03:39,884
He'll get the Nobel Prize before he's 20!

601
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:42,484
Especially if he's working
at Amberson Hall in August.

602
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:44,689
No, he's downstairs. lt's cooler.

603
01:03:48,435 --> 01:03:50,460
Yeah, sure, l'll come tonight.

604
01:03:50,737 --> 01:03:51,704
Well, thanks.

605
01:03:51,771 --> 01:03:53,762
Hey, what are friends for?

606
01:03:54,207 --> 01:03:55,606
Just call me Billie.

607
01:03:55,675 --> 01:03:56,937
Everyone does.

608
01:04:03,383 --> 01:04:06,375
l thought l should call you anyway,
see what you thought.

609
01:04:07,754 --> 01:04:09,551
Did Charlie tell you l was here?

610
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:11,817
Yeah. I sent him out for a hamburger.

611
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:13,218
l had to insist.

612
01:04:13,293 --> 01:04:16,262
That kid doesn't know if it's night or day
when he gets going.

613
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:18,058
Yes, he's very dedicated.

614
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:20,289
l'm willing to bet that crate...

615
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:24,360
...is full ol National Geographics
or back issues of the Reader's Digest.

616
01:04:25,205 --> 01:04:27,696
The date on it said 1834.

617
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:31,472
Did they publish a Reader's Digest
way back then?

618
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,179
1834? Really?

619
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:37,609
Yes, it's stenciled right on the side.

620
01:04:37,684 --> 01:04:40,244
June 19, 1834.

621
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:43,950
And then something
about an "Arctic Expedition."

622
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:48,284
There may be something more interesting
in your crate than periodicals after all.

623
01:04:58,204 --> 01:05:01,867
...because everyone in the department
is looking to put the knife in you.

624
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:05,502
l mean, some of these
so-called "academics"...

625
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:08,971
...make the shark in Jaws
look like fucking Flipper!

626
01:05:09,048 --> 01:05:09,980
Wilma!

627
01:05:10,049 --> 01:05:12,244
Your husband is calling you, Billie.

628
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:14,712
Oh, God, Henry! What's wrong now?

629
01:05:16,556 --> 01:05:18,023
Not a thing, Wilma.

630
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:21,321
Everything is just fine.

631
01:05:36,509 --> 01:05:37,771
Hell of a shot.

632
01:05:37,844 --> 01:05:38,936
Bull's-eye.

633
01:05:39,646 --> 01:05:41,807
Henry, can't you do anything right?

634
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:43,345
Huh?

635
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,577
"Huh?" That's what l figured!

636
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:48,476
That is just what l would expect from you!

637
01:05:49,088 --> 01:05:51,886
l told you half an hour ago
to get one of them...

638
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:55,160
...kids in the monkey suits
to bring the car around!

639
01:05:55,428 --> 01:05:56,690
Oh, l'm sorry.

640
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:01,099
You are such a little kid.

641
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:03,093
l swear to God you are.

642
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,603
Where would you be without me
to take care of you?

643
01:06:13,379 --> 01:06:18,009
l still think your crate is full
of old magazines and just plain junk.

644
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:22,821
lt's chained though.

645
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:24,579
"Arctic Expedition."

646
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:27,154
And that date!

647
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:30,887
lt kind of gets you, doesn't it?

648
01:06:31,898 --> 01:06:33,422
Yes, it kind of does.

649
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:36,524
Got it.

650
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:39,133
lt's kind of heavy.

651
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:40,866
l'll just swing this in.

652
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:47,743
Let's set it down over here.

653
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:50,349
l'm surprised that you didn't
open it yourself.

654
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:52,407
No, l figured that was for you.

655
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:54,717
Why didn't you tell Charlie?

656
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:56,617
He's just a grad student.

657
01:06:57,423 --> 01:07:01,257
And with Professor Tirrell being in England,
l figure you're the boss.

658
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:09,529
Hold this on it.

659
01:07:14,674 --> 01:07:16,335
What made you look under here?

660
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:18,468
l flipped a quarter trying to decide...

661
01:07:18,545 --> 01:07:22,276
...if l should buff the second-floor hallway
first or wash the lab windows.

662
01:07:22,348 --> 01:07:24,179
But when it came down, l missed it.

663
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,979
Then it rolled under here.

664
01:07:28,688 --> 01:07:30,019
Oh! There it is.

665
01:07:32,959 --> 01:07:37,362
l probably would have let it go, only it was
my last quarter for the Coke machine.

666
01:07:41,301 --> 01:07:43,201
lt's not very nice in there, is it?

667
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:45,134
God, l hate tight places!

668
01:07:50,343 --> 01:07:52,038
-Are you okay, Doc?
-Yeah.

669
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:10,052
Help me out with this, will you?

670
01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:12,654
l think we might really have
something here.

671
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:43,187
What's wrong?

672
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:45,696
lt felt like something shifted in there.

673
01:08:46,566 --> 01:08:48,796
Did you feel it when we set it on the table?

674
01:08:48,868 --> 01:08:51,769
l did feel something under the stairs.
lt felt heavy.

675
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:55,330
Yeah, but it seemed like something moved
on its own.

676
01:08:56,709 --> 01:08:59,678
lf there ever really were
any living specimens in there...

677
01:08:59,746 --> 01:09:03,375
...l doubt if they're feeling very lively
after 147 years.

678
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:10,078
l must be spending too much time
in the sun.

679
01:09:10,657 --> 01:09:12,591
Let's get this open, shall we?

680
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:15,886
l got a hammer and chisel in the closet.

681
01:09:15,962 --> 01:09:17,896
Just wait while l go get them.

682
01:09:18,297 --> 01:09:19,764
Turn the lights on.

683
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:31,639
And don't just leave the pots soaking
like you did last time!

684
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:33,611
Scrub them and put them away!

685
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,440
Just because you
and your intellectual friend...

686
01:09:36,516 --> 01:09:40,350
...are going to play chess, doesn't mean
you have to leave a mess for me.

687
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:43,852
Wipe the stove!

688
01:09:44,824 --> 01:09:45,848
Yes, Billie.

689
01:09:45,925 --> 01:09:49,588
And kindly have him out of here
before l get back from my classes.

690
01:09:51,064 --> 01:09:54,363
Frankly, that tobacco he smokes
makes me want to vomit!

691
01:09:58,871 --> 01:09:59,997
Yes, Billie.

692
01:10:03,509 --> 01:10:05,238
"Yes, Billie. Yes, Billie."

693
01:10:08,948 --> 01:10:10,813
What would you do without me?

694
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,874
l don't know, Billie.

695
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:18,622
Well, on that we're even.

696
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:21,991
Enjoy your chess.

697
01:10:31,003 --> 01:10:32,937
l bet they're worth something.

698
01:10:36,909 --> 01:10:39,400
Be my guest, Mike. lt's your find.

699
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:42,071
There's probably nothing in there...

700
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:45,311
...but some rocks and plants
that'll turn to dust if we touch them.

701
01:10:45,384 --> 01:10:47,648
But l'm pretty hot to see, just the same.

702
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,711
To tell you the truth, so am l.

703
01:10:51,224 --> 01:10:52,623
lt's loosening up.

704
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:03,356
l can't see a damn thing!

705
01:12:04,463 --> 01:12:06,488
Where did l leave my flashlight?

706
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:10,860
Never mind. Let's just get the last nail
out of here.

707
01:12:14,974 --> 01:12:16,373
Did you hear that?

708
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:22,844
There's something in there!

709
01:12:25,251 --> 01:12:26,616
Something shiny!

710
01:12:28,754 --> 01:12:30,278
Looks like a couple of emeralds!

711
01:12:30,356 --> 01:12:31,345
Don't!

712
01:12:33,593 --> 01:12:34,821
Help me, Doc!

713
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,254
lt's biting!

714
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:39,229
Help!

715
01:13:52,138 --> 01:13:54,072
Professor Stanley, what is it?

716
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,198
The janitor!

717
01:13:55,274 --> 01:13:58,937
The crate! lt was going to attack me!

718
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:00,769
Professor, slow down!

719
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,244
We have to get the campus security!

720
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,785
Professor Stanley, slow down!

721
01:14:07,386 --> 01:14:09,752
l don't know what you're talking about!

722
01:14:11,657 --> 01:14:13,648
lt's the janitor!

723
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:16,593
-You know Mike, the janitor?
-Yes, of course l do.

724
01:14:47,193 --> 01:14:49,286
lt just sucked him in!

725
01:14:51,497 --> 01:14:53,965
That's pretty far out, Professor Stanley.

726
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,265
But it's true! l swear, it's true!

727
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:57,927
Let's get the campus police!

728
01:14:58,004 --> 01:15:00,268
No! The campus security is no good!

729
01:15:02,608 --> 01:15:06,374
lf l'm having trouble swallowing this,
what the fuck will they think?

730
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:12,773
l don't know what they would think.

731
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:15,952
They'd think you had been off
on a hell of a toot.

732
01:15:19,325 --> 01:15:22,260
They'd think that we'd both been off
on a hell of a toot!

733
01:15:22,328 --> 01:15:25,422
Seeing Tasmanian devils
instead of pink elephants.

734
01:15:26,298 --> 01:15:28,994
l think l'll go down...

735
01:15:30,336 --> 01:15:32,065
...and see how the land lays.

736
01:15:32,138 --> 01:15:33,935
No! Don't! lt may be out!

737
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,040
l doubt that.

738
01:15:36,175 --> 01:15:37,938
Charlie, please, don't go there!

739
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:40,103
Be right back, Professor Stanley.

740
01:15:44,817 --> 01:15:46,045
He'll see it.

741
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:49,050
He'll see the crate, he'll see the blood!
He'll see Mike!

742
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:50,816
And then he'll believe me!

743
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:56,583
Charlie?

744
01:15:58,898 --> 01:15:59,887
Charlie!

745
01:16:07,106 --> 01:16:10,007
There! See the blood?
Do you think l'm crazy now?

746
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,412
You think that l killed him?

747
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:19,381
Look at the blood! Look....

748
01:16:21,053 --> 01:16:22,145
lt's gone!

749
01:16:22,221 --> 01:16:23,381
What's gone?

750
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,386
lt got out.

751
01:16:30,396 --> 01:16:33,763
l thought it would be potbound
after all these years, but it got out!

752
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,630
lt pushed the crate off the table!

753
01:16:36,268 --> 01:16:37,735
Look at these tracks!

754
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:46,806
lt pushed the crate back in
under the stairs...

755
01:16:47,413 --> 01:16:49,540
...where it felt safe for so long.

756
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,555
Charlie, l really think--

757
01:17:36,495 --> 01:17:39,726
Charlie, listen, don't go in there!
lf you had seen that thing!

758
01:17:39,798 --> 01:17:40,924
Don't worry.

759
01:17:52,344 --> 01:17:54,869
lt looks like it's been through a hay baler.

760
01:17:55,214 --> 01:17:56,806
Now do you believe me?

761
01:17:59,218 --> 01:18:00,947
Charlie, don't go near it.

762
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,912
l don't want the crate.

763
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:06,088
l want that shoe.

764
01:18:07,026 --> 01:18:09,085
l want to measure the bite marks.

765
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,621
Then maybe we can figure out...

766
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:16,792
...what we're dealing with here.

767
01:19:20,266 --> 01:19:22,826
We have to stop it! We have to stop it!

768
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:27,795
Two people are dead already!
We have to.... Dear God, they died!

769
01:19:29,074 --> 01:19:31,372
Hey, Dex, hold it.

770
01:19:33,646 --> 01:19:34,670
What happened?

771
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:36,942
Two people are dead already, and....

772
01:19:38,317 --> 01:19:39,443
Who's dead?

773
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:41,910
Where's Wilma?

774
01:19:41,987 --> 01:19:44,956
She's gone. Dex, what the hell
happened to you?

775
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:48,385
Two people are dead
and l could be blamed.

776
01:19:49,395 --> 01:19:53,388
l know that's a terrible consideration
at a time like this, Henry, but....

777
01:19:57,303 --> 01:19:58,292
Good God.

778
01:19:59,905 --> 01:20:02,840
The last time l saw someone do that
was in the movies.

779
01:20:02,908 --> 01:20:05,342
lt could be my ass, Henry,
and it wasn't me!

780
01:20:05,411 --> 01:20:08,244
lt was that thing in the crate!

781
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:11,479
l don't even know what it was!

782
01:20:12,484 --> 01:20:13,815
What two people?

783
01:20:13,986 --> 01:20:15,112
Who is dead?

784
01:20:19,191 --> 01:20:21,455
Mike, the janitor in Amberson Hall...

785
01:20:22,494 --> 01:20:24,121
...and Charlie Gereson.

786
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:27,029
He wanted to measure the bite marks!

787
01:20:28,534 --> 01:20:30,263
l guess he got his chance.

788
01:20:31,337 --> 01:20:32,861
He most certainly did!

789
01:20:32,938 --> 01:20:37,534
l can't do anything for you
unless you stop being so damned elliptical.

790
01:20:37,609 --> 01:20:40,510
Now, just slow down,
tell me the whole story...

791
01:20:40,813 --> 01:20:42,440
...from the beginning, all right?

792
01:20:42,514 --> 01:20:45,176
All right. l think l can do that now.

793
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:47,880
Thank God for you, Henry.

794
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:57,590
l thought of some ideas of how
to get rid of it coming over here.

795
01:20:57,663 --> 01:21:00,461
l kept thinking about Ryder's Quarry.
You know the place?

796
01:21:00,532 --> 01:21:01,362
l know it.

797
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:03,458
l think it would be deep enough...

798
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:06,595
...if only there was a way
to get the crate over there.

799
01:21:06,672 --> 01:21:08,833
You know, l kept thinking about it.

800
01:21:10,876 --> 01:21:12,400
l don't know anymore!

801
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:17,409
Am l going crazy, Henry?

802
01:21:18,183 --> 01:21:19,013
No.

803
01:21:22,454 --> 01:21:25,651
l have to use the facilities.

804
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,187
l'll be back in a minute.

805
01:21:29,228 --> 01:21:32,720
Then we'll decide what we need to do.

806
01:21:33,332 --> 01:21:34,321
Thanks.

807
01:21:35,534 --> 01:21:37,195
What are friends for?

808
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:49,140
Let's get you another drink.

809
01:21:49,214 --> 01:21:50,943
No, no. l've had enough.

810
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:54,245
l'm surprised l'm not plastered
out of my gore.

811
01:21:54,486 --> 01:21:55,953
The shock, l guess.

812
01:21:56,021 --> 01:21:59,218
Just one more for the both of us
while we talk this over.

813
01:22:00,392 --> 01:22:01,689
We may need it.

814
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,886
Yeah, okay.

815
01:24:53,432 --> 01:24:54,899
Henry, goddamn it!

816
01:24:55,534 --> 01:24:58,833
How many times have l told you
to lock the goddamn door?

817
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,672
Henry!

818
01:25:09,748 --> 01:25:10,680
Henry?

819
01:25:24,696 --> 01:25:27,358
"Wilma, I've had to leave in a hurry...

820
01:25:27,766 --> 01:25:30,257
"...because of a call from Dexter Stanley.

821
01:25:30,602 --> 01:25:33,935
"He seems to have gotten himself
in a great deal of trouble.

822
01:25:34,506 --> 01:25:36,667
"I'm ashamed to tell you of this...

823
01:25:36,775 --> 01:25:39,175
"...but ever since Dexter's wife died...

824
01:25:39,378 --> 01:25:43,542
"...he's had problems coping
with certain young female grad students.

825
01:25:44,249 --> 01:25:48,515
"He's been able to cover up several
incidents but this one looks very serious.

826
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:55,323
"It seems he got a young woman...

827
01:25:55,394 --> 01:25:58,693
"...to accompany him to Amberson Hall
under false pretenses...

828
01:25:58,764 --> 01:26:00,493
"...and then attacked her.

829
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:06,427
"When Dex called me,
he was barely coherent.

830
01:26:06,638 --> 01:26:10,005
"He was gibbering with fear
and crying, I think.

831
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:15,312
"I tried to get him to tell me
what had happened to the girl.

832
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,441
"But for the most part he kept repeating,
'It's awful, Henry! It's awful!'

833
01:26:21,153 --> 01:26:23,314
"Wilma, could you come out here?

834
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:25,856
"I know it's asking a lot.

835
01:26:25,924 --> 01:26:28,950
"But you're always so clear-headed
about these things.

836
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:30,961
"And you know how to be firm.

837
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:35,663
"I think Dex could use a firmer hand
than mine right now.

838
01:26:36,635 --> 01:26:38,728
"Not to mention the girl herself.

839
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:43,336
"He said that she had curled up
in a dark place and won't come out.

840
01:26:44,609 --> 01:26:49,137
"I'm sorry to have to ask you to come
over to Amberson Hall to help me out...

841
01:26:49,648 --> 01:26:53,948
"...but as you so often say,
what would I do without you?"

842
01:26:54,419 --> 01:26:56,182
What indeed, Henry?

843
01:26:56,354 --> 01:26:57,651
What indeed?

844
01:28:06,892 --> 01:28:07,824
Henry?

845
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:17,033
Henry?

846
01:28:21,773 --> 01:28:23,297
Henry, where are you?

847
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,067
The laboratory, Wilma.

848
01:28:26,912 --> 01:28:28,038
Downstairs.

849
01:28:54,873 --> 01:28:57,467
What are you doing
creeping around down there?

850
01:28:58,844 --> 01:29:00,072
Where is Dex?

851
01:29:00,679 --> 01:29:03,375
What kind of a mess
has he gotten himself into?

852
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:08,613
lt's easier if l just show you, l think.
Come on down.

853
01:29:12,123 --> 01:29:13,249
What's this?

854
01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:15,792
l found them.

855
01:29:19,364 --> 01:29:20,729
Did he beat her?

856
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:26,165
How bad is she? ls she conscious?

857
01:29:37,616 --> 01:29:40,346
lt's easier if you just see
for yourself, Wilma.

858
01:29:43,121 --> 01:29:44,952
What are you laughing about?

859
01:29:46,491 --> 01:29:50,086
Your best friend gets in a scrape with a girl
and you're laughing?

860
01:29:50,462 --> 01:29:52,623
There is a funny side to it, Wilma.

861
01:29:53,365 --> 01:29:56,061
Wait till you see. You'll think so yourself.

862
01:29:57,736 --> 01:30:01,194
You're hysterical, Henry.
Just what l would have expected!

863
01:30:03,074 --> 01:30:05,907
No, l don't think you'll expect this, Wilma.

864
01:30:07,145 --> 01:30:10,239
This is going to be
an entirely new experience.

865
01:30:11,716 --> 01:30:13,843
What are you doing? Let go of me!

866
01:30:16,254 --> 01:30:17,619
What's going on?

867
01:30:17,923 --> 01:30:19,550
The lab's the other way.

868
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:21,216
The lab. Yes, but....

869
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:24,454
The girl is under the stairs, Billie.

870
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:29,256
Wait till you see. That's what's so funny.

871
01:30:29,501 --> 01:30:33,665
The girl has crawled under the stairs
and she won't come out.

872
01:30:34,105 --> 01:30:37,336
She's all curled up there,
you know, like a little baby...

873
01:30:37,943 --> 01:30:39,570
...making funny sounds.

874
01:30:40,312 --> 01:30:41,870
What did he do to her?

875
01:30:46,952 --> 01:30:50,479
You can get her out, Billie.
l know you can get her out.

876
01:30:51,556 --> 01:30:53,547
Why don't you give it a try?

877
01:30:55,193 --> 01:30:58,526
You always know how to handle
these things, Billie.

878
01:30:58,630 --> 01:30:59,824
No problem.

879
01:31:00,699 --> 01:31:01,825
No trouble.

880
01:31:02,767 --> 01:31:04,564
l know you can get her out!

881
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:08,662
What are you doing, Henry?

882
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:12,005
-What are you doing?
-What l should have done a long time ago!

883
01:31:12,077 --> 01:31:13,567
Get in there, Wilma.

884
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:16,509
Just tell it to call you Billie, you bitch!

885
01:31:16,581 --> 01:31:18,845
Stop it! Stop it, Henry, l'll scream!

886
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:22,250
Scream all you want. l'll help you.
Wake up!

887
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:25,384
Wake up, whatever you are!
Wake up, wake up!

888
01:31:25,457 --> 01:31:26,822
Dinnertime!

889
01:31:27,192 --> 01:31:28,420
Poison meat!

890
01:31:28,727 --> 01:31:30,354
Wake up! Wake up!

891
01:31:33,398 --> 01:31:35,696
Wake up! Wake up!

892
01:31:46,978 --> 01:31:48,570
That was great, Henry.

893
01:31:49,014 --> 01:31:52,472
That was just great.
You think this is a Friday night fight?

894
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,647
ls that what you think?

895
01:31:57,389 --> 01:31:59,550
You want to see some real punching?

896
01:32:05,797 --> 01:32:08,823
Same old Henry.
Afraid of your own shadow.

897
01:32:10,268 --> 01:32:13,760
You know what, Henry?
You're a regular barnyard exhibit.

898
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:16,600
Sheep's eyes, chicken guts...

899
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:19,009
...piggy friends...

900
01:32:19,711 --> 01:32:21,303
...and shit for brains.

901
01:32:22,547 --> 01:32:24,708
No good at departmental politics...

902
01:32:25,116 --> 01:32:27,016
...no good at making money...

903
01:32:27,118 --> 01:32:29,746
...no good at making an impression
on anybody!

904
01:32:31,489 --> 01:32:33,855
And no good at all in bed!

905
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,585
When was the last time
you got it up, Henry?

906
01:32:38,296 --> 01:32:41,094
When was the last time
you were a man in our bed?

907
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:45,863
Now, get out of my way, or l swear
you'll be wearing your balls for earrings!

908
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:48,565
l swear to God if you ever touch--

909
01:33:00,552 --> 01:33:02,577
Just tell it to call you Billie.

910
01:35:00,705 --> 01:35:02,730
I didn't see anyone, not a soul.

911
01:35:03,341 --> 01:35:07,641
At this time of the year and no other,
the campus is almost totally deserted.

912
01:35:07,845 --> 01:35:11,838
Summer session is over and fall semester
doesn't start for two more weeks.

913
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:16,316
It was almost hellishly perfect.
I never even saw a pair of headlights.

914
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:19,222
Henry, what did you do with the crate?

915
01:35:20,491 --> 01:35:22,152
That's the beauty of it!

916
01:35:22,227 --> 01:35:25,492
You provided the final piece
in thejigsaw puzzle yourself.

917
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:28,357
The crate is at the bottom
of Ryder's Quarry.

918
01:35:28,967 --> 01:35:32,164
I drove out there with the remains
of three human beings.

919
01:35:32,303 --> 01:35:34,396
Well, two human beings and Wilma.

920
01:35:35,473 --> 01:35:37,873
I began to wonder, where did they go?

921
01:35:38,509 --> 01:35:40,443
I mean, how much could it eat?

922
01:35:42,413 --> 01:35:44,574
I think maybe, at the very end...

923
01:35:45,516 --> 01:35:48,007
...it began to suspect what was happening.

924
01:36:26,591 --> 01:36:29,958
So, the question is: What happens now?

925
01:36:32,597 --> 01:36:35,532
There's no evidence of foul play,
l've seen to that.

926
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:39,330
And there are no bodies.

927
01:36:40,805 --> 01:36:43,569
No. No, l don't suppose there are.

928
01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:48,708
So, what about you, Dexter?

929
01:36:49,781 --> 01:36:51,510
What are you going to say?

930
01:36:55,553 --> 01:36:56,542
Nothing.

931
01:36:58,022 --> 01:37:00,081
Thanks. Thank you, Dexter.

932
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,584
No need to thank me.

933
01:37:04,495 --> 01:37:07,191
After all, what are friends for?

934
01:37:10,268 --> 01:37:13,931
You understand, of course
that l expect to whip your ass at chess...

935
01:37:14,005 --> 01:37:16,496
...twice a week for the rest of our lives.

936
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:19,908
We'll have to see about that, won't we?

937
01:37:29,821 --> 01:37:31,982
l haven't done anything to anybody.

938
01:37:34,359 --> 01:37:35,656
Neither have l.

939
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:41,528
What if l woke up before you got here
and called the police?

940
01:37:43,301 --> 01:37:44,427
You didn't.

941
01:37:48,706 --> 01:37:52,699
What if it gets out, Henry?
What if it gets out of that crate?

942
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,906
lf you saw the way l chained it up,
you wouldn't worry.

943
01:37:59,183 --> 01:38:02,516
That thing has drowned in its box
70 feet down.

944
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:05,479
So, relax.

945
01:38:08,426 --> 01:38:09,358
Relax.

946
01:39:20,932 --> 01:39:21,956
Bastards!

947
01:39:25,903 --> 01:39:27,393
Goddamned bugs.

948
01:39:28,206 --> 01:39:29,673
l'll get them bugs!

949
01:39:30,808 --> 01:39:32,400
l own this goddamned building.

950
01:39:32,477 --> 01:39:35,310
There's not going to be any more
damn bugs!

951
01:39:48,926 --> 01:39:51,759
Heads are going to roll.
l promise you that!

952
01:40:01,372 --> 01:40:02,805
Hello, that you, White?

953
01:40:02,874 --> 01:40:07,004
No, sir, Mr. Pratt. This is George Gendron.
Ijust got off the plane from Seattle.

954
01:40:07,078 --> 01:40:08,909
I have my report ready for typing--

955
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:11,881
The building superintendent
is on vacation, George.

956
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,281
You believe that? Vacation!

957
01:40:15,253 --> 01:40:18,381
l told them l wanted to hear from him
within the hour.

958
01:40:18,589 --> 01:40:20,750
Within the hour, and he now has...

959
01:40:20,892 --> 01:40:23,224
It's 9:34 p.m.

960
01:40:23,528 --> 01:40:25,553
...exactly 26 minutes to go...

961
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:28,929
...or he can stay on vacation permanently!
Bastard.

962
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:32,062
Sir, there was a telex here
in the office from Seattle.

963
01:40:32,136 --> 01:40:33,728
I thought you'd want to hear it.

964
01:40:33,804 --> 01:40:36,295
Why are you at the office at 9:30, George?

965
01:40:37,241 --> 01:40:39,539
There's no overtime at the executive level.

966
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:42,738
Yes, sir, I know that.
It's about the Pacific Aerodyne takeover.

967
01:40:42,813 --> 01:40:45,646
To hell with Pacific Aerodyne!
They're done for.

968
01:40:45,716 --> 01:40:47,547
Norman Castonmeyer is a dinosaur!

969
01:40:47,618 --> 01:40:51,145
He's too fucking blind to find his way
into the nearest tar pit.

970
01:40:51,756 --> 01:40:54,782
The air pollution count is up
to almost seven, George!

971
01:40:55,626 --> 01:40:59,494
People are dying of carbon-monoxide
poisoning and don't even know it.

972
01:41:00,364 --> 01:41:03,060
l found another cockroach
this evening, George.

973
01:41:03,334 --> 01:41:07,737
One of those big ones, right here in
my $3,200-a-month penthouse apartment.

974
01:41:08,406 --> 01:41:10,772
My supposedly germ-proof apartment!

975
01:41:11,242 --> 01:41:14,905
Would you like to tell me, George,
how an apartment can be germ-proof...

976
01:41:14,979 --> 01:41:18,005
...when it's not even bug-proof?

977
01:41:19,984 --> 01:41:21,815
I guess it can't, Mr. Pratt.

978
01:41:21,919 --> 01:41:24,911
But I wanted you to know
that Pratt International now owns...

979
01:41:24,989 --> 01:41:27,389
...the majority of Pacific Aerodyne stock.

980
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:30,256
Of course we do.
l can't talk to you now, George.

981
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:33,897
l'm going to clear up
this cockroach problem once and for all!

982
01:41:45,209 --> 01:41:47,837
l'm not going to have any bugs
in my building.

983
01:41:48,212 --> 01:41:49,474
l loathe bugs.

984
01:41:51,515 --> 01:41:53,881
I realize that, but there's something
you should--

985
01:41:53,951 --> 01:41:56,784
l've got to let you go, George.
You did well!

986
01:41:57,989 --> 01:42:00,253
Go out and fuck somebody.
But wear a damn rubber.

987
01:42:00,324 --> 01:42:02,349
Everybody's got the damn herpes
these days.

988
01:42:02,426 --> 01:42:05,589
Sir, Norman Castonmeyer
shot himself an hour ago.

989
01:42:11,002 --> 01:42:13,562
He did it when it became clear...

990
01:42:13,638 --> 01:42:16,232
...there was no way to stop the takeover.

991
01:42:16,641 --> 01:42:19,132
At least that's what his wife thinks.

992
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:22,771
Wonderful!

993
01:42:23,981 --> 01:42:27,974
Now we won't have to offer the old fart
a seat on the board of directors.

994
01:42:29,053 --> 01:42:30,816
Now, get off the phone, George.

995
01:42:30,888 --> 01:42:33,083
Never run good news into the ground.

996
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:35,854
l've got this bug problem.

997
01:42:37,895 --> 01:42:40,625
Once you get bugs,
you never get rid of them.

998
01:42:41,432 --> 01:42:43,457
They breed in the crawlspaces...

999
01:42:44,568 --> 01:42:46,092
...in the conduits...

1000
01:42:47,171 --> 01:42:49,571
...the very core of the building itself.

1001
01:42:57,548 --> 01:42:58,879
Goodbye, George.

1002
01:42:59,884 --> 01:43:01,875
Yes, sir. Goodnight, Mr. Pratt.

1003
01:43:26,944 --> 01:43:30,311
Once they get a foothold in the building,
you never get rid of them.

1004
01:43:48,199 --> 01:43:49,223
Bastards!

1005
01:43:53,738 --> 01:43:55,069
Reynolds? White?

1006
01:43:56,774 --> 01:43:57,900
Talk to me!

1007
01:43:58,375 --> 01:44:02,277
Ijust called to tell you
what a monster you are, Mr. Pratt...

1008
01:44:03,314 --> 01:44:07,080
...and how I will rejoice
when you're finally dead!

1009
01:44:07,384 --> 01:44:11,047
Lots of people are going to rejoice
when l'm dead. Who are you?

1010
01:44:11,756 --> 01:44:13,587
Lenora Castonmeyer.

1011
01:44:15,626 --> 01:44:19,357
I'm the wife of the man
you murdered this afternoon!

1012
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:21,864
Mrs. Castonmeyer. How are you?

1013
01:44:22,032 --> 01:44:24,159
I hope they keep hell hot for you!

1014
01:44:24,502 --> 01:44:25,764
You son of a bitch!

1015
01:44:25,836 --> 01:44:27,133
I hope they do.

1016
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:30,239
It wasn't enough for you
to drive him to his knees, was it?

1017
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:32,275
No, you had to kill him as well!

1018
01:44:32,343 --> 01:44:33,640
He came home...

1019
01:44:34,145 --> 01:44:35,510
...and his eyes...

1020
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:38,410
...his eyes were so dead.

1021
01:44:39,216 --> 01:44:41,013
I asked him what was wrong.

1022
01:44:41,452 --> 01:44:45,445
What could be so bad
to make his eyes look that way?

1023
01:44:46,957 --> 01:44:49,255
And the only word that he could say...

1024
01:44:49,927 --> 01:44:51,292
...was your name.

1025
01:44:52,696 --> 01:44:56,029
Ten minutes later, I heard the shot.

1026
01:44:56,634 --> 01:45:00,968
Yes, George Gendron told me
old Norman went out with a bang.

1027
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:03,096
How many men have you destroyed?

1028
01:45:03,274 --> 01:45:05,435
How many men have you killed,
you monster?

1029
01:45:05,509 --> 01:45:07,101
Only the stupid ones.

1030
01:45:07,478 --> 01:45:11,471
Only the ones who handed me a knife
and then stretched out their throats.

1031
01:45:11,749 --> 01:45:15,480
Only the ones who, if you'll pardon
the expression, fucked up.

1032
01:45:18,622 --> 01:45:21,182
lf you'll excuse me,
l've got this bug problem...

1033
01:45:21,258 --> 01:45:24,921
...so we'll have to defer your charming
conversation for another time.

1034
01:45:24,995 --> 01:45:26,292
I hope you die!

1035
01:45:26,363 --> 01:45:27,387
By the way....

1036
01:45:27,464 --> 01:45:30,058
I hope you get cancer in the worst place.

1037
01:45:30,467 --> 01:45:32,196
Syphilis! Leprosy!

1038
01:45:33,037 --> 01:45:35,232
Scream in hell forever, you monster!

1039
01:45:35,773 --> 01:45:38,571
Would you mind telling me
who gave you my private number?

1040
01:45:38,642 --> 01:45:39,700
l'd like to fire him.

1041
01:45:39,777 --> 01:45:42,905
It was in my husband's address book,
you son of a bitch!

1042
01:45:43,948 --> 01:45:45,939
Well, l can't fire him, can l?

1043
01:46:00,497 --> 01:46:02,397
That better be you, Reynolds.

1044
01:46:07,571 --> 01:46:08,560
Talk to me.

1045
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,472
It's Carl Reynolds, sir.
I'm calling from Orlando, Florida.

1046
01:46:11,542 --> 01:46:13,373
Orlando? Florida?

1047
01:46:13,978 --> 01:46:17,505
The wife and I decided to take the kids
to Disney World this year--

1048
01:46:17,581 --> 01:46:20,641
l don't care if you decided
to take the kids to Attica this year.

1049
01:46:20,718 --> 01:46:22,811
There are still roaches in this place.

1050
01:46:22,887 --> 01:46:25,014
l killed one not five minutes ago.

1051
01:46:26,357 --> 01:46:28,154
Do you like your job, Reynolds?

1052
01:46:28,225 --> 01:46:30,591
I've spoken to Mr. White,
who's on desk tonight.

1053
01:46:30,661 --> 01:46:32,652
Do you like your job, Reynolds?

1054
01:46:33,163 --> 01:46:34,152
Yes, sir.

1055
01:46:34,231 --> 01:46:36,665
l'm glad to hear it,
because l want to see White.

1056
01:46:36,734 --> 01:46:38,895
Mr. Pratt, it's almost quarter of ten--

1057
01:46:38,969 --> 01:46:40,698
lf l don't first see White...

1058
01:46:40,771 --> 01:46:43,433
...and then the exterminators
within a half an hour...

1059
01:46:43,507 --> 01:46:46,704
...you will have no job by midnight tonight.
Do you understand me?

1060
01:46:46,777 --> 01:46:50,543
Next year you can take the wife and kids
to Disney World on your welfare check.

1061
01:46:50,614 --> 01:46:53,208
Have you got that?
Are we together on this?

1062
01:46:55,319 --> 01:46:56,149
Yes, sir.

1063
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:58,552
Good. l trust we are. Goodbye.

1064
01:47:07,398 --> 01:47:09,025
You have to watch them.

1065
01:47:11,635 --> 01:47:13,364
Castonmeyer, Reynolds...

1066
01:47:14,972 --> 01:47:15,939
...bugs.

1067
01:47:17,508 --> 01:47:18,998
That's all they are.

1068
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:20,670
All of them.

1069
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,713
And although
they're essentially brainless...

1070
01:47:32,156 --> 01:47:33,987
...you have to watch them...

1071
01:47:34,858 --> 01:47:37,326
...'cause they creep up on you.

1072
01:47:41,065 --> 01:47:42,589
They creep up on you.

1073
01:48:25,909 --> 01:48:27,638
Talk to me. Who's there?

1074
01:48:28,012 --> 01:48:30,344
Good evening there, Mr. Pratt.

1075
01:48:31,148 --> 01:48:33,639
Got bugs again, huh, Mr. Pratt?

1076
01:48:33,884 --> 01:48:36,148
Don't you talk to me like that, you hear?

1077
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:37,710
What way, Mr. Pratt?

1078
01:48:38,022 --> 01:48:39,387
Like I was crazy.

1079
01:48:40,190 --> 01:48:42,420
No, sir, Mr. Pratt, sir.

1080
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,251
I don't think you're crazy. Not at all.

1081
01:48:45,929 --> 01:48:48,124
I wasjust trying to think...

1082
01:48:48,298 --> 01:48:51,131
...who might have a 24-hour
fumigating service.

1083
01:48:51,502 --> 01:48:54,528
l might be able to get Pirelli Brothers
out here by...

1084
01:48:54,805 --> 01:48:56,500
...shall we say 11:30.

1085
01:48:57,374 --> 01:48:59,035
You might go far, White.

1086
01:48:59,109 --> 01:49:01,373
I've noticed that, in servicejobs...

1087
01:49:01,812 --> 01:49:04,110
...people like yourself often do.

1088
01:49:04,848 --> 01:49:06,213
People of color.

1089
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:08,574
Yes, 11:30 will be fine.

1090
01:49:09,386 --> 01:49:11,946
Thanks, Mr. Pratt, sir.

1091
01:49:12,489 --> 01:49:16,255
l'll call them just as soon as l finish
with that shower on 23.

1092
01:49:17,261 --> 01:49:19,593
Do it first! Do it now.

1093
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:21,764
Yes, sir. Right now.

1094
01:49:27,838 --> 01:49:29,066
Only stunned.

1095
01:49:29,907 --> 01:49:31,534
That's the explanation.

1096
01:49:32,476 --> 01:49:34,501
Roaches are very hard to kill...

1097
01:49:35,245 --> 01:49:36,769
...and they're quick.

1098
01:49:37,314 --> 01:49:39,111
They can creep up on you.

1099
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:42,418
They can creep up on you if you let them.

1100
01:50:01,071 --> 01:50:04,438
You see, Mrs. Castonmeyer,
l grew up in hell's kitchen!

1101
01:50:05,609 --> 01:50:06,940
Bugs everywhere.

1102
01:50:07,444 --> 01:50:10,413
And l know what to do with a bug
when l see it.

1103
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:12,405
Spray it!

1104
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:15,142
Squash it! Kill it!

1105
01:50:20,557 --> 01:50:21,888
What the fuck?

1106
01:50:23,227 --> 01:50:25,388
Another son-of-a-bitching blackout.

1107
01:50:27,564 --> 01:50:30,499
lf it was my power company,
this would never happen.

1108
01:50:37,508 --> 01:50:38,839
Goddamned bugs!

1109
01:50:42,012 --> 01:50:43,036
Bastards!

1110
01:50:47,451 --> 01:50:50,113
Fucking roaches! Goddamned bugs!

1111
01:50:52,956 --> 01:50:55,891
l'll kill you, you goddamned little buggers!

1112
01:51:21,985 --> 01:51:24,010
Come on! What do l pay you for?

1113
01:51:29,493 --> 01:51:30,653
Police emergency.

1114
01:51:30,727 --> 01:51:33,355
lt's about time!
What are you people doing down there?

1115
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:35,022
We've got problems tonight, fella.

1116
01:51:35,098 --> 01:51:38,795
-Or haven't you looked out your window?
-Listen. This is the Upson Pratt.

1117
01:51:38,869 --> 01:51:39,858
l've got bugs!

1118
01:51:39,937 --> 01:51:43,202
Everyone's got bugs tonight,
and I don't have time for bullshit.

1119
01:51:43,273 --> 01:51:46,003
No, you don't understand.
These are cockroaches.

1120
01:51:46,476 --> 01:51:49,570
The biggest ones l've ever seen.
This has to stop!

1121
01:51:50,514 --> 01:51:54,177
On a slow night we could maybe
talk about it, but this isn't a slow night--

1122
01:51:54,251 --> 01:51:56,845
l don't think you understand
who you're talking to.

1123
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,650
This is Upson Pratt! Upson Pratt!

1124
01:52:00,857 --> 01:52:03,553
l'll see to it you lose your job, you asshole!

1125
01:52:09,132 --> 01:52:10,531
White, talk to me!

1126
01:52:11,068 --> 01:52:14,299
White, l know you can hear me.
The PA's on the emergency circuit!

1127
01:52:14,371 --> 01:52:15,702
Talk to me!

1128
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:18,767
Mr. Pratt, I'm stuck in the damn elevator.

1129
01:52:18,976 --> 01:52:20,671
You can't be stuck in the elevator.

1130
01:52:20,744 --> 01:52:22,803
l want you here now! There are roaches!

1131
01:52:22,879 --> 01:52:24,005
Hundreds of them!

1132
01:52:24,081 --> 01:52:26,709
I'm going to be here
until the power comes on. Sorry.

1133
01:52:26,783 --> 01:52:29,081
l'll have your job, you black bastard!

1134
01:52:51,041 --> 01:52:52,406
Come on, come on!

1135
01:52:58,749 --> 01:53:00,842
You'll never get in here. Never!

1136
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,652
When this blackout is over, people will pay.

1137
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,654
Oh, yes. And you'll pay too.

1138
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:09,083
Every damn one of you!

1139
01:53:09,893 --> 01:53:11,861
l've been beating bugs all my life.

1140
01:53:11,928 --> 01:53:14,021
And l'll beat you too, bastards!

1141
01:53:16,633 --> 01:53:17,759
Talk to me.

1142
01:53:21,438 --> 01:53:22,405
Pratt!

1143
01:53:22,739 --> 01:53:25,572
You old monster. I hope you die.

1144
01:53:26,376 --> 01:53:27,673
I hope you die!

1145
01:53:28,111 --> 01:53:30,341
I hope you die!

1146
01:53:43,827 --> 01:53:46,159
I hope you die!

1147
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:11,612
Mr. Pratt?

1148
01:54:12,422 --> 01:54:14,083
You there, Mr. Pratt?

1149
01:54:14,991 --> 01:54:16,083
Mr. Pratt?

1150
01:54:16,326 --> 01:54:17,657
Talk to me!

1151
01:54:18,795 --> 01:54:21,730
Talk to me. Talk to me, honky bastard.

1152
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:25,528
What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?

1153
01:54:26,036 --> 01:54:28,027
Bugs got your tongue?

1154
01:54:53,864 --> 01:54:54,956
Mr. Pratt?

1155
01:54:56,199 --> 01:54:57,291
Mr. Pratt?

1156
01:54:58,602 --> 01:54:59,591
Bastard!

1157
01:55:48,585 --> 01:55:50,917
Chew your food before you swallow!

1158
01:55:53,757 --> 01:55:55,782
-What's that?
-lt's a comic book.

1159
01:55:55,959 --> 01:55:56,857
What?

1160
01:55:57,093 --> 01:55:58,424
lt's a comic book.

1161
01:55:58,495 --> 01:55:59,621
lt's a comic book!

1162
01:55:59,696 --> 01:56:00,822
Comic book!

1163
01:56:01,231 --> 01:56:03,722
-My kids love these things.
-l love them too.

1164
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,165
Hey, look, look!

1165
01:56:05,268 --> 01:56:09,170
You can send away for all this stuff here.
Look, x-ray glasses.

1166
01:56:09,306 --> 01:56:13,299
They don't work. They make your
eyes black. You look in and it's a gag.

1167
01:56:14,277 --> 01:56:17,075
Look, an authentic voodoo doll.

1168
01:56:17,747 --> 01:56:20,875
-Somebody already sent for it.
-Yeah, we can't get that.

1169
01:56:20,984 --> 01:56:24,351
How about this?
"Tired of gettin' sand kicked in your face?"

1170
01:56:28,124 --> 01:56:29,386
Where's Billy?

1171
01:56:29,493 --> 01:56:32,018
He'll be down in a minute. l know he's up.

1172
01:56:32,195 --> 01:56:33,162
Billy?

1173
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:35,725
Stan, are you all right?

1174
01:56:37,534 --> 01:56:39,695
l didn't get much sleep last night.

1175
01:56:40,270 --> 01:56:41,362
The storm?

1176
01:56:41,972 --> 01:56:43,633
No. lt's this damn stiff neck.

1177
01:56:43,707 --> 01:56:45,436
l can barely move my head.

1178
01:56:45,775 --> 01:56:47,504
You must have strained it.

1179
01:56:47,611 --> 01:56:50,045
Yeah, l guess. l don't know.

1180
01:56:51,948 --> 01:56:53,006
You poor bear.

1181
01:56:53,083 --> 01:56:55,244
Do you want me to get some Ben Gay?

1182
01:57:00,991 --> 01:57:03,482
l'll teach him to throw away
my comic books.

1183
01:57:08,798 --> 01:57:11,096
Ready for another shot, Dad?
