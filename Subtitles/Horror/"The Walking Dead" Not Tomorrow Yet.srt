No, there's plenty.
I foraged a lot of acorns.

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,930
Worried about tomorrow.

177
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,990
You going?

178
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,400
No.

179
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,660
You are.

180
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,650
You can
do things that--

181
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,320
that just terrify me.

182
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,290
How?

183
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,380
How do you think
I do those things?

184
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,970
You're a mom.

185
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,640
I was.

186
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,110
You<i> are.</i>

187
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,060
It-- it--

188
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,950
it's not the cookies
or the smiles.

189
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,780
It's--

190
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,280
it's the hard stuff.

191
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,570
The scary stuff.

192
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,990
It's how you can do it.

193
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,580
It's strength.

194
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,670
You're a mom to most
of the people here.

195
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,060
To you, too?

196
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,980
No.

197
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,850
You're something else to me.

198
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,870
Well, it's not tomorrow yet.

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,960
Packing your stilettos?

200
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,300
We'll only be gone a night.

201
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm going.

202
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,550
I am, too, but tomorrow.

203
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm leaving.

204
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,230
Why?

205
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,980
<i>It happens.</i>

206
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,070
Are you serious?

207
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,770
This is how I want it.

208
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,410
- Why?
- Why are dingleberries brown?

209
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,580
It's just the way shit is.

210
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
No, no. After everything
we've been through,

211
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,420
you are not walking out that
door unless you can tell me why.

212
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,140
Tell me!

213
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,220
Tell me why!

214
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,140
When I first met you,

215
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,980
I thought you were
the last woman on Earth.

216
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,260
You're not.

217
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,270
( sobbing )

218
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
You try one of these?
They're chewy.

219
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,460
They, uh...

220
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,930
got some fight in them.

221
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,440
Rick:
<i>Describe it.</i>

222
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,360
Andy: Rectangular building,
big satellites on it.

223
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,140
- Rick:<i> Any windows?</i>
- I don't remember any.

224
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
I think they made it
so there's only one way in.

225
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,480
Rick:
<i>Guards outside?</i>

226
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah, two of them, at least.

227
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,030
Michonne: <i>And you don't know
how many people they have?</i>

228
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,490
No.

229
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,240
Uh, I mean, no. I saw a place
where they stored food.

230
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
It wasn't that big, so...

231
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,960
- Rick:<i> You've been inside?</i>
- Yeah.

232
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,830
They had us load in
supplies one time.

233
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,330
Glenn: Hmm.
What do you remember?

234
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you worried?

235
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,670
No.

236
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,890
No, it's just...

237
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,180
I love you, and I just
wanted to say it before--

238
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,680
you don't have to say it back.

239
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,150
It's--

240
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll say it when you come back.

241
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,360
Heath and I are still
going on that two-weeker.

242
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,860
We're gonna leave from there.

243
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,530
Do you want to come?

244
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,080
I mean, I can change it so we
don't leave from the compound.

245
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,620
We could come back and we
could leave from here.

246
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,200
- You know, we're gonna get meds, so...
- I can't.

247
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,210
- No, I didn't-- I'm-- I just-- I need to be here.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm the only doctor now.

249
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,790
So I can't.

250
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,460
Yeah.

251
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
But I want to.

252
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
( soft laugh )

253
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,060
I'll tell you
when you come back.

254
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,730
( both laugh )

255
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,140
Yeah.

256
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,320
Maggie: <i>And you didn't
see any other rooms?</i>

257
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,410
Andy:
No, it's a big place.

258
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,410
This is the hallway I saw.

259
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,080
There is more.

260
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,880
And every time, they had you
bring things into here?

261
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,330
Jesus.

262
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,890
We brought a couple
spears for them.

263
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,390
Two of the Saviors took
them down this hallway.

264
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,340
Now, they must've
done something with them

265
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,180
because they didn't
come back with them.

266
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,090
Jesus: <i>Maybe a weapons
locker, an armory.</i>

267
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,260
Okay.

268
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,230
We get in there,
secure the armory,

269
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,100
that's how we end it.

270
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
That's how Carol ended it here.

271
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,410
But we don't know if they have
an armory or where it even is.

272
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,500
Well, we've got
a lot of good guesses.

273
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,200
We've done more with less.

274
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,500
We go in at night
while they're sleeping.

275
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,290
The guards won't be sleeping.

276
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,120
Like I said, I think
there's only one way in

277
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,340
and there's no way
to bust through that door

278
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,840
<i>without waking up
the rest of them.</i>

279
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,010
We don't need to.

280
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,100
They're going to open it for
us, let us walk right in.

281
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,680
They want Gregory's head, right?

282
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,060
We're gonna give it to them.

283
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,580
<i>( brakes squealing )</i>

284
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,710
( engine stops )

285
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,800
( horns honk )

286
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,390
Aaron, Rosita.

287
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,640
You start here.

288
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,080
We'll peel off
every quarter mile,

289
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,150
meet back here
in a couple of hours.

290
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,980
See what we got.

291
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,960
There's no turning back now.

292
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,490
I could walk.

293
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,830
Maybe run a little, maybe a lot.

294
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm not going anywhere.

295
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,250
I wanted to learn and you
taught me for a reason.

296
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,300
Why are you still wearing that?

297
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,680
It's still who I was.

298
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I think.

299
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,850
And it'll be harder for
them to see me in the dark.

300
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,680
( chuckles )

301
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,030
I almost told everyone
at the meeting.

302
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,540
We're not telling them.

303
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,570
Morgan stood up in that church and
tried to talk us out of this.

304
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,570
What's wrong with that?

305
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,380
Maybe that he didn't know what
the hell he's talking about?

306
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,280
That he should take the win

307
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,010
that we didn't kick his ass out
for hiding that psychopath.

308
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,800
If we told everyone, they'd find
out about Denise, you know that.

309
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,640
That<i> hijo de puta</i>
tried to stand there

310
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,290
and act like we didn't
know what we were--

311
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,860
He doesn't want to kill.

312
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,640
We don't want to kill.
We don't like it.

313
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,830
It happens.

314
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,470
I'm not telling anyone.

315
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,590
( snarling )

316
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,580
What do you think?

317
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,350
Maybe.

318
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,670
If we, um, cut the hair...

319
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>trim the beard.</i>

320
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,460
<i>If it's dark.</i>

321
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
We're gonna kill those people.

322
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,020
Tonight.

323
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,940
Look, I've been lucky.

324
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,240
I haven't had to do it before.

325
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,140
Have you?

326
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,150
I've been lucky, too.

327
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,410
You nervous?

328
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,710
Have you ever seen
something that, um...

329
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,990
afterwards, you--

330
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,960
you didn't want to sleep

331
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
and you weren't hungry because
when you close your eyes

332
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,830
you could see it?

333
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,470
- And when you try to eat--
- Yeah.

334
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,060
Me, too.

335
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,880
Killing somebody has gotta
be worse than that.

336
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,720
It has to be.

337
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,660
So, yeah...

338
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm nervous.

339
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,110
For the whole thing, man.

340
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,160
For the whole thing.

341
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,180
Rick: We're gonna
take a look around,

342
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,050
try to get a feel for how
many people are in there.

343
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,360
We like how it looks, we go in.

344
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,810
A couple of hours before dawn.

345
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,280
The guards outside'll be tired.

346
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,730
<i>Everyone inside'll be sleeping.</i>

347
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,200
We don't like what we see, we
head back, make a new plan.

348
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,910
They don't know who we are.

349
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,040
<i>We'll keep Jesus in the shadows.</i>

350
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,610
This is how we eat.

351
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,660
This is how we eat.

352
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,640
We roll out at midnight.

353
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,470
Why is Maggie here?

354
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,630
She's guarding the perimeter.

355
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,100
Yeah, but why is she here?

356
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,740
'Cause it's her choice.

357
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,190
I want to stay
out there with her.

358
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,530
Well, this whole thing's
a race to the armory.

359
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,950
We need as many people
inside as we can get.

360
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,280
She shouldn't
be out there alone.

361
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,620
She shouldn't be out here
in the first place.

362
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,020
Okay.

363
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,460
Good.

364
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,600
She's done with the hair?

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,970
What've we got?

366
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,300
- That one.
- Yeah, that's it.

367
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,560
Rick:
<i>All right.</i>

368
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,280
Though, it's probably good
we're doing this at night.

369
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Something wrong with it?

370
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,700
The nose. Gregory's
is a different shape.

371
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,330
He fought back.

372
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,500
He broke your hand, right?

373
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,670
Guess there's no reason
to be subtle about it.

374
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,890
What?

375
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,730
The Saviors, they're scary,

376
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,750
but those pricks
got nothing on you.

377
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,680
Man:
<i>Stop right there!</i>

378
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,880
<i>Announce yourself, asshole!</i>

379
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,970
It's Eddie from Hilltop!

380
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,470
It's done!

381
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,550
Man:
<i>Step out!</i>

382
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,890
( engine stops )

383
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,320
Man:
<i>Is that it?</i>

384
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,990
Yeah!

385
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,120
Man: <i>Bring it here, shit brain!</i>

386
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,570
( door opens )

387
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,010
I don't want the bag,
needle dick.

388
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,610
Will you look at this shit?

389
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,130
He broke my hand.
I broke his nose.

390
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,130
That's why he looks that way.

391
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,070
( nasal voice )
Little bitch broke my nose.

392
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,740
-<i> ( man laughing )</i>
- Wah.

393
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,240
<i>( head thuds )</i>

394
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,170
( normal voice )
Okay, looks like you learned.

395
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,380
I'll get your guy,
you'll go home,

396
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,000
and you bring us more
stuff next week, hmm?

397
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,150
( whistling "Happy Birthday" )

398
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,520
( gurgles )

399
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,850
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

400
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,140
- ( knife slices )
- Ahh!

401
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,390
- ( gasps )
- It's okay, it's okay.

402
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,310
<i>We're bringing you back.
We're bringing you back.</i>

403
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,920
Check the doors.
Find the arsenal.

404
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,470
We take them out.

405
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,410
( door creaks )

406
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,560

411
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,930
You still a priest?

412
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,300
Rick and Carl
taught me about guns,

413
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,970
other weapons.

414
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,720
How to contribute.

415
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm still a priest.

416
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,040
I lied to my girlfriend
this morning.

417
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,990
I, um-- she caught me
thinking about something,

418
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,050
so I told her that I loved her.

419
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,670
For the first time.

420
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,590
That's how I told her,
covering something up.

421
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,340
What were you covering?

422
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,560
That I'd done something
like this before.

423
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,680
That I didn't like it.

424
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,740
Do you?

425
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,940
Do you love her?

426
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,780
Yeah.

427
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,420
So, you know what
you're fighting for.

428
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,940
Hmm.

429
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,140
Honeypot.

<i>( alarm blaring )</i>

434
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,550
They're in trouble.
Stay here.

435
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,090
- I'm going with you.
- I said stay here.

436
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,300
No.

437
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,010
Damn it, Maggie.

438
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,980
- I have to.
- No, you don't. You don't have to.

439
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,260
Yes, I do.

440
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,090
<i>What the hell
are you doing here?</i>

441
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,680
What am I supposed to do?

442
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,430
You're supposed
to be someone else.

443
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,070
<i>( alarm continues )</i>

444
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,320
They need our help.

We need to go. Get them
back to the Hilltop.

450
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,890
What? Your people
could be in trouble.

451
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,690
If you get them back,
the deal's still on, right?

452
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,360
Right?

453
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,690
If they get themselves back.

454
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,530
Andy, drive him
back to the Hilltop.

455
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,560
<i>- ( car door closes )
- ( engine starts )</i>

456
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,070
Look, if they see you
and we don't make it--

457
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,370
We're gonna make it. And
they're not gonna see me.

458
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,740
Are you kidding?

459
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,380
Go!

460
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,470

Ah!

464

it was gonna be you.
