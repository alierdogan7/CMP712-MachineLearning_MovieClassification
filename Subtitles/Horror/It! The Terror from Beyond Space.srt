TO THE GROUND.                  

118
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,336
THEN I'M GONNA ROLL AROUND AND  
STRETCH LIKE A CAT IN THE SUN.  

119
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,305
            OH, BOY,            
            THE SUN.            

120
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,541
     WE'LL BE 50 MILLION        
     MILES CLOSER TO IT.        

121
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:23,343
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID, I COULD  
 NEVER STAND BEING COLD.        

122
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:25,312
HOW'D YOU EVER WIN THE          
ARDMORE FELLOWSHIP              

123
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,746
IN LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS?     

124
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,449
I WORE LONG UNDERWEAR.          
                    HA HA HA.   

125
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,650
             AAH.               
THAT FIGURES.                   

126
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:31,952
WHAT DO YOU                     
LOOK FORWARD TO?                

127
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:32,786
                     GIRLS!     

128
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,854
                 OH, YOU!       

129
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:38,192
             I THINK I REMEMBER,
         A FASCINATING RESEARCH.

130
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,759
                 WON'T A        
                GEOLOGIST DO?   

131
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:42,196
 YOU'RE, UH, MILITARY           
     PROPERTY, ANN.             

132
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:43,630
             OCCUPIED TERRITORY.

133
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:46,032
EVERY TIME VAN                  
SEES YOU, HE FLOATS,            

134
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,234
 EVEN THOUGH THE                
SHIP IS EQUIPPED                

135
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:48,502
WITH ARTIFICIAL                 
GRAVITY.                        

136
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,270
         [Chuckling]            

137
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:52,072
     THESE DAYS, VAN SEEMS MORE 
     CONCERNED OVER A MANHUNT,  

138
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,507
     THAN A WOMAN HUNT.         

139
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:56,443
IT'S JUST THAT ERIC BELIEVES    
CARRUTHERS' STORY, I DON'T.     

140
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:59,496
     I DON'T BELIEVE IT,        
             NECESSARILY.       

141
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:00,730
            NOR DO I            
         DISBELIEVE IT.         

142
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,866
HOWEVER, ONE THING'S SURE:      
 HE DOES BELIEVE IT.            

143
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,169
 HE HAD TO FORCE HIMSELF TO     
 BELIEVE IT OR HE'D GO INSANE.  

144
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:09,906
         AND I DIDN'T           
         DO THAT, DID I?        

145
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,975
         MISSED YOUR DINNER,    
             COL. CARRUTHERS.   

146
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,044
         I'M TIRED OF           
     RUINING APPETITES.         

147
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,313
     I'D JUST LIKE A COFFEE,    
    IF I MAY, MISS ANDERSON.    

148
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,881
         OF COURSE,             
         COLONEL.               

149
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:21,284
         BETTER STAY HERE,      
             CARRUTHERS.        

150
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:21,985
                 JIMMY?         

151
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,053
    YEAH.                       

152
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,454
    HERE'S SOME LAST-MINUTE     
         COMPUTATIONS           

153
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,256
             ON ADJUSTING       
             THE ORBIT.         

154
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,657
         LOOK 'EM OVER WHEN     
            YOU GET A CHANCE.   

155
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,426
     YES, SIR.                  

156
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,535
BY THE TIME WE                  
REACH EARTH,                    

157
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,370
I'LL HAVE HIS                   
CONFESSION ON TAPE.             

158
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,764
        COL. CARRUTHERS!        

159
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:19,475
 THANK YOU.                     

160
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:25,681
SUCH A COLD, DESOLATE WORLD.    
    WE SAW SO LITTLE OF IT.     

161
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:28,351
         SOMETIMES I ALMOST     
         WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.   

162
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,023
I KILLED THEM OR I DIDN'T.      
IT WAS ME OR SOMETHING.         

163
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,292
         I'VE ONLY HEARD THE    
         STORY THROUGH VAN.     

164
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,094
NOW YOU'D LIKE TO               
HEAR MY VERSION?                

165
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:40,863
 ALL RIGHT.                     

166
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:45,969
     IT'S A LONG STORY,         
     BUT I'LL MAKE IT BRIEF.    

167
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,204
                     WE WERE ALL
             OUTSIDE THE SHIP,  

168
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:52,375
EXPLORING THE SOUTHERN TIP      
     OF SYRTIS MAJOR,           

169
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,178
SUDDENLY A SANDSTORM CAME UP    
 AND WE STARTED BACK.           

170
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,480
                 I WAS DRIVING  
                 THE JEEP.      

171
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:00,951
     THE SAND WAS SO THICK      
     WE COULD BARELY SEE.       

172
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,853
     WE WERE ALMOST BACK        
     TO THE SHIP WHEN...        

173
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:08,058
         CARTWRIGHT             
        JUST DISAPPEARED.       

174
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,861
 ONE MINUTE HE WAS THERE AND    
 THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS GONE.   

175
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:14,297
    AS IF SOMETHING HAD JUST    
 PLUCKED HIM OUT OF THE JEEP    

176
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:18,201
 LIKE...CANDY OUT OF A BOX.     

177
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:24,174
     WE HEARD A WEIRD           
        SORT OF SOUND.          

178
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,676
         THEN WE THOUGHT        
     WE SAW A DARK SHAPE        

179
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:31,214
     RUNNING NEAR THE JEEP      
 AND STARTED SHOOTING AT IT.    

180
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,748
     A FEW MOMENTS LATER,       

181
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:36,819
         KENNER AND ALL         
     THE REST WERE GONE.        

182
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:41,358
     I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO     
    MADE IT BACK TO THE SHIP.   

183
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,160
                 WHEN THE       
            SANDSTORM QUIT, I...

184
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,329
                 WENT OUT AND   
             SEARCHED ALL OVER. 

185
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:47,030
                 THERE WASN'T   
                 A SIGN OF THEM.

186
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:50,700
HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN             
THE BULLET HOLE                 
IN THE SKULL?                   

187
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,503
        WE WERE ALL SHOOTING    
            AT THIS THING...    

188
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:57,941
         MAYBE THE ONE WHO GOT  
         THE BULLET WAS LUCKY.  

189
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,878
            YOU DON'T BELIEVE   
             ME, DO YOU?        

190
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,913
I DON'T DISBELIEVE YOU.         

191
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,785
            HOW ABOUT YOU,      
             LIEUTENANT?        

192
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:12,588
                 MARS IS ALMOST 
                AS BIG AS TEXAS,

193
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:18,861
                     MAYBE IT'S 
                 GOT MONSTERS.  

194
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,597
CARRUTHERS IS STILL TALKING     
ABOUT HIS MONSTERS?             

195
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,799
         WHY DON'T YOU STOP     
         BAITING HIM, VAN?      

196
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,202
         YOU'RE NOT USING YOUR  
         AUTHORITY VERY WELL.   

197
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,105
I'M NOT DOING IT FOR KICKS.     
BELIEVE ME, CHICKEN.            

198
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,640
I'M JUST PLAYING                
THE ODDS.                       

199
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,410
            YOUR ODDS, BECAUSE  
         YOU THINK HE'S GUILTY. 

200
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:39,315
    ADMITTED.                   

201
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,717
BUT, ANNE, THERE'S A TIME       
FACTOR INVOLVED HERE.           

202
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:43,619
HE'S UNSTABLE                   
RIGHT NOW.                      

203
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,321
IF I CRACK HIS STORY,           
I CAN TURN HIM OVER             

204
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,091
TO THE COURT-MARTIAL TIED       
UP IN A LITTLE PINK RIBBON.     

205
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,226
            WHAT IF HE'S DONE   
         NOTHING TO CONFESS?    

206
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:51,861
THEN HE WON'T.                  

207
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,531
BUT I OWE IT TO THE LIVES       
OF THOSE 9 MEN WHO DIED         

208
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:55,831
TO TRY AND                      
FIND OUT.                       

209
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,267
            DON'T YOU OWE IT    
             TO CARRUTHERS      

210
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,169
             TO TREAT HIM AS    
            A FELLOW OFFICER,   

211
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,970
             NOT AS AN ANIMAL?  

212
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,073
DO YOU THINK                    
HE'S INNOCENT?                  

213
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,007
            I DON'T KNOW.       

214
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,410
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO DECIDE,      
     OR FOR YOU, VAN.           

215
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,653
    OK, CHICKEN. I'LL LET UP    
        ON THE THIRD DEGREE.    

216
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,188
         LOOKS LIKE I EITHER    
            HAVE TO DO THAT     

217
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,622
         OR GET LYNCHED MYSELF. 

218
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,425
IT'S YOU I'M WORRIED            
ABOUT, VAN.                     

219
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,660
I HATE TO SEE YOU               
SO VINDICTIVE.                  

220
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,117
EVERY MOVE I                    
MAKE'S WORSE.                   

221
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,785
     AH, COME ON,               
     ERIC, RESIGN--             

222
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:49,953
 NO!                            

223
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:50,988
         AAH!                   

224
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,523
I HAVEN'T RESIGNED              
A GAME IN 30 YEARS.             

225
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,859
I'LL BE DAMNED IF               
I'M GONNA DO IT NOW.            

226
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,634
         [Crashing]

01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:36,058
     I GOT IT FIGURED HOW       
     THE CRITTER GOT ABOARD.    

686
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,259
             <i> HOW?</i>              

687
01:03:37,326 --> 01:03:39,161
     IT MUST'VE FOLLOWED        
     US BACK TO THE SHIP,       

688
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:41,263
     AFTER WE PICKED YOU UP,    

689
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,265
     CLIMBED ONE OF THE FINS    

690
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:45,534
     <i> JUST BEFORE TAKEOFF</i>       
     <i> AND GOT IN THROUGH</i>        

691
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:49,805
<i> THE OPEN EMERGENCY HATCH</i>       
    <i> IN C COMPARTMENT.</i>          

692
01:03:49,873 --> 01:03:52,607
             SOUNDS RIGHT.      

693
01:03:52,676 --> 01:03:54,843
            HOW'S THE AIR       
             DOWN THERE?        

694
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,078
         PRETTY BAD.            

695
01:03:56,146 --> 01:03:59,815
     MY SUIT-TANK HELPS,        
     BUT IT'S ABOUT EMPTY.      

696
01:03:59,883 --> 01:04:00,916
         [Growling]             

697
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:02,284
             ED?                

698
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:03,418
         IT'S MOVIN'.           

699
01:04:11,327 --> 01:04:13,729
    <i> IT'S GOING UP THE LADDER.</i>  

700
01:04:13,797 --> 01:04:15,731
 I CAN HEAR IT PROWLIN'         
     AROUND UP THERE.           

701
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,707
ANNE, MARY, GET THOSE           
FLASHLIGHTS ON QUICK.           

702
01:04:31,965 --> 01:04:34,432
        ED, IT'S GOING UP       
        TO FIRST STORAGE,       

703
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,201
 <i> BANGING ON EVERYTHING</i>         
     <i> IT PASSES.</i>                

704
01:04:36,268 --> 01:04:38,303
        <i> IT'S GOIN' NUTS.</i>       

705
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,805
            CAN YOU GET TO      
             THE AIR LOCK?      

706
01:04:39,872 --> 01:04:44,743
 WHY? LOOK AT THE PRETTY STARS  
 THROUGH MY BROKEN FACEPLATE.   

707
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:47,012
         GET IN THE AIR LOCK    
             AND HIDE THERE.    

708
01:04:57,107 --> 01:04:58,640
     ERIC.                      

709
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,043
 TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.           

710
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:03,979
THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION'S        
    WAY UP.                     

711
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:06,314
40 PERCENT OVER EVERY           
PREVIOUS MAXIMUM.               

712
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:09,818
        40 PERCENT! PERHAPS THE 
         GAS FROM THE GRENADES. 

713
01:05:09,886 --> 01:05:12,888
 NO, THAT WOULDN'T              
AFFECT IT THAT MUCH.            

714
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:17,425
    IT'S NOT A LEAK,            
THE PRESSURE'S ALL RIGHT.       

715
01:05:17,493 --> 01:05:19,862
 ARE YOU THINKING THE           
SAME THING I'M THINKING?        

716
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:21,529
                 THE CREATURE?  

717
01:05:21,597 --> 01:05:25,700
IT MUST HAVE ENORMOUS LUNGS     
FROM THE THIN AIR ON MARS.      

718
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:27,803
     LET ALL THE AIR            
    OUT OF THE SHIP.            

719
01:05:27,871 --> 01:05:30,105
IF WE CAN DO IT IN TIME,        
WE CAN KILL IT.                 

720
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:31,874
                 WE CAN BUILD UP
         OUR AIR SUPPLY LATER.  

721
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:32,707
         RIGHT!                 

722

725
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:39,641
    [Calder] DRIVE HIM BELOW    
 SO I CAN GET TO THE AIR LOCK.
