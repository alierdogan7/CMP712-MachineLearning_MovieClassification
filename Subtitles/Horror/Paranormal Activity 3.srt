00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,589
I'm gonna take the color out.

340
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,467
It looks like dust is falling on something.

341
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,260
It looks like a figure, right?

342
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,553
- You see that?
- Yeah.

343
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,305
Did you catch that?

344
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,681
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?

345
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,183
- It moved, right?
- What was that?

346
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,851
I don't know. Check it out.

347
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,395
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.

348
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,106
You know, I've been hearing
these noises in the girls' room lately.

349
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,525
I don't know. I feel like it's...

350
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,984
Something weird's going on.

351
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,320
- DENNIS: Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.

352
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,699
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you...

353
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,826
(SHRIEKS) Dennis!

354
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

355
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Oh, my God!

356
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,246
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

357
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,289
You mind if I set up
a couple cameras around the house?

358
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,208
I'm not going to talk to you right now.

359
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,293
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?

360
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,130
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.

361
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,716
KATIE: How long do the tapes last?

362
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,051
DENNIS: About six hours each.

363
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,178
So you have to change
them every six hours?

364
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,513
Mmm, yes.

365
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,724
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?

366
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,935
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...

367
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,645
Keep going.

368
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,022
- KATIE: Can I see it?
- Sure.

369
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,233
Here. Come here. See it?

370
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,401
Yeah.

371
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,403
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,321
So, what are you trying to see?

373
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,240
Uh, anything unusual or strange.

374
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,242
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.

375
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,910
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

376
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,579
Don't touch the camera or anything.

377
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,164
Katie, just leave it alone.

378
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,166
(CLATTERING)

379
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,255
- Dennis.
- What?

380
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,506
Really?

381
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,759
Don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

382
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,052
This is a new house.

383
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,221
It shouldn't be making these noises.

384
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,349
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.

385
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,895
No...

386
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,482
This is not gonna work here.

387
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,942
Like, what do you think
you're gonna catch?

388
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,028
Whatever's in our house.

389
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,657
Oh, right, 'cause there's
something here watching us.

390
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,204
Well, there's definitely something.

391
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,458
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.

392
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,126
JULIE: Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.

393
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,294
I feel a camera.

394
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,006
The earthquake, and all those...

395
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,258
I don't know,
stuff that's been happening and...

396
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,219
I don't know, I just...

397
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,596
No, it's totally normal.

398
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,932
(SIGHS)

399
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,435
Bye, camera.

400
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,481
Good night, camera.

401
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,815
(KISSES)

402
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,714

(PATTERING)

404
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,420
Yeah?

405
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,465
Yeah, probably.

406
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,552
In their bedroom.

407
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,305
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.

408
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,641
(WHISPERING) It's okay.

409
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,937
Why?

410
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:34,984
Oh.

411
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,986
Yeah, kind of.

412
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,821
He's very sweet.

413
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,796
Yeah, I saw that.

414
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,007
I watched some of the tapes
on the camera

415
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,385
and I saw you
talking to somebody late last night.

416
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,139
If you saw me talking to somebody,
it would be Toby.

417
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,975
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?

418
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,644
Yes. He's my friend.

419
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,854
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?

420
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,105
Mmm, secrets.

421
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,524
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.

422
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,526
So, is he old, like Grandma,

423
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,570
or is he young, like you?

424
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,199
He's old, like Grandma.

425
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,284
And what does he look like?

426
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,037
Is he tall? Is he fat?

427
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,914
He's tall. He's tall.

428
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,917
Don't call him fat.

429
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,128
Kristi, when you say that
if you tell one of your secrets

430
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,340
that you'll be in trouble with Toby,
what does that mean?

431
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,842
Well, I won't be safe.

432
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,971
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?

433
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,098
No.

434
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,142
But I won't be safe.

435
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,520
That means, I will be, like...

436
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,232
Be in very, very big trouble.

437
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,484
Big trouble.

438
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,735
DENNIS: You saw her.
JULIE: That's how it is.

439
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,237
It was like he was actually there, right?

440
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,363
I know.

441
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,865
Because that's how active
kids' imaginations are.

442
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,991
It's crazy.

443
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,326
I mean, imagination is one thing.

444
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,036
She got up in the middle of the night.

445
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,580
I mean, it's a little odd
that she got up in the middle...

446
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,166
You haven't been around kids
for that long. They do weird things.

447
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,919
They... Katie used to get up
in the middle of the night

448
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,629
and she used to sleep on the toilet.

449
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,922
(LAUGHING) What?

450
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,173
Okay? I'm serious.

451
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,299
Really?

452
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,011
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to
be gone in a couple weeks.

453
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,138
I know it.

454
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,848
RANDY: How many hours of footage
do you have?

455
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,976
This is the job, man. I got two cameras,

456
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,437
six hours each. Twelve hours.

457
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,939
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.

458
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,066
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.

459
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,193
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

460
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,196
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.

461
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,781
- RANDY: Hey, Julie.
- ...going?

462
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,032
DENNIS: Um... Good.

463
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,369
You want to step into my office
and do some work with me or...

464
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,455
No. You find anything?

465
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,666
RANDY: Yes, actually.
We did find something.

466
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,545
We found that
your family sleeps all night. Oh!

467
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,713
Very funny, Randy.

468
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,131
- Keep up the good work.
- DENNIS: Okay.

469
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,049
I love you with all of my heart and soul.

470
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,801
I love you, too.

471
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
It should either be called
Back to the Past...

472
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,430
RANDY: Present. Back to the Present.

473
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,723
- No, no.
- End of story.

474
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,641
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.

475
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,685
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.

476
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,562

- Good.

- That's a little bright.

I'm sorry.

- Mmm!
- KATIE: Give it to me.

517
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,644
Hey, guys. Don't tell Mom, okay?

518
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,062
- BOTH: Okay.
- All right.

519
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,439
What are you guys doing?

520
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,649
KATIE: You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.

521

into the house last night?

564

- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.

He doesn't have any money.

That is not true.

572
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,161

I mean, they just about think
he's the coolest guy ever.

574

I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.

575

It's just that the girls miss their father.

I don't know.

577

I wish he were
a little more financially secure.

578
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,179
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.

579
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,514
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No. That's... No.

I don't want to have any more kids.

Remember, I was telling you
the crazy stuff started happening

687
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,939
only when she started talking
to her imaginary friend.

That's what...

You know, that's what the book says.

690

They don't just stick around
for no reason. It wants something.

691

What does it want?

692
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,409
Well, the book says
it feeds off of your fear.

- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?

702
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,149
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.

703
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,650
Okay. I think it's on.

704
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:24,279
So, how you play is you say
"Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror

705
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,198
and then her dead body's
supposed to appear

706
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,617
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop! Stop!
