she experienced.

started appearing

I understand.

792
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,091
John, there is
a very rare syndrome,

793
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,525
which is often
brought on by stress,

794
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,649
which occurs when two people's
psyches become entwined.

795
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,924
It's a shared disorder,
called <i>"folie à deux."</i>

When two people with
close emotional ties

797
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,809
share the same hallucination.

The condition can be treated very
successfully through therapy,

812
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,280
but, John,
the first step will be

813
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,044
to separate you
from Mia for a while.

to my colleague, Dr Nowinski.

After many, many

He had no shape,

He wanted to be loved.
So he devised a plan.

943
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,881
First, he'd separate
the boy from his mother.

944
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,410
<i>Then he'd bring him
to his lair.</i>

945
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,446

face and wear it himself.</i>
