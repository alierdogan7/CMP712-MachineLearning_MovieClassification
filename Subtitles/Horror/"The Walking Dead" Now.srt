I'll get the RV.

7
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,912
I'll get in front of them
before they get there.

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,913
I can lead them away again.

9

23

the walkers from coming here.</i>

24

I'm sorry.

29

He said if he got stuck,

30
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,249

The panel the truck hit
seems intact.

52
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,922
We reinforced it just in case.

53
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:52,175
Either way, the wall's
gonna hold together.

54

They're gonna be back.

57

Daryl, Abraham, Sasha,
they have vehicles.

58
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:15,448
They're gonna lead 'em away,
just like the others.

59
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,868
And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna walk
back through the front gate after.

60
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,870
They know what they're doing,

61
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,207

62
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,760
We keep noise to a minimum.

63
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,429
Pull our blinds at night.

64
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,715
Even better,
keep the lights out.

All of them.

71

The plan that Rick
put into place

72
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,300
stopped that from happening.

73
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:09,636
<i>He got half of them away.</i>

74
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,260
I was out there
recruiting with Daryl.

75
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,099
I wanted to try to get into
a cannery and scavenge,

76
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:26,653
<i>and Daryl wanted</i>
<i>to keep looking for people.</i>

77

We did what I wanted...

78
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,611
and we wound up in a trap
set by those people.

79
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,996

80
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,866

<i>Those people who attacked us...</i>

82
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,957
they found their way
back here because of me.

83
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,807

We aren't going out there.

94
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:46,993
So what do we do?

95
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,248
We wait.

96
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,055
I can't even make
two meals out of this.

97
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:02,475
The soups and sauces can be stretched
out with some extra water.

98
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,145
What difference does that make
if we'll be dead tomorrow?

99
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,099
- We have to ration now--
- I can't.

100
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,654
I can't spend whatever time I have
left watching my family starve.

101
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,522
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

102
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,078
Sorry, Olivia. I just
don't see the point.

103

Spencer:
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

104
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:31,370
Stop.

105
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,539
Right now, stop it.

106
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,875
This stuff is for everyone.

107
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:38,211
We need to make it last
if we're gonna survive.

108
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:41,180
Why don't you go make sure
the gate's closed, Spencer?

109
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,966
Yeah.
That was me.

110
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,435
I did that.

111
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,973
But that truck
outside the walls,

112
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:54,143
it'd be inside
if it wasn't for me.

113
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,479
I did that, too.

114
00:09:56,481 --> 00:10:00,650
If I didn't, maybe we wouldn't
be talking right now.

115
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,487
Where were you, Bruce?

116
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,711
Doing this will start us down
a road where nothing matters.

117
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,298
Where no one else matters.

118
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,670
And then we'll all look back
at this moment right now

119
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,889

The flashlights,
the rebar, the rope.

124
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,112
You lower them off the wall
a good distance apart,

125
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,064
maybe spin them.

126
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:24,117
That way, the walkers
are drawn to each one

127
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,035
and you open up a path.

128
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,409
Now you're gearing up.

129

Hmm?

132
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:51,427
Or you just get slowed
down by one of them

133
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,262

deal with all of them?

I wouldn't call it that.

149

So what you told everyone...

150
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,702
that was just bullshit?

151
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,038
No. If they all went in
and raided the pantry

152
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,542
and everyone knew it, saw it,

153
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,711
then that would be the end.

One person, and no
one ever would know.

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,922
So, why not me?

157
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:34,807
I stopped that little run
at the bank.

158
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,309
I deserve a reward.

159
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,762
One last celebration.

160
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,815

00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,151
I think she went over the wall
just before the herd came

183
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,604
and now she's trapped out there.

184
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,356
What makes you think
she isn't dead?

185
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:14,607
<i>Come on, man.</i>

186
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,162
(scoffs)

187
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,200
Look...

188
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:25,701
I'll go find her.

189
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,503
I just need your help.

190
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,705
- If you maybe climb up--
- I'm not helping you, Carl.

191
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,759
This isn't for me.

192
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,761
It's for Enid.

193
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,598
- Your friend.
- My girlfriend.

194
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,466
Or, I mean, 'cause she
was anyway, right?

195
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,767
So you want to just
leave her out there?

196
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,386
I told her to stop
going over the wall,

197
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,137
I told her there's
bad people out there

198
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,889
and that it's stupid
and dangerous.

199
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,608
Not if you know
what you're doing.

200
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,480
Well, I'm not gonna let you go.

201
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,482
Carl.

202
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,284
Carl, you're not
going out there.

203
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,202
Back off.

204
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,073
All right.

205
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,794

206
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,079

207
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,248
<i>I'll tell your dad.</i>

208
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,584
He'll go out there to find you,
then other people will, too.

209
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,920
And then somebody's gonna die.

210
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,924
Huh?

211
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,679
You saved my life
and now I'm saving yours.

212
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,776
(steady beeping)

213
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,493
(sniffles)

214
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,837
Denise:
<i>Sorry.</i>

215
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,423
<i>Got away from me.</i>

216
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:11,026
- (sniffles)
- Tara:<i> You're still here.</i>

217
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:14,344
Don't.

218
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,513
'Kay.

219
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:18,155
Won't tell you
you're being brave, either.

220
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:26,273
He hasn't woken up.
His wound's infected.

221
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,275
I don't know
what the hell to do,

222
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:31,695
so it doesn't really
matter what I'm being.

223
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,697
Yeah, but you're still here.

224
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,451
Why are you here?

225
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:38,869
My head hurts.

226
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,924
On a scale
of one to 10, how bad?

227
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,876
I'm lying.

228
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,595
I'm just checking on you.

229
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,680
Well...

230
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,801
here I am.

231
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:58,271
(chuckles)
Clueless on the floor.

232
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:02,109
You patched people up.

233
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:05,145
You're helping
make things better.

234
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:08,065
I think he's gonna die.

235
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:11,701
And I'm so scared about
what's happening in here

236
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:15,238
that I can't think about
what's happening out there.

237
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,574
<i>And that's actually good.</i>

238
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,577
And I don't know
what to do with that.

239
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,797
I just want him to live and
for the roamers to go away.

240
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,383
And for a doctor
to show up at the gates

241
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,085
so I can go back to my apartment

242
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:30,420
and keep reading
"War and Peace."

243
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:35,142
But here comes
the end of the world.

244
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:38,595
He's not dead yet.

245
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:40,931
I don't know about that.

246
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,237
<i>It's not like I don't feel it.</i>

247
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,858
You know, being afraid sucks.

00:20:55,998 --> 00:21:00,000

I used to not want to see...

253

the way things are.

254
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,370
It's not that I couldn't.

255
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:32,709
It's that I--
I didn't want to.

256
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,099
But this is what life
looks like now.

257
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:45,355
We have to see it.

258
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,307
We have to fight it.

259
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:54,231
If we don't fight, we die.

260

<i>(walkers banging)</i>

261
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:20,974
Maggie: <i>I thought you said
we weren't going over.</i>

262
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,226
We're not.

263
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,011
We're going under.

264
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:29,683
This leads to a sewer

265
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,234
that was part of
the old neighborhood

266
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:34,571
that was here before
they built this up.

267
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:37,490
It'll take us under the wall...

268
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:43,613
(grunts)
...and hopefully past the walkers.

269
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,582
Thanks...

270
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:48,368
but I'm going
on my own from here.

271
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,621
- Maggie...
- No.

272
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:53,373
Please.

273
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:59,095
I can't-- I can't watch more
names go up on that wall.

- Maggie: If he's alive--
- Aaron: If?

276
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:07,804
He told Michonne
he would've found

277
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:10,140
some way to signal us
if he got out.

278
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:13,777
If he's alive or he's hurt
or trapped, maybe taken.

279
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,946
If he's alive, he needs my help.

280
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:19,482
That's why I'm doing this.

281
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,701
And if he's dead, I don't
want to be waiting on him.

282
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,740
None of this is your fault.
You don't need to do this.

283
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:32,662
People are dead.

284
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,297
I was a part of that.

285
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,168
And I have to live with that.

286
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:49,429
I haven't been down here
since the beginning.

Oh.

This ladder must've
fallen a long time ago.

she used to sneak

spend time out there.

00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,577
You know, I don't know why.
She just wanted to.

But, um...

331
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:08,531
I think she went out
there after the attack.

We don't know where she is.

Carl wanted to try.

00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,432
I stopped him. I told him
I'd tell you if he did.

I don't know.

342
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,188

How is he?

361
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,475
Ahem.

362
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,477
What is it?

363
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,231
It's the end of the world.

364
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,235
No, it's not.

365
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,157
Yeah, being afraid sucks.

366

<i>(water splashing)</i>

367
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:47,023
We're still too close.

368
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,358
We just have to get through a
few of them, then we're gone.

369
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,110
No.

370
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:53,362
You ready?

371
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:54,864
No, we can't.

<i>(walkers growling)</i>

373

You can stay.
I'll go.

374
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,337
No.

375
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,790
No!

376
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,092
- Maggie.
- It's over!

377

(growling)

378
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,886
I burned his last picture of him

379
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:19,222
because I said I wasn't
gonna need it anymore.

380
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:21,307
Because I was never gonna
be away from him again.

(snarling)

382
00:31:25,947 --> 00:31:27,613
I'm pregnant.

383
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:32,902
He didn't want me to go
out there and I said yes.

384
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:35,571
And if I would've gone...

385
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:38,324
if I was with him,
maybe I could've helped him.

386
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:42,411
I don't know if he's alive.

387
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:48,050
He would've shown me by now.
That's what Michonne said.

388
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:54,674
I just want to see his face.

389
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:56,926
I can't.

390
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,513
I don't get to know
what will happen.

391
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:02,098
I won't get to know
why it happened,

392
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,267
what I did right or wrong.

393
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,571
Not now.

394
00:32:10,108 --> 00:32:13,159
I have to live with that.
You do, too.

395
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:29,175

398

No, Sam.

399
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,724
Why?

400
00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:47,610

401

402

Why?

403
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:56,819
I just...

404
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,910
it didn't change up here.

405
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:08,881
(sighs, clears throat)

406
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:13,386
Well, I'm more than halfway up,

407
00:33:13,388 --> 00:33:16,556
so technically I'm upstairs.

408
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,342
You can come here and you
won't be downstairs.

409
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:25,598
No, it's okay, then.

He must have been under there.

I want to live.

00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:22,848

They don't need me, Rick.

<i>(banging continues)</i>

435

it's worth mentioning

that Aaron, Erin,

I'm your relief.

I thought Carol was up.

445

She was. I volunteered
to take her place.

446

You know, I never got
a chance to say it, but...

was Glenn.

We don't know
if he's still out there.

459

Rick, it already has.

466
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:40,879
They could still be alive.

We're not moving past that.

there wasn't a future.
