1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,206
(Door creaks)

2
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,527
(Cries)

3
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:06,854
(Clattering)

4
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,686
(Whimpers)

5
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:26,854
(Light fixture squeals)

6
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,490
(Sobs)

7
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,932
(Skull cracking)

8
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,486
<i>(Woman) God, watch
over my daughter.</i>

9
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,286
<i>Keep her from the path of sin.</i>

10
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,163
Deliver her from the evil of Satan...

11
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:46,484
...and all his demons.

12
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,811
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

13
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,254
Amen.

14
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,007
<i>(Woman) I wish you didn't
have to go so far.</i>

15
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:02,326
<i>(Girl) Don't worry,
I'm gonna be fine.</i>

16
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,172
It's just college.

17
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:07,685
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you.

18
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,567
(Knock on door)

19
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,614
(Knock on door)

20
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,492
All right, already, I'm comin'.

21
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,490
- What?
- Erica?

22
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,253
- Yeah.
- I'm Angie.

23
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,252
Your new roommate?

24
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:59,765
Oh, hey. Oh, yeah.
OK, come on in.

25
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,450
I thought you were supposed
to be here tomorrow night.

26
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,055
Well, I'm pretty sure I
said the twenty-fourth.

27
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:11,326
Doesn't matter. You're here now, right?
Here's the quick tour.

28
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,445
Living room. Kitchen.

29
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,290
Bedroom.

30
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,405
My side. Your side.

31
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,810
And we'll talk about the closet later.

32
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,693
Didn't you say in the email
that there was a bed?

33
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,852
(Yawns) There was. However, the
bitch that lived here before you,

34
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:38,205
decided last minute that she was gonna
take it, even though it wasn't hers.

35
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,769
You'll have to crash on the couch
until you find one.

36
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,612
I don't really have money to buy one.

37
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,089
We'll talk about it tomorrow, OK?

38
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,013
OK.

39
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,766
The apartment is great. Mm-hm.

40
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,413
My roommate?

41
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:59,286
She's, she's really nice.

42
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,891
No, I haven't had a chance to look yet.

43
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:07,286
I'm sure there's a church close by here
somewhere, yes.

44
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,490
- I promise.
- (Squealing)

45
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,125
Mom, I have to go now.

46
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,291
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

47
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,134
(Squealing)

48
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:31,887
Sorry.

49
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:34,085
Should watch where I'm goin'.

50
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,484
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Excuse me.

51
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,690
(Whispers) Hail Mary full of grace.

52
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,774
Be careful.

53
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,851
That's so sad.

54
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,294
Yup.

55
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,769
Table... Desk...

56
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:22,964
Motorcycle.

57
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,007
Sell your eggs.
Where are all the friggin' beds?

58
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,647
What do you think happened to her?

59
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:30,732
Who knows?
Last year, this girl went missing.

60
00:07:30,775 --> 00:07:33,164
Her mom was on the news,
the police did a full manhunt.

61
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:36,764
Turns out she moved to Colorado with
her boyfriend and just didn't tell anyone.

62
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,294
It happens all the time.

63
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,732
Course, they did find some girl
down in Redding all hacked up last month.

64
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,652
Did they ever catch the guy?

65
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:48,334
I never heard anything
about it if they did.

66
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,684
Not one fucking bed -
are you kidding me?

67
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,090
Every time I come up here,
there's like a million of 'em.

68
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,008
- You find one?
- No, it's for a job babysitting.

69
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:00,888
- That's a Montague area code.
- What does that mean?

70
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:03,005
It's out in farm country.
It's the boonies.

71
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,808
Oh.
Well, I'm gonna check it out anyway.

72
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:09,814
Suit yourself. There another one of
these boards on the other side of campus.

73
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,607
Let's go see if there's any beds on it.

74
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:23,884
(Teacher) Now, here we have a painting
by Hans Aachen,

75
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:27,291
entitled Saint George Slaying the Dragon.

76
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:30,850
Now, Saint George
is the patron saint of England,

77
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:36,686
and is venerated throughout Christendom
for his example of bravery,

78
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:39,124
in the defence of the poor
and the downtrodden.

79
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:43,168
Keep in mind that during
this era of religious artistry,

80
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:48,335
that dragons were not just
the mere machinations of evil

81
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,764
derived from the minds
of simple village folk,

82
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:56,287
but were in fact, symbolic
representations of the devil himself.

83
00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:01,170
In this particular picture,
Saint George slays the dragon.

84
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:05,527
Once again,
displaying the classic archetype

85
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:11,047
that good will defeat evil
and God will defeat... Satan.

86
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:15,293
Good. Now, on to the works
of Evelyn Munyan.

87
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,530
Hi, I was calling about
the babysitting job.

88
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:22,774
Seven twenty-four Lancaster Road.

89
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:27,493
Got it.
OK. I'll see you in a few.

90
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:02,053
(Coughs)

91
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,369
Hey, there.
You must be Angie.

92
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,730
- Angie, I'm Jim Stanton.
- Hi.

93
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,767
We appreciate you coming out here.
Know what a long drive it is.

94
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,965
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.
- (Door opens)

95
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:21,291
You made it. (Laughs)

96
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,803
Hi. Violet Stanton.

97
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:28,323
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,094
And this... must be Sam.

99
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:34,207
He's a little shy at first,
but that's just till you get to know him.

100
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:37,372
- Isn't that right, Sam?
- That's quite a cowboy outfit you have there.

101
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:41,294
Yeah, he never takes the thing off.
He even sleeps in it most nights.

102
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,087
- Mm-hm.
- Really? (Laughs)

103
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:47,208
Well, if I had a cool cowboy hat like that,
I probably wouldn't take it off either.

104
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:51,134
I did the same thing when I was his age.
I had this ballerina outfit I wore all the time.

105
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:53,689
- (Laughs)
- Oh, I love ballet. Do you still dance?

106
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:56,932
Actually, I never danced.
I just liked to wear the outfit.

107
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,408
- (Laughs)
- Oh. (Laughs)

108
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:02,243
So, um, on the phone, you said something
about needing a sitter for a gathering?

109
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:05,446
Oh, yeah. Well, the gathering is when
all the local ranchers get together,

110
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:08,373
and help each other sort out
the new calves and brand 'em.

111
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:11,088
- Then they get vaccinated and wormed.
- Oh, wow.

112
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,445
We mostly work weekends, so that's when
we'd need you to watch Sam the most.

113
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,974
That's perfect.

114
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,051
You'll have to forgive the disaster zone.

115
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:21,326
We are under construction, as you can see,
so we're a little upside down.

116
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,128
- Would you like some homemade lemonade?
- That'd be great.

117
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,006
OK. Be right back.

118
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:32,892
So, are you restoring the entire house?

119
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,284
Uh, one room at a time.

120
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:39,293
I really didn't think
it was gonna be this much work.

121
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,485
Hm. How long have you been doing it?

122
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:44,607
I thought we were gonna be finished
with the whole house in two months,

123
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:50,525
but with plumbing and foundation, let's
just say we're going on just over a year now.

124
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,133
- Wow.
- I know. (Laughs)

125
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,164
Thank you.

126
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:56,127
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.

127
00:12:56,175 --> 00:13:00,487
I'm eighteen. I'm in my first year
at Adams Community College.

128
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:02,253
Oh, great. What are you studying?

129
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:05,173
- Art history.
- Nice. Where are you from?

130
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:07,331
I just left Bakersfield
for the first time.

131
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,287
Bakersfield. Don't they have
a community college in Bakersfield?

132
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:15,250
Oh, yeah, they do. Um, but the art
history programme is better here.

133
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,083
Really?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

134
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,534
No, just me and my mom.

135
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:22,213
Mm.

136
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,325
Hm.

137
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,365
- May I use your restroom?
- Oh, sure. Of course.

138
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:33,612
The sink is broken in the one downstairs,
so use the one at the top of the stairs.

139
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,448
(Gasps)

140
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:41,008
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

141
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:43,853
No, not at all.
I just wasn't expecting...

142
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,289
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's no problem. (Laughs)

143
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:50,008
Hey, honey, you know
where those small bungees are?

144
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:04,087
(Sighs) Get a grip, Ange.

145
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,413
Hi, Sam.

146
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,608
(Whispers) I think she's great.

147
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,931
Oh, hi.
So, we have talked it over,

148
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:30,854
and decided that we would love
for you to watch Sam on Friday night,

149
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:33,284
- if that's OK with you.
- Yeah, Friday will be fine.

150
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:36,407
Terrific. I'd like to take my
beautiful wife out on the town

151
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,923
before things get a little
bit busy around here.

152
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,694
Are you stalking me?

153
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,329
- Excuse me?
- I'm the guy you ran into the other night.

154
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,854
Oh. Hi.

155
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,726
Looks like we're neighbours.

156
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:10,165
I live in the building next door.
I'm Rick.

157
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:11,204
Angie.

158
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,449
Nice to meet you, Angie.

159
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,723
You, too.

160
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:18,085
Hey, uh, maybe we could get a
bite to eat later or something.

161
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,727
- I have to study.
- Ah.

162
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:23,211
That's cool. I probably should, too.
Maybe some other time.

163
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,485
Hi.

164
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:41,332
Hey!

165
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,491
Angie, this is Hal.

166
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,093
Yeah.

167
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,284
It's nice to meet you.

168
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,291
(Sighs) Have a seat.

169
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,364
Hey, you want some?

170
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,935
No. I'm OK, thank you.

171
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:02,844
So, uh, you need a bed, huh?

172
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,489
- Yeah.
- You can totally have mine.

173
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:10,294
Absolutely.
It's like the coolest bed ever.

174
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,132
- Really?
- Yeah.

175
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:17,925
That bed has seen more action
than you could believe.

176
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:21,172
It's like good luck
or something like that.

177
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,604
That's... That's great. (Laughs)

178
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:29,844
You can come over to my place on
Saturday, and I'll help you move it.

179
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:32,614
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

180
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:37,649
- Oh. Who the...
- You dropped some on your shirt. (Laughs)

181
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:41,813
- (Erica laughs)
- Are you sure you don't want some?

182
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:46,212
Really, thank you. But um,
I have to get going. I'll see you later,

183
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,927
and thanks again for the bed.

184
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:51,449
(Laughs)

185
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:27,374
(Door opens)

186
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,454
- Hey.
- Hey.

187
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:35,010
Twelve years of Catholic school,
church every Sunday.

188
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,684
Altar boy - the whole shebang.
Couldn't get out of it if I tried.

189
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:41,044
(Tyres screeching)

190
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:45,527
D'you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

191
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,167
Depends on the question.

192
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,248
Why are you always so jumpy?

193
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:54,247
I don't know. I'm not usually like this.

194
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:58,447
It's just... Do you ever feel
like someone's watching you?

195
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,173
What, do you mean like a guardian angel?

196
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:05,925
No, like... like someone's stalking you.

197
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:10,884
But...
Someone's stalking you?

198
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:16,923
You've been here for what, like a week and
you already have a stalker? I'm so jealous.

199
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:20,684
(Laughs) I don't know.
It just feels like someone is.

200
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:25,728
Maybe it's just being away from
home and all, that's got me nuts.

201
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:28,448
It sounds like you've
got a lot on your mind.

202
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,963
Yeah. I guess I do.

203
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,404
- How's your vanilla?
- It's good.

204
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,286
Yeah?

205
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,767
Nah, chocolate's still better.

206
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,289
Well, my stalking duties end here.

207
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,247
Wait. I thought I was stalking you.

208
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:50,287
Right.
Sorry, I keep getting that part mixed up.

209
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:53,334
What are you doin' tomorrow night?

210
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,286
Oh, I have to work.

211
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:01,447
Maybe, um, maybe we could do something
on Saturday, though?

212
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,888
I'd like that.

213
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,174
Well, good night. (Laughs)

214
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:09,648
Good night.

215
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:47,771
- Angie, you are the... twenty-seventh?
- That's right.

216
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:51,364
...female student that we've spoken to
since Rebecca Miller went missing,

217
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,610
and you all have
every reason to be concerned.

218
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,964
Now, we've put extra squad cars
on the streets,

219
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:59,371
and I know that campus security
is very aware of the situation.

220
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,007
Why would someone put this on my door?

221
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:03,728
People have been putting
these things up everywhere.

222
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,289
My door was the only one
in the entire building.

223
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,252
Let me give you my card.

224
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,084
If this guy tries anything, you call
me up and we'll come straightaway.

225
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:17,410
- Thank you.
- OK.

226
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:50,526
(Engine fails to start)

227
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:54,332
(Sighs) No!

228
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:58,770
Come on!

229
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,367
(Gasps)

230
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:06,371
- Car trouble?
- Yeah, kind of.

231
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,252
Pop the hood. I'll take a look at it.

232
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:12,173
Geez, I am gonna be so late!

233
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,648
- (Sighs)
- I'll tell you what.

234
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,767
I'll give you a ride, and then I'll
come back and take a look at your car.

235
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:20,490
- Are you sure? It's kinda far.
- It'll be my pleasure.

236
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:31,566
You weren't kidding
when you said this place was out here.

237
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:34,209
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate you doing this.

238
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:37,088
Don't be sorry. I'm happy to do it.

239
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,853
Thanks.

240
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,328
You're welcome.

241
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:55,726
So, uh, call me in a few, and I'll let you
know if you need to take it to a mechanic.

242
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,367
You're sweet.

243
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:07,925
- Remind me to offer to fix your car more often.
- (Laughs)

244
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,451
- Hi, Mr Stanton.
- Hi, Angie.

245
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:17,609
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No, just a friend.

246
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:20,249
I had a little car trouble,
so he gave me a ride.

247
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,489
Huh. Nice friend.

248
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:23,332
Yeah. He is a nice friend.

249
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,605
- Hm.
- (Honking)

250
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:33,488
Is there any chance
you could give me a ride home?

251
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:34,934
I don't see why not.

252
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:38,324
Psst. (Come on up.)

253
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,969
- Ah, here. I'll take that.
- Thanks.

254
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:54,365
You weren't kidding
about the cowboy outfit.

255
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,610
Like I said,
he never takes the thing off.

256
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,294
You wouldn't believe what a pain it is
to get him to take a bath.

257
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:00,848
(Laughs)

258
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:03,887
Sam couldn't stop talking about you
after you left the other day.

259
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,369
Really?
I wasn't sure he even liked me.

260
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:08,406
- Oh, no, no, no, no, he loves you.
- Oh.

261
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:11,367
It's just, you know, he gets very quiet
when he first meets people.

262
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:12,643
Oh.

263
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,892
OK, so let me just show you
a few things.

264
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:17,926
Here is the TV remote.
Sam is a heavy sleeper,

265
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:20,205
but you might want to keep it low,
just in case.

266
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:23,884
And here is the phone with all the contact
numbers that you could possibly need.

267
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,290
- Keys to the Jeep, in case you need it.
- Got it.

268
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,803
Help yourself to anything
in the refrigerator,

269
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,244
but the bottom row is Sam's.
He's on a special diet,

270
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,889
so don't feed him anything
that's not in those containers,

271
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:35,448
just in case he wakes up hungry.

272
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:37,053
So, we all set?

273
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:39,768
I think so. Are you sure
you don't have any questions?

274
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:41,214
Oh, come on. She's fine.

275
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,405
- We're running late anyway.
- OK, OK.

276
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,333
- Do you have any idea when you'll be back?
- We shouldn't be gone

277
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,128
more than three or four hours.
Just make yourself at home.

278
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,927
- We'll see you later.
- Have a good night.

279
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:53,091
- OK, thanks.
- Don't forget to call.

280
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,571
(Electrical static)

281
00:24:49,895 --> 00:24:51,487
(Electrical buzzing)

282
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:02,613
(Flips switch on and off)

283
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:09,486
Don't start playing games with yourself.
It's just an old house.

284
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,454
(Beeps)

285
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,685
- There's a heart attack waiting to happen.
- (Microwave pings)

286
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:05,407
(Phone)

287
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:12,806
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

288
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:16,734
Hey there, me. How's the babysitting going?
The kid driving you crazy yet?

289
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,767
- No, it's like he's not even here.
- <i>I guess that's good, right?</i>

290
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:22,887
(Laughs) I just wanted to let you know
you don't have to come get me.

291
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,493
Mr Stanton's gonna give me a ride.

292
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:27,288
Oh. I was actually looking forward to it.

293
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:32,726
In fact,
you called right at the moment of truth.

294
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,174
(Engine starts)

295
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,251
Oh, I'm good.

296
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:40,527
<i>Your starter connection was bad. I took it apart,</i>
<i>put it back together and reconnected it.</i>

297
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:42,133
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

298
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,972
So, uh, I'll see you later?

299
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:45,448
<i>OK, I'll see you later.</i>

300
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,573
(Phone)

301
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:02,132
- Stanton residence.
<i>- (Crackling/opera singing)</i>

302
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:04,530
- Hello?
<i>- (Opera singing)</i>

303
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:07,726
- Rick, is that you?
<i>- (Opera singing/crackling)</i>

304
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:11,484
I'm sorry. Whoever this is, I can't hear you.
I'm gonna hang up now.

305
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:17,212
(Ringing)

306
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,285
- Hello?
<i>- (Crackling/opera singing)</i>

307
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:35,734
<i>(Opera singing)</i>

308
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:40,847
(Dial tone)

309
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:49,091
- (Ringing)
- <i>That was fast.</i>

310
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,534
Did you just try calling me?

311
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,088
No.

312
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:54,410
- <i>Oh. OK.</i>
- Are you OK?

313
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,527
I'm fine. Someone just tried calling,
and I thought it might be you.

314
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,054
No, wasn't me.

315
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,245
OK, well, I will call you later.

316
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:02,694
<i>OK.</i>

317
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:07,606
<i>(Opera singing)</i>

318
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,372
Maybe a little TV will help.

319
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:29,768
<i>(Loud TV) Woo-woo-woo-woo, ha-ha!</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.</i>

320
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:31,646
<i>Thank you...</i>

321
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:34,163
It would be a good idea
not to leave it on at full volume,

322
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:36,854
if you don't want it played too loud.

323
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:39,125
I hope that didn't wake him.

324
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,008
<i>(Opera singing)</i>

325
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:45,374
<i>(Singing stops)</i>

326
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:48,647
(Door opening and closing)

327
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:10,293
He does sleep like a rock.

328
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:13,487
(Tinkling)

329
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:17,294

(Gasps)

333
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,286
Oh, God, you scared me.

334
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,166
I'm sorry, did I wake you up?

335
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:08,933
Hungry.

336
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,684
Oh. OK, let's go get
you something to eat.

337
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,009
Your mom said you can
only eat the food on the bottom...

338
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:31,732
You want me to heat some of this up?

339
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:46,011
Diced red meat.
Very rare diced red meat.

340
00:30:47,015 --> 00:30:48,926
Let's get a different one.

341
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,489
I guess it's diced rare meat.

342
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:16,011
- (Microwave pings)
- (Sizzling)

343
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:23,609
Are you sure
you're supposed to have this?

344
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,534
OK.

345
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:33,932
Do you want some ketchup
or something?

346
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,966
Careful, you're gonna burn your...

347
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:56,173
(Phone)

348
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:11,574
Hello?

349
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:15,967
Please stop calling here.

350
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:31,130
(Door handle rattles)

351
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:32,893
Did you hear that?

352
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:02,088
(Rattles handle)

353
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,208
(Rattles handle)

354
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:37,292
(Rattles handle)

355
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:47,614
(Phone)

356
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,286
Good evening, Montague Dispatch.

357
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,094
One moment, please.

358
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,335
Chief... Line one.

359
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:02,931
- Dinneli here.
<i>- Hi, this is Angie. I came by your office today.</i>

360
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,966
Oh, yeah.
Hi, Angie, how you doin'?

361
00:34:05,015 --> 00:34:08,530
<i>I'm not sure. I'm babysitting at
seven-twenty-four Lancaster Road.</i>

362
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:12,170
- That's the Stanton place. I know it.
- I think there's someone outside the house.

363
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:13,443
<i>Did you see someone?</i>

364
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:15,963
Not exactly.
I just keep hearing strange noises,

365
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,734
and I keep getting
these phone calls where no one talks.

366
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:22,085
- How would you describe the noises?
- I don't know. Like locks rattling,

367
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,968
- like there's someone outside the door.
- Angie, calm down.

368
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,324
Now, did you see someone outside?

369
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,331
No, it just feels like there is.

370
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:34,130
OK, well, I'm just about to make my rounds,
so I will swing by and check it out, OK?

371
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,574
Thank you.

372
00:34:43,655 --> 00:34:45,327
Sam?

373
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,613
Sam?

374
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:56,884
- Sam?
- (Footstep)

375
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:11,126
(Laughter)

376
00:35:18,095 --> 00:35:19,847
Sam, are you getting back in bed?

377
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:24,286
I think you should brush
your teeth... first.

378
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:40,493
Sam?

379
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:46,648
Where are you?

380
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:03,527
Are you playing a game with me?

381
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:17,647
Come on, Sam! I need you to get back
in bed before your parents get home.

382
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:19,492
(Laughter)

383
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:22,891
Hey, buddy, where are you goin'?

384
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,174
Sam?

385
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:53,048
(Door creaking)

386
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:26,247
Sam!

387
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:32,289
Sam, I'm done playing now, OK?
You have to get in bed.

388
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,526
I'm serious. This isn't funny.
You need to go to sleep.

389
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:53,974
Sam?

390
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:01,690
(Lights buzz)

391
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,253
Sam, are you in here?

392
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,770
It's past your bedtime.

393
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:20,487
Your mommy is gonna be
very, very upset with you.

394
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:28,487
Do you hear me, young man?

395
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:34,447
(Screams)

396
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:39,134
(Phone)

397
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:47,894
Hello?

398
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:50,374
Who is this?

399
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,684
(Phone)

400
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:01,203
Hey, you ruined my surprise.
I'm about 20 minutes away.

401
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,530
Oh, thank God!
I'm freaking out right now.

402
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,930
- Hey, why, what's wrong?
<i>- This guy keeps calling,</i>

403
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:09,126
<i>the kid is playing hide-and-seek</i>
<i>and the house is making strange noises.</i>

404
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:10,893
- Whoa. Angie, slow down.
- (Horn)

405
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,887
What's your problem, buddy?

406
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,568
Hey, Angie, I gotta pull
over for a second. Hold on.

407
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:19,014
(Horn)

408
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:23,775
Rick? Hello?

409
00:39:23,815 --> 00:39:26,283
- (Dial tone)
- (Whispers) Oh great.

410
00:39:28,895 --> 00:39:30,453

411
00:39:40,455 --> 00:39:42,491

(Clattering)

417
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:52,968
I need a weapon.

418
00:42:56,935 --> 00:42:58,334
(Footsteps approach)

419
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,054
(Door creaks)

420
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,247
- (Grunts)
- Ahh!

421
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:56,654
Sam?

422
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,053
Sam, wait!

423
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,454
(Screams)

424
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:08,124
Help, somebody!
Let go of me!

425
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:09,403
(Grunts)

426
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:12,563
(Vase shattering)

427
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:25,814
(Glass breaking)

428
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:42,688
Sam? Sam, where are you?!

429
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:47,446
Sam, come on, we have to go!
(Whimpers)

430
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:50,288
Sam!

431
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:01,247
Sam, please, I know you're scared.

432
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:09,287
Look, I'm scared, too, Sam,
but we have to go.

433
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,367
- Sam, please!
- (Clatter)

434

(Cries)

436
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:21,286
Why? (Sobs)

437
00:45:23,415 --> 00:45:25,292
(Creaking)

438
00:45:25,335 --> 00:45:26,529
Oh.

439
00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:28,247
Oh, Sam, thank God!

440
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:32,413
I need you to come with me, OK?
Come on.

441
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:38,814
Come on.

442
00:45:40,695 --> 00:45:43,163
- We're just gonna go for a little drive, OK?
- Hungry.

443
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:46,412
I know. We'll get you something
to eat later, OK, sweetie?

444
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:51,209
Oh no, I left the keys in the house.

445
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:55,173
OK, we're just gonna run inside,
we're gonna grab the keys,

446
00:45:55,215 --> 00:45:57,092
and we're gonna get out of here, OK?

447
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:03,646
(Door creaking)

448
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:16,293
(It's gonna be OK.)

449
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:22,687
Sam, I need you to wait here
until I get back, OK? OK?

450
00:46:23,535 --> 00:46:25,093
Wait here.

451
00:47:00,455 --> 00:47:03,288
- (Screams) Evil! Evil!
- Sam, run!

452
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:06,486

- (Grunts) Evil!
- (Groans)

461
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,167
Let go! (Grunts)

462

464
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:54,692
Sam, are you all right?

465
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,250
(Oh, my God!)

466
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:18,887
Hungry.

467
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:24,654
God help me.

468
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,765
(Gasps)

469
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:36,449
Oh, my God, Sam, no.

470
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:38,565
Oh, God, baby, are you OK?

471
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,492
Another goddamn priest.

472
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,530
Son of a bitch,
this is Father Nicoletta!

473
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:48,487
- Thought I killed that fucker in Romania.
- Well, I guess you didn't.

474
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:50,014
You are one tough old bastard.

475
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:53,491
Last time I saw you, you had an axe
stickin' out of the top of your head.

476
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:55,890
- Jim, how did he find us?
- I don't know. Goddamn!

477
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:57,926
(Groans)

478
00:48:57,975 --> 00:49:01,172
Oh, oh, that's just great.
He's still alive. Just great!

479
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:04,525
- (Moans)
- Come on, baby, let's get out of here.

480
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,611
- (Groans)
- (Whimpers)

481
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:10,844
Well, he's dead now.
They're like fuckin' rats.

482
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:15,015
- (Whimpers)
- Ohh!

483
00:49:16,055 --> 00:49:18,489
Hold on there, Missy.

484
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,446
You're not going anywhere.

485
00:49:22,975 --> 00:49:24,374
Sorry.

486
00:49:24,855 --> 00:49:26,083
(Thud)

487
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:28,526
(Scrubbing sound)

488
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,085
Vi... Stop.

489
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:37,690
We covered our tracks so well.

490
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,774
How did he find us, Jim?

491
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:48,172
I don't know. I don't know. But where
there's one, there's gonna be more.

492
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,287
- I thought we finally had a home for once.
- (Sighs)

493
00:49:53,295 --> 00:49:55,604
- (Sighs)
- (Sighs)

494
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:05,807
There's only one thing we can do.
We have to leave tonight.

495
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:08,005
And go where?

496
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:11,604
We have people in Colorado. We can
stay with them till we get our place set up.

497
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:15,773
Hon... Listen, it's gonna be OK.

498
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:19,854
(Sighs) OK.

499
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:23,171
I'll pack our things and you go
prepare Sam's food for the trip.

500
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:27,493
OK. Wait, there's only one thing -
the girl we bagged tonight,

501
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,253
she's still got the drugs in her system.

502
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:33,083
Do your best to bleed her out.
We need both of them.

503
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:38,330
We can't leave a trail of dead bodies
all the way to Colorado.

504
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:42,894
OK.

505
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,694
Come here, honey.

506
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,695
(Grunts)

507
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:33,733
(Moans)

508
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:39,124
- (Door opening)
- (Footsteps)

509
00:51:39,175 --> 00:51:41,052
(Sighs)

510
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:47,334
Ah!

511
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:49,568
Yeah.

512
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:00,334
(Sighs)

513
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:04,286
One hell of a night, huh?

514
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:07,933
Let me guess.

515
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,284
You're probably wondering
right about now...

516
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:15,006
...what the hell's goin' on. (Laughs)

517
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:17,091
Bottom line, Angie...

518
00:52:19,015 --> 00:52:20,812
...we gotta feed Sam.

519
00:52:22,495 --> 00:52:23,894
Only problem is...

520
00:52:27,575 --> 00:52:30,328
...he only likes female flesh.

521
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:36,451
And it can't be any female flesh -

522
00:52:36,495 --> 00:52:40,090
it has to be good, clean
wholesome female flesh -

523
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:44,686
which, as you can imagine,
is not that easy to come by.

524
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:52,968
Ah.

525
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,367
And you can't just go around
grabbing up a whole flock of girls,

526
00:52:58,415 --> 00:53:02,488
cos then the local people start gettin'
suspicious. Then you gotta move again.

527
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:18,454
Last time we went out...
we took Sam with us - big mistake.

528
00:53:22,175 --> 00:53:24,530
Had to grab
a local girl named Rebecca.

529
00:53:25,935 --> 00:53:28,847
You know, I really hate to do that.

530
00:53:40,975 --> 00:53:43,694
That is why we had to
get you to baby-sit.

531
00:53:44,295 --> 00:53:48,288
Then eventually, of course,
you'd have to find out about Sam.

532
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:54,290
But then again, you're a nice
clean girl, aren't you, Angie?

533
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:56,690
(Jim laughs)

534
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:02,925
You know... (Laughs) It is so nice
to have somebody out here to talk to.

535
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:06,490
(Laughs) I'm always out here alone
doing this. Always.

536
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:12,284
My father...
used to have a meat packing plant.

537
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:19,092
Every summer I worked there
till I turned eighteen.

538
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,285
Yeah. (Laughs)

539
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:27,653
You know, I haven't really gotten used to
slaughtering human beings, though.

540
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:30,163
Hence the cut marks.

541
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:01,091
You know what Sam's
favourite cut of meat is?

542
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:06,528
No? The latissimus dorsi.

543
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:10,807
Can you believe that? Yeah, most people
would think it'd be the gluteus maximus,

544
00:55:10,855 --> 00:55:13,244
cos of the high fat content,
but no, no,

545
00:55:13,295 --> 00:55:17,447
he has to have this little
thin slice of beef right here.

546
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:18,894
Go figure.

547
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:24,893
Never tasted either one of 'em myself, so I
couldn't really tell you if they're any good or not.

548
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:35,085
Goddamn it, I hate giving 'em drugs like that.
Fuckin' pisses me off.

549
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:37,365
This is not the way I do things,
Angie, normally.

550
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:42,364
I take the girls, I give 'em health food,
put 'em away for a couple days. Lots of water.

551
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:46,124
Flushes all the drugs right out of
their system. Now, that is good food.

552
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:51,295
But, I gotta get on the road, so...
Not that it really affects him that much.

553
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:56,734
(Sighs)
But nothin' seems to affect him much.

554
00:55:58,215 --> 00:56:01,287
Well... priests and churches.

555
00:56:02,575 --> 00:56:05,294
But then again,
he's not eatin' them, is he?

556
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,207
All right.

557
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:15,254
There.

558
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,294
(Girl screams)

559
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,534
Oh, come on.

560
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:34,773
Oh, hey. No, no, no.

561
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,648
- (Whimpers)
- You don't have to worry. No, listen.

562
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,687
I'm gonna hit you right here
in the forehead, right here.

563
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:43,454
It's only gonna hurt for a split second.

564
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:45,690
See, it kills the brain,
leaves the heart pumpin'.

565
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,771
That way, I can drain
all the blood outta you.

566
00:56:47,815 --> 00:56:49,214
(Whimpers)

567
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,127
(Screams)

568
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,686
(Skull cracking)

569
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:09,168
(Screams)

570
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,887
Aw, no, no, no, no.

571
00:57:10,935 --> 00:57:13,654
No dying on me yet. Go ahead, breathe.

572
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:16,971
- Oh!
- You son of a bitch! I hope you rot in hell!

573
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:19,290
What the hell was that?
You know what?

574
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:24,204
I said it was nice to have you out here.
Guess what? It's not that nice. Jesus Christ!

575
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:27,247
Try to be a nice guy,
and that's the thanks I get.

576
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:32,970
Are you happy? She's probably
already started to coagulate!

577
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:36,604
(Hacking sound)

578
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:39,770
(Whimpers)

579
00:57:42,135 --> 00:57:43,568
(Thud)

580
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,848
(Thuds)

581
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:55,007
(Slashing sounds)

582
00:57:58,255 --> 00:58:00,325
(Squeaking)

583
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:19,854
(Grunts)

584
00:58:21,135 --> 00:58:22,329
(Sobs)

585
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:24,934
(Clatter)

586
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:34,053
(Trickling)

587
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,494
(Sobs)

588
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:39,484
(Sighs)

589
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:43,733
You know, this part used to bother me too,
when I first started.

590
00:58:43,775 --> 00:58:45,208
(Footsteps)

591
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,246
What are doing talking to her?

592
00:58:47,295 --> 00:58:49,251
- I thought you liked her.
- Are you serious?

593
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:52,526
Well, it's not like I'm out here
having sex with her or somethin'.

594
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:55,533
I didn't say that you were.
It's just you have to kill her in a minute.

595
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:57,611
Why talk to her - what is the point?

596
00:58:57,655 --> 00:59:00,533
Hey, I have asked you many times
to come out here and help me.

597
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:05,046
- Each time, your response has been, "No."
- You know that is not my thing.

598
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:08,246
Oh, and... and cutting girls
into. bite-sized pieces is my thing?

599
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,048
Look, I just came out here
to tell you that I'm done packing

600
00:59:11,095 --> 00:59:13,325
and whenever you're finished here,
we can leave.

601
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,684
Hey. (Sighs) Come here, Vi.

602
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:18,407
What?

603
00:59:19,415 --> 00:59:23,931
I'm sorry, OK?
This night has just got me all worked up.

604
00:59:23,975 --> 00:59:26,569
- Kiss?
- Hm.

605
00:59:32,855 --> 00:59:35,323
(Sighs) OK, back to work.

606
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:45,288
(Slicing)

607
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:28,130
- (Sawing)
- (Tearing sounds)

608
01:01:35,455 --> 01:01:36,934
(Sighs)

609
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,767
(Sighs)

610
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:42,294
One down, one to go.

611
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:46,535
You know, we really did like you
as a babysitter, Angie.

612
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:53,971
Hell, you saved Sam from that priest
while we were out gettin' him more food.

613
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:56,051
Not a lot of people would've done that.

614
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,804
Course, you didn't know Sam was the son
of the devil at the time, I'm assuming.

615
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:03,574
You didn't know, right?

616
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:07,253
I didn't think so.

617
01:02:12,655 --> 01:02:14,452
(Sighs)

618
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,974
(Clattering)

619
01:02:37,095 --> 01:02:40,883
Well, Angie... It's about that time.

620
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:45,289
Once again, I'm really sorry about this.

621
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:50,046
- (Whimpers)
- Don't move.

622
01:02:50,095 --> 01:02:54,805
Cos if I don't hit you right in the centre
of the forehead, I'm gonna injure you,

623
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,608
- and I really don't want you to be in any pain.
- (Whimpers)

624
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:05,734
(OK.)

625
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:12,454
(Siren)

626
01:03:15,535 --> 01:03:18,686
What the hell?
Did you call the cops?

627
01:03:23,015 --> 01:03:27,133
Don't make a sound, you understand me?
Cos I don't want to kill him,

628
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:29,928
and I really don't want to do you
without the hammer.

629
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:44,934
Good evening, Officer.

630
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:47,091
- How you doin'?
- OK.

631
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:48,568
How can we help you?

632
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:50,094
Sorry to bother you guys so late,

633
01:03:50,135 --> 01:03:54,925
but, um, I got a call from uh, the girl
who was babysitting for you, named Angie.

634
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:56,374
(Screams)

635
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:00,974
(Muffled cries)

636
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:03,131
- She left about a half an hour ago.
- Mm-hm.

637
01:04:03,175 --> 01:04:04,608
She in some sort of trouble?

638
01:04:04,655 --> 01:04:08,728
Well, she had called earlier and said
there was someone outside the house.

639
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:11,812
Really? That's funny. She didn't
mention anything to us about it.

640
01:04:11,855 --> 01:04:14,050
- She mention it to you, honey?
- No, not at all.

641
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:15,653
(Whimpers)

642
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:23,207
(Grunts)

643
01:04:29,015 --> 01:04:30,414
(Grunts)

644
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:35,847
Guess it was a false alarm.

645
01:04:36,935 --> 01:04:38,129
You folks have a good night.

646
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:40,131
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Thank you.

647
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:42,006
(Faint scream)

648
01:04:53,935 --> 01:04:55,334
(Grunts)

649
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:01,534
(Rattling)

650
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:31,933
(Sighs)

651
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:36,334
He knows.

652
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,445
All right, calm down.
He doesn't know anything.

653
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,367
Dispatch, can you run a plate for me?

654
01:05:47,975 --> 01:05:49,852
(Grunts)

655
01:05:51,215 --> 01:05:52,614
(Grunts)

656
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:57,694
What is he doing?

657
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:02,483
Probably trying to find out
what doughnut shop to go to. (Laughs)

658
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:07,288
- (Sighs)
- See?

659
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:08,563
OK, OK.

660
01:06:08,615 --> 01:06:11,288
I'm gonna finish the second girl.
Now, have Sam ready to go, OK?

661
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:13,212
- All right. OK.
- All right?

662
01:06:15,495 --> 01:06:17,087
(Grunts)

663
01:06:17,135 --> 01:06:18,534
(Door opening)

664
01:06:24,535 --> 01:06:25,934
(Door closing)

665
01:06:32,775 --> 01:06:33,844
(Screams)

666
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:37,374
(Groans)

667
01:06:38,455 --> 01:06:40,491
You bitch! You cut me!

668
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,730
How does it feel, asshole!

669
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,254
(Groans)

670
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:45,808
Ow!

671
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:48,894
(Groans)

672
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:03,892
(Groans)

673
01:07:05,895 --> 01:07:08,728
Come on, Angie...
there's nowhere to run!

674
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,094
(Groans)

675
01:07:31,495 --> 01:07:32,894
(Rattles handle)

676
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:38,731
(Groans)

677
01:08:15,815 --> 01:08:17,328
(Shrieks)

678
01:08:18,855 --> 01:08:20,652
It's all over now, Angie.

679
01:08:20,695 --> 01:08:22,208
(Screams)

680
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:24,648
Angie!

681
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:28,089
You're really making this harder
than it needs to be.

682
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:30,888
(Grunts)

683
01:08:36,975 --> 01:08:38,374
(Grunts)

684
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,093
Come on, Angie!

685
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:10,291
I didn't ask for this life, Angie.

686
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,286
It was set upon me.

687
01:09:15,335 --> 01:09:17,212
(Grunts)

688
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:21,168
You've seen the boy. You know the truth.

689
01:09:22,175 --> 01:09:23,767
(Sighs)

690
01:09:26,015 --> 01:09:29,291
How can you be in his presence
and not believe?

691
01:09:33,855 --> 01:09:36,085
Did you find your boyfriend, Angie?

692
01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:41,284
It's too bad he had to die for no reason.

693
01:09:43,015 --> 01:09:44,892
Sam just won't eat male flesh.

694
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:56,814
(Screams)

695
01:09:58,335 --> 01:09:59,927

(Grunts)

698
01:10:44,695 --> 01:10:47,289
I'm gonna bleed you slow - real slow!

699
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:49,893
(Grunts)

700
01:10:52,855 --> 01:10:54,254

(Clatter)

702
01:11:03,895 --> 01:11:05,294
Damn, that hurts!

705
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:14,490
Oh... Fuck.

706
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:16,810
I think you cut through a tendon.

707
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,254
(Sighs)

708
01:11:22,055 --> 01:11:23,886
Wake up!

709
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:26,966
- I want you to feel this!
- (Fuck you.)

710
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:29,085
Good, you're awake.

711
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:34,174
(Laughs)

712
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:36,445
- (Knife piercing flesh)

713
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,525
(Groans)

714
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:42,167
(Grunts)

715
01:11:44,215 --> 01:11:47,571
Tried to be a nice guy,
but you didn't like nice, did you?

716
01:11:47,615 --> 01:11:50,004
(Whimpers)

717
01:11:50,855 --> 01:11:52,846

(Panting)

721
01:12:01,695 --> 01:12:04,653
Good. Now the other one.

722
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,413
No. (Cries)

723
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,764
- (Gun hammer click)
- Drop it, asshole!

724
01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:12,494
(Clatter)

725
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:14,571
You got any more weapons on you,
son of a bitch?

726
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:16,651
- (Groans)
- Get on your knees, now!

727
01:12:16,695 --> 01:12:18,287
- Get on your knees.
- (Gasps)

728
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:20,246
How you doin', Chief?
All the way down.

729
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:27,813
- (Groans)
- Don't worry, Angie. I'll get you outta here.

730
01:12:30,655 --> 01:12:32,486
- Behind you!
- (Yells)

731
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:34,288
Aargh!

732
01:12:42,655 --> 01:12:44,088
(Cries)

733
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,694
(Violet grunts)

734
01:12:50,455 --> 01:12:51,808
(Groans)

735
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:55,208
(Angie screams)

736
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:58,533
(Gasps)

737
01:13:07,775 --> 01:13:08,924
(Grunts)

738
01:13:12,695 --> 01:13:14,094
Violet?

739
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:23,607

743
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:51,534
- No, no!

744
01:13:51,575 --> 01:13:55,124
- (Sobs)
- It's OK, it's OK. They're dead. They're dead.

745
01:13:58,295 --> 01:13:59,694
Come on.

746
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:12,291
My car's parked up on the main road.

747
01:14:12,335 --> 01:14:14,769
There's, there's keys in the truck.

748
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:18,171
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

749
01:14:40,535 --> 01:14:43,254
(Groans)

750
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:48,094
Hold on, I'll be right back.

751
01:14:48,135 --> 01:14:50,046
Where are you going?

752
01:14:50,095 --> 01:14:52,165
- The kid's inside. I gotta go get him.
- No!

753
01:14:52,215 --> 01:14:55,810
Aargh! Don't worry, I'll be back.
It'll just take a second.

754
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:57,732
No, he's the devil!

755
01:14:58,775 --> 01:15:00,652
Angie, it's gonna be OK.

756
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:02,094
No, it's not!

757
01:15:02,135 --> 01:15:05,127
No, we have to go! We have to go!

758
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:06,767

759

Let me out of here!

777
01:16:25,535 --> 01:16:27,014
(Gasping) Sam?

778
01:16:33,935 --> 01:16:35,368
Sam, look.

779
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:37,975
There plenty of food in here for you.

780
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,573
See?

781
01:16:39,615 --> 01:16:41,685
Sam, you don't have to eat me.

782
01:16:44,735 --> 01:16:46,327
Sam?

01:16:54,775 --> 01:16:56,766
(Gasps) Please, Sam. Stop.

787
01:16:56,815 --> 01:16:58,487
Hungry!

788

- (Growls)

792
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:40,088

799
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:25,051
(Man 1) How's she doin'?

800
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:26,813
(Man 2) She's lost a lot of blood.

801
01:19:27,855 --> 01:19:29,527
- And she's in a coma.
- Uh-huh.

802
01:19:29,575 --> 01:19:33,966
You know, I, uh,
I don't know when she'll come out of it.

803
01:19:34,015 --> 01:19:35,414
OK.

804
01:19:35,455 --> 01:19:37,366
But when she does, you let me know.

805
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:43,603
Goddamn slaughterhouse out there.
We need some answers.

806
01:19:43,655 --> 01:19:46,294
Doctor, look, she's awake.

807
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:53,773
Angie... Can you blink for me?

808
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:56,489
Good.

809
01:19:56,535 --> 01:19:58,765
Can you see better now?

810
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,330
Angie?

811
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,969
No! No! No!

812
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:08,327
Angie, it's OK. It's OK, you're safe.
Nurse! Nurse!

813
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:10,764
You're safe. You're safe.

814
01:20:10,815 --> 01:20:11,884
Rick?

815
01:20:11,935 --> 01:20:13,084
Yeah.

816
01:20:13,135 --> 01:20:16,571
Oh, God, Rick.
Oh, please don't leave me.

817
01:20:16,615 --> 01:20:18,890
No, I'm not going anywhere.

818
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:24,130
Angie, I'm gonna
have to ask you a couple questions.

819
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:25,847
Can't you give her a little time?

820
01:20:25,895 --> 01:20:27,647
No, son, I'm sorry, I can't.

821
01:20:27,695 --> 01:20:31,005
Now, Angie, your friend here said
you were babysitting. Is that correct?

822
01:20:31,055 --> 01:20:33,171
Yes.

823
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:35,445
Can you remember
what happened to the child?

824
01:20:35,495 --> 01:20:37,053
What do you mean?

825
01:20:37,095 --> 01:20:38,574
We couldn't find him.

826
01:20:38,615 --> 01:20:39,650
What?

827
01:20:39,695 --> 01:20:41,970
We found Chief Dinneli,

828
01:20:42,015 --> 01:20:43,414
the parents,

829
01:20:43,455 --> 01:20:46,253
and 20 female bodies
buried in the backyard.

830
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:47,933
None of them were children.

831
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:51,251
But he was in the barn.
He was in the barn!

832
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:54,292
Angie, try and remember exactly...

833
01:20:54,335 --> 01:20:56,291
- Let her be.
...where you last saw him.

834
01:20:56,335 --> 01:20:58,690
- Miss, can I help you?
- I'm her mother.

835
01:20:58,735 --> 01:21:02,171
- Mom!
- It's OK, baby. I'm here now.

836
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:10,091
- I'll be outside if you need anything, OK, Angie?
- No, Rick, stay. Please, stay.

837
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:15,126
We need to pray.

838
01:22:14,335 --> 01:22:16,690
