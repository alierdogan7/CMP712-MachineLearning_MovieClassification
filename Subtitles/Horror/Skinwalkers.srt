00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:39,070
Yee nadlooshi - The Navajo
term for 'Skinwalker'

2
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,384
Human beings, who, through
the blood of other humans...

3
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:42,751
have gained supernatural powers.

4
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:44,863
Some call it a gift - others a curse.

5
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:47,946
A war has begun - between those who
mean to end the curse,

6
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,661
and those who do not want
to lose their beastly powers.

7
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:53,277
According to the indian legend,
the end of all Skinwalkers...

8
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:57,032
will be brought about by a 13 year old boy.

9
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,376
There are some things in this world
so frightening...

10
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,461
that we pretend
they don't exist...

11
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,384
the stuff of nightmares...

12
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:11,289
we tell ourselves...

13
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,301
there no such thing...

14
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:17,423
but the truth is
they are out there...

15
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:23,438
and closer then we fear...

16
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:24,232
Silver bullets

17
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:30,265
Nice touch

18
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,359
now caretaker...

19
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,202
it looks like your out of a job...

20
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,933
you and your people have
been defending...

21
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:45,277
these pathetic creatures
for a long time

22
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:51,352
but it will all be over soon enough

23
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:59,203
we'll attack each of these camps
and destroy them...

24
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:04,374
and this disgrace to our true nature
will be over forever

25
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,227
what was on the tape?

26
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:12,240
you'll never find the boy in time...

27
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,286
now...

28
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,402
it can't be...

29
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:19,392
it already began...

30
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:25,263
the legend is true...

31
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,378
where is the boy?

32
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:27,299
tell me...

33
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:33,328
not in this lifetime

34
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,276
hurry.

35
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,262
gather your men

36
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,309
we have four days
to full moon

37
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,215
take this to Varek
he goes north...

38
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,380
tel him there's no time to lose

39
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,411
you find this boy or
it's the end of us

40
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,226
you can see for yourself...

41
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,256
the boy is safe...

42
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:57,291
but with the red moon

43
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,214
we should be ready for anything

44
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,200
just to make sure

45
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,280
you be careful

46
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,450
the red moon's power will be very strong

47
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,341
you will have to lock down
until this is over

48
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:15,230
I've gotta go, good luck and stay sharp

49
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,217
he's gonna make it

50
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,317
we all are

51
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,367
this isn't a dream anymore

52
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:27,209
four more days

53
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,239
well that's good news

54
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:34,255
the bad news is now y'all gotta
to spend the night downstairs

55
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:46,327
It's probably just a fuse
I'll be right back

56
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:48,423
Ralph

57
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:09,410
Ralph

58
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,930
Varek...

59
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,426
oh my God

60
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:35,303
Tell me when Varek
and the're all dead

61
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,398
so it's true

62
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:43,355
the boy's alive

63
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,207
where is he?

64
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,193
don't hurt him

65
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,424
that's not what I want...

66
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:50,288
if you co-operate with us,

67
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:53,478
then you will be spared
along with your husband

68
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,436
if you choose otherwise then you will be
forced to watch him suffer

69
00:08:57,536 --> 00:09:01,255
in agony allowing you one last look
at the life that you elected to end

70
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:07,268
do you understand?

71
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,481
good

72
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,368
now...

73
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:17,351
where is the child?

74
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:20,275
we don't know

75
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,322
we never have

76
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:22,408
she's fucking lying

77
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:23,458
they gotta know, Varek...

78
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:27,444
you think we hadn't thought
of something like this

79
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:31,269
of someone like you

80
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:34,301
do you think you're a martyr

81
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:40,334
you might as well be holding the blade

82
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:53,214
no...

83
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,461
no...

84
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,466
this everything is?

85
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,265
that's it

86
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,449
you believe her

87
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,286
it doesn't make any sense,
it is not possible Varek

88
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,402
it makes perfect sense...

89
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,223
they can't tell us what
they don't know...

90
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,323
no matter what we do to them

91
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:12,277
it's foolproof

92
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,325
the're dying for some kid
the've never even seen?

93
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:17,215
they have faith...

94
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,217
it's all they need

95
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,229
think of something

96
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:23,188
this kid is out there

97
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,336
I'd rather die then go back to that

98
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:26,436
we'll find the child

99
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,262
there's no alternative

100
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:37,291
we'll find him Sonya

101
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,238
You can't even see the kid's face...

102
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,321
so that's how they did it

103
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,340
boosted the morale 
without risking a thing

104
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,247
we're wasting our time Varek...

105
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,432
we only have four more nights
to find this kid

106
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:55,286
so

107
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:59,404
wait...

108
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:00,342
did you see that?

109
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,327
what?

110
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,195
right there

111
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:10,224
look at the mirror

112
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,501
Huguenun...

113
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,256
Come on baby breathe

114
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:24,271
please, just breathe

115
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:29,333
Will he can't breathe. I gave him a shot
this morning. I don't understand

116
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,324
The inhaler doesn't help
he just keeps getting worse and worse

117
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:36,357
Rachel, he's going to be OK

118
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,330
Tim...

119
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,183
I want you to breathe deep
and don't move...

120
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:48,195
Come on sweeetie

121
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,298
what is it?

122
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:04,256
it smells like crap

123
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,431
hey baby

124
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,531
are you OK?

125
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:36,510
do you want to see something freaky?

126
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:45,286
isn't that awesome?

127
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,186
did you have another bad dream?

128
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:58,199
no, I'm fine

129
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,246
come here you

130
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:06,184
let's snuggle

131
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:07,186
I love you mom

132
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:13,214
I love you too baby...

133
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,257
is everything all right?

134
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,244
I was worried when you weren't
there this morning

135
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,469
Tim had another attack
a bad one

136
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,196
he's all right now he's sleeping
so's Rachel

137
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:56,382
She was up most of the night

138
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,350
the moon...

139
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,403
is getting very powerful

140
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,503
this may get worse

141
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,193
Thank God for you Will
you've always been there for us

142
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,309
I don't know what we'd do without you

143
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:14,341
It's all in a days work

144
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:26,309
Tim looks well

145
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,285
yeah,he get's sick and he get's better

146
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,236
it's his whole life...

147
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:34,420
He comforts me

148
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,325
Jonas

149
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:39,457
What's wrong Rachel?

150
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:43,415
there's something I have to tell you

151
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,462
it's time for me and Tim to leave

152
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:48,386
we have to

153
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:51,402
I have to learn to be a mother
a good mother...

154
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:54,394
figure out what I want to do
with the rest of my life

155
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,329
you guys have raised him, I haven't

156
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,478
I'm so God damned dependent
on everyone here

157
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:03,300
I have to learn to stand
on my own two feet

158
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,284
he's been dead over
thirteen years now Jonas...

159
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,470
what progress have I made?

160
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,205
his ghost is all around me

161
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:12,177
every time I look at you...

162
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,411
Nana, Katherine...

163
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:16,460
I still see him

164
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,366
Come on  Rachel, don't fool yourself
 

165
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:22,416
my brother's ghost is going to be with you
whereever you go

166
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:24,221
you need to be strong...

167
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,805
despite that

168
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,339
he's want you to

169
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,426
I'm sorry Jonas

170
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:35,384
I've already made my decision

171
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:39,366
Hey Doak

172
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:43,420
ok...

173
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:45,475
you know...

174
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,295
you gotta give them what they want

175
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,410
What's that

176
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,232
I don't know, let me
see what I've got in here

177
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,399
 a DVD...

178
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:58,452
Yes

179
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,258
good morning
- good morning...

180
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,290
what are you doing here?
did you bring something?

181
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,266
Nothing
- the mail...

182
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,397
you forgot your name tag

183
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:12,354
oh shoot

184
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,304
thanks Nana

185
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:23,304
Pretty cool fool

186
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,298
This piece of track
it keeps catching

187
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,316
when did we start wielding blades?

188
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,369
A few days ago

189
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,326
mom gave it to me...

190
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,260
she was saving it for my birthday

191
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,197
I caught her trying to hide it
in her jewellery box...

192
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,395
so I got it early...

193
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:41,366
Nice

194
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,333
let me see that...

195
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:45,253
oh sure

196
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:48,240
it looks so used...

197
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,389
it's my dads

198
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:52,377
Hey

199
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,517
look what the cat dragged in

200
00:16:54,605 --> 00:17:00,507
Hey Adam

201
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,356
How you feeling big guy?

202
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,189
I'm hungry
Right, he said it

203
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:08,323
let's go get some breakfast

204
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:09,294
Easy

205
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,325
why does he have to do that?

206
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:13,214
Hey

207
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,480
I heard you had a bit of a scare last night...

208
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,249
how do you feel?

209
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,203
Huge! Check that out

210
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,215
Check this out

211
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:20,385
thanks Uncle Jonas

212
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:22,205
an early birthday present

213
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,287
wow dad

214
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,276
Is that a Smile?

215
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,196
Is Adam taking care of you?

216
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:31,312
come on

217
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,412
How about that wind last night

218
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,286
It was pretty wild huh?

219
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:36,401
shit

220
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,288
I'm late

221
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:38,419
Someone will drop Timmy at the store

222
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,451
we'll be there.

223
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,265
there's Courtney

224
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:07,449
Hey Adam, Rachel

225
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,338
How's Tim? All better?

226
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:12,822
He's fine, thanks.

227
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:17,319
Good News

228
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,267
Tim had an attack last night...

229
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,416
last night...

230
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:28,256
Can't even sneeze in this town without
anyone knowing our business

231
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,471
Ain't that weird?

232
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:35,502
I mean it's not not normal, it's not

233
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,403
we're not here right now

234
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:34,392
leave a message and we'll
get right back to you, thanks

235
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:37,193
Hey guys it's me

236
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:37,443
where are you?

237
00:21:37,543 --> 00:21:39,262
I thought you'd be here by now

238
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:41,362
It's geting late

239
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:46,288
Where are you?

240
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,469
Nana

241
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:51,392
Do you think the moon will
be red again tonight?

242
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,378
maybe...

243
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,313
Really? What makes it red?

244
00:21:55,413 --> 00:22:01,341
It's getting late, let's just get 
you to the store

245
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:19,393
Nana

246
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:45,319
Come on

247
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:04,404
All we want is the boy

248
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,343
run.

249
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:39,272
stay there...

250
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:51,258
I'll explain later. Right now
learn how to load a gun

251
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:52,426
Adam, what are you doing?

252
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:54,280
We need to move now

253
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,293
Timothy.

254
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:20,447
Get Down

255
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,461
Dad.

256
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,422
Head straight for the Saddle Shop

257
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,527
Stay there until I come for you

258
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:40,658
I'm not leaving you Nana

259
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,612
Do as I say

260
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:49,642
Go.

261
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:09,796
Get the boy.

262
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,837
Mom.

263
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:33,853
Are you OK?

264
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:02,849
don't move until I tell you...

265
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,412
We need

266
00:26:07,912 --> 00:26:13,782
To get to my garage

267
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:19,799
Trust me

268
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,827
Adam

269
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:38,179
They're on us

270
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:41,691
Where's Jonas?

271
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,136
Let's go let's move.

272
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:51,803
Give me your hand.

273
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,711
Give me your hand Rachel.

274
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:59,739
Come on.

275
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,848
Over there in the truck

276
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:21,663
Give me your hand

277
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:30,703
Go! Get out of here.

278
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:40,837
I can't believe

279
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:46,755
Get the bandages.

280
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,661
Let me see
Put some pressure here

281
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,736
Nana

282
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:11,789
How did they find us Jonas? How?

283
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,740
What the hell is happening?

284
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,642
They want Timothy...

285
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:16,655
What are you talking about?

286
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,662
They want to kill him, Rachel...

287
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:20,614
And they're not going to stop
until he's dead.

288
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:22,797
Why would anyone want to kill Tim?
He's just a boy.

289
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:27,772
In 3 days on a full moon,
something going to happen to Timothy.

290
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:33,800
Something they can't allow.

291
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,843
We'll find Him.

292
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:37,815
You know that.

293
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:40,599
You're not making any sense.

294
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,766
We're cursed

295
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,755
We kept you in the dark all these years

296
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,803
Because it was the best way to
prevent them from finding Timothy

297
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,691
Ever

298
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:52,708
and we kept him safe Rachel.
For thirteen years we kept him safe.

299
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:58,724
Don't

300
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,493
We call ourselves skinwalkers

301
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:08,593
I don't understand...

302
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,514
mumbles some crap

303
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:11,611
Who are they?

304
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:13,551
Skinwalkers.

305
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,600
But not like us.

306
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,557
It's really quite simple.

307
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,637
We want the curse to end

308
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:21,654
They don't

309
00:29:21,754 --> 00:29:23,560
Why do they want me?

310
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,564
Because you are the only
one that has the power...

311
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,664
To end the curse forever.

312
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:30,449
You're special Timothy...

313
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,602
You have your mother's blood,
and ours.

314
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:36,523
Nana was one of us.

315
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:37,492
So was your father.

316
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:39,606
No, it's impossible, not my husband...

317
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:41,528
Pull this thing over
We're getting out.

318
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:42,558
Rachel, please...

319
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:45,578
Don't you get it,
I don't believe you

320
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:52,512
It's going to be OK, I promise.

321
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,670
don't worry, she's safe

322
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,559
the're locked down

323
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:49,626
she needs to see it to believe it

324
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,514
You don't like me

325
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:52,578
I'm just a friend

326
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:56,599
I knew your father when he was your age
and Jonas and I go way back

327
00:30:56,699 --> 00:31:00,541
My people have been taking care of
these people for a long time

328
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,556
there's a legend, a belief

329
00:31:03,656 --> 00:31:04,562
that if a child....

330
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,662
a halfbreed....

331
00:31:06,753 --> 00:31:08,599
something like that...

332
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:12,401
and if he lives to be 13 years old
there's gunna be a red moon...

333
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:14,518
which is a signal to all skinwalkers...

334
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:20,568
that the prophecy will be fulfilled at
midnight on the day of your 13th birthday

335
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,628
When they turn the craving for
human blood is so intense

336
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:29,519
that if they break free and feed
they will become the beasts for ever

337
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,438
and the ones trying to kill me

338
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:32,603
they don't want the curse to end?

339
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:35,442
To them it's not a curse

340
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,321
the lust and desire to consume
human blood

341
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:38,396
is so overwhelming to them

342
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,424
it's like drugs to an addict

343
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,237
The first Skinwalkers were
Native American

344
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,373
they believed that the power of the wolf
was a gift

345
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:56,094
but it mutated and ....

346
00:31:56,194 --> 00:32:01,114
many couldn't control the lust for power
couldn't fight the beast inside them

347
00:32:01,214 --> 00:32:04,370
what makes you think I can?

348
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,256
if I live through this...

349
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:10,289
what is it that I'm supposed
to be able to do, exactly

350
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:13,322
I don't know

351
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:35,569
don't do this...

352
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,258
Here you go little girl

353
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:53,264
thanks Alan...

354
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,292
Anytime...

355
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,105
keep dreaming

356
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:08,057
Are we going to play some pool?

357
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:08,845
let's play Baby...

358
00:34:08,945 --> 00:34:09,858
Oh yeah, we're gunna play allright

359
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,062
Get your hands off me

360
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:14,918
we're two against one...

361
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,067
Get off of me!

362
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:22,027
Get off of me!

363
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,073
Hey sweetheart...

364
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:29,089
do you want some this?

365
00:36:56,114 --> 00:37:02,075
Please forgive us.

366
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,012
we're refueled...

367
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:12,795
I'm gunna head for the Stronghold

368
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:18,825
allright.

369
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,104
hey hey hey hey...

370
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:58,976
you know you might even like it
if you try it

371
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:05,004
not in this lifetime...

372
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,074
Where the hell are we gunna go?

373
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:22,033
we follow the leader...

374
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,833
let's go.

375
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:24,847
yeah...

376
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:30,864
let's get it done

377
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:53,677
I'm the same man Rachel...

378
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:55,500
no...

379
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,051
you're not, not to me

380
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:01,837
you've been living like this
your whole life?

381
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:03,937
every month?

382
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:04,892
what about them?

383
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:07,845
the ones coming after us
when they change do they...

384
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,045
they hunt and they kill
they're addicted to blood...

385
00:39:11,145 --> 00:39:13,079
once you feed you can't go back...

386
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:18,005
those beasts killed my husband
and now they're after my son...

387
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,789
how is a 13 year old boy
going to end all of this?

388
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:24,807
he's special...

389
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:27,117
the nightmares, the asthma

390
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:30,799
Timothy's body is at war with itself...

391
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:31,999
and he needs you...

392
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,099
we need you...

393
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:37,857
so what now?

394
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:39,973
How do we keep my son safe...

395
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:42,829
Now we keep together...

396
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:43,977
and we stay out of sight...

397
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:46,883
there's just two days...

398
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:51,969
we are so close, Rachel...

399
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:56,056
what is it baby?

400
00:39:56,156 --> 00:40:02,088
I don't feel so good...

401
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,849
ok baby

402
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:09,002
I'm here...

403
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,807
it's gunna be OK Timmy

404
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:12,889
What happened?

405
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:14,989
you passed out...

406
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,907
you'll be back in the game
in no time

407
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,919
somebody get the nurse...

408
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,809
Why don't you do a walk around?

409
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:30,058
I don't know this place...

410
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:35,078
I don't want any surprises...

411
00:40:35,178 --> 00:40:38,834
what is going on upstairs?

412
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:39,916
damn it

413
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,824
do you think he's gunna make it?

414
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:46,040
he always does

415
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,929
He's stronger then all of us
put together

416
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,882
yeah, I know that

417
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,031
and I believe that

418
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:56,870
just...

419
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,986
I'm sick of looking
over my shoulder...

420
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:00,942
and not knowing who to trust...

421
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:01,988
hello...

422
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:03,792
how do you feel young man?

423
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:04,908
Better

424
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:05,829
now that you're here

425
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:06,876
Tim...

426
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:07,893
it's fine...
cute

427
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,799
cute huh?

428
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,831
you had all the lab technicians
scratching their heads

429
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:13,401
let me guess...

430
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:14,918
I'm a werewolf...

431
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:17,018
not quite...

432
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:19,575
but he does have a vary rare blood type...

433
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:21,675
not only that but his white blood count
was off the chart

434
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:24,132
he gets that from me...
I'm AB negative

435
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,866
that's not it
What about his father?

436
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,852
That's a tough one

437
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:31,951
We're not sure...

438
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,051
ok...

439
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,985
You have some pretty strong blood
running through you

440
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,379
Adam...

441
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:45,234
we are so close...

442
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,383
before we know it

443
00:41:46,483 --> 00:41:51,370
our live are going to be our own
we can be whatever we want to be

444
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,276
ok...

445
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:56,426
we're so close

446
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:57,460
wanna be a better half

447
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,365
it's long hours...

448
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:02,352
yeah, it's a pay...

449
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:08,380
it's more about the benefits...

450
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:20,182
how long before we can be on our way?

451
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:21,402
let me go talk to the doctor...

452
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:24,324
don't be a stranger...

453
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:28,278
thank you

454
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:29,279

455
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:35,307

456
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,482

457
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:51,452

458
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:52,447
get to the roof...

459
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,438
you might see something we can't

460
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,305
Kath, you take the back entrance

461
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:57,386

462
00:42:57,486 --> 00:43:00,276

463
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:02,246
I want to get out of here...

464
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,427
we need to leave

465
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:05,399
I know...

466
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,479
Doak's gone to find someone...

467
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:09,202
he'll be a minute...

468
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:15,216
Car accident, head trauma

469
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:55,757
take a look.

470
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,270
Jonas...

471
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:23,282

472
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,204

473
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,238

474
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:41,458
we'd like to leave...

475
00:44:41,558 --> 00:44:44,473
Hey, what are you doing?

476
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,353

477
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,218

488
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:07,219

489
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:13,264
Rachel...

490
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:24,230
it's OK...

491
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:29,450

Jonas...

496
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:52,275
let's stop all of this.

497
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:56,229
Brother

498
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,482
cover me well

499
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:06,512
let her go Caleb...

500
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:16,255
Caleb

501
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,879
don't make me make something
I don't want to do...

502
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:35,184
join me...

503
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:37,350
we're one and the same

504
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,322
I'm nothing like you

505
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:42,241
I am what I was meant to be

506
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:45,324
you live a lie

507
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:47,314
you were wrong

508
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:51,268
I know what your feeling trust me

509
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:55,435
Trust you?

510
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:57,390
you're killing...

511
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,376
fellow human beings

512
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:02,228
I am not human...

513
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:08,185
and I will not risk spending
the rest of my days as one...

514
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,420
diseased and flawed...

515
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,424
you are better than this...

516
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:18,378
let her go Caleb...

517
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,262
let her go...

518
00:48:20,362 --> 00:48:22,445
we'll make you a deal

519
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:26,200
Katherine for the boy...

520
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,231
my daughter for your son...

521
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,279
what?

522
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:43,308
What the hell is he talking about Varek?

523
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:16,200
you told me that he was dead
Uncle Jonas...

524
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,385
you all told me that

525
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:20,357
you all lied to me

526
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,404
I believed that he was dead...

527
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:23,421
no...

528
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,209
mom.

529
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:27,309
they got her

530
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:33,325
Oh my god Jonas they got Kath

531
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:56,315
they wanted him killed

532
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:08,283
I thought he was dead...

533
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:13,192
well you were wrong

534
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:18,209
and now he's trying to kill my son...

535
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:24,242
his son...

536
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:30,349
we have to keep moving

537
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,891
That bitch was your wife...

538
00:50:48,491 --> 00:50:49,424
it was another life...

539
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:51,381
and that was your son?

540
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,334
I didn't know...

541
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:56,201
it changes nothing

542
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:57,417
it changes everything...

543
00:50:57,517 --> 00:50:59,451
that kid has to die

544
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:02,460
Sonya's right Varek this is fucked up
that boy has to die

545
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,376
I know 

546
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:06,391
I don't care who's kid it is

547
00:51:06,491 --> 00:51:08,263
you can't hesitate

548
00:51:08,363 --> 00:51:09,378
you shut your mouth

549
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:12,234
are you questioning my resolve.

550
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:15,317
the boy has no father...

551
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:21,333
and I have no son

552
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,445
Jonas

553
00:51:42,545 --> 00:51:44,367
 this is our best chance Adam...

554
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:47,354
we know this place is safe...

555
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:49,255
we'll be able to wait it out here

556
00:51:49,355 --> 00:51:50,189
we'll protect him here

557
00:51:50,289 --> 00:51:55,173
tell me she isn't worth it...

558
00:51:55,273 --> 00:52:01,206
tell me she isn't worth 
going back for

559
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,368
why are you doing this?

560
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:08,274
that son of a bitch is

561
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:10,457
he knows he's got my only weakness...

562
00:52:10,557 --> 00:52:13,244
that's why she's still alive Adam...

563
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:19,257
that's why we can't go back,
because that's what he's counting on

564
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:25,190
they're going to torture her mercilessly

565
00:52:26,523 --> 00:52:29,458
and you know she won't break

566
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:35,474
can you live with that?

567
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,368
neither can I

568
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:42,224
it's just one more day Adam
and all this will be over

569
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:43,389
everything that we believe in...

570
00:52:43,489 --> 00:52:45,361
lives in Timothy...

571
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,279
everything I believe in is out there

572
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:48,360
She's gone Adam

573
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,430
and if you go back it will be the end of us

574
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,185
Jonas...

575
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:56,268
it's as safe as we're gonna ger

576
00:52:56,368 --> 00:52:57,453
It's time for lockdown

577
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,472
all right

578
00:53:00,572 --> 00:53:02,429
Adam, you first

579
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:03,413
let's go...

580
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:09,441
the red moon is gonna be even stronger tonight

581
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:23,309
Adam

582
00:54:23,409 --> 00:54:27,292
Adam, I want you to find some higher
 ground and keep your eyes peeled

583
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:36,363
Adam

584
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:46,476
Adam...

585
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,409
get Timothy, we're leaving now...

586
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:36,427
we're no longer safe here

587
00:55:36,527 --> 00:55:42,270
how did he become one of them?

588
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,419
the night of the attack

589
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,342
we thought he was dead...

590
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,260
but we were wrong

591
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,460
now he must have survived 
and he must have hunted

592
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,475
Jonas it's Caleb.

593
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:53,314
 my husband...

594
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:54,301
your brother...

595
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:57,288
the Caleb you loved
died that night...

596
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,188
he is not dead...

597
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:01,421
how could you lie to me all these years?

598
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:03,342
I did it to protect you

599
00:56:03,442 --> 00:56:05,244
and he's taken Katherine...

600
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:07,230
you don't think that I feel
any of that...

601
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,312
do you?

602
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:12,381
I'm not like you Jonas

603
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:16,434
any of you remember

604
00:56:16,534 --> 00:56:19,291
I don't have the beast inside of me

605
00:56:19,391 --> 00:56:22,228
you better find it for your son...

606
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:24,213
or he will die?

607
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:27,262
Jonas...

608
00:56:27,362 --> 00:56:33,278
he found her

609
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,032
I told you not to go

610
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:49,439
you led them to us

611
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:55,467
I didn't see anyone

612
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,333
everybody in the truck...

613
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:07,345
we gotta go now

614
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,292
Tim...

615
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:17,255
are you OK baby?

616
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,416
I can't believe that it was him Daddy

617
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:28,175
he looked so different...

618
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:34,178
he wanted to know to where we were headed

619
00:57:34,278 --> 00:57:36,348
the others

620
00:57:36,448 --> 00:57:39,367
wanted me dead

621
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:40,418
he wouldn't allow it

622
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:46,451
I guess he saved my life

623
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,250
He's going to be on our tail now

624
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,433
we'll make up some time tonight

625
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:55,388
I'm sorry Jonas

626
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:56,356
I couldn't leave her

627
00:57:56,456 --> 00:58:02,356
Yeh I know

628
00:58:02,456 --> 00:58:08,406
I love you

629
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,669
I was zoning in and out

630
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:34,377
they wanted to know to where we were headed...

631
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,346
that's OK sweetheart

632
00:58:37,446 --> 00:58:39,332
we'll talk about it in the morning

633
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,216
I'll finish with Kath...

634
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:43,316
you two get yourselves locked up

635
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,253
she's going to need some time

636
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:45,220
I'm sorry

637
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,337
I just don't remember

638
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:50,326
it's all right

639
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,457
I wish I had more for you

640
00:58:51,557 --> 00:58:56,281
It's OK

641
00:58:56,381 --> 00:58:57,199
Jonas

642
00:58:57,299 --> 00:59:00,282
we  gotta get lockdown

643
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:01,316
you're gonna be OK Katherine

644
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,416
try and relax

645
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:09,434
we're gonna take this one step at a time

646
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:26,618
I got it

647
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,378
Daddy, sometings wrong with me

648
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:31,463
Kath what is it?

649
00:59:31,563 --> 00:59:34,251
get the fuck back cocksucker

650
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:36,335
lock her down

651
00:59:36,435 --> 00:59:38,307
just leave me alone

652
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:40,225
I don't know what's happening

653
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:41,390
I can't control it...

654
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:45,426
it's impossible, they left her for dead

655
00:59:45,526 --> 00:59:49,250
they made her feed do it now
lock her down

656
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:55,280
they gave me life...

657
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:04,222
what happened?

658
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,398
Adam, she'll kill us and she'll kill Timothy...

659
01:00:07,498 --> 01:00:09,287
it's what Varek wanted

660
01:00:09,387 --> 01:00:11,387
baby...

661
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:15,193

662
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:16,308
god it's so amazing

663
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,408
we can feel it together...

664
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:20,266
she's gone Adam, she's turned

665
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,347

666
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:25,433
you can't do it you fucking coward

667
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:27,390
Katherine don't make me do this.

668
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,418

669
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:42,493

675
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:19,263

686
01:02:07,339 --> 01:02:11,340
Timothy, open the door kiddo

687
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,260

688
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,194
Timothy stay down

689
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:18,417
keep the door closed

690
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:20,403
Timothy...

691
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,372

692
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,417

693
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:25,358
keep the door closed

694
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:30,211
shut the fuck up

695
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:33,311

696
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:36,330

697
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,349

699
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:45,192

700
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:46,392

701
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:49,348

706
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,205
Uncle Jonas is trying to hurt me...

707
01:02:58,305 --> 01:02:59,371

708
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:04,195

711
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:24,322
I'll miss you Daddy...

712
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:34,332
oh my God...

713
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:44,408

714
01:03:55,298 --> 01:04:01,259

716
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:58,422
we only have to make it to midnight...

717
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:01,412
three bodies but there's no kid

718
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:07,201
there's nothing back there
they're all gone

719
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:11,320
they're close...

720
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,225

721
01:05:13,325 --> 01:05:14,457
we're safe in here

722
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:18,194
that's a steel door, locks from the inside...

723
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:19,209
what are you thinking?

724
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:23,231
while I'm not there.

725
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:24,282
you want to go out there alone?

726
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:26,435
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve

727
01:05:26,535 --> 01:05:28,535
let me help you Jonas..

728
01:05:28,586 --> 01:05:30,190
now you listen to me...

729
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,273
after I turn I'm gonna be fighting
the need to feed

730
01:05:32,373 --> 01:05:33,273
we're here, we can help you...

731
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:38,200
on anything or anyone.

732
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,315
now I don't know what's gonna happen...

733
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:43,401
but if I feed I might lose control

734
01:05:43,501 --> 01:05:47,191
and you're not going to have a choice...

735
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:50,179
kill me.

736
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,309
you've gotta kill me...

737
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:52,393
swear it to me...

738
01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:55,233
swear it to me Rachel

739
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:59,283
you have no choice...

740
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:16,360

753
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:37,334
mom, Uncle Jonas is in trouble...

754
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,277
Uncle Jonas..

755
01:13:54,377 --> 01:14:00,290
No

756
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:16,040
UNcle Jonas

757
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:14,231
let's get the hell out of here.

758
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:21,238
no...

759
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:35,445
are you OK?

760
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:19,343
Dad...

761
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:36,260
can I help you?

762
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:42,272
we'd like a room

763
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,451
I need your names...

764
01:18:44,502 --> 01:18:46,236
and a credit card...

765
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:47,385
it'll be cash...

766
01:18:47,485 --> 01:18:53,417
cash works..

767
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,210
sorry, my wife's a little jumpy...

768
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,310
yeah, it's all right

769
01:19:12,401 --> 01:19:18,308
it's just one of those nights...

770
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,348
so many people sacrificed their lives for me...

771
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:41,364
and now I make sure
they did't die in vain...

772
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:48,215
Uncle Johannes was right after all

773
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:54,200
I do have the power to end the curse

774
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:59,290
it's not going to be as easy as they all hoped..

775
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:05,322
the power was in my blood

776
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:21,295
I am wounded

777
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:27,310
I'm here to be cured...

778
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,473
for some

779
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:33,445
I am salvation...

780
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:36,262
for the others

781
01:20:36,362 --> 01:20:42,292
their destruction

782
01:20:56,481 --> 01:21:01,481
