1
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,253
He went out to play.

2
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,410
And never came back.

3
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,130
Has he ever run away before?
-No.

4
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:27,655
Help!

5
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,253
No!

6
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,726
Stop!

7
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:46,248
COLD PREY

8
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:53,372
One out of four Norwegians
spends Easter in the mountains.

9
00:04:55,096 --> 00:05:00,966
Four searches are underway.
A total of eight people are missing.

10
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:11,088
A family of four has been reported
missing since last night.

11
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:23,208
Bad weather has hampered the
search.

12
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:27,810
Two men are missing in the
mountains.

13
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:32,256
Four skiers are feared dead...

14
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:40,253
The two 31-year-olds never returned
from their climbing expedition.

15
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:46,691
Red Cross and Norwegian People's
Aid are assisting in the search.

16
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:51,766
The two were expected back
yesterday afternoon.

17
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:55,811
50 people have been searching
in difficult conditions.

18
00:05:55,938 --> 00:06:00,056
110 skiers
have been reported missing...

19
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,932
The search for the missing person
began this morning.

20
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,088
How long have you two been dating?

21
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,615
I don't know about dating.

22
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,256
But we are into each other.
-Into each other?

23
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,209
Jerk!

24
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,377
Another lovely day on the slopes!
The sun is out -

25
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,733
and skiers are pouring in,
so be prepared for long queues.

26
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,814
Not where we're going!
-No, that must be miserable.

27
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,968
To get towed up a hill,
ski down, and go for a beer.

28
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,092
Eirik likes to stretch the limits.

29
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,736
Constantly searching
for the ultimate rush.

30
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,772
Living life on the edge!

31
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,175
This will be great.
-I'm not complaining.

32
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,895
Wait till you're there.
You'll see.

33
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,808
Won't it be great, Mikal?
-Awesome.

34
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,171
Exactly.
Awesome.

35
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,176
Shut up!

36
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,500
Are you moving in together soon?
-Maybe.

37
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:21,851
No, we...

38
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:42,090
How about you, Morten Tobias?
Are you getting anything?

39
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:48,217
Loads! This girl here and I
have sworn to be forever true.

40
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:53,013
Honestly.
We have sex many times a day.

41
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:57,333
I have sex with my closest friend.

42
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:30,260
What's special about that mountain?
-The backside is what's special.

43
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:34,414
Ready?
-Sure. Let's go.

44
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,501
Up by that overhang...

45
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:01,252
Wait, dammit!

46
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:08,337
Slowpoke!
-Shut up!

47
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:17,616
What's going on, Jannicke?
-What do you mean?

48
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,576
Fear of commitment?

49
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:24,219
No, that isn't it.

50
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,463
Eirik!

51
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:32,339
You go so well together.
-I know, but...

52
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:38,299
What if we start boring
the hell out of each other?

53
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:41,302
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

54
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:45,813
You should talk!
"Into each other"?

55
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:54,100
I can't just tell him
I'm head over heels.

56
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,658
Are you?
-Yes.

57
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,933
Yes, OK?
Yes, I am!

58
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:06,975
Are you coming?
-Huh?

59
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:10,097
Are you coming?
-Yeah, yeah.

60
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:16,973
Are we there yet?

61
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:37,620
Cool!

62
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:52,023
Nice!

63
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:14,463
Holy shit!
-Incredible!

64
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,024
Morten Tobias?

65
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:45,264
What happened?

66
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,823
What happened?

67
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,340
What is it?

68
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:06,779
I think he might have
broken something.

69
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,939
Shit!

70
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,629
Just lie down, Morten Tobias.

71
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,548
I have a shirt in there.
Tear it up.

72
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:25,662
It's OK.
It's just a small fracture.

73
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:32,545
We have to pull it into place.
Hold here.

74
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,498
Just relax.
Lie back down.

75
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:44,462
Come here.
Put your hand under there.

76
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,664
Careful!
-Sorry.

77
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,984
Easy now.
Lift it up.

78
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:53,579
Morten Tobias, keep breathing.

79
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,265
This might hurt a little.
On the count of three. OK?

80
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,506
Ready?

81
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,346
Ready?

82
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,588
One...

83
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,142
Any signal?
-Nope.

84
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,545
Nothing.

85
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,108
There's no signal here.

86
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,619
Now what do we do?

87
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,942
Should I try to go back to the car?

88
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:45,110
That would take too long.
He needs shelter now.

89
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:49,110
I could try
to get down to the village.

90
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,826
That would take just as long.

91
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:02,260
There are some buildings down here!

92
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,662
Are you all right?

93
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,669
Shit!

94
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,630
Hold him.
I'll go check.

95
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:31,664
Jannicke, toss me a pole!

96
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:33,988
Here!
-Thanks.

97
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:20,385
Hey!

98
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,630
Holy shit!
-Sorry.

99
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:37,349
Mikal, can you give us a hand?

100
00:18:56,715 --> 00:19:00,947
We need to set him down
and elevate his leg.

101
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,470
He can go in here.

102
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,634
Lay him on the table.

103
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:32,191
Careful!

104
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:38,508
We need to find a splint for his leg.

105
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,788
Ingunn, light a fire.
Mikal, find some alcohol.

106
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:47,592
Who made you boss?
-You have a better idea?

107
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:53,224
Try to relax.
I'll be right back.

108
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:41,394
Anyone find any painkillers?
-I forgot. Hang on.

109
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:49,507
Thanks.
-Christ!

110
00:20:57,278 --> 00:21:01,032
Is this good enough?
-Super.

111
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:12,229
Hey, pills and alcohol...

112
00:21:12,598 --> 00:21:15,988
...probably go great together.

113
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:28,111
Sorry.

114
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:48,870
Shit.

115
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,829
Christ!

116
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,993
What the hell is that?
Super glue?

117
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,397
It's all I could find.
But it works quite well.

118
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,755
Shit!

119
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,077
Breathe.

120
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,588
What do we do now?
-I don't know.

121
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,238
The car is too far away.

122
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:13,993
We'll wait until tomorrow.

123
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:18,592
Can we, with him?
-Yes. He's fine now.

124
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:22,631
You did well.

125
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:32,837
We'll stay here until tomorrow.
-Good idea.

126
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:38,037
Let's check this place out, then.
-Yes, come on!

127
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,557
I'll wait here.

128
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,956
Eirik?

129
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:49,480
Where is he going?
-Sightseeing.

130
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,832
An empty room...

131
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:46,313
Was there a fire here?
-Maybe someone just wanted an axe.

132
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:49,838
Hey, look at this.

133
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:06,515
Creepy.
-This is cool!

134
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:22,557
Are you looking for something, Eirik?

135
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:24,639
Yes.

136
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:26,755
This.

137
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:31,244
Hi.
-Don't do that.

138
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:35,554
Guess what?
I saw a vacant room.

139
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:41,037
Can you fire it up?
-We'll see.

140
00:25:41,284 --> 00:25:43,115
We're waiting.

141
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:52,201
The last time I got drunk on liquor
was my last year at school.

142
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:58,240
In Mr. Garholm's physics class,
to be exact.

143
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:03,074
Back then my heart was broken,
not my leg.

144
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:10,321
He asked me a question
about Uranus.

145
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:16,754
And I answered, "Hell if I know,
I've never seen your anus!"

146
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:24,284
And then I threw up
into my neighbour's pencil box.

147
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:26,965
Are you serious?
-No.

148
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:30,197
You just made that up?
-Yes.

149
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:32,043
You're an idiot!

150
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:49,075
I'll go check.

151
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:32,643
What was it?
-The door had blown open.

152
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:06,117
Son of a bitch!

153
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:11,604
Nice!
-That gave me a jump.

154
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,678
Son of a bitch...

155
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:24,077
Well done, Eirik!

156
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:27,687
Let's go look around!

157
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,597
Don't break more than necessary!

158
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:54,636
Mikal?
Ingunn?

159
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:01,758
No way!
-It's true.

160
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,005
My hero!

161
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:11,201
Aren't you
going to contribute, lazybones?

162
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:13,803
Yeah, yeah.
Shut up!

163
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,879
Lovely music you've selected.
-Me?

164
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:25,638
I'm not the DJ.
She put this on.

165
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:36,844
Smell that?
-It smells burnt.

166
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,719
I think it's from over here.

167
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:44,320
Look at that!

168
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,520
Cool.

169
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,929
The fire probably started right there.

170
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,366
Maybe he was smoking in bed.

171
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:30,965
He woke up in a panic.
The flames had spread around the room.

172
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,445
He couldn't make it to the door.

173
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,928
The window was stuck,
so he had to break it and...

174
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,611
And then...
Right, the axe!

175
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:50,202
Someone chopped the door down,
and put out the fire.

176
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:55,682
Maybe.

177
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:03,486
But when did this happen?
Why haven't they repaired it?

178
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,887
Mikal?
Stop it.

179
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:42,885
You jerk!
I'll get you for that!

180
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:48,608
A draught.

181
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:16,203
It's good we aren't somewhere
with ski lifts and cold beer.

182
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:21,164
What happened in the car...

183
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:27,089
About moving in together.
Don't worry about that.

184
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:30,205
I just...
-I'm serious.

185
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:44,688
We'd probably just
bore the hell out of each other.

186
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:19,487
Eirik, a Snow Daiquiri.

187
00:33:19,654 --> 00:33:23,647
Jannicke, darling,
Yellow Teaser or Pink Heaven?

188
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:26,891
I want Heaven.
-Yes, baby!

189
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:30,290
And we found this lovely treat.

190
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:36,284
A 35-year-old cognac.
The last dash goes to our patient.

191
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:40,931
Thank you, Mikal.
You are a splendid chap.

192
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:43,410
Mikal the Splendid!

193
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:49,931
There's nothing about a fire in here.

194
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:53,843
There's no mention of a fire
in this register.

195
00:33:57,655 --> 00:34:01,694
You don't write that
in a guest register.

196
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:04,807
"Thank you for a lovely stay."

197
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:10,885
"Just a pity that my bed caught fire
and burned my eyes out."

198
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:13,331
Damn tourists!

199
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:18,528
Wait, here's something :

200
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:23,683
"Don't give up hope.
We know you'll find your boy."

201
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:27,853
Did someone disappear?

202
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:30,695
That's the last entry.

203
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,328
That's it.

204
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:45,055
No one has written in this since '75.

205
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,885
The idyllic '70s.

206
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:05,574
Is that a picture?
Let me see.

207
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:09,408
No.
-Come on. Let me see!

208
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:13,095
Give me the damn picture!

209
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:15,811
Give it to me, Eirik!

210
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:18,248
Nice catch!

211
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:22,416
Right, the idyllic '70s.
-Let me see.

212
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:26,487
Idyllic?
This boy is ugly as sin.

213
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:31,531
So are you, Mikal.
-No, he isn't!

214
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:38,008
Mind my leg!
-All right.

215
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:43,687
But he isn't ugly.
-No, Mikal is a handsome lad.

216
00:35:44,697 --> 00:35:47,336
What was that ruckus you made?

217
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:51,211
We didn't make a ruckus.
-In the cellar.

218
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:56,047
We are sweet, innocent children.
-Sweet?

219
00:35:58,298 --> 00:35:59,936
Christ!

220
00:36:16,178 --> 00:36:20,410
Good night.
-Good night, darling.

221
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:24,933
Good night, darling.
-Good night, Mikal!

222
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:29,370
Good night, Uncle Tobias.
-Uncle Tobias?

223
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:48,573
After you, madame.
-Oui oui, Monsieur Mikal.

224
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,698
It's a little cold in here.

225
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,129
I'll warm you up.

226
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:33,175
Let's wait with that.

227
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:47,213
Let's wait.
Wait till some other time, OK?

228
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:52,330
What's the matter?
Is it too cold?

229
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:56,938
That too.
But it's just...a little soon.

230
00:38:58,822 --> 00:39:01,894
OK, I thought...

231
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:20,899
Are you angry?
-No.

232
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:24,571
I'm confused.
I don't know what you want.

233
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:28,854
What I want?
I like you. You know that, right?

234
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,894
You're just playing with me.

235
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:35,496
Cock tease.

236
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:40,691
Maybe I'm trying
to find out who you are.

237
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:44,498
Something you've made very clear now!

238
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:38,260
I'm trying!
-Come on.

239
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:44,654
Holy shit...

240
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:50,417
Look.
-I don't want to look at your cock.

241
00:40:50,544 --> 00:40:55,334
Look, Jannicke.
-She doesn't want to look either.

242
00:40:55,464 --> 00:40:59,935
Just piss and shut up, OK?
-Look, Jannicke.

243
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:34,615
Hello?

244
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:44,656
Mikal?

245
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:33,618
Hello?
-Hi.

246
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:05,900
Can you take him?
-Sure.

247
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:18,745
Are you expecting someone,
or can I join you?

248
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:24,987
Why don't I get you a bucket...

249
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:27,669
You're a bucket...

250
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:37,544
Couldn't you sleep?

251
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:52,424
I don't know what she wants.

252
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:56,742
One minute she's ready, and then...

253
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:59,508
Suddenly she just...

254
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,790
Maybe she's nervous.

255
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:08,985
Why? It doesn't exactly seem
like I'm her first...

256
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,142
No?

257
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,748
You mean she hasn't...?

258
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,264
She's crazy about you.
I know it for a fact.

259
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,627
Idiot!

260
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,105
She's crazy about you.

261
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:32,900
It's just that sometimes we girls
need a little more time.

262
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,742
Ingunn?

263
00:46:31,432 --> 00:46:33,502
Ingunn?

264
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:42,344
I'm sorry about last night.
I was...

265
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:49,422
I've made you some breakfast.

266
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:56,749
Fine.

267
00:46:56,872 --> 00:46:59,784
I'll leave it out here.

268
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:19,905
Are you sure you should leave now?
-I have to go.

269
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:24,870
Yeah.

270
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:36,668
Hi. How did it go with Ingunn?
-I don't know.

271
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:39,944
She wasn't very talkative.

272
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:53,903
Hi.

273
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:57,067
Be careful.
-Don't worry.

274
00:47:57,193 --> 00:48:00,948
We'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.

275
00:48:01,074 --> 00:48:07,866
And then you and I are going to relax
in some hotel down in the valley.

276
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:11,149
Just relax?

277
00:48:11,634 --> 00:48:14,546
Morten Tobias is awake.

278
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:19,704
Good luck, Eirik.
-Thank you.

279
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:23,310
Hold that thought.
-You too.

280
00:48:24,634 --> 00:48:26,784
Bye.

281
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:33,188
Hi.
How are you feeling?

282
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:36,104
Super.

283
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,184
One more.

284
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:25,354
Is the taxi on its way?
-Eirik is out flagging one down.

285
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:28,228
Wake me up when he's back.

286
00:49:50,276 --> 00:49:54,986
Didn't she say anything?
-No. Didn't even open the door.

287
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:58,552
Maybe I should go talk to her.

288
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:04,394
The generator.
Come on.

289
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:21,395
Ingunn!

290
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:24,873
Ingunn!

291
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:52,307
Hello?

292
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,587
Hello!

293
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:22,108
Jannicke?

294
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:48,431
You helped fire it up.

295
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:53,595
Sure, but Eirik
was the one that fixed it.

296
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,793
He messed around with
something over here.

297
00:52:00,919 --> 00:52:03,672
We can add more fuel here.

298
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:07,309
Hello?

299
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,589
Hello?

300
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:21,676
Where is everyone?

301
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,909
There isn't much.

302
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,193
My God!

303
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:40,638
What is all this?
-It looks like a lost and found.

304
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,994
Check this out.
-Nice!

305
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:36,077
Has someone been living in here?

306
00:55:04,923 --> 00:55:08,996
Have you heard about
that cabin fellow?

307
00:55:09,123 --> 00:55:14,322
He breaks into cabins
and shits on the floor.

308
00:55:15,323 --> 00:55:18,599
Maybe it's someone like that.

309
00:55:33,924 --> 00:55:36,119
Mikal.

310
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:53,997
It's the family from that picture.

311
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:00,642
TRAGEDY STRIKES AGAIN

312
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:03,956
Look.

313
00:56:04,084 --> 00:56:06,473
HOTEL OF EVIL

314
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:20,798
If this place has been closed
for over 30 years...

315
00:56:22,485 --> 00:56:24,601
What about this?

316
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:29,953
And everything in those shelves.

317
00:56:31,565 --> 00:56:35,797
And all of this.
This isn't 30 years old.

318
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:49,004
Let's get out of here.

319
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:26,318
Son of a bitch...

320
00:57:38,966 --> 00:57:41,082
Hello?

321
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,243
Ingunn?

322
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:04,765
Darling?

323
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:09,844
Mikal has made breakfast for you.

324
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,199
Morten Tobias?

325
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:18,286
He desperately wants to talk to you.

326
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:24,517
It's all been a...

327
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:51,478
Morten?

328
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,204
Help me up!

329
00:59:10,168 --> 00:59:15,925
Christ, you scared me.
-I woke up. No friends to be seen.

330
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:22,678
No food.
I declared war on a tin can, and lost.

331
00:59:24,569 --> 00:59:26,685
Hi...

332
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:32,085
What's the matter?
-Ingunn.

333
00:59:33,649 --> 00:59:35,367
What is it?

334
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:02,285
What the hell?

335
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:08,366
We're alone here.
We're miles away from anyone.

336
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,162
What is it?

337
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,087
What is it?

338
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:20,488
We have to get out of here.

339
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,128
This way!

340
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,480
Wait!

341
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:37,447
Come on!

342
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,880
Hang on.

343
01:00:48,531 --> 01:00:52,683
What's going on?
-Someone lives in the cellar.

344
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:56,520
He's collected things.
-What kind of things?

345
01:00:56,651 --> 01:01:00,360
Not the kind of things
people leave behind.

346
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:03,051
What do we do now?
-Wait.

347
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:09,280
For what? For him to get us too?
-For Eirik to bring help!

348
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:56,407
Mikal, can you please sit still?

349
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,801
No one can hear this.
-I hear it.

350
01:02:08,332 --> 01:02:10,846
Mikal, please.
-Shut up!

351
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:14,848
He can see you!
-Sit down, idiot.

352
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:21,363
Where is Eirik?

353
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:26,731
We can't just sit here.

354
01:02:26,853 --> 01:02:29,925
What if Ingunn needs help?

355
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,369
Jesus Christ!
Idiot!

356
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:39,764
What did you say?
-She's been chopped to pieces!

357
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,562
What did you say?!

358
01:02:49,773 --> 01:02:51,923
Calm down!

359
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:57,044
OK?

360
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:03,167
I'm going to look for her.

361
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:09,812
Mikal, do you really
think she's alive?

362
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:19,250
It was my fault.
I should never have left her.

363
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:26,971
Wait.

364
01:04:51,456 --> 01:04:53,447
Ingunn?

365
01:04:59,936 --> 01:05:01,927
Ingunn?

366
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:11,493
Shit!

367
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:28,336
Can you hear anything?
-No.

368
01:06:31,258 --> 01:06:33,772
Open up!
Let me in!

369
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:36,216
Come on!

370
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:41,249
What's going on?

371
01:06:42,818 --> 01:06:45,571
Did you see anyone?

372
01:06:46,658 --> 01:06:48,729
This won't do.

373
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:55,811
Tell us what's going on!

374
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,093
What the fuck...?

375
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,170
What was that?

376
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:11,972
He could easily
have broken down that door.

377
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,491
We have to get out of here.
Find some skis, or...

378
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:21,812
What about my leg?

379
01:08:21,941 --> 01:08:25,854
We can get away, Jannicke.
He's doomed anyway.

380
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:28,893
There must be another way.
-What?

381
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:33,776
He's the size of a house,
with a huge pickaxe!

382
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:37,530
Jannicke...
-We can hide in another room.

383
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:42,257
Go ahead.
-If you leave, we don't stand a chance!

384
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:45,339
We don't stand a chance anyway.

385
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:47,932
Mikal!

386
01:08:57,901 --> 01:08:59,812
We'll be OK.

387
01:11:58,265 --> 01:12:00,221
Jannicke...

388
01:12:00,345 --> 01:12:02,984
I don't want to die!

389
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:07,545
You aren't going to die.

390
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:16,655
I'm going to leave you...
-No!

391
01:12:16,786 --> 01:12:19,300
I'll be right back!
-No!

392
01:12:21,866 --> 01:12:24,778
Morten, look at me.

393
01:12:24,906 --> 01:12:28,740
You'll be fine.
Everything will be OK.

394
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:32,344
Everything will be OK.

395
01:12:35,186 --> 01:12:40,818
Here. Read this.
Memorize the entire label. OK?

396
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:47,855
Jannicke.

397
01:12:49,867 --> 01:12:52,984
I have to tell you something.

398
01:12:54,947 --> 01:12:57,017
I...

399
01:13:02,627 --> 01:13:05,061
I know, Morten.

400
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:51,059
Son of a bitch!

401
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:04,298
That's good.

402
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,900
Shit!

403
01:16:40,952 --> 01:16:43,102
Morten, it's me!

404
01:16:47,272 --> 01:16:51,311
Is it loaded?
-Yes. And I found a sledge and skis.

405
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:54,549
Let's go!
-He'll just catch us.

406
01:16:54,672 --> 01:16:57,505
We have the shotgun!
-With one shell!

407
01:16:57,632 --> 01:17:02,148
What if we miss?
Have you fired a shotgun before?

408
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:05,025
I know what we have to do.

409
01:17:12,352 --> 01:17:16,231
We'll lure him down here,
and lock him in.

410
01:17:17,752 --> 01:17:22,269
Is there no other way out?
-I don't think so.

411
01:17:22,953 --> 01:17:24,830
Come on!

412
01:17:26,793 --> 01:17:28,988
Ready?

413
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,589
What are you doing?

414
01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:33,346
Flash if he comes back.

415
01:19:16,675 --> 01:19:18,984
Hi.
-Eirik!

416
01:19:19,115 --> 01:19:23,154
What's going on?
-We have to go!

417
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:27,832
Where am I?
-We have to get out of here!

418
01:19:28,315 --> 01:19:30,670
I found your keys.

419
01:19:30,795 --> 01:19:33,355
We have to go!

420
01:19:57,236 --> 01:20:01,309
We have to get out!
We have to go now!

421
01:20:02,876 --> 01:20:04,912
Lie perfectly still.

422
01:20:05,476 --> 01:20:07,512
Don't move.

423
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:16,710
Shoot him!

424
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:49,156
It worked.
It worked!

425
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:54,590
Come on! Let's go!
-Eirik's in there.

426
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,756
Eirik's in there.
-Eirik?

427
01:21:58,559 --> 01:22:02,313
I couldn't get him out.
-Eirik?

428
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:06,031
What the hell?
Why...?

429
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:12,154
OK...

430
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:14,708
What do we do now?

431
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:24,312
Jannicke, what do we do now?
-Lure the bastard out and shoot him.

432
01:22:25,839 --> 01:22:27,830
OK.

433
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:34,231
Give me the shotgun.
I'll shoot him.

434
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,757
OK?

435
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,751
I'll do it.

436
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:29,354
No!

437
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:38,353
Jannicke...

438
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:47,316
Jannicke!

439
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:49,791
Wait.

440
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:52,878
Don't move.

441
01:23:57,361 --> 01:24:00,910
Jannicke, get out of here.

442
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:02,838
Go, Jannicke.
Go.

443
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:08,557
Go.

444
01:24:10,162 --> 01:24:12,312
Go, Jannicke.

445
01:24:20,962 --> 01:24:24,477
You just stay right there, OK?

446
01:24:25,682 --> 01:24:28,480
Don't move.
I mean it.

447
01:24:31,642 --> 01:24:35,715
I'll blow your brains out!
Don't move!

448
01:24:43,482 --> 01:24:45,074
Fuck!

449
01:29:51,889 --> 01:29:53,561
No!

450
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:18,171
