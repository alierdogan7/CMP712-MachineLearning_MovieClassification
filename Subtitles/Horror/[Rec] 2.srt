1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,922
- Come on, life sounds. Let's go.
- Okay.

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,508
Mike down, mike down.
There you go, now go.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,593
You'd think I'd never
done this. Ready?

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,346
Hey, wait a second. Ready.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,431
Five, four, three...

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,475
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.

7
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,937
Come with us tonight
as we travel along with-

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,232
- Sorry.
- Okay.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,067
- Ready?
- Yeah, wait a second.

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,110
You got a little
hair thing. Hold on.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,363
Let me get that.

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,281
That right there.

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,368
- Okay, there we go.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,119
Okay.

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,541
Hold on.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
Okay. Ready.

17
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,129
Hi, I'm Angela Vidal.

18
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:50,634
Come with us tonight as we paint
the town red on The Night shift,

19
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,221
Sorry, a little off my A
- game. I'll get there.

20
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,850
That wasn't bad. The second part
just seemed a little pushed, though.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,186
On tonight's Night shift,
we're in Los Angeles...

22
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:05,357
...traveling along with that special
breed of hero we like to call...

23
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,861
...the fire department.

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,006
We should have come earlier.
We could be going with them.

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,552
Well, that's cool. You got it?

26
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,347
- Yeah, that's great. That was perfect.
- We'll wait for them to get back.

27
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,641
- You prefer Bob or
Robert-? - Bob's good.

28
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,727
- Bob, okay, sorry. Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,438
Three, two, one.

30
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,983
Tell us, Bob, what's a normal
night here at the station?

31
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,985
This might surprise
most people...

32
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,030
...but 85 percent of the
calls we go out on are medical.

33
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,241
It can be anything from chest
pain to more serious things.

34
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,328
How do you handle that with
ambulances and hospitals?

35
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,080
Most ambulances you
see are fire department.

36
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,166
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,002
And most firefighters
are also paramedics.

38
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,755
At least, that's the
direction it's going.

39
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,966
One more question, something
I'm sure we're all wondering:

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,012
Do firefighters still slide
down those fabulous poles?

41
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,014
We sure do.

42
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,516
No turning back.

43
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,352
Tell my mom I loved her.

44
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,856
- See?
- That's not so bad.

45
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,318
I'm glad I didn't wear a skirt.
That could really hurt your legs.

46
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:35,155
Tell me, Bob, how do you get
down when you're wearing a skirt?

47
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,491
Pantyhose help.

48
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,201
Pantyhose.

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,162
That's what they wear under
their, what, their turnouts.

50
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,497
- Exactly.
- Pantyhose.

51
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,292
- Fire- retardant pantyhose.
- You heard it here.

52
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,127
- Can I do it one more time?
- Sure.

53
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,963
I'll be right back, okay?

54
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,423
- We're going to the dining hall.
- All right.

55
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,885
- Couple of guys I want you to meet.
- Cool.

56
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,436
Hey.

57
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,232
- This is Jake.
- Hey.

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,525
- And Fletcher.
- Hi.

59
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,860
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,238
These are the men you'll be
shadowing. Wherever they go, you go.

61
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,533
Cool. Please, oh, please,
finish eating. We'll talk after.

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,410
- Well, would you like some?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,995
- Did you make
it? - We got-

64
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,621
I didn't make it.

65
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,331
Firemen are really good cooks.

66
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,250
- Yeah, that's what I hear.
- Exactly.

67
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,961
- You should try some of the food.
- Yeah, I'm game.

68
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,630
- Please finish eating.
- We'll get you a plate.

69
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,008
Great. Sounds great.

70
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,386
Just maybe un
- tuck your shirt and stick it up here.

71
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,139
- Okay. Okay.
- Clip it on your collar.

72
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,476
- You filming this?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,563
Elliot's been telling me I never give him enough B
- roll...

74
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,565
...so I'm just
gonna shoot it all.

75
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,318
- Jake? Jake?
- Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,237
If you could keep from
rubbing into the mike too much-

77
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,573
- Sorry, yeah.
- Don't worry about the camera.

78
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,491
- Pretend it's not even there.
- Okay.

79
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,911
Can you say something?
Give me a level?

80
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,038
Yeah. Mike check, one-

81
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,790
You can just pretend it's
not there. Just talk free.

82
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,502
Can you say something
more compelling?

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,463
I don't know what to say-

84
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,299
I mean, am I gonna have
this thing on all the time?

85
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,719
Yeah, just watch what you
say. We'll hear everything.

86
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,387
Shit.

87
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,474
You're probably not allowed
to swear on your station.

88
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,518
No. We can cut most of it out.

89
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,853
But it helps if you're not dropping F
- bombs.

90
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,814
Point noted. Filed right here.

91
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,068
So if I was to call this guy an ass
- monkey...

92
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,446
...that would be considered
a swear too, right?

93
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,783
It's gonna be a long night.

94
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,117
- So this thing?
- Yeah?

95
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,121
Is this some sort of torture device
when you don't get in your turnouts?

96
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,123
- That's what it is.
- Can you get it?

97
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,042
Yes. This is called
a hook ladder.

98
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,795
We use this in the- The
firemen would use this-

99
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,588
- We should bring it down?
- Yes.

100
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,923
- Okay.
- All right.

101
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,216
Can you grab the hook?

102
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,468
So this was used in
the '20s and the '30s.

103
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,846
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

104
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,681
And as you can see...

105
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,809
...these are the rungs,
and the hook at the end...

106
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:14,022
...they would grasp onto one
window and then pull themselves up.

107
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,193
And then when they got to that
windowsill, they would hook it again.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,112
- And then pull themselves up.
- Okay.

109
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,364
Did you get the hook,
Scott? You see this?

110
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,409
Used in the '20s and '30s.
They stopped using it around-

111
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,619
- Hold it up higher.
- Replaced it-

112
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,121
- That's good, right?
- Good.

113
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,623
Replaced it with a regular
ladder that extends?

114
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,333
Yeah, and rope.

115
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,087
They must have tiny feet.
Those are little rungs.

116
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,715
Yeah. Firemen were a
lot smaller back then.

117
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,885
The fires were bigger
and they were smaller.

118
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,182
- Don't tell captain we took this down.
- I'm not gonna tell him I touched it.

119
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,351
I wanna introduce you to
somebody. This is Wilshire. Mark.

120
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,769
- Good boy.
- Hey, Wilshire.

121
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,897
- Say hi.
- Dog right out of the cartoons.

122
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,150
Well, there's a reason why the
Dalmatians were in cartoons.

123
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,903
The fire department has a
great sense of tradition.

124
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,196
Yeah, we do.

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,239
Dalmatians got along
well with horses.

126
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,909
Important when the fire trucks were horse
- drawn.

127
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,577
Now they're used as mascots.

128
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,080
But what they're trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic.

129
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,249
- Kind of like Fletch.
- Yeah.

130
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,045
That's what I do, I run out there.
Sort of like what a siren does today.

131
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,341
Okay, well, Wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire.

132
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,092
- Stop, drop and roll.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,887
So let's just pretend you're
5 years old and on fire.

134
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,264
- I'm on fire.
- Wilshire's gonna teach you.

135
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,058
Tell me what to do.

136
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,310
Okay. Wilshire.

137
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,272
Wilshire, mark. Stay.

138
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,815
Wilshire, drop.

139
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,109
Drop. Drop.

140
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,362
Wilshire, roll.

141
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,655
Wilshire, roll.

142
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,240
- Good.
- Look at that.

143
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,867
Good boy. Good boy.

144
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,495
- I'm gonna live.
- Report.

145
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,497
You're not gonna be on fire.

146
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:57,626
So it's stop, drop and roll, in
case you catch on fire. Wilshire.

147
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,129
- Yeah, you know, have some fun.
- You all hang out a lot?

148
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,006
- Yeah.
- You kind of live together.

149
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,634
Yeah, we definitely live
together. Close quarters.

150
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,094
- Okay, good.
- Oh, ready?

151
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,055
So yeah, we have 48
- hour shifts...

152
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,683
...so we have everything
we need in this place...

153
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,103
...from, you know, a small
gym to this handball court.

154
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,230
I'll show it to you.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,943
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,739
sir, you got a call
on the office line,

157
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,033
Can you pick up a call
on the office line?

158
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,451
Non
- responder.

159
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,828
- Oh, shoot.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,830
- I was hoping we'd get a call.
- Yeah.

161
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,624
Not a big one, a little
call so we can see action.

162
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,042
- Exciting, I guess.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,545
Gotta be annoying when
trying to finish a game.

164
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,880
Not if you're losing.

165
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,507
Every time, you know, we
go respond to a call...

166
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,259
...the points reset.

167
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,053
Depending on which side
you're on, it's sort of nice.

168
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,222
Works in your favor
from time to time?

169
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,683
Not in my favor. What
are you talking about?

170
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,226
I never lose.

171
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,062
I think I'd roller
- skate if I had access to this.

172
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,691
I can see you
doing that. Yeah.

173
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,028
Okay, so this is where the men
store their boots and turnouts.

174
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,155
The pole hole is over here.

175
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,951
- The pole hole.
- Yeah, interesting name, I know.

176
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,953
- You got the locker room here.
- Yep.

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,330
You got the dorms here.

178
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,582
Our viewers always
like to see action...

179
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,043
...so maybe we should
go into the locker room.

180
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,462
- Let's go in the locker room.
- You got it.

181
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,466
- Right this way.
- I was kidding, I was kidding.

182
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,885
Okay, towel up, guys.
We got a female on deck.

183
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,888
- Female on the deck.
- Oh, my God.

184
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,140
That's Griffin. He
can't sing very well.

185
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,476
He's got one major
talent, so come this way.

186
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,187
- He's got a huge talent.
- We're not using this.

187
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,191
Here. We have different hoses at the
station, and this is the Griffin hose.

188
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,777
- Griffin hose.
- What the hell?

189
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,029
You know, I hope that's a wide
- angle lens.

190
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,948
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,282
Stay in there.

192
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,535
Hey, put that thing away.

193
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,829
This is adding a whole new
meaning to the term fireman's hose.

194
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,498
- Hey, hit the
floor. - Oh, my-

195
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,708
I understand why there
are no women here.

196
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,336
- Plenty of female firefighters.
- In this station?

197
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,838
No, not currently.

198
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,674
Okay, I think I can
be a firefighter.

199
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:12,135
- Yeah, it's a lot harder than it seems.
- Keep the door closed.

200
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,555
You know what? Pick
something you're good at.

201
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,850
I bet you $10 I can do it better.
You all can be my witnesses.

202
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,768
- That's too easy. Ten bucks?
- Yeah.

203
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,562
How about my place?

204
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,314
I think we're done here.
We got everything we need.

205
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,066
Here we go. Listen up.

206
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,318
Did you know you were
gonna be on camera?

207
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,362
- Behind the line. Ready?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,322
- Ten bucks.
- You can't be in the way.

209
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,116
- I know.
- Get on that side.

210
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,118
I'm just saying.
You guys ready?

211
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,036
- You know what you're doing?
- Yes.

212
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,621
And go.

213
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,458
- Get in there.
- That's not nice.

214
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,669
That's not fair. She pushed.

215
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,964
- She pushed.
- Haven't got that much time.

216
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,219
- Yes. You owe her 10 bucks, man.
- Ten dollars.

217
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,555
Pay up. Oh, that's
embarrassing.

218
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,683
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- That's really embarrassing.

219
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,394
Okay, rolling.

220
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,065
Just waiting on
something to happen.

221
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,486
You wanna go back outside?
See what they're up to?

222
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,238
Why not?

223
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,202
- Careful.
- Thank you.

224
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,665
We're good.

225
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,214
You good?

226
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,633
I think they're
talking about you.

227
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,343
Will you turn up his mike?

228
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,596
You didn't catch no eye.
Here, give me some of that.

229
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,516
I'll tell you, all right?

230
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,811
A hundred bucks says I can
bang her by the morning.

231
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,564
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take that bet.

232
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,066
You're so busted.

233
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,443
Nice mike.

234
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,784
Missed a spot.

235
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,121
- Sorry, what?
- I said you missed a spot.

236
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,417
Oh, I know how to hit the spot.
Don't you worry about that.

237
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:12,172
I'll hold your camera.
You go kick his ass, okay?

238
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,890
That's how you
do pick and roll.

239
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,642
Oh, yeah? Is that
how you do it?

240
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,186
He'll show you
how to do it later.

241
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,189
It's nighttime here...

242
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,693
...and the firefighters take
turns sleeping in these rooms here.

243
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,197
But if the alarm rings, they can be up
and on the truck in under one minute.

244
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,701
Let's check out the room.

245
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,954
Can you get in here?

246
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,876
It's like my college
dorm without the pink.

247
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:55,174
Attention, 222 Truck 16,

248
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,426
- Watch your back.
- Hey.

249
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,845
Looks like you got your call.

250
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,432
- Just try to keep up.
- You okay?

251
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,519
- We're going to the pole hole.
- Come on, come on.

252
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,980
- Got it?
- What you wanna do?

253
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,857
I can't slide down there.

254
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,276
Come here, come
here, come this way.

255
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,738
Careful, okay? We have
to get on that truck.

256
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,865
- There are like 15 stairs.
- I got it.

257
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,159
- You be careful.
- Keep going, keep going.

258
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,328
- It's this way?
- Yeah. Yeah, keep going.

259
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,246
- Be careful.
- Make a quick right.

260
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,749
Make a quick right, baby.

261
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,837
Just jump in the back.

262
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,013
- Jump in.
- Buckle up.

263
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,723
- We're almost in.
- You guys in?

264
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,100
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Yep?

265
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,020
Nice job.

266
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,780
What kind of call is this?

267
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,365
Probably just a medical.

268
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,742
- Okay.
- We'll find out when we get there.

269
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,078
You seem to have
kept shooting.

270
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,915
Ready?

271
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,835
Ready, set. Ready, set.

272
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,505
Okay, good.

273
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,926
Most little girls wanna be ballerinas
or princesses when they grow up.

274
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,680
I used to tell my mom, "Someday,
I'm gonna grow up and be a fireman. "

275
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,724
Tonight, I am truly
living the dream.

276
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,602
It's so loud, I don't
think we can use any of it.

277
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,564
Scott, I am still
living the dream.

278
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,653
Thirty
- seventeen, go ahead,

279
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,998
All right, we got a
eight at 3 o'clock.

280
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,168
Keep calling out numbers.
What are you doing?

281
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,919
Well, Jake's the engineer.

282
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,630
He's actually a third
- generation engineer...

283
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,008
...but I have the
most important job.

284
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,301
Navigating?

285
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,262
No, I'm in charge of
the chick- o- meter.

286
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,139
When I see a
girl, I rate them.

287
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,434
So if I say there's
a eight at 3 o'clock...

288
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,562
...the guys know they
better look to the right.

289
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,942
You know, it's really funny. I always
thought firemen were so dignified.

290
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,778
Oh, no, no. I signed up
for brave and courageous.

291
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:26,283
- I don't do dignified.
- Yeah, I think we get that by now.

292
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,871
I see a nine at 2.

293
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,457
- Oh, we got a nine at 2.
- Yeah.

294
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,752
Whoa, that's a dude.

295
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,757
It's called a chick- o-
meter, not a dick- o- meter.

296
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,218
I think we're good.

297
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,596
You're fired. You
can't talk anymore.

298
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,812
So where do you
think the problem is?

299
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,899
Do you think it's over
there, around the corner?

300
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,526
Or maybe around there?

301
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,152
You're rotten, you know that?

302
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,447
To the core,
baby. To the core.

303
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,253
What are you taking with you?

304
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,129
Tools.

305
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:25,551
Really anything we might need
to break a lock or open a door.

306
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,136
- You're the one who called this in?
- Yeah.

307
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,471
Come, follow me.

308
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,348
Look at Probie's new turnouts.

309
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,892
I didn't know they
made them that new.

310
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,937
We're almost to the building.

311
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,857
Police are here. Might be
more serious than we thought.

312
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,692
Probably not.

313
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,955
A woman was screaming
bloody murder up there.

314
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:57,499
- It's Mrs. Espinoza.
- Two cops are up there.

315
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,835
- When did they get here?
- Five minutes ago.

316
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,379
- What's that sound?
- Sound of the building.

317
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,714
It's very old.

318
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,675
- He insists on fixing everything.
- Wanda, please.

319
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,719
- What apartment number?
- It's up here.

320
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,346
- Go back to your apartments.
- We heard screams.

321
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,932
Well, at least
get out of the way.

322
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,476
- Are they with you?
- Yeah. They're shadowing us.

323
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,395
Then they're your
responsibility.

324
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,981
I tell you not to film
something, don't film it.

325
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,775
- I tell you to get lost, you get lost.
- No problem.

326
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,779
Here on the second floor on the
right. It's an old woman, lives alone.

327
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,866
Probably fell. Neighbors
heard screams, called it in.

328
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,451
What are those people doing?

329
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,412
You wouldn't believe the way
she screamed. It was crazy.

330
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,165
Neighbors say she's weird.
Doesn't talk to anybody.

331
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,583
She hasn't made a sound.

332
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,460
- Who are they?
- They're with Fire.

333
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,755
- I told them not to get in the way.
- Great. That's all we need.

334
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,682
Hello, ma'am, can you
hear me? It's L.A.P.D.

335
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,184
Ma'am, open up the door.

336
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,562
I'm here with paramedics.
We're gonna come in to help you.

337
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:04,066
If you're near the door, I
need you to move away from it.

338
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,902
- Hey, I got the keys.
- Then get in here, sir. Come on.

339
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,362
- 2A.
- Help us out here.

340
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,990
Just a second.
Yeah, here we are.

341
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,330
She must have added locks.

342
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,916
- I'm gonna do an intro.
- Yeah, you're good.

343
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,795
Okay. We're standing outside
an elderly woman's apartment.

344
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,172
Neighbors heard
screams and called 911.

345
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,716
The fire department's
about to begin the rescue.

346
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,679
Police say that she lives
alone, she's not very social-

347
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,017
I need you to get back,
brother, please, this time.

348
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,436
Ma'am, we're the police.

349
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,147
We're here to help you.

350
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,775
Ma'am? Ma'am?

351
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,111
Ma'am, can you hear us?

352
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,948
- What's her name?
- Mrs. Espinoza.

353
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,660
There's no need to worry, Mrs.
Espinoza. We're here to help you.

354
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,579
Okay, ma'am.

355
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,665
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

356
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,251
Everything's gonna be fine.

357
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,171
Ma'am? We're
right here, ma'am.

358
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,506
- It's okay.
- Ma'am.

359
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,678
- Jesus.
- Are you okay?

360
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,430
You okay? Come here.

361
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,182
Ma'am, it's

362
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,893
- Ma'am.
- We're here to help you.

363
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,565
It's all right, is there anybody else
in the apartment? Any more animals?

364
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,193
- It's gonna be okay, ma'am.
- All right.

365
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,445
It's okay, all right?

366
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,155
It's all right.

367
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,365
Ma'am, ma'am.

368
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,659
It's all right.
It's all right.

369
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,952
All right. Okay, okay.

370
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,287
Okay, all right.

371
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,539
All right. Are you hurt?

372
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,791
All right, are you hurt?

373
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,793
- No.
- Okay, okay.

374
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,962
We're gonna get you
some medical help.

375
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,798
No, no, no. Please, don't.

376
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,842
No, are you okay?
Are you okay, ma'am?

377
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,304
No, no, no.

378
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,765
Okay, okay, okay.

379
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,060
You're gonna be okay. You're
gonna be okay, all right?

380
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,687

00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,731

382
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,026
- Turn that thing off.
- Turn that off.

383
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,445
Give us some room.

384
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,572
- Come on, man.
- Gloves on, Danny.

385
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,324
Where's that
blood coming from?

386
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,494
Hey, chief, we're gonna
need an ambulance here.

387
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,870
Copy, On our way,

388
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,165
Mrs. Espinoza, it's
all gonna be all right.

389
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,794
All right, I just need
you to calm down, okay?

390
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,048
It's all right. Nobody's
here to hurt you.

391
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,425
We can't help you
unless you calm down.

392
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:39,096
- An ambulance is on its way right now.
- All right.

393
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,723
Let's just clear a space.

394
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,686
Danny, get everybody out of here
until the ambulance gets here.

395
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,779
Get her off. Get
off. Get her off.

396
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,285
Get him on the floor.
Get him on the floor.

397
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,745
No. We are not moving him.

398
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,915
- We are waiting for the ambulance.
- Do you see an ambulance?

399
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,625
We have to get him downstairs.

400
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,421
- All right. Come on, come on. Okay.
- Grab the arm.

401
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,214
Come on. Come on, I got it.

402
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,633
Come on, lean down.

403
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,510
I got her. I got her.

404
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,179
Let's go.

405
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,431
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Go, Scott.

406
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,474
Move that camera.

407
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,185
Come on, let's go, let's go.

408
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,313
- Did we get that?
- Move, move, move.

409
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,857
- Let's go, open that door.
- Let's go.

410
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,776
- Be careful down the stairs.
- Hang in there, buddy.

411
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,237
Tape everything, you
hear me? Tape everything.

412
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,781
Move. Move. Move.

413
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,700
- Open the door.
- It's locked.

414
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,328
How can that be?

415
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,247
- Open it, open it.
- Open.

416
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,458
- What do you mean?
- They won't let us out.

417
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,627
- Who locked those doors?
- It's not us.

418
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,588
Something is closing
it from outside.

419
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,424
We need an ambulance.

420
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,053
Open the door. Open the door.

421
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,972
Is there a doctor
in the house?

422
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,682
- You're a doctor?
- I'm a vet.

423
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,142
- Come on.
- Get over here.

424
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,062
- Put some pressure on that wound.
- Give me that rag.

425
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,313
Get something.

426
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,565
- Back up, back up.
- Cover him up.

427
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,776
Why are they locking
if there's a fire?

428
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,737
There's no fire,
Wanda. There is no fire.

429
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,365
We have an officer down.
We have an officer down.

430
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,952
I need an ambulance
immediately. I need backup.

431
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,079
Does anybody copy?

432
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,373
I have a fucking
hurt officer here.

433
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,125
What's going on?
Hey, what's happening?

434
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,752
Why can't we leave?

435
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,754
I know no more than
you do right now.

436
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,090
Back up.

437
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,008
My partner's on
the floor bleeding.

438
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,594
- Quiet.
- Please remain calm,

439
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,347
We are working hard to get
you out of the building,

440
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,599
Please follow the
officers' instructions,

441
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,309
This will all be over shortly,

442
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,812
- What will all be over?
- What's going on?

443
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,730
Why are we locked
in our building?

444
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,524
Be calm. That's
what that means.

445
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,944
Please remain calm and everything's
- Get the camera out of here.

446
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,738
Don't touch the camera. We
have every right to shoot.

447
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:05,075
- I'm tired of the camera.
- People need to see what's going on.

448
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,952
I'm in charge
here. Turn it off-

449
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:10,080
If you were, you'd be worried
about getting your partner out.

450
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,665
Not whether we're shooting.

451
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:15,085
You are two steps from
being arrested, okay?

452
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:16,795
This man will bleed to death.

453
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:20,924
Everybody stop fighting,
okay? Stop fighting.

454
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,677
We need to get this
man out of here.

455
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,930
- What's behind that door?
- That's a fabric workshop.

456
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,433
- What is it?
- Fabric, fabric.

457
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,353
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yeah, through the back. Come, come.

458
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,817
- Keep them back.
- Please, please.

459
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,695
You're not helping
the situation. Okay?

460
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,947
My husband's outside.
Said there are cops.

461
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,658
Blocked off the street.
He was getting antibiotics.

462
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,911
We gotta do something-

463
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,579
What the fuck.

464
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,247
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

465
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,626
- Oh, Jesus, Fletch.
- Oh, my God.

466
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,377
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay, come on.

467
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,796
- Don't move him.
- No, we have to, we have to.

468
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,466
- Don't move him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

469
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,344
All right, he's
still got a pulse.

470
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,637
Shit.

471
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,056
Get the vet over
here. Get the vet now.

472
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,934
- Vet, here, now.
- Get over here.

473
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,810
- Come here.
- Keep an eye on him.

474
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,021
He's still got a
pulse. Take care of him.

475
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,397
Okay, back away.

476
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,067
All right. Come
with me, let's go.

477
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,611
Come on, come on. You
two stay here, all right?

478
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:23,904
Stay here.

479
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,781
Keep an eye on my
partner, please.

480
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,533
Come on.

481
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:33,038
Let's get upstairs.

482
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,082
Come on, let's get upstairs.

483
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,125
I'm coming.

484
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,470
The sound's coming
from in there.

485
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,305
Okay.

486
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,935
Move over.

487
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,823
Oh, Scott, don't.

488
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,411
Don't go in there, Scott.

489
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,247
Scott.

490
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,762
- Watch out.
- Oh, my God.

491
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,939
She's dead.

492
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,149
She's dead.

493
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:26,068
- She's dead.
- What?

494
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,779
What are you two doing
here? Get the camera back.

495
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,198
We need to get you
guys out of here.

496
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,117
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?

497
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,287
Ma'am, listen to me. Can
you hear me, Miss Espinoza?

498
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,082
I need you to stay right
where you are, okay?

499
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,125
All right? We
wanna help you here.

500
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,295
Put your hands in the
air for me, Mrs. Espinoza.

501
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,674
Okay? Put your
hands in the air.

502
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,555
Oh, my God.

503
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,066
Let's go.

504
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,820
Put the gun down. Let's go.

505
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,364
- She was coming right at us.
- Yeah.

506
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,658
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, I saw it.

507
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,619
Shit. Okay.

508
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,581
Okay, you saw that, right?

509
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,541
Okay. All right.

510
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:26,295
Let's just get downstairs.
Let's get downstairs.

511
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,298
Hey, hey, hey.

512
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,759
Easy, easy, easy.

513
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,561
Did you get that?

514
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,146
Yeah.

515
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,076
Show it to me.

516
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,829
- Look, don't worry. I got it.
- I said show it to me!.

517
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,956
Okay. Okay, okay.

518
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,586
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I think-

519
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,839
Is everything okay?

520
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,843
We should probably just
get down the stairs, okay?

521
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,763
I know, I know, I know.

522
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,516
- Oh, my God.
- We just have to get downstairs.

523
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,269
Fire department.

524
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,771
I need you to
open up the door.

525
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,903
Fire department.

526
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:23,453
Fire department. We need everyone
to gather downstairs in the atrium.

527
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,414
Yes, we need you
to go downstairs.

528
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:29,418
- Was there a fire?
- No, it's just a precaution.

529
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:31,962
Just a precaution for what?

530
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,882
Look, we just need
you to get downstairs.

531
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,347
Does this have anything to
do with the cable being out?

532
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,809
- Come on, let's go.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.

533
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:49,813
- What if I don't wanna go?
- Then I'd be forced to force you.

534
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,108
Hi. I'm with the
fire department.

535
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,736
We need everyone to
gather in the atrium.

536
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:01,283
Do you speak English?

537
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:02,951
Do you speak English?

538
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,162
English? No.

539
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,499
Okay, we need everybody
downstairs, so...

540
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:13,962
All right, there's people down there,
and we need you two to go there.

541
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,590
You understand?

542
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,848
Fire department.

543
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,605
Fire department.

544
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,651
Ma'am?

545
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,028
Hello, ma'am?

546
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,497
Ma'am, I'm with
the fire department.

547
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,251
We need you to quickly and calmly
walk down to the lobby, please.

548
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,255
Excuse me, ma'am.

549
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:04,304
Ma'am.

550
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,183
Ma'am, we need you to
get downstairs, okay?

551
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,726
What's wrong with her?

552
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:11,562
I don't know.

553
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,984
- You wanna give me a hand?
- Yeah.

554
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,945
- I don't know that that's a good idea.
- She needs help.

555
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,572
Just grab her.

556
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,449
Okay. Now lift her up.

557
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,493
Okay.

558
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,538
We're just taking you
downstairs, okay, ma'am?

559
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,373
All right?

560
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,877
Oh, Jesus.

561
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,132
Okay? Okay?

562
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,927
Okay? Yeah.

563
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:47,389
Oh, she's really sick.

564
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:03,071
Holy shit. Did you see that?

565
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:08,410
That rat just totally came
after me. Hey, did you see that?

566
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,537
Come on.

567
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,668
Un- fucking-
believable.

568
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,130
- Oh, my God, look at Elise.
- Somebody grab that chair.

569
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:24,426
- What's wrong with her?
- Set her down, set her down.

570
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,763
Can't stop the bleeding. Get him
to a hospital. He's gonna die.

571
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,765
Stay here. I'm
gonna check the exit.

572
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,017
No, no, wait. We are
under strict orders-

573
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,603
We're under orders to
stay in the hall. Help me.

574
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,689
Fuck your orders, all
right? My friend's dying!

575
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,817
- I'm coming
out. - Do not-

576
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,279
- Didn't catch that. You're breaking up.
- Two people have died.

577
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:48,200
Two others are in need of medical
care. Police have blocked off the exit.

578
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:52,037
They've given us no explanation.
We're trying to find a way out.

579
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,330
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

580
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,415
- Get away from the window.
- Go, go.

581
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,918
You need to remain
in the building.

582
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,296
We have civilians in here.

583
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:18,772
Briana, don't.

584
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:22,901
Attention, please, Do not
try to leave the building,

585
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,613
All exits have been
sealed, Just stay calm,

586
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,117
We will send someone in there
shortly to assess the situation,

587
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:33,245
Thank you for
your cooperation,

588
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,873
What are we supposed to do?

589
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,168
- What are we supposed to do?
- Just wait.

590
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,684
There's five there.
What happened?

591
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,491
Sir, sir, sir.

592
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,784
Give me your headphones.

593
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:20,000
No, you're not
getting my question.

594
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:21,543
Not getting my question.

595
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,921
I'm asking why they're
calling this a BNC.

596
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:25,839
- What's a BNC?
- I don't know.

597
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,633
Hello?

598
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,176
Hello?

599
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:30,761
Hello?

600
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:32,179
- Hello?
- Hello?

601
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,973
- Is somebody there?
- Hello?

602
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:39,436
Honey, hello?

603
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,899
Why is the phone breaking?
Why is it not working?

604
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,944
- What's a BNC? - Who
said anything about-?

605
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,654
- You. You're still miked.
- Wait.

606
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,947
- What? -
Don't jump to-

607
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,865
What's a BNC? What is it?

608
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,576
They're calling this a BNC?

609
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,788
A biological, nuclear
or chemical threat.

610
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:59,456
- Oh, my God.
- Nuclear?

611
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,208
- What?
- No, don't worry, okay?

612
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,503
- It's more common than you think.
- Supposed to be reassuring?

613
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,131
Our cell phones don't work.
Neither do the TVs or our radios.

614
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,384
- Why are they isolating us?
- I don't know.

615
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,010
My daughter has a fever.

616
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,429
- What does she have?
- They're pointing guns.

617
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,139
You can't keep
us trapped here.

618
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,058
- We're all trapped.
- That's right.

619
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,894
We are all trapped in
here. Step over here.

620
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,479
- Here.
- What will they do?

621
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,274
- Step over here, please.
- Jake, Jake.

622
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,445
There might be
- From the office on the second floor, there is an overhang.

623
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:34,074
Maybe we can use to
jump down to the patio.

624
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,076
- Let's go.
- I show you.

625
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,995
I'm going with you.

626
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,878
Don't turn the light on.

627
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,505
I don't want anyone
knowing we're in here.

628
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,553
Careful.

629
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:14,948
- When I open the
window- - Yeah?

630
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,909
go to the right side and jump.

631
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,786
It's only two
and a half meters.

632
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,003
Get away from the window.

633
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,588
- For your own safety.
- No.

634
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,507
- Step away.
- Wait, wait, wait.

635
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,217
- Step away.
- Wait, listen.

636
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,802
Can you see me?
Can you see me?

637
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:39,640
- What are you doing?
- We have a film crew in here.

638
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,601
Tell your boss we
have a TV crew in here.

639
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:46,772
We are filming
this. Please, wait.

640
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,191
People are gonna see
what you're doing to us.

641
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,487
- Why can't we go out?
- People are gonna see this.

642
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,244
Please. Wait.

643
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,496
What are you doing in here?

644
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,915
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- Knew what?

645
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:07,292
That they're
sealing us in here.

646
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,920
What the fuck is this?

647
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:14,049
- What is going on?
- You tell us.

648
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:17,803
I don't know anything and don't you
fucking put your hands on me again.

649
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,056
I don't know anything, okay?

650
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,016
Get this fucking camera out.

651
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,269
- Don't touch me.
- Don't touch that camera.

652
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,729
We need to show people
what's going on here.

653
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:29,815
- Only proof we have.
- Don't you get it?

654
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:33,402
You're locked in here like us. You
think they give a shit about you?

655
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,904
- Step back.
- Hey, hey, hey.

656
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:38,615
- Let's all just calm down, all right?
- Shut up.

657
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,618
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up.

658
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,621
Go back downstairs now, okay?

659
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,331
Yeah, okay, okay, but-

660
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,167
Shut up!

661
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,170
Damn. Go back downstairs.

662
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:53,338
This thing is
getting to all of us.

663
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,841
No one here is
gonna hurt you, okay?

664
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,719
We're trying to get out.
That's all we're trying to do.

665
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,388
Just put the gun down.

666
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,810
I'm sorry, man.

667
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,647
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Yeah.

668
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,524
I was just freaked
out. Let's go.

669
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,485
- We all are.
- Go downstairs, okay?

670
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,863
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get downstairs, man.

671
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,407
Shit.

672
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,784
Fuck.

673
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,888
Grab his legs, okay?
Come on, let's go.

674
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,265
What we'll do is we'll
roll him on his side.

675
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:49,102
We just have to
be really careful.

676
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:53,482
- What time is it?
- One- thirty- seven.

677
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,611
Five, four, three...

678
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:01,073
It's 1:37 in the morning,
and everyone is scared.

679
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,117
They've given us no information,
cut off communication...

680
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:08,121
...from walkie talkies and cell phones
to the building's cable and Internet.

681
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,500
The people trapped
here, myself included...

682
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:14,253
...can't help but ask why.

683
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,490
How's he doing?

684
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,577
Well, he's not good.

685
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,001
Yeah.

686
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,715
Yeah.

687
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,926
Excuse me. It's
Terrence, right?

688
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,180
- No, Lawrence.
- Lawrence, right.

689
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:10,350
Listen, I've got a ton of Vicodin
in my apartment, if that will help.

690
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:11,977
Yeah, that's gonna help.

691
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,104
I'll just
- I'll grab a bunch of stuff.

692
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:17,774
I basically got a
pharmacy up there.

693
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:22,321
You can't arrest me for that,
because of self- incrimination-

694
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:26,241
Sir, you are the least of
my worries right now, okay?

695
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,785
- All right, I was just asking.
- Go.

696
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,079
Do what you're
gonna do, please.

697
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:34,791
I'm going. I'm going.

698
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,591
You ever seen anything
like this before?

699
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:45,719
No, I've never seen
anything like this.

700
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,305
Mostly because I'm a vet.

701
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:52,226
I don't usually treat
people. Dogs and cats, mostly.

702
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,979
All I can really do is I can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them.

703
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,023
How are the injured men doing?

704
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,151
They both lost a lot of blood,
and the fireman over here...

705
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,906
...he's got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding.

706
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:13,163
Apparently, Mrs. Espinoza attacked
and bit them in some kind of a fit.

707
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,125
But honestly, I find that
a little hard to believe...

708
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:22,506
...that an old lady could do
something like this to two grown men.

709
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,260
Ready? Ready to film?

710
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,595
Okay.

711
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,390
- What's your name?
- Briana.

712
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:35,185
Briana, that's a very pretty
name. How old are you, Briana?

713
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:39,064
- Five.
- And who do you live with?

714
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:42,943
With my mom and my
dad and my dog, Max.

715
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:45,904
Max. I haven't met
Max. Where is he?

716
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:49,158
My dad took him to the
vet because he's sick.

717
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:52,161
- You sound a little sick yourself.
- Yeah.

718
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,248
- She's had it for weeks,
it's not like- - You know what?

719
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,960
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep
you quiet while I interview Briana.

720
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,046
It confuses the audience when
people talk from of fcamera.

721
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,465
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

722
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,051
- I'll interview you afterwards.
- No, that's fine.

723
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,636
- Okay.
- We don't need that.

724
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,889
Okay, thank you.

725
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,558
I don't like being sick.

726
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:17,394
Yeah, I don't like
being sick either.

727
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:19,563
Briana, you're a
very brave girl...

728
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,232
...and I'm really happy
we got a chance to meet.

729
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,525
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

730
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,736
She's been fearless
since she was little.

731
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,197
She's an incredibly
strong child.

732
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,990
Okay? Okay.

733
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,701
Why don't you just start
by introducing yourselves?

734
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:36,121
Well, I'm Ber
- I'm Bernard. This is my roommate, Sadie.

735
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,581
And this is Martini.

736
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,917
And how long have you
lived in the building?

737
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,627
I've lived here six years.

738
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,629
I've been here two
and a half years.

739
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,006
And what do you
do for a living?

740
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,466
I'm an opera teacher.

741
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:50,886
Sadie's my best
student, my protege.

742
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:57,059
- Oh, my God.
- Fletcher.

743
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,102
Where's the vet?

744
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,437
Oh, my God.

745
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:03,023
Where the hell is the doctor?

746
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,484
I got him, got him, got him.

747
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:09,404
Hold him, hold him. Hold
his neck, hold his neck.

748
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:10,739
What is that?

749
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:13,700
- Hold it over, hold his neck.
- Go, go, go.

750
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,994
Oh, my God, is he still alive?

751
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,122
Hold him still, hold him
still. He's gonna go down.

752
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,836
Martini.

753
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:26,088
Sadie, stay here. Stay.

754
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:29,216
No, no, stay here, stay here.
No, the dog will come back.

755
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,301
Martini.

756
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,136
Hold him.

757
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:46,108
- Okay, I have to show you something.
- What?

758
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,193
Have to show you
something. Just a sec.

759
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:50,112
I think I know what this is.

760
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:55,784
- Come, come look, look, look.
- Oh, Jesus.

761
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,871
Her tear ducts and salivary
glands are constantly flowing.

762
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:01,540
She seems to be unable
to swallow or speak.

763
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,375
She has a fever,
she's confused.

764
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:06,170
She has some degree of
paralysis and delirium.

765
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:10,090
These are all rabies symptoms.

766
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,758
- Are you sure?
- I'm a vet.

767
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,803
Never seen it in humans, but
I know what rabies look like.

768
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:17,556
Are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies?

769
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,433
Tears, saliva, fever.

770
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,145
Tears, saliva, fever.
They have what she has.

771
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:26,648
But here's the thing. Rabies
takes months for symptoms to show.

772
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:30,277
This is taking minutes. I mean,
rabies never acts this fast.

773
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,321
How does rabies
spread? Through bites?

774
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:36,116
No, it's passed through anything wet.
Blood, saliva, any mucous membrane.

775
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:39,495
So if you get their
blood on you, you're okay.

776
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,497
But if you get
their blood on you...

777
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:44,124
...and it gets into a cut,
into your mouth, eyes...

778
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,627
...then you're not okay.

779
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,670
How's it cured?

780
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,423
No, there's no cure.

781
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,717
People get shots
in their stomach.

782
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:55,427
Before symptoms
starts showing.

783
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:59,806
Once symptoms show, rabies
is 100 percent fatal.

784
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,768
Shit.

785
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,854
Yeah, shit.

786
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:11,109
- Where are you going? Where?
- I'm going up to my apartment.

787
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,070
- What?
- I am going upstairs.

788
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,404
You can't do that.

789
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,781
- Why?
- Come down.

790
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,157
- Why?
- What do you mean?

791
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,576
- Why can't I go?
- We gonna do this all night?

792
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:21,912
- You know why?
- Because it's not safe there.

793
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,832
Oh, yeah, because it's
really safe down here.

794
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,625
- You're drunk.
- You know what?

795
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:30,045
It seems to me, if this is
spreading, maybe we should separate...

796
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:32,339
...instead of sitting
here in a big group.

797
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,551
You done? You finished?

798
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,010
- You done?
- You know what?

799
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:42,099
I have a God given right to protect
myself as I see fit, so you know what?

800
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,226
- I'm gonna go
upstairs- - Step back.

801
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:47,437
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
barricade the shit out of it.

802
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:51,150
- Where do you think they're going?
- You can all sit here and rot.

803
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,235
Oh, you are so close
to going to jail.

804
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:57,072
- Are you some kind of affirmative-?
- You are so close to going to jail.

805
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,615
- Hey.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

806
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:00,492
- What?
- Where are you going?

807
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,203
Look, this lets out right
next to our apartment.

808
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,123
We wanna see if there's
anything on the news about this.

809
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,708
- But the cable's out.
- Cable?

810
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,377
We still use rabbit
ears on our TV.

811
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:14,298
We're going with you. Wait,
wait, wait, we're going with you.

812
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,303
It's just up
here to the right.

813
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:26,977
You're good?

814
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:29,605
- Stop. Just stop.
- What?

815
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:31,106
Go back downstairs.

816
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,901
The door locked behind me.

817
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,695
Just stay there.

818
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,156
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

819
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:41,158
Hey, look out.

820
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:43,202
- Oh, my God!
- Look out.

821
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:46,622
No, no, no!

822
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:54,129
We can't just open the door. We need
something to hold the dog back with.

823
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:58,383
- Find something!
- There's a fire extinguisher.

824
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,762
Oh, my God.

825
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,265
Stop, stop.

826
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,184
Listen.

827
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:12,981
Turn it off,
Scott. Turn it off.

828
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,902
Oh, I forgot something.

829
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,530
- Shouldn't we shut the door?
- Close the door.

830
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:23,325
- Okay.
- I left the music on.

831
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,035
Folk music.

832
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,287
The TV's back here.

833
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,248
All right.

834
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,417
Okay.

835
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:35,504
It usually takes a
couple of seconds to...

836
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,965
There we go, all right.

837
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:40,509
- Fiddle with this-
- Make sure that-

838
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:42,219
No, I know what I'm doing.

839
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,346
- No, I'm- - Yeah,
I know, all right?

840
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,807
- ... third hour of our coverage,
- There.

841
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,893
- There it is.

842
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:53,313
hind me was comp
- Evacuated...

843
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:59,444
that the CDC...

844
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,281
Chief,

845
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:06,076
Tell us why the CDC is
entering the building,

846
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:10,247
Precaution, Everyone's
been evacuated,

847
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,041
What?

848
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,419
Why would he broadcast that?

849
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,254
Why would he say that?

850
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:20,174
What the fuck
is going on here?

851
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:24,636
- What happened?
- Power's out.

852
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,347
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

853
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:31,185
- What was that?
- Quiet.

854
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,275
Sadie, stay with
me. Sadie, come here.

855
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,195
Sadie, come over here.

856
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,531
Stay with me. It cannot be.

857
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,783
- Stay with me.
- You gotta close that door.

858
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,994
Sadie, look out.

859
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:52,873
- Get off me.
- Oh, my God.

860
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,918
Get off of me.

861
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:02,257
Bernard, stay with me.

862
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:12,935
Hit her again!

863
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,033
Oh, my God.

864
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:37,417
Angela, you have blood
all over your shirt.

865
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,033
- Scott.
- What?

866
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,287
Scott.

867
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:19,418
What do you want?

868
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,172
You okay?

869
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:26,550
Yeah, I'm just fine.

870
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:29,261
I mean, I just killed
something with my camera...

871
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:32,055
...and, you know,
I'm just fine.

872
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,057
Yeah.

873
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,186
Scott.

874
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,731
What, Angela? What you...?

875
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,609
I need a moment now.

876
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,739
I'm with you.

877
00:49:55,078 --> 00:50:00,626
- I'm with you, you're with me, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay, we're here.

878
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,754
We're here
together, all right?

879
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:07,090
We get out of here as fast as
we fucking can, you hear me?

880
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:09,593
- Okay, okay.
- Together?

881
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:14,640
- That everybody?
- Getting the last one.

882
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,017
All right, keep going.

883
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,813
All right, it's been a long,
exhausting night for all of us...

884
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:23,357
...but we just got
word from outside.

885
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,026
Well, it's about bloody
fucking time, isn't it?

886
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,445
Yes, they told me they're
sending in the CDC.

887
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:29,947
- CDC? -
What's-?

888
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:31,865
- Center for Disease Control.
- Why?

889
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,493
Yes, but relax, it's fine.
They're gonna come in.

890
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:37,704
They're gonna run blood tests
on residents to clarify things.

891
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:40,791
- Just the residents?
- No, everybody.

892
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,876
Everybody, so once
they check it out...

893
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:46,129
...make sure everything's okay,
we should be able to get out.

894
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,923
- Oh, thank God.
- That won't work.

895
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:51,593
- What are you talking about?
- That doesn't work, not for rabies.

896
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,514
- Nobody said anything about rabies.
- I did, I told you it was rabies.

897
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,349
How do you test for rabies?

898
00:50:57,558 --> 00:51:00,143
There's only one way. You
gotta get a brain sample.

899
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,728
- Come on.
- Man, just shut up.

900
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,648
- What you have to do.
- Let's make sure everyone's here.

901
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:06,358
A simple "here" will be fine.

902
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:08,986
So let's get started.

903
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,572
- How many units per floor?
- Three.

904
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:12,906
- There are three.
- Okay.

905
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,784
Second floor, Unit A, that's
where Mrs. Espinoza lives?

906
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,369
- Yes.
- Who's in B?

907
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,121
- Me and Sadie.
- Here.

908
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,290
Who's in Unit C?

909
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,708
Unit C.

910
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,626
The lawyer.

911
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:25,878
- Randy.
- Elevat-

912
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:28,463
All right, third floor,
Unit A. Who's up there?

913
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,633
That's me, my daughter and my
husband, who's been outside-

914
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:33,677
Yes, yes, yes, we
know. Thank you.

915
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:35,470
- Unit B, please.
- Us.

916
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,639
- My wife and me.
- Who's in Unit C?

917
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:39,224
- Vacant.
- Why we doing this?

918
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,143
- Vacant. -
Nobody's been there-

919
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,980
- Fourth floor, Unit A, who's up there?
- That was Elise. She's dead.

920
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,065
- What?
- She's dead?

921
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:50,777
- 4B, who's in B?
- It's me, me, here.

922
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:55,199
- Who's in C?
- It's them.

923
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:56,492
You two?

924
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:59,453
They don't understand
you. Them and her father.

925
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:03,081
- And her father's upstairs?
- Sick, he's paralytic.

926
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,626
Maybe this is all his fault.

927
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:09,505
- How do you know? You don't know- -
Listen up, all right, let's finish up.

928
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:12,132
- Okay.
- Somebody knows.

929
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:15,135
What was I even gonna say?
Who lives in the attic?

930
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:20,057
A man from Boston. He rents it,
but I haven't seen him in months.

931
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:23,060
Wait, if her father's upstairs,
should we bring him down?

932
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:26,021
What if he's the cause? We
can't bring sick people here.

933
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,483
- Your daughter's sick, isn't she?
- She has fever. Hardly the same.

934
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:31,985
Yeah, so we should bring
her father downstairs.

935
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,821
- Hey, hey.
- Stop, stop it.

936
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,656
- Hey.
- Stop fighting.

937
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,991
- Listen.
- How many times you gonna do this?

938
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:39,993
Nobody's going.
We're gonna stay here.

939
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:43,330
They'll let us know when
they wanna move us, period.

940
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:45,165
Can we finish?

941
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,500
- Fine.
- Thank you.

942
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,293
The cleaning lady.

943
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:49,711
Yeah, the cleaning lady.

944
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:52,631
- The cleaning lady was here.
- I saw her this morning.

945
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:54,550
She's deceased.

946
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,093
- What?
- What did he say?

947
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,011
- What?
- She's gone.

948
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,941
stand back from the door,

949
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:13,735
Open the door.

950
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:16,446
- Show me your hands.
- L.A.P.D.

951
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,588
CDC's now making their
way into the building.

952
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,673
There are security
measures in place.

953
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,884
We still have no
idea what's happening.

954
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,928
From the look of the precaution
that they're taking...

955
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,556
...it's something
very serious.

956
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:47,686
I want you to just
keep this area clear.

957
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,262
This is...

958
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,389
This is blood from
my partner here.

959
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:28,977
He's in the back. This blood
is from the second firefighter.

960
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,026
You, turn it off.
Turn it off now.

961
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:37,361
Now. Turn it off.

962
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:39,279
Okay, okay, it's off.

963
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,532
Jesus.

964
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,202
Okay, everyone here.
Everybody here is good.

965
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,205
The two guys are in the back.
That's all we can tell you.

966
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:50,999
- I don't know anything else right now.
- Okay.

967
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:54,002
Just take me to the injured.
Everyone else stays here.

968
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,296
You heard him. Stay here.

969
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,592
Clear this area.

970
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:08,725
They tell us to stay calm, and
they come dressed like that?

971
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:13,397
- It's gonna be all right.
- What? You honestly believe that?

972
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,658
I'm gonna open it.

973
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,709
Can you see?

974
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,252
That's good. That's good.

975
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:38,630
I'm gonna take
samples from both men.

976
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:56,148
Up here. Up here.

977
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:57,733
- Okay.
- Can you get up there?

978
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,693
Yeah, okay, cool.

979
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:03,071
Hey, hold this, hold this.

980
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,868
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

981
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:09,620
You got it?

982
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,373
Okay, give it to me.

983
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,667
Give me the camera, come on.

984
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:18,420
Give me the camera.

985
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:24,051
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

986
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,178
What's happening?

987
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:29,223
- They're handcuffing him.
- Who?

988
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,183
Fletcher.

989
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:45,197
The other one's got a syringe.

990
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,337
He just gave Fletcher a shot.

991
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:28,490
- Oh, shit.
- What?

992
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:30,909
He's got a drill.

993
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:39,543
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

994
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,296
I think the vet was right.

995
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:52,890
I think he's taking
a brain sample.

996
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:19,416
- Holy shit.
- Scott?

997
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,419
Hey, look out.

998
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:36,683
Angela, run. Run!

999
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:40,604
The vet's in there.
He's still in there.

1000
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,940
- Open the door.
- We can't, he's been bitten.

1001
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,984
- Come on, let him out.
- I'm not infected, you're wrong.

1002
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,736
I'm not infected.
I'm all right.

1003
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:50,322
- They didn't get me.
- What are you talking about?

1004
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:53,992
- Are you sure he's been bitten?
- Yes, and I'm not taking any chances.

1005
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,954
Back away till the infected
people have been handcuffed.

1006
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:59,039
Infected with what?

1007
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:02,668
- Would you get that out of my face?
- What happens happens in the open.

1008
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:05,754
They have a right
to shoot this, okay?

1009
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,051
- You okay?
- Lawrence.

1010
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,803
Lawrence, you okay?

1011
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,222
God, this isn't right.

1012
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,932
Calm down, calm down. No.

1013
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,395
- It's not right. - It would
not be right to let him out-

1014
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:29,820
You tell us what's going on.

1015
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,947
- I'm not authorized
to tell- - Bullshit.

1016
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,616
You left my friend because
he tried to kill you.

1017
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,909
Tell us what you know.

1018
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,996
- Tell us what you know.
- Yeah, okay, goddamn, okay.

1019
00:59:39,163 --> 00:59:42,207
We got a call from a vet who
had a sick dog brought in.

1020
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,919
They ran the routine tests, it was
nothing they'd ever seen before.

1021
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:48,338
Then it started attacking
the other animals.

1022
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:50,799
And within an hour, all
the injured animals...

1023
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:53,844
...showed the same
kind of aggression.

1024
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:57,931
Yeah. The dog's collar
led us to this building.

1025
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,435
Was the dog's name Max?

1026
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,187
Yes.

1027
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:10,652
- She only has bronchitis.
- Bullshit, bronchitis.

1028
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:13,572
- No, don't you dare.
- Kathy.

1029
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,407
- Bronchitis.
- We need to find out.

1030
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:17,576
Relax, ma'am. Relax.
We have to be sure.

1031
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:19,077
No, get away from me.

1032
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:21,455
Dog spread the infection
through his saliva.

1033
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:22,789
We just gotta check.

1034
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:24,541
- Let him do a check, ma'am.
- No.

1035
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,876
That's all we gotta do.

1036
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,587
That's all she has,
just bronchitis.

1037
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:31,006
- No.
- Go, go.

1038
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:33,425
Get back. Get back.

1039
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:35,844
Get back. Watch out.

1040
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:39,348
Run, Briana. Run, sweetheart.

1041
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:41,517
- Get the girl.
- No, get away from her.

1042
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:43,769
- Hold her. Hold her.
- Run!

1043
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,021
- Run, sweetie, please!
- Get the handcuffs.

1044
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,982
- Come on, come on.
- No, let me go.

1045
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,859
Don't hurt her. Please!

1046
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:52,986
Please, you need to
get us out of here.

1047
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,739
Stop it! Stop it!

1048
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,616
- Cuff her.
- No.

1049
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:58,909
Come here. Come.

1050
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:00,577
- Honey.
- She's cuffed.

1051
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:02,037
- Honey.
- Back away.

1052
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:05,791
Back away. Calm down,
calm down, calm down.

1053
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:07,793
- No.
- Father.

1054
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,086
- Father.
- What father?

1055
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:11,672
- Her father's sick in bed.
- Nobody told me that.

1056
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,590
We thought everyone
was down here.

1057
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:16,093
All right, here. Take this.

1058
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,136
Get the girl and
inject her with it.

1059
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,597
- No, no.
- And you, bring everybody down here.

1060
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,558
Bring Briana. Okay.

1061
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,477
Kathy, we're gonna get her.
We're gonna bring her down.

1062
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,396
- Run, honey!
- Going up.

1063
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:29,439
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- Get away!

1064
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:33,861
Get away from her! Honey.

1065
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:36,280
Briana.

1066
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:37,823
Run!

1067
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,325
Honey.

1068
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:43,370
Briana.

1069
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:45,706
Get away from her.

1070
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,416
Oh, God.

1071
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:49,960
Slow down, slow
down, slow down.

1072
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:57,050
Okay, okay. All right.

1073
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:00,971
Briana?

1074
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:04,516
Oh, God.

1075
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,689
- Where the hell's the old lady?
- The old lady's gone.

1076
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:16,111
Briana?

1077
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:19,114
Okay. Just take it easy, okay?

1078
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,116
Briana?

1079
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,959
Briana?

1080
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:41,845
Oh, Briana.

1081
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:44,932
- Briana?
- Briana?

1082
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:47,100
Shit.

1083
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:49,812
Shit, I'm sorry.

1084
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:54,024
Briana?

1085
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:03,200
Oh, shit.

1086
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,832
Briana?

1087
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:14,795
Oh, I think she's
in here, Jake.

1088
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,924
Hell.

1089
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,178
She's over there.
She's over there.

1090
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,138
You all right?

1091
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,183
Now, I need you to
give me your hand, okay?

1092
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,269
Okay?

1093
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:32,813
What happened to her eyes?

1094
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,738
Please don't stop.
Please, don't.

1095
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,740
Get her off me.

1096
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,160
Go, go.

1097
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:48,871
She bit me. Go, Jake!

1098
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,627
- Get out of here.
- Go, go, go.

1099
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,880
Come on, go. Let's go.

1100
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,923
- Go, go, go.
- They're getting out.

1101
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,925
They're getting out.

1102
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:03,927
No, no, no.

1103
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:05,804
- Go back.
- They're getting out.

1104
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:10,017
Oh, they're getting
out. Run, run!

1105
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:26,325
Don't go. Wait!

1106
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:33,582
They're getting close. Run.

1107
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:36,543
Okay. Run! Run!

1108
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:38,837
Don't leave me.

1109
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:42,049
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave her.

1110
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:44,635
- Don't leave me.
- We have to get out of here.

1111
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:48,472
It's not right!
It's not right!

1112
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:58,357
- Come on.
- No, no, not that way. This way.

1113
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,031
Hurry up, come on.
Where are the others?

1114
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,324
Come on, let's go.

1115
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:11,328
Hurry up.

1116
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,331
- Lock it, lock it, lock it!
- Hurry up.

1117
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:33,892
Help me, help me.

1118
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,203
- Were you bitten?
- No.

1119
01:05:53,412 --> 01:05:55,122
- You?
- No.

1120
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,541
- You?
- No.

1121
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,334
Scott?

1122
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,462
Scott?

1123
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,340
- Were you bitten?
- No.

1124
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:08,135
Angie?

1125
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,429
No.

1126
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:15,392
- Hey, what about you?
- No, no.

1127
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,729
Hey, you.

1128
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:20,230
On the floor.

1129
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:23,817
- Hey, you been bitten?
- No, no.

1130
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:27,070
Jake, did you find
the little girl?

1131
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:29,364
Who gives a shit
about the little girl?

1132
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,992
All right. We've lost
control of the building.

1133
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:33,911
We're fucked.

1134
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:36,163
Damn it.

1135
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,124
I don't understand.

1136
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,837
I don't understand. They
were biting her face off.

1137
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:45,964
I don't know what
the fuck is happening.

1138
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:47,883
- Damn it.
- I don't understand.

1139
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,011
We could all be infected by
now. We gotta get out of here.

1140
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:52,513
I'm not moving. I'm done.

1141
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:55,140
- I'm not moving.
- Hey, we wait here, we wait here.

1142
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:57,184
- We have to get out of here.
- Listen.

1143
01:06:57,351 --> 01:07:01,438
We have to stay here and wait
till somebody come and get us.

1144
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:03,357
They're not gonna
come and get us.

1145
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:05,776
- Oh, yes, they will.
- They are not gonna come!

1146
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:08,904
They don't give a shit about
us! They're gonna let us die!

1147
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:11,782
They don't care about us.

1148
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:15,536
Scott, we're gonna die!

1149
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,622
- Oh, fuck.
- She's right.

1150
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:20,499
- Who was that?
- It was the doctor.

1151
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:21,917
What?

1152
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:24,211
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I've been bit.

1153
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:25,587
You left us down there.

1154
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:27,422
Piece of shit.

1155
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:29,633
I've been bitten.

1156
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,677
He's been bitten.

1157
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,971
He's been bitten. Get back.

1158
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:35,514
Close those doors.

1159
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,559
Somebody close
those fucking doors.

1160
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:44,690
It won't hold him.

1161
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:48,402
It's not gonna
hold him for long.

1162
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:50,404
- Get back.
- She's bleeding.

1163
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:52,531
She's bleeding.

1164
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:59,329
Sadie.

1165
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:01,748
No.

1166
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:03,500
We have to kill her.

1167
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:06,086
No, no.

1168
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:12,176
Hey, hey, hey, you're not
gonna fucking touch her.

1169
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:13,927
We gotta get out.
Gotta get out.

1170
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:16,847
Gotta get out of here. Gotta
get out of here. Come on.

1171
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:19,308
Help me get out of here.

1172
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:21,768
Let me get out
of here, please.

1173
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:24,146
Hey, hey.

1174
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,773
Please. Hey!

1175
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:29,234
Hey. Hey.

1176
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:31,153
Please, get me-

1177
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:32,779
Oh, my God.

1178
01:08:32,946 --> 01:08:35,157
Sniper!

1179
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,685
Scott.

1180
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:09,107
They're not gonna let us
out of here alive, are they?

1181
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,943
No.

1182
01:09:11,902 --> 01:09:13,946
I don't think so.

1183
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:20,160
- There might be a way out.
- What?

1184
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:23,831
Jake, there might
be a way out.

1185
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,128
How? How do we
get out of here?

1186
01:09:38,554 --> 01:09:40,556
Listen, Jake.

1187
01:09:40,722 --> 01:09:44,726
There is a drain cover in the
basement that joins up with the sewers.

1188
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:49,022
- We need the key, we need the key.
- The keys are in our apartment.

1189
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:01,410
Come with us.

1190
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:04,288
Come with us! You
have to come with us!

1191
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:06,832
I won't leave him.
I can't leave him.

1192
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:09,209
Leave him alone.

1193
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:14,798
Oh, my God!

1194
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:17,509
We have to get out of here!
We have to get the key.

1195
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:20,053
Key's in Yuri's apartment.
Know where he lives?

1196
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:23,015
You made the list of
residents. Where does he live?

1197
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:24,766
I can't remember
where it's at.

1198
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:27,352
You have to think about
it. Think, think, think.

1199
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,396
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Think!

1200
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:32,983
I don't know which apartment. I
don't know which apartment it is.

1201
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,861
Mailboxes, mailboxes.

1202
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:37,905
Mailboxes.

1203
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:52,586
Yeah, get the hammer.

1204
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:54,671
- Grab the hammer.
- I got it, I got it.

1205
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:57,132
- Go.
- Keep moving.

1206
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:00,594
Oh, keep moving,
man. Keep moving.

1207
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:02,638
I'm coming.

1208
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:18,153
Where is it? Which one is it?

1209
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:19,696
Hurry.

1210
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:21,323
Yuri Ivanov, 3B.

1211
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:22,908
Three. Get to the elevator.

1212
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:25,702
- Three. Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

1213
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:27,746
Get to the elevator.

1214
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:29,456
But the electricity?

1215
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:32,459
It should run on auxiliary
power. We're good.

1216
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,337
She's cuffed. We can get by.

1217
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:46,974
Come on. Come on.

1218
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,893
Come on.

1219
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:53,647
- Oh, God.
- Get in.

1220
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:55,023
Get in.

1221
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:58,694
Get in. Get in.

1222
01:11:59,069 --> 01:12:01,864
Hurry! Hurry. Hurry.

1223
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:04,575
Close the fucking door.

1224
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:10,581
Easy, easy.

1225
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:13,542
But it's gonna stop at two.
We're gonna stop at two!

1226
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:15,586
- The light, the light!
- I'll get it.

1227
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:18,172
- I'm fixing it, come on.
- The light.

1228
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:23,886
Come on. Come on, you
should get that hammer, Jake.

1229
01:12:32,978 --> 01:12:36,023
They won't close.
They won't close.

1230
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,533
It's go
- It's gonna go.

1231
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:48,785
Oh, it's gonna go.

1232
01:12:58,337 --> 01:13:00,297
- Oh, shit.
- Scott.

1233
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:03,258
Scott.

1234
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,302
Scott!

1235
01:13:05,469 --> 01:13:07,054
Get off me.

1236
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,477
No!

1237
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,460
Get up. Come on.

1238
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:45,509
Get up.

1239
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,761
Get up!

1240
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:01,984
Scott, I've been bitten!

1241
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:03,944
- I've been bitten.
- No, you haven't.

1242
01:14:04,153 --> 01:14:05,445
No, you haven't. I saw it.

1243
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,114
I was bitten!

1244
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:10,367
Angie, Angie, they didn't get
you. You didn't get bitten.

1245
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:12,494
- Come on, Angie. Angie.
- I was bitten!

1246
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:14,913
- Look at me, Angie. Come on, baby.
- No!

1247
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,749
- Baby, come on, look at me.
- Man, let's go.

1248
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,626
- Get off me. Look at me.
- No.

1249
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:20,961
Let's get out of here.

1250
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,754
You did not get bit.

1251
01:14:22,963 --> 01:14:24,590
You did not get
bit. Look at me.

1252
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:25,924
You did not get bit.

1253
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:27,384
Trust me. You did not.

1254
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,303
- I saw it, I saw it.
- We have to go.

1255
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:31,138
- Let's go.
- No. Let's go, baby.

1256
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:34,391
Come on. Come on! Let's go.

1257
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:50,908
This is 3B right
here. Right here.

1258
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,164
All clear.

1259
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:04,004
- Keep the light on my hands, Scott.
- Okay.

1260
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:06,340
- Find them.
- I don't see it, I don't see.

1261
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:10,677
- The light, the light, the light.
- I'm bringing it back to you.

1262
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,262
Nothing.

1263
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:13,806
I don't...

1264
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:15,891
No, no, he wouldn't
leave them in there.

1265
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,893
Hey, he wouldn't
leave them in there.

1266
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,228
Come on.

1267
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,938
Hurry.

1268
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:22,231
Find the keys.

1269
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:24,274
He's the one
that- Who's-?

1270
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:26,610
Go back to the desk.

1271
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:29,613
- Yeah.
- Find them keys, baby.

1272
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:37,704
Come on.

1273
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,624
I got them, but I don't
know which one it is.

1274
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:42,251
- I don't know.
- Take them all.

1275
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:44,378
- Which one is it, Scott?
- Take them all.

1276
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:46,004
Come on.

1277
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:52,094
Angela, Angela, I
need you to be quiet.

1278
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:55,764
We need to get three flights of
stairs down to the basement, okay?

1279
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:58,016
I need you to stay tight.

1280
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:00,853
I need you to stay close
and stay fast, okay?

1281
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:03,814
- Are you ready? All right, all right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1282
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:05,315
- Ready, Scott?
- Yeah, yeah.

1283
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,484
All right, all right.

1284
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:10,779
Okay. All right.

1285
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:12,781
- All right, we can do this.
- Got it.

1286
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,825
- We can do this, right, Angela?
- Yeah.

1287
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,660
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1288
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:18,370
Come on.

1289
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,873
Ready. Come on.

1290
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,375
Scott, come on.
Come on, Scott.

1291
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:33,927
Angela, Angela, stop.

1292
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:36,013
Hey, we gotta go up. Come on.

1293
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:39,308
Come on, run, run.

1294
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:43,729
Get up there. Come on.

1295
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:48,192
Up. Go.

1296
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:53,197
- Gonna be an old one. Oh, God.
- Go.

1297
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:56,533
- It's gotta be an old one, Scott.
- I know, pick the key.

1298
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,452
- Get in there.
- Light, light, light!

1299
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,746
- I'm finding it, I'm finding it!
- Come on.

1300
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,706
- Go, go, go.
- Scott, I got it.

1301
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:06,919
- Go, go, go.
- I got it!

1302
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:16,178
- Lock it.
- I can't get it.

1303
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:23,060
- Come on.
- I can't get it.

1304
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:25,354
Scott, I can't!

1305
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,189
Just turn the light on.

1306
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:29,733
- Turn the light on.
- It'll come back on.

1307
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,027
- I need the light on!
- It will come back on.

1308
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:33,320
Oh, please.

1309
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:37,866
There we go, there we go,
there we go. Okay? Okay, listen.

1310
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,369
Listen, listen.
They went away.

1311
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:44,164
I think they went
away. Oh, damn, damn.

1312
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,250
Okay, so this
place was locked up.

1313
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:50,045
What that means, probably, is
there ain't nobody in here. No one.

1314
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:52,673
Yeah, let's find a way out.

1315
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,843
Oh, God. Come on.

1316
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:59,596
Oh, what is this place, Scott?

1317
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,281
- Oh, please, keep the light on.
- I got you, I got you.

1318
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:21,577
What is this?

1319
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:31,211
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1320
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:32,713
Come on.

1321
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:35,549
Come on. Come on, now.

1322
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,094
- What is this?
- Oh, please.

1323
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:44,016
- What is this?
- I don't know, man.

1324
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:45,350
What is it?

1325
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:46,810
- Oh, what is that?
- Please.

1326
01:18:46,977 --> 01:18:48,562
What is it?

1327
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:53,525
What the hell?

1328
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:00,657
Oh, shit.

1329
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:03,285
Oh, God. Oh, it's all
the same kind of stuff.

1330
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:05,078
I don't understand it.

1331
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,080
Just stop.

1332
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:08,874
Wait.

1333
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,543
Oh, God, let's get
out of here, please.

1334
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,587
Okay, come on. Come
on, grab my hand.

1335
01:19:13,754 --> 01:19:16,507
Grab my hand, it's me, it's
me. Look at it, look at it.

1336
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:18,634
Just come around this
pole. Let me lead.

1337
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:20,385
Let me lead. I'm
right with you.

1338
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:22,304
That's the way,
okay? Okay, come on.

1339
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:24,598
Oh, God, I don't-

1340
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:27,810
Hey, hey, my bad, my bad.

1341
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:29,520
Okay.

1342
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:31,396
Angela?

1343
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:35,192
We're gonna have to
go through that door.

1344
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:43,575
I just need you to open it.

1345
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:45,452
You're gonna let
me look in first.

1346
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:47,996
- You just open it, okay?
- Yeah.

1347
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:50,123
Just push it and stand back.

1348
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:53,210
Stand back. Okay, okay.

1349
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:56,255
Come on, come on, Angie.
Angie, let's go in there.

1350
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:59,299
- Please, get the light on me, okay?
- Come on.

1351
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:03,053
Oh, this is so
fucked. I don't know.

1352
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,180
Oh, damn.

1353
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:11,061
Oh, shit, stick with me,
stick with me. Come on.

1354
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,357
Okay?

1355
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:19,444
- Keep the light on, keep the light on.
- What is it?

1356
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:21,947
Okay.

1357
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:25,951
Okay, good? You gotta-

1358
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:27,744
Shit.

1359
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,080
- What is this?
- What?

1360
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:33,417
What is it? What the hell?

1361
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:36,044
What are you doing?

1362
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:39,339
- Oh, Scott, what is this stuff?
- Okay.

1363
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:43,260
Okay.

1364
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,430
Who is this? Who is this?

1365
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:48,015
Oh, what is that?

1366
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:51,393
Is that a fucking...?

1367
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:53,395
Hey, play it.

1368
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,900
I don't know what
to do with it.

1369
01:20:58,108 --> 01:20:59,651
That's it, come on.

1370
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:12,164
Hey, what is that?

1371
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:44,530
What was that?

1372
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,245
I'll come to you.

1373
01:21:51,411 --> 01:21:53,163
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1374
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,332
Hey, hey, hey.

1375
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,460
Come on. We don't
know what's up there.

1376
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:06,677
- Grab my hand, grab my hand.
- Okay.

1377
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,888
Okay.

1378
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:14,101
Okay, I'm gonna
take the camera.

1379
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:17,271
Listen to me, listen to me.
I'm gonna take the camera.

1380
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:19,481
- I'm gonna take a look up there.
- No, no.

1381
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,150
- Get up the door.
- No, no, no.

1382
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:24,111
We can't stay the fuck down
here. We can't stay here.

1383
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:26,655
I won't have a light
if you go up there!

1384
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:29,408
- Angie, Angie, stay with me.
- I'll be in the dark!

1385
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:31,410
Angie, stay with me!

1386
01:22:31,577 --> 01:22:33,287
Angie, stay with me!

1387
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:36,707
Look, I'm gonna have to
take this light off you.

1388
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:39,918
Here, grab my waist.
Okay, just grab my waist.

1389
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:41,712
Good.

1390
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:10,032
Scott, what happened?
What happened?

1391
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,160
- Oh, something hit the camera.
- Don't turn it off, fix it.

1392
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:15,704
- I'm trying. Damn it, I'm trying.
- Please!

1393
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:16,955
I'm trying.

1394
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:19,416
Look, I'm gonna put
the night vision on.

1395
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,419
I'll put the night
vision on. Hold on.

1396
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:24,588
Just stay there, okay?

1397
01:23:24,755 --> 01:23:27,007
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

1398
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,134
Okay.

1399
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:31,637
Okay. Okay, I can
see you now, okay?

1400
01:23:31,845 --> 01:23:33,305
Okay.

1401
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:36,767
All right? Okay.

1402
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:40,729
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm gonna
stick my hand out, okay?

1403
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:42,856
Okay, okay. Hey.

1404
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:44,775
Relax, relax, it's me.

1405
01:23:44,942 --> 01:23:46,985
Hey, it's me, it's
me, it's me, okay?

1406
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,613
Okay, good. Come on, come on.

1407
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,532
Hey, you're doing
good. Come around.

1408
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:53,492
Come around my back. Hold on.

1409
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,160
Hold on. We'll be okay, okay?

1410
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:58,455
I just gotta find
us a way out of here.

1411
01:23:58,664 --> 01:24:00,207
Okay? Okay.

1412
01:24:00,415 --> 01:24:02,918
I'll find a way
out, I promise.

1413
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,674
Just give me a minute.

1414
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:12,845
What's that? Stay
still, stay still.

1415
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,429
Why? Why? Why?

1416
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:16,640
Get down. Get down.

1417
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:19,726
Don't make a sound.
Don't make a sound.

1418
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:49,149
It can't see us.

1419
01:25:49,316 --> 01:25:53,570
If it can't hear
us, it won't find us.

1420
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:08,335
Okay, get ready. We're
gonna try to get by it.

1421
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,058
Run!

1422
01:26:24,143 --> 01:26:27,104
Run!

1423
01:27:48,894 --> 01:27:50,771
Scott!
