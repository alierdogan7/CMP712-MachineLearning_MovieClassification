[train horn]

2
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,268
[intercom] Due to a computer error,
the food stamp program

3
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,687
has been suspended
until further notice.

4
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,898
Please do not apply at this time.

5
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,360
All applicants' report wages
will now report to window P.

6
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,570
Thank you.

7
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,700
Last place of employment?

8
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,119
Denver, Colorado.

9
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,205
Worked there for ten years.

10
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,624
Then things just seemed to dry up.

11
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,294
They lost fourteen banks in one week.

12
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,926
So, well...

13
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,263
There's nothing available
for you right now.

14
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,026
[man] They use
their tongues to deceive.

15
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,196
The venom of snakes is
under their lips.

16
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,074
Their mouths are full
of bitterness and curses.

17
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,744
And in their paths,
nothing but ruin and misery.

18
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:10,082
And the fear of God is not
before their eyes.

19
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:15,462
They have taken the hearts
and minds of our leaders.

20
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,298
They have recruited
the rich and the powerful.

21
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,760
And they have blinded us to the truth.

22
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,389
Our human spirit is corrupted.

23
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,016
Why do we worship greed?

24
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:32,604
Because outside
the limit of our sight,

25
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,066
feeding off us,
perched on top of us

26
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:41,405
from birth to death
are our owners-- our owners!

27
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,698
They have us!

28
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,241
They control us!

29
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,576
They are our masters!

30
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,578
Wake up, they're all about you.

31
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,038
All around you.

32
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,983
[woman] Sometimes, when I watch TV,

33
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,110
I stop being myself.

34
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,738
I'm a star of a series or a--

35
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,448
or I have my own talk show

36
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,159
or I'm on the news
getting out of a limo

37
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,660
going some place important.

38
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,830
All I ever have to do is be famous.

39
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,625
People watch me and they love me.

40
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,048
And I never, never grow old.

41
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,508
And I never die.

42
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,779
Excuse me.

43
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,364
You need anybody?

44
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,575
Maybe.

45
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,577
I got my own tools.

46
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,997
Well, this is a union job.

47
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,592
So, then may I please speak
with the shop steward?

48
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,845
Sir?

49
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,426
Hey, there's no sleeping
on this site.

50
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,220
So you park your ass
someplace else tonight.

51
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,097
Excuse me.

52
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,474
Then when do I get paid?

53
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,268
Thursday.

54
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,991
You need a place to stay?

55
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,036
Justiceville's over on Fourth Street.

56
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,371
They got hot food and showers.

57
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,707
I'm going that way
if you want me to show you.

58
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,740
I don't like nobody following me
'less I know why.

59
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,409
Well, I don't join up with anybody

60
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,161
until I see where he's going.

61
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,395
They're serving the food up soon.

62
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,273
Good, I'm starving.

63
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,359
Whoa.

64
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,195
Hey, throw the ball.

65
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,030
Hey, Frank, how's it going?

66
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,078
Now you get a chance to meet
some of the folk.

67
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,454
This here's Gilbert.

68
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,623
Anything you need,
he knows where to find it.

69
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,832
Hi.

70
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,167
Howdy.

71
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,044
What do you got in that pack, tools?

72
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,379
Yes, sir.

73
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,298
Well, if you can use them
we can use you.

74
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,300
Shower's caving in over there.

75
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,344
Let's get something to eat.

76
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,733
There you go.

77
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,820
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

78
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,613
- Want some peas?
- Yeah, please.

79
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,616
- Thanks.
- Some more?

80
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,118
Yes.

81
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,706
Peas?

82
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,462
I got a wife and two kids
back in Detroit.

83
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,633
Haven't seen them in six months.

84
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,722
Steel mills were
laying people off left and right.

85
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,808
They finally went under.

86
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,896
We gave the steel companies
a break when they needed it.

87
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,648
Know what they gave themselves?

88
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,400
Raises.

89
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,946
The golden rule--

90
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,116
He who has the gold makes the rules.

91
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,747
They close one more factory,

92
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,875
we should take a sledge to one
of their fancy, fucking foreign cars.

93
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,754
You know, you ought to have
a little more patience with life.

94
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,963
Yeah, well I'm all out.

95
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,760
The whole deal is like
some kind of crazy game.

96
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,639
They put you at the starting line,

97
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,933
the name of the game is,
"Make it through life."

98
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,810
Only, everyone's out for themselves

99
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,604
and looking to do you in
at the same time.

100
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,731
Okay, man, here we are.

101
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,525
Here we are--
now, you do what you can.

102
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,986
But remember,
I'm going to do my best

103
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,030
to blow your ass away.

104
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,621
So, how you going to make it?

105
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,916
I deliver a hard day's work
for my money.

106
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,584
I just want the chance,
it'll come.

107
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,920
I believe in America.

108
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,129
I follow the rules.

109
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,093
Everybody's got their own
hard times these days.

110
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,057
[blues harmonica]

111
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,495
You've always thought
you couldn't wear

112
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,665
press-on nails because of all
the active things you do?

113
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,710
Well, if you're ready for beautiful,

114
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,004
natural looking, easy to apply nails,

115
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,424
three colors in seven luscious hues,

116
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,051
just-- [static]

117
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,471
Our impulses are being redirected.

118
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,892
We are living in an artificially
induced state of consciousness

119
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,310
that resembles sleep.

120
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,398
Goddamn hacker, that's the second time
tonight that asshole's cut in.

121
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,610
The movement was begun
eight months ago

122
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,781
by a small group of scientists
who discovered quite by accident

123
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,534
these signals being sent through--
[static]

124
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,330
Thing's giving me a headache.

125
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,957
Yeah, tell me about it.

126
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,918
Must took the hacker's months
to figure out how to do this.

127
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,131
The poor and the underclass
are growing.

128
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,885
Racial justice and human rights
are non-existent.

129
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,847
They have created
a repressive society

130
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:51,311
and we are their unwitting accomplices.

131
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,189
Their intention to rule rests

132
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,858
with the annihilation
of consciousness.

133
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,486
We have been lulled into a trance.

134
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:04,032
They have made us
indifferent to ourselves, to others.

135
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,243
We are focused only on our own gain.

136
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,246
We ha--

137
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:22,425
Please understand, they are safe
as long as they are not discovered.

138
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,386
That is their primary
method of survival.

139
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:29,849
Keep us asleep, keep us selfish,
keep us sedated.

140
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,559
...they're pulling the water
out of the sand like sponges.

141
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,019
Blow it out your ass.

142
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,025
Choir practice went
a little late last night, didn't it?

143
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,737
Oh, the church lets us use
their kitchen.

144
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,282
Until four in the morning?

145
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,993
Hey, we're taking care
of a lot of people here.

146
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:26,007
They are dismantling
the sleeping middle class.

147
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,469
More and more people are becoming poor.

148
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,095
We are their cattle.

149
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,681
We are being bred for slavery.

150
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,350
The revo--

151
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,977
Not again.

152
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,646
We cannot break their signal.

153
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,523
Our transmitter is not powerful enough.

154
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,319
The signal must be shut off
at the source.

155
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,071
We have--

156
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,906
Danny, I have a headache.

157
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,616
Me too, honey.

158
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,373
Can somebody please explain to me
what the hell that's all about?

159
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,583
Just that idiot licking his nuts again.

160
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,723
[choir singing "Rock of Ages"]

161
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,803
[singing continues]

162
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,236
I just checked the connection

163
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,113
and there's nothing wrong with it.

164
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,116
[choir louder, continues]

165
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,910
We have to face facts.

166
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,995
Only a few seconds got on the air.

167
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,332
It's time to forget about breaking in
on top of their signal.

168
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,459
They're only going to jam us out
again and again.

169
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,295
Then we have to send
the shipment out on the street.

170
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,714
No, no, no, that's not
going to work that way.

171
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,007
We've been all through this.

172
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,344
We have no other choice.

173
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,396
Robbing banks,
manufacturing Hoffman lenses

174
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,981
until we're blue in the face.

175
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,983
We're just not going to reach
enough people!

176
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,662
We've got to find new people,
strong people-- people to work with us.

177
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,938
That's my baby.

178
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,194
Just leaving--
you know, your door was open.

179
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,321
Just wanted to close it--
didn't want no one breaking in.

00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,365

181
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,492
Yeah, well, let me touch your face.

182
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,162
- Mmm, it's good.
- That's fine.

183
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,621
Now your hands.

184
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,956
- That's fine.
- Good.

185
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,500
- Eh, you're a working man.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,044
Here, it's the revolution.

187
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,504
Let me show you.

188
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,464
I got to be going right now.

189
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,300
Maybe some other time, huh?

190
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,593
Huh?

191
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,845
This world may have blinded me,

192
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,973
but the Lord has let me see.

193
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,892
You'll be back.

194
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,269
You'll be back!

195
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,245
I've been hearing something
on the streets

196
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,206
the last couple of weeks.

197
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,082
Weird stuff.

198
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,584
Some sort of epidemic of violence

199
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,419
what they've been saying.

200
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,338
I was talking to one old boy,

201
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,673
he's from San Anselmo.

202
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,509
He told me they got
some sort of cult up there.

203
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,888
End of the world kind of stuff.

204
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,279
Well, what are they doing?

205
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,241
You know, shooting people,
robbing banks.

206
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,910
Same old thing as always.

207
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:50,998
Whole lot of people gone crazy
over some nutty dream they just had.

208
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,461
You want to know the truth?

209
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,089
This kind of shit happens
the end of every century.

210
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,634
It does-- it's just people
afraid to face the future.

211
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,052
It's all it is.

212
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,022
Hey, what's happening?

213
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,732
I was inside there a while.

214
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,611
All kinds of cardboard boxes,
some kind of lab set.

215
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,114
What do you mean?

216
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,532
There's no singing.

217
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,783
It's a tape recorder.

218
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,413
Leave it alone, man.

219
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,747
It ain't none of my business,

220
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,499
ain't none of yours.

221
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,294
Yeah, but our boy, Gilbert's
in there helping them.

222
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,843
Look, I got a job now.

223
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,386
And I plan on keeping it.

224
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,097
I'm walking a white line all the time.

225
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,266
I don't bother nobody,
nobody bothers me.

226
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,310
You better start doing the same.

227
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,570
White line's in the middle of the road.

228
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,782
It's the worst place to drive.

229
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:15,583
I'll see you later.

230
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,464
Step down.

231
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,799
Watch it.

232
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,634
Easy, easy, this way.

233
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,391
All right, now we're going
to cross the road.

234
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,767
It's dirt here.

235
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,188
[sirens blare]

236
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,694
Quickly, quickly!

237
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,102
- Go, go!
- Come on, this way-- this way.

238
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,497
Frank!

239
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,752
We know who you are.

240
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,546
Leave us alone!

241
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,425
We know you!

242
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,095
Don't hurt him either.

243
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,686
God help me!

244
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,773
Though I walk through the valley

245
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,109
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.

246
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,528
Thy rod and Thy staff will--

247
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,957
Jesus! Jesus!

248
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,465
[groaning]

249
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,190
Come on!

250
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,369
Come on in and join the party, man.

251
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,122
You go with them.

252
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,673
[helicopter blades whir]

253
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:47,182
[sirens]

254
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,060
Somebody start World War III?

255
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,173
Oman's collection puts passion
before fashion.

256
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,800
Dash and trash are back.

257
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:26,388
Out goes glitter
and in comes divine excess.

258
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,100
The fall collection revels
in freedom of expression.

259
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,352
Gay abandon rushes to meet

260
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,855
the roaring '90s.

261
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,823
What's your problem?

262
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,372
I said, what's your problem?

263
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,591
How are you today, sir?

264
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,426
- Okay, how's it going?
- Fine, thank you.

265
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,263
Thank you, sir.

266
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,438
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.

267
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,500
Hey, buddy,

268
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,710
you going to pay for that or what?

269
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,844
Look, buddy,
I don't want no hassle today.

270
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,846
Either pay for it or put it back.

271
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,855
Huh.

272
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:55,277
[male voice]
Sleep, sleep, sleep...

273
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,766
Can you believe it?

274
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,144
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.

275
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,731
I told her,
for yourself and for the baby,

276
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,357
go!

277
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,978
Did Bob make you go
to John and Mary Ellen's last night?

278
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,106
I was shocked,
she served blue corn tortillas.

279
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,566
It's so dated.

280
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,276
[both laugh]

281
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,619
So depressed,
I don't know what to do.

282
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,120
Hey, go for it, man.

283
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,165
It's easy for you to say,
you got the promotion.

284
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,501
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.

285
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,129
The feeling is definitely there.

286
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,590
It's a new morning in America--

287
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,425
fresh, vital.

288
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,970
The old cynicism is gone.

289
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,347
We have faith in our leaders.

290
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,809
We're optimistic
as to what becomes of it all.

291
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,438
It really boils down
to our ability to accept.

292
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,357
We don't need pessimism.

293
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,442
There are no limits.

294
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,903
It figures it would be
something like this.

295
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,407
Uh.

296
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,701
Excuse me.

297
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,997
You know, you look like your head
fell in the cheese dip

298
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,999
back in 1957.

299
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,213
You, you're okay.

300
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,757
This one, real fucking ugly.

301
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,634
Oh.

302
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,094
You see, I take these glasses off,

303
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,555
she looks like a regular person,
doesn't she, huh?

304
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,975
Put them back on, formaldehyde face--
That's what we got.

305
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,643
That's enough out of you.

306
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,103
Get out or I call the cops.

307
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,188
Call the cops,
you know what you need?

308
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,190
You need a Brazilian
plastic surgeon, that--

309
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,445
I've got one that can see.

310
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,870
[mumbling into their watches]

311
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,373
He's a tall Caucasian male,

312
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,585
doesn't appear armed,
wearing sunglasses.

313
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,296
I don't like this one bit.

314
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,467
Not one bit.

315
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,555
[car honking]

316
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,450
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.

317
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,749
All right, suppose we settle down?

318
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,584
That's far enough.

319
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,586
Where'd you get those glasses?

320
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,713
Tooth fairy.

321
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,632
I'll bet.

322
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,676
We got him.

323
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,845
Nick yourself shaving this morning?

324
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,682
You look as shitty to us
as we do to you.

325
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,186
Impossible.

326
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,523
It would be easier if we don't have
to splatter your brains.

327
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,527
Just take it easy.

328
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,529
Now, you stumbled onto something here.

329
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,615
Maybe we can all benefit
from this slight misunderstanding.

330
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,661
Now, let's go someplace quiet

331
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,579
so we can talk this over.

332
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,687
So you bastards die
just like we do.

333
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,584
[siren wails]

334
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,681
[gasps]

335
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,573
I have come here
to chew bubble gum

336
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,825
and kick ass.

337
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,580
And I'm all out of bubble gum.

338
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,430
Near the entrance.

339
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,182
Has a shotgun.

340
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,685
White male, 30s, long hair.

341
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,313
Mama don't like tattletales.

342

Wearing sunglasses.

343
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,427
And who are you, little fella?

344
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,057
Come to show them where I am.

345
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,644
Not nice.

346
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,529
Drop it!

347
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,032
I said drop it!

348
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,917
Beat your feet.

349
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,577
[tires screech]

350
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,914
Take it easy.

351
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,751
Just want a little ride out of here.

352
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,882
Close the door.

353
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,601
Drive.

354
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,439
Not too fast.

355
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,550
They're gone.

356
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,101
Just keep driving.

357
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,353
Where am I going?

358
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,105
You married?

359
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,940
Yes.

360
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,069
Please don't lie to me.

361
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,530
No.

362
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,534
Live alone?

363
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,913
[sighs]
Your place.

364
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,082
I'd rather not do that.

365
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,835
I'm afraid I must insist.

366
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,105
[dog barks]

367
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,037
Hi, Holly.

368
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,794
Hmph.

369
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:27,116
Look, I don't know what you want.

370
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,160
Oh, just quiet.

371
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,997
Whoo.

372
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,499
It's like a drug.

373
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,045
Wearing these glasses makes you high,
but, oh, you come down hard.

374
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:43,883
Now look, things turned out
a little sour for me today.

375
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,843
You're not the only one.

376
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,137
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

377
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,139
But I needed you to get away.

378
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,728
No, you have two guns.

379
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,021
You're not sorry.

380
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,233
You're in charge.

381
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,112
Look lady, we're in trouble.

382
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,697
The whole world's in trouble.

383
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,241
They're all around us
and we never knew it.

384
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,159
You can only see them
with these special glasses.

385
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,703
I swear to you we're being controlled
by these things!

386
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,622
I don't know what they are
or where they came from,

387
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,332
but we got to stop them!
- All right.

388
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,875
I'll do whatever you want

389
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,294
whenever you want.

390
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,714
Just don't hurt me, please.

391
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,175
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

392
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,718
Okay.

393
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,557
You're fighting the forces of evil

394
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,310
that none of us can see
without sunglasses.

395
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,107
Take a look.

396
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,609
If you want me to look
through your sunglasses,

397
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,069
I'll look through your sunglasses.

398
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,946
If I don't see what you see,

399
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,240
I'm going to see it anyway.

400
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:57,081
Yeah, you have it your way, huh?

401
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,917
It's not my way.

402
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,879
It's your way.

403
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,922
Don't fuck with me.

404
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,592
I'm thirsty.

405
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,848
Go ahead.

406
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,246
Look, uh,

407
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,625
I'm sorry I have to be here, huh?

408
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,634
[pours wine]

409
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,391
So, your name's Holly, right?

410
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,061
Holly Thompson.

411
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,857
It's a pretty name.

412
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,068
So what do you do?

413
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,448
Assistant program director,

414
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,659
Cable 54.

415
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,786
A TV station?

416
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,663
Yes.

417
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,416
They're sending some kind
of signals out of TV sets.

418
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,807
No, no.

419
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,226
I'm all right.

420
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,070
Holly Thompson,

421
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,323
8634 Circleview Drive.

422
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,799
Yes, I'll hold.

423
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:06,270
[sirens approach]

424
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,794
Frank, we're ready when you are.

425
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,593
Frank.

426
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,680
Don't let nobody see you.

427
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,893
I've had a rough couple of days.

428
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,270
I don't want nothing to do with you.

429
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,771
How many people did you kill?

430
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,773
Not people.

431
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,067
You crazy son of a bitch!

432
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,195
- I got to show you something.
- No, you ain't showing me nothing!

433
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,238
I got a wife and kids.

434
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,698
So, leave me alone.

435
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,162
Get out of here.

436
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,902
[trash men argue]

437
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,407
Watch this.

438
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,829
Oh, no.

439
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,989
Yo.

440
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,450
One week's pay.

441
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,037
It's the best I could do.

442
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,084
Wait!

443
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,296
Hey, you better find yourself
someplace to hide

444
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,298
and keep praying
nobody ever finds you.

445
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,632
Try these on.

446
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,384
Look, you crazy mother,

447
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,803
- Put these on.
- Hey, stay away from me!

448
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,930
I'm telling you,
you dumb son of a bitch--

449
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:02,149
I'm trying to save you
and your family's life.

450
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,109
You couldn't even save your own.

451
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,491
I'm giving you a choice.

452
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,035
Either put on these glasses

453
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,079
or start eating that trash can.

454
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,040
Not this year.

455
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,833
Okay.

456
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,753
All right.

457
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,172
- Okay.
- Come on.

458
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,840
Come on.

459
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,112
I don't want to fight you.

460
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,197
- Come on!
- I don't want to fight you.

461
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,490
- Stop it!
- No!

462
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,783
Fuck!

463
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,286
Shit!

464
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,663
Put on the glasses.

465
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,309
Man, I told you,

466
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,894
I didn't want to be in--

467
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,654
You dirty motherfucker.

468
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,546
Take a look.

469
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,965
Put 'em on.

470
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,181
No!

471
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,095
Shit.

472
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,781
Oh, man, I'm sorry, man.

473
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,074
You f--

474
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,742
Fuck!

475
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,718
Put the glasses on!

476
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,636
Put 'em on!

477
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,785
Fuck you.

478
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,886
Look.

479
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,888
Look at them, they're everywhere.

480
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,432
Maybe they can see.
Alley Fifth and Spring.

481
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,811
Now hold on.

482
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,814
You ain't the first son of a bitch
to wake up out of their dream.

483
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,232
[rumble]

484
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,692
What's that?

485
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:48,078
Brother, life's a bitch.

486
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,498
And she's back in heat.

487
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,556
[police siren]

488
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,998
I want a room.

489
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,548
Ain't love grand?

490
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,405
Don't wear them glasses too long.

491
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:51,076
Starts to feel like a knife
turning in your skull.

492
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,251
How long have they been there?

493
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,127
Who knows.

494
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,339
What are they,
where do they come from?

495
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,883
Well, they ain't from Cleveland.

496
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,718
Look, man, I don't need
that kind of shit!

497
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,428
What are we going to do?

498
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,807
We're going to wait.

499
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,267
Wait wait for what?

500
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,519
You know, that really answers
my fucking question.

501
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,021
Well, when you get
some kind of master plan

502
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,690
you let me know, huh?

503
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,117
We can't be the only
ones who can see.

504
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,246
We got to find the people
who made these.

505
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:40,208
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.

506
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,687
A long time ago

507
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,356
things were different, man.

508
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:07,152
My own daddy
took me down to the river,

509
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:11,907
kicked my ass, told me
about the power and the glory.

510
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,992
I was saved.

511
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,120
He changed when I was little.

512
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,916
Turned mean.

513
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,751
Started tearing at me.

514
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,671
So I ran away when I was 13.

515
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:32,010
Tried to cut me, once.

516
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,889
Big old razor blade.

517
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,642
Held it up against my throat.

518
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,937
I said, "Daddy, please."

519
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:47,317
Just kept moving back and forth.

520
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,904
Like he was sawing down a little tree.

521
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,244
Maybe they've always been with us.

522
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:00,121
Those things out there.

523
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,375
Maybe they love it.

524
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,294
Seeing us hate each other.

525
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,464
Watching us kill each other off.

526
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,258
Feeding on our own
cold fucking hearts.

527
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,264
I got news for 'em.

528
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,685
Going to be hell to pay.

529
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,690
Because I ain't
Daddy's little boy no more.

530
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,259
Frank?

531
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,816
There's a meeting tonight.

532
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,443
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.

533
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,611
Watch out no one follows you.

534
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,031
[spins and clicks gun cylinder]

535
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,117
World needs a wake-up call.

536
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:23,997
We're going to phone it in.

537
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,101
Hey, brothers.

538
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,856
There's something new going down.

539
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,512
They're using candy floss packages.

540
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,972
It's like building a park
for a toxic waste dump.

541
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,474
They colorized it.

542
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,186
Here's a list of safe houses.

543
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,563
You're going to memorize it
and then destroy the paper.

544
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,981
What's a safe house?

545
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,983
What kind of gun is that?

546
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,820
Hey, Frank.

547
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,988
- Hey.
- Hey, glad you made it.

548
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,907
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.

549
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,408
We're all human in here.

550
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:50,875
Memorize these safe houses.

551
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,003
Brand new.

552
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,755
Got the first shipment today.

553
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,509
They won't hurt.

554
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,594
There's less interference.

555
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,430
Go ahead.

556
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:19,487
There is a signal broadcast
every second of every day

557
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,281
through our television sets.

558
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,491
Even when the set is turned off.

559
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,077
- The brain receives the input...
- Hey.

560
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,580
- Hi.
- You have any trouble getting here?

561
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,331
No, we made it fine.

562
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,084
Good, the city's crawling with cops
looking for us.

563
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,503
And most of the cops are human.

564
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,173
They've been told that we're commies
trying to bring down the government.

565
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,425
And some of them are being recruited.

566
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,719
Creatures are trading wealth, power.

567
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,554
You mean people
are joining up with them?

568
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,598
Most of us just sell out right away.

569
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,225
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.

570
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,269
Our bank accounts get bigger.

571
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,938
We start buying new houses, cars.

572
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,690
Perfect, isn't it?

573
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,942
We'll do anything to be rich.

574
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,695
Look around the environment we live in.

575
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,615
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons,
and methane

576
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,367
have increased since 1958.

577
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,162
Earth is being acclimatized.

578
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:13,499
They are turning our atmosphere
into their atmosphere.

579
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,835
What do these things want
and why are they here?

580
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,253
It's in our best interests.

581
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,630
They're free enterprisers.

582
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,549
The Earth is just another
developing planet.

583
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,301
Their third world.

584
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:26,304
We are like a natural resource
to them--

585
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,390
deplete the planet,
move on to another.

586
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,018
They want benign indifference.

587
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:34,145
They want us drugged.

588
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,605
We could be pets.

589
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,106
We could be food.

590
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:40,276
But all we really are is livestock.

591
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,240
Now, we need an assault unit.

592
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,533
Someone to hit them hard
when the time comes.

593
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,245
You've got it.

594
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:53,248
Ever see their disappearing act?

595
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,667
Once.

596
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,628
What's that?

597
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,214
They all wear these expensive watches.

598
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,591
Turns out they're really
two-way radios.

599
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,593
You can listen to their broadcast.

600
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,850
There's something else.

601
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,853
Some kind of secret code
or hidden control.

602
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,898
They push a button
and then all of a sudden-- bang!

603
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,110
They're gone.

604
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,861
I've been trying to figure it out.

605
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,947
All right, now everybody listen up.

606
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,533
Now, we're obviously not getting
to enough people

607
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,243
because look at our numbers tonight.

608
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,453
There should be twice
as many of us here.

609
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,456
We're getting too sloppy,
that's all there is to it.

610
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,001
Now, their detection

611
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,211
is becoming more effective.

612
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,505
So we have to be more careful.

613
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:45,466
Stay aware of keeping up appearances.

614
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,427
Go to work, punch your time clocks.

615
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:49,220
Do what's expected of you.

616
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,847
We've gotten reckless.

617
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,057
And the movement's suffering for it.

618
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,726
Time to stop talking about it

619
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,769
trying to figure out how it happened.

620
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,522
Now we start spilling some blood!

621
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,524
[group clamors]

622
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:03,568
Wait a minute, it's not working!

623
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,822
We don't stand a chance
with a few guns and grenades.

624
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,574
So what are we supposed to do?

625
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,993
We bide our time.

626
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,413
We seek out and locate their signal
and shut it off!

627
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,040
Wake people up!

628
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,293
Now, Dave here works at KRDA.

629
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:24,630
He claims that the signal
may be coming from one place.

630
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,090
KRDA is clear.

631
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,136
The transmission is going out clean.

632
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,430
The signal is coming
from somewhere else.

633
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,641
How does she know?

634
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:38,436
[crowd grumbles]

635
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,521
All right, this is the point.

636
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,608
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal's coming from.

637
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,777
And the only way we can do--

638
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,362
I got to go talk to someone.

639
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,823
If you're approached by anyone
to work for these creatures,

640
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,658
by all means accept.

641
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,243
Gain their trust.

642
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:56,662
Make them believe
they can buy you off.

643
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,378
Are you okay?

644
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:07,423
Yeah, I'm okay.

645
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,510
I thought I'd killed you.

646
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,845
I thought so too.

647
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,101
I didn't know.

648
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,104
I'm so sorry.

649
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,449
Look, I just want to--

650
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,452
Can we just--

651
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,709
Get out!

652
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:46,170
[continuous gun fire]

653
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:38,306
[siren wails]

654
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:36,989
- They're killing everybody.
- I got to find her.

655
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,242
- Wait a minute, man, are you crazy?
- I got to see if she's all right.

656
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,701
Just stay back!

657
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,370
There's nothing you can do out there.

658
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,961
If I can get this thing working,
we can listen in.

659
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,513
- Frank,
- What?

660
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,265
- Frank,
- What!

661
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,933
- Get set to shoot.
- Oh, shit!

662
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,398
[loud rumble]

663
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,732
- What was that?
- I don't know.

664
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:20,908
[woman's voice] Attention,
your wristwatch has malfunctioned.

665
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,245
This entryway is temporary
and will disappear in ten seconds.

666
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,663
- Get in there.
- What?

667
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:26,914
- Move.
- I don't know what's down there.

668
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,666
- Now!
- Oh, shit.

669
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,334
[woman's voice]
Seven seconds.

670
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,086
Six seconds.

671
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,879
Five seconds.

672
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,298
Four seconds.

673
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,674
Three seconds.

674
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,092
Two seconds.

675
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,635
One second.

676
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:46,475
[intercom] If you need assistance
in finding your destination,

677
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:50,396
bilingual instructions are posted
at the end of each corridor.

678
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:55,359
What language is that?

679
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,736
I don't know.

680
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,904
Where the hell are we?

681
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:02,199
I think we're under the city.

682
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,118
Maybe some kind
of underground base or something.

683
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:08,039
There got to be a way out.

684
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,499
I just hope that nobody
saw us dropping in.

685
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:20,885
[radio] Operation Steel Fist
has been a complete success.

686
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,220
All security stations stand down
to operational--

687
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,513
Right.

688
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,307
- We have eliminated the terrorists.
- Okay.

689
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,477
We got 'em, we wiped them out!

690
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,646
It's a win, man.

691
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,689
They got to meet the A-team.

692
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,575
[distant applause]

693
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,535
I'm hearing something.

694
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,335
[applause closer]

695
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:07,181
Our projections show
that by the year 2025,

696
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,434
not only America,
but the entire planet

697
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:13,062
will be under the protection
and the dominion

698
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,897
of this power alliance.

699
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,108
The gains have been substantial,

700
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,902
both for ourselves and for you,

701
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,196
the human power elite.

702
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,876
You have given us entrée
to the resources we need

703
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,879
in our ongoing quest for
multidimensional expansion.

704
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,633
And in return, the per capita income
of each of you here tonight

705
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:47,680
has grown, in this year alone,
by an average 39o/o.

706
01:18:56,481 --> 01:19:00,568
And I've just received word that
our forces have won a major victory.

707
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:04,196
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed

708
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,656
here on the West Coast.

709
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:07,408
We are off crisis alert.

710
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,869
The situation is normal again.

711
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,455
[crowd applause and cheers]

712
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,999
How you doing boys?

713
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,584
I didn't know you'd been recruited.

714
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,169
Welcome aboard.

715
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,630
You know you boys really
should have dressed for the party

716
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,382
now you can afford it.

717
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,721
I got to tell you,
I sure am proud to be here.

718
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,389
You seen the whole place?

719
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:33,601
I haven't had a chance to yet.

720
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,811
Come on, I'll show you around.

721
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,859
You know, I knew me and you
had a lot in common

722
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,737
first time we met.

723
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,864
[speaker] Money isn't
the nicest thing in life,

724
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,908
- Hey, waiter,
- [speaker] the only thing.

725
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,868
Thank you, buddy.

726
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,413
Excuse me,

727
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,832
where the hell are we?

728
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,709
Back stage at the show, boys.

729
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,086
I'll admit it is a little funky,

730
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,797
but it serves its purpose.

731
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,883
How did you get here,
use one of these little portable jobs?

732
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,636
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em

733
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,429
except in cases of emergency,

734
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:13,182
but they're so much fun.

735
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,685
Now, you think that's something?

736
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:18,229
Take a look at this.

737
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,649
Go on, take a closer look.

738
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,275
[intercom] Attention commuters,

739
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:27,154
flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda
is now ready for boarding.

740
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,573
Please step in
to the transmission platform.

741
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:30,866
That's where they come from.

742
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,035
All carry-on luggage
must be held securely.

743
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:36,747
Thank you for waiting and we hope
you have a pleasant trip.

744
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,100
I don't know how it works exactly,
but it has to do with some sort

745
01:20:56,101 --> 01:21:01,146
of gravitational lens deal--
bending the light or some damn thing.

746
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:03,232
But you can move from place to place,

747
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,942
world to world if you want to.

748
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:08,529
You see, the whole thing works
like one big airport.

749
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,909
Boys, let me tell you,

750
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,203
they got their act together.

751
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,080
Believe you me.

752
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,301
Evening, boys.

753
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,094
Looking sharp.

754
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:34,722
Wait until you see what
I'm going to show you now.

755
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:49,111
And here we got the brains
of the whole operation.

756
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:52,031
That's where the signal goes out
from here to the satellite.

757
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,782
We bump it out all over the world.

758
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,409
Pretty fancy, huh?

759
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,536
Not too familiar with it myself.

760
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,140
Well, boys, as far as we go.

761
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:20,851
A technique called
multispectral analysis.

762
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,728
This would allow space sensors

763
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,022
to penetrate natural barriers
and camouflage--

764
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,315
Can you get us inside?

765
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,528
I've never seen the inside
of a TV studio before.

766
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:33,822
You look like the gentleman to ask.

767
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,993
Well, I guess it wouldn't be
that much problem.

768
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,745
You see them boys over there?

769
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,622
Friends of mine.

770
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:45,125
Hey, fellas, I got a couple
of my buddies here.

771
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,252
Thought I'd give them the grand tour.

772
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:48,712
Think we can go inside?

773
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,422
Be serious.

774
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:53,133
You have your authorization cards?

775
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,302
Right here.

776
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,140
Watch the door.

777
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,186
[knocks on glass]

778
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,146
Soundproof.

779
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,857
- Where's that signal?
- It's up on the roof, I think.

780
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,568
Holly works in there.

781
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,362
If she made it,
maybe we can find her.

782
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,030
Then we can go to the roof
and break that signal, man.

783
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:17,366
Wait boys, wait
you're making a big mistake.

784
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,952
You made the mistake.

785
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:22,079
No, no, you got to listen to me.

786
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,789
I thought you boys understood.

787
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,791
It's business, that's all it is.

788
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:30,671
You still don't get it, do you boys?

789
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,090
There ain't no countries anymore.

790
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,508
No more good guys.

791
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,176
They're running the whole show.

792
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,470
They own everything--
the whole goddamn planet.

793
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,139
They can do whatever they want.

794
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,808
What's wrong with having it good,
for a change.

795
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,394
And they're going to let us
have it good if we just help 'em.

796
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:46,812
They're going to leave us alone.

797
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,147
Let us make some money.

798
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,941
You can have a little taste
of that good life too.

799
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:54,153
Now I know you want it--
hell, everybody does.

800
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,072
You do it to your own kind.

801
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:58,907
What's the threat?

802
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,993
We all sell out every day.

803
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,078
Might as well be on the winning team.

804
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,916
See you, boys.

805
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,461
Let's go!

806
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,300
Is this the two minute break
or the thirty second break?

807
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,676
I think it's the thirty second break.

808
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:20,137
They dropped 12,
I guess we must be running long.

809
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,472
I think so.

810
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,106
We are experiencing
a technical difficulty.

811
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,941
What the hell's going on?

812
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:34,109
Come on.

813
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,363
[people clamoring]

814
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:52,211
Get down!

815
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:03,931
[whispers] Now what?

816
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,641
Find out where the hell we are.

817
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,978
Excuse me.

818
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:11,897
- Come on, man.
- Wait a second.

819
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,565
Do you know Holly Thompson?

820
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:14,900
Come on, man, I mean it.

821
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:18,028
Holly Thompson, assistant program
something-or-other.

822
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,822
- Where is she?
- I, I...

823
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:22,241
[intercom] Security alert--
sections delta and x-ray

824
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,243
report to the fourth floor immediately.

825
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,578
Who's Holly?

826
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,665
[scream]

827
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,625
Oh, shit.

828
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,338
Well, I hate to interrupt you folks,

829
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,882
but could someone please guide me
how to get to the roof.

830
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,175
Security.

831
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:42,094
How do I get to the roof?

832
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,595
There's an elevator through there.

833
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:45,264
Turn to your left,
it's at the end of the hall.

834
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:47,099
Thank you very much.

835
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,071
Well?

836
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:03,657
Well, there's got to be more than
one way to get up there.

837
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,079
Security 9-5-0.

838
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,372
Lock the elevators down.

839
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:11,707
They're on the move.

840
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,459
[screams]

841
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:53,081
[beeping]

842
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:55,417
I hear them on the 19th floor
above me.

843
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,668
We got you.

844
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:59,087
We're on the 21st
we'll be waiting for 'em.

845
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,140
Go, up.

846
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,028
Holly!

847
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:44,299
[alarm beeps]
- Come on, come on!

848
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,592
[intercom]
Security alert.

849
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,344
Intruders are here--
head for the roof.

850
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,429
Repeat.
Intruders--

851
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,228
Let's go!

852
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,567
[gunshot]

853
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,214
Frank,

854
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:26,091
you and Holly clear?

855
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,135
[woman]
I'm clear.

856
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,886
Are you?

857
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:36,018
Don't do it.

858
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,276
Don't interfere,
you can't win.

859
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,496
Drop your weapon.

860
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,376
Stand away from the dish

861
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:03,170
or we will open fire.

862
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,464
Come inside with me.

863
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,090
You have ten seconds.

864
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,634
Nine.

865
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:12,137
Eight.

866
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,097
Seven.

867
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,516
Six.

868
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,067
Fuck it.

869
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:02,437
The Oscar winners gave
a press conference

870
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:04,523
and "How to Buy a Sailboat" as--

871
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,441
[man]
Gloria, you look like shit.

872
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:08,276
[man] I'm out of here.
[woman] What happened?

873
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:10,070
What's wrong?

874
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:14,908
All the sex and violence on the screen
has gone too far for me.

875
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,284
I'm fed up with it.

876
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:19,579
Filmmakers like George Romero
and John Carpenter

877
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,956
have to show some restraint.

878
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,374
They're simply--

879
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,919
You're filled with lightning
when you hit the road.

880
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,715
You're feeling that V6 power
as you take control.

881
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:33,343
Nothing can stop you now.

882
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,220
You're moving on.

883
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,722
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
