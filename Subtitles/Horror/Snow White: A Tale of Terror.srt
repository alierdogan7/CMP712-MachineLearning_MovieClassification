00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,217
[Wolves growling]

2
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,352
Whoa! Easy.

3
00:01:58,657 --> 00:02:00,909
We'll be home soon, Lilliana.

4
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:32,022
Lilliana.

5
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,235
I can't breathe.

6
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:44,575
Dear God!

7
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:47,243
Karl!

8
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,369
[Karl screaming]

9
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,639
The baby.

10
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:15,226
You must save the baby.

11
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,103
She's coming.

12
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,281
Forgive me.

13
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:32,616
Forgive me.

14
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,424
[Baby crying]

15
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,312
Lilli.

16
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,439
Lilli.

17
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:16,821
Where is that child?

18
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,323
Oh, dear.

19
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,327
Lilli?

20
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:48,016
Don't play with me today, child.

21
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:52,978
I'm too old
and my backside is too easy a target.

22
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:55,688
There you are.

23
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:58,649
Your father has been asking for you.

24
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:04,529
You'll be the death of me.

25
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,322
Tell me the story, Nannau.

26
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:10,491
Put your two feet next to mine and we'll see.

27
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,535
Tell me, Nannau, please.

28
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,578
All right then.

29
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:19,205
Let me catch my breath.

30
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:24,543
One day, not so long ago...

31
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:30,090
your mother was sitting in the window...

32
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:33,426
looking out on the snow
that covered the land.

33
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:36,219
- She was sewing a cap.
- A winter cap?

34
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,554
A winter cap, yes.

35
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:43,099
And wishing for a child
to grow inside her belly.

36
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:47,561
Suddenly, she pricked her finger
with the needle...

37
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:50,187
and her blood fell into the snow.

38
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:55,400
And she looked and thought to herself,
"I would like a baby boy."

39
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,901
A little girl, Nannau.

40
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,236
[Laughing] Go on with you.
You know it better than I do.

41
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,282
A little girl with hair
as black as the ebony window frame...

42
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,867
and skin as pale as the snow...

43
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,493
and lips as red as blood.

44
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:12,827
[Nannau laughing]

45
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,203
Slow down, child.

46
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:18,038
Careful. Careful!

47
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,415
Good day.

48
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,251
- Good day.
- Good day.

49
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,419
Good day, Thomas.

50
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,299
Papa?

51
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,178
Papa?

52
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:42,890
What kind of mischief
have you been up to today?

53
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:46,267
I picked roses and irises from the garden
with Greta and Ilsa.

54
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,145
And I helped in the kitchen.

55
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,438
Did you read the scripture?

56
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,398
- Yes.
- Good.

57
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,068
Papa, why does God give us wings
when we die?

58
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,611
[Frederick clearing throat]

59
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,446
God gives us wings so we can...

60
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:07,574
fly out from paradise
and look down upon the world.

61
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,827
- Does Mama look down on me?
- Yes...

62
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:15,830
and she smiles when she hears your prayers.

63
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,501
Do you still love Mama?

64
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:22,960
Always.

65
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,131
Then why is she coming?

66
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:40,350
Come here, little bird.

67
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,185
Papa.

68
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,311
What?

69
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,187
What if she doesn't like me?

70
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:50,356
She will adore you.

71
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,358
Just as I do.

72
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,195
There she is! She's coming!

73
00:07:58,987 --> 00:07:59,988
Hurry!

74
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,293
Where is Lilli?

75
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:19,130
Lilli.

76
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,706
My lady.

77
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:59,376
- You're welcome in my house.
- Thank you, Frederick.

78
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,426
Welcome, my lady.

79
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:10,760
Lady.

80
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,685
Lilliana, where have you been?

81
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,187
Look what I found.

82
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,232
It'll be a butterfly someday.

83
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:32,736
Lilli, I want you to meet Lady Claudia.

84
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,531
Can I put her in a box?

85
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:40,243
- Who?
- The caterpillar.

86
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:46,248
Let me see.

87
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,421
What will you do with her
when she grows wings?

88
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:55,631
I'll let her go.

89
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,094
I have a box with a special surprise inside.

90
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,262
Just for you.

91
00:10:17,109 --> 00:10:21,279
Treat him well and he will always be faithful.

92
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,658
- Look, Nannau.
- Come along now, child.

93
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,345
It's beautiful.

94
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,141
Now it is yours as well.

95
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,939
This is my brother, Gustav.

96
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,693
God did not bless him
with a graceful tongue...

97
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:06,987
but he more than compensates
with the wit of his hands.

98
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,461
Now, I will leave you to unpack.

99
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:56,326
- What a lovely view.
- Yes, milady.

100
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,828
It was Lady Hoffman's favorite.

101
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:01,804
Was it?

102
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,267
Please be careful. It was my mother's.

103
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,645
Thank you. All of you.

104
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,647
Out. Out.

105
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:20,360
[Humming]

106
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,117
Tomorrow I will be a wife.

107
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,370
A Hoffman.

108
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,669
What would mother say
if she could see me now?

109
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,462
Here.

110
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,635
Would she be happy for me?

111
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,720
Would she smile?

112
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,181
Or would she be angry...

113
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,893
knowing that the world,
which so despised her...

114
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,853
has embraced me?

115
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:12,235
I do love him, Gustav.

116
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,715
And he will love me.

117
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:42,430
I just wanted to be sure
that you have everything you need.

118
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:46,600
Thank you, my lord.
But I am not well provided for at all.

119
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,101
How's that?

120
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,519
I have everything I need.

121
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,271
Your company.

122
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:01,070
You are very beautiful, Claudia.

123
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:06,241
I love to hear the sound of my name
on your lips.

124
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:09,201
- Your hands are cold.
- Warm them for me.

125
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,605
[Claudia singing]

126
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:30,697
[Children clapping]

[Chanting]

128
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,177
Amen.

129
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,526
Go on, child.

130
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,499
FREDERICK: Lilli!

131
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,919
Lilli!

132
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:37,883
Odo?

133
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,513
Odo?

134
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,226
[Clanging]

135
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,575

[Shushing]

138
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:42,776
Lilli?

139
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:50,450
I saw you come in here, child.

140
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:52,284
Now show yourself.

141
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:29,903
[Screaming]

142
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,666
Nannau!

143
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:58,180
May she rest in peace.

144
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,513
[Sobbing]

145
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,295
Do you remember my mother, Ilsa?

146
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,797
I was young. But I remember her.

147
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:40,052
- Is my face like hers?
- Yes.

148
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,221
Especially when you smile.

149
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,724
My father worshipped her, didn't he?

150
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:49,725
It's not for me to say, milady.

151
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:51,184
[Odo growling]

152
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:52,893
What is it, Odo?

153
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,561
[Odo barking]

154
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:58,064
- It's Peter.
- What? Back so soon from Paris?

155
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:03,235
Hold on now. You can't go running off
in your shift. You'll catch your death.

156
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,572
Don't you ever wonder what's out there,
Ilsa, beyond the fields and walls?

157
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:11,407
The beasts of the forest, I imagine.

158
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,492
There must be more to the world
than the forest.

159
00:20:14,575 --> 00:20:17,578
Why would you want to leave
your good home?

160
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:22,749
Because it's not the same home anymore.
It hasn't been for a long time.

161
00:20:26,294 --> 00:20:30,464
Nine years of casting the runes.

162
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:35,969
Nine long years of waiting for you to come.

163
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,142
And now you move inside of me.

164
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,229
Your blood mingles with mine.

165
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,777
You grow stronger
with every beat of my heart.

166
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,287
And I seem to grow more beautiful
with each beat of yours.

167
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:12,377
Father in heaven...

168
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,671
in thy mercy I pray.

169
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:19,215
Grant me a son.

170
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,844
It was round, like a ball.

171
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,930
And on it was a picture
of all the lands in the world.

172
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:29,306
- It sounds fantastic.
- It was.

173
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,309
Tell me about Paris.
Tell me how the ladies spend their days.

174
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,853
- Lady Hoffman.
- Dr. Gutenberg, how was your trip?

175
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:38,812
Much too long, I'm afraid.

176
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,771
It doesn't show on you at all.

177
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:43,898
- You're looking radiant as always.
- Thank you.

178
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:46,149
Lilli, shouldn't you be getting ready
for tonight?

179
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:49,526
I wanted to speak with Peter for a moment.

180
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,278
But your dress is not appropriate
for such a conversation.

181
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,033
Ladies, if you'll excuse me.

182
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,125
Lilli.

183
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:12,796
Lilli, I have a dress
for you to try on for tonight.

184
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:15,298
I'll try it on later.

00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:46,210
I'm sure he wouldn't mind too much if we
took just a little something for ourselves...

368
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:48,795
before we give you back.

369
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:51,005
I mean, he's a big man, right?

370
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:54,049
I bet he'd understand.

371
00:48:58,344 --> 00:49:00,304
Let her be, Rolf.

372
00:49:03,682 --> 00:49:06,601
Maybe you ought to soak yourself
in the river.

373
00:49:08,603 --> 00:49:11,355
I'm just trying to keep things lively.

374
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,359
Go on, go.

375
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:18,401
Get out!

376
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:22,988
- Why don't you just leave?
- Go on.

377
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:28,993
You're going to die down there.

378
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:34,665
Under the ground.

379
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,628
All of you is gonna die.

380
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:09,155
Give me your eyes.

381
00:50:11,574 --> 00:50:13,617
And your wings.

382
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,874
The world is a dangerous place, princess.
Keep this close.

383
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:32,218
- What about her?
- What about her?

384
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,970
What if she flees? Runs away?

385
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:37,763
Let her.

386
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:40,848
She'll never find her way out of here.

387
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:42,307
I don't like it.

388
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:52,524
[Hissing]

389
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,901
[Gasping]

390
00:51:02,116 --> 00:51:03,325
[Cawing]

391
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:19,840
The little princess is following us.

392
00:51:20,507 --> 00:51:24,052
Hey Lars, maybe she'll help us find the gold.

393
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:51,078
Put her to work with a pick and a shovel.

394
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:59,294
You're not afraid, are you, my child?

395
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:55,015
My sweetest son, I will keep you safe...

396
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:58,560
and warm with me.

397
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:15,409
And she will never hurt you again...

398
00:53:21,748 --> 00:53:24,167
when she's buried in the ground.

399
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:36,304
Did you think you could hide from me?

400
00:53:37,054 --> 00:53:40,140
Did you think I wouldn't be able
to find you?

401
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:02,829
What's the matter? Are you frightened?

402
00:54:05,623 --> 00:54:08,083
Is your little heart beginning to pound?

403
00:54:17,884 --> 00:54:19,468
[Lilli screaming]

404
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,302
Goodbye, Lilli.

405
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:46,160
Lilli, get the rope! Grab the rope.

406
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:16,022
Pull. Pull!

407
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,898
Go on.

408
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,359
- Pull! Gilbert, hold on!
- Wait.

409
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,737
Keep climbing!

410
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:31,493
Come on, Gilbert! Take hold of my hand.

411
00:55:32,702 --> 00:55:36,580
- Come on!
- I can't do it.

412
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,090
[Humming]

413
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:11,321
- Ilsa.
- Yes, milady?

414
00:56:12,113 --> 00:56:15,116
Would you take some of this lovely soup
to my husband?

415
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:16,700
Yes, milady.

416
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:19,952
And cover your hair.

417
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,146
Maybe Rolf was right.
Maybe we should have ransomed her.

418
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:54,275
She's brought nothing but black luck
since she came here.

419
00:56:56,277 --> 00:56:58,028
The day is leaving us.

420
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:01,072
Let's get moving.

421
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,701
Greta.

422
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:07,243
[Bell ringing]

423
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,597
Damn it, where is everybody?

424
00:57:12,848 --> 00:57:14,349
Bruno.

425
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:25,651
It's just the two of us now, Frederick.

426
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,573
Your little girl is gone.

427
00:57:34,575 --> 00:57:38,537
Perhaps the earth has swallowed her up.

428
00:57:39,996 --> 00:57:41,789
<i>You must be sure.</i>

429
00:57:56,678 --> 00:57:59,681
Never look a raven in the eye for too long.

430
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:04,685
It might steal your soul and fly away with it.

431
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:12,484
Why are you staring at me?

432
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:15,736
It hadn't occurred to me
to look anywhere else.

433
00:58:15,819 --> 00:58:18,905
- It's very rude.
- It's one of my better habits.

434
00:58:19,155 --> 00:58:21,323
I take it you have no manners then.

435
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:22,990
No manners then...

436
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:25,992
and no manners now.

437
00:58:27,076 --> 00:58:29,244
Are you trying to be funny?

438
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:33,372
I was just wondering what it would take...

439
00:58:34,164 --> 00:58:35,915
to make a princess smile.

440
00:58:36,498 --> 00:58:39,751
- I'm not a princess.
- What are you then?

441
00:58:42,879 --> 00:58:45,673
I am the daughter of Frederick Hoffman.

442
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,010
Yeah.

443
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,095
So, you're nothing more than a name.

444
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:58,517
What right do you have to say that?
You know nothing about me.

445
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,727
I know enough of your kind.

446
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,605
How could you know anything
about anyone?

447
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:07,357
You live like an animal,
you hide out like a criminal.

448
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,776
And what are you doing, princess?
Is this some holiday you're taking?

449
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:11,943
My father will find--

450
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:14,695
Where is this great father of yours?
How come he hasn't rescued you?

451
00:59:14,778 --> 00:59:15,862
He'll find me, I know it!

452
00:59:20,783 --> 00:59:22,618
What if he doesn't?

453
00:59:25,787 --> 00:59:28,623
- I don't like the way you speak to me.
- How would you have me speak?

454
00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:31,876
Like a civilized gentleman, not some savage.

455
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:37,047
That is a word I will not bear
from the lips of any man or woman.

456
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,715
The last time I heard that word spoken...

457
00:59:40,298 --> 00:59:43,301
was by one of your so-called gentlemen.

458
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:47,888
And there was nothing gentle about it.
Or civilized.

459
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:50,807
Let go of me.

460
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:54,477
Why?

461
00:59:55,978 --> 00:59:58,063
Because you frighten me.

462
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:39,895
Frederick?

463
01:00:49,988 --> 01:00:51,489
Lady Hoffman?

464
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,664
Frederick!

465
01:01:04,876 --> 01:01:06,335
Lady Hoffman!

466
01:01:14,426 --> 01:01:15,510
Frederick?

467
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:23,226
Dr. Gutenberg.

468
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:28,022
Lady Hoffman. Excuse me.
I was expecting one of your servants.

469
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:29,564
They've gone.

470
01:01:30,523 --> 01:01:31,899
Gone?

471
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,735
- All of them?
- Yes.

472
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:40,614
- They became very ill quite suddenly.
- What has happened here?

473
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:45,910
It was terrible, even to look at them.
They could barely walk.

474
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:50,372
Their hands and their feet
were filled with blood, and their faces--

475
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:52,081
The Black Death.

476
01:01:52,122 --> 01:01:55,083
I didn't want to send them away,
they were like our family.

477
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:56,917
You were compelled to do so.

478
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,630
Everything has happened,
with Lilli still gone and....

479
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:05,090
- Yes.
- And with Frederick.

480
01:02:05,799 --> 01:02:07,884
I'm trying to be strong.

481
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,595
I have no one to turn to...

482
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,764
for solace and understanding.

483
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,267
I feel so alone.

484
01:02:20,477 --> 01:02:21,978
So alone.

485
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:45,626
What a fine young man you are.

486
01:02:49,421 --> 01:02:51,840
What a wonderful husband
you're going to make Lilli.

487
01:02:57,262 --> 01:02:59,013
I miss her so much.

488
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:02,349
Will you find her for me?

489
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,142
Yes, of course.

490
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:07,311
I can rely on you, then?

491
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,814
I promise.

492
01:03:13,649 --> 01:03:17,152
- I promise.
- I'll tell Frederick you called.

493
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:19,863
He's much better.

494
01:03:41,509 --> 01:03:42,801
[Moaning]

495
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:13,039
He dreams of fire.

496
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:21,713
They tied him to a stake,
then burned his family while he watched.

497
01:04:22,922 --> 01:04:27,259
Then they placed
a red-hot cross of iron on his face.

498
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:33,223
- Because he would not repent.
- What was his crime?

499
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:38,227
- He would not fight for their cause.
- Who were they?

500
01:04:40,729 --> 01:04:42,856
Crusaders for the Church.

501
01:04:43,898 --> 01:04:45,274
Men of God.

502
01:04:47,776 --> 01:04:50,278
My face, it frightens you?

503
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:52,070
Yes.

504
01:04:52,904 --> 01:04:54,864
Scares me, too.

505
01:05:03,581 --> 01:05:04,873
[Humming]

506
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:13,755
FREDERICK: Lilli.

507
01:05:18,426 --> 01:05:19,635
Father?

508
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,225
<i>Lilli.</i>

509
01:05:34,774 --> 01:05:36,317
Father?

510
01:05:40,612 --> 01:05:41,613
Father?

511
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,662
<i>Lilli.</i>

512
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,750
<i>Lilliana.</i>

513
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:00,672
<i>Lilli.</i>

514
01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:05,467
Father.

515
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:07,802
<i>Lilliana.</i>

516
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:13,098
Lilli.

517
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:22,356
Lilli!

518
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:27,026
Lilli.

519
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:37,995
Lilli.

520
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,681
Lilli!

521
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:08,565
Lilli, over here.

522
01:07:18,575 --> 01:07:20,868
Come on! This way!

523
01:07:32,212 --> 01:07:33,338
No.

524
01:07:33,421 --> 01:07:34,672
Watch out.

525
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:36,840
No.

526
01:07:45,723 --> 01:07:46,849
Lars!

527
01:07:53,397 --> 01:07:55,607
- Lilli, no!
- We can't leave him.

528
01:07:57,734 --> 01:07:59,402
Lilli, come back.

529
01:08:01,237 --> 01:08:03,072
Reach out your hand.

530
01:08:09,411 --> 01:08:10,620
Come on.

531
01:08:11,037 --> 01:08:12,371
I got it.

532
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,123
Help me.

533
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,584
- Don't.
- No!

534
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,441
Good journey.

535
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:53,408
Good journey, old friend.

536
01:08:54,826 --> 01:08:57,912
- Good journey.
- Good journey.

537
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:00,557
Good journey.

538
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:14,279
Why does she live?

539
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:18,699
<i>While your child lies cold and still.</i>

540
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:21,576
What?

541
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:25,412
<i>Take back the child and give him life.</i>

542
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,749
How?

543
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:33,292
<i>Steal the father's seed.</i>

544
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:36,920
<i>Bathe the child in the father's blood.</i>

545
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:41,215
Frederick's life...

546
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:43,425
for his.

547
01:10:10,618 --> 01:10:14,038
Hello, Frederick. Did you miss me?

548
01:10:15,622 --> 01:10:16,956
Claudia.
