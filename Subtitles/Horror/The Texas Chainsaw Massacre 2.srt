Please don't kill me!

534

Leatherface. [laughs]

542
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,401
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?

543
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:29,202
She was my fave, but she knew.

544
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:33,289
And now, nobody knows.

545
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,712
Look what you did
to my plate, you bitch!

546

You got her? Did you get her good?

547
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,012
Slap me five.

548

555
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,340
No, they'll get away.

556
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,509
No, no, they'll get away.

557
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,179
They can't get away.

00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,321
God damn it, Lefty. You're late.

Damn it, Lefty.

Lefty, they came! Where were you?

570
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,272
I had to do it.
Damn, I used you, girl.

571

I'm here now. Grab hold of this.

Oh, my God.

578
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:52,918
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger
that walks beside me,

579
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,087
that takes away my strength.

580
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:59,091
Lord, you show me the end.

581
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,053
Show me what I fear
so I don't fear it no more.

I'm bringing it down! Down to hell!

586

Not Bubba's. Me! Me!

593

No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.

[Drayton] Tonight's a washout.

597
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:02,107
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month,
and we're gonna lose money on it.

598
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,401
Damn it all!
Maybe we just ought to quit.

599
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:09,114
[man] Oh, yeah? Kiss my plate,
Mr. Big Shot. Maybe you forgot.

600
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,617
This chrome dome
bankrolled this food business.

601
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,286
No lucky gook with a machete,
no head wound.

602
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:17,664
No head wound,
no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.

603

Ain't no fool. Kiss it.
Don't forget it.

- That's my sweet pea.
- Get them hogs on the grill.

607
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,018
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow
means a ton of croissant sandwiches.

608

Oh, I love this town.

609

Gotta go fast to catch it."

You dumb baboons are
too dumb to even close the door.

You trying to hide something?

We need the club sandwiches...

Put that down.

Get your ass over here.

Valuable kill-time wasted running down
them coked-up pencil necks,

683
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,753
and not a good chop on the whole bunch.

684
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,880
I pick the vittles. Get it?

685
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,883

[Drayton] Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.

Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.

You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.

693
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,951
Of course this is what happens.

- That big brute!

695
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,956
Dirty meat don't cut it.

696
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:28,710
Family standards only require
the best meat in town.

01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,462
More money lost.

698
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:33,465
I never, never, never get a break.

01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,687
and sawing down your own house.

703
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,072
Take it all down!

704
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,491
Bring it all down!

705
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,993
Bury the devil!

706
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:11,086
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Ah!

707
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,840
Get that thing out of here.

708
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,511
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.

709
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,680
It's up there. Go look at it.

710
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,391
Taxes. Taxes.

711
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,353
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.

712
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,190
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.

713
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,359
Movie stars don't.

714
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:39,781
It's the little guy that can't make
a dime. He pays the taxes.

715
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,534
Small businessman
gets it in the ass every time.

716
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,577
I ought to quit.

717
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:48,540
Right, it's junk. Quit.
Dump this cook show.

718
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:52,877
Sell off this turkey.
It's time. It's in the air.

719
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,838
It's what the public wants.

720
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,840
I don't wanna hear that again.

721
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,300
It's 'Nam Land!

722
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,346
- [fizzling]
- [yelps]

723
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,683
Yow! What the hell was that?

724
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:10,562
[high-pitched] I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.

725
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,775
[cackling]

726
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,947
'Nam Land.

727
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,783
Napalm.

728
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,911
Fire in the hole.

729
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,420
That's the main butane tank
up there, Bubba.

730
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,048
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.

731
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:42,760
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.

732
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:46,347
- I'll kick you in the ass again.
- Not now. It's 'Nam Land.

733
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,851
- It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.

734
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,781
Did you see it?

735
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,825
Well, did you? Didn't you?

736
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,286
Did you? Didn't you?

737
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,997
Go check it out, boy.

738
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:15,001
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!

739
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,879
I told you to go check it out, boy,
before I start kicking your ass.

740
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:22,050
Some kind of crazy booger
just skipped through here.

741
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,220
No, a booger? How big?

742
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:29,849
[high-pitched] A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.

743
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,250
[whispers] Oh, my God.

744
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,174
Oh, God.

745
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,896
Franklin.

746
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,042
Don't you cry, my brother.

747
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:45,883
I'm here now.

748
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,970
They can't do this.

749
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,597
They can't do this!

750
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:55,852
They can't do this! They can't do this!

751
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,947
I'll take you back to hell!

752
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,616
I'll take you to hell!

753
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,768
[whimpering]

754
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,697
- [saw buzzing]
- [screams]

755
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,953
[screams]

756
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:59,624
[panting]

757
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,412
[screaming]

758
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:42,583
[shouting]

759
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,717
All right, all right!

760
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,762
Let's talk about it.

761
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,307
OK. What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?

762
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:43,019
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
[sobbing]

763
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:49,108
I'm trying to be open with you. It's
nobody's fault. I just can't do this.

764
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,252
Let me go.

765
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,789
What the hell's going on here?

766
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,711
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.

767
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,588
Get out of here.

768
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,969
Who's this? I get it.

769
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:21,349
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?

770
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,351
Trying to put me out of business?

771
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,770
Thousands of dollars lost.

772
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,773
You got that kind of money? No!

773
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:33,402
It's the deejay. My fave.

774
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,613
That dirty thing?

775
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,573
Told me you boys got her.

776
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,742
[man] Well, yeah.

777
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,578
Leatherface killed her
once already tonight.

778
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:46,165
But look, she's red-faced.

779
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,127
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.

780
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,964
Bubba's got a girlfriend.

781
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:59,845
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

782
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:03,307
Bubba's got a girl... [screams, laughs]

783
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,601
Is that what this is, Bubba?

784
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,604
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?

785
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:12,233
S-C-E-X. Sex.

786
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,236
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?

787
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,363
You just couldn't leave it alone.

788
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,241
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?

789
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,202
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?

790
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,663
Ask me. Ask me.

791
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,834
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.

792
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,670
[sobbing] Help me. Help me.

793
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,338
Help me.

794
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,340
Please, help me. Please.

795
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:37,675
[imitating] Help me.

796
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,969
[sobbing] Please, help me.

797
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:46,517
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

798
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,269
Leave him alone, damn it!

799
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:54,692
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.

800
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,739
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.

801
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,532
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.

802
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,244
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

803
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:07,997
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!

804
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,707
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!

805
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,876
- Finish her!
- Finish her. Finish her.

806
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,714
Give me that.

807
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:20,676
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.

808
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:25,556
You got one choice, boy,
sex or the saw.

809
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,809
Sex is, well, nobody knows.

810
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:32,938
But the saw, the saw is family.

811
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:37,068
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.

812
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,073
Take her away.

813
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:47,244
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.

814
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,123
- Oh, no.
- A-one...

815
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,876
and a-two...

816
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,962
and a-three!

817
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,768
[screaming] No!

818
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,442
[Drayton] Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.

819
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,945
Eat and run. Eat and run.

820
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,490
There's a lot of hungry
football fans to feed.

821
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:28,077
Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast.

822
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:31,539
He always did. Come on. Come on.

823
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,458
Time eats money.

824
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:39,130
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the family.

825
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:44,135
I stoop my shoulders
taking care of my younger brothers.

826
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:48,222
It squashed the young years
out of my life

827
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,142
like a can of cheese whip.

828
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:55,396
I wouldn't wish this rotten life

829
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,900
off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.

830
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:04,196
You're the first girl
Bubba's brought home to dinner.

831
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,741
This is a real special occasion.

832
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:10,119
Grandpa sure looks forward
to meeting you.

833
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:14,331
He's 137 years old
but still as fast as Jesse James,

834
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:16,500
so don't you worry none.

835
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,428
- Here comes Grandpa now.
- [Stretch screams]

836
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,921
God bless you, Grandpa.

837
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:24,633
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!

838
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:27,470
Your little boys
have some left here for you.

839
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,889
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!

840
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:33,100
[Drayton, man] We love you!
We love you!

841
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:38,606
OK, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.

842
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,941
- That's right. That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.

843
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,109
- That's right. OK.
- Come on, you boys.

844
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,279
- [Stretch screaming]
- Easy with Grandpa, now.

845
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,364
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No! No!

846
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,533
[Stretch] Oh, please, no.

847
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:53,204
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!

848
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,539
You're balling up his shit.

849
01:19:58,418 --> 01:19:59,376
[screaming] No!

850
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:03,964
Grandpa's strict liquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.

851
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,299
Every spring,

852
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:10,763
the Atlas Rendering Company used to
throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.

853
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,890
He was the master.

854
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,892
He was the one and only.

855
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,062
He showed us all the business.

856
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:21,607
We was raised in meat. [laughs]

857
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:25,903
But then after the glory,
here comes the shame.

858
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,364
Atlas went for automation.

859
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,991
The electrified cages,

860
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,785
the cold-steel chutes,

861
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,079
the air-powered head hammers.

862
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,999
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done like that.

863
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,544
Let me go! Let me go!

864
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:46,006
No, no, that's all right. That's all
right. It'll be over soon.

865
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:52,263
Get the hammer.

866
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:55,307
The crunching and the grinding,

867
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,935
he just couldn't stand it, no way.

868
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,437
So that was all she wrote.

869
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:04,441
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.

870
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,277
It was the shame.

871
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:09,864
It was the shame. The shame.

872
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,993
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.

873
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,537
