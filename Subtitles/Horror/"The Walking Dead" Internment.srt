Yes.

Henry, I need you to calm down.

We're trying to help.

18
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:07,203

00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:42,720
Some council meeting, huh?

24
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,022
We're two members short.

25
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,826
Hershel: I think we should make some
new rules before they get back.

26
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,413
I hereby declare we have
spaghetti Tuesdays

27
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:54,398
every Wednesday.

28
00:02:57,503 --> 00:03:00,288
First we have to find
some spaghetti.

29

You okay to take over?

30
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:19,357
Every five to six
seconds, squeeze.

31
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,759
You start feeling lightheaded,

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,779
grab somebody else
to take over.

33

<i>We'll take it in shifts.</i>

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,778
You want to help me
go on my rounds?

35
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,230
Yeah.

36
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,032
Sure.

37
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,056
How long will that
keep him alive?

38
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,979
Just as long
as we're willing to do it.

39
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,566
As long as it takes.

Help me get him on this.

45
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:49,185
Okay, but in a couple
of hours when Henry's dead--

46
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,438
- Glenn.
- How are we gonna get his body

47
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,190
down the stairs,
across the cell block

48
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,026
and through those doors
without anyone noticing?

49
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,779
If that happens-- if--
you're gonna help me.

50
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,688
And what if I'm gone?

51
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,524
Shut up and help me
get him on this.

52
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:16,225
What are you doing?

53
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,365
We're taking Mr. Jacobson
to a quieter place.

54
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:30,101
Go get my copy of "Tom
Sawyer" from my room.

55
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,542
I want you to
read it by tonight.

57
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,670
- That one's yours.
- I won't finish it.

58
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,117
Why?

59
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,908
It's gonna get too dark.

60
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,094
Well,

61
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,257
give it your best try.

this yet, have you?

64

There was one late last night.

65
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,453
Sasha did it.

66
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:19,740
People don't need to see it.

67
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,742

He was helping me

- If you need help, I can help you.
- I don't.

him occupied.

Keeping his mind
on helping people.

80

Tyreese is gonna
be back here soon,

119

she should be here.

120
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,688
And I couldn't have her here.

121

She has a car, supplies,

122
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,584
she'll figure it out.

123

Don't tell anyone else yet.

- Yeah.

00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:15,616
Found some food on the run.

fruit leather in there.

147
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:19,953
Have everybody brush
their teeth after.

- Can we come out soon?
- Not just yet.

149

Dad, I was around you when you
were in the middle of it.

150

I can help you.

152
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,338

No, you need to focus on
the ones that can make it.

172
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,984
I made some more IVs.

173

it'll happen one
after the other.

177
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,108
And they don't just die.

178
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,448

Get back in bed now.
We're not that bad off.

184
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:47,746
When we are,

185
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:50,272
it'll be too late.

186
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,691
You don't understand.

187
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,361
You have a chance.

188
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,079
This is it after this.

189
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,314
I'm not giving up on anyone.

190
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,534
Not yet.

191
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,987
Just make sure everyone's
doors are shut.

192
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,269
Caleb...

193
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,304
Just make sure!

194
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,673
( coughing )

195
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,114
Caleb, you've got
to let me look at you.

196
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:28,192
Okay, Hershel.

197
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,208
Have a look.

198
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,806
Drink the tea I left you.

199
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,476
Gonna be back to check
on you in an hour.

200
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:44,445
( coughing, gagging )

201
00:15:55,324 --> 00:15:58,376
( gurgling )

202
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,128

203
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:17,061
<i>( distant coughing )</i>

204
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,304
Everyone,

205
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,524
get back in your cells.

206
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:37,498
Go on, get back in your cells.

207
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,423
Let's get him on this.

208
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:05,893
( grunting )

209
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:08,529
( panting )

210
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,034
Go rest.

211
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,536
Can you make it to your cell?

00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,409
Rick:
<i>Hershel.</i>

222
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,803
Third one we've lost.

223
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:24,355
We're burning them
behind the blocks.

224
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:26,808
Burning them.

225
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:30,561
That's what it's come to.

226
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,982
Are you okay?

227
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:39,603
I talked to him yesterday
about Steinbeck.

228
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,123
He told me a quote.

229
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,876
"A sad soul

230
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,246
can kill quicker
than a germ."

231
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:53,951
That's exactly why I didn't want
them all to see what happens.

232
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,422
I know they know,

233
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:01,759
but I didn't want them
to see it right now.

234
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,513
They're seeing you, Hershel.

235
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,633
They see you

236
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,736
keep going.

237
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:14,906
Even after all the choices
keep getting taken away.

238
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:25,482
When we get past this thing...

239
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,653
it's not gonna be like
how it was, is it?

240
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,156
No.

241
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:39,347
Was that denial?

242
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,215
Not seeing things
for how they were?

243
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,000
No.

244
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,219
You just caught a break.

245
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,890
You needed some time.
You got some.

246
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:51,008
You got lucky.

247
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,394
We all did.

248
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:56,781
I still think there's a plan.

249
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,234
I still believe
there's a reason.

250
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,289
You think it's all a test?

251
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,293
Life was always a test, Rick.

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,468
I need to talk
to you about Carol.

253
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,238
( rattles )

254
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,560
( rattles )

255
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:01,295
Come on.

256
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,464
Come on, Sasha.

257
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,385
You know how to fight.

258
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,921
<i>Just hold on.</i>

259
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:18,479
<i>Just hold on.</i>
<i>Don't give up on me, now.</i>

260
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,335
( growling )

261
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,346
I just talked to your dad.

262
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:40,699
He looks good,
all things considered.

263
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,703
If Carl were sick, would
you be up there with him?

264
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,791
If I thought I could help.

265
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,592
You don't think I can help?

266
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,266
( yelps )

267
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,101
- ( grunts )
- Damn.

268
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,141
I'm just glad
you're out here with me.

269
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,824
Welcome back.

270
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,911
I passed out?

271
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,413
You were dehydrated.

272
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,299
Being a hero takes
a lot out of you.

273
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,368
You should know.

274
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,508
I thought you were an
idiot to come in here.

275
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,927
I mean, I was sure
you were just gonna be

276
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,513
a dead foolish man.

277
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:46,848
I can't tell
if that's a compliment.

278
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,434
I don't know what I'm saying.

279
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,554
I must have hit my head.

280
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,912
I don't believe in magic

281
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,115
or luck.

282
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,619
I do the math

283
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,088
and I don't gamble.

284
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,260
But I don't know
if I'd be here right now

285
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,130
if you weren't so damn stupid.

286
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,432
You know what?

287
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,385
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

288
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:31,560
( hissing )

289
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,950
( air hissing )

290
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,980
Hersh--
( coughs )

291
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,267
Hershel--
( coughing )

292
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,822
( retching )

293
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,996
( rattling )

294
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,582
I'll check on you
in a little while.

295
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,371
How is he?

296
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,123
He's sleeping.

297
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:37,793
You should get
some rest yourself.

298
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:41,513
I don't want to leave him
in case he wakes up.

299
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,716
( rattling )

300
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,968
- Want me to take a look at him?
- No.

301
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,055
Just let him sleep.

302
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,724
( wheezing )

303
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:58,446
- ( growling )
- Hershel!

304
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:00,232
Hershel!

305
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,851
( growling )

306
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:09,958
Everyone stay in your cells.

307
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,197
No.

308
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,749
( crunches )

309
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,587
<i>( woman screams )</i>

<i>Go.</i>

312
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,481
The fence is more important.
We need to keep it standing.

313
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,600
I got this.

314
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,789
- You can't do this alone.
- I know. Go.

315
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:53,001
- ( gunshot )
- ( screaming )

316
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,126
Lizzy:
<i>Just follow me, Henry.</i>

317
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,078
Down here, away from Glenn.
Come on.

318
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,883
<i>Come on, Henry.</i>
<i>Here we go. This way.</i>

00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:24,866
Come on, boy.
Come on, Henry.

322
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,569
Just a little more.

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,270
<i>Keep coming.</i>

324
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,323
<i>Come on, boy.</i>
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

325
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:39,072
Carl?

326
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:44,945
( softly )
Carl...?

327
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:48,115
Carl.

328
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,917
I heard gunshots.

329
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:51,702
I need your help.

330
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,374
Lizzie: Come on.
Down here, Henry.

331
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,543
Keep following me.
Come here.

332
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:02,546
A little further.

333
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:04,765
Henry, come on--

334
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,500
( screaming )

335
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:19,846
- You okay?
- I called him nice.

336
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,682
He didn't scratch Glenn.
I thought maybe he listens.

337
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,185
- Lizzy, where is Glenn?
- His cell.

338
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,372
( panting )

339
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:31,325
Dad!

340
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,744
Dad! Open the door!

341
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:38,131

344
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:47,841
Get back in there.

345
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:51,678
You two stay put in here.

346
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,814

Hold on, Glenn.
Hold on.

Caleb, we need the gun.

Think they're okay?

357
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:42,145
If things were going bad, we
would have heard more shots.

358
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:43,947
Maggie would have gotten us.

359
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,866
We have to do this.

360
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:47,701
Let's do it.

361
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,656
- I got it.
- Let me help.

362
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,913
All right, set it down.
All right.

363
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:03,616

Wait!

366
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,677
