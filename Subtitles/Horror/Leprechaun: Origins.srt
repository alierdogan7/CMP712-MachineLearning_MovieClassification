00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,958
Sophie.

355
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,856
Hey.

356
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,857
Sit down.

357
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,959
Come on, sit down.

358
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,011
It's gotta be done, son.

359
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,480
This doesn't feel right, Da.

360
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,116
It's never easy.

361
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,858
Ah, thanks, Ian.

362
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,025
No problem.

363
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,700
Not sure my son has the
stomach for this, after all.

364
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:13,638
Wouldn't it be easier just
to leave this village?

365
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:18,876
You don't abandon your home just
because the times get tough.

366
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:22,313
'Round these parts you
fight for what's yours.

367
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,482
By letting innocent people die?

368
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:29,387
No, Sean, not innocent. Outsiders.

369
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:32,924
Now they came here of
their own free will.

370
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:37,192
We're just giving 'em a little push
in the right direction, that's all.

371
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,130
Hey, Dave, this is gonna hurt, man.

372
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,918
(WHISPERING) God...

373
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,097
Should've been enough time, huh?

374
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,267
Seem to have misplaced my watch.

375
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,885
There didn't have
to be four of them.

376
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:39,257
You knew there would come a time when
you'd have to give us a helpin' hand

377
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,891
rather than stayin'
back where it's safe

378
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,859
and letting other people
do the dirty work.

379
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,295
Yeah, well...

380
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,267
Maybe if you all hadn't
have been so greedy,

381
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,969
and taken all that
gold from its cave...

382
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,839
Well, maybe if we
increase our offerin',

383
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,276
we can buy us some
lenience the next time!

384
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,243
Next time...

385
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,870
This is it.

386
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:30,138
Oh, my God, this is the symbol that
was on the stone outside of town.

387
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,841
That's it.

388
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,484
It can't be right.

389
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,454
What?

390
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,655
It means...

391
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,757
<i>Tuatha De Danann.</i>

392
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,927
What the fuck does that mean?

393
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,763
Leprechaun.

394
00:38:56,734 --> 00:39:00,338
Come on! Leprechaun?

395
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,338
I'm just telling you what it says.

396
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:11,246
Whatever it is, you think that's
what they dug up in that mine?

397
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,453
It wasn't a mine
originally, it was a cave.

398
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,689
But the people in the village took the
gold, that's what Hamish said to us.

399
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,125
Okay, now we're
talking pots of gold?

400
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,394
I know.

401
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:26,695
I know it sounds crazy, but...

402
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,005
SOPHIE: This is what happens
when you take its gold.

403
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,410
You have to make amends.

404
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:42,010
Until the debt has been repaid.

405
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,751
So they put us in this cabin
they locked us in there

406
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:51,219
to sacrifice us to a leprechaun?

407
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,727
You guys, my earring was gold.

408
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:01,432
Okay, guys, leprechaun,
<i>Tuatha de,</i> whatever the hell,

409
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:05,901
killing machine, whatever the fuck
it is. How do we get out of here?

410
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,707
Look, these stones
are like a boundary,

411
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,942
like an ancient warning
sign or something.

412
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,645
SOPHIE: Maybe the leprechaun won't go
past a certain distance from its cave...

413
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,581
So?

414
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,451
So, if we make it to the stones...

415
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,487
Then what, the leprechaun won't
go past the stones, Sophie?

416
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,623
Really?

417
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:30,025
No, that makes sense. That's why the guy
who dropped us off didn't go past them.

418
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,797
We have to get back there.

419
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,674
Jesus Christ.

420
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,542
Where the hell are they?

421
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,778
They got out?

422
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:26,448
If they're still alive,
that means it hasn't fed!

423
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,251
Let's go!

424
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,525
HAMISH: In the trucks, now!

(TRUCK DOOR CLOSES)

426
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,377
HAMISH: Lord, have mercy.

427
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,215
They're back.

428
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,449
What are we going to do, guys?

429
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,727
Everybody grab something!

430
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,662
HAMISH: Check downstairs,
down the basement!

431
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,830
Check the attic!

432
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:11,119

Well done.

437
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,649
Drop it, guys.

438
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,884
I don't think so, boy-o.

439
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:19,154
How the hell did all of you
get out of that cabin?

440
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:23,727
Maybe they've earned
their freedom, Da.

441
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:26,130
And have that thing, come
back to our village?

442
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:29,197
Start preyin' on us again?

443
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,637
Or you?

444
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,978
