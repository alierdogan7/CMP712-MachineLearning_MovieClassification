357
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,124
Hey, you don't gotta explain to me.

358
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,568
If I'd gotten into college, I would've left
this town and never looked back.

359
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,409
Never would have given it a second thought.

360
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,404
That's not true.
I thought about this place a lot.

361
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,722
I missed you.
I'm sorry I didn't call more.

362
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,926
I just wanted a clean breakaway, I guess.

363
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,922
But me leaving
never had anything to do with you.

364
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,367
It's okay. I understand.

Oh, I told her the truth.

370
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,291
I told her I was with a Make-A-Wish kid.

371
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,447
- So tell me what's going on.
-Oh...

You seemed so scared back there.

373
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,491
Um, okay.
I've been having nightmares.

374
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,810
I've been having really bad dreams,

375
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,282
and they're so real that I think I'm going crazy.

376
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,804
I dreamed there's this girl.
She looks dead,

377
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,729
and she's trying to get me, kill me.

378
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,847
And there's this man.
It looks like he's been burnt to death,

379
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,728
and he looks at me like I did it.

380
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,804
Like whatever happened to him,
it was my fault.

381
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,844
Well, after everything you've been through,

382
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,008
it would be weird
if you weren't having nightmares, right?

383
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,929
Have you thought about seeing a shrink?

384
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,207
I can't afford it.

385
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,368
I mean, if I had any money at all,

386
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,124
I wouldn't have come home to live with Dad.

387
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,527
I'm flat broke.

388
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,449
And there are these tapes.

that's what that last reading meant...</i>

390

392
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,160
I really don't think you should
be watching these anymore.

393

Would you watch them if it was your mom?

396

Your only chance to get to know her?

397
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,642
Yeah, I would, but I'd wait,
wait until I was recuperated.

398
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,725
Not when I was still
stuck in this house where she died.

399
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,043
I mean, it's just weird.

400
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,209
And besides,
she's wrong more than she's right.

401
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,084
She said you never left town,
you love to swim.

402
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,326
She said Dad was gonna die.

403
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,129
No, she thought you were gonna die.

404
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,044
She said 10 things that were wrong,

405
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,402
and you picked one that was almost right.

406
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,364
Jessie, she didn't predict your dad's death.

407
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,970
She thought she saw your death,

408
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,088
and she was wrong about everything.

409
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,443

You call down the spirits,
and they possess you,

624
