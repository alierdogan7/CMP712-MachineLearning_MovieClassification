1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
I've got the vibes.

2
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,120
This thing is evil, man.

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,520
I got a bad feeling.

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,200
Shut up and keep moving.

5
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,280
Is big mistake.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,120
Let it go, man.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,720
We set it down,
and we let it go.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
It's only a bloody monkey,
for christ's sake.

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Now pick it up.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,640
Listen,

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,320
you no pick up the cage,

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,600
you no get
the big dollars.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,720
Ooh!
Grr!

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Holy shit!

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,720
Don't move!

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,400
What are these buggers
playing at?

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,280
He says the rat monkey
must be set free.

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,360
He says we must leave
this valley

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,160
and never return,

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
or the evil spirits
will exact their revenge.

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,378
Unless we leave this valley immediately
they will split our bellies open

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
Is that so?

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,901
You tell these jokers that
I have the big rubber stamp

24
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,946
from the buff man in Palembang.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,518
Permit.

32
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:01,989
Look you see. Permit.

33
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,360
Permit!

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm a New Zealand
zoo official,

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,120
and this monkey is going
to Newtown.

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Oh! Aah! Aah!

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
No.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
No!

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Move it!

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Start her up! Quick!

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,320
Hey!

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
Wait!

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Drive, you buggers!

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Ow!

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,280
Man, wait.

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,520
Step on it!

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
The little bugger bit me.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Zingaya.

49
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Zingaya!

50
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
You've got the bite.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,040
There's... There's some
Dettol in the jeep.

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Aw, Jeez! No!

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
No! What are you doing?!

54
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Zingaya.

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
Oh, Jee... Oh!

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Zingaya!

57
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Thank you.

58
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,800
Hi, Paquita.

59
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Good morning, Roger.

60
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
That's the lot.

61
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,120
Tell your dad I'll be
round on Thursday

62
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
with the saveloys.

63
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,920
That's a pretty dress,
Paquita.

64
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
See you later,
alligator.

65
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,440
You like that boy,
Paquita?

66
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Shuffle the cards.

67
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,520
We will see
if you and roger

68
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,440
are destined
to be together.

69
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,640
Create his image
in your mind

70
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,560
and cut the cards.

71
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,160
Paquita,

72
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
I thought we'd seen
the last of this.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Whenever he come,
you start over again.

74
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
This...

75
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,200
Is you.

76
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,640
And this...

77
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Is the man
of your future.

78
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
But he doesn't look
like Roger.

79
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,640
It is not Roger.

80
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
There will be
one romance,

81
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,400
and it shall last
forever.

82
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Romance. Puh.

83
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
What about money?

84
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,200
This man will enter
your life...

85
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
in the near future,

86
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,880
and you will become...

87
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
romantically entangled
With him

88
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,680
almost immediately.

89
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,640
But who is it?

90
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,640
You will recognize
this man...

91
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,680
by the symbol...

92
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,720
of the star...

93
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and of the moon.

94
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
What is this?

95
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
Oh! No, not that one.

96
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,200
Paquita,
we have a customer.

97
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,760
It is bad, Yes?

98
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,320
Oh, Nothing.

99
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
Paquita!

100
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Uh, just dropping off
our order.

101
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Mum says to pack
the biscuits on top,

102
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,600
because she doesn't
want any broken.

103
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,880
Uh, actually...

104
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I'll take
one of these now.

105
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,360
Sorry.

106
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
Santa maria.

107
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,520
I better be off,
then.

108
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,640
Woman: Lionel!

109
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,640
Lionel!

110
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
Woman on radio:
Good morning, everybody.

111
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,960
Morning, Everybody.
well, Now I'd like...

112
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,640
There's a beetle.

113
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
Eh?

114
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,680
There. Under the fridge.

115
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Horrid little creature
scuttled right in front of me.

116
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,640
I thought I told you
to spray this house!

117
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
The place is infested
with vermin.

118
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,680
I'll get on it
straight away, Mum.

119
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Lionel!

120
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
You'll be pleased
to know

121
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,120
that your mother has been
voted treasurer elect

122
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,320
Of the W.L.W.L...

123
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
The wellington ladies
welfare league.

124
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,560
Ah, that's great, Mum.

125
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
And on Friday,

126
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,000
the president
Nora Matheson

127
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
is dropping by to offer
her congratulations.

128
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Wow. The president.

129
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,040
Oh, God!

130
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,000
Look at the state
of this place!

131
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,960
All the windows
will have to be polished.

132
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Woman on radio: Whiter,
brighter, cleaner wash.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,440
Look at this dust!

134
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,040
It's an inch thick!

135
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,840
You'll have to do
the silver.

136
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
I polished it
last week.

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
And the drapes
need cleaning.

138
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,240
Woman on radio:
Once a week, once a month...

139
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,600
I just mowed
the lawn.

140
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,360
Does this look like
a well-maintained frontage?

141
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Woman on radio: Very often
after drying the dishes...

142
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,320
Get up,
you stupid dog.

143
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,040
Here,
I'll help you.

144
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
No. I manage.

145
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Your brother usually does
the deliveries.

146
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,680
Not today.

147
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Ohh. Is big house.

148
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,960
You live here always?

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,840
Yeah.

150
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,440
You like my dog?

151
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
Is very big, Yes?

152
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,680
Any bigger,
and he'd belong in a zoo.

153
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,640
Zoo? Pardon?

154
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Zoo. You know.

155
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,680
Uh... Animals.

156
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Cages.

157
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,040
Claro.

158
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,040
I like to go with zoo.

159
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,360
I go with the zoo?

160
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,720
Oh, No. No, No.

161
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,360
You want to go
to the zoo.

162
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,680
Yes, Please.

163
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,520
Oh, Ok.

164
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,520
Tomorrow?

165
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
I'll meet you outside
the shop.

166
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Ok.

167
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,680
I have to go.

168
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,600
My jardiniere.
It's shattered.

169
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,320
Ah, Mum,
that was your favorite.

170
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,840
It wouldn't have happened
if you'd dusted carefully.

171
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,800
I can get you another one.

172
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,680
It's irreplaceable.

173
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,640
A present
from your father.

174
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,880
Our last
wedding anniversary.

175
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,160
Before...

176
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,000
He was taken from us.

177
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
I miss him, Too.

178
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Look.

179
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Cary grant.
He is such a dream.

180
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
I wish I could be
grace kelly.

181
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,200
She is so pretty.

182
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,240
Such beautiful
blond hair.

183
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Lionel?

184
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
what is wrong?

185
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,200
Uh, Sorry.

186
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,000
When I was young,
I was at the beach,

187
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,200
And I...

188
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,640
I nearly drowned

189
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
When I fell off
this pier.

190
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,640
Uh, My dad dived in
to save me, But...

191
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,640
As he was climbing out,
this...

192
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Freak wave just...

193
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Washed him out to sea,
and...

194
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
He drowned.

195
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,160
Oh, The little monkeys!

196
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Look, Lionel.

197
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
There! For you!

198
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
Poor little bugger.

199
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,680
You get out of there,
you vicious little shit!

200
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,680
Reckon they're only found
on one island, You know?

201
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
Story goes,
these great big rats...

202
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Come scuttling off
the slave ships...

203
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,680
And raped all
the little tree monkeys.

204
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,160
You know,

205
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,680
The natives use them
in black magic rituals.

206
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,720
Really?

207
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

208
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,840
Don't ask me how.

209
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,920
Probably suck the blood
of virgins, Eh? Eh?

210
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I want to sit down.

211
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,760
Holy shit!

212
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
Look at this.
It bit me.

213
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
I've been savaged.

214
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,560
And my dress.

215
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,840
Here. I help you.

216
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,240
Lionel...

217
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Take me home.

218
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,360
There you are, Vera.

219
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,200
Now you just rest up.

220
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,280
I'll be back
in a couple of days

221
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,800
To change
that dressing.

222
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,960
Thanks,
nurse McTavish.

223
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,240
It's all right,
Lionel.

224
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll see myself out.

225
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
Why have you
deliberately

226
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,200
gone out of your way
to upset me?

227
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm sorry.

228
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,200
It won't happen again.

229
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,960
I don't deserve
all this attention, Darling.

230
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,120
If you need anything
during the night,

231
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,320
you just call.

232
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,400
You're so good to me.

233
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Good night, Mum.

234
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Lionel!

235
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Hello!

236
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
Keep your voice down.

237
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,440
Look.
I have your jacket.

238
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,520
Yeah.
I'll get it tomorrow.

239
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
What?

240
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Look.

241
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,120
It could've waited
till the morning.

242
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,680
Is that all
you have to say?

243
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,680
Look, I'm really sorry
about the zoo, Paquita.

244
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,200
It's just mum.

245
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,480
She's...

246
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,240
You know.

247
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,800
I'd like to...

248
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,640
We go out again?

249
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,960
To a movie?

250
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,680
But it's not...
It's just not possible.

251
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
Look...

252
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Not possible?

253
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,640
But we are romantically
Entangled.

254
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,120
Entangled?

255
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,600
Oh, Look...

256
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Look, I don't know
What you're thinking,

257
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
But, Um...

258
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,840
I just can't see you
anymore.

259
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Oh, Paquita.

260
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,360
There will be
one romance...

261
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
And it shall last
forever.

262
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,040
Mum, what a beautiful day.

263
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,520
I'm gonna call
nurse McTavish.

264
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,680
No. You'll do
no such thing.

265
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,200
I'm perfectly
all right.

266
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
But...

267
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
You look after me,
Lionel.

268
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Nora Matheson.

269
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,520
Ladies welfare league.

270
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,680
Your mother's
expecting us.

271
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,560
The Mathesons are here.

272
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,320
No, Mum.
You're not well!

273
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Get my dress!

274
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,560
Jeez.

275
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,280
Please go back to bed,
Mum.

276
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,600
I'll put them off.
It's only the Mathesons.

277
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,640
It's the W.L.W.L.

278
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,360
Sorry.

279
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Careful.
It'll stick on crooked.

280
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,640
Ok.

281
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,800
Our...

282
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,040
Main objective
next year,

283
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,320
Is to...

284
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,840
Get the younger
generation

285
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
Involved
in the league.

286
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,000
That's why
I'm so pleased

287
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,200
That you're on
the committee.

288
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,200
Thank you, Nora.

289
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,440
It's a great... Honor.

290
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
H- Have you had
any thoughts

291
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
On the agenda for
the annual meeting?

292
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,680
Annual meeting.

293
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Annual meeting.

294
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,680
Ann...

295
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
Ann...

296
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,680
What we need's
another war!

297
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Yes, Dear.

298
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,800
I hear
Sir Edmund Hillary's

299
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,080
Planning an attempt
on the south pole.

300
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,280
Right you go.

301
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Have some more beans,
Mrs. Matheson.

302
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,800
I'll have
a few of those, Lad.

303
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,280
I really think
we should be going.

304
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
Thank you, Lionel.

305
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,880
What?

306
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,880
No pudding?

307
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,960
Only custard,
I'm afraid.

308
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Custard!

309
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,880
I haven't had
a good custard in years.

310
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,720
She never
makes the stuff.

311
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,320
Damn fine custard.

312
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Mmm.

313
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,400
Rich and creamy,
Just the way I like it.

314
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
Touchy on
the old food front, Eh?

315
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Never mind.

316
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,880
That was
a fine meal, Boy.

317
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Thank you,
Mr. Matheson.

318
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,080
Lionel!

319
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,960
What's wrong?

320
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,440
Lionel,
you must listen to me.

321
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Dark forces are amassing
against you.

322
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,640
My grandmama has seen it.

323
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,440
Say, "The path ahead
is one of fear

324
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,640
And great danger."

325
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,840
Eh?

326
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Fernando!

327
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Paquita, Wait!

328
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
God, Mum.

329
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,320
Oh, Fernando.

330
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Your mother ate my dog!

331
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Not all of it.

332
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Get nurse McTavish, Quick.

333
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,360
How long has your mother
been like this?

334
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
Since this morning.

335
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,400
Oh. I'll call
an ambulance.

336
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,720
You pack some things
for the hospital.

337
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,600
I'll do it.

338
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Nurse McTavish.

339
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Your mother's dead,
Lionel.

340
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm sorry, Lionel.

341
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,720
There was nothing
we could do.

342
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,000
She loved you very much.

343
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Which toothbrush?

344
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,640
Lionel!

345
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,160
Your mother's
toothbrush...

346
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,640
The white one
or green one?

347
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Green!

348
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Man on radio: Mother.

349
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,360
You are looking well today.

350
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,360
Woman on radio:
I woke up this morning,

351
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
How about
a nice cup of tea?

352
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,560
I'll just put the jug on.

353
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,720
Sorry, Mother. That
was your favorite teapot.

354
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
It slipped
out of me hand.

355
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Never mind that.

356
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Jacket,
nightgown, Slippers,

357
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,720
And toothbrush.

358
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,200
Where's your mother?

359
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,280
She's gone to hospital.

360
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,240
I didn't hear
the ambulance.

361
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,720
No, No.

362
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,280
No

363
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,720
She went
in nurse McTavish's car.

364
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,800
Sort of, Uh, Well,

365
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,200
Sort of lying across
the back seat, really.

366
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,720
Yeah. Her and nurse McTavish.
off to hospital.

367
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,200
But her night bag?

368
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
I'll take that.

369
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,640
Man on radio:
So, It's you

370
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
Who've been poaching
my rabbits.

371
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,000
Lionel.

372
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Man on radio:
I've a good mind

373
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,600
To let you have it
with both barrels.

374
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,880
Second man on radio:
it weren't me, Sir.

375
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,720
It were that Johnny
Morris what did it.

376
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,400
Well, I go now.

377
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,720
Man on radio: You just be
on your way, young lad.

378
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,480
If I see you here again,

379
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,480
I'll give you what for.

380
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
What do you want?

381
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,280
You're not
from the immigration?

382
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,200
I told you people

383
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,800
I lost
my bloody papers, Ok?

384
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,400
My family left Latvia

385
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,040
during the occupation.

386
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,600
We were hunted
like dogs.

387
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,720
I just want to buy some...

388
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
sedatives.

389
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,320
What do you think I am,
a goddamn doctor?

390
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,360
I don't sell sedatives.

391
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Tranquilizers,
I do have.

392
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,360
Do you want
a syringe,

393
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,400
or are you
going to sniff?

394
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Oh, Lionel,
I am happy to see you.

395
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,720
Tell me about these...

396
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,720
dark forces.

397
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,240
Death surrounds him.

398
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,560
There will be torment

399
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,520
and suffering.

400
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,720
You are marked,

401
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Lionel.

402
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,600
Lionel, if something
is wrong, I can...

403
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,760
Nothing's wrong, ok?

404
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,760
It contains the power
of the white light.

405
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,760
It will protect you.

406
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,720
Keep it with you always.

407
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,760
How is your mother?

408
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,400
Oh, Fine.

409
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,760
They want to keep her in
hospital for a few more days.

410
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,720
She ran
right in front of me.

411
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,760
They must have
discharged her early.

412
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
It was
a dreadful shock,

413
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
Losing Vera
like that.

414
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:37,760
Had lunch with her
only last Friday.

415
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,800
Picture of health.

416
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,760
That boy of hers,
where is he?

417
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Fine lad.

418
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Lionel called half a dozen
times in the last 2 days.

419
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,520
Very keen
to view the remains.

420
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,240
Of course,
I had to put him off.

421
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,840
It would have been
far too distressing.

422
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,680
As it is, It's been a damn
difficult embalming job.

423
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,960
Oh, My god.
Excuse me.

424
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,600
I can tell
you're not a Cosgrove.

425
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,760
You're far
too good looking.

426
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,680
Pardon?

427
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:23,760
Les is the name.

428
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm lionel's u...

429
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,960
Lionel's uncle.

430
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,640
And who might you be?

431
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Paquita Maria Sanchez.

432
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,440
Latin, Eh?

433
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,840
Excuse me, Father.

434
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,960
I am looking
for lionel.

435
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,560
I haven't seen him.

436
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,920
And if he's not here
in 10 minutes,

437
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,000
his mother will be delivered
into the hands of the lord

438
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,760
in his absence.

439
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Mortician: You idiot.

440
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,880
I told you to stay in there.

441
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,920
The embalming machine
should be turned off.

442
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Oh, Great!
Blowout!

443
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,680
Mortician:
You're a half-Wit.

444
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,760
This is coming
off your wages.

445
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I'll fix them up.

446
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,200
No, Leave it.

447
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,760
We've got to get the body
to the service.

448
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
The theme of
today's service

449
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Is the sanctity
of motherhood.

450
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,880
Vera Cosgrove
will be surely missed

451
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,680
by her friends
and grieving family,

452
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,320
for she was indeed
a fine woman,

453
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,760
and everything a boy
Could wish for in a mother.

454
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,320
Father McGruder: Lionel...

455
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,520
Though deprived of his father
at an early age,

456
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,760
was blessed with an abundance
Of mother love.

457
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Father McGruder:
Though our dear ones depart,

458
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,280
they live on in our hearts
and memories

459
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,760
Until,
in the fullness of time,

460
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,000
we, too, depart
from this world...

461
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,200
until we are reunited
once again.

462
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,040
A christian spirit
is eternal.

463
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Yea, whosoever believeth
in the lord jesus christ

464
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Shall be...

465
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Resurrected.

466
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,440
Poor Lionel.

467
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,000
He was always dreadfully
attached to his mother.

468
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,480
Well, I've seen some displays
of grief in my day,

469
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,520
but nothing
quite like that.

470
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,800
Do you need anything?

471
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,800
I'm fine.

472
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,480
I called
to see you yesterday,

473
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,560
But you didn't
answer the door.

474
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,760
I just want to be left
alone for a while, Ok?

475
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,240
At least he's
well provided for.

476
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,400
Yes, well, the Cosgroves
were hardly paupers.

477
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,760
He'll be the sole
beneficiary.

478
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Hey, guys!

479
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Look what I found.

480
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,240
What are you doing
with this thing?

481
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,880
Digging up a few stiffs?

482
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,000
L...
Shut up!

483
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,760
You know
What you are?

484
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,720
A bloody sicko.

485
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Yeah, mental.

486
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Get his wallet.

487
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,760
That's my mother
you're pissing on.

488
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,800
It's a zombie!

489
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,760
Mom, No!

490
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,040
What in God's name
is going on here?

491
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,760
The devil is amongst us.

492
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,760
Stay back, boy.

493
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,760
This calls
for divine intervention.

494
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
Yaaaaaah!

495
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,760
I kick ass for the lord!

496
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,760
There you are, Mum.

497
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,240
Void.

498
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Use the spoon.

499
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,720
Hey, Hey.

500
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,520
Cut that out.

501
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,720
Shh.

502
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,280
How's it going, Lionel?

503
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,280
Uh...

504
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:08,760
Come on, Mate.

505
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,880
I'm dying for a slash.

506
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,240
I've got a urinary infection.

507
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,760
Christ, What a stink.

508
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,160
Yeah. Dog
must have crawled

509
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,440
Under the house
and died.

510
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,960
Can't have been easy for you
these past few weeks, Lionel,

511
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
what, with your mother gone.

512
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,040
Who's that, Uh,

513
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,760
little girl
you've been seeing?

514
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,880
What?

515
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,560
You know,
the little latin number

516
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,760
with the cute bum.

517
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,240
Paquita.

518
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,840
Oh, Yeah, Paquita.

519
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,760
That's the one.

520
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,200
She's a bit of all right.

521
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,160
Wouldn't mind her
doing the growl on me.

522
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
So...

523
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,720
All this is coming
your way, Eh?

524
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,760
Of course, Uh...

525
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
Your mother
was always intending

526
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,600
to leave me a bequest.

527
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,560
Oh.

528
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,120
Oh, Yes.

529
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,080
We talked about it
many times.

530
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,760
It was a foregone
conclusion, really.

531
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,760
It's just, with her
dying suddenly,

532
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,240
she didn't get the chance
to include me in her will.

533
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,400
Well, you'll have
to talk to the lawyers

534
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,400
about it, uncle Les.

535
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,680
Don't bring the bloody
lawyers into it.

536
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,480
This is a private
family matter.

537
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,360
What the hell's that?

538
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,960
It's the pipes.

539
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,080
They do that sometimes.

540
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,280
It's not the pipes,
Lionel.

541
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,360
It's somebody
doing the business.

542
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,640
Please, uncle Les,
you just gotta leave.

543
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,680
So you found your dad's
old stag movies, Eh?

544
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,600
Yeah.

545
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,000
Is that the one
with the donkey

546
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,160
and the chambermaid?

547
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,080
No, please.

548
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,880
All right.

549
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,720
I understand,
Lionel.

550
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,000
Some things
a man prefers

551
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,240
to do on his own.

552
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,960
It's all part
of the grieving process.

553
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,040
Be seeing you, Lionel.

554
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,560
Man on radio: Nijinsky
was of what nationality?

555
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,080
Second man on radio:
Nijinsky is Russian.

556
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,480
Russian is right.
That's very good.

557
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,160
Um, 13.

558
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Number 13,
He's going for.

559
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,760
Lionel!

560
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,080
I dropped a shilling.

561
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,800
It must have, Uh...

562
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,960
Rolled down the drain.

563
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,160
I come to see you,

564
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,840
You shut the door
in my face.

565
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,040
You built a big wall.

566
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,040
I telephone,
and you don't answer.

567
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,920
Why?

568
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,680
Speak to me.

569
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,440
You don't want
to see me anymore?

570
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,440
It was a mistake.

571
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
Sorry.

572
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,320
Good-Bye.

573
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,720
Paquita.

574
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,800
Leave me alone.

575
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,880
I'm sorry.

576
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,320
Leave me alone.

577
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Take your hands
off her, you creep!

578
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,800
You know what they're saying
about you, don't you?

579
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,800
You've gone funny
in the head.

580
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,640
A real bloody weirdo.

581
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,200
You touch her again,

582
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,160
and I'll knock you into
the middle of next week.

583
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Hello. Hello.

584
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,960
How's cute little Selwyn
there?

585
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,800
Peekaboo.
Peekaboo.

586
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,800
So I said...

587
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,520
Yeah!

588
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
Hyperactive.

589
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,680
So, I tackled
this guy, right?

590
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,800
I brought him down
this real bone cruncher.

591
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,800
And the ball rolls free,
so I scooped it up,

592
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,560
And you know what I did?

593
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,040
I drop-Kicked
from 50 yards out.

594
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,840
Ha ha! God, You
should have seen it.

595
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,800
Put us 3 points ahead.
Gave us the match.

596
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,800
Fantastic.

597
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,880
Hello, Lionel.

598
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,800
That's quite a collection of
stiffs you got down there.

599
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,960
And I thought you were
such a quiet chappie.

600
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,600
Uncle Les, they're 
not what you think.

601
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,920
Back off, mate!

602
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,040
Lay a hand on me,

603
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,120
I'll have you
for breakfast.

604
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,800
I'm sorry, Lionel.

605
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,280
If I don't
report this,

606
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:38,280
I'll be an accessory
after the fact.

607
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,800
I hope they can keep it
out of the papers

608
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,800
For your mother's sake.

609
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,800
She always
hated a scandal.

610
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,600
This is hard
for me, Lionel,

611
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,120
Informing on
me sister's boy and all.

612
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,800
Of course, if I was
to keep me mouth shut,

613
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,520
I'd be taking
a hell of a risk.

614
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,800
Hey, Put me through
to the police, please.

615
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,280
Of course,
if I was to, Uh,

616
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,480
get my fair share
of Vera's estate,

617
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,760
I might be
more inclined

618
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,800
to protect a member
of the family.

619
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,000
You want the money?

620
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,800
Speak to sergeant Bauer.

621
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,800
I'd like to report
a multiple murder.

622
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,200
Yes, I'll wait.

623
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,240
The money and the house.

624
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,640
Blood is thicker
than water, Lionel.

625
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,080
Yeah, g'day.

626
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,840
Les about?

627
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,200
Hey, you bastard!

628
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,160
Thought
we'd pop over

629
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,320
And take a squish
at your new digs.

630
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,120
Yeah, mate. Why not?

631
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,920
Rip the skins off
a few brown ones.

632
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,240
Yeah. We'll make
a night of it.

633
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,320
Where are you going?

634
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:20,920
Just for a walk.

635
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,800
No, Mate. These people
want a feast.

636
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,680
We'll get a party going.

637
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,680
Let's get
some snacks, mate.

638
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,000
You got real-live
stiffs here?

639
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,520
Man: Hey, Les, let's
stick some real music on.

640
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,320
Oh, Yeah.
Comin' through, Buzzer.

641
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,640
Clear the dance floor.

642
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,680
I don't know
what sort

643
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,640
of kinky shit
you're into,

644
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,680
but I want
those things buried.

645
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Come on, Babe.
Have a dance.

646
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,760
It's no good asking Lionel.

647
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
He's nothing
like his old man.

648
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,040
He was a real stick man.

649
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,360
Used to pull the birds
like you wouldn't believe.

650
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,240
Don't talk about
my father like that.

651
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
Tasty.

652
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,160
You got anything else
that I can, Uh,

653
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,920
Nibble on?

654
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,800
So, You know,
I throw him a dummy,

655
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,800
Fooled him
completely.

656
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,800
Now, you
gotta imagine,

657
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,800
this is, like,
10, 15 yards out

658
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,520
from the sideline.

659
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,080
There are several
of these big buggers

660
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,400
coming towards me,
right?

661
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,320
So what do I do?

662
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,080
L... I put
my head down,

663
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,800
and I shot
to get a touchdown

664
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,560
right between
the posts. God.

665
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,920
The coach reckons
I'm a dead certain

666
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,160
For the next
callback trials.

667
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,480
What do you think
about that, Paquita?

668
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,800
You could be going out
with the next Bob Scott.

669
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
Where were you?

670
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,720
A cute little
Senorita, Eh?

671
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,160
Oh, God. Wait.

672
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,800
Oh, come on, now.
Don't be a party pooper.

673
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,280
Come and have a drink.

674
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,800
Oh, I bet you go off
like a rocket.

675
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,800
Oh! Oh! Little bitch!

676
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,400
I'll get you!
Where is she?

677
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,800
Aw, You foreign bitch!
I'll get...

678
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
Hello?

679
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Hello?

680
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Paquita!

681
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Paquita.

682
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,800
"Death surrounds him."

683
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Lionel: They're not...
dead exactly.

684
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,800
They're just...

685
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,560
Sort of rotting.

686
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,000
Nurse McTavish.

687
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,400
Father McGruder.

688
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,800
Your mother!

689
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,880
I don't know what to do,
You know? I...

690
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,880
Don't know how
To stop it.

691
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,800
You must destroy them.

692
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,280
I...

693
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,320
I can't.

694
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,600
Not mum.

695
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,680
That thing
is not your mother.

696
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,800
Come on, Les.
Join in.

697
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,800
I'll do it.

698
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,640
Aye, what's this?

699
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,240
Her lap bird's
flying the coop, is it?

700
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:02,920
Out of the way!

701
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,840
You're not going
anywhere, mate,

702
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,840
until the house
papers come through.

703
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,800
Come on, Lionel.

704
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,000
No, You don't!

705
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,800
Come on!

706
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,840
Rrrr! You foreign
animal bitch.

707
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,280
Time you and I got
better acquainted.

708
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,840
Help! Someone!

709
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,800
Please!

710
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,760
For God's sake, Run!

711
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,800
Not so loud, Mate!

712
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,840
Bitch!

713
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,840
Lmadre de dios!

714
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,720
Help us!

715
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,760
Bugger that!

716
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,840
Run, Paquita!

717
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,840
Help!

718
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,120
Help! Help! Help!

719
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,120
Oh, No! Shit!

720
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,640
Help! Help!

721
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,840
Please don't kill me.

722
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:35,840
It's ok. It's me.

723
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,840
That's a nasty plaque
problem you got there, mate.

724
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,720
Got a bit of a cavity
there, mate.

725
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,840
Mandy.

726
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,520
It's me, Rita.

727
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,560
Remember?

728
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,840
Ya mutant
little shit!

729
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,840
You'll be ok.

730
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,520
Let me in!

731
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,160
For christ's sake,
let me in!

732
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,440
Let me in! Help me!

733
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,320
Help!

734
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,120
Paquita,
we must.

735
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Come on! Help!

736
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,200
Quickly!

737
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,840
There's thousands of them!

738
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,760
What the hell's this?!

739
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,840
Leave her alone.

740
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,960
She's been bitten!

741
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,560
You know
what that means?!

742
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,320
She's gonna turn
into one of them!

743
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,360
I won't. I won't.

744
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,800
Help me!

745
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,200
You stay out of it!

746
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,800
I know what to do.
she's history.

747
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,920
I've read
the comics!

748
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,640
Total lobotomy!
Dismemberment!

749
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,920
Are you crazy?!

750
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:39,960
There's no room for
hysterical women in my unit.

751
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,840
Step right up,
you creepo bastards!

752
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,840
Lionel.

753
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,520
Paquita!

754
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,560
No!

755
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:16,040
Just as well someone around
here's got balls, Eh, Girls?

756
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,840
God damn little rug rat!

757
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,600
Get out of the way!

758
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Come on, you little maggot!

759
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,840
Where are you,
you little crawler?!

760
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,840
Lionel!

761
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,840
Holy christ. Vera.

762
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,840
Leave me.

763
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,480
Party's over.

764
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,880
Rita?

765
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,880
No!

766
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
Now, you just get
out of here.

767
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,880
What?

768
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,800
Haven't seen mum yet.

769
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,480
Come to mummy,
Lionel.

770
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,520
Come on!

771
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,240
No!

772
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,880
You don't
scare me, Mum.

773
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,880
All my life...

774
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,360
You told me nothing
but lies.

775
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,560
That stuff about dad,

776
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:42,600
none of that was true!

777
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,760
You drowned them both,
Mum...

778
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,080
Dad and that blond woman.

779
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,480
You caught them together,

780
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,880
and you killed them,
didn't you?

781
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,880
How dare you speak
to me like that?

782
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,880
Didn't you?!

783
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,560
Lionel, Help! Quick!

784
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,600
Slut!

785
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,760
Don't you touch her.

786
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,600
No!

787
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:44,640
No one will ever love you
like your mother.

788
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,800
No! No!

789
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,880
Such a good boy.

790
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,880
No.

791
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,880
The sign of love

792
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,880
has cost its toll.

793
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,880
The truth foretold

794
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,880
is now revealed.

795
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,880
Its mystery

796
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,880
Our destiny

797
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,880
The stars and moon

798
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,880
The sign of love

799
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,880
has come at last

800
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,880
Two Lonely hearts

801
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,880
are in the past

802
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,520
It blazes bright

803
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:12,720
Love's blinding light

804
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,880
through darkest night

805
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,880
and floods the room

806
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,880
The stars and moon

807
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,880
The sign of love

808
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,880
Our time has come

809
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,920
The stars and moon

810
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,880
Will shine for us

811
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:04,480
The stars and the moon

812
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,480
are guiding us

813
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,520
We follow the sign

814
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,880
to perfect love

815
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,880
The sign of love

816
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:53,120
Our time has come

817
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,880
The stars and moon

818
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,720
will shine for us

819
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,680
The stars and the moon

820
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,680
are guiding us

821
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,880
We follow the sign
