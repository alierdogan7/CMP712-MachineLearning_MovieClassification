25
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:03,460
Where is the chiropterate?

26
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,045
Inside.

27
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:08,256
This sword's getting dull.

28
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,344
It's not sliding out of the sheath
as smoothly as it should.

29
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:15,680
- Get me a new one.
- That's not possible.

30
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:20,352
We don't have time because we just
identified another one of them.

31
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:23,480
Swords of that quality
are not easy to get.

32
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,954
What the...?

33
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,708
This isn't a chiropterate,
did we get the wrong guy?

34
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,671
It just hasn't changed form
yet, Louis. Now, shut up.

35
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:52,676
Wait a minute. Isn't this supposed
to be within your jurisdiction?

36
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,387
That's a regular
human corpse in there.

37
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:58,723
I've already checked
the military personnel

38
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:01,976
as well as
the civilian employees involved.

39
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,688
- What do you mean?
- Hey! David!

40
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,482
(David) They've
infiltrated the public.

41
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,484
You want me to investigate this?

42
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,070
Dave! Take a look inside!

43
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,655
- Hey!
- Save it!

44
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:15,407
Oh, Jesus...

45
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,200
(Gasps)

46
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:19,369
(Grunting)

47
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:22,080
Wait! Saya!
Get ahold of yourself, now!

48
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,957
Not the same thing again.

49
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:27,836
Do you want to announce it
to the whole world?

50
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,921
I can't do anything about it.

51
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,007
You know the way it is by now.

52
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,594
The orders from the top are
to hunt them down, no matter what.

53
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:40,015
- (Muffled grunts)
- I really don't know anything.

54
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:43,476
(Groans)

55
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,064
It's all in there
and it's arranged accordingly.

56
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,816
You can go tomorrow.

57
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:53,278
I'll have your school uniform
and ID ready by then.

58
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,197
You better read through
the file carefully.

59
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,700
We know there's more than one...
Hey!

60
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,243
Hey, Saya!

61
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,705
Shit.

62
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,590
What the hell was that all about?

63
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,383
(Sighs)

64
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,052
You asshole!

65
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,137
What did I do?!

66
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,723
Don't ever piss her off again!

67
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,974
- But...
- Listen!

68
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:27,270
As far as we know,
she's the only remaining original.

69
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,273
Original?

70
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:18,655
So the tap was still running
when you found her?

71
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,742
Calm down.
You don't have to cry.

72
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,747
I'm not too sure,

73
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:31,793
but I heard Mari was going out
with an American soldier.

74
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:39,092
Mari from Charade's
committed suicide.

75
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:43,263
Stupid girl.
She didn't have to kill herself.

76
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,765
Maybe she's got the "clap."

77
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,227
You can't get upset
over a minor thing

78
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,938
if you're doing business
with American soldiers.

79
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:56,609
Did you hear about the suicide
at the base school last month?

80
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,863
There seem to be
a lot of them lately.

81
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,616
Apparently, everybody's
really uptight about it.

82
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,370
How terrible.
I hope this doesn't affect business.

83
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:12,042
It can't be helped if we're going
to make a living off the base.

84
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:19,257
It can't be helped if we're going
to make a living off the base!

85
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,418
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,234
Young lady...?

88
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,950
Aren't you Japanese?
You are not a student here, are you?

89
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,495
Did you pass through the office?

90
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:17,917
Hey, hold on a second!

91
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,297
Where is the principal's office?

92
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:26,051
(Knock at door)

93
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,762
Come in.

94
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,890
Sir, this young lady here...

95
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,767
Ahh, Saya. You're late.

96
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,770
I want you to say hello
to the principal.

97
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,108
Hello. You do speak English?

98
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,860
(David) Of course.

99
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:47,739
Well then, you can go see
some classes this afternoon.

100
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:52,535
But with the Halloween party coming
up we may not get much work done.

101
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,249
Thank you very much for your help.
Goodbye.

102
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,008
Who was that girl?

103
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,010
She came on an introduction.

104
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,013
She wants to join classes
for a few days.

105
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,558
- Um, excuse me, sir...
- Huh?

106
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,687
About the party tomorrow?

107
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,355
Not that again.

108
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,274
I thought we were over that by now.

109
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,820
Yes, sir, but it isn't long
since the terrible incident.

110
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:30,699
Have the students recovered
from the death of their friend?

111
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:35,286
That's why we're having this party.
I've had enough of this.

112
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,372
Now, get back to work.

113
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,129
(Children chattering)

114
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,968
What the hell is this outfit?

115
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:54,347
I'm not sure. It's supposed to be
a Japanese high school uniform.

116
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:58,309
At any rate, another fake corpse
was found here last night,

117
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,186
and it's the same pattern.

118
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,897
It's happening awfully fast.

119
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,608
I told you
there was more than one of them.

120
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:09,070
We'll never find them
once they go into hibernation.

121
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,407
We have to find them
before we get another corpse.

122
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,576
You just listen for them.

123
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,369
And get the sword.

124
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,080
(David) I know.

125
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,917
(Jet engine whining)

126
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,317
(Bell ringing)

127
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,527
All right, that's it for today.

128
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:52,447
Tomorrow we'll have
morning classes only.

129
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,367
- (Pupils cheer)
- I'm not through yet.

130
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,372
Those getting things ready for
the dance meet in the assembly room,

131
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,375
the rest of you can stay here
and get ready...

132
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,377
Hey, are you Japanese?

133
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,380
(Teacher) ..or old Pumpkinhead
will get you.

134
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,590
(Speaks Japanese)

135
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:13,593
Leave me alone.

136
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,261
Weirdo!

137
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:18,098
Come on, Linda, let's go.

138
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,396
(Sniffing)

139
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,919
So, this
is their "dining room", then.

140
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,142
Oh!

141
00:15:27,811 --> 00:15:29,354
Oh, you scared me.

142
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:33,233
What were you doing here?

143
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:36,444
Nothing. I thought I had a headache.

144
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,696
But it's gone now.

145
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,407
Oh. Wait!

146
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:45,120
Hold on a minute!

147
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,974
(Ceremonial band playing)

148
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:14,524
(Aeroplane engines roaring)

149
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,667
(Camera clicks)

150
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,700
(Bell ringing)

151
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:10,705
Come on, the band's
going to start any minute now.

152
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,461
- Sir?
- What is it, Sharon?

153
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:20,507
Aren't you going to put on
your costumes? What's the matter?

154
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:26,054
Linda told me she's not feeling very
well. It might be her anaemia again.

155
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:29,182
I thought I'd go with her
to the infirmary.

156
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:34,813
Again? Well, OK.
You don't need me, do you?

157
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:38,566
- No, sir.
- Join us when she feels better.

158
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,860
- You girls be careful, now.
- OK.

159
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:47,617
Are you OK?

160
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,828
It won't be too long.

161
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,039
(Band tuning up)

162
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,938
I'd like
to take it easy once in a while.

163
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:19,232
Especially on a day like this.

164
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,406
This isn't a very fun way
to spend Halloween, is it?

165
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:35,790
Don't worry,
it's only minor anaemia.

166
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,293
She should feel better any minute.

167
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:42,380
You should really try
not to worry too much,

168
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:44,883
and just enjoy the festivity.

169
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:48,428
What are you girls
gonna dress up as?

170
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:52,390
Witches? Vampires, maybe?

171
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:54,976
(Inaudible)

172
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,272
A-ha, here it is.

173
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:03,443
Mm? Sharon, what is it?
What's happening?

174
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,114
You...

175
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:12,285
(# Big band)

176
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,793
(Screams)

177
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,642
(Nurse and demon screaming)

178
