1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:18,550
Os iusti meditabitur sapientiam

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:18,550
The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:27,420
Et lingua eius loquetur indicium

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:27,420
And his tongue shall speak judgment

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:38,830
Beatus vir qui suffert tentationem

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:38,830
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:49,680
Quoniam cum probatus fuerit accipient coronam vitae

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:49,680
For when he hath been proved, he
shall receive a crown of life

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:02,150
Kyrie, ignis divine, eleison

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:02,150
Lord, fire divine, have mercy

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:14,170
O quam sancta, quam serena

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:14,170
Oh how holy, how serene

13
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,310
Quam benigma, quam amoena

14
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,310
How benign, how pleasant

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:28,010
O castitatis lilium

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:28,010
Oh lily of purity

17
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,160
We're both hungry, huh?

18
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Listen up.

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,120
Our target has an unidentified weapon
with a two meter radius.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,790
Unidentified? What the hell's that mean?

21
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,580
Its specifics are unknown.

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,660
Man...

23
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,300
The police are already working
on searching the city.

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,750
Once we receive the information,
we'll immediately head to the site.

25
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,270
Bandoh!

26
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,570
That's stupid!

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
What're you doing?!

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,380
The target is someone we can shoot
without warning, right?

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,010
Then it's hunt or be hunted.

30
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,220
It's one or the other!

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,210
Hurry up and drop me off!

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,290
Oh, right...

33
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:29,000
Since you looked sad she might have
thought that the seashell was bad.

34
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,150
What're you doing? It's not locked.

35
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,120
I thought this was a vacant house...

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,330
I moved in here today.

37
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,450
Excuse me, but...

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,890
We're the police.

39
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,560
We'd like you to take a moment to
cooperate with our investigation.

40
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,130
Did something happen?

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Have you seen a girl like this?

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,580
Did she do something?

43
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,250
Hey! We're the ones asking the questions!

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,150
Have you seen her or not?!

45
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,020
Cool it.

46
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,110
She's just a missing person.

47
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,420
Missing...

48
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,130
I don't know her.

49
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,570
I see.

50
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,870
If you see her, could you contact the police?

51
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,610
Thanks.

52
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,540
Let's go.

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,510
Okay.

54
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,420
Oh, I didn't lock the door.

55
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,170
This is Satoh from Bandoh Group.

56
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,470
We've arrived at Yuigahama.
We'll continue the search.

57
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,810
We're only authorized to search
the coastlines.

58
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,780
Please don't go places where
people are around.

59
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,840
That's up to our enemy.

60
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,350
They said that our enemy carries a special
weapon, but what do you think it is?

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,390
I don't know how to handle it if it's a weapon
we don't know anything about.

62
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,320
Shut up! Can't you keep your
mouth shut for a while?!

63
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,290
If you keep whining, I'll take you out first.

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,720
Leader!

65
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,860
Bingo!

66
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,640
Nyu...

67
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,280
Nyu?

68
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,190
Excuse me...

69
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,670
There's someone who's lost, and...

70
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,880
What're you doing in a place like this?

71
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,480
Geez...

72
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,950
You're shivering.

73
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,390
What'll I do with you? Here.

74
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
Nyu?

75
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,130
Now, stand up. Can you get up?

76
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,000
Nyu! Nyu! Nyu!

77
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,770
Oh, yeah, they're sticking out.

78
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,570
The horns are sticking out from her head.

79
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,510
You probably shouldn't get too close.

80
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,540
Shut up! Keep quiet!

81
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,200
What're you guys?!

82
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,590
Let's see now. It was okay to kill
witnesses too, right, Satoh?

83
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,520
No, we don't have any orders like that.

84
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,190
We should contact headquarters first.

85
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,990
What do you mean by kill?

86
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,130
You don't understand, dumbass?

87
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,530
Kill means I pull the trigger like this.

88
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,730
And, then, your brains'll splatter
all over and you'll die.

89
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,700
Nyu, run!

90
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,140
She's my prey.

91
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,080
Stay outta my way!

92
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,920
Nyu! Nyu!

93
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,330
Well, you're gonna let me
have some fun, right?

94
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,670
A missing person?

95
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,970
Around what age?

96
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,210
Well...

97
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,570
Yes. Yes.

98
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,540
Understood.

99
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,570
Oh, yeah.

100
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,480
Oh, well, I just remembered someplace
where she's likely to be.

101
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Sorry for bothering you.

102
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,190
Sorry that I had to step out
during the conversation.

103
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,790
No, that's all right.

104
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,730
Our missing person seems to be
pretty troublesome, though.

105
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,660
I was told that SAT's searching the
coastlines without asking us.

106
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,670
Geez, I don't get what they're thinking.

107
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,770
I don't want them to act too conspicuously.

108
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,770
Well then, I'm counting on you.

109
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,740
Yes, sir.

110
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,140
A vicious escapee.

111
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,710
A girl like this, huh?

112
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,330
Kohta!

113
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,400
Kohta!

114
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,870
Come on, Kohta!

115
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,380
What? What happened?

116
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,620
Oh! I'll call an ambulance right away!

117
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,850
Nyu! Where's Nyu?!

118
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,030
Kohta!

119
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,330
Hang in there!

120
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,490
Kohta!

121
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,760
It may be the wrong person.

122
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,390
She seems too different from
the person in the report.

123
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,720
Leader!

124
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,030
Have you seen any human with horns
sticking out besides her?

125
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,830
But...

126
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,070
This is Satoh at Bandoh Group.

127
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,810
We captured someone who
appears to be Lucy.

128
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,610
We're at Yuigahama.

129
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,720
Don't do anything without my orders!

130
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,350
Now the fun begins.

131
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,560
You've killed so many up until now, right?

132
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,620
Let's have a duel. A duel!

133
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,730
Nyu...

134
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,690
Hey!

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,510
What the hell's wrong with you?

136
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,130
You're a bloodthirsty killer, aren't you?!

137
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,640
Give me a beating, come on!

138
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,180
Hey, wait a second.

139
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,880
What'd you just hide?

140
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,350
Show it to me! Hey!

141
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,920
Could it be the lethal weapon?

142
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,990
Don't be stupid!

143
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,690
If you have the so-called weapon, bring it on!

144
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,750
Now!

145
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,430
I don't care any more.

146
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,710
Well, Leader!

147
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,040
Satoh, you can go ahead and kill her.

148
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,320
I said kill her. It's our job, right?

149
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,610
But...

150
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,750
Never mind, just shoot. It's an order.

151
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,720
Roger.

152
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,720
Sorry. This is my job.

153
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,440
Shit!

154
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,860
What the...

155
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,820
Leade...

156
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,550
What the hell are you?!

157
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,850
Is this for real?

158
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,890
A hand?

159
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,620
You're just trying to throw
stuff at me till you hit!

160
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,410
Throwing?

161
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,980
Our target has a weapon that causes
certain death within a two meter radius.

162
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,070
So that's it. Two meter invisible hands.

163
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,400
Those are your...

164
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,010
This is fun!

165
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,550
What is it?

166
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,240
Geez. This is too cool, huh?

167
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,580
Die! You occult bitch!

168
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,790
That's not fair, is it?

169
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,340
Are you enjoying this?

170
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,240
You damn bitch!

171
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,650
You bitch.

172
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,820
How dare you...

173
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,620
How dare you cut my arm off?

174
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,990
You bitch.

175
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,660
Just wait and see.

176
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,530
I'll never forget your face!

177
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,240
I'll kill you! I'll kill you, damn it!
I'll kill you!

178
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,240
This isn't fun anymore.

179
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,410
Nyu?

180
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,080
Where the hell'd you go?! I'll kill you!

181
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,620
Hey, where the hell'd you go?!

182
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,240
Come back!

183
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,250
Hey! Where the hell are you?!
Where the hell'd you go?!

184
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,950
Excuse me. What happened?

185
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,560
I'll fuckin' kill you! I'll kill you!

186
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,560
Excuse me.

187
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,860
I'll kill you! Come back!

188
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,150
Don't move!

189
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,730
Who are you?

190
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,230
I'll go get an ambulance now,
so please don't move so recklessly!

191
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,010
Shit.

192
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,750
Kohta!

193
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,950
Kohta!

194
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,260
Oh? Yuka.

195
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,890
Where am I?

196
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,670
What's going on? What happened?

197
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,300
Are you okay?

198
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,040
Please excuse us.

199
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,080
So we meet again.

200
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,050
Give us a moment alone.

201
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,560
A soldier with a machine gun, huh?

202
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,900
In short, you're saying that you
were attacked by some guys

203
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,200
like motorcycle gangsters
with model guns.

204
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,300
No, I'm not. It was definitely...

205
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,010
The girl who was here earlier said
she didn't see anyone like that.

206
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,500
If only there were another witness.

207
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,580
Witness...

208
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Nyu...

209
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,080
There was a girl at the beach.

210
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,780
Is she safe?

211
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,690
Who was she?

212
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,190
I don't know. I just happened to see her.

213
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,230
What were some of her
distinguishing characteristics?

214
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,390
Characteristics. I can't think
of anything in particular.

215
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,900
Things like hairstyle, age,
or something like that!

216
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,260
Especially if you saw something on her head!

217
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,900
Could you tell us just whatever
you remember?

218
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,340
I said it was a girl but she was about
the age of a college student.

219
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,780
She had short hair and was
a little overweight.

220
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,050
Okay, that's enough. Sorry to bother
you when you're injured.

221
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,290
I was told by the doctor earlier that
your injury isn't that bad.

222
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,990
Go home carefully.

223
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,660
But it really was someone
with a machine gun!

224
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,030
There are many motorcycle
gangsters around here.

225
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,630
We'll duly take care of your crime report.

226
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,640
You should forget about it,
for your own good.

227
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
I hope she hasn't been killed.

228
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,220
What? What did you say?

229
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,330
Nothing.

230
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,370
Then, I'll stop by again tomorrow.

231
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,040
Are you sure you're okay?

232
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,830
I'm fine, I'm fine. See you, then.

233
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,200
Nyu.

234
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,280
I'm sorry.

235
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,400
Nyu?

236
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,520
Thank you.

237
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,650
Nyu.

238
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,990
Kohta, please come again next year!

239
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,860
Don't forget about me!

240
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,460
Yeah! I'll come next year again,
Yuka, since I like you.

241
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,140
It's been eight years since then, hasn't it?

242
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,940
Yes?

243
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,610
No, nothing.

244
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,010
The key!

245
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,980
Sir!

246
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,260
Hey, who are you?

247
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,860
Those guys...

248
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,900
Those soldiers and the police are
definitely acting strange.

249
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,020
Nyu?

250
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,130
Even if I say something, I guess
you won't understand it.

251
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,870
But, I've decided that I'll never
let them take you.

252
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,110
All right, then, change into this.

253
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,510
Nyu?

254
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,980
Oh well.

255
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,780
I guess I've got no choice but to
change your clothes myself.

256
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,530
Uhm... Shirt, shirt, shirt...

257
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,500
There it is.

258
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,770
Okay, raise your arms, like this.

259
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,600
Nyu?

260
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,740
Don't worry.

261
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,530
I'm keeping my eyes closed, so...

262
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,870
Let me see...

263
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,310
Nyu!

264
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,510
Sorry!

265
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,580
Next is underwear.

266
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,880
This is the big one.

267
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,140
Listen. Don't move, okay?

268
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,690
There!

269
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,970
So it was a failure.

270
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,470
Yes. From the damage done
to the SAT members,

271
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,040
we could confirm that Lucy came ashore,

272
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,210
but we still haven't tracked her down.

273
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,510
I can't imagine that bloodthirsty
killer will continue to hide quietly.

274
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,540
That may be so, but I don't think
you need to even use #7.

275
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,660
What's her condition?

276
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,160
Since we've been performing pretty
severe experiments continuously,

277
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,150
I don't know if we can use her or not.

278
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,670
Papa.

279
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,830
It was already too cruel to describe
it with the word love.

280
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:51,080
It was a sad imitation created in a world
where only eternal pain and despair rule,

281
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,210
only to achieve a single goal.

282
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,860
Next Elfen Lied, Episode Three.
