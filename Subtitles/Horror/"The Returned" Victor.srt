1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,852
Previously on The Returned...

2
00:00:01,934 --> 00:00:03,728
Sorry, I didn't know you were in here.

3
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:08,191
I died, didn't I?

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,693
Where would we go?

5
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,656
We could go to California,
Paris, anywhere you want.

6
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:15,989
Let's be realistic.

7
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,617
This whole thing isn't realistic.

8
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,327
Hiding her here?

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,187
How long do you think
you could keep that up?

10
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,123
Hey, what are you doing out here?

11
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:25,542
Are you lost?

12
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,209
You must be cold. Where's your coat?

13
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,086
Come inside.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,256
He's family? What's the matter, Victor?

15
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,549
Cat got your tongue?

16
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,344
I know about the boy. I know what he is.

17
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,053
I told you, he's my nephew.

18
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,138
Prove it.

19
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:40,390
You crazy bitch.

20
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,558
You stay away from Victor

21
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,100
and you stay away from me.

22
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:45,854
I'm calling the cops!

23
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:46,937
Drop dead!

24
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,780
The little boy closed his eyes.

25
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:58,658
The fairy made him promise
not to open them again

26
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:00,702
until they were out of the haunted woods

27
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,872
and back safe and warm in his bed.

28
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,868
"I'll always watch over you," she said

29
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,142
and in the dark, she took his hand.

30
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,337
"Your wish is my command."

31
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,052
And so she grants his wish, every time.

32
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,465
Isn't she beautiful?

33
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,764
The fairy will always protect you.

34
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:33,434
Who is she, Mom? You never say.

35
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,144
You'll know her when you see her.

36
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,647
She'll send you a sign. Trust me.

37
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,987
You carry the weight of
the world in that head.

38
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:45,866
But now it's time to go to sleep.

39
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:55,945
Love you.

40
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:20,803
Shut up!

41
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:25,348
Check who else is in the house.

42
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:55,128
It's okay. Shh. Just stay where you are.

43
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,339
Don't let him see you. We'll be gone soon.

44
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:02,469
Sing a song inside your
head until we leave.

45
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:03,553
Try it.

46
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:05,848
Who are you talking to?

47
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,265
Nobody.

48
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:08,808
Don't screw this up for us, asshole.

49
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,065
Leave it. Come on, it's just a little kid.

50
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:17,817
No!

51
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:34,326

52
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:16,877
Help!

53
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,171
Stay here.

54
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,846
Help!

55
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:04,507
Morning.

56
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:07,385
Morning.

57
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:21,607
I think you're right... about moving.

58
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:25,569
What made you change your mind?

59
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:31,492
I woke up this morning feeling hopeful.

60
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:34,787
For a second, I thought
I was still dreaming.

61
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:38,499
Can we really make this work, Jack?

62
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,376
Yes.

63
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:48,885
Shane, hi.

64
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,861
What's going on?

65
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:51,998
Good morning, Mrs. Winship.

66
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,098
We're looking for your husband.

67
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:57,060
Hey, guys.

68
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,770
We'd like to ask you some questions.

69
00:05:58,853 --> 00:05:59,979
About Lucy McCabe.

70
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:01,731
Who's that?

71
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:03,066
She works at the Dog Star.

72
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:04,776
Why? What's going on?

73
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:06,903
It'll be better if we talk
about it at the station.

74
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:11,741
It's okay, I'll be back.

75
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:13,118
You want me to come with you?

76
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:15,578
No, no, it's okay, I got it.

77
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,289
Think fast.

78
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:20,666
Good catch.

79
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,296
There's a monster in the
attic, just so you know.

80
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:30,551
Sometimes houses creak.
It's called settling.

81
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:33,054
Or maybe it's mice.

82
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,808
Ah, okay. There's Mrs. Kurata.

83
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:39,435
Got to get going, kid.

84
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,020
Have a great day.

85
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,232
Bye.

86
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,859
Bye.

87
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,306
Is there something on your mind?

88
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,322
Just the wedding, all the details...

89
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,282
You know, it's got my head spinning.

90
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,992
Well, we could wait, you know

91
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:57,996
to get married

92
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,039
if it's bringing stuff up.

93
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:03,459
I mean, I'm the one who's
been pushing for it.

94
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,295
Maybe it's not the right thing.

95
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,798
You really think, as long
as we've known each other

96
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:12,677
that you could push me into anything?

97
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,973
I'm sure there are things I
still don't know about you

98
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:18,808
even after all this time.

99
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,356
I'm fine. It's just a mood.

100
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:26,149
It'll pass.

101
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,651
You sure?

102
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,780
Yeah.

103
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,163
Solano.

104
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,246
Yeah.

105
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:44,625
Okay. I'm on my way.

106
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,962
Go, go. Don't get caught up in me.

107
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:53,968
It's too late for that.

108
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:17,909
Hey. Hey.

109
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:27,543
Stop. Simon.

110
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,545
Simon! Stop.

111
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:53,361
Sorry.

112
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:03,037
I'm still trying to get used to you.

113
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:09,335
So many things I wanted to tell you

114
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,713
to share with you, and now that you're here

115
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:16,468
I can't think of a single one of them.

116
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:25,893
You're actually here.

117
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,404
You kept my guitar.

118
00:09:37,363 --> 00:09:39,157
I kept everything.

119
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,084
Do you know I still have a Facebook page?

120
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,211
People wrote the nicest stuff about me.

121
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:53,879
Yeah.

122
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,299
I used to look at it sometimes.

123
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,010
Why were the cops here earlier?

124
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,805
They needed your dad's help with something.

125
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,309
Nothing to worry about.

126
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:10,855
Your father and I have
been talking about moving.

127
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,067
But I just got back.

128
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,160
But this is my home.

129
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:28,247
Mom, I don't want to leave. I love it here.

130
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,707
I want to be near all my friends.

131
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,043
What kind of life will that be for you?

132
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:35,296
How will I know if you
don't let me find out?

133
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,261
You can't pretend to be Alice forever.

134
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,819
Mom!

135
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,281
Oh, my God! Lena!

136
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:02,823
Lena?

137
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,402
Is Jack on his way?

138
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,656
He's at the police station.

139
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,158
I'm not sure.

140
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,492
When did this start?

141
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,924
Right after she came back.

142
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,794
You think this is my fault?

143
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:47,502
You know it is.

144
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,333
I didn't do anything to you.

145
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,080
Of course you didn't. Lena, stop it.

146
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,478
Tell me what you think is going on here.

147
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,860
She's still all you care about

148
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,030
even when she's killing me.

149
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,293
Was it him?

150
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,508
I don't know.

151
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:41,178
I mean, that's two people
in only a few days.

152
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:46,183
We don't know they're connected.
Did you know your neighbor?

153
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,772
I knew her. We weren't friends.

154
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,902
Is there someone here?

155
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,043
Hey.

156
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,339
It's okay.

157
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,299
What happened?

158
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,759
Who is this?

159
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,138
Victor. He's been staying with me.

160
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,889
He was lost.

161
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,017
Listen, why don't you go to the bedroom

162
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,311
and wait for me, okay?

163
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,608
It's okay.

164
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,861
It'll be all right.

165
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,409
He was lost, as in you found him?

166
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:49,163
How long has he been staying here?

167
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,750
A few days.

168
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,335
Did you file a police report?

169
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,086
I went to the police station, remember?

170
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,464
No one was looking for him.

171
00:13:58,548 --> 00:13:59,674
So you just kept him?

172
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:02,426
Holy shit. Are you out of your mind?

173
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,928
You can't just take a kid home,
Julie, he's not a stray dog.

174
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,223
It's not like that. Please don't push it.

175
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,932
Don't push it?

176
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,686
You act like I'm busting you
for a jaywalking ticket.

177
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,479
This thing could be considered kidnapping.

178
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,398
Do you get what I'm saying?

179
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,692
Nik, you good?

180
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,777
Be right there.

181
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,698
It's my life.

182
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,368
Please, stay out of it.

183
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:32,206
Can't do that.

184
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:43,551
Does she know that I'm her real dad?

185
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,427
Yes.

186
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,806
Yeah, we told her everything.

187
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,017
Tommy wanted her to know the truth.

188
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,649
Has he been around the whole time?

189
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,614
Pretty much.

190
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,577
I couldn't have done that, you know.

191
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,997
Been with someone so soon if you had died.

192
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,502
I mean, I know that's a weird thing to say

193
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,211
but I know it.

194
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,590
You don't know anything.

195
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,050
You're still 25.

196
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:30,013
I want to be grateful you had someone

197
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,558
but I'm not.

198
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,520
Does Claire know about

199
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,604
your affair with Lucy?

200
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,858
We looked up Lucy's bank accounts.

201
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:24,819
The only big deposits were
all checks written by you

202
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,279
somewhere around

203
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,865
$20,000 over the last year.

204
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,700
That's a lot of cash.

205
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,702
Does your wife know about that?

206
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:34,537
Please, keep Claire out of this.

207
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,499
I get it.

208
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,834
Ahh.

209
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,251
You're in a midlife crisis

210
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,129
and along comes this 27-year-old

211
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:48,091
stone-cold fox of a girl,
and she likes you.

212
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,093
She thinks you're smart.

213
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,179
Then you realize that it's not real

214
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,264
and that kicks you in the gut.
It's humiliating.

215
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,727
Hell, I'd be pissed, too.

216
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,937
You know that your
small-change bad-cop routine

217
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,605
is embarrassing, right?

218
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,112
Did she admit that it was a con

219
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,867
the bullshit custody suit, the ex?

220
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,119
Or did you discover that on your own?

221
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:23,252
I know you've been through a lot

222
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:27,297
and there's not a person in
this town who doesn't know that

223
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,299
and I'm sorry for it.

224
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,802
Grief.

225
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:35,056
It twists people up.

226
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,725
Makes monsters out of them sometimes.

227
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:41,062
Maybe this girl brought
out some anger in you.

228
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,066
Maybe she deserved it in your mind.

229
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,319
Okay.

230
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,947
Well, let's just acknowledge

231
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,198
that she lied to me and
took a bunch of my money.

232
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,910
Whatever.

233
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,828
I cared about her.

234
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,622
How she felt about me, I don't know

235
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,707
but I didn't hurt her, and
I'm not gonna apologize

236
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,375
for something that saved my life.

237
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,473
Hello, there.

238
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,853
There's something wrong with your water.

239
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,021
Excuse me?

240
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:28,526
It all rises to the surface
eventually, doesn't it?

241
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,029
Are you looking for food?

242
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:32,656
Shelter?

243
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,284
I have a home.

244
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,203
But they changed the locks.

245
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:40,413
Well, maybe I can help you with that.

246
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,833
We haven't met. I'm Pastor Wright.

247
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,209
I know who you are.

248
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:49,297
I was at George's funeral.

249
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,841
Were you close with George?

250
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,471
I used to be.

251
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,725
He was my heart.

252
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:05,438
I heard your sermon.

253
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:07,732
You seem like a nice man.

254
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,196
Why would you lie to all those people?

255
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:15,699
Promising them an afterlife you
can't possibly know exists?

256
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:18,368
And you can't know it doesn't.

257
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:19,828
Oh, yeah? Want to bet?

258
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,831
Faith is the substance of things hoped for

259
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,583
the evidence of things not seen.

260
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:29,963
Whatever that means.

261
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:38,889
So, you really believe that
people rise from the dead?

262
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:39,973
Yes, I do.

263
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:45,062
Because I've been thinking about Lazarus.

264
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:49,107
Now, we all know he rose
from the dead, right?

265
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:50,901
But what happened after that?

266
00:21:50,984 --> 00:21:53,278
They never say, and I would like to know.

267
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:55,322
I mean, that's the
interesting story, isn't it?

268
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,867
Was he happy about it?

269
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,996
I have a feeling his
sisters weren't too happy.

270
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,291
Bet they weren't happy at
all when he came back.

271
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:09,336
It's just too weird.

272
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,256
And probably running around
the house, whispering

273
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,175
"This was a mistake.

274
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:18,220
"There's something not right about him."

275
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,848
And that something was,
is that Lazarus was dead.

276
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:24,726
And he should've stayed that way.

277
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:27,187
Lazarus' sisters begged
Christ to bring him back.

278
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:29,647
And that is my point.

279
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:34,194
He shouldn't have listened.

280
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,823
The finality's for a reason, Pastor.

281
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,743
Don't you think?

282
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:45,997
I mean, to just go on and on, it would...

283
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,671
Oh, that would be excruciating.

284
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:57,550
How do you organize a life
with no death to define it?

285
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:00,428
I really want to know.

286
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:04,599
The Caldwell Community
Center has a nice dormitory.

287
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:08,603
Can I help you find someplace to stay?

288
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:20,865
Victor?

289
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,980
Victor?

290
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,477
What are you doing in here?

291
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,648
Did you draw this?

292
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,945
Did you see something
across the hall last night?

293
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:48,328
Come on, you got to come out of there.

294
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,750
I don't know how to help you.

295
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:21,182
Do you think it's my fault,
what's happening to Lena?

296
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:31,870
Why would God bring you back

297
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,746
just to make the people
who love you suffer?

298
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,917
They've suffered enough.

299
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,893
Then why does she hate me?

300
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:44,229
I don't think she hates you.

301
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,066
Have you ever heard of survivors' guilt?

302
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,695
I died in an accident.
Lena wasn't even there.

303
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,532
Well, maybe that's why. She blames herself.

304
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,245
She was supposed to be on the bus that day.

305
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,498
That's right, but she wasn't.

306
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,501
Instead, she lost her sister,

307
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,462
the closest person to her in the world.

308
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:11,714
And the thing is

309
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,551
life forces you to keep on living.

310
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,553
It just does.

311
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,890
And joy returns.

312
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,937
Whether you think you deserve it or not.

313
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,649
It may take Lena a while
to come back from that

314
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,401
but I think she will

315
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,279
when she realizes you're here to stay.

316
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,157
Am I here to stay?

317
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,702
I think so.

318
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,162
I hope so.

319
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,169
Was your daughter in an accident?

320
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,129
Lena? No, never.

321
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,089
Could someone have hurt her?

322
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,591
No.

323
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,513
I don't know. She doesn't tell me much.

324
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,599
I have a teenager. I get it.

325
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,268
The thing is, what's on Lena's back

326
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,978
it looks like a puncture wound

327
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,147
like she was impaled on something.

328
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,316
What?

329
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,109
That doesn't make any sense.

330
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,112
And at the same time, it appears
to be spreading quickly.

331
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,823
Her body's turning on itself.

332
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,159
I can't say I've ever seen this before.

333
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,704
I have to ask, is there something

334
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,873
you're not telling us, Mrs. Winship?

335
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,292
Anything that could help
us help your daughter?

336
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,301
No, there's nothing.

337
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,514
What about her father? Where is he?

338
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,932
Can I talk to him?

339
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,269
I'll talk to him. Thank you, Doctor.

340
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,648
He put cameras in the ceiling?

341
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,609
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

342
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,360
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.

343
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,698
You have to get out of here.

344
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,952
Come with me.

345
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,288
You and Chloe.

346
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,958
This guy's not normal.
He could be dangerous.

347
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,001
No, Tommy wouldn't do anything to hurt us.

348
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,296
How can you say that?

349
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,842
Chloe,

350
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,761
don't be scared.

351
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,639
Who is he?

352
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,186
He's your father.

353
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,606
My father's dead.

354
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,774
He was

355
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,860
but he came back.

356
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,947
Is he an angel?

357
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,116
Yeah, he kind of is.

358
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,034
Can I touch him?

359
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,886
You're warm.

360
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,224
So are you.

361
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,486
We can't tell anybody about the angel,

362
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,572
not even Tommy, you understand, okay?

363
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,991
He's gonna have to go now.

364
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,496
But you'll see him soon, okay?

365
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,381
- Come with me.
- I can't.

366
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:42,967
Not right now. I have to talk to him.

367
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,471
He's been there for me since you left.

368
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,972
I need to hear his explanation.

369
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,683
Okay?

370
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,613
I'll be back soon, okay?

371
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,547
Right. Okay, well, thank you, Loretta.

372
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,257
I appreciate it.

373
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,351
There's no easy way to say this.

374
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:35,895
Jack is being questioned

375
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,314
in connection with Lucy McCabe

376
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,777
the waitress that was
stabbed in the tunnel.

377
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,152
He's a suspect?

378
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,574
- Apparently, yeah.
- They think Jack stabbed her?

379
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,746
Jack and Lucy were... involved.

380
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:56,082
Apparently, Jack gave
her money, a lot of it.

381
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,877
Where is this information coming from?

382
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,172
Well, I have a friend
at the police station.

383
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,841
Who feels totally comfortable

384
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,385
repeating this confidential
information to you?

385
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,512
I know you're trying to protect me here

386
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,099
but there is a level of respect missing

387
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,768
everywhere.

388
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,232
You're right.

389
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,568
I'm sorry.

390
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:57,977
Nikki's gonna take you to a better place.

391
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,981
There will be people who
will take care of you

392
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,942
who will be there all the time.

393
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:07,111
People who will help you.

394
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,115
I wish I could.

395
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,380
This is the right thing.

396
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,140
I'm so sorry.

397
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,245
Hey.

398
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:10,541
I came as soon as I could.

399
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:14,962
How's she doing? What's happening?

400
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,422
They still don't know anything

401
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:19,383
except it's getting worse.

402
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:23,261
They want to move her to a bigger hospital.

403
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:26,871
Where's Camille?

404
00:34:27,808 --> 00:34:32,517
The cafeteria, eating, again.

405
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:34,583
Aren't you worried somebody
will recognize her?

406
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,692
Let's talk outside.

407
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,969
I checked our accounts.

408
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,361
All the money from Camille's
college fund is gone.

409
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:14,787
She was dead.

410
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,956
And that money came from my family.

411
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,292
I just want to get this clear.

412
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:23,921
The money we saved for
our daughter's college,

413
00:35:24,004 --> 00:35:25,923
you spent on a hooker.

414
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:30,219
Lucy was not a hooker.

415
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:36,392
She said she had a gift

416
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:39,854
that she could channel dead people

417
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,354
talk to Camille.

418
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:46,235
Why do the police think you
two had a relationship?

419
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:48,695
Because she said that...

420
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,537
She said that we had to be
having sex for it to work.

421
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:00,749
And you believed that?

422
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,793
Come on, Claire, I was a mess.

423
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:05,378
I don't have to tell you that.

424
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:08,174
I lost everything...

425
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:10,425
Camille, you, Lena.

426
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:13,137
I would have done anything
to make that pain go away.

427
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,890
And it helped.

428
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,644
And I didn't hurt her.

429
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:24,731
I know you didn't

430
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:28,152
but this is the end.

431
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:30,653
I'm not going anywhere with you.

432
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:51,050
It's more comfortable than it looks.

433
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,133
I promise.

434
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:56,638
So, just let me know if you need

435
00:36:56,722 --> 00:37:00,600
- an extra pillow or...
- It's fine, not necessary.

436
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,770
I don't sleep anymore, anyway.

437
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:12,445
Will you excuse me for one moment, please.

438
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:13,739
Hi.

439
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,408
Well, this must be Victor.

440
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,326
Thanks for taking him in
on such short notice.

441
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,078
Well, of course. That's what we do.

442
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,746
Does Victor have a last name?

443
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:22,331
We don't know.

444
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:23,415
He hasn't told us yet.

445
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:25,583
Okay, that's all right.

446
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,586
A lot of cool people have only one name...

447
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:30,172
Zorro, Elvis.

448
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:31,757
Elvis actually had a last name.

449
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,259
Just pointing that out.

450
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:34,634
Thank you, Nikki.

451
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:36,220
Well, you have my number.

452
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:37,888
- Yeah.
- If he needs anything, call me.

453
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:39,651
Of course. We will take great care of him.

454
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:43,436
So, Victor, do you like games?

455
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:44,937
Because I got to tell you

456
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,398
we have an entire room full of games.

457
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,483
Helen, if you'll just give
me one more minute. Thanks.

458
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,736
Here we go.

459
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:18,353
- How much did you see?
- All of it.

460
00:38:21,939 --> 00:38:25,901
Do you know how disgusting
you make me feel?

461
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:30,781
Who are you?

462
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:33,409
I quit watching you for a long time.

463
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,457
But when you started acting
strange, I got worried.

464
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,751
I was afraid you'd hurt yourself again.

465
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,588
I'm an animal in a cage to you?

466
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:47,716
I was trying to keep you safe.

467
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,676
I didn't know how to help you.

468
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:57,350
I'm leaving. You know that, right?

469
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:59,935
Listen to me.

470
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:04,982
This guy who you made love to today,

471
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:09,111
he left you once, and he'll do it again.

472
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:17,953
Pastor Wright asked me to say
that it was an accident.

473
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:19,497
It wasn't an accident, Rowan.

474
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:25,336
Simon stepped in front of an 18-wheeler.

475
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,255
He killed himself

476
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:29,674
on the day that he was
supposed to marry you

477
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:32,761
knowing you were pregnant

478
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:35,388
and not caring that it would ruin you.

479
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,976
You knew that?

480
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,521
Given everything you were going
through, everyone thought...

481
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:46,274
Everyone?

482
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:52,947
Not everyone. Me.

483
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,783
Pastor Wright, he was counseling me.

484
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,660
So you just decided what I
could and couldn't handle?

485
00:40:01,414 --> 00:40:03,625
When we first met

486
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:10,339
when I told you that Simon was dead

487
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:12,091
that sound you made

488
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:14,218
it still haunts me.

489
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,011
I would've done anything to protect you.

490
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:18,931
You made a decision that changed the course

491
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:21,810
of my whole damn life, and
I didn't even know you.

492
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:26,104
I loved you the minute I saw you.

493
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:34,572
You do not want to touch me right now.

494
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:36,658
Don't touch me!

495
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:42,664
You are crushing me.

496
00:40:44,457 --> 00:40:45,542
I can't breathe.

497
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,628
Just get away. Get away from me.

498
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:19,613
Guys, if my dad catches
us, I'm gonna be so dead.

499
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:24,410
I'm sorry, Lena. That was so stupid.

500
00:41:24,493 --> 00:41:27,037
We'll just be a minute. Thanks, Abby.

501
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:30,499
You sure you want to do this?

502
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:32,917
I need to.

503
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,587
I can still feel her.

504
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:37,089
All right.

505
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,288
She's so cold.

506
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:12,415
Yeah, you probably
shouldn't be touching her.

507
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:31,809
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

508
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:40,653
They said, um, part of the bus

509
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:43,113
like, a metal part went through her back.

510
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,792
Hey, Lena, come on, let's go.

511
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:59,129
Don't touch me!

512
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:02,507
We did this. This is because of us!

513
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:13,995
Hey.

514
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:16,289
You okay, buddy?

515
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:19,980
You afraid of the dark?

516
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:26,758
You know what I used to
do when I was afraid?

517
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:30,512
I would sing a song inside my head.

518
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:34,474
You should try it.

519
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,392
You know, just pick a song

520
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:39,103
and then sing it inside your head

521
00:44:39,187 --> 00:44:41,897
until you fall asleep, okay?

522
00:44:43,692 --> 00:44:45,902
Good night.

523
