Let me out!

2
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,144
Why are you doing this to me?

3
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,523
Please. No.

4
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:10,226
l'm not a little piggy.

5
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,023
l'm not a little piggy.

6
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,335
l'm not a little piggy.

7
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:18,720
Help.

8
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:26,036
Let me go.

9
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,061
Help!

10
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,210
Help!

11
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:38,215
Help.

12
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,318
Let me out, please.

13
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,652
Help!

14
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:03,292
Woman: Ashville County Police
Department. What is your emergency?

15
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,929
- l was in a box.
- Tell me where you are, ma'am.

16
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,406
- l-- l-- l don't know.
- Just give me your location.

17
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,602
l don't know.

18
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:15,272
l don't. l don't.

19
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,578
Ma'am, are you still with me?

20
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,515
l don't know.

21
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,179
What do you see around you?
Can you give me any kind of landmark?

22
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,247
Dead people.

23
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,884
Dead boxes.

24
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,293
l woke up in a box.

25
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:34,663
Can you tell me where we can find you?
We'll send an officer out.

26
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,692
Ma'am, you must communicate.
Ma'am?

27
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:44,441
Try to stay on the line for 30 seconds.
We'll run a trace.

28
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,547
20 more seconds.

29
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:41,554
Hello?

30
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,998
Are you from the police?

31
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:15,931
Bring her out.
l'll take care of the little piggy.

32
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,845
Man: ls somebody in there?

33
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:50,127
Oh shoot, a locked door.

34
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,568
How'd you get in there?
Are you okay?

35
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:55,038
Don't you worry. l've got some keys.
l'll get you out.

36
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,033
- What?
- He's there.

37
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,066
No, ain't nobody here but me.
l'll get you out.

38
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,773
Don't worry.
Ain't nobody here.

39
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,246
He's there.

40
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:16,976
Man: Did you run out of gas?

41
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:22,014
l'd siphon you some of mine, but l'm pretty
much floating on empty myself.

42
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:31,255
So you got a name?

43
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:33,955
Probably.

44
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:36,430
My name's Tucker.

45
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:38,990
l work back at Schaffer's Mine,
back in the holler.

46
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,428
You ain't from around these parts,
are you?

47
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:47,932
l don't know.

48
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,104
Well, where you come from?

49
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,311
l mean, just now.
Where did you come from?

50
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,252
Where the dead people are.

51
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:00,653
Ooh.

52
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:03,351
That is quite a party, eh?

53
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:08,157
Dead people.
Oh, the cemetery.

54
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:15,168
Well, can you remember
where your car is

55
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:19,072
or someplace
l can drop you off at then?

56
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,939
Where the police lady is.

57
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:25,845
lf you called 911 ,
that goes into the city.

58
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:28,110
The police lady will help.

59
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:32,518
Sorry, sweetie, but that's
a little over 100 miles from here.

60
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:38,251
Why don't you just tell me what happened?
Maybe we can get you a little help.

61
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:42,696
l woke up
in a dead box.

62
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:45,359
And a man tried to get me.

63
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:49,268
All right, all right.
Cindy's gonna know what to do.

64
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:52,535
Are you out of your mind?
We don't even know her.

65
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:55,099
She's probably one of them
crystal meth tweakers.

66
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:58,203
- Lower your voice.
- l will not lower my voice.

67
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,908
Have you seen
the way she's dressed?

68
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,416
lt wouldn't surprise me
if she was a prostitute.

69
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,817
Come on. She's pretty and all,
but l don't think--

70
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,481
Oh. Oh, she's pretty, is she?

71
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,386
l get it.

72
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,519
Cindy, don't go being judgmental.

73
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,258
Let's just go out and talk to her.

74
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:20,564
l need you to see if you can make
some sense out of her, okay?

75
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,366
Her old man probably
roughed her up is all.

76
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you.

77
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,556
Hey now. You must be--

78
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:51,930
l'm sorry, l didn't get your name.

79
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,999
Tucker tells me
he picked you up on the street,

80
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:59,439
that you were coming from a--

81
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:03,137
a cemetery? ls that right?

82
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,736
Wa-- water.

83
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:07,715
Oh, l'll get you some.

84
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:12,209
Listen, ma'am, l--

85
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,119
l heard what you said back there.

86
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:16,590
l'm sorry, l didn't mean it.
l just--

87
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:19,184
All l know is

88
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,752
my head hurts

89
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:24,356
real bad.

90
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:27,334
And l don't know where this is

91
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:30,304
or how l got here.

92
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:34,571
l can't think
of all the names, first off,

93
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:37,476
probably 'cause my head
hurts so bad.

94
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,481
l also know that l saw a man--

95
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:43,245
an old man get dead.

96
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:46,880
And another man tried to hurt me.

97
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,017
l woke up in a box also.
l don't know if he told you that.

98
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:56,455
So for all l know, l'm already dead.

99
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:59,330
Oh, who's dead?

100
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:10,469
l want to go to the police lady's
house now.

101
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,108
Oh, hon, all we got is that truck
and this genius here ran it out of gas.

102
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:18,415
We can use the telephone
and get more gas.

103
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,183
And then the police lady
can come get me.

104
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,316
Oh, sweetie, our phone got
cut off two months ago.

105
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:25,053
We didn't use it no how.

106
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,061
My brother will be here in the morning
with his truck.

107
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,393
No. No.

108
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,161
Somebody needs to know
about the old man.

109
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,828
Tucker: Well, you don't even know
where he was.

110
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:38,032
There's lots of cemeteries
around here

111
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,166
and my truck ain't got
but a couple of miles on him.

112
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:43,143
Look, l'll tell you what--
you take a shower.

113
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,908
We'll find you some clean clothes.
You can take a shirt of Tucker's

114
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:49,405
and l got some nice shoes.
They'll make you feel better, l promise.

115
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,578
And in the morning we'll take you
to the sheriffs.

116
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:54,054
You're safe here.
l'll even cook you breakfast.

117
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,023
You're safe here.

118
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,298
Still love me?

119
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,211
l love you more than anything.

120
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,721
l feel real mean about what l said
about her.

121
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:03,553
She's sweet.

122
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,356
l just hope to God
she leaves that guy.

123
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:08,953
Don't feel bad.

124
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,397
l think we're doing the right thing.

125
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,799
We're doing the Christian thing.

126
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:17,236
Just you keep it Christian.

127
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,706
Don't you go sneaking in there
when l'm asleep.

128
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,832
Yeah.

129
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,977
She definitely ain't dead.

130
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,994
Hey, baby girl.

131
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:50,368
l'm sorry.

132
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:52,270
Sorry.

133
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:56,335
Everything's gonna be fine,
l promise you.

134
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:58,403
lt's all gonna be okay.

135
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:26,449
Tucker: Hey.

136
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,958
Heard your foot tapping there, thought
you was dancing in here or something.

137
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,768
Let me take a look
at that back there.

138
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,948
Ow. l'm sorry.

139
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,951
That's all right. No, l'm sorry.

140
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:59,085
Be honest with us.

141
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,792
Did your old man do this to you?

142
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:10,599
Why did that man try to hurt me?

143
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:13,835
Some people's just rotten.

144
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:17,733
They're just ruined right from the start.

145
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:20,713
We're gonna go to that station tomorrow.

146
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:22,738
l promise you, they gotta have
some sort of list

147
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:25,115
that shows people gone missing.

148
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,552
Hey, l got an idea.

149
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:30,284
Since you can't
remember your name,

150
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:32,314
why don't we
pick one out for you--

151
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:35,487
- just till you get yours back anyway?
- Okay.

152
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:40,057
Try real hard. Maybe you can recall
something from when you was little.

153
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,075
Princess Gemstone.

154
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:57,846
l think l used to be friends
with Princess Gemstone.

155
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,820
All right, Princess.

156
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:05,814
Cindy should be whipping up breakfast
probably about 5:30.

157
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,349
You like bacon?

158
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,658
You're gonna like Cindy's bacon.

159
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:15,066
Get yourself some rest, okay?

160
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,127
See you in the morning.

161
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:25,006
Hey, Cindy.

162
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:28,978
Cindy?

163
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:32,008
Cindy, come on.
l locked myself out.

164
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:41,217
Cindy?

165
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,490
Honey.

166
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,192
Oh, God Jesus.

167
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,332
No! Cindy!

168
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,838
lt really hurts.

169
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:57,866
What do you want?

170
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,507
Tucker.

171
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:04,778
No.

172
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:07,013
No! No no.

173
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,784
He's gonna kill her.
He's gonna cut her.

174
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,724
What? God!

175
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:14,750
Take me. Kill me.

176
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:16,262
Kill me, you fuck.

177
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:25,962
No, please.
He's gonna kill us all.

178
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,600
No, don't look. No.

179
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,211
Please go. Go!

180
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:35,237
Don't look. Don't look.

181
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,943
Go go.

182
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,951
No! No!

183
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:07,770
Why are we out here, Johnny?

184
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:10,647
We could have stayed home
for some lovin'.

185
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,811
- His truck's gone.
- So?

186
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,248
Baby, l'm all emotional
and shit here.

187
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,421
What did you drag me out of bed
in the middle of the night for?

188
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:25,022
Look, l saw Tucker with some
black-headed girl

189
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,055
heading down Route 28.

190
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:29,159
You think he's cheating on Cindy?

191
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,535
l never figured Tucker for the type,

192
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,268
that lying sack of shit,

193
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,173
but l saw what l saw.

194
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:39,975
Now l gotta go in there,
l gotta wake my sister up and tell her.

195
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,878
Whose car is that?

196
00:19:43,438 --> 00:19:47,215
Crum-- crumskull?

197
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:50,052
Cromskill?

198
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:51,614
Maybe it's his whore's.

199
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:04,530
Baby, why don't you wait till the morning
when y'all ride to work together?

200
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,063
Hold on, Jamie. l'm dying to know
who this bitch is.

201
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,438
Shit.

202
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:25,487
Hell, maybe l should see
who you've been texting, mister.

203
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,892
Baby, you'd never cheat on me now,
would you?

204
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,138
Baby, l would never
cheat on you.

205
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:42,470
And l never have--

206
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:20,262
l know this is the worst thing,

207
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:23,792
but we have to find a telephone

208
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:25,862
and call the police.

209
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:29,498
Oh, God.

210
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:38,848
Wherever we stop's
where we're gonna be.

211
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,054
All right?
lf there ain't nobody home,

212
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,755
they ain't got a phone,
we're fucked.

213
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,782
Please.

214
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:50,523
Please, next house.

215
00:22:56,024 --> 00:23:00,336
Next house.

216
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,373
lt's kind of late, isn't it?

217
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:11,645
We need a telephone.

218
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:13,550
Really fast.

219
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,556
l don't have a traditional landline
per se.

220
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,393
But l have a computer.

221
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,858
Lock it.

222
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,869
What?

223
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,863
Can that get us the sheriff?

224
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:35,534
Yeah, l can send an email.

225
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:39,375
Yeah, mail and tell them
to send all the cops.

226
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,641
The police, huh? What for?

227
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:48,147
His wife just died.

228
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,180
l'm so sorry.

229
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,853
l know how you feel.
My mother just passed.

230
00:23:54,882 --> 00:24:00,127
Did she get stuck
with a big knife?

231
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:02,691
Did she get a knife st--? No.
No, she didn't--

232
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,204
ls that a question--?

233
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:09,697
A man with a shiny face--
he killed her

234
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:12,837
and an old man.

235
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,175
And he wants to--

236
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,546
- He had a shiny face and he--
- He wants to make me dead.

237
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:19,313
Fantastic. Great. Okay.

238
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,980
Will it take long?

239
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,354
ln this golden age of technology,
who needs a telephone?

240
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,795
Actually, it might just take a minute.

241
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,913
"Do you have evidence
of insurance fraud

242
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:01,722
or fraud committed
by an insurance broker or carrier?

243
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:05,788
Do you suspect or know
of illegal terrorist or criminal activity?"

244
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,026
No, make it go down.

245
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:09,057
Okay, scrolling scrolling scroll--

246
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,001
"Are you an eyewitness to any crime?

247
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,130
Are you willing to...?"

248
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,038
Yeah yeah, go on,
send over one of them mails.

249
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,406
Come on.

250
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,433
Okay.

251
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:21,675
"Help. Send many cops."

252
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:31,814
Okay, it's sent.

253
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,522
What are you doing there?

254
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:40,158
l'm trying to find out
some more information

255
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,792
about the guy.

256
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,464
You can find out about people
on this thing?

257
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:49,772
Let's see...
nothing on the "America's Most Wanted."

258
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:52,209
Here's a link to the FBl site.

259
00:25:53,368 --> 00:25:55,370
Oh my God.

260
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:57,849
What? What does it say?

261
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:00,216
l don't know.
l wonder if this is him.

262
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:03,688
The FBl believe over 30 women
from Florida, Georgia and Alabama

263
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:06,590
have all been taken
by this lunatic guy.

264
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:09,424
Yadda yadda yadda, "authorities believe
that the killer is Caucasian,

265
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,363
late '30s to early '40s,
probably an affluent citizen

266
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:15,095
like a doctor or a surgeon."

267
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:18,502
Well, if they ain't found them,
how do they know they're dead?

268
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:20,631
Did he happen to have
a video camera?

269
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,503
Something was blinking
on his shoulder.

270
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:27,810
lt's him.

271
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,781
Why do you reckon?

272
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:32,648
He videotaped all the girls' murders
and sent them to the police.

273
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:39,189
Where was the last girl took from?

274
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:40,521
Miami.

275
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:46,556
Make this thing look
for missing girls in Miami.

276
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,171
Hey.

277
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,572
You okay?

278
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,770
Yeah.

279
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,973
My stomach hurts.

280
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:37,243
l can't take all this death stuff
while l'm grieving.

281
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:40,445
- Stephen, you got a car?
- Of course.

282
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:42,546
l think we all go
to the sheriffs station.

283
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,887
lt could be too late by the time
city police get here.

284
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:48,257
No way. No way.
l'm not getting murdered tonight, thanks.

285
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:51,229
l got a funeral tomorrow.
l have a lot of stuff to do.

286
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,926
Someone has to stay here, right,
in case the cops come?

287
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,128
l think we're safer in a group.
Trust me,

288
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:58,694
you don't want this guy to come knocking
with you here alone.

289
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,228
l understand.

290
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,935
Look, he's probably already seen
my truck by now.

291
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:05,911
l think you're in this
whether you like it or not.

292
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,317
Can't this thing go any faster?

293
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:16,083
No no, l had an accelerator governor
put in for mother.

294
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,956
She was a bit of a speed demon.
lt won't go past 40.

295
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,862
That's it? That's all you got?

296
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:28,493
We're at a police station.
Why are we getting weapons?

297
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:34,262
Get the tire stick.

298
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,208
And l got some tire sealant.
Maybe we can jam it in his ears.

299
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:02,035
Hey, Sheriff Bates.

300
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:24,860
Stephen: Um, maybe--

301
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,698
Sheriff, are you there?
lt's Tucker Smith.

302
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,142
This is Sheriff Bates.

303
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,407
Yeah, Sheriff.
lt's me, Tuck.

304
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:39,245
l can hear you.

305
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:43,117
We got a crazy person here
and he's-- he's killed some folks.

306
00:29:43,142 --> 00:29:44,815
We need help.
Do you copy?

307
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:48,313
l hit him with my car.
He killed my deputy.

308
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:50,691
l'm locked in the supply closet.

309
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:00,835
Um, l think you guys are good, so--

310
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,780
Dead.

311
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:25,328
They aren't all dead.

312
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,994
Sheriff.

313
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:35,505
That ain't Bates.

314
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:38,007
Sheriff, tell me where you're at.
We'll come get you.

315
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:41,676
l'm locked in the supply closet.

316
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,172
l hit him with my car.

317
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:48,583
He killed my deputy.

318
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:52,153
l can do it, Mom.

319
00:30:56,882 --> 00:31:01,695
This is Sheriff Bates.

320
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,631
Stephen: Hey. Hey, we're good.

321
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,794
There's no sheriff in here.

322
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,611
- Come on!
- Come on.

323
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:31,852
Come on.

324
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:37,233
Hey!

325
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,130
Tucker: No no no no!
God damn it!

326
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:54,145
Come on!

327
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:59,087
Get back here.
Come on.

328
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:04,553
- Come on.
- He's coming. He's coming.

329
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:16,836
Princess: Go.

330
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,604
- Why did he have the camera?
- Just drive, Stephen.

331
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:24,079
l think we should go back
to his house

332
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:26,776
- and wait for the city cops to come.
- She's right. She's right.

333
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:29,081
You're both crazy.
He'll trap us in there.

334
00:32:29,107 --> 00:32:31,178
- How much gas you got?
- About an eighth of a tank.

335
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,918
Let's head towards town.
We don't stop for anything.

336
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:36,517
No no, we don't have enough gas
for getting into town.

337
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,550
We can go to the holler.
We can make the market.

338
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,120
No, we head towards town.

339
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:44,225
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

340
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,133
Stop the car now. Stop.

341
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:48,001
- No, we don't stop for nothing.
- Stop!

342
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:51,967
What?

343
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:53,476
There.

344
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,779
That's where l'm from.

345
00:32:58,203 --> 00:33:01,616
No no, l say we just keep on going.
There ain't no reason for us

346
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,052
to go inside there
and let him catch up with us.

347
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:09,753
l'm pretty sure l'd rather die and rot in hell
than go in there in these circumstances.

348
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:13,126
l have to remember something.

349
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,932
Stephen: Oh, Jeez.

350
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:28,039
Roll down the window.

351
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:29,409
Hold up.

352
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,675
We can't let her go in there
by herself.

353
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:36,117
She ain't thinking right.

354
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,917
l'm gonna sit here and keep a lookout.
You go with her.

355
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:43,552
- Go on.
- l can't.

356
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:44,788
Why not?

357
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,625
My ma's in there.

358
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:49,496
My ma's in there.
Her funeral is tomorrow--

359
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:51,523
today. l-- l--

360
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:54,366
l can't go in there
and see her like that.

361
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:56,703
l can't see her
all sewn up like that.

362
00:33:56,728 --> 00:34:00,073
l'll go with her.
l'm bleeding like a sieve anyway.

363
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:03,443
Pull the car around back.
Hide it.

364
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:31,154
Come on.

365
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,490
Come on, come on, come on.

366
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,063
Let's find someplace
to take a look at that arm.

367
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:41,929
He was right here on the door.

368
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:59,048
Good job, Princess.
l think you hurt him first.

369
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:22,207
Woman: l'm not dead!

370
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,976
Guys?

371
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:32,579
Why are you doing this to me?

372
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,180
Who's there?

373
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:39,087
Who's there?

374
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,123
All right, all right.

375
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:46,599
Hold your arm there for me.

376
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:56,742
You're gonna need
some stitches.

377
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:05,846
Where have
all the dead people gone?

378
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:09,013
l ain't got the foggiest.

379
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:19,832
He's gonna kill me, ain't he?

380
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:24,903
Hey, look at me.

381
00:36:26,462 --> 00:36:28,339
Nobody--

382
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:33,336
l mean, nobody else
is gonna die here tonight.

383
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,440
Yes.

384
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:53,164
Woman: l'm not dead.

385
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:56,499
You are too dead!
You leave me alone!

386
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,010
You're dead.

387
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,414
Mom, you're dead.

388
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,019
You're dead. You're dead.

389
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:25,559
Please don't scare me like that,
Mommy, please.

390
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,430
Hey.

391
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:47,454
Would you guys think l was crazy

392
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:51,455
if l told you that l saw
my dead mother

393
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,628
floating in a hearse out there?

394
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,197
Okay.

395
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:44,108
Hey.

396
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:48,717
Are you all right?

397
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:52,489
l'm breathing.

398
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:57,996
l got me a pistol in the house.
l didn't even think to grab it.

399
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,292
l'm just so stupid,
so goddamn stupid.

400
00:39:02,326 --> 00:39:06,103
Hey, it all happened so fast.

401
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:12,341
Maybe--

402
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,610
maybe l should have
stayed dead.

403
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:19,348
You wasn't dead, all right?
So stop saying that nonsense.

404
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:21,982
And it's a coffin or a casket.
lt ain't--

405
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:24,549
ain't no such goddamn thing
as a "dead box."

406
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:28,654
And dead people don't float around.
They're just fucking dead.

407
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:29,789
Hey, man.

408
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,300
l'm sorry, l just--

409
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:34,632
l guess l'm still
kind of confused.

410
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:37,798
Well, snap out of it.

411
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:49,516
We just gotta hold on
a little more than three hours, okay?

412
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,077
Why? What happens then?

413
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:55,090
Well, my brother-in-law, for one--
he happens then.

414
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:57,786
He's gonna be at my house
at 6:00 AM sharp.

415
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,817
But you're not there.

416
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,885
Right.

417
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,892
Just Cindy.

418
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:08,836
l can't-- l can't let him
see his sister like that.

419
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,203
We gotta go back.

420
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:13,071
We gotta cover her up.

421
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:15,372
l really don't want
to leave here.

422
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:18,710
l feel like if l stay a bit

423
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:21,238
l might remember something.

424
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:24,878
And l'd rather not move, ever.

425
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:28,219
Well, all right then.
You stay here with the girl.

426
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,919
The keys are inside here.
l'm gonna lock that door.

427
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:33,121
You make sure you don't open it
unless you know it's me.

428
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,635
Lock the door, please.

429
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:51,636
Great idea.
Make sure that's locked.

430
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,975
Whoa whoa.

431
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:58,111
Princess, you're not thinking clearly.
That is not a good idea.

432
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:00,519
We've got a few weapons, right?

433
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,150
We've got the tire stick
that you hit him with.

434
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,126
The stupidest thing
l've ever done.

435
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:08,561
We've got the knife
that Tucker found in there.

436
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:12,431
And we have this.

437
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:17,664
Okay, fine. Fine.

438
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:19,640
l don't understand.

439
00:41:19,663 --> 00:41:22,940
l think it's my turn
to take something from him.

440
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,621
He's strong. He's got a lot of stuff
to kill people.

441
00:41:43,654 --> 00:41:45,656
l don't know,
l'd say he has the advantage,

442
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:48,397
not to mention the car
which helps him a lot.

443
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:51,133
And he's probably got
a lot of gas in it as well.

444
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,199
Oh my God, what if he comes back
before Tucker does?

445
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:55,733
We'll be fine.

446
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,110
How? How?

447
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,714
Look,

448
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:05,345
you don't know
what it's like to wake--

449
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,879
wake up in that thing.

450
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:13,486
l must have a mom who loves me
and wants me home.

451
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,980
Stephen: lt's not Tucker, is it?

452
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:01,851
Princess: No, it's him.

453
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:05,289
Stephen: He's been there all along.

454
00:43:05,313 --> 00:43:07,384
Looks like we're gonna have to abort.

455
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:10,259
Flag on the play.
He's not coming in here.

456
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:14,756
Princess: No, we're going in there.

457
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:24,536
No. No. No.

458
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:16,425
Princess! Prin-- hey!

459
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:18,829
No no no no.
Over here. Over here.

460
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:21,858
Me. Me.

461
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,062
Hey hey hey. Me.

462
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:26,504
No no no. No!

463
00:44:38,873 --> 00:44:40,477
Princess!

464
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,121
Help me. Help me.

465
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:51,248
He's coming. Please help me!

466
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:53,657
Help me, please. Please.

467
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:56,127
Please help me. Please.

468
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,494
He's coming.
Don't let him put me back.

469
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:01,227
Don't let him put me back.
l want to go home.

470
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:03,394
Shh.

471
00:46:03,424 --> 00:46:05,097
- Please help me.
- l'm sorry.

472
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:07,003
- Help me!
- Shh.

473
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,505
No! No!

474
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:19,179
l'm sorry. l'll get us help.

475
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,751
No. No.

476
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:31,821
Help!

477
00:46:33,788 --> 00:46:35,699
Princess: No.

478
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:37,464
No!

479
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:40,164
No!

480
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,957
No!

481
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,111
Princess?

482
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:48,971
Woman: No!

483
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:51,033
No!

484
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:50,174
And there's these windows,
but they're kind of high up.

485
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,206
- l don't know where he is, so--
- All right.

486
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,050
All you had to do was watch her,
just keep her safe.

487
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,989
Don't blame me.
You're the one who yelled at her and left.

488
00:49:58,012 --> 00:50:00,390
l don't know, she said she had to
take something.

489
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,155
l don't know.

490
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,621
Come on, let's go.

491
00:50:16,864 --> 00:50:19,344
Princess on tape: Are you from--?

492
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:21,677
Are you from the police?

493
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:48,731
Son of a bitch.

494
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:04,922
Jesus Christ.

495
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:11,860
- Which one's she in?
- l don't know. l can't look.

496
00:51:24,265 --> 00:51:26,404
ls it her? ls it her?

497
00:51:26,434 --> 00:51:28,641
No. Sick motherfucker.

498
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,671
Come on.

499
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:40,056
Oh my God.

500
00:51:40,081 --> 00:51:41,754
- Come on, back there.
- Back there?

501
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:43,728
You've got to be careful.
l don't know if you hit him.

502
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:45,992
l hit him at least once.

503
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,966
Well, then where is he?

504
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:50,162
Oh, God help us.

505
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:52,965
Stay alert.

506
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:57,465
We're gonna find the girl first,
then we'll look for him.

507
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,603
This time l'll make sure
to put a bullet in his ass.

508
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,672
Jesus Christ.

509
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,309
Come on.

510
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,583
We're too late.

511
00:52:12,914 --> 00:52:14,916
- ls she dead?
- She's alive. She's alive.

512
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:17,486
Here, reload the gun.

513
00:52:18,586 --> 00:52:20,259
Hold on, girl.
We're coming.

514
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:34,778
Oh.

515
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,978
- Are you sure you hit him?
- l'm pretty sure.

516
00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:43,579
Pretty sure?

517
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,500
Hey.

518
00:52:57,525 --> 00:53:00,267
Come on, come on.

519
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:03,036
- Hey, Princess.
- We thought we lost you.

520
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,506
Guys,

521
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:13,109
we're out of here.

522
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,182
Wow.

523
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,622
Oh, hey, here l am.

524
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:26,163
Nobody's home.

525
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:41,343
- Oh, God.
- Look what l've found.

526
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:44,543
Fire that puppy up.
Call 911 .

527
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:48,315
Heck, l'm calling everybody.
Are you kidding?

528
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:53,254
This is one of those Chinese ones,
'cause it's really advanced, really fancy.

529
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,726
lf you use--

530
00:53:57,685 --> 00:54:00,131
- Oh, sugar.
- What now?

531
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,156
lt needs some sort of a password
to make a call.

532
00:54:02,189 --> 00:54:05,170
Jesus Christ. That figures.

533
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:09,207
- What do we do now?
- Die.

534
00:54:13,234 --> 00:54:17,011
No, D-l-E-- "die."

535
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:19,518
- Good good.
- Okay okay.

536
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:23,516
No, huh-uh.

537
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:27,751
"Coffin" or "casket."

538
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:29,227
Good good good.

539
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,752
No.

540
00:54:30,785 --> 00:54:33,732
No. Try the next one.

541
00:54:37,758 --> 00:54:39,760
No, still not good.

542
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:10,462
- l think l know what it is.
- All ears back here.

543
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:12,528
"Chrome skull."

544
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:23,270
Craptacular.
That was a good one too.

545
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:43,603
"Thank you for contacting
the 911 emergency website.

546
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:46,132
Your emergency is important to us
and will be handled in the order

547
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:48,702
it was received. lf this is a life-threatening
situation, please call 911

548
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:50,645
or your local law enforcement."

549
00:56:16,295 --> 00:56:17,899
We may have a problem.

550
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,937
Why don't we
just head towards town?

551
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,280
Hell, we got us a car. Ain't like he can
chase us now, right?

552
00:56:27,306 --> 00:56:30,412
Yeah, but my car is there.
He can use that.

553
00:56:30,442 --> 00:56:34,686
l hope to God he does, 'cause just like us
he ain't gonna make it far in your car.

554
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:36,818
The smartest thing for us to do
is to go to Moreland's.

555
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:39,352
We can stock up on bullets.
We can use the phone

556
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:41,228
and finally get some five-oh
on the way.

557
00:56:41,253 --> 00:56:44,132
Look, pop the trunk. Let me see
if there's anything else we can use,

558
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:46,158
maybe another cell phone.

559
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,630
Check the glove compartment too.

560
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:58,110
What do you see?

561
00:56:58,137 --> 00:56:59,741
Nothing good.

562
00:57:37,342 --> 00:57:39,515
Are you from the police?

563
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:51,362
Look here, it's not my fault.

564
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,734
l told you folks are starting
to complain

565
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:56,933
about the stink coming from there.
You understand me?

566
00:57:56,962 --> 00:57:58,532
Do you know what l had
to tell Bates?

567
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:01,511
l had to tell him l had no keys.
Do you know what he told me?

568
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:05,037
He'll be back in the morning.
He wants in.

569
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,209
You ain't gotta look, okay?

570
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:11,415
Okay, we just need
to lift these inside,

571
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:13,821
just get them inside.

572
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:15,587
All right?

573
00:58:15,614 --> 00:58:19,118
And this shit--
this shit ain't part of the deal.

574
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:20,653
You got it? Not at all.

575
00:58:20,686 --> 00:58:24,065
l ain't never had one of them
jump at me,

576
00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:26,091
never, not in my house.

577
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:28,731
You're supposed to keep that shit
up there.

578
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:33,072
Women's voices: Bring her out.
l'll take care of the piggy.

579
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:35,669
And the other piggy?

580
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:40,711
- Can you do this?
- l don't know if l can do this.

581
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:43,083
God damn you.
This is gonna cost you extra.

582
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:46,578
lt's gonna cost you
a whole lot extra, you understand me?

583
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:51,254
And l want you to get them all--
all off my land tonight.

584
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,786
God damn it.

585
00:59:08,734 --> 00:59:11,681
All right, now don't worry.
Don't worry.

586
00:59:11,703 --> 00:59:15,276
l gotta get the right key.
l'll get you out of there, don't worry.

587
00:59:15,307 --> 00:59:18,811
- l just gotta find the right key.
- Hurry up.

588
00:59:31,957 --> 00:59:34,904
- Oh, God.
- Come on, pull it together, man.

589
00:59:34,927 --> 00:59:39,307
He cut my mother up. l saw my mom.
He cut my mom. He cut her all up.

590
00:59:39,331 --> 00:59:42,210
How long is it gonna take
to get to the market?

591
00:59:42,234 --> 00:59:45,238
Please please, can't you see
what we're doing here?

592
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,510
Can't you give us a break?

593
00:59:46,538 --> 00:59:49,314
We ain't going to that market,
all right?

594
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,617
We're gonna hold out here
until dawn.

595
00:59:51,643 --> 00:59:54,180
Then we're gonna drive to my house
and meet my brother-in-law.

596
00:59:54,213 --> 00:59:56,659
He's got one of them phones
and it don't need a code to call.

597
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:59,629
Come on, get ready.

598
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:01,528
One...

599
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:03,965
Tucker: Put the camera down.

600
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:07,027
Would you put the camera down
and get in the car?

601
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:09,733
lf you ain't gonna help out,
just be quiet

602
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:12,935
When l come back
l want that goddamn camera.

603
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,577
Come on. Just don't look.

604
01:00:16,602 --> 01:00:20,015
- l can't do it.
- One, two, three.

605
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:32,192
lt's all right.

606
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:34,254
lt's dead anyway.

607
01:01:19,553 --> 01:01:21,999
Oh, no.

608
01:01:28,996 --> 01:01:31,442
Stephen: Where do you think
she's headed?

609
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:34,344
Tucker: She seems fit to see
them pictures on that camera.

610
01:01:34,368 --> 01:01:36,871
Stephen: l don't think
that'd be a good idea.

611
01:01:36,904 --> 01:01:39,578
Tucker: Come on,
pick up the pace.

612
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:41,484
lf we can make it back
to the funeral home

613
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:43,545
your car should get us
down to the market.

614
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:56,065
<i>Man on radio: # The Baptist Jesus
and the Catholic Jesus #</i>

<i># And the Jesus
up on Broadway... #</i>

616
01:01:58,726 --> 01:02:02,606
You reckon she can find the market
with that dash map thing?

617
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:06,407
Yeah, most likely.

618
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:10,848
Tucker: Does that mean
he can see where she's headed?

619
01:02:10,871 --> 01:02:12,248
Afraid so.

Honk-honk, honk-honk.

Where we are? We are...

645
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:39,516

at the fucking rave.

646
01:05:39,546 --> 01:05:41,822

647
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,648
Okay. Okay, l'll do it.

648
01:06:12,379 --> 01:06:17,590
But l should take this one inside
to see what kind to get.

Women's voices: This little piggy
went to the market.

l'm sorry about the speed governor.

lt's just l didn't want my mom
to get hurt.

653
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:47,264
She would fly through the holler
like a bat out of hell.

654
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,965
l promise you, pedal to the metal,
we'll get there.

655
01:07:13,683 --> 01:07:15,924
You got any more

No need to worry, my friend.
We have a lovely little lD.

That ain't it.

661

lt's the law.
Sunday-- no alcohol sales.

662
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:36,079
So you're telling me it's a dry county
and you got booze for sale?

663

lt ain't dry. lt's moist.

664
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:40,914
- Moist?
- What the fuck is moist?

665
01:07:40,943 --> 01:07:44,652
lt means we got rules.
l can get a big fine for that.

666
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:48,561
All right, dude,
let's talk turkey, okay?

667
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:51,394
l'm assuming that this place
is owned by your family, right?

668
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:52,923
-Yeah, my daddy.
- His daddy.

669
01:07:52,955 --> 01:07:55,367
- Shut up. So where is he?

670
01:07:59,896 --> 01:08:02,536
- Come on, man.
- Excuse me.

671
01:08:02,565 --> 01:08:04,738
- l just--
- Hey, baby.

672
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:07,577
l saw you outside
trying to get our attention.

673
01:08:07,603 --> 01:08:11,278
Here's the thing-- we don't want
to get trashed in the car.

674
01:08:11,307 --> 01:08:14,049
Tommy and l are getting ready to go
to Hotlanta for an all-week rave.

675

-You want to come with us?
- ...friends we're meeting there.

676
01:08:16,379 --> 01:08:17,983
Your dad's never gonna
know about it, man.

677
01:08:18,014 --> 01:08:20,722
She wants to come with us.

678
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,220
That's great. l think we gotta put back
the fucking beer.

679
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,162
Howdy, ma'am.
How are you doing tonight?

680

l can get for you?

682
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:44,650
l'll take one of those
little videotapes.

683
01:08:44,674 --> 01:08:46,676
What for?

684
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:49,952
You making a movie
or something?

685
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:51,981
Something like that.

686
01:08:52,014 --> 01:08:54,290
Well, is it gonna be
a good movie?

687
01:08:54,317 --> 01:08:58,026
l think that'll be it for me.

688
01:09:15,371 --> 01:09:17,248
No.

689
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:19,514
- Tommy: Oh, shit.
- Princess: No no no.

690
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:21,078
You shouldn't go.
You can't go out there.

691
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,522
What's going on?
What the fuck is happening?

692
01:09:23,473 --> 01:09:25,282
Princess: Don't go.

693
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,480
Shit.

694
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:32,453
This here is private property,

695
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,484
-You gotta go. You gotta go now.
- No no.

696
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:36,463
- Just leave me.
- Tell me what's going on. What happened?

697
01:09:38,555 --> 01:09:40,398
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

698
01:09:41,624 --> 01:09:44,537
Anthony, go call the cops.
Call the cops, come on.

699
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:48,702
lt's okay. lt's okay.
lt's all right. lt's all right.

700
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:50,233
Did you get 'em?

701
01:09:55,772 --> 01:09:57,843
l don't know what he looks like.
He's got a mask on.

702
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:01,816
What are you doing?

703
01:10:01,845 --> 01:10:04,325
- Lock the door. Lock the door.
- Do it.

704
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:07,351
Are you after that girl right there?
You think you're going in there to get her?

705
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:08,987
ls that what you think?

706
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,890
How's the dude gonna
get back in?

707
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:14,424
What do you not understand?
l will shoot you in the head.

708
01:10:14,457 --> 01:10:15,595
He's not.

709
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:18,303
Oh, shit.

710
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:32,980
- Hey, where are you going?
- Checking to see if that's the only way in.

711
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:34,283
Hurry up.

712
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:09,979
No no no, please don't go, please.

713
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:12,152
Shh. Anthony?

714
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:15,094
Anthony, are you all right?

715
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:22,497
Princess, let me in.

716
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:24,796
Anthony?

717
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:35,676
Me and Anthony-- we passed these guys
down the road.

718
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:38,311
l don't trust them.
We shouldn't let them in.

719
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:40,014
l trust them. Let them in.

720
01:11:40,043 --> 01:11:41,920
- Are you sure?
-Yes.

721
01:11:41,945 --> 01:11:44,357
- Princess, let us in.
- Princess?

722
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:46,826
Princess, let us in.

723
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:54,835
l'm so sorry.
l was so stupid.

724
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:56,859
What were you thinking, eh?

725
01:11:56,893 --> 01:11:58,133
- Who the hell are you?
- What?

726
01:11:58,161 --> 01:11:59,697
- ls that your car out there?
-Yes.

727
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:01,606
You passed us on the street.
Why didn't you stop for us?

728
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:05,044
Look at you. Would you stop?
You're walking with a fucking tire iron.

729
01:12:05,068 --> 01:12:08,277
- ls that your friend out there?
- No.

730
01:12:08,304 --> 01:12:10,306
Shit. Anthony?

731
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:14,380
l'm so sorry.
l'm sorry about the car.

732
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:16,412
lt's all right. lt's okay.

733
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,776
Anthony's gone.

734
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:43,340
There's just a lot of blood.

735
01:12:46,442 --> 01:12:48,854
And this.

736
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,796
We called the cops,
so they should be coming--

737
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:02,632
Yeah? Let me know
how that works out for you.

738
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,898
Listen up, y'all. We gotta find
anything we can to hurt this fucker.

739
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,035
We're holding our ground.

740
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:13,275
Someone would be coming up
pretty quick. The cops known we're here.

741
01:13:13,302 --> 01:13:15,213
l think it's our best chance.

742
01:13:32,755 --> 01:13:35,895
Look, man, l can't find anything.
All l got is this tire sealant.

743
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:45,872
They ain't got no .45s.

744
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:57,148
Hey, this is cyanoacrylate.

745
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,626
ls it good?

746
01:13:59,649 --> 01:14:03,290
The superest of all glues,

747
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:05,424
invented during the war

748
01:14:05,455 --> 01:14:07,935
to glue soldiers' wound together.

749
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,870
When l was 18
l was building a tank model

750
01:14:11,894 --> 01:14:14,397
and a tiny drop of this fell on my leg
and it burned and smoked

751
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:17,843
like nobody's business.
Then it fused a piece of my PJs to my leg.

752
01:14:17,867 --> 01:14:19,505
How did you get it off?

753
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:22,209
A doctor had to cut it off.

754
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:24,275
l still have the scar.

755
01:14:57,106 --> 01:14:59,677
Girl's voice: You didn't tell me
you were making a movie.

756
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,282
Stephen: Shit.

757
01:15:15,758 --> 01:15:18,261
- No, don't.
- lt's okay.

758
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:40,360
Shit.

759
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,092
No no no, you'll hit the ammo.

760
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:56,065
You go around front now.

761
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:58,044
And don't you leave
till she comes out that door.

762
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:05,051
Aw, screw it. Cover your eyes.

763
01:16:08,511 --> 01:16:10,218
No!

764
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:24,801
- Go with the kid.
- No.

765
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:27,000
- Go with the kid.
- No.

766
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:29,031
- Go on, go.
- No.

767
01:16:29,065 --> 01:16:32,046
No, you tried
and he's not gonna stop,

768
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:34,309
ever. Just let me go.

769
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:37,743
Just let me go.

770
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:43,117
lf things don't go my way,
you're somebody great.

771
01:16:45,815 --> 01:16:47,988
Don't you forget that again.

772
01:16:57,526 --> 01:16:59,528
No.

773
01:17:02,164 --> 01:17:04,201
No.

774
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:12,074
No.

775
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:20,520
Oh, God.

776
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:26,493
No!

777
01:17:41,737 --> 01:17:43,114
No.

778
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:48,485
No no no.

779
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:49,649
No.

780
01:18:14,704 --> 01:18:16,513
l know who you are.

781
01:18:16,539 --> 01:18:18,883
l know your name.

782
01:18:18,908 --> 01:18:21,218
Hey, guys, come on.

783
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:00,392
Nice place.

784
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:03,328
You buy or lease?

785
01:19:03,352 --> 01:19:07,596
Hey, you don't mind if l use your bed
before we use your bed, do you?

786
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,904
Not much of a talker, are you?

787
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:19,401
You don't mind?

788
01:19:32,915 --> 01:19:34,917
Come here.

789
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:39,431
Come a little bit closer.

790
01:19:42,357 --> 01:19:45,065
l'm not gonna hurt you.

791
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:50,905
Now l know you only paid
for a blowjob,

792
01:19:50,933 --> 01:19:53,436
but don't you want
a little bit more?

793
01:19:53,468 --> 01:19:56,540
Have you ever had
a Swedish blowjob?

794
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:08,724
Hey...

795
01:20:11,053 --> 01:20:13,363
you didn't tell me
you were making a movie.

796
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:16,494
That's gonna cost you
a little bit extra.

797
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:21,773
l don't mind playing, though.

798
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:00,612
Hey!

799
01:21:02,638 --> 01:21:05,209

800
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,277
l don't care anymore.

801
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:09,084
Come and get me.

802
01:23:55,977 --> 01:23:58,457
l love you more than anything.

803
01:25:26,983 --> 01:25:28,985
Where to?

804
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:37,330
Shouldn't we wait
for the cops to come?

805
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,431
l've waited.

806
01:25:42,932 --> 01:25:45,378
Where to?

807
01:25:47,137 --> 01:25:49,413
My friend Anthony is in there
and l can't leave--

808
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:52,443
l left a note.

809
01:25:52,475 --> 01:25:54,352
Where are we going?

810
01:25:57,547 --> 01:26:00,824
Atlanta?

811
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:02,887
Atlanta.

812
01:26:05,622 --> 01:26:08,330
