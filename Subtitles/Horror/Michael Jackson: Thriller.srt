1
00:00:57,644 --> 00:00:59,254
Honestly, we're out of gas.

2
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:03,978
So, what are we going to do now?

3
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:19,389
l'm sorry l didn't believe you.

4
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:21,637
Could l ask you something?

5
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:23,195
What?

6
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,056
You know l like you, don't you?

7
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,128
Yes.

8
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:32,116
And l hope you like me
the way l like you.

9
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,469
Yes.

10
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:36,424
l was wondering if...

11
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:39,583
you would be my girl.

12
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:43,020
Oh, Michael.

13
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:57,044
lt's beautiful.

14
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:58,980
Now it's official.

15
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:04,054
l have something
l want to tell you.

16
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,053
Yes, Michael?

17
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,755
l'm not like other guys.

18
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,330
Of course not.

19
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,861
That's why l love you.

20
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,048
No. l mean l'm different.

21
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,076
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,325
Are you all right?

23
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,195
Get away!

24
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,119
"Sheriff, he's over here."

25
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,852
"My God, look at that thing."

26
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:01,943
"Look out!"

27
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,039
Can we get out of here?

28
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,118
No. l'm enjoying this.

29
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:08,471
Well, l can't watch.

30
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,422
Excuse me.

31
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:12,970
"Scrawled in blood."

32
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,301
"What's it say?"

33
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,293
''See you next Wednesday.''

34
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,734
lt's only a movie.

35
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,864
lt's not funny.

36
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,302
You were scared, weren't you?

37
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,898
l wasn't that scared.

38
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,990
Yeah. You were scared.

39
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:52,779
lt's close to midnight

40
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:57,148
And something evil's
a-lurkin' in the dark

41
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,118
Under the moonlight

42
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:04,614
You see a sight that
almost stops your heart

43
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:06,750
You try to scream

44
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:11,146
But terror takes the sound
before you make it

45
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,141
And you start to freeze

46
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:18,343
As horror looks you
right between the eyes

47
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:20,748
You're paralyzed

48
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,396
You hear the door slam

49
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:29,975
And realize there's
nowhere left to run

50
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,784
You feel the cold hand

51
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:37,230
And wonder if
you'll ever see the sun

52
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,738
And you close your eyes

53
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,197
And hope that this
is just imagination

54
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:45,300
Girl

55
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:47,987
But all the while

56
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:51,083
You hear a creature
creepin' up behind

57
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,267
You're out of time

58
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:58,167
They're out to get you

59
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:02,166
There's demons closin' in
on every side

60
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,478
They will possess you

61
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,933
Unless you change
that number on your dial

62
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,703
Now is the time

63
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,117
For you and l
to cuddle close together

64
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:16,713
Yeah

65
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:20,531
All through the night

66
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:23,813
l'll save you
from the terror on the screen

67
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:26,279
l'll make you see

68
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,998
Darkness falls across the land.

69
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:45,720
The midnight hour
is close at hand.

70
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:49,242
Creatures crawl
in search of blood...

71
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:52,725
to terrorize
y'all's neighborhood.

72
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:56,881
And whosoever shall be found...

73
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:00,444
without the soul
for getting down...

74
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:04,661
must stand and face
the hounds of Hell...

75
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:08,990
and rot inside a corpse's shell.

76
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:42,047
The foulest stench
is in the air,

77
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,182
the funk of 40,000 years,

78
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,602
and grisly ghouls
from every tomb...

79
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,688
are closing in
to seal your doom.

80
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,373
And though you fight
to stay alive,

81
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:59,788
your body starts to shiver,

82
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:04,007
for no mere mortal can resist...

83
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:09,351
the evil of the thriller.
