You haven't had company in this house
since Mom died eight years ago.

I'd like you to meet him.

720
00:53:04,855 --> 00:53:06,493
I can't. I have plans.

721
00:53:06,615 --> 00:53:07,764
Michael...

722
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:11,767
Things will change around this house
when school starts.

Hey...

724
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:17,654
MAX: How you doing?
You must be Michael, right?

725
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,052
And you must be Max.

726
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:23,652
Right. How are you?

727
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:31,005
Well, you're the man of the house...

728
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:33,405
...and I'm not coming in until you invite me.

729
00:53:33,495 --> 00:53:34,723
You're invited.

730
00:53:35,775 --> 00:53:37,128

732
00:53:47,535 --> 00:53:49,412
LUCY: Oh, hi. I didn't hear you come in.

733
00:53:49,495 --> 00:53:52,293
MAX: Is it okay for the guest
to see the food before dinner?

734
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:55,811
You're thinking of the groom
not seeing the bride before the wedding.

735
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:58,363
Oh, yeah. I always get those confused.

736
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,732
MAX: Thorn sends his apologies.

737
00:54:00,815 --> 00:54:02,533
Tell him I'm walking again.

These are my dinner guests.

Edgar and Alan. The Frog brothers.

743
00:54:18,815 --> 00:54:21,090
I didn't know you were having guests.

744
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,531
If we'll be in your way, we can eat
some peanut butter in the kitchen.

745

No, no, there's plenty for everybody.

746
00:54:26,655 --> 00:54:30,045

LUCY: Boy! Somebody around here
has bad breath!

752
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:50,328
LUCY: Nanook, would you quit
breathing on me!

753
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:52,326
Nanook, get upstairs. Go on.

759
00:55:18,455 --> 00:55:19,854
Are you all right?

760
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,732
It's not cheese, it's garlic.

761
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:25,408
You hate garlic, don't you?

762
00:55:25,495 --> 00:55:28,328
No, I like garlic. It's just too much...

763
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:30,294
It's raw garlic.

764
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:33,046
Garlic? How did that happen?

765
00:55:33,175 --> 00:55:35,689

00:56:00,855 --> 00:56:03,085
Sam! What's gotten into you tonight?

779
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:05,246
I think I know what's going on here.

780

You do?

781

MAX: Yeah.

782
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:10,724
I know what you're thinking, Sam.
But you're wrong.

783

- I am?
- Yeah.

That's all.

787

You were so sweet to him.

00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:39,173
I don't know what got into him.
He's not like that.

795
00:56:39,255 --> 00:56:42,725
Kids Sam's age need discipline,
otherwise they run all over you.
