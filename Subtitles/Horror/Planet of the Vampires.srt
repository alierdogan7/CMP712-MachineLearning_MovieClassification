     HAVE BEEN SHORT-CIRCUITED. 

233
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,877
 ANY VISIBLE REASON?            

234
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:17,147
 ANOTHER MYSTERY?               

235
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:18,682
    WESS, WHAT CAN              
    WE DO ABOUT IT?             

236
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:28,792
I CHECKED THE TEMPERATURE.      
     SECOND LAVIC STAGE.        

237
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,360
             I'M NOT INTERESTED 
             IN THE TEMPERATURE.

238
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,529
                     CAN WE GET 
             ACROSS IT OR NOT?  

239
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,265
             WELL, IT'S PRETTY  
         DANGEROUS DOWN THERE.  

240
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,502
 THE ROCKS APPEAR TO BE FUSED   
    AND THEY'RE SOLID ENOUGH.   

241
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,037
                IF THEY CONTINUE
             ACROSS THE MARSH,  

242
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:45,909
         AND IF WE'RE LUCKY...  

243
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:46,943
             LET'S TRY IT.      

244
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,279
         CLEAR.                 

245
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:30,007
         IT'S OBVIOUS.          
         THEY FOUGHT.           

246
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:33,710
                 THEY FOUGHT AND
         KILLED EACH OTHER OFF. 

247
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:39,149
             JUST AS WE WERE    
                 ABOUT TO DO.   

248
00:23:39,216 --> 00:23:42,318
     NONE OF THIS--THIS MADNESS 
    THAT HAS TOUCHED SOME OF US,

249
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:43,620
                    NONE OF THIS
                 IS COINCIDENCE.

250
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,290
             THIS WAS PLANNED.  

251
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,392
                     BY WHOM?   
                     BY WHAT?   

252
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,362
AND WHAT ABOUT                  
THE OTHERS?                     

253
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,931
                 WE CAN LOOK    
                     FOR THEM.  

254
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,569
         POOR TOBY, ON          
         HIS FIRST TRIP...      

255
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:51,605
        THE CHAMBER'S LOCKED    
            FROM THE INSIDE.    

256
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:53,874
             WE'LL NEED A TORCH 
             TO BREAK THROUGH.  

257
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:56,276
I COUNTED 4, WHAT               
ABOUT THE OTHERS?               

258
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:57,711
THEY DON'T SEEM                 
TO BE INSIDE.                   

259
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:04,117
             LET'S TAKE A       
             LOOK AROUND.       

260

[Wess] THERE ISN'T ANYBODY      
IN THE UPPER CHAMBERS.

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,921
[Mark] AND WHAT ABOUT           
 THE CONTROL ROOM?              

262
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,289
     IT'S EMPTY.                

263
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:12,025
 LOOK IN THE DOME'S             
SECONDARY CORRIDORS.            

264
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,226
     ALL RIGHT.                 

265
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,678
     IN THE MEANTIME,           
WE'LL LOOK IN THE SECTIONS      

266
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:16,063
OF THE AUTOMATIC CIRCUITS.      

267
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,647
 NOW, IN CASE OF                
 ANY EMERGENCY,                 

268
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:24,738
WE MEET IN THE ATOMIC           
GENERATOR ROOM.

 FIND ANYTHING?                 

271
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,882
     [Wess] NO. THE ENERGY      
     SECTION IS DESERTED.       

272
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:37,166
LET'S CONTINUE.                 

273
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:40,837

DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR.

00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:58,004

    ELDON DISAPPEARED.          

459
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:36,108
AND THIS UNKNOWN ENEMY          
KEEPS GETTING CLOSER.           

460
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:37,710
[Karan] THE ENEMY IS ALSO       
    BECOMING VISIBLE.           

461
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:39,311
WHAT DO YOU                     
MEAN BY THAT?                   

462
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:41,480
        WELL, YOU SAW           
         SOMETHING.             

463
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,081
     SOMETHING NOT              
    QUITE IDENTIFIABLE,         

464
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:44,683
 OUT OF THE CORNER              
    OF YOUR EYE.                

465
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,386
AS IF IT WERE COMPOSED          
OF LITTLE GLOBES OF LIGHT,      

466
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,288
SOMETHING FLEETING,             
NOTHING DEFINITE.               

467
00:41:49,355 --> 00:41:51,891
 THE MINUTE I LOOKED AT         
 THE THINGS DIRECTLY,           

468
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,826
                 THEY WERE GONE.

469
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:54,894
                 [Sanya] HOW CAN
                 YOU EXPLAIN IT?

470
00:41:54,961 --> 00:41:56,161
                     [Mark]     
                 I DON'T KNOW.  

471
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:59,498
         IT'S POSSIBLE THEY'RE  
         AN ALIEN FORM OF LIFE. 

472
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,801
[Dr. Karan] THAT'S TRUE. THEIR  
 FORM HERE COULD BE BASED ON    

473
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:03,168
            A DIFFERENT PLANE   
             OF VIBRATIONS.     

474
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:05,103
                 FLESH-AND-BLOOD
             MEN CAN'T SEE THEM,

475
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:07,740
             EXCEPT OBLIQUELY,  
             AS YOU DID, MARK.  

476
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,876
     [Wess] THOSE STRANGE WAILS 
 WE HEARD COULD BE THEIR VOICES.

477
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,344
             THAT'S RIGHT.      

478
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:15,280
     WELL, WE'LL BURY           
     BURT TOMORROW.             

479
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:18,317
 ANOTHER TOMB WE HAVE TO LEAVE  
 ON THIS DANGEROUS PLANET.      

480
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:19,351
         SANYA?                 

481
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,053
                 I'LL BE RIGHT  
                 WITH YOU, MARK.

482
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,255
FIRST, I WANT TO REMOVE         
 BURT'S NAMEPLATE.              

483
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:45,744
    SANYA.                      

484
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:47,830
 SANYA, COME ON.                
 THEY NEED YOU.                 

485
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,476
OH, I STILL HAVE                
BURT'S NAMEPLATE.               

486
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:02,778
                GIVE IT TO ME.  

487
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,080
        I'LL FINISH THE RECORDS.
     YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH TODAY.  

488
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,448
             THANK YOU.         

489
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:12,330
    AAH!                        

490
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:13,381
         [Crash]                

491

         [Winds howling]        

493
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,373
                REST WELL, BURT.

494
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,126
         I'M SORRY WE WEREN'T   
            AROUND TO HELP YOU. 

495
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:02,431
     I PROMISE WE'LL TRY TO SEE 
    THAT YOU DIDN'T DIE IN VAIN.

496
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,999
     ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT       
            STAND AROUND,       

497
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,101
                     WE'VE GOT  
                     WORK TO DO.

498
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:31,159
        FEELING BETTER,         
                 TIONA?         

499
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,162
    BETTER,                     
     MARK.                      

500
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,666
 I SWEAR IT, MARK.              
I DIDN'T IMAGINE IT.            

501
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:38,834
                WESS?           

502
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:40,469
 I THINK WE'LL                  
MAKE IT, MARK.                  

503
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,804
 I'M BEGINNING TO GET ENERGY    
TRACES ACROSS THE INDUCTORS.    

504
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,106
            HOW MUCH LONGER?    

505
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:45,407
WE MIGHT BE READY               
 BY TONIGHT.                    

506
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:47,876
         GOOD. WE'RE MAKING     
    A LITTLE TOUR OF INSPECTION.

507
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:49,978
         CARTER SAYS HE SAW     
        SOMETHING IN THE VALLEY,

508
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,347
         SOMETHING SHINING.     

509
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:53,215
                LET'S GO        
             TAKE A LOOK.       

510
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:10,115
        [Carter] MARK!          
         COME HERE.             

511
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:12,384
         LOOK DOWN THERE.       

512
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,520
             THAT'S WHAT        
            I SAW SHINING.      

513
00:46:20,826 --> 00:46:22,994
             [Mark]             
 FINALLY, SOMETHING TANGIBLE.   

514
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:26,231
     THAT DOESN'T DISAPPEAR     
    WHEN I LOOK STRAIGHT AT IT. 

515
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,263
[Sanya] LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN    
    HERE FOR A LONG TIME.       

516
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:00,065
         LOOK HOW PITTED AND    
        SCARRED THE HULL IS.    

517
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:02,334
 [Marc] DOESN'T LOOK LIKE       
 ANY SHIP I'VE EVER SEEN.       

518
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,035
     [Sanya] DO YOU THINK       
 IT BELONGS TO THE AUREANS?     

519
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,838
[Carter] I DOUBT THEY EVER      
BUILT ANY SPACESHIPS.           

520
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:07,839
     IF THEY HAD,               
     WE WOULD'VE...             

521
00:47:07,907 --> 00:47:13,044
                 [Gasps]        
             LOOK, MARK.        

522
00:47:13,112 --> 00:47:15,247
         [Mark] IT'S 3 TIMES    
             THE SIZE OF US,    

523
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:18,517
                AND JUDGING BY  
             THE DETERIORATION  
             OF THE CALCIUM,    

524
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,985
                 IT MUST'VE BEEN
             HERE A LONG TIME.  

525
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:23,988
PROBABLY BELONGED TO            
AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.        

526
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:36,468
CARTER, YOU STAY HERE.          
KEEP YOUR EYES AND EARS OPEN.   

527
00:47:36,536 --> 00:47:37,769
                    RIGHT.      

528
00:47:37,837 --> 00:47:40,505
SANYA AND I WILL TAKE A LOOK    
AROUND INSIDE THIS THING.       

529
00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:44,909
 OH, UH, IF HE MOVES,           
 JUST CALL OUT.                 

530
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:46,144

                         SANYA, 
                     WHAT IS IT?

534
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,118
 OH, I...                       
 I GOT A SHOCK.                 

535
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:40,952
                         HOW?   

536
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,754
 TOUCHING THAT.                 

537
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,655
        [High-pitched buzzing]  

538

539
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:48,259
                    THAT MUST BE
                 OVER 200 VOLTS.

540
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:50,729
I WONDER WHAT                   
THEY USED IT FOR.               

541
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,565
                POSSIBLY IT'S AN
         ELECTRIC TORCH. THEY...

542
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,734
         HELD IT IN THEIR HANDS 
         AND IT BECAME LUMINOUS.

 TO HAVE BEEN COULD HAVE HELD IT

    WHO, TIONA?                 

682
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:45,705
                 BURT.          

683
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:49,108
         BURT?                  

684
01:00:49,176 --> 01:00:52,178
             EVEN THOUGH WE     
         BURIED HIM YESTERDAY.  

685
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:56,649
                I SAW HIM, MARK.
                I SAW HIM.      
                I SAW HIM, MARK!

686
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:59,218
IF ONLY I COULD BE CERTAIN      
OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.          

687
01:00:59,286 --> 01:01:01,320
             THERE'S A WAY      
            TO BE CERTAIN.      

688
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,166
YOU SEE?                        
IT'S INTACT.                    

689
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:15,635
                         [Tiona]
                 OPEN IT, MARK. 

690
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:31,651
         AH!                    

691
01:02:25,322 --> 01:02:26,822
[Meteor rejector sounding]

693
01:03:21,461 --> 01:03:22,896

                DR. KARAN!

01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:33,139
         SALAS AND KIR ARE      
         NOT IN THEIR BUNKS.    

695
01:03:33,206 --> 01:03:33,907
                HAVE YOU        
             SEEN THEM?         

696
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:34,541
                         NO.    

697
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:35,207
                HAVE YOU?       

698
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:46,085
                         SALAS! 

699
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:53,726

701
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:10,509

702
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:12,779
     JUST HIS BODY.             

703
01:04:12,846 --> 01:04:16,098
 I INHABIT THE BODY             
 OF YOUR LATE CAPTAIN.          

704
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:19,619
 AND I'M JUST ONE OF MANY       
 BEINGS ON THIS PLANET.         

705
01:04:19,687 --> 01:04:21,554
    MANY BEINGS WHO             
    ARE DESPERATE.              

706
01:04:21,622 --> 01:04:23,289
WE'VE BEEN IN TROUBLE           
 MANY YEARS NOW,                

707
01:04:23,357 --> 01:04:25,007
AND WE'RE FIGHTING              
TO SURVIVE.                     

708
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:27,059
WE ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL         
OF YOU TO KILL EACH OTHER       

709
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:30,029
SO THAT WE COULD                
TAKE OVER YOUR BODIES.          

710
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:32,031
YOU ARE OUR LAST CHANCE.        

711
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:34,467
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT OUR        
RACE CONTINUE TO EXIST.         

712
01:04:34,534 --> 01:04:35,735
             AT OUR EXPENSE?    

713
01:04:35,803 --> 01:04:39,121
IF YOU WERE IN OUR PLACE,       
 YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.          

714
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:40,439
        ON YOUR PLANET,         

715
01:04:40,507 --> 01:04:44,527
I KNOW YOU HUMANS HAVE FOUGHT   
AND KILLED FOR CENTURIES.       

716
01:04:44,595 --> 01:04:47,563
 DO YOU REALLY EXPECT US        
 TO BE ANY DIFFERENT?           

717
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:49,565
    WE CANNOT BE WIPED OUT.     

718
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:52,602
WE'LL STOP AT NOTHING.          
WE MUST FIGHT, NO MATTER HOW.   

719
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,069
 WE ARE A RACE                  
THAT EXISTS ON                  

720
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:55,971
A VIBRATORY PLANE               
DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.           

721
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:59,208
    OUR LIMITATIONS ARE         
    ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.         

722
01:04:59,276 --> 01:05:00,943
     OUR TECHNOLOGY,            

723
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:05,548
WE CANNOT BUILD ANYTHING,       
 SPACESHIPS LIKE THIS.          

724
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:08,016
 WE NEED SHIPS TO GET AWAY.     

725
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:11,421
    PERHAPS OUR SURVIVAL IS     
 POSSIBLE SOMEWHERE ELSE.       

726
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:14,156
 OUR SUN'S BEEN DYING,          
    AS YOU CAN SEE.             

727
01:05:14,225 --> 01:05:16,892
 AND THAT MEANS THE END         
 OF OUR SPECIES AS WELL.        

728
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,214
WE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO      
SUMMON YOU HERE FOR CENTURIES.  

729
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:23,950
 JUST AS OUR SUN HAD            
     NO MORE ENERGY,            

730
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:26,786
    YOU HEARD OUR MESSAGE.      

731
01:05:26,854 --> 01:05:29,222
    WE NEVER EXPECTED YOU       
    TO ACTUALLY RESPOND.        

732
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,490
     YOU MEAN, IT WAS           
     NOTHING BUT A LURE.        

733
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,126
     YOU WANTED US HERE.        

734
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:34,928
        THAT'S WHY YOU          
     SENT THAT MESSAGE.         

735
01:05:34,995 --> 01:05:37,997
             HAVE YOU TRIED     
         THIS TRICK BEFORE?     

736
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:39,498
         YES.                   

737
01:05:39,566 --> 01:05:42,202
        THE STRANGE SHIP        
     FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM.       

738
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:45,171
            AND I SUPPOSE YOU   
         NEED OUR DEAD BODIES?  

739
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:48,758
     NO. THEY MUST BE           
 WILLING ONLY TO SUBMIT.        

740
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:53,562
LOSE THEIR BODIES AS WELL       
 AS LOSE THEIR WILL.            

741
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,332
         WE'LL NEVER SUBMIT TO  
         A BREED OF PARASITES.  

742
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,834
OUR RELATIONSHIP                
WOULD BE SYMBIOTIC.             

743
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:01,621
IN EFFECT, WE                   
WOULD BE 1 BODY.                

744
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:04,490
     IT WOULD IN NO             
    SENSE BE PARASITICAL.       

745
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:06,125
    YOU'VE GOT NO CHOICE.       

746
01:06:06,192 --> 01:06:08,127
     EITHER ALL OF US           
     GO BACK TOGETHER           

747
01:06:08,194 --> 01:06:11,363
        OR NONE OF YOU,         
     NOBODY WILL GO BACK.       

748
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:13,066
     YOU WILL NEVER GET THERE.  

749
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:17,119
 YOU'LL SEE. WE WILL            
    GET THERE, MARK.            

750
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:18,871
 A CERTAIN REJECTOR,            
    VITAL TO YOU,               

751
01:06:18,939 --> 01:06:20,607
    HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY.        

752
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:22,374
YOU CAN'T LEAVE                 
WITHOUT IT.                     

753
01:06:22,442 --> 01:06:23,542
WE'LL RETURN IT TO YOU,         

754
01:06:23,611 --> 01:06:26,412
ONLY IF YOU AGREE TO            
TAKE US BACK WITH YOU.          

755
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,933
     ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE          
 HEARD ALL OF THE FACTS.        

756
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:34,887
    AND YOU'LL COOPERATE.       

757
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:36,956
         NO, NEVER.             

758
01:06:37,023 --> 01:06:40,376
    WE'LL GIVE UP OUR LIVES     
     TO SAVE OUR OWN RACE.      

759
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,050
     QUICK, THE GENERATOR ROOM! 

760
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:12,407
     WESS, YOU HAVE THE RED KEY 
     TO THE ATOMIC DETONATORS.  

761
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:14,610
                     HERE'S THE 
                     GREEN ONE. 

762
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:17,546
             I WANT 3 POUNDS    
                 OF PLUTONIUM.  

763
01:07:17,614 --> 01:07:19,615
WHAT ARE YOU                    
GOING TO DO, MARK?              

764
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:20,916
        THE GALLIOT'S GOING     
             TO BE BLOWN UP     

765
01:07:20,984 --> 01:07:23,719
     WITH ITS ENTIRE CARGO      
         OF LIVING DEAD.        

766
01:07:23,787 --> 01:07:26,455
     BUT FIRST, I'VE GOT TO GET 
     BACK THE METEOR REJECTOR.  

767
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:28,323
         WESS, HOW LONG WILL IT 
         TAKE YOU TO GET READY? 

768
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:30,525
I HAVE TO FINISH THE            
PHOTONIC IGNITION.              

769
01:07:30,593 --> 01:07:31,827
THE REST IS ALL SET.            

770
01:07:31,895 --> 01:07:34,529
GOOD. I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE.  
 YOU 2 COME WITH ME.            

771
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:36,365
WESS, AS SOON AS WE'RE OUT,     
     CLOSE THE DOORS            

772
01:07:36,432 --> 01:07:39,434
         AND THE BULKHEADS, BUT 
     KEEP THE SCREENS TURNED ON.

773
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:41,036
         AS SOON AS YOU SEE     
             US COMING BACK,    

774
01:07:41,104 --> 01:07:42,571
                    TURN ON     
                 THE IGNITION.  

775
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,240
             WE'LL WORRY ABOUT  
         REPLACING THE REJECTOR 

776
01:07:44,307 --> 01:07:45,941
                 AFTER WE'RE    
                 OUT IN SPACE.  

777
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:48,644
THAT'S TAKING                   
A TERRIBLE RISK.                

778
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:50,646
     YES. I WISH IT WERE        
             THE ONLY RISK      

779
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:53,015
                WE'D HAVE TO RUN
             BEFORE TAKING OFF. 

780
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:57,153
BUT THERE'S NO OTHER SOLUTION.  
 GO ON, GET THE DETONATORS.     

781
01:08:54,094 --> 01:08:56,028
TIONA, YOU STAY HERE.           
COVER OUR RETREAT.              

782
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:57,563
DON'T MOVE FOR                  
ANY REASON.                     

783
01:08:57,631 --> 01:09:00,866
AND REMEMBER, THE DANGER        
IS NOT ONLY IN FRONT OF YOU.    

784
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:02,668
15 SECONDS AFTER                
THE GALLIOT EXPLODES,           

785
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:04,503
IF WE HAVEN'T                   
COME BACK,                      

786
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:07,006
YOU RUN TO THE ARGOS            
AND TAKE OFF, UNDERSTAND?       

787
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:07,907
             MARK, I CAN'T LET--

788
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:10,175
THAT'S AN                       
ORDER, KARAN.                   

789
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,057
                     LET'S GO.  

790
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:35,534
            [Gasping]           

791
01:09:35,602 --> 01:09:37,603
         [Winds howling]        

792
01:10:01,128 --> 01:10:02,628
 [Loud hissing]                 

793
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,468
 THERE'S NOBODY HERE.           

794
01:10:42,536 --> 01:10:45,137
NOW, I WANT YOU 2               
TO STAY RIGHT HERE.             

795
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:47,273
             NO, MARK. YOU      
             WON'T GO ALONE.    

796

     MAYBE NOT, BUT YOU WON'T   
        BE THE ONE TO STOP US.  

912
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:52,984
            YES, I WILL!        

913
01:25:01,794 --> 01:25:03,795
[Meteor rejector sounding]      

914
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:16,291
             AH!                

915
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:17,525
         [Groaning]             

916
01:25:32,157 --> 01:25:34,259
     SANYA, WITHOUT THE         
     METEOR REJECTOR,           

917
01:25:34,326 --> 01:25:36,762
 WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE            
     TO REACH HOME.             

918
01:25:36,829 --> 01:25:38,630
                 WHAT DO WE DO? 

919
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:44,969
WE'LL HAVE TO LAND NOW,         
    ON THAT PLANET.             

920
01:25:45,037 --> 01:25:48,106
    I'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS       
    WITH A SPECIAL PROBE.       

921
01:25:48,173 --> 01:25:50,876
     WE CAN EXIST IN            
     THE ATMOSPHERE.            

922
01:25:50,943 --> 01:25:54,446
    IT'S THE THIRD PLANET       
 OF THE STAR WE CALL SOL.       

923
01:25:54,514 --> 01:25:56,080
 IT'S SO SMALL, IT'S            
     NOT EVEN MARKED            

924
01:25:56,148 --> 01:25:58,082
ON THE ASTRONAVIGATION          
 CHARTS.                        

925
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:00,652
BUT WILL IT BE POSSIBLE         
         TO LIVE THERE,         

926
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,154
             FOR US AND THOSE   
                WHO FOLLOW US?  

927
01:26:03,222 --> 01:26:06,558
IT'S MOST LIKELY A YOUNG,       
 PRIMITIVE WORLD.               

928
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:09,494
         BUT I THINK IT'LL BE   
            ALL RIGHT FOR US.   

929
01:26:09,562 --> 01:26:12,363
     [Sanya] I'LL ACTIVATE THE  
     LONG-RANGE TELESCOPIC LENS.

930
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:21,139
                     [Chuckles] 
             YES, I WAS RIGHT.  

931
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:24,409
     IT IS A PUNY CIVILIZATION. 

932
01:26:24,477 --> 01:26:30,231
     THEIR BUILDINGS ARE STILL  
     MADE OF STONE AND IRON.    

933
01:26:30,299 --> 01:26:33,768
                HOW WILL THEY   
                 ACCEPT US?     

934
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:37,805
        I HOPE, WELL.           

935
01:26:37,873 --> 01:27:49,211
         FOR THEM.
