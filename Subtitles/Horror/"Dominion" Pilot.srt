00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:17,768
I've asked to see him.

187
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:19,169
I'll tell him about us,

188
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:21,772
and I will get his permission to marry.

189
00:13:21,806 --> 00:13:24,742
But you still have to do
the knee and the ring thing.

190
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:28,612
It just so happens I
have a knee and a ring.

191
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:35,018
What?

192
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:37,521
Alex, he'll say yes. Trust me.

193
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,490
I know him.

194
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:43,627
You're my shield. You took a knife for me.

195
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:47,931
There is no me without you.

196
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,867
We're different, you and I.

197
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,301
Yeah, what?

198
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:52,836
You think you know him better than I do.

199
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:54,638
I know the system better than you.

200
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:56,273
Claire, the truck is ready.

201
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:58,709
We have enough supplies to
easily make it to Delphi.

202
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:02,112
Claire, they don't have numbers there.

203
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,148
Everyone is equal.

204
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:06,683
We could start a new life,

205
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,552
but it's got to be tomorrow night.

206
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,287
The city will be busy with the Jubilee,

207
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,989
and you could slip out.

208
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:15,025
But it won't come to that. He'll say yes.

209
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,496
But if he doesn't,

210
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:23,133
wherever you go,

211
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:26,370
I follow.

212
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,272
Okay?

213
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:41,552
What's your name, soldier?

214
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,855
Alex Lannon, V-2. The
House Riesen, AA Corp.

215
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,391
Alex Lannon.

216
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,893
It's against our law for you
to be alone with Claire, Alex,

217
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,696
so next time make sure

218
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,200
you're accompanied by another guard.

219
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:59,269
[Clears throat]

220
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:02,239
- Principate.
- Please, Claire, not you.

221
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,707
I'm still the same William

222
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,275
you played marbles with in this room.

223
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,779
Yes, and always be.

224
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,848
Yeah, maybe you should call me Principate.

225
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,917
It does sound much better
when it comes from you.

226
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:15,752
You missed services tonight.

227
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:18,755
- I was teaching.
- That's right.

228
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,392
You know, I admire your work
with Vega's less fortunate.

229
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:25,229
You of all people know how important it is

230
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:26,630
that our faith must be nurtured.

231
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:31,768
It must be kept like a promise.

232
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:34,404
It troubles me that so
many of Vega's citizens

233
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,941
have forgotten this simple truth.

234
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,713
Yes.

235
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:45,816
- Well, let us pray.
- Yes.

236
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,908
Hey, Bix.

237
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,576
What'd you do now?

238
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,912
I got on the wrong side of the peacock.

239
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,513
Riesen stepped in.

240
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,615
You should keep out of
anything to do with the tops.

241
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,150
Yeah, they're no different than us.

242
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,618
They just got a better number.

243
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,393
When's the last time you ate?

244
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:31,562
Here. I ate at the palace.

245
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,002
You want to know a secret?

246
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:42,806
One day, we're gonna live somewhere

247
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,342
where there aren't any numbers,

248
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,811
where we aren't told
what to do, what to eat,

249
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:51,448
where to sleep, and whom to marry.

250
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:54,351
One day, we're gonna be free.

251
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,821
- Promise?
- I promise.

252
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,698
Stay close the next day or so.

253
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,666
Something big's gonna happen,

254
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:14,004
and whichever way it goes,
you're coming with me.

255
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,650
- Consul.
- General.

256
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,219
Oh, lookee here.

257
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:30,754
I asked the horticulturist

258
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:35,359
to grow these on the agri-towers.

259
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:41,365
I never much cared for berries.

260
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:47,004
There was an angel attack on a soldier

261
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:49,873
outside the walls today.

262
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,675
Small group, three angels.

263
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,343
Easily destroyed.

264
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:57,581
Not all of 'em. One survived.

265
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,786
Don't worry. It's been taken care of.

266
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,122
But the archangel is concerned,

267
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,891
and you should be too.

268
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:11,128
Michael sees evil portent
in everything and everyone.

269
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:13,130
[Chuckles]

270
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,465
It was an isolated incident, nothing more.

271
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,102
No further sightings
on our long-range scans.

272
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:21,371
We deployed the drone.

273
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:24,941
All clear.

274
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,477
We don't want it getting out.

275
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,613
It could cause panic.

276
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,482
Perhaps that wouldn't be a bad thing.

277
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,385
We've done our jobs too well.

278
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,956
Vega has grown complacent, lazy.

279
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,228
So are you looking forward

280
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,664
to the announcement at the Jubilee?

281
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:51,168
Yes.

282
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,470
Tomorrow, then.

283
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,776
I've been guarding David
Whele for six months.

284
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:02,312
I finally saw what he
feeds that tiger of his.

285
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,481
It's not a tiger. It's a lion.

286
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,949
Is there a difference?

287
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,517
- Yeah, stripes.
- Whatever.

288
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:11,354
It gets steak for dinner...
dry-aged porterhouse.

289
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:13,123
When was the last time
you even tasted beef?

290
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:15,325
Cat's one of a kind. We're a dime a dozen.

291
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,127
Speak for yourself.

292
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,096
- Hey, boys.
- Both: Noma.

293
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,997
Hey, Ethan, can you weasel your way

294
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,532
into a bottle of Scotch for me tonight?

295
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,267
"Weasel"? Really?

296
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:27,337
- She means charm your way.
- Nooo... I mean "Weasel"!

297
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:29,206
[Laughs derisively]

298
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,108
You know what goes great with Scotch, Noma?

299
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:34,277
Porterhouse steak, and I can get some.

300
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:35,846
My gift to you.

301
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,180
Alex, I'll grab one for you too.

302
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:38,982
We're gonna eat like tigers tonight.

303
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:42,185
- Lions.
- Tigers.

304
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,954
You've been logging some serious overtime

305
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:46,056
- at House Riesen.
- I go where I'm told.

306
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,860
So General Riesen's just
decided to tighten security?

307
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,696
Why wouldn't he? He's lord of the city.

308
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,498
The man's concerned about
his daughter's safety.

309
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,200
Who said anything about his daughter?

310
00:19:57,235 --> 00:19:58,702
No one.

311
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,138
It's just you know how he is about Claire.

312
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:04,407
Yeah.

313
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,009
He cares a lot about her, doesn't he?

314
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:09,045
[Mechanical whirring]

315
00:20:24,362 --> 00:20:25,729
Don't the Wheles ever sleep?

316
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:27,964
Not if there's money to be made.

317
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,104
It's a delegation from Helena.

318
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,505
It's been a while since you seen anyone

319
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,007
from Helena around in these walls.

320
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,075
Have you ever seen one
of their kids before?

321
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,778
They keep 'em hidden. It's their law.

322
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:47,450
You think that kid's the one?

323
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:48,952
The chosen one's a myth.

324
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,420
That's something they tell children

325
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:53,256
to give them hope.

326
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,225
I don't understand why you'd have me travel

327
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,395
all this way to see
another of your factories.

328
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,464
Well, this isn't one of our factories.

329
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,201
Has Evelyn considered my proposal?

330
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,536
She's not ready to join
in a treaty with you

331
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:09,039
which may pit us against New Delphi.

332
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:10,874
Trading, yes.

333
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:13,877
Armaments, a mutual defense pact,

334
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:17,948
not now.

335
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:22,052
Evelyn wished to give you this.

336
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:23,720
A derringer.

337
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:26,389
One of these killed Abraham Lincoln.

338
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:28,391
[Gasps]

339
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,628
[Chuckles]

340
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,265
A thoughtful gift.

341
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,969
You obviously learned a lot
about me on your last visit.

342
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:41,471
A passion for weapons is hard to forget.

343
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:42,939
I would prefer you remember me

344
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:46,142
for something more inspiring.

345
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:50,113
- And what would that be?
- Hope.

346
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:03,693
Gone are the days when
darkness is something to fear.

347
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,531
With this technology,

348
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,034
the lights of Vega will
shine as a beacon of hope

349
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:15,205
for 1,000 years.

350
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:19,476
Along with food and our medicines,

351
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,478
I can offer 500 brides,

352
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:24,547
all of childbearing age,

353
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,116
in exchange for the technology

354
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,518
to build our own reactor.

355
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:31,021
There'll be time to negotiate later.

356
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:33,323
My men will show you the bungalows

357
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:34,891
where you can rest and freshen up

358
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:38,828
after your flight.

359
00:22:38,863 --> 00:22:40,163
Thank you, David.

360
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:41,698
And tomorrow night,

361
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,333
you'll be my guests at the yearly Jubilee

362
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,168
in the Grand Arena.

363
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,870
It's a small gesture
the house of Whele makes

364
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,639
to inspire and entertain the city.

365
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,776
- Good night, Arika.
- Good night.

366
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:59,749
I wonder if the brides she
was offering would be spies.

367
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:04,387
Possible. We have so much that they don't.

368
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:06,756
Helena has the only
air force in the cradle,

369
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,191
a fleet of aircraft

370
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:12,162
they inherited from hill air force base.

371
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:14,898
The cripple Riesen won't
be an obstacle much longer.

372
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,100
Once we have consolidated our position

373
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,736
and you've been made lord of the city,

374
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,239
we'll want her as an ally.

375
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,782
[Dogs howling and barking]

376
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:01,478
Jeep.

377
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:10,120
I see you still like the highest perch.

378
00:24:10,154 --> 00:24:12,389
It's been 15 years.

379
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:15,792
- I thought you were dead.
- Hmm.

380
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:18,628
14 1/2, but who's counting?

381
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:22,298
- What does everyone else think?
- The same.

382
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,601
David Whele built you a statue in memoriam.

383
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:28,071
That's creepy.

384
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:30,273
It's not a good likeness.

385
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:31,641
It looks more like Whele than you.

386
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:36,112
[Chuckling] He hasn't changed.

387
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,948
We all assumed the tattoos were lost to us.

388
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:41,751
No.

389
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:45,321
Have you deciphered any of them?

390
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:47,123
It isn't just a language to decipher.

391
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:49,492
It's something else.

392
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:50,860
And from what I could find,

393
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,296
there's no historical equivalent.

394
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,132
Much of the last 14 years was
spent on wild goose chases,

395
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,168
looking for the names of
prophets I'd misspelled

396
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:03,339
or tasks I thought I was
commanded to carry out.

397
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:06,743
Unfortunately, the
tattoos are indecipherable.

398
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:16,820
How is he?

399
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:20,156
What's he like?

400
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:24,394
Undisciplined, strong-willed,

401
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:29,632
passionate, mercurial.

402
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,868
Good.

403
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:34,871
- Can you bring him to me?
- Yes.

404
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:43,313
Everything's about to change.

405
00:25:43,347 --> 00:25:45,615
War's coming.

406
00:25:57,795 --> 00:25:59,562
People have lived inside these walls

407
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:02,232
so long they've forgotten
they're not prisoners.

408
00:26:05,703 --> 00:26:07,770
Father, there's something
that I need to tell...

409
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:11,608
I'm stepping down from ruling Vega.

410
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,909
The city's strong enough

411
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:14,410
to give power back to the people.

412
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:16,746
Let them make their own way going forward.

413
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,083
The people are not ready.

414
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:22,285
Vega is not ready.

415
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,054
And Senator Whele will never
give up power that easily.

416
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,524
He won't allow the people
to govern themselves.

417
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,226
Father, if you step down
in the name of democracy,

418
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:33,263
he will turn this city into a dictatorship.

419
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:42,772
And what do you think it is now?

420
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:46,242
You're a good man.

421
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:49,045
Am I?

422
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,981
Why now?

423
00:26:52,016 --> 00:26:54,784
We have worked so hard to build this city

424
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:57,587
into what it is.

425
00:26:57,621 --> 00:26:59,822
You can't just give up.

426
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:03,393
I'm not giving up. I'm moving forward.

427
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:05,261
So should you.

428
00:27:05,296 --> 00:27:07,463
You have the strength of character

429
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:10,934
that Vega desperately needs, Claire.

430
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,569
You'll be important to its survival,

431
00:27:12,603 --> 00:27:16,839
and soon, you'll be
called on to protect it.

432
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:23,213
So what was it you wished to tell me?

433
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:28,651
Nothing. It was nothing.

434
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,651
You're as paranoid as ever.

435
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:04,721
If that were true, you'd be dead.

436
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:09,359
Tell me about the boy.

437
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:12,362
I've never seen any of
your children before.

438
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:16,132
Why bring him here?

439
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:19,302
Roan isn't one of our children.

440
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:20,970
He's favored by Evelyn.

441
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:24,073
She dotes on him like an adopted son.

442
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,676
Oh.

443
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,646
Why?

444
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,914
He's a savant.

445
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:36,152
Knows 20 languages, can
play a Bach piano concerto,

446
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:38,087
recites Shakespeare.

447
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:41,858
His knowledge of history is astonishing.

448
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:45,495
He's amazing, teaching us many things,

449
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:47,764
but he's painfully shy

450
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:53,336
and needs to be treated gently.

451
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,571
Roan wanted to see the great city of Vega,

452
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:58,207
and Evelyn denies him nothing.

453
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:02,011
She believes he's special,

454
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:04,347
very special.

455
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:06,215
And you?

456
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:12,588
I've never seen a child quite like him.

457
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,862
A boy with those gifts
could be useful to Vega.

458
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,597
[Chuckles]

459
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:23,800
He's not for sale.

460
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:27,136
Everything has a price.

461
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:32,842
[Gasps]

462
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:11,647
She wants to see you upstairs.

463
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,249
Needs some stuff from the supply center

464
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:16,185
for tonight.

465
00:30:18,822 --> 00:30:20,256
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,858
I need these filled by early afternoon.

467
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:23,192
- Yes, ma'am.
- Listen.

468
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:24,827
Something is happening with my father

469
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,496
that could change everything.

470
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,831
I couldn't bring it up to him.

471
00:30:28,866 --> 00:30:32,001
So tonight after the Jubilee,

472
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,704
we leave as planned.

473
00:30:34,738 --> 00:30:36,906
That'll be all. Thank you.

474
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:45,748
Come with me.

475
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:56,058
[Blade scraping]

476
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:59,095
[Both grunting]

477
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,547
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:19,582
You've trained him well, Michael.

479
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,792
Dad?

480
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:37,233
How did you get here?

481
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:42,071
I came back last night to see you, to talk.

482
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:45,575
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

483
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,844
You gave me up.

484
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,746
A scribbled note left in
the night made that clear.

485
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:54,550
Do you remember what it said? I do.

486
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:55,852
"You'll be an orphan now, Alex."

487
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,620
I didn't think I'd make it back.

488
00:31:57,654 --> 00:32:00,022
I was 11. You left me alone.

489
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:01,257
You had Michael.

490
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,726
[Scoffs]

491
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,828
He isn't even human.

492
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:08,731
Human enough to side
with us against his own.

493
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,967
The only one to fight for us.

494
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:13,069
Without Michael, we would've lost the war.

495
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:16,239
Alex! Nothing's been done
that wasn't necessary.

496
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:20,109
"Necessary"?

497
00:32:20,143 --> 00:32:21,944
Do you realize by making me an orphan,

498
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,947
you put me in the lowest caste?

499
00:32:24,982 --> 00:32:26,249
A 1.

500
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:28,117
If I hadn't become a soldier,

501
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:30,686
I wouldn't have had anywhere
to sleep or anything to eat.

502
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:32,989
You basically left me to die.

503
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:34,857
It isn't the life I
would have chosen for you.

504
00:32:34,892 --> 00:32:38,027
None of it is.

505
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:41,163
You. You knew this all along.

506
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:44,433
Alex.

507
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:48,437
You go back to whatever
hole you crawled out of.

508
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:51,908
You don't have a son.

509
00:32:56,647 --> 00:33:00,216
We need to bring the council together today

510
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,385
before the Jubilee.

511
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:10,593
Did I do the right thing for Alex?

512
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:15,698
That remains to be seen.

513
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:20,436
They found this at the altar.

514
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:25,007
I don't understand.

515
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:28,144
The angels took everything from us,

516
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:31,213
and there are idiots
who still worship them.

517
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:33,883
I know, but the acolytes are still

518
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:35,251
a small and secretive group.

519
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:37,720
- They can't hide forever.
- Good.

520
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:40,256
My followers will find them.

521
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,692
Keep them searching.

522
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:47,730
Come on inside.

523
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:58,107
[Raspy breathing]

524
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,886
[Snarling]

525
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:14,123
[Gasps]

526
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:16,692
He was caught outside the
city walls this morning,

527
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:19,562
trying to find a way inside.

528
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,931
You... you brought one into the city?

529
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:26,535
People need to be reminded
of what we're up against

530
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,672
and who's protected them all this time.

531
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:42,494
You're sharpening that like
you're gonna kill somebody.

532
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,563
Yeah, you. You're late.

533
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:45,831
I was working in the laundry,

534
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:48,734
and they wouldn't let me go.

535
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:51,070
I'm sorry. I had a bad day.

536
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:52,872
You want to talk about it?

537
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:55,174
It's in the past.

538
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,810
Bixby, gonna meet me at
south entrance of the arena.

539
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:01,247
Access is restricted to V-2 and above.

540
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:03,349
- Can you get in?
- Yeah.

541
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:05,351
10:00 P.M. tonight.

542
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,486
Do you understand? You can't be late.

543
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,488
- What's going on?
- You'll see.

544
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:11,257

01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:45,433
As your father, Jeep held
the tattoos on his body

913
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,301
for when you were ready.

914
01:02:47,336 --> 01:02:49,570
He knew it might mean his death.

915
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:52,239
I'm not ready.

916
01:02:52,274 --> 01:02:55,209
- I'm no savior.
- You are.

917
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:58,079
It's up to you to decipher the tattoos.

918
01:02:58,113 --> 01:03:00,147
I bore them on my body
before they were transferred

919
01:03:00,182 --> 01:03:02,416
onto Jeep's,

920
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:04,885
but they were always
meant for the chosen one.

921
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,955
First the tattoos were on
you. Then they were on Jeep.

922
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:09,590
Then they're on me.

923
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:11,992
How do I know they're not
meant for someone else?

924
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:18,499
What are they?

925
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:21,469
Our fate...

926
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:24,572
Our hope...

927
01:03:24,606 --> 01:03:29,009
written in a language long since forgotten,

928
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,344
one even I don't know.

929
01:03:31,947 --> 01:03:34,515
Can you show them to me?

930
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:41,155
Can you read them?

931
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:46,694
- I can't.
- You must.

932
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:50,498
This is war, and only one side can win.

933
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:52,433
What's in those tattoos will guide you

934
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:54,435
through what's to come.

935
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:55,703
They will lay out the path

936
01:03:55,737 --> 01:03:57,505
through which mankind can be redeemed

937
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:00,107
and Gabriel and his legions pushed back,

938
01:04:00,142 --> 01:04:03,210
but this path will not be easily traversed.

939
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:05,146
At every step,

940
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:10,017
you must choose which course to take.

941
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:14,555
I believe you are the only one

942
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:19,860
that can end this war.

943
01:04:19,895 --> 01:04:23,864
I'm just a man, Michael.

944
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:30,237
How can you be sure?

945
01:04:30,272 --> 01:04:33,874
Nothing is ever certain,

946
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:36,877
but Jeep had hope, Alex.

947
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:40,548
He had faith in you,

948
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:42,416
and so do I.

949
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:46,187
Try.

950
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:49,557
Can you discern anything?

951
01:05:05,106 --> 01:05:08,309
No.

952
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,480
My son,

953
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:48,315
William.

954
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,450
We found him.

955
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:04,800
