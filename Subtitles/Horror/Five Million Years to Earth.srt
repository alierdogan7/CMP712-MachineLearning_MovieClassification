No, not until I've got every scrap of evidence
out of here and made full tests.

00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,849
I never had a career. Only work.

174
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,893
What was yours?

175
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,519
Enemy missiles.

176
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,689
Do you mind stopping off on the way
for a couple of minutes?

177
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,462
Lead on, please.

178
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,266
Captain Potter, sir.

179
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,227
- I hope you didn't mind my...
- Any sign of the mechanism yet?

180
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,853
None, sir. We've found this cavity,

181
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,564
but there's only impacted clay inside.

182
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,400
- Stand down for a moment, Briggs.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,914
Any guesses?

184
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,042
- Possibly a German V weapon.
- Why?

185
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,045
A flying bomb? A V-2 Rocket?

186
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,631
- It's not either of them.
- Obviously.

187
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,259
But they weren't the only surprises
they cooked up in the war.

188
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,094
There were more than anyone knew.

189
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,720
- Sir!
- What is it?

190
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,390
I don't know. It may just be a stone.

191
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,776
CLEGHORN: It's another one of them skulls.

192
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,987
- Corporal.
- CORPORAL: Sir.

193
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,447
- Is Dr Roney still here?
- Yes, sir, I'll fetch him.

194
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,951
- POTTER: It's a skull.
- Let me see.

195
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,289
- Thanks.
- Who is this man?

196
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,957
- Potter, is he attached to you?
- No, sir, that is...

197
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,168
Let me go! Thank you.

198
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,297
Don't you know?
Dr Roney's the man of the moment.

199
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,090
This place is news.

200
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,342
He has no business here now.

201
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,760
Hasn't he?

202
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,763
(RONEY BREATHING HEAVILY)

203
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,693
Thank you. It's absolutely marvellous.

204
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,203
Oh, it's magnificent!

205
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,333
Better than anything we've got so far.
It's almost intact.

206
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,043
- Intact?
- Yes, yes.

207
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,088
This proves everything. It's all I needed.

208
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,924
- No, no, leave it to me.
- You might drop it. It's slippery.

209
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,176
- Drop it? Not on your nelly!
- Here.

210
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,553
How do you think it got inside there?

211
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,847
Oh, it was here in the clay,

212
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,390
when the missile struck,
it got rammed through.

213
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,061
(SCOFFING) Unbroken? A fragile fossil?

214
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,195
Dr Roney, my name's Quatermass.

215
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,613
Are you one of these bomb experts?

216
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,949
- Not exactly.
- Miss Judd here will look after you.

217
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,533
- QUATERMASS: How do you do?
- Hello.

218
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,077
RONEY: I've got to get
this skull under treatment.

219
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,871
That skull seems remarkably well-preserved.

220
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,749
Yes, isn't it? Far better than the first.

221
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,501
What do you think protected it?

222
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,963
Huh? Oh, it was inside the... Inside that...

223
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,299
Good Lord!

224
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,927
I was so concerned just now, I didn't realise.

225
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,305
It was inside. That's no bomb.

226
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,183
Whatever is it?

227
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,186
How old is this fossil skull?

228
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,021
About five million years. It could be more.

229
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,899
Excuse me.

230
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,237
And these are all the Civil Defence records
of the area?

231
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,613
- That's right, sir.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,615
- Breen, I'd like a word with you.
- Just a moment.

233
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Now, you're quite certain?

234
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,661
There were no HE bombs
on the street above here, sir.

235
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,579
Just a few incendiaries,

236
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,082
and they only did damage
because the houses were empty.

237
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,042
Empty?

238
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,461
Evacuated. Thank you, Sergeant.

239
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,423
Come on, Potter.
Let's have another look at this thing.

240
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,764
Excuse me, sir, but that's not quite right.

241
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,016
Oh? Why?

242
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,351
Those houses were all abandoned
years before the war.

243
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,645
- What on earth for?
- Well, people just wouldn't live there.

244
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,063
Some kind of scare.

245
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,149
- Scare?
- Superstition.

246
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,026
A lot of nonsense, I dare say.

247
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,364
There, that's done.
Now, I do think you ought to get a breather.

248
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,658
The air's terrible down here.

249
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,119
All right, but just for a minute.

250
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,424
ELLIS: These are the houses, sir.
Or what's left of them.

251
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,260
- They really are derelict.
- Mmm.

252
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,554
Give me that torch, will you? Thank you.

253
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,100
I must warn you, these buildings aren't safe.

254
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,477
Nevertheless...

255
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,903
I've been reckoning it up.
They must have been empty 40 years now.

256
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,405
- Are you a local man?
- Yes, sir.

257
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,158
- Do you remember what happened?
- Yes, I do.

258
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,035
Oh, it was in all the papers.

259
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,663
Of course, I was only a nipper at the time,

260
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,165
but I knew a kid
that lived in one of these houses.

261
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,170
Things got so bad they had to clear out.

262
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,254
What got bad?

263
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,178
Noises, bumps, and even things being seen.

264
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,639
You mean ghosts?

265
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,768
(STAMMERING) I said it was
a lot of nonsense, sir.

266
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,647
But, you know how these tales run wild
once they get started.

267
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,733
(CREAKING)

268
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,387
Those marks. What could have made them?

269
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,889
(PANTING NERVOUSLY)

270
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,599
Kids, sir.

271
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,687
Kids playing around made 'em.

272
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:24,162
Sorry about that, sir.
Must've been a bit warm inside there.

273
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,080
Yes. Thank you.

274
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,215
BREEN: Everything in order?
POTTER: Yes, sir.

275
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,594
Ah, Quatermass, I've decided
to stay on this case for a day or so,

276
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,554
- if you're agreeable.
- Of course.

277
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,930
You go back to the Rocket Group.

278
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,016
I'll join you there later.

279
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,810
As a matter of a fact, I'd like to hang on, too.

280
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,563
- If you're agreeable.
- As you wish.

281
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,565
I've arranged for an extra squad
to work all night.

282
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,775
The entire missile
should be exposed by the morning.

283
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,862
- Can I?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'll find my own way.

284
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,449
Sorry about the dinner. Some other time.

285
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,872
(ENGINE STARTING)

286
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,374
Miss Judd!

287
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,793
We'd better get down
and give your boss a hand.

288
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,129
He'll be expected to get his gear away.

289
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,798
BARBARA: Hob's Lane.

290
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,636
QUATERMASS: They've changed the spelling.

291
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,597
New one's like Hobbs the cricketer.

292
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,140
But the old one...

293
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,936
Hob was once a sort of nickname
for the Devil.

294
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,956
Oh, Quatermass, come in. Come in.

295
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,875
- Well...
- QUATERMASS: Hmm.

296
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,001
(ELECTRONIC PULSING)

297
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,754
Our daily work. Business as usual,

298
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,006
no matter what happens at Hobbs End.

- Electronics?
- We don't just dig with trowels, you know.

300
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,803
Not all the time. Would you like some coffee?

301
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,181
- Thanks.
- Have you had a cup, Mr Johnson?

302
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,684
- Yes, I have, thanks.
- Don't nod.

303
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,896
Mr Johnson's kindly obliging us
for some tests.

304
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,565
You see, some of his skull dimensions
happen to match

305
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,527
those of our friend here
who died in the second ice age.

306
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:23,155
- I'm real primitive.
- (LAUGHING) We all are, Mr Johnson.

307
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,449
- Now, are you ready for another run?
- Yes, sir.

308
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,828
Right. Recorder on.

309
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,872
(MACHINE CONTINUES PULSING)

310
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,210
Oh, Mr Johnson,
proceed with this puzzle, will you?

311
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,920
That hook up, something special?

312
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,548
RONEY: It can locate
the minutest areas of the brain.

313
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,051
We take readings and analyse them
in the computer here.

314
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,387
We're gradually building up a picture

315
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,265
of what that ice age man
might have been able to think and do.

316
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,225
The Roney Analysis. I like it.

317
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,730
I'm hoping to apply it next
to the Hobbs End skulls.

318
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,815
Of course, they're so much older.

319
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,609
They'll have even fewer points
of resemblance to...

320
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,612
Well, to Mr Johnson, but we hope enough to...

321
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,365
Roney, were they of this Earth?

322
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,368
Ah, I see. That's what brought you here.

323
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,412
Were they?

324
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,208
I'm sorry to disappoint
but the answer's only, "Yes, they were".

325
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,587
They were earthly creatures
as much as you or I.

326
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,172
They were our remote ancestors

327
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,884
but they themselves had ancestors
going back as far as 30 million years.

328
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,052
Well, how can you be sure?

329
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,347
They fit into the known pattern of evolution.

330
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,433
The only odd thing about them
is the great size of the skull.

331
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:37,146
I've got it all charted somewhere.
Where the devil does she keep everything?

332
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,272
QUATERMASS: Your Miss Judd?

333
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,108
Yes. I told her to take the day off
and get some rest.

334
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,693
Well, I must be getting along.

335
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,487
- To Hobbs End?
- Yes.

336
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,324
Look, I can't seem to lay my hands on it
at the moment.

337
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,284
I'll show you next time, for what it's worth.

338
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,119
Next time, I'll have a lot more questions.

339
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,038
Yes. They're piling up, aren't they?

340
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,875
- Are you coming?
- RONEY: I've been told to keep out of it.

341
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,710
Your colleague doesn't like my face.

342
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,463
- Colleague?
- Your Colonel Breen.

343
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,465
- Oh.
- Anyway, it's mutual.

344
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,010
I'm sorry, Quatermass,
he's a type I loathe on sight.

345
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,138
Full marks, Dr Roney. Well, it's a long story.

346
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,140
I'll tell you sometime.

347
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,979
Ah, Professor Quatermass.
I've something to show you.

348
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,689
I thought you were taking the day off.

349
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,982
No, I was having these made.

350
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,776
I'm sorry, I'm due at the excavation.

351
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,820
Please read these first.

352
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,660
- Photocopies.
- From old newspaper files.

Why did you do this?

356
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,675
Well, you seemed curious, too, last night.

357
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,177
I've slept on it since.

358
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,513
Look, read this one.

“Like a hideous dwarf. "

360
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,866
No, my dear, we're both scientists.
We simply can't pay regard to stuff like this.

- Professor Quatermass!

365
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,550
Station. That's when they built it?

366
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,928
They were digging near the same spot.

- BREEN: Ah, good morning.
- Good morning.

369
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,352
You've been busy.
You've cleaned out the inside.

370
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,853
- Yes.
- Find anything?

371
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,356
- Only impacted clay.
- Nothing else?

372
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,860
No, it's been cleared inch by inch
and finally hosed out with water.

373
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,948
- So far, it seems to be just an empty shell.
- Hmm, let me see.

374
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,534
- Now, just a minute.
- What's going on?

375
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,618
A test.

376
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,499
All right, Potter, that's got to be enough.

377
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,211
- No effect, sir.
- There's got to be.

378
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,009
I don't understand that at all.

379
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,678
The heat's been on that for a full five minutes
and it's not even warm.

380
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,015
POTTER: Do you want to try again, sir?

381
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,351
No. There's no chance of
cutting a hole through that.

382
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,772
We've found what seems
to be a sealed compartment.

383
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,940
What?

384
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,862
You'd better put some gloves on, sir.

385
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,988
Why?

386
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:04,204
The sergeant's got a touch of it, too.
Like frostbite, mild though.

387
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,041
Thank you, Sergeant.

388
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,960
- From touching this?
- I don't see how, sir.

389
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,422
It's not cold, but...

390
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,395
What's this?

391
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,480
Oh, it's only our pump.

392
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,107
We had a bit of a flood
when we washed it down.

393
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,568
Careful! It's like glass in here.

394
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,412
I see. Blocked right across.

395
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,747
Yes, sir.

396
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,416
So, unless it's solid,
there's something on the other side of that.

397
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,045
It could be a warhead.

398
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,672
(SCOFFING) Says Colonel Breen.

399
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,678
- Hello, what made these marks?
- Marks?

400
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,098
Not us. This stuff's harder than diamond.
We've tested.

401
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,100
Well, there seem to be...

402
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,561
Have you got a cloth?
Something to wipe it down with.

403
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,158
- Good grief!
- They form a pattern.

404
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,079
More exactly, they form a pentacle.

405
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,582
One of the cabalistic signs
used in ancient magic.

406
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,088
I suppose I'd better mention this
to the colonel?

407
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,134
No. It wouldn't fit in with warheads.

408
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,395
Sergeant, get this pump
out of the way, will you?

409
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,314
Sir. Right. Two men to shift the pump.

410
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,900
West, inside and clear the hose.

411
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,868
Look sharp, West.

412
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,916
Resistant to heat of 3,000 degrees.
Harder than diamond.

413
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,253
Why, it's the material
every rocket engineer's been looking for.

414
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,337
What are you trying to say?

415
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,798
That the Germans didn't make this
and then lose the secret.

416
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,341
You ask Von Braun.

417
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,177
If I can get through that bulkhead,
I won't need...

418
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,720
Try Borazon.

419
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:28,432
It's a lot harder than diamond.
Can you get hold of a Borazon drill?

420
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,184
It would mean getting hold
of a civilian operator.

(STAMMERING) It was... It was a figure.

424
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,035
It went through.
It went straight through the wall!

00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,293

00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,961

QUATERMASS: He may be.

CLEGHORN: All right, West. Take it easy, lad.

429
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,842
I thought it was the wall shining
and then it came straight at me.

430
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,886
- Horrible!
- Come on.

431
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,099
Westie's got the horrors.

432
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,229
- What did he see, sir?
- Nothing. The confined space affected him.

433
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,064
A man like that
should never have been on this job.

434
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,192
- Now pull yourself together, West.
- Sergeant, that's not the way.

435
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,533
- What did you see?
- I don't know.

436
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,576
You... You said a figure.

437
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,621
Yes, sort of crooked.

438
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,331
It went straight through.

439
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,999
Here.

440
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,548
It was horrible. Horrible!

00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,425
Oh, shut up!

443
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:50,055

I did, honest. It was little.

511
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,020
The one you suggested.

512
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,855
I asked him to wait.

513
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,066
Powered from this, I suppose.

514
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,860
Yes, sir. Better than the public supply,
just in case.

515
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,278
In case it blows up?

516
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,114
That's why he won't let
anyone down there, sir.

517
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,324
Oh, very considerate of him.

518
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,745
Oh, I reckon this little beauty
would cut through anything.

(REVVING DRILL)

520
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,917
I did steel armour plate with it.
Six inches thick.

521
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,544
(WHISTLING) Just like that.

522
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,963
Oh, it was legal.

(REVVING DRILL)

524
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,634
But I got him out.

525
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,220
It was a secret job, like this one.

526
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,223
Then I'm glad you don't talk about it.

527
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,562
Ah, Quatermass.

528
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,772
Breen, I think we should hold everything
for a time at least.

529
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,274
I can explain.

530
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,984
We're going ahead now.

All clear!
-Right.

535
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:15,088
You can get clear if you want to.
There's still time.

That's it.

Do you know what's inside there?

540

Are you insured? I'm insured.

541
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,614
It's a good thing to be insured.

542
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,741
At least, it cheers you up.

543
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,327
Okay, sir?

544
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,122
Right, here we go.

You're shaken up. We all are.

554
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,775
It was the vibration in there.

555
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,909
Some sort of freak vibration. Must have been.

556
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,537
- All right, Sladden?
- Hmm.

557
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,169
The drill, it wouldn't work.

558
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:06,551
Roney, this sound, everything here,
just like the old accounts.

559
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,886
- Did she tell you?
- Yes.

00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,013
- And there's a pentacle drawn inside there.
- What?

See for yourself.

563
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,145
Thank you, Sergeant.

- Good man.
- Breen, wait.

566
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,694
We ought to have time to consider this.

567
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,866
I have.
We'll blanket down the sound with sandbags.

568
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,162
I've ordered them down.
I will cover up the polished surface.

569
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,830
But it isn't as simple as that.

571
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,590
I thought you said the drill had no effect?

572
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,222
Well, I never made that.

That's much bigger than my drill bit.

It doesn't look as if it was drilled at all.

for the biggest job they've ever had.

597
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,150

- Explanations later, Sergeant.

602
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,201
They want planks and empty sandbags.

603
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,660
- As many as you can find.
- Right, sir.

605
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,875
Give me a hand.

- I can't guarantee my stomach.
- Steady.

607
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,804
Easy now. Got him.

Oh, my God.

609
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,758
Throw down something to put this on.

610
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,556
And a sandbag.

611
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,656
Easy.

612
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,833
Take it up to the platform, will you?
I'll fix it there.

613
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,296
Don't just stand there. Give a hand!

614
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,342
Hold it level. It's leaking.

616
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,656
- What is it?
- They don't know.

617
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,700
Where can it go?

618
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,744
Oh, there.

619
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,708
I'd better take a photograph of it.

620
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,983
- What are you using?
- Number Four sealer.

621
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,569
- Is it safe?
- I'll have to risk that.

622
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:21,115
If I can just save the shells
and some body fluids for analysis.

623
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,452
These shapes suggest some kind of

624
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,372
apparatus, instruments.

- Isn't yours?

If there were once any
external propulsion units,

629
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,429
I don't see how they were controlled.

630
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,264
Unless...

631
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,268
Unless the missile itself
did some of the thinking.

632
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,312
You're mad!

633
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,357
This substance isn't inert. Far from it.
We know that.

634
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,734
Don't tell me what I know!

635

There's been enough nonsense talked
about this... this thing.

Dead for millions of years!

637
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,659
I know the smell of death, believe me,
and how short a time it lasts.

638
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,203
- Have you got an explanation for all this?
- Yes, I have.

639
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,205
Then why not share it?

640
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,790
When I choose.

641

Gauze, quick!

642
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,596
I want you to get some photographs
of the compartment they were in.

- Of course.
- It's all dropping to powder.

00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,396
Arthropods.

ever had that tripod leg arrangement.

- Roney, this image...
- Rather pretty.

651
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,164
It's like a gargoyle. I mean, in fact.

652
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,793
Haven't you seen it carved in walls
in a dozen countries?

653
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,711
Hidden in the depths of all our minds,

654
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,964
a race memory.

656
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,843
Look at this.

657
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:31,180
A cave painting of 30,000 years ago.
A man in a ritual mask.

658
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,767
I wonder where he dreamed up
the idea of that.

659
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,937
Thanks.

660
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,899
Hmm.

00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,988
You know, I think these are old friends
we haven't seen for a time.

to low gravity environment.

00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,788
Perhaps a world that's dead now,

665
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,709
but a few million years ago
could have been teeming with life.

666
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,669
I wonder.

before anything turned up to claim it.

Miss Judd, can you do something about this?

674
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,452
Get Dr Roney to call 'em off,
or we'll be needing the police.

675
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,661
I'll see what I can do.

676
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,872
And there were how many
of these ape creatures?

677
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,958
Seven. Well, six at least we found.

678

Apes with oversized craniums.

679
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,631
Some faculties had developed in them,

680
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,174
or had been developed.

681
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,342
What?

The will to survive. It's an odd phenomenon.

that our Earth was doomed,

say by climatic changes,
what would we do about it?

How much do you know?

716
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,412
Something from Colonel Breen and

717
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,539

718
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,793
- Why did you do it?
- People wanted to know.

719
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,796
So you talked.
Without authority or consultation.

720
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,131
Whose authority?

721
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,300
This department's.

722
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,844

729
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,820
Dr Roney and I are satisfied that
these arthropods are not of this Earth.

730
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,574
So I gathered.

731
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,746
You've been busy hinting at Mars.

732
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,417
Mars is dead.

733
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,213
Nothing there but a few scraps of lichen.

734
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,673
Five million years ago
it may have been very different.

735
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,344
Suppose, at that time,
there were living beings on it

736
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,679
with techniques that enabled them
to visit the Earth.

737
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,225
At a time when the most
highly-evolved creatures here,

738
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,851
our own ancestors,

739
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,978
were only a type of Pliocene ape.

740
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,773
Go on.

741
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,817
They may have wanted
to found another colony

742
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,027
when their own world was doomed,

743
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,695
but couldn't endure our atmosphere.

744
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,365
- So they experimented.
- Experimented?

745
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:03,244
The man apes found beside the missile
were abnormal.

746
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,207
Oh, and the insects were responsible.

747
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,126
QUATERMASS:
There's clearly some connection.

748
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:15,548
My guess is that those were ape mutations
being brought back for release on Earth.

749
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,217
BREEN: And you really believe
that this was possible?

750
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,681
That apes were systematically taken
from this planet to another and...

751
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,934
Altered by selective breeding,

752
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,187
atomic surgery, methods we can't guess.

753
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:34,441
And returned with new faculties
instilled in them.

754
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,735
High intelligence.

755
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,238
Perhaps something else.

756
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,242
In effect, a colonisation.

757
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,912
It'd be a way of possessing the Earth.

758
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,082
Only a colony by proxy,
but better than leaving nothing at all behind.

759
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:55,045
Surely, it would have had to be carried out
on a huge scale?

760
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,797
Yes, if I'm right...

761
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,926
If I'm right,
we've just come on a single instance.

762
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,597
Probably an accident,
a landing that went wrong and they all died.

00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,766

765
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:16,358
That we owe our human condition here
to the intervention of insects!

766
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,779
I suppose I am.

767
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,615

783

I think that when the Germans
were losing the war,

784
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,371
they tried a propaganda scare.

785
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,165
They sent over an experimental V weapon

786
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,544

exactly the effect it has produced,

Them. Them!

01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,687
No more, please!

862
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:18,066
I remember
it started and then I could only see them

863
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:22,446
like you found down there.
With the eyes and horns and...

864
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,782

01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,453
Alive?

867
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,873
Hopping, like very fast,

868
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:35,000
and hundreds and hundreds!

869
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,878
And I knew I was one.

870
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,504
How did they move?

871
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,507
Jumping, leaping.

872
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,176
- Let him alone!
- Where?

873
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:48,764
In and out. Them big places.
In and out of them.

01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,524
No.

He isn't free of it yet.

- What do you mean?

01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,919
On the contrary, I agree with you.
What's been uncovered is evil.

887
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,256
As anciently diabolic as anything on record.

888
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,967
I think what he gave us just now

889
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,388
was a vision of life on Mars
five million years ago.

890
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:16,434
That and the unconscious ability
to cause movement.

891
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:21,273
They're old powers that can be awakened
somehow by the thing in the pit.

892
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,443
Shouldn't we tell the Ministry? Warn them?

893
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,281
They wouldn't listen.

- Yes.

over half the roads in the country.

are still coming through here all right.

01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:17,931
Perhaps they all came from there.

01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,725
So as far as anybody is,

935
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,269
we're the Martians now?

that this stored memory of killing

certainly has an imagination
