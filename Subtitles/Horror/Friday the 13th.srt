Any particular reason?

It's just a problem l have.

The one who attacked me.

942
01:31:51,236 --> 01:31:53,830
The one who pulled me
underneath the water.

943
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:59,267
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

944
01:32:01,246 --> 01:32:02,178
But he...

945
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:10,682
Then he's still there.
