00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,645
<i> Welcome</i>
      <i> to Camp Blue Finch,</i>

2
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,814
    <i> where romance in the sun</i>
    <i> can turn deadly!</i>

3
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:55,049
Best summer ever!

4
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:59,619
       This is the summer
       that's going to
       change your life.

5
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:00,686
<i> Where</i>
      <i> the days are warm...</i>

6
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:03,088
 Hey, Nance,
 that guitar is choice.

7
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,256
              Thanks, Blake.
              Bitching hair.

8
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:07,558
    <i> ...the girls are cool...</i>

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,259
     Did I miss
     the <i> Kumbaya</i> circle?

10
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:12,262
 <i> ...the nights are always hot.</i>

11
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:14,230
      <i> And evil lurks</i>
      <i> around every corner.</i>

12
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:17,132
 Gosh, you startled me.

13
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:18,800
         So, I just go down
         that path all the way?

14
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:21,469
 A guy like you can go
 anywhere he wants.

15
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,139
<i>-  And any moment,</i>
<i>-  Billy can strike.</i>

16
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,679
<i> They won't be singing</i> Kumbaya.

17
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,282
<i> They'll be</i>
          <i> screaming Kum Ba No!</i>

18
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:46,251
     <i> Pack your bags</i>
     <i> for Camp Bloodbath...</i>

19
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,519
     You just messed
     with the wrong virgin.

20
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,887
        <i> ...where the</i>
        <i> only marshmallow</i>

21
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,756
        <i> that will roast</i>
        <i> is your sanity.</i>

22
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:43,604
               Well, they'll
               let me know.

23
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:46,273
 You know you're too good
 for this crap, right?

24
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,942
         The casting director
         was all like, "I know
         you from somewhere."

25
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,044
           And I went, "Really?
           Oh, it's probably

26
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,146
           "my arc on <i> CSI</i> as
           a bipolar mistress."

27
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:55,615
              And he's like,
              "No, I got it.
              <i> Camp Bloodbath."</i>

28
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:58,450
          Am I ever going to
          live that movie down?

29
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:01,252
                 I mean, it was
                 20 years ago.

30
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:02,353
          Honestly, if you
          ever become an actor,

31
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:04,254
              don't ever do
              a slasher flick.

32
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,856
 You wouldn't catch
 me dead in a movie.
 You're the actress here.

33
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,290
                 Damn straight.

34
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:11,626
            And I'm no actress.
            I'm a movie star.

35
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,663
                    Mel's?

36
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,599
      Mel's.

37
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,367
Let's rock and roll.

38
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:29,905
So, we owe
           the electric company

39
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:31,973
 $174.88 by next Monday...

40
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:34,976
            You remember Frank?

41
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,077
              He told me he was
              going to take me

42
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,778
                to Palm Springs
                this weekend.

43
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,945
                    No message.
                    No text.

44
00:03:38,947 --> 00:03:40,446
 No surprise.

45
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,781
     You know, it's just
     he said we were exclusive.

46
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,549
    Well, he said it,
    he doesn't act like it.

47
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:47,651
      Whatever.
      What do I know?

48
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,121
              You must think
              I'm a total zero.

49
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:53,489
 Screw him, Mom.

50
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,624
    And screw his shady
    hotel in Palm Springs.

51
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,258
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:58,426 --> 00:03:59,793
             Look at you
             taking care of me.

53
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,862
               What happened to
               that little girl

54
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:04,096
           I used to dance with
           in the backyard?

55
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:05,864
    She grew up and is
    trying to figure out

56
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,932
 where this $174
 is gonna come from.

57
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,938
   What are you doing?
   Are you crazy?

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,139
Our song!

59
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,475
       Mom. We need to
       figure this out.

60
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,482
      You're such a dork.

61
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:36,852
             Everything in my
             life, I got wrong.

62
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:40,555
               But you,
               I got you right.

63
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,624
          I love you.
          You know that, right?

64
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,428
             What?

65
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,829
               Nothing.

66
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:55,031
                    Nothing.

67
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,985
Max, those are
            really expensive...

68
00:06:32,587 --> 00:06:34,320
Gertie's here.

69
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,656
 Coming, Aunt Pearl.

70
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:48,530
            So, when Chris
            asked you to study,
            was he like,

71
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,265
                "I want you
                to come study"?

72
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:53,634
           Or was he like,
           "I want you to come.

73
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:56,902
                       "Study."

74
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:59,337
 Please. I'm only going,
 so I don't flunk Classics.

75
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,172
        Come on, you know
        that he broke up with
        Vicki last week, right?

76
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:03,274
             And she is a mess.

77
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,476
       Have you seen the veiled
       suicide note/poem

78
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,578
             she posted on
             her Facebook page?

79
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,180
It's so hilarious.

80
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:11,915
             I read it out
             loud to myself.

81
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:12,748
                   A lot.

82
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:16,351
    Hmm.

83
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,389
              Hey, just keep on
              keeping on.

84
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:22,957
 What does that even mean?

85
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,359
         Something my therapist
         tells me all the time.

86
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,427
   You have a therapist?
                     Mmm-hmm.

87
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,262
 Does that
 help you deal?

88
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,530
           Mmm. No, not really.

89
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:34,165
               She's a physical
               therapist, so...

90
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:36,966
Okay. So, the
           myth of Persephone.

91
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:37,933
              Max, you want
              to take this one?

92
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:39,935
                      Sure.

93
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,202
               She's the
               daughter of Zeus

94
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:43,971
             and she eats
             pomegranate seeds,

95
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,940
             and then
             Hades kidnaps her
             to the underworld.

96
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,274
 Yeah. Okay, good.

97
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:49,441
 So, they go back
 to the underworld

98
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,842
    and Persephone
    is freaking out,

99
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:52,176
 and Hermes is like,
 "It's okay, it's okay.

100
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:53,377
 "Just keep looking forward,

101
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,011
 "or we'll be
 stuck here forever."

102
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:58,114
        Max, do you want to jot
        any of this down or...

103
00:07:58,116 --> 00:07:59,648
 Oh, no, it's okay, Max.
 I've already got a copy.

104
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,949
 You can copy from me later

105
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,751
 or I can give it to you
 if you... If you want.

106
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:06,653
 I'm gonna stop talking.

107
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,956
                  Oh, shit.
 Max, hey, wait.

108
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,125
 Did you not get
 my messages?
                    Duncan. No.

109
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,694
 Please, come on. Please.

110
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,929
                 Seriously, no.

111
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,197
 The Bath-maticians
 were so excited
 when I told them

112
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,265
 that Amanda Cartwright's
 daughter was my sister's
 best friend.

113
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,833
                Step-sister.

114
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:27,068
 Why would you say that?
 That's so hurtful.

115
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,670
 Please, Max,
 I promised that
 you'd be there.

116
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:31,571
 I am the assistant
 general manager

117
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:33,539
 of the varsity.
 Think of my reputation.

118
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,907
              Wait. What are
              "Bath-maticians"?

119
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,775
 Uh, <i> Camp Bloodbath</i> fans.

120
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,443
 It's kind of our
 awesome nickname.

121
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,845
 Did you know that a nickname
 immediately becomes uncool

122
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:41,745
     when you give it
     to yourself?

123
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,480
 You know what, Gertie?

124
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,850
 When my dad told me that I was
 going to get a sister, I cried

125
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,084
 because that's all
 I'd ever wanted.

126
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:52,721
 But not like this.
 Not like this.

127
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:54,856
    Don't.

128
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,760
 Look, <i> Camp Bloodbath</i>
 is like the granddaddy

129
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,461
 of all campsite
 slasher films, okay.

130
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:02,929
 Amazing production design,

131
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:05,231
 insane music,
 over-the-top acting.

132
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,599
 It's a cult classic.

133
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:08,133
 Max's mom plays Nancy,

134
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,268
 this sort of
 shy girl-next-door

135
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,103
 who gives up her butterfly
 to some dumb jock,

136
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,038
 and Billy Murphy
 comes along

137
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,206
and chops her ass up
 on a waterbed.

138
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,341
Sorry, Duncan.

139
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,642
       Tell your cult, maybe
       I'll see them next year.

140
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:22,845
           I'll do all your
           Classics assignments

141
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:24,146
      for the rest of the year.

142
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,548
         Papers, your homework,
         all of it.

143
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,484
            Gertie told me that
            you were failing.

144
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,953
  Please, Max, what do you say?
  You wanna graduate, or not?

145
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,131
Max!

146
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,300
                   Gertie!
 Oh, you scared me.

147
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,537
   Well, this will
   be fun, huh?

148
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,339
 Being trapped in
 a movie theater
 with a bunch of nerds.

149
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,340
                  Yeah, sure.

150
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:59,542
 You know what
 was fun, though?

151
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:02,411
 Watching Chris today,
 ogle over you.

152
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,845
            Shut up.

153
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,146
 What? That's a word,
 right? Ogle?

154
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,448
 He likes you so much,
 it's so cute.

155
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,749
           Gertie. Get real.

156
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,951
       He's like a giant, okay?
       So, imagine us together.

157
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,017
               I'd need stilts
               to kiss him.
      Hey!

158
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:15,186
            Hey!
                     Hi.

159
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,388
                   What are you
                   doing here?

160
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,956
 I figured you needed
 some, uh, moral support.

161
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:23,792
 Why, should I go?
 Because I can if
 this is weird...

162
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:25,760
   No, don't be
   crazy, Christopher.

163
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,695
     We're so happy
     you're here.

164
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,329
       I'm going to
       go popcorn up,
       see you inside.

165
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,271
 Wow. Your mom
 was gorgeous.

166
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,942
 I'm sorry. That's a weird
 thing to say, isn't it?

167
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,744
Kind of.

168
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,278
 It's kind of cool
 we get to honor her
 memory this way, right?

169
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:51,979
                    Um...

170
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,348
        Today's the anniversary
        of her death.

171
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:57,783
       I, uh...

172
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:00,651
 I don't know what to say.

173
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,852
                 Me neither.

174
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,121
              At least,
              I get to see her,

175
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,457
    even if she is being chased
    by a psycho with a machete.

176
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,793
Stop, stop, stop.

177
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,027
   Oh, great.

178
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,863
 Hey! What a coincidence!

179
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:20,764
 This is Tyson.
 We've been hanging out

180
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,465
and he's so funny.

181
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:26,268
 My abs are like shredded
 from laughing so hard.

182
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,936
 Anyway, Tyson wanted
 to come here tonight

183
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:31,205
 and I was like,
 "Oh, my God, no."
 But here we are.

184
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,507
 So, you win, Tyson.

185
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,976
 So, you didn't see
 my post about it,
 or anything?

186
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,011
 No, I don't go on
 your stupid Twitter,

187
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,246
 which, by the way, has lost
 three more followers today.

188
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,147
 Anyway, see you
 guys inside, okay?

189
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:43,114
Go.

190
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,652
        I'm so wiped from
        all these applications.

191
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:50,754
        Even my safety schools,
        Stanford and Cornell,

192
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:52,388
 I'm not gonna just
 half-ass them, you know.

193
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,856
 It's just not my style.

194
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:56,358
           I am lucky that
           I even made it out
           tonight at all.

195
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,759
 Thank you, Adderall.

196
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,128
 Where'd Terry go?

197
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,196
             Terry? Tyson?
       Tyson.

198
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:06,332
            Oh, yeah, he just
            got like super-sick
            super-fast.

199
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,766
        Mmm.

200
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,401
 Oh, no, not the
 super-sick super-fast.

201
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:15,772
 Max, are they doing this
 because it's, you know,
 the anniversary?

202
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,841
             Yeah, I'm here
             for an appearance.

203
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,275
        I didn't think you'd...

204
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:22,577
 Come on, Max.
 Of course, I would remember.

205
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:25,279
 I have really good memory.
 It's not just the Adderall.

206
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,514
 Hey, do you want anything?

207
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:29,015
 I'm gonna go get
 a popcorn

208
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,317
 and then we can
 dump M&M'S into it.

209
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,818
 That way, every handful is,
 like, kind of suspenseful?

210
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:36,086
                          Sure.

211
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,487
         Hey, Chris, I'm just
         gonna have a Diet Coke

212
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,255
 and a child-size
 popcorn,

213
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:40,256
              but make sure to
              dump half of it
              into the garbage.

214
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:41,523
 You remember, right?

215
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,625
         You know what,
         I'm just going
         to come with you.

216
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:46,461
 She is the worst.

217
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,228
She's like a
 living nightmare.

218
00:12:48,563 --> 00:12:50,263
 I can't believe
 you used to be
 friends with her.

219
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,631
 Look, she's probably
 gonna pee on him

220
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:52,632
 just to mark
 her territory.
               Gertie!

221
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:53,966
                 Max!

222
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:56,568
            Hey, hey, you came.
     Oh, God.

223
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,835
All hail, Max!

224
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,204
        Sorry, I don't know why
        I worshipped you then,

225
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,471
               I'm just excited
               to see you.

226
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:05,974
 You're also really weird.
 You're very strange and weird.

227
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,509
            I can put you down
            for the Q&A, right?

228
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,110
                After the show,
                do a little Q.

229
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:11,377
                No.

230
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,445
                And a little A

231
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,180
  I'll put you down as a maybe.
  Okay, glad you're here.

232
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,247
                            Oh!

233
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,817
All right.

234
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:51,043
        <i> Hey, guys, we're here!</i>

235
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:53,145
<i> Whoo!</i>

236
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,880
<i> Someone wake up</i>
 <i> Sleeping Beauty back there.</i>

237
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,218
       <i> Are we there yet?</i>

238
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:11,157
         You okay?

239
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:14,526
                     Yeah.

240
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,629
<i> It all</i>
 <i> happened so long ago.</i>

241
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:21,665
<i> Little Billy Murphy</i>
<i> went to camp here decades ago.</i>

242
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:26,268
   <i> And he was always picked on</i>
   <i> for being different, ugly.</i>

243
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,904
    <i> And then one summer,</i>
    <i> the hottest one on record,</i>

244
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:32,072
<i> the counselors decided</i>
<i> to play a little prank on him.</i>

245
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,175
      <i> No one really knows</i>
      <i> how Billy was</i>

246
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,977
      <i> before it happened.</i>

247
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,946
   <i> The counselors hated him,</i>

248
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,281
    <i> and the other kids</i>
    <i> bullied him mercilessly.</i>

249
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,216
                Stop! Go away!

250
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,388
<i> Billy, open up.</i>

251
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,389
<i> I know</i>
 <i> how to get him out.</i>

252
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,245
    <i> Soak this moment in, babe,</i>

253
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:23,647
      <i> because you're always</i>
      <i> gonna remember me.</i>

254
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:25,215
 <i> What does that tattoo mean?</i>

255
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,717
  <i> It was given to me in juvie.</i>

256
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,652
  <i> I was caught</i>
  <i> stealing cherries.</i>
  <i> I'm a... I'm a cherry thief.</i>

257
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:36,355
<i> Neat.</i>

258
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,002
              Oh.

259
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,537
 <i> Nice legs.</i>

260
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:56,671
 <i> What time they open?</i>

261
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,013
         <i> Kurt?</i>

262
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,254
<i> Kurt?</i>

263
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:20,155
                I'm going to
                get some air.

264
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:49,376
 The exits
 are blocked!

265
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:51,844
       Duncan, is there an exit
       behind the screen?

266
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:52,711
                      Yes. Yes.

267
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,580
Come on!
           Go, go, go.

268
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:08,989
Go, go, go.

269
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:48,222
       Max!
              Oh, God!
              What happened?

270
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:50,190
                 Where the hell
                 are we?
           I don't know.

271
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:51,191
   Did the theater burn down?

272
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,329
     That was the scariest
     thing I have ever seen.

273
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:58,864
           You're alive!
           Oh, thank God!

274
00:17:58,866 --> 00:17:59,865
    What does
    poison ivy look like?

275
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:00,832
 Because I think I got...

276
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,133
            Help me.

277
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,768
    Guys, somebody's coming.

278
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,049
 Hey, do you guys know
 the way to Camp Blue Finch?

279
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,117
                    Tina!
      Yeah?

280
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:38,762
                  Oh, my God.

281
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,497
           I'm having
           a psychotic episode.

282
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,398
 We all saw
 the same thing, right?

283
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,733
 Maybe it's a dream.
 A collective dream.

284
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:46,868
            If this is a dream,
            then there's a very
            strong chance

285
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,736
         that my dad's going
         to come up to us naked

286
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,371
                and offer us
                some pecan pie.

287
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:54,206
           But don't take any.
           It is not pecan pie.

288
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:55,674
Oh.

289
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:02,247
            Maybe we're dead
            and this is heaven.

290
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,448
                     This can't
                     be heaven.

291
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,882
              Max is here
              and she's Jewish.

292
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:06,350
              Oh, right.

293
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:07,284
       Well, maybe
       it's Jewish heaven.

294
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,153
    Look!

295
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:25,030
 Hey, do you guys know
 the way to Camp Blue Finch?

296
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,498
Uh, yeah.

297
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,400
          Just keep going
          the way you're going.

298
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,635
 Oh, wow, okay.
 Thanks so much.

299
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,773
       We're not dead.
       We're insane!

300
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:40,508
               No, we're not.

301
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,676
       And I don't think we're
       in the Valley anymore.

302
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,413
      Is anybody getting
      any bars?

303
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,047
No.

304
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,815
Eight, seven...

305
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,917
 ...six, five...

306
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,027
 Hey, do you guys know
 the way to Camp Blue Finch?

307
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:09,462
 Yeah, actually
 we're counselors,

308
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:12,031
 and we can show you
 if you'd just give us a ride.

309
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,766
 Oh, rad! Yeah, hop in.

310
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:15,067
     Tubular!

311
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,469
                 Dude, what
                 are you doing?

312
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:20,205
 Do we have a choice?
 We're kind of stuck.

313
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,606
      Let's go.

314
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,540
Max.

315
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:28,743
         Come on, guys.

316
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,481
 You guys coming?

317
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,688
I can't believe
 you guys are counselors, too.

318
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,690
 We've never had
 this many before.

319
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:46,557
          When the kids
          get here next week,

320
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,058
        they're gonna be
        so pumped.

321
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,692
Hey, where are
      you guys' suitcases?

322
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,927
             Because, honestly,
             your clothes,

323
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,295
            they're disgusting.

324
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:54,829
 Says the guy
 in the crop top.

325
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,397
                   What's up?

326
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,799
      Are you guys poor people?
      Are you guys poor?

327
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,635
                  Uh, we packed
                  light. Yeah.
            Mmm-hmm.

328
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,802
                   What did you
                   pack, Tina?

329
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,305
        The basics, bikini,
        mouthwash, diaphragm.

330
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,041
Hell, yeah,
                    you did.

331
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:10,375
            'Cause they're
            gonna get so naked.

332
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,543
         How did you know?

333
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:16,213
                  Spring break,
                  forever.

334
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:20,083
         Hey, guys, we're here!

335
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:22,085
Whoo!

336
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:24,319
Someone wake up
  Sleeping Beauty back there.

337
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,493
       Mmm.

338
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,861
 Are we there yet?

339
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,735
          Oh, hi!

340
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:47,905
   I'm Nancy.
   What's your name?

341
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,109
Max.

342
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,144
               First time
               away from home?

343
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:56,712
                  It's okay.

344
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,613
        It's hard to be away
        from your parents, huh?

345
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:10,690
Best summer ever!

346
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,872
                       Oh! Yes.

347
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:32,807
                  Whew.

348
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:35,675
 Well, kiddo,
 this is the summer

349
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:37,809
    that's going to
    change your life.

350
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:40,477
             No kidding.

351
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:43,613
 Hey, Nance,
 that guitar is choice.

352
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:45,414
            Thanks, Blake.
            Bitching hair.

353
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,182
Ah.

354
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:50,885
         Okay. So, we're
         in the movie.

355
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,987
 Uh-huh. How do we
 get outta here?
    Yeah, I like that question.

356
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:54,154
          That's a really,
          really good question.

357
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,788
         Duncan, can you answer
         that question, please?

358
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,322
  What are you talking about?

359
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:59,023
          It's 1986!

360
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:00,124
               Our homes
               don't exist yet.

361
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:01,725
 They're probably just
 landfills waiting to be

362
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,193
 turned into
 crappy subdivisions.

363
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:04,994
      We don't exist yet.

364
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:06,695
     I know for a fact my
     parents haven't met

365
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,463
      because I was
      an unplanned child.

366
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,032
        Anyone wanna help me
        pick some strawberries?

367
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:15,702
 No, but I'll
 give you a hand
 with those melons.

368
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:18,571
 Talking about her boobs!
 You guys get me, right?

369
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:19,838
Yeah,
              we do, brother.

370
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,575
      Kurt is insatiable.

371
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,810
    Um, okay,
    so Mimi's in the woods,

372
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:29,646
 that means everything
 is right on schedule.

373
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:30,913
 She hooks up
 with that hiker.

374
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:32,648
              But then she gets
              killed, right?

375
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,951
      Yeah, exactly.
      Everyone who has sex
      in this movie dies.

376
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:36,785
         It's awesome.

377
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:39,720
I got into
         bodybuilding big time.

378
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,321
     Yeah. Oh, my God,
     can I touch it?

379
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:42,789
             Yeah, touch it.
          Oh, wow.

380
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,223
              The backside's
              just as hard.

381
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,023
            Touch the backside.

382
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,593
 That's right. Everyone.

383
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,927
              I'm with Gertie
              on this one.

384
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,261
            Let's just take
            their van and bail.

385
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,528
                  What do we
                  have to lose?

386
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,563
          Yeah, did I say that?
          I did? Okay.

387
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:56,865
 We actually probably
 shouldn't talk to them.

388
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:00,568
 Oh! What's up, funbags?

389
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,404
 Funbags. Right.
 Yay, feminism.

390
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:06,006
      Listen, we need
      to borrow your van
      for a little while.

391
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:07,707
 Is that okay? Yeah?

392
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:10,176
I don't know.
 What's in it for me?

393
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,445
 How about my friends
 don't kick your ass?

394
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:21,017
    Oh! This guy's
    your friend?

395
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,518
   Yeah, right.
   You want to go?

396
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,853
               No, no. God, no.
      Bicep, smash.

397
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,921
 And that would kill you.
 That's a karate technique.

398
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,622
         No, I don't.
         I've never actually

399
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:30,156
             fought anyone
             before in my life.

400
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,723
  Yeah, well, I have.
  So many times.

401
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,159
     Seven times.

402
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:39,929
         Hey, this is so weird.
         Do me a favor and just
         zing me. Just get me.

403
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:43,598
      Fine. How about
      you go suck a turd?

404
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:48,068
                    The writing
                    is so bad.

405
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,105
    Okay, tell you what.
    You find the keys
    and the van's yours.

406
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,308
            Oops.

407
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,475
           Really?

408
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,377
         I'm glad
         that you die.

409
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:02,611
- What?
- Nothing!

410
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:06,014
    What she meant to say was,
    that we all die eventually.

411
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:08,649
    Technically, we start dying
    the moment we're born.

412
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:09,650
   Yeah, right.

413
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:14,320
            Yes, but not
            to overwhelm you...
 Okay.

414
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:15,854
 I liked you when you were
 laughing at my jokes.

415
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:17,288
 Now, I just think
 you're weird.

416
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,522
               Okay, let's just
               go get the...

417
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:19,589
                Sorry. Let's go
                get the keys.

418
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,537
 Oh, hey, you wanna
 give me a hand?

419
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,573
                 Sure.

420
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,507
      All right.
      Let's rock and roll.

421
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:44,142
            Oh, my God.
            It really is you.

422
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,978
       What?
                   Nothing.

423
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,812
Whoo!

424
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:51,848
               All right!
               Push-up time!

425
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,248
           So, um...

426
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,885
     Kurt told me he
     wants to do it later.

427
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:00,454
           Wow. Just like that?

428
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:02,189
I know!

429
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,558
     And it's like, I can't
     stay a virgin forever,
     you know?

430
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,692
    And he's been
    with a lot of girls,

431
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:07,460
 so he can
 probably, like,

432
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:09,061
      I don't know,
      help me along.

433
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:11,029
        You shouldn't have sex!

434
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:12,797
          Why?

435
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,832
         Because I heard
         that sex can kill you.

436
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,569
 Max. Sex isn't
 anything to be afraid of.

437
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:19,903
 I mean, Tina's already
 done it twice today,

438
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:21,104
     and look at her,
     she's totally normal.

439
00:26:25,776 --> 00:26:27,143
 Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

440
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:28,611
      She says the best
      feeling in the world

441
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:30,245
   is getting stoned and
   doing it on a waterbed.

442
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,881
        Don't hang around Tina.

443
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,149
 No, but I told myself
 that I was going to

444
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:37,750
   lose my virginity
   this summer.

445
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,351
     Get drunk!
     Not necessarily
     in that order.

446
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:40,785
         Please, just trust me.

447
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:43,053
 You sound like my mom.

448
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:45,722
             Right back at you.

449
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:47,223
       Hello, hi.

450
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:50,025
    Uh, we have to
    go get everyone.
    Let's go.

451
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:51,659
    We will pick this up again.
    Is that understood?

452
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,427
    In the meantime,

453
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:54,828
 just stay away from Kurt
 and keep your shorts on.

454
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:57,763
                 Okay.

455
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:58,764
What
             are you doing?

456
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,301
     Dibs on the one
     that looks like
     Ricky Schroder.

457
00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:07,071
 Their hair's so flat.
 It's making me sad.

458
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:08,939
          That girl
          with the freckles
          is sort of cute.

459
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:09,906
                   You know,
                   none of them

460
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:11,707
            are on the
            counselors' roster.

461
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:16,944
      Where did they come from?

462
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:23,583
 We are never gonna
 find these keys.

463
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,585
        Not with that attitude,
        we're not.

464
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,154
               Though,
               you are correct.

465
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:38,495
      Let's go back. Now.

466
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,897
                Shh.
                It's happening.

467
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:42,598
We have
                 to warn her.
No. No.

468
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,466
             Just think of them
             as animals

469
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:45,867
                on a nature
                preserve, okay?

470
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,969
                Our duty is
                not to disrupt,
                but to observe.

471
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:52,038
Oh!

472
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,374
 Oh, gosh,
 you startled me.

473
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:57,642
Sorry,
          I'm looking for town.

474
00:27:57,644 --> 00:28:00,077
         So, I just go down
         that path all the way?

475
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,146
A guy like you
 can go anywhere he wants.

476
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,314
  I can't believe
  we're just gonna

477
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,282
 casually watch
 someone get murdered.

478
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,283
 What is this, Detroit?

479
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:10,085
Mmm.

480
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:15,088
 What is that noise?
       It's Billy. He's coming.

481
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,424
  Let's get out
  of here then.
            No, no. Stay, stay.

482
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:31,501
 Did you hear something?

483
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,568
                 Baby, I didn't
                 hear a thing.

484
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:41,042
 Give me a second.
 Go over there. Get ready.

485
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,055
 Okay! Where's the beef?

486
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:05,896
 Come on, man!
 I said, where's the...

487
00:29:20,471 --> 00:29:21,571
              Run!

488
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,339
                Go, go, go, go!

489
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:24,540
Guys, guys,
            wait, wait, wait.

490
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,908
               Duncan!

491
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,442
 What are you doing?

492
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:29,177
       Duncan.

493
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:31,979
           It's okay.
           He won't hurt us.

494
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,814
        He would've
        killed me by now, okay?

495
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,817
 I think it's because we're not
 actually part of the movie,

496
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,718
       he doesn't really
       know what to do with us.

497
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,053
 Isn't that right, Billy Boy?

498
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:44,156
               Man, you are
               big and scary.

499
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,924
  I wonder if all this blood
  is just corn syrup, you know?

500
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,225
          Like these characters
          are walking around

501
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,793
      with just corn syrup
      in their veins, you know?

502
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:51,228
 Let's give it a shot here.

503
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:57,265
        Oh, God.
        No, that is, um...
        That is not corn syrup.

504
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:59,300
         That is...
         Oh, God, that's blood.

505
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,103
    All the more reason for us
    to get the hell outta here.

506
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,270
       No, no. Look,
       everything in this world

507
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:05,804
           is running
           exactly on schedule.

508
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:08,273
             Besides, to leave,

509
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,375
       we probably have to wait
       until the movie's over,
       or something.

510
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:12,076
 Well, when is that
 going to happen?

511
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,877
         Okay, look,
         movies like this end

512
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,678
         when the final girl
         kills the main bad guy

513
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,179
        and the credits roll.

514
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,647
       It's actually
       pretty sick in this one.

515
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:21,149
         She kicks up the sword
         and she kills him with
         his own machete

516
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,784
- And Billy's like...
-         It goes        right through his hands.

517
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:25,452
Like...

518
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:30,356
- Head splits open. Pfft!
-   Punches it.

519
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:32,057
             Brain goes out...

520
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:33,825
Duncan!
    Ugh.

521
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:37,161
         Anyway, this smoking
         hot girl called Paula,

522
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:39,830
  she arrives in the next reel,
  she's the final girl.

523
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:44,367
 Oh, yeah, she is the only one
 in this movie who doesn't die.

524
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:46,702
            All we've got to do
            is stick with her

525
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:48,103
   and we're going to have
   the best seats in the house.

526
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:50,839
     Trust me, this last battle
     will blow your minds.

527
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:52,340
- Okay, selfie time.
- Duncan!

528
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,193
                    Oh, my God.
                    Oh, my God.

529
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:33,410
       I think I almost
       just pissed my pants.

530
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:34,644
    You did piss your pants.

531
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:36,012
            What? No, I didn't.

532
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:53,924
Let's get
  out of here!

533
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:58,628
 Wait! Where are you going?

534
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,929
           You're gonna miss
           the slumber party.

535
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,497
         You came back! Yay!

536
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:06,100
               This way!

537
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:07,301
 Wait! Where are you going?

538
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:08,835
         You're gonna miss
         the slumber party.

539
00:32:08,837 --> 00:32:10,535
  You came back! Yay!

540
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:13,937
 What is happening?

541
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:17,072
   Wait! Where are you going?

542
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,106
          You're gonna miss
          the slumber party.

543
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:20,741
           You came back! Yay!

544
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:21,641
          Oh, my God!
          Oh, my God!

545
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,379
      I don't think
      Billy's the only problem.

546
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,315
                It's the movie.

547
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:31,349
          The movie won't
          let us leave.

548
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:21,258
       Come on, everyone.
       Sing along!

549
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:26,128
Duncan is dead.
       We have to warn them.

550
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,029
 Please. They're morons.

551
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:29,997
 I wanna know where
 they keep the hardware
 in this dump.

552
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,699
 I want chainsaws and
 I want big-ass knives,
 and I want them now.

553
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,667
              What am I gonna
              tell our parents?

554
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,637
 I don't want to
 die here, guys.

555
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:43,274
             Me neither.
             There's got to be
             a way to get home.

556
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,186
 Did I miss
 the <i> Kumbaya</i> circle?

557
00:33:57,188 --> 00:33:58,587
 Paula, you're
 just in time

558
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,889
         to start setting up
         for the slumber party.

559
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,325
           Yeah, we took a vote
           and you get to share
           my sleeping bag.

560
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:06,260
 Thanks, Kurt.
 But I'm saving myself

561
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:07,561
  for someone who
  doesn't have a needle dick.

562
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:10,029
                    Yeah right,
                    it's like

563
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:13,365
                 a hammer dick,
                 if anything.

564
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,232
                  It's a
                  sledgehammer.

565
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:15,733
   Uh, who are they?

566
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:19,970
Oh, they're
 the new counselors.
 They're super nice.

567
00:34:19,972 --> 00:34:21,471
 We don't have new counselors.

568
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:24,507
     Well, now we do.

569
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,976
    All right, guys,
    let's split up into
    groups and get busy.

570
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,010
   Whoo!

571
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:34,014
That's her.
          That's Paula.

572
00:34:34,016 --> 00:34:35,348
        She's the
        final girl, right?

573
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,549
          She's the one
          that kills Billy.

574
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:38,350
 We just have to stay with her
 till the end of the movie.

575
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,485
 I'm sticking to that bitch
 like white on rice.

576
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:43,087
    Okay. Now, we just have
    to keep Billy away from us.

577
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:44,721
It's just
 like Duncan said.

578
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:46,522
               The moment
               a top comes off,
               Billy shows up.

579
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:48,156
Vicki, stick with
              Paula and Tina.
Mmm-hmm.

580
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:50,124
        Gertie, you take Blake.
        Chris, take Kurt.

581
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,458
    No, I want Chris
    to stick with me.

582
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,092
                No, we have to
                cover everyone.

583
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:54,526
        I'll stick with my mom.

584
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,860
           You know that's
           not your mom, right?

585
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,895
Vicki!
    Don't defend her.

586
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:59,696
 This delusional shit
 is gonna get us all killed.

587
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,274
           Ooh! Whoa!

588
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,242
           Look at the
           pair on her!

589
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:16,577
       I would just
       motorboat those
       for hours.

590
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,611
          Yeah, but look
          at those articles,

591
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:20,146
             I could read those
             all night long.

592
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:23,148
 What are you, a fag?

593
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,884
 You don't like some
 nice big hoots?

594
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:27,752
        Hooting!

595
00:35:27,754 --> 00:35:30,321
          My dads are gay.
          So, shut the hell up.

596
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:32,623
 Yeah, right!
 Gay guys can't have kids.

597
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,858
 They're too busy
 going to discos

598
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,192
   and having sex
   with each other.

599
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:37,826
 It's actually
 a pretty cool lifestyle.

600
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,330
           Oh!

601
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:45,931
              Hi.
   Hey.

602
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:47,098
 I really like your pin.

603
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,365
             Oh, thank you.

604
00:35:50,968 --> 00:35:52,268
         Where'd you get yours?

605
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,736
 My friends gave them to me.

606
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:55,404
 Where'd you get yours?

607
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:57,606
       Um, I made it, actually,

608
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:00,908
      at this, like, prison
      pen-pal convention thing.

609
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,276
     Oh, that's awesome!

610
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:05,244
Yeah.

611
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:10,548
 Hey, what's up
 with this cassette?

612
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,815
 There are no holes in it.

613
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:15,384
                 Give me that.

614
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:18,486
 What are these?
                 No, no. Bad!

615
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:21,521
         Not for you. Very bad!

616
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:31,796
            It's too bad
            all the girls
            are so busted, huh?

617
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,264
          The only way you or I
          are going to get any

618
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:34,632
             is with angel eyes
             over there.

619
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,568
 What? Are you nuts?

620
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:43,372
 No, no, no. These girls
 are slamming, my man.

621
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:45,774
  And I am going
  to do all of them.

622
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,243
 Yum! By the way,
 what's with you and Max?

623
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:50,244
 Are you guys...

624
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,648
 Are you guys having sex?

625
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,883
  Because if not,
  I wouldn't mind

626
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,851
 bench pressing her
 with my dumbbell.

627
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:02,053
Oh!
                  Listen, brah,

628
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,854
     you're not bench pressing
     anyone with your dumbbell.

629
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:06,590
        If I so much
        hear your dumbbell
        took a Pilates class...

630
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,291
              What?
               ...I'm gonna
               cut it off.

631
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:11,560
             I swiped a whole
             case of this stuff

632
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,361
                 from my uncle
                 before coming.

633
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:15,329
            I'm gonna need it
            if I'm stuck here
            for the summer

634
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:18,332
         instead of souping up
         this bitching firebird
         I found in...

635
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:19,933
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, great.
 Where do they keep
 the chainsaws here?

636
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:21,934
                    What?

637
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:24,102
 We might want to
 find out, right?
 Where they keep them?

638
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,436
 Because you never know

639
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,205
     when you might
     need a chainsaw.

640
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:30,306
      Why do we need a chainsaw
      for a slumber party?

641
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,309
 I know what's going to
 go down at this camp,

642
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:36,210
 and it's not pretty.

643
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,316
 Uh, so, where's that
 other guy you came with?

644
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:45,317
                     Uh...

645
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:46,885
                 My brother.
        Mmm-hmm.

646
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:48,586
              Yeah, he's, uh...

647
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:51,755
        He's napping somewhere.

648
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:55,524
                Okay, let's go.
                You want to go?

649
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:57,893
                Yeah, let's.
                You got all the
                wood you need.

650
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:16,743
              Mom, no!

651
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,450
             Get dressed. Now.
 Oh, my God, Max!

652
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:28,251
    What are you doing here?
    Get out!

653
00:38:28,253 --> 00:38:29,585
             Nancy, if you go
             through with this,

654
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:30,886
               you're going
               to get hurt.

655
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:34,155
     Kurt said
     he liked me, okay.
     He said it.

656
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:36,290
   Yeah, they always say it,
   they just don't act like it.

657
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,895
       God. You must think
       I'm a total zero.

658
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:53,905
 I just wanted to feel
 grown-up, special.

659
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:59,076
You are special.

660
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,011
   I'm the shy girl
   with the clipboard
   and the guitar.

661
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,045
     Special to who?

662
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:05,581
                 Special to me.

663
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,686
 Who are you, Max?

664
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,790
     Soak this moment in, babe,

665
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,291
          because you're always
          gonna remember me.

666
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:20,292
               Oh, shit.

667
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,726
                     Ooh!

668
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:24,428
      Two for the price of one.

669
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,530
            You babes just
            couldn't wait,
            could you?

670
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,632
         We're leaving.
                Too late.

671
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:31,734
            Genie's already
            out of the bottle.
            Make a wish.

672
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:33,301
          Ew.
     Ew.

673
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:37,437
                   Where's Max?

674
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:39,038
       I don't know.
       Do you hear that?

675
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:57,255
             What'd I say, huh?
             Leave her alone!

676
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:07,163
 Lock the windows!
 Shut the curtains!
 He can see us!

677
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:09,298
                     Who is he?

678
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,733
 Max. You have to
 tell them about Billy.

679
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,068
 Oh, God. He's here.

680
00:40:15,737 --> 00:40:21,107
   Not Billy Murphy?
   I mean, he's just a legend.

681
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:23,042
 Oh! I love legends.

682
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:26,911
 Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
 Bon Jovi. All of them.

683
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,046
  It all happened so long ago.

684
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:47,129
      Little Billy Murphy went
      to camp here decades ago.

685
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:50,765
     And he was always
     picked on for being...

686
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,033
             Um, guys?

687
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,801
      ...different, ugly.

688
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:58,503
         And then one summer...
    This is bad.

689
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:00,705
 ...the hottest one on record,

690
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:03,107
 the counselors decided
 to play a little prank on him.

691
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,976
            What's happening?

692
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:19,387
              Oh.

693
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:22,857
      This is...
      What, are we home?

694
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,158
 Oh, God, why am I colorblind?
 Am I having a stroke?

695
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:29,261
                I think we're
                in a flashback.

696
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,670
<i> It started as</i>
  <i> just another ordinary day.</i>

697
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:45,438
 <i> But little did they know...</i>
              What the hell
              is that voice?

698
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,173
   <i> ...something was about</i>
   <i> to go horribly wrong.</i>

699
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:48,741
      <i> No one really knows</i>
      <i> how Billy was</i>

700
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:51,043
      <i> before it happened.</i>

701
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,945
   <i> The counselors hated him,</i>
   <i> and the other kids</i>
   <i> bullied him mercilessly.</i>

702
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,646
                   Stop!

703
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:56,613
           Where'd you get
           these clothes, huh?

704
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,051
            Guys, that's Billy.
              Come on, Billy.

705
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:07,023
 Hey, what are you
 little idiots doing?

706
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,791
              Billy's in there,
              and he's been
              in there forever.

707
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,793
<i> Billy locked</i>
    <i> himself in the outhouse,</i>

708
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,528
     <i> thinking he'd be safe,</i>
     <i> but he was wrong.</i>

709
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,997
             Billy.
             Billy, open up.

710
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:17,632
                I know how
                to get him out.

711
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:39,217
<i> Billy had third-degree</i>
 <i> burns all over his body</i>

712
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:41,852
     <i> because of</i>
     <i> the counselors' prank.</i>

713
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:45,121
   <i> And the only thing</i>
   <i> that could distract Billy</i>
   <i> from his terrible pain,</i>

714
00:42:45,123 --> 00:42:48,190
   <i> was thinking about</i>
   <i> what had been done to him.</i>

715
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:51,593
     <i> And during those long,</i>
     <i> agonizing nights</i>
     <i> in the burn ward,</i>

716
00:42:51,595 --> 00:42:54,028
  <i> Billy's fear was slowly</i>
  <i> replaced by something else.</i>

717
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,864
<i> Hatred.</i>

718
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,600
       <i> His face would</i>
       <i> never be the same.</i>

719
00:43:00,602 --> 00:43:02,101
     <i> And so, he made a mask</i>

720
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:04,303
       <i> to hide his scars</i>
       <i> on the outside,</i>

721
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:07,439
      <i> but his anger</i>
      <i> grew on the inside.</i>

722
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:10,008
   <i> All Billy wanted was</i>
   <i> to make everyone as afraid</i>

723
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,310
     <i> as he was</i>
     <i> on that terrible day.</i>

724
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:15,145
        <i> He started his</i>
        <i> reign of terror</i>

725
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:17,247
       <i> by returning to</i>
       <i> exact his revenge.</i>

726
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:33,796
        <i> He killed</i>
        <i> eight counselors</i>
        <i> that night.</i>

727
00:43:33,798 --> 00:43:36,632
<i> One for every month</i>
<i> he spent in that hospital bed.</i>

728
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:38,266
       <i> And legend has it</i>
       <i> Billy still lives</i>

729
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:40,334
    <i> in these woods</i>
    <i> in his own little shack,</i>

730
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:42,803
 <i> waiting for new counselors</i>
 <i> to cross his path,</i>

731
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:45,805
     <i> waiting to get revenge</i>
     <i> again and again.</i>

732
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:03,554
       The car! The car!

733
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,322
     Guys, you can't leave!
     Literally!

734
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:16,196
     Get up! Get up! Stop!
     Don't come any closer.

735
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:18,665
 Okay, just listen.
 We can explain.

736
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:21,467
 You can't leave.
 None of us can.

737
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:22,634
 Not until he's dead.

738
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:23,368
       Until who's dead?

739
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,903
  Billy Murphy.
                      What?

740
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,006
   Drive! Drive!

741
00:44:34,177 --> 00:44:35,844
 Look, I'm just
 trying to save you.

742
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:37,912
          Why? Why are you
          trying to save me?

743
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:39,213
 Well, because you're my...

744
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,016
 My first friend here.

745
00:44:47,587 --> 00:44:49,053
 Go, go, go, go,
 go, go, go!

746
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:50,687
                  Help me.
                  I'm not dead!

747
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,822
                Duncan!
                You're alive!

748
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:59,627
 No, you killed Duncan!

749
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:03,864
 Let's just go to a hotel
 and just relax for the night

750
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:05,432
      and maybe we can
      get into something.

751
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,838
       Oh, my God, Kurt!
       Oh, my God!

752
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,673
 Paula! She's alive!

753
00:45:14,675 --> 00:45:15,840
           Paula, don't move!

754
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:24,413
     Shit!

755
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:32,787
              I can't believe
              they're all dead.

756
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:35,756
 They were never alive.

757
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:37,724
  They weren't real.
  Neither are you.

758
00:45:37,726 --> 00:45:40,259
 Because this is just a movie,

759
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:43,795
 and Paula was the only one
 that could kill Billy.

760
00:45:43,797 --> 00:45:45,196
    We're screwed.

761
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,101
            What does she mean,
            "just a movie"?

762
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:00,841
     So, we're in a movie?

763
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:03,810
      But this is
      a horror movie,

764
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:06,479
        and Billy Murphy's
        really after all of us.

765
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:07,947
          Why do I have to wear
          all this stuff again?

766
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:09,615
        Because you're scripted

767
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:11,583
          to do a striptease
          at the slumber party,

768
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:13,985
           and when you
           take your top off,
           Billy comes running.

769
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:16,721
        But why does he
        hate my boobs?

770
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:18,122
    Because they're not big?

771
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:21,024
 So, wait,
 is new wave real?

772
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:23,326
   Yeah. Yeah, of course.

773
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:25,961
  But I'm not real.

774
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:28,496
        You're only real
        in the movie.

775
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:30,830
 So, yeah, you're real here.

776
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:33,432
         Oh, cool.

777
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,933
 Guys, we just
 wanna get home.

778
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:38,001
          But, okay...

779
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,602
      But you said
      Paula was the only one
      who could kill him.

780
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:42,638
    And she just died.

781
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,273
          Exactly. Which is why
          we need to nominate
          a new final girl.

782
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:48,875
      And I'm willing to be it.

783
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:55,914
            What?
     Well, you're not a virgin.

784
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,348
   I am, too, a virgin!

785
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:01,385
       I technically am that...

786
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:02,686
           Whatever, what
           does it matter?

787
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:05,288
  Because it just does, Vicki.

788
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,889
 You have to be
 a virgin in this movie

789
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:08,657
 in order to
 kill Billy, okay?

790
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,827
 And the only
 true-blue virgin here
 is Max.

791
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,329
       I'm not the only virgin.

792
00:47:17,964 --> 00:47:19,297
Gertie,
           you're a virgin.

793
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:21,732
No. Not anymore.

794
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:23,700
 Last summer,
 with that guy Gerry.

795
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:25,301
     He had the like
     weird mustache

796
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:26,302
       and he, like,
       winked, remember?

797
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:27,236
             Isn't he autistic?

798
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:32,806
 Yeah. Yeah, he is.
 But he's also very romantic.

799
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,241
 Damn, superfreak.
 I like!

800
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:38,410
                   Okay, let's
                   make a plan.
    Yeah.

801
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:40,545
We need to
 get Billy's machete.

802
00:47:40,547 --> 00:47:42,046
     The one he's holding?

803
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:43,647
           Yeah. Duncan said
           that's the only
           way to kill him.

804
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:44,914
           Everything else
           just slows him down.

805
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,615
    So, we're supposed to
    just pry it from his hands?

806
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:49,884
 Well, we don't really have
 any other options. Okay?

807
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:52,086
   Look, we just have to get
   his machete into Max's hands

808
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:53,487
             so she can
             chop his head off,
             end the movie,

809
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:54,988
        and we can all go home.

810
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,858
            No. No way!
            I can't do this.

811
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,960
        See? She's even saying
        that she can't do it.

812
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,762
          Vicki! Enough! Jesus!
          Can you just shut up
          for a second?

813
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:05,996
           God! I can't believe
           I put up with you
           for so long.

814
00:48:07,832 --> 00:48:10,133
 Max, you got this.
                        No.

815
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:13,202
          Max. You can do this.

816
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:14,670
     If it wasn't for you,
     we'd all be dead

817
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:16,004
         burning in the theater
         right now.

818
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:17,105
 Yeah, and look
 where I got us.

819
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:21,809
     I can do it. I can
     be the final girl.

820
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,010
    I'm a virgin, too.

821
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:25,212
 I didn't sleep with Kurt.

822
00:48:25,214 --> 00:48:27,314
  So, now I guess I'll
  be able to save myself

823
00:48:27,316 --> 00:48:28,648
       for George Michael
       after all.

824
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,849
            I wouldn't hold
            your breath, honey.

825
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:32,718
          Why?

826
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,387
   It doesn't matter. Nancy,
   you can't be the final girl.

827
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:37,555
          It's not in your DNA,
          or whatever.

828
00:48:37,557 --> 00:48:39,390
            You're the shy girl
            with the clipboard
            and the guitar.

829
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:40,491
              You get laid
              and then you die.

830
00:48:40,493 --> 00:48:41,892
             You're just part
             of the body count.

831
00:48:41,894 --> 00:48:42,993
                    No offense.

832
00:48:48,532 --> 00:48:49,965
           That came out wrong.

833
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,001
     Thanks a lot.
                  Max.

834
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,037
I was just
              trying to help.

835
00:49:07,246 --> 00:49:08,179
        Nancy?

836
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:15,485
         Am I really gonna die?

837
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,524
             Yeah.

838
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:24,459
   So, I guess I never grow up,

839
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:28,462
            or fall in love
            or have kids.

840
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:33,500
      I had this dream that
      when I graduated college,

841
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:35,635
        I would meet a guy.

842
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,738
                And we'd have
                a baby. A girl.

843
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,741
   And if she ever needed me,
   I would do anything for her.

844
00:49:43,743 --> 00:49:44,641
            Anything.

845
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:51,312
         I would've made
         a really great mom.

846
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:55,382
         The best.

847
00:49:59,986 --> 00:50:01,853
       God, this totally sucks!

848
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,754
                 It's so bogus!

849
00:50:03,756 --> 00:50:05,722
            I should have known
            something was up
            with this place.

850
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:07,090
                I mean,
                think about it.

851
00:50:07,092 --> 00:50:09,625
            What the hell
            kind of summer camp
            has waterbeds?

852
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:21,368
             What do we do now?

853
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:27,606
          We fight.

854
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,610
              All right, guys.
              No more junior
              varsity bullshit.

855
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,745
           We gotta lead with
           a pro-style offense.

856
00:50:34,747 --> 00:50:36,546
              Something Billy
              won't see coming.

857
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:38,714
             We have to use
             everything we have
             at our disposal.

858
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,415
           I was thinking
           the best opportunity
           for an ambush

859
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:42,583
             would be
             the slumber party,
             with a few tweaks.

860
00:50:42,585 --> 00:50:44,017
             That means it's
             just a question of

861
00:50:44,019 --> 00:50:45,485
           luring him here at
           just the right time.

862
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:46,586
              How are we going
              to do that?

863
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:47,553
        I think I have an idea.

864
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:51,489
"Operation
             Booby Trap?"

865
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:54,625
Yup. And Tina's
 going to be the bait.

866
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
 Vicki, are you crying?

867
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:47,074
    I'm fine.

868
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:55,714
 Gertie, I'm sorry for
 that time in junior high

869
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:58,116
 when I told everyone
 to start calling you
 "Ba-chunk-adunk."

870
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:00,284
 And then I covered
 your locker in bacon.

871
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:02,686
 That was so crappy.

872
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:04,454
  And I'm so sorry.

873
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,022
 I'm such a bad person.

874
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,790
         You're not. It's okay.

875
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,625
                If it makes you
                feel better,

876
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,593
       last summer, I'm the one
       who spread the rumor

877
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:13,760
              that said you had
              a weird disease

878
00:52:13,762 --> 00:52:14,861
         where you're
         always on your period.

879
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:17,696
 Wow. That's evil.

880
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:18,796
               Thank you.

881
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,834
 Hey, Max, if I'm
 going to die tonight,

882
00:52:24,836 --> 00:52:26,468
 then I don't want to die
 without telling you

883
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:31,806
 that when your mom died,
 you shut down completely.

884
00:52:33,074 --> 00:52:34,774
    And just cut me
    out of your life.

885
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:38,844
 And I missed you.
 I missed our friendship.

886
00:52:40,213 --> 00:52:42,247
  And then you two
  became best friends

887
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:44,549
 and, I don't know,
 I got jealous.

888
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:46,851
 And so, I did
 some really bad things

889
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,686
 and I'm not proud of them.

890
00:52:48,688 --> 00:52:51,188
              Vicki.
 No, no, no, just
 let me finish, okay.

891
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,557
 I know that I've become a...

892
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:54,891
                      A bitch?

893
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:56,626
    Yes, thank you.

894
00:52:56,628 --> 00:53:01,163
 But the thing is, Max,
 I've always looked up to you

895
00:53:01,165 --> 00:53:03,165
 because you were
 always the brave one.

896
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,199
 So, be brave again.

897
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:09,601
            Vicki, you don't
            have to die.

898
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:13,904
   I'm the mean girl in
   the '80s horror movie.

899
00:53:13,906 --> 00:53:16,339
    And we're
    past the mid-point,
    so, you know,

900
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:20,709
 I'd say that I've
 overstayed my welcome.

901
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,653
Ooh!

902
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:38,789
       Oh, no, no, no!
       Uh-uh. No. No, Tina.

903
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:41,958
 Tina, hey. Yeah. No.

904
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,760
 You know not to take off
 any of your clothes until
 we say so, right?

905
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:48,596
           Yeah? No sex.

906
00:53:48,598 --> 00:53:50,364
How could anyone
      think about sex

907
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:51,765
             when I have this
             rad gadget?

908
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:53,866
        What is this
        thing, anyway?

909
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:54,733
               It's a phone.

910
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,337
       Yeah. Please,
       I'm not that gullible.

911
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,440
      Um, hello, operator? Yes,
      I'm trying to make a call

912
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:05,774
               but I can't

913
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:07,709
     because my phone's
     not plugged into anything.

914
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,443
           Oh, my God, kill me.

915
00:54:10,445 --> 00:54:12,378
        Guys, it's almost time.
        Let's get ready.

916
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,512
Okay.

917
00:54:17,816 --> 00:54:18,715
 How you holding up?

918
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,250
               Been better.
               How about you?

919
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,954
 I'm really scared.

920
00:54:27,956 --> 00:54:29,456
 Uh...

921
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,857
 Uh, are the arrows ready?

922
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:34,193
               Yeah, I'm on it.

923
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,767
      "Adderall."

924
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:55,242
 God, your parents must be
 freaking out right now.

925
00:54:55,244 --> 00:54:56,876
  You've been
  gone for hours.

926
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,278
 They must be
 so worried about you.

927
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,779
                Not really.

928
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,681
          I never knew my dad.
          And my mom's away.

929
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:07,885
   What's she like?

930
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:13,723
         She, uh... She was so
         beautiful and funny.

931
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,993
       She never knew
       how awesome she was.

932
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:20,328
    How'd she die?

933
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,330
         I never said she died.
 You said "was."

934
00:55:23,332 --> 00:55:26,366
 So, I just figured.

935
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:27,867
 It's okay. You don't
 have to tell me.

936
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:32,003
 Here, I want you
 to have this.

937
00:55:36,508 --> 00:55:39,509
 It's a friendship bracelet.
 So, you don't forget me.

938
00:55:40,777 --> 00:55:42,977
   How could I ever forget you?

939
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:47,547
 You know,
 if this all works out,

940
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:49,382
 I'm really gonna miss you.

941
00:55:49,384 --> 00:55:50,716
 When you go home, I mean.

942
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:54,852
 Oh, God, I sound
 totally molded.

943
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:56,753
 I know we just met,
 it's silly for me
 to say that.

944
00:55:56,755 --> 00:55:59,355
 It's just...
 I guess it's like,

945
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,023
 who am I going to
 talk to after you leave?

946
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,858
     You know? Tina?

947
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,460
She's not very smart.

948
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,931
              Maybe you
              don't have to.
 I don't?

949
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,499
 I mean, I carpool
 with her to camp,

950
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,133
 it's kind of inevitable.

951
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:16,069
       No, I mean, maybe you
       don't have to stay here.

952
00:56:16,071 --> 00:56:18,571
     Look, I know in the movie,
     you're supposed to die,

953
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:19,772
          but that doesn't mean
          you have to, right?

954
00:56:20,874 --> 00:56:22,341
         Right.

955
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:24,242
          And if you don't die,

956
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:25,676
          then that means
          you'll be around at
          the end of the movie,

957
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:26,843
               when we leave.

958
00:56:27,244 --> 00:56:29,144
         Right.

959
00:56:29,146 --> 00:56:32,580
       So, then who's to say
       you can't just come home
       with me?

960
00:56:33,815 --> 00:56:34,848
     Oh, my God.

961
00:56:36,817 --> 00:56:38,083
         Where's home?
               The Valley.

962
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:40,484
    The Valley.

963
00:56:42,387 --> 00:56:43,919
 I don't know, Max,
 I don't know.

964
00:56:43,921 --> 00:56:46,121
  You're just... You're kind of
  blowing my mind right now.

965
00:56:46,123 --> 00:56:47,589
            No, think about it!

966
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:50,692
                  If you come
                  home with me,

967
00:56:50,694 --> 00:56:52,593
              you can be
              whoever you want.

968
00:56:52,595 --> 00:56:53,927
       You don't have to be
       the shy girl

969
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:55,762
            with the clipboard
            and the guitar.

970
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:57,764
        You could be...
 I could, like, go to college.

971
00:56:57,766 --> 00:56:59,599
 And drive a convertible.
                Right. Totally!

972
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:01,500
  An go shopping at the mall.

973
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,601
              Actually, people
              don't really shop

974
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:03,935
              at malls anymore.
              They shop online.

975
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:04,769
     What's online?

976
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:08,139
    Never mind, I made that up.
    Just keep going!

977
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:11,809
 Okay! I wanna shop online
 and I wanna start over.

978
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:14,711
 You know, I could be
 different in the Valley.

979
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,558
        What if I don't
        make it, Max?

980
00:57:32,595 --> 00:57:34,028
           This time, you will.

981
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,863
Hey, guys.

982
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:40,667
               Hi. So sorry
               to interrupt,

983
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,835
          but, um, we have
          a bit of a situation.

984
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,408
           Tina, are you...
 I'm great! I'm amazing!

985
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,343
        She ate your Adderall?

986
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,211
  Tina, hey. Eyes here.

987
00:57:55,712 --> 00:57:56,645
            Hmm.

988
00:57:57,346 --> 00:57:58,746
           Yes.

989
00:57:58,748 --> 00:58:01,682
 How many of my, um,
 Tic Tacs did you have?

990
00:58:01,684 --> 00:58:05,052
     They're not Tic Tacs!
     And I had, um, three.

991
00:58:05,054 --> 00:58:07,354
         No, 10 or 30!

992
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:09,589
         It was 30!
          Maybe we need
          to re-strategize.

993
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:12,091
        No, no, no.
        I got this.
        I got this.

994
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:13,758
     Tina.

995
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,126
 Are you sure you can...

996
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:18,062
       Look, man, I got
       this, all right?

997
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:21,197
       I got this!
       I so got this.

998
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:23,732
She'll be fine.

999
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,500
     I really think
     she's more focused now.

1000
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,335
          Right, Tina?
              Yes!

1001
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:32,972
             Guys. Let's start.

1002
00:58:38,344 --> 00:58:41,679
  All right, guys.
  This is it. Sound off. Ready.

1003
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:44,648
      Ready! Ready! Ready!

1004
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:45,882
Totem pole?

1005
00:58:45,884 --> 00:58:47,083
Ready!

1006
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:48,918
Stereo?
             Ready.

1007
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,486
- Arrows?
- Ready!

1008
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:56,191
      All right then, Nancy,
      unleash the beast.

1009
01:00:03,276 --> 01:00:05,176
      Oh, my God.
      Oh, my God, he's coming.
      He's coming!

1010
01:00:05,178 --> 01:00:07,478
                 He's coming!
   Not yet. Wait to move!

1011
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,446
         No, no! He's so close!

1012
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:13,983
Tina!

1013
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:17,085
                Cut the rope!

1014
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,293
                      Gertie.
          Yeah?

1015
01:00:30,495 --> 01:00:31,561
                I love you.

1016
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:33,629
         Oh, screw it.

1017
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:03,657
     Everybody in the kitchen!
     Now! Now! Go now!

1018
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:11,096
            It's okay.
            It's gonna be fine.

1019
01:01:14,267 --> 01:01:16,033
   Gertie, come on.
   Hurry up!

1020
01:01:21,105 --> 01:01:22,171
Go!

1021
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:41,822
Go, go, go! Go!

1022
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:45,324
 Come on, Nancy. Come on.

1023
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:54,964
       Shit!

1024
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:56,832
   It's stuck!

1025
01:02:04,673 --> 01:02:06,106
                We're stuck!
                We're stuck!

1026
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,174
No!

1027
01:02:20,285 --> 01:02:21,818
 Max, it's okay.

1028
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,420
    Just go.

1029
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:31,125
Go.

1030
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:08,223
What's happening?

1031
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,895
              It's slow motion.

1032
01:04:15,956 --> 01:04:19,758
Jump!

1033
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,171
Flashback!
        Flashback! Flashback!
What?

1034
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,906
 Just say the words!
               What words?

1035
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:39,974
         Billy Murphy was a kid
         who went to camp here
         years ago.

1036
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:42,577
            Tell me the
            story again! Hurry!

1037
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,111
 He was always picked on
 for being different, ugly.

1038
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,612
Keep going.
             Don't stop!

1039
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:47,347
 And then one summer,
 the hottest one on record,

1040
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:49,182
  the kids decided to play
  a little prank on him.

1041
01:04:56,556 --> 01:04:58,022
     Where the hell are we?

1042
01:04:58,024 --> 01:04:59,089
  A flashback!
                   A flashback!

1043
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:01,990
           Does that mean
           we're safe?

1044
01:05:15,368 --> 01:05:17,735
 Holy crap,
 this thing is heavy.

1045
01:05:20,037 --> 01:05:22,004
Guys,
 where's Billy?

1046
01:05:22,006 --> 01:05:23,605
<i> Billy locked</i>
    <i> himself in the outhouse,</i>

1047
01:05:23,607 --> 01:05:25,473
   <i> thinking he'd be safe,</i>
   <i> but he was wrong.</i>

1048
01:05:25,475 --> 01:05:26,841
            Oh, my God,
            that's me!

1049
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:28,142
                Ugh.

1050
01:05:28,144 --> 01:05:31,078
            That's what
            I sound like?

1051
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,484
- Look at him run!
- Wait.

1052
01:05:38,486 --> 01:05:39,651
 Where's Billy going?

1053
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,385
                      Wait.

1054
01:05:56,734 --> 01:05:58,367
       I don't know
       that part of camp.

1055
01:05:58,369 --> 01:05:59,601
 I've never seen
 that cabin before.

1056
01:06:05,274 --> 01:06:07,507
             Shit! End the
             flashback! End it!

1057
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,075
 Just skip to the end!

1058
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:10,709
   Legend has it Billy
   still lives in these woods

1059
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:12,544
 waiting for new counselors
 to cross his path,

1060
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:14,279
    waiting to get
    revenge again and again.

1061
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:19,216
   Did we leave him there?

1062
01:06:19,218 --> 01:06:21,518
                 I wouldn't
                 count on it.
                 Let's move.

1063
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:37,597
   Oh, my God!
   Are you okay?

1064
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:39,298
                Yeah, I'm fine.

1065
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,799
Max!

1066
01:06:40,801 --> 01:06:43,234
Max!
                  No!

1067
01:06:43,236 --> 01:06:44,902
     Let me go! Let me go!

1068
01:06:44,904 --> 01:06:46,603
               She's gone, Max.
   No! She's alive! She's...

1069
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:48,171
               Max, she's gone.

1070
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,240
       No. She's not.

1071
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:57,477
Come on.

1072
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:25,100
 Keep pressure on it.
 Don't move, I'll be back.

1073
01:07:25,734 --> 01:07:27,067
               Max, she's dead.

1074
01:07:29,637 --> 01:07:32,271
    She's supposed to die,
    just like the rest of them.

1075
01:07:32,273 --> 01:07:33,939
       No, she's lived
       this far into the movie,

1076
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:35,106
        longer than she
        ever has before.

1077
01:07:35,108 --> 01:07:36,474
                She's not real.

1078
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:39,009
          None of this is real.

1079
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:40,076
    Yes, she is!

1080
01:07:40,078 --> 01:07:41,310
                     Max, wait.

1081
01:07:45,414 --> 01:07:47,348
                  I don't wanna
                  die alone.

1082
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:55,620
 Listen to me.
 You're not gonna die.

1083
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,322
 Nobody else is
 dying tonight.

1084
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,492
           I know exactly where
           he's taken her.

1085
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:37,144
            Hey, Nancy.

1086
01:09:40,647 --> 01:09:42,614
         Max? Max!

1087
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,723
 He was right there.

1088
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:32,353
          No!

1089
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:44,895
            Get up!

1090
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:48,898
      Come on, let's
      get out of here.

1091
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:51,466
              Come on, come on.

1092
01:11:03,678 --> 01:11:05,078
Chris.

1093
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,479
Max, over here.

1094
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:09,214
      Sit down.

1095
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,520
                  Am I dying?

1096
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,421
 No. I know how to fix it.

1097
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:22,223
 You're not the
 final girl yet, Max.

1098
01:11:22,225 --> 01:11:24,391
    Because of me.
    I'm still alive.

1099
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:26,792
                    No.
   Yes.

1100
01:11:26,794 --> 01:11:30,262
         No! I'm already dying,
         so you could survive!

1101
01:11:30,264 --> 01:11:32,130
     You can be the final girl.

1102
01:11:32,132 --> 01:11:35,099
      No, Max. No.

1103
01:11:35,101 --> 01:11:37,968
 That's not who
 I'm supposed to be,
 remember?

1104
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,837
 I'm just the shy girl
 with the clipboard
 and the guitar.

1105
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,438
           Yeah, but you wanted
           to change that.

1106
01:11:43,406 --> 01:11:45,440
 Honey, let me do this.

1107
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,808
                        No.

1108
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:51,344
    Max, I'm not afraid.

1109
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:56,348
          I wanted to save you.

1110
01:11:57,383 --> 01:12:00,651
       Oh, Max, you did.

1111
01:12:01,886 --> 01:12:04,120
         You did, Max.

1112
01:12:04,122 --> 01:12:07,288
    Just by letting me
    be here with you.

1113
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:12,292
 I've never felt more real
 or more alive ever before.

1114
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,861
                          No.

1115
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:16,963
            No, Mom, you belong
            at home, with me.

1116
01:12:18,632 --> 01:12:22,801
        Look, your name is
        Amanda Cartwright,
        and you live in Encino,

1117
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:25,904
              and you love
              <i> Bette Davis Eyes</i>
              and Mel's Diner.

1118
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:29,641
        And you wanted to be
        the biggest movie star,

1119
01:12:29,643 --> 01:12:31,109
             more than anything
             in the world.

1120
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:35,612
And
           you had a daughter.

1121
01:12:39,183 --> 01:12:40,483
           You have a daughter.

1122
01:12:45,389 --> 01:12:47,021
             I'm not going back
             without you.

1123
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:52,691
                I don't wanna
                lose you again.

1124
01:12:53,726 --> 01:12:54,826
             Max.

1125
01:12:57,095 --> 01:13:01,564
       I'm not lost.
       I'm right here,
       all right?

1126
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:03,599
 You'll always know
 where to find me, okay?

1127
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:06,667
 But you have to let me go.

1128
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:09,636
 You have to let me go.

1129
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,523
           Bye, Max.

1130
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,432
               I love you.

1131
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:51,603
               That's what
               I never got
               to tell her.

1132
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:54,138
          Don't worry.

1133
01:13:55,507 --> 01:13:58,542
         Wherever she is,
         she knows.

1134
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:01,744
     You were right about
     one thing, you know?

1135
01:14:02,679 --> 01:14:03,745
                    What?

1136
01:14:04,646 --> 01:14:06,647
     I'm a movie star.

1137
01:16:49,115 --> 01:16:50,815
      You just fucked
      with the wrong virgin.

1138
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:58,095
              It's over.

1139
01:19:30,761 --> 01:19:32,061
  What is happening?

1140
01:19:32,063 --> 01:19:33,028
                I don't know.

1141
01:19:40,603 --> 01:19:41,768
       Hold on tight!

1142
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:22,035
This food
              is so disgusting.

1143
01:20:22,037 --> 01:20:23,536
Speak for yourself, girl.

1144
01:20:23,538 --> 01:20:26,005
           This tapioca pudding
           is incredible!

1145
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:28,774
You've had
           like 15 of those in
           the last 30 minutes.

1146
01:20:28,776 --> 01:20:31,143
            I counted them, 15!

1147
01:20:31,145 --> 01:20:33,545
Little known fact,
 I can't stand tapioca pudding.

1148
01:20:33,547 --> 01:20:35,013
Then why
                 did you eat 30
                 of them?

1149
01:20:35,015 --> 01:20:36,414
Let me eat my
             feelings in peace.

1150
01:20:37,549 --> 01:20:38,749
Max!
      Hey!

1151
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:40,782
 You're awake!

1152
01:20:49,089 --> 01:20:50,922
When you get a second,
 try the pudding.

1153
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:54,725
   Wait, where are we?

1154
01:20:54,727 --> 01:20:56,827
                   We're home.

1155
01:21:00,364 --> 01:21:01,630
 But was it a dream or...

1156
01:21:01,632 --> 01:21:03,164
  No, not at all!

1157
01:21:03,166 --> 01:21:05,099
      Remember?
                 Ugh.

1158
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:07,501
 That is a machete wound,

1159
01:21:07,503 --> 01:21:09,970
 poorly stitched
 by an incompetent doctor.

1160
01:21:09,972 --> 01:21:11,871
        I'm actually more
        concerned about tetanus

1161
01:21:11,873 --> 01:21:13,873
       because the machete
       had a bit of rust on it,

1162
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:16,809
     and I did not see
     the doctor give me a shot.

1163
01:21:16,811 --> 01:21:20,946
         Duncan, I love you
         and I'm so happy
         you survived,

1164
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:22,447
but do you hear yourself
       when you say things?
God.

1165
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:23,614
          Do you hear the words
          in your head first?

1166
01:21:23,616 --> 01:21:25,449
And she's back.

1167
01:21:25,451 --> 01:21:27,050
I feel like
        the jock at high school

1168
01:21:27,052 --> 01:21:28,384
              just gave me
              his promise ring.

1169
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,105
               Doctor, stop.
          Oh, come on.

1170
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,841
My shift's
 almost over.

1171
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:56,509
I have
 to do my rounds.

1172
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:58,511
      And what beautiful
      rounds they are.

1173
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,246
     Oh, my God.
     Of course.

1174
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:07,250
    Of course, what?

1175
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,357
             The sequel!

1176
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:22,362
  This is so great!

1177
01:22:22,364 --> 01:22:23,629
             The sequel is
             so much cooler
             than the original.

1178
01:22:31,603 --> 01:22:32,869
               Mark.

1179
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:36,138
 Let me just
 wipe my sweat off
 with this tampon.

1180
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,139
Blooper!

1181
01:22:40,842 --> 01:22:44,411
    How about you
    go suck a turd?

1182
01:22:44,413 --> 01:22:47,147
              That's perfect,
              so perfectly bad.

1183
01:22:47,149 --> 01:22:51,283
 Like that's <i> Bad.</i>
 Michael Jackson <i> Bad?</i>
 That guy's talented.

1184
01:22:51,285 --> 01:22:52,617
              King of Pop.
        Yeah.

1185
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:57,521
         Wasn't expecting that.

1186
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:07,728
              No!
      Shit.

1187
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:08,395
It's broken!

1188
01:23:11,432 --> 01:23:14,567
 Oh, God, you killed Duncan.
 You smell great, by the way.

1189
01:23:15,235 --> 01:23:17,135
 Oh, you killed him!

1190
01:23:17,137 --> 01:23:18,436
   I promise I won't
   tell the cops

1191
01:23:18,438 --> 01:23:19,336
       if we just
       go have sex!

1192
01:23:19,837 --> 01:23:21,504
 Right now! Now!

1193
01:23:27,276 --> 01:23:28,309
 I'm not even scared.

1194
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:33,747
                      Oh, God,
                      Jesus.

1195
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:36,115
Oh.
                    Chris.

1196
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:37,783
         One more time!

1197
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:41,384
 I've only had sex one time

1198
01:23:41,386 --> 01:23:43,152
        and it was with
        my cousin Heather!

1199
01:23:43,154 --> 01:23:45,521
 Honestly, that
 wasn't your fault,

1200
01:23:45,523 --> 01:23:48,123
 and I won't
 tell the cops
 if we have sex.

1201
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:50,558
Let's

1202
01:23:54,761 --> 01:23:57,662
 Look, Chris, you and I
 don't know each other well.

1203
01:23:57,664 --> 01:23:59,630
 So, lose the familiarity.

1204
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:02,398
   What a rude little
   girl you're being.

1205
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:07,735
 She's not like this at home.
 She's just showing off.

1206
01:24:09,003 --> 01:24:10,870
 You guys have to learn
 how to not break.

1207
01:24:10,872 --> 01:24:13,839
<i> I'm scared.</i>

1208
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:15,941
  Oh, I get it, because
  you've only had sex
  with one person

1209
01:24:15,943 --> 01:24:19,277
   and I'm freaking
   double-digits slayer
   over here.

1210
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:20,811
 You probably don't
 even know this move.

1211
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:27,683
    I feel like I'm
    walking out like Kramer.

1212
01:24:29,585 --> 01:24:30,484
                 Jerry.

1213
01:24:33,587 --> 01:24:37,122
            Well, all my
            bones are broken
            except for the one.

1214
01:24:37,124 --> 01:24:39,457
I'm actually
        talking about this arm.

1215
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:41,725
              My penis is
              severely injured.

1216
01:24:41,727 --> 01:24:43,727
         It's like split in
         three different parts.

1217
01:24:52,434 --> 01:24:54,101
       Okay, okay,
       people are dying.

1218
01:24:54,103 --> 01:24:55,936
Oh, my God!

1219
01:24:57,704 --> 01:24:59,571
             It's not "Ew."

1220
01:24:59,573 --> 01:25:01,139
It's not "Ew."

1221
01:25:03,108 --> 01:25:04,441
               Too sexy?
               Was it too sexy?

1222
01:25:05,576 --> 01:25:07,176
<i> Impossible.</i>

1223
01:25:07,178 --> 01:25:08,810
 Ever since
 I was a little boy,

1224
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:10,812
I've dreamed of being
 the final girl.

1225
01:25:14,282 --> 01:25:17,183
      I want you to come study.

1226
01:25:21,219 --> 01:25:22,252
                 One more time.

1227
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:28,490
 Well, Vicki, you're a virgin.
 No, you're not, you're a slut.

1228
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:33,326
He had, like,
 the weird mustache.

1229
01:25:37,497 --> 01:25:38,630
Yeah, right!

1230
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,231
             A phone that I can
             put in my mouth?

1231
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:46,667
Oh!

1232
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:49,436
                From the movie.

1233
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:51,202
                    Oh, Jesus!

1234
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,639
Ow!

1235
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,844
            All right,
            see you in there.

1236
01:26:11,717 --> 01:26:12,450
              That's a cut!
