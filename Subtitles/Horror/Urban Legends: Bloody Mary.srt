1
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,730
- I don't know.
- Seriously, I don't think...

2
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,800
This is stupid.

3
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
God, Grace.

4
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,600
Thank you, it's beautiful.

5
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,950
Thanks.

6
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,080
You look great.

7
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,740
How did Dawn take the news?
The break-up and all.

8
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,840
She'll get over it.

9
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,590
Don't you move. Be right back.

10
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,000
Time for the girls
to get a little shut-eye.

11
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,770
This one's for the hippie chick.
Oh, yeah.

12
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,660
Thank you.

13
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,090
Here you go.

14
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,200
Sorry. I was so thirsty.

15
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,670
Everyone is staring at us.

16
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,550
You are so much more beautiful
than you think you are.

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,430
You want to go someplace
more comfortable?

18
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,310
You want to go someplace?

19
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,060
I didn't even know the door
was there.

20
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,400
- All right, here we go.
- I don't feel well.

21
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,270
Let me go. Stop.

22
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,770
Mary, help.

23
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,770
What's going on?

24
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,050
Do you think he would
ever touch you?

25
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,780
No!

26
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,460
Willy!

27
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,090
- Get her! She's sober. She'll squeal.
- Willy, get up, man.

28
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,540
Come on, Mary!

29
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,310
Help!

30
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,610
Mary!

31
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,010
Mary! Mary!

32
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,120
Mary!

33
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,430
Come on, Mary.

34
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,580
We're just having some fun.

35
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,180
- Let's just talk.
- Get away from me.

36
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,950
Hey.

37
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,940
Come on.

38
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,050
It's gonna be all right. Your friends
are okay. It's all right, it's okay.

39
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,850
It's just a little prank.

40
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,870
Come on.

41
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,470
Let's go check on your friends.

42
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,210
You stupid bitch!

43
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,590
Mary?

44
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,190
Mary.

45
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,100
Oh, shit.

46
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,860
Oh, shit.

47
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,450
I'm sorry.

48
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,350
Oh, shit.

49
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,120
Oh, shit.

50
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,440
There you are.

51
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,940
Where's the girl?

52
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,620
I don't know. I thought she
was in here, but she's not.

53
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,620
- Shit.
- She probably passed out somewhere.

54
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,590
Come on, we gotta find her.

55
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,090
That was over 30 years ago,
but her rotting body is still there...

56
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,100
...waiting to be discovered.

57
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,930
Bullshit.

58
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,830
Bullshit.

59
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,640
No, it's true. I swear to God. My mom
told me in complete confidence.

60
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,570
Well, complete confidence...

61
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,810
...doesn't mean much when
you drink vodka like it's water.

62
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,400
Shut up.

63
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,320
- Stop it!
- So you don't think it's unhealthy...

64
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,820
...for them to stay home
on their own homecoming?

65
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,720
Not everybody wants to
be homecoming queen.

66
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,490
It didn't hurt me.

67
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,690
You're right.

68
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,530
- And I only wish I could've been there.
- No, you were too old and serious.

69
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,330
Thanks a lot.

70
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,500
That story doesn't make any sense.

71
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,940
I mean, why don't the girls stick
up for themselves? I don't get it.

72
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,680
Maybe if you weren't always speaking
out, like in the school newspaper...

73
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,610
...maybe we'd have dates
to the homecoming dance.

74
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,750
Okay, so you changed your mind.

75
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,820
You think it's fair football players
get academic credit...

76
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,320
...for going to practice?

77
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,010
You shouldn't have published
the picture with the article.

78
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,060
They took the picture as a joke. You
published it out of context, without...

79
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,120
Guys. I've got another ghost story.

80
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,900
That wasn't a ghost story, Mindy.
It's an urban legend.

81
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,900
An urban legend is a made-up story
people keep telling as if it was true.

82
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,540
Like the guy who eats Pop Rocks...

83
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
...drinks soda
and his stomach explodes.

84
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,540
Like that bullshit about Mindy's
brother's camp counselor...

85
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,080
...getting his arm stuck in a soda
machine, and it falls on top of him.

86
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,380
That wasn't bullshit.

87
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,880
And it was a candy machine.

88
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,220
- Oh, and like Bloody Mary.
- Who's that?

89
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,560
Supposedly, if you go into
the bathroom and turn off the lights...

90
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,960
...and chant "Bloody Mary" three times
into the mirror, she appears.

91
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,660
Her face is like a corpse.
And if you look at her, well...

92
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,330
...then you have to turn the lights
back on before she drags you in.

93
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,070
In where?

94
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,310
I don't know. In the mirror?

95
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,830
I heard she'll haunt you forever.

96
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,310
That's not even a real urban legend.
That's just like that movie Candyman.

97
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,410
- Well, my story was real.
- As real as your mother's new tits.

98
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,390
What's the first thing you'll do
when you're mayor?

99
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,860
- I haven't won yet.
- But you will.

100
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,060
A lot can happen, so...

101
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,190
But so far...

102
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,300
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

103
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,150
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do
is propose a 9 p.m. curfew...

104
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,120
...on all teenage girls.

105
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,480
I'll keep them off the streets,
keep them safe.

106
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,220
Keep them virgins.

107
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,620
I'm afraid that might be too late.

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,940
Bloody Mary.

109
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,970
Bloody Mary.

110
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,350
Bloody Mary.

111
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,950
Who is it?

112
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,400
David.

113
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,860
Asshole.

114
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,210
So, David, you're back early.
Shouldn't you be at the dance?

115
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,170
- I'm sure it's still going on.
- Oh, yeah. Well...

116
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,510
I was there long enough
not to see any of you.

117
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,180
We didn't want to go that
stupid popularity contest.

118
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,850
And why is that?
Oh, because you couldn't get dates?

119
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,310
Yep, that's exactly what happened.
Football team put us on the blacklist.

120
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,320
We could've gone.

121
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,310
We just preferred to stay here
and have some female bonding.

122
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,320
Hey, Mindy. Nice.

123
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,960
- Shut up.
- David!

124
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,030
Oh, and just so you guys
get it right...

125
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,960
...Candyman ripped off Bloody Mary
in the first place.

126
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,400
Not the other way around.

127
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,940
How long was your brother
outside listening to us?

128
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,710
- Long enough to masturbate.
- Not long at all, then.

129
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,100
David.

130
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,740
So how was it?

131
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,450
Just like yours, I'm sure.

132
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,580
You didn't wake up naked in Tijuana.

133
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,420
Just because there's a dead
Mexican hooker in my room...

134
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,280
...doesn't mean I went to Mexico.

135
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,420
Oh, Bill drank all my lemonade.

136
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,760
David, be nice. You know, and you
could call him "Dad" once in a while.

137
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,290
Never happen.

138
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,400
But I still call you "Mom."

139
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,370
Mom, I need 100 bucks.

140
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,910
Do me a favor.
Go wake up the girls.

141
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,950
All right. Just because you own me,
it doesn't mean I'm your slave.

142
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,070
- Go.
- Yeah.

143
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,380
They're already gone.

144
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,880
She's never done this before.
I mean, this is so unusual for her.

145
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,210
- I have to call Sheriff McKenna.
- Okay.

146
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,280
Yeah, Sheriff McKenna.

147
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,220
It's Bill Owens.

148
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,720
Any word, anything?

149
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,220
We're doing all we can.
You have to understand...

150
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,620
...they're not officially
missing for 24 hours.

151
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,130
- Yeah, but they are missing.
- Hello.

152
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,700
That's it, nothing? All right, well,
you just stay on top of this.

153
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,840
All right, look, when
do we call in the FBI?

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,400
Our hands are tied.
We'll do all we can locally.

155
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,410
- officially missing for 24 hours.

156
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,700
But they are missing.

157
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,570
Right this way, sheriff.

158
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,020
- Sheriff. Thanks for coming.
- Hi, Bill.

159
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,710
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

160
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,700
The mountain gorilla.

161
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,950
An endangered species native
to Central Africa. Mountain gorillas...

162
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,610
...live in groups...

163
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,620
...ruled by a dominant male...

164
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,350
...which determines
the group's daily activities...

165
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,060
...and enforces
a very strict social order.

166
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,630
The silverback.

167
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,470
Do you think Samantha
and her friends are okay?

168
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,970
Yeah.

169
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,500
- and consume 20 times
their weight in food annually.

170
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,380
I just spoke to Sheriff McKenna,
and he's got all his men out searching.

171
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,450
- They're gonna find her.
- Sure, that's easy for you to say.

172
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,920
She's just your stepdaughter.

173
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,790
What...?

174
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,570
Sam.

175
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,470
Oh, my God!

176
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,090
Oh, my God.

177
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,120
They all say the same thing.
They woke up in the basement...

178
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,830
...of the abandoned old mill
on the other side of the state park.

179
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,260
The door was locked.
Well, that's what they said.

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
What do you mean?

181
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,730
Well, we're gonna check it out.
They don't remember anything.

182
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,300
Other than that, they're fine. Weren't
harmed or mistreated, nothing.

183
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,740
We ran blood tests and found
traces of Rohypnol in their system.

184
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,710
It's a date-rape drug.

185
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,450
You don't have to worry about that.
We ran medical tests.

186
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,850
They were not abused in that way.

187
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,990
So, what do you think?

188
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,850
Well, it could be the girls' idea
of a practical joke.

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,230
You know, for attention.

190
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,690
What happened?

191
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,300
What happened? What's wrong?

192
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,030
What's wrong?
What happened to you?

193
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,350
My mom says that it's all a stunt.
That they did it to themselves.

194
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,960
Samantha will write a story
about it for the paper.

195
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,550
Some people have no boundaries.

196
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,790
Some people need to mind
their own fucking business.

197
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,110
The girls are back.

198
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,610
They were in science class.

199
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,050
Took them long enough.

200
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,930
You'd think twins would have
some kind of sixth sense...

201
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,240
...like I'd know what happened to you.

202
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,570
We're fraternal, not identical.

203
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,840
How you holding up?

204
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,930
It was Buck and his friends,
wasn't it?

205
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,640
He told us they just wanted to talk.

206
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,680
You are butt-white.

207
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,650
- Hey, Roger.
- What?

208
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,460
You need to spend some more time
at that tanning salon.

209
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,890
Hey, girls dig it, man.

210
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,560
He doesn't go to that salon
to go tanning.

211
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,530
He goes to hook up with that chick.

212
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,760
- The one with the big tits.
- Oh, yeah.

213
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
Buck.

214
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,940
- What's up?
- Come here. Come here, check it out.

215
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,430
What? Oh, yeah.

216
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,710
I know it was you. All of you.
I know it was all of you.

217
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,150
What did your sister...?

218
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,390
We don't know what
you're talking about.

219
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,910
We were at the dance all night.
Ask our dates.

220
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,030
- Get out of here, loser.
- You little punk.

221
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,690
- Yeah. Get out of here.
- Get out of here, man.

222
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,360
- Get lost.
- You're not gonna get away with this.

223
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,160
- Whatever.
- Oh, I'm scared.

224
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,970
- Come on, get out of here.
- That's what I thought.

225
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,730
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

226
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,000
- We got a problem.
- This is not a problem at all.

227
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,240
Those bitches,
they won't say anything.

228
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,750
Yeah. Take Buck's advice.

229
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,450
What did you get
on your SATs, Buck? Seven hundred?

230
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,250
Total.

231
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,850
What's that supposed to mean?

232
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,550
You're such an asshole.

233
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,740
She needs to relax.

234
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,980
See you later, mama's boy.

235
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,540
Shut up. Shut up.

236
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,270
No way. Shut up.

237
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,020
Yeah. Totally. Shut up.

238
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,260
She did not. No way.

239
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,630
Oh, my God. He's here.
I gotta let you go.

240
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,640
Hi, Roger.

241
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,970
Hi, Betsy. I hope it's okay
I just showed up.

242
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,170
Don't worry about it.
I'm, like, the only one here.

243
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,780
I just wanna catch some sun.

244
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,650
Lay on the bed a little bit,
get my groove on.

245
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,410
Then maybe I could get
some of your sunshine.

246
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,750
Okay.

247
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,980
How long do you want it?

248
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,420
Just leave it on low.
I'm gonna relax for a bit.

249
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,250
I'll get out when I'm done.

250
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,080
I'll be ready.

251
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,370
Totally. Like, yeah, I saw it.

252
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,470
He is so hot.

253
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah, totally. Most people go nude.

254
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,910
Totally.

255
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,690
Yeah. Totally.

256
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,500
No. Totally.

257
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,880
Yeah.

258
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,060
Totally.

259
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,630
Shut up.

260
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,470
Help! Betsy!

261
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,040
Yes way. My past.
I could be president.

262
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,310
What time is it?

263
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,320
Oh, shit. Roger!

264
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,290
Oh, shit.

265
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,730
Roger! Roger! Roger!

266
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,800
- Amen.
- Amen.

267
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,250
Peace be with you.

268
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,850
Thank you, Father.

269
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,000
Samantha?

270
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,840
Samantha?

271
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,410
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,410
I brought you homework you might
have missed when you were gone.

273
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,590
I saw how Buck was looking
at David at the funeral.

274
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,160
Heather, you know that David had
nothing to do with Roger's accident.

275
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,820
Yeah.

276
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,520
Listen...

277
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,430
...I know that things have
been difficult for us.

278
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,270
It was so much easier
when we were kids.

279
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,230
God, Sam, we were so close.
What happened to us?

280
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,380
It's funny you should say that.

281
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,210
Why?

282
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,760
Because it sounds like it came
from a TV movie, that's why.

283
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,390
Look, what happened to you was
just a little payback prank...

284
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,160
...and I had nothing to do with it.

285
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,800
The guys didn't mean
to go so far...

286
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,470
...but they were pissed off
you published that photo.

287
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,970
Just a prank?

288
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,640
They drugged us,
and who knows what they did to us...

289
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,540
...after they locked us up.
I sure as hell don't.

290
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,270
How hard was it
to crawl out the window?

291
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,170
That's not the point, Heather.

292
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,880
Look, Sam, there's more.

293
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,180
It's...

294
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,960
- This has all happened before.
- What do you mean?

295
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,260
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

296
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,940
Make sure and do
your history homework.

297
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,900
I'm sorry.

298
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,340
She brought me my homework.

299
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,550
She felt bad. She was cool about it.

300
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,440
Damn it.

301
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,650
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

302
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,040
Heather!

303
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,500
Heather!

304
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,280
Heather!

305
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,420
Heather!

306
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,730
Heather!

307
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,970
Heather!

308
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,080
Heather!

309
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,720
Heather!

310
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,300
Oh, my God!

311
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,810
Unit 14, we have a 174...

312
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,060
What's going on?

313
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,890
What happened?

314
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,830
Sam, what...? Sam, talk to me.
What's going on?

315
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,570
Ashes to ashes...

316
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,730
...and dust to dust.

317
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,920
She was in bed. How could they
be crawling out of her face?

318
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,890
I think it's really sick, though.

319
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,860
They were coming out of her face.

320
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:03,800
Now, I'm sure you've all noticed the
new security precautions on campus.

321
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,210
Every effort is being made
to keep our students safe.

322
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,830
Now, Principal Rosetti
has asked me to remind everyone...

323
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,850
Samantha, dear.

324
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,090
Is something the matter?

325
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,060
No.

326
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,210
Well, as I was saying...

327
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,110
...students who need to speak to
a counselor should tell their advisor.

328
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,310
So how was school today, honey?

329
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,390
I saw a ghost in science class.

330
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,610
Do you really think
that he did it to himself?

331
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,480
Roger Dalton was dumb...

332
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,990
...but don't you think that he would
wake up before he cooked his ass?

333
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,280
What are you saying?

334
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm asking if you really think there's
nothing more to our friends dying.

335
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,420
Heather dropped some acid and
just ripped her face off like a mask?

336
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,330
Of course not.

337
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,960
She didn't even drink,
let alone do drugs.

338
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,540
There's something wrong
in our little town, and it has a name.

339
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,440
- Owens.
- David?

340
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,500
Both of them.
They were there both times.

341
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,180
Jesus, Buck.

342
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,810
Murder?

343
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,180
So, what are we gonna do?

344
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,730
Your dad still have
those emergency gas cans?

345
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,390
Get them.

346
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,130
And meet me behind the park
at midnight.

347
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,800
I don't know about this, Buck.

348
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,270
Come on. Scaring the girls
is one thing, but...

349
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,540
Right.

350
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,680
Okay.

351
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,550
I'll be there in 15.

352
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,290
Holy shit, this guy's dick
is smoking. Hey, McKenna...

353
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,500
...better check your beer bottle tonight.

354
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,830
Did you ever hear the story about
a guy who was drinking a beer...

355
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,470
...and found a finger in the bottle?
Look at this.

356
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,160
Someone cut his ring finger off.

357
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,840
- Wild.
- Will you stop with that crap?

358
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,930
That finger is probably
some coyote's lunch.

359
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,380
Yeah, we got EMTs on the scene.

360
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,280
Worthington High School classes
have been cancelled today.

361
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,720
Another student from that school
was found dead.

362
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,450
Although drunk and driving...

363
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,790
...early reports suggest electrocution
as the cause of death.

364
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,120
Tom Higgins,
a varsity football player...

365
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,070
There's something else
going on here.

366
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,210
Heather left this in my
American history book the other night.

367
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,350
I think someone sent this
to Heather as a warning.

368
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,480
This is the same thing
that happened to you.

369
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,620
Only I'm still alive.

370
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,380
Here.

371
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,320
Read the other one.

372
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,570
"Professor at Alpine University kills
students using urban legends as m.o."

373
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,940
Wait, you think there's
a copycat killer...

374
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,570
...that's killing our friends.

375
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,900
No, I just think that Heather
was trying to tell me something.

376
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,240
I need your help to figure it out.

377
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,840
Well, it's about time you asked.

378
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,350
Mary Banner lived here in Utah.
She went to Worthington High.

379
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,960
It says the other two girls
returned home unharmed.

380
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,920
They should still be alive.
See if you can find it online.

381
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,430
Are you smoking crack? This is
dial-up. Let's use the school database.

382
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,420
- School's closed today.
- I have keys to the newspaper office.

383
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,130
Okay.

384
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,410
Let's just get down there
and finish this.

385
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,960
Wait, wait, go back.

386
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,130
- There.
- Wow, deja vu.

387
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,640
"The two girls,
seniors at Worthington High...

388
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,810
...refused to press charges
against unknown assailants."

389
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,750
Why no names?

390
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:59,820
Got them. Gina Lotnick, 17, Mary
Banner, 18, and Grace Taylor, 17.

391
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,950
Where are they now?

392
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,490
Oh, that's from '82.

393
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,860
"Local resident Gina Lotnick
died this morning...

394
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,000
...of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

395
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,870
Miss Lotnick was one of the victims in
the homecoming kidnapping in 1969...

396
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,740
...of which there are no suspects.

397
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,180
Mary Banner, another victim, was
never found and presumed dead."

398
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,540
- Who was the other girl?
- Grace Taylor.

399
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,010
"The only remaining survivor
of that fateful night is Grace Taylor."

400
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,680
Hey, got it. It's not that far
from our house.
