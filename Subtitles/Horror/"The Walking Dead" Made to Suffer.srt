- By who?

00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:12,508
By this guy who calls
himself the Governor.

00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:15,490
Daddy still loves you.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,760
I'll go after him.

8

This place sounds
pretty secure.

9

10
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:23,307

- They were just behind me.

22
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:37,475
- Is there a clearing ahead? A place
to regroup? - I didn't get very far.

23
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,511
There might be
a building up ahead.

24
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:41,746
I thought I saw a tower
past the trees.

25

37
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,612
Don't.

38
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:54,414
She's slowing you down,
she's slowing us down.

39
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,616
And once we're in there,

40
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,085
She's right.
You gotta leave me.

41

No. Please.

42
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:03,823

- We can't do this.
- You wanna drag her around?

45
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:11,330
She's suffering.
And when she finally turns--

47

00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,765
Okay.

184
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,136
Give me the gun!

185
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,504
Get up!

186
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:55,755
<i>( Merle speaking, indistinct )</i>

187
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,324
Glad we could catch up.

188
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,062
Just keep looking at me.

189
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,098
I love you.

190
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,103
Man: <i>On your feet, move.
Let's go, come on.</i>

191
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,604
Shit.

192
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,780
<i>( explosion ) ( all shouting )</i>

193
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:33,423
( coughing )

194
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,396
Shots came from up there.

195
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:41,232
- I'm gonna check it out.
- No, I'll handle it.

196
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,233
Sometimes biters get in
through the side fence.

197
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,734
There's no need
for anyone to panic.

198
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,770
Woman:
Someone help!

199
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,772
What happened?

200
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,942
Guys came through with guns.

201
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,145
- Governor: <i>How many?</i>
<i>- I-- I don't know.</i>

202
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,581
- Well, think. - Six or seven guys.
I've never seen them before.

203
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,816
Girl: <i>Are we under attack?
What should we do? ( crowd clamoring )</i>

204
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,317
Hey, hey, hey.

205
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:04,987
Everyone, please just go
home, lock your doors, huh?

206
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,089
We need to keep
everyone safe, okay?

207
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,024
So just get inside,
keep your lights off.

208
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,026
Come on.

209
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:12,895
( crowd murmuring )

210
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,529
We're under attack.

211
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,398
You fan out and you
find these people.

212
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,400
Don't take any chances,
try and take prisoners.

213
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,869
You shoot to kill, huh?
Come on.

214
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,112
Rick:
Inside, quick!

215
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:43,056
- Daryl: Ain't no way out back here.
- Rick, how did you find us?

216
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,158
- How bad are you hurt?
- I'll be all right.

217
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,659
Where's that woman?

218
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,195
She was right behind us.

219
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:53,933
Daryl: Maybe she was spotted.
Want me to go look for her?

220
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,335
No. We gotta get them
out of here.

221
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,204
She's on her own.

222
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:01,874
Daryl, this was Merle.

223
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,843
<i>It was.</i>
<i>He did this.</i>

224
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:08,179
- Rick: <i>You saw him?</i>
<i>- Face to face.</i>

225
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,415
Threw a walker at me.
He was gonna execute us.

226
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,952
S-So my brother's
this governor?

227
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,887
No, it's somebody else.

228
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,621
Your brother's his
lieutenant or something.

229
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,189
Does he know
I'm still with you?

230
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,225
He does now.
Rick, I'm sorry.

231
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,759
We told him wherthe prison was.

232
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,196
- We couldn't hold out.
- Don't. No need to apologize.

233
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:30,133
Maggie: They're gonna
be looking for us.

234
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:32,635
We have to get back.
Can you walk?

235
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:34,471
We got a car a few miles out.

236
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:36,172
- I'm good.
- All right.

237
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:38,407
Daryl: Hey, if Merle's
around, I need to see him.

238
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,042
Not now.
We're in hostile territory.

239
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,311
- He's my brother. I ain't--
- Look at what he did!

240
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,480
Look, we gotta-- we gotta
get out of here now.

241
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,448
Maybe I can talk to him.
Maybe I can work something out.

242
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,951
No, no, no.
You're not thinking straight.

243
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,019
Look, no matter what
they say, they're hurt.

244
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,988
Glenn can barely walk.

245
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,856
How are we gonna make it out

246
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,091
if we get overrun by walkers

247
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:57,592
and this governor
catches up to us?

248
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,861
I need you.

249
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:02,797
Are you with me?

250
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:04,565
Yeah.

251
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,068
<i>( door opens )</i>

252
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:09,603
- Any sign of them?
- Signs of what?

253
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,438
What exactly
is happening out there?

254
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,707
Some assholes want
what we have.

255
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,176
- Then what are we doing waiting
around here? - Damn straight.

256
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,744
Let's take these
sons of bitches out.

257
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:19,613
How do we know that the
perimeter was breached?

258
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:21,215
Did anyone actually see them?

259
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,116
- They killed Warren.
- Killed?

260
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:27,020
<i>Got up close, stuck a stake</i>
<i>through his neck.</i>

261
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,587
We need patrols now.

262
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,290
Can't take chances
with these terrorists.

263
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,992
You check on our people,
make sure they're safe.

264
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,527
You want me to do house calls,

265
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:35,962
make sure everyone's tucked in?

266
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:38,731
These guys could be holed up
in one of our residences.

267
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,865
They could be holding
someone captive or worse.

268
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,167
Can't anyone else handle that?

269
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,269
I've got a hell of a lot
of experience and--

270
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,770
Thank you.

271
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,605
The rest of you split up.

272
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:49,408
Merle will lead the search.

273
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,478
Don't you think Haley should
handle the door-to-doors?

274
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,446
I need someone with some authority
to provide reassurance.

275
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,114
I mean, she's just a kid.

276
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,516
These people have already
killed one man, beaten another.

277
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:02,386
- I'm good with a gun--
- Just do as I ask.

278
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,589
Sure.

279
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:00,140
On three.
Stay tight.

280
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:01,475
One, two, three.

281
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,419
Let's go!

282
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,000
There they are!

283
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:16,389
<i>( gunfire )</i>

284
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,845
Behind you!

285
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,424
Go! Get cover!

286
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,492
Get there.

287
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:59,296
Go, go, go!

288
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:02,299
- You all right?
- I saw them.

289
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,036
- How many?
- Oscar: <i>I didn't see.</i>

290
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,704
Don't matter.
There's gonna be more of them.

291
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:11,274
We need to move.
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

292
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:15,678
One of them, at least.
Black guy, young.

293
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,614
Looked like he was wearing
a prison jumpsuit.

294
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,615
Escaped convicts.

295
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:22,617
- Any grenades left?
- Uh-huh.

296
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:25,320
Get 'em ready.
We gotta gun into the wall.

297
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:33,027
We gotta get off the street.

298
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,762
We're not soldiers,
we're survivors.

299
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,263
We'll wait them out.

300
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:38,566
- Once the smoke clears--
- Nah, they could be anywhere.

301
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,735
- You get off the street.
- Where are you going?

302
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,637
- Off the street. Come on, move!
- Oh shit.

303
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:45,839
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.

304
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,442
- No, we gotta stay together.
- Too hairy. I'll be right behind you.

305
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:53,614
Ready?

306
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,721
- Move!
- Let's get out of here!

307
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,990
- Come on!
- Keep going!

308
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,491
Oscar:
This way!

309
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:35,853
- Ah!
- Glenn: No!

310
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,431
Maggie:
<i>Rick! Rick!</i>

311
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,701
<i>( Glenn yells ) Maggie!</i>

312
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,003
Rick!
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

313
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:07,448
Daryl!

314
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:09,051
Go!

315
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:17,928
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

316
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:29,105
Hershel:
Finally got Judith to sleep.

317
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,040
How are we with formula?

318
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:35,478
We have enough
to last us another month.

319
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:40,584
I'll tKe Carol for some more
at the end of the week.

320
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:43,019
Your dad and the others
will be back by then.

321
00:24:44,554 --> 00:24:47,756
We don't know that.

322
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:51,493
Right now, Judith is
the only family I got.

323
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:55,664
<i>( distant woman screaming )</i>
<i>What was that?</i>

324
00:24:55,665 --> 00:24:57,666
- That was from inside.
- Was that Carol?

325
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,202
She's out keeping watch in
the guard tower with Axel.

326
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:01,769
What if they came back in
for something?

327
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,238
What if they're in trouble?

328
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,772
<i>Let's check the tower,</i>
<i>see if she's there.</i>

329
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,073
How could anyone else get in?

330
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:07,742
The tombs are filled
with walkers

331
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,277
that wandered in from outside.
<i>( woman screaming )</i>

332
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,178
Someone else could have
done the same thing.

333
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,249
- I'm going.
- I can't let you go down there.

334
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:17,884
My father would go.

00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,449
( rasping )

357
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:54,253
No!

358
00:28:58,224 --> 00:28:59,759
Don't hurt her.

359
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,799
Look. Hey.

360
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:17,576
It's me you want.

361
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:26,350
There's no need
for her to suffer.

362
00:29:26,351 --> 00:29:28,486
She doesn't have needs.

363
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:30,488
Please.

364
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:36,226
Don't hurt my little girl.

365
00:29:40,097 --> 00:29:42,264
Please don't.

366
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:48,972
No!

367
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,479
( roaring )

368
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,957
Ah!

369
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,428
( yells )

370
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,400
( yells )

371
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,070
( yelling )

372
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,508
( coughing )

373
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:33,780
Come here. Come here. Come here.

374
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,449
Come here.
Come, come, come.

375
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,153
No!

376
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:42,321
Ow! Oh!

377
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:45,324
( panting, coughing )

378
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,609
Ah!

379
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,847
( screaming )

380
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:16,520
No!

381
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:25,762
What have you done?

382
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,139
Oh, good God.
Oh, my God.

383
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,907
( crying ) Here, here.

384
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:37,763
( sobbing )

385
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,712
( muttering )

386
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,648
Man:
Oh, God! Donna?

387
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,149
Is she dead?

388
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,284
Is she dead?
Baby?

389
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:17,324
( crying )

390
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,693
I'll take care of it.
<i>( gun cocks )</i>

391
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,529
Whoa!

392
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,063
Whoa, kid.
Wait a minute.

393
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:25,566
- She doesn't have that long.
- Who the hell are you?

394
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,634
How did you get in here?
Who are you with?

395
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,468
Look, we can help you.

396
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:30,970
First things first.

397
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:33,640
No, we take care of our own.

398
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,612
- No, Tyreese!
- I gotta do it.

399
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,748
Look, just take Ben
and lean against the wall.

400
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:43,749
It'll be quick.

401
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,324
It's okay.
It's okay.

402
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,570
<i>( door closes )</i>

403
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:08,105
Hey, what are you doing?
<i>( keys jingle )</i>

404
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:14,144
- Kid, did you just lock us in here?
- Open the door.

405
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:16,412
This room is secure.
You'll be safe.

406
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:17,881
You have food and water.

407
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:24,955
- Open this door.
- I can't.

408
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:26,890
Come on, man.
We're not animals.

409
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:28,959
Don't do this.

410
00:34:30,928 --> 00:34:32,194
Hey!
<i>( bangs )</i>

411
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,696
You can't just
leave us in here!

412
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,565
Open this door! Open it! Now!
<i>( bangs )</i>

413
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,134
Sasha!

414
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:43,038
Back away from their door
and let the man go.

415
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:51,913
Look around you.

416
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:55,316
This is the best
we've had it in weeks.

417
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:58,586
<i>His house.</i>

418
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:04,191
We got other things to do.

419
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:09,663
We don't want any trouble.

420
00:35:16,537 --> 00:35:20,340
- Shouldn't we help them?
- I did.

421
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,411
It doesn't look good.

422
00:35:26,412 --> 00:35:29,615
The glass has done
a lot of damage.

423
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:31,550
I need to get out of here.

424
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:34,052
- Not yet.
- Get out of my way!

425
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:36,522
Can you give us a minute?

426
00:35:46,398 --> 00:35:48,432
What the hell was that?

427
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:51,001
Why was she here?

428
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:53,671
Why were you fighting her?

429
00:35:53,672 --> 00:35:55,473
She came back to kill me.

430
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,808
- Why?
- You tell me.

431
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,679
You knew her.

432
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:08,918
The fish tanks, the heads?

433
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:12,556
I made myself look at them.

434
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,891
Prepared me for
the horrors outside.

435
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,263
And Penny?

436
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:33,241
Oh, my God.

437
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:35,810
I just heard.
Are you all right?

438
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:38,112
Your eye, is it--
<i>( door opens )</i>

439
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,251
What happened to you?

440
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:51,991
I was attacked.

441
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:53,627
Merle: <i>They made
it over the wall.</i>

442
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,330
I'll go after them
in the morning.

443
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:08,209
Here, here.

444
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,810
Get down.

445
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:14,715
( coughs, grunts )

446
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,121
Come on, Daryl.

447
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:22,256
( rustling )

448
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:27,961
Rick: Where the hell were you?
( gun cocks )

449
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:31,131
Put your hands up.

450
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,533
Turn around.
Turn around.

451
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:53,085
- Get what you came for?
- Where are the rest of your people?

452
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:56,088
- They got Oscar.
- Daryl is missing. You didn't see him?

453
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:00,925
- If anything happens to him--
- I brought you here to save them.

454
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:05,296
Thanks for the help.

455
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:09,066
You'll need help to get
them back to the prison

456
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,536
or to go back
in there for Daryl.

457
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:15,872
Either way, you need me.

458
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,881
( chatter )

459
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:48,069
( chatter stops )

460
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:57,279
What can I say?

461
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:03,617
Hasn't been a night like this

462
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,952
since the walls were completed.

463
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,758
And I thought
we were past it--

464
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:20,433
past the days when we all sat,

465
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:24,437
huddled, scared
in front of the TV

466
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:27,340
during the early days
of the outbreak.

467
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:33,612
The fear we all felt then,

468
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:36,147
<i>we felt it again tonight.</i>

469
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:42,987
I failed you.

470
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:48,826
I promised to keep you safe.

471
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,631
Hell, look at me.

472
00:39:58,537 --> 00:40:01,071
You know, I--

473
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:04,907
I should tell you
that we'll be okay,

474
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:07,810
that we're safe,

475
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,614
that tomorrow we'll bury
our dead and endure,

476
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:13,383
but I-- I won't,

477
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:15,285
because I can't.

478
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,322
Because I'm afraid.

479
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:22,324
That's right.

480
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:29,131
I'm afraid of terrorists
who want what we have.

481
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,669
Want to destroy us!

482
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,671
And worse...

483
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:40,808
because one
of those terrorists...

484
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:44,979
is one of our own.

485
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,515
( crowd murmuring )

486
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:51,685
Merle...
<i>( crowd muttering )</i>

487
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:55,756
<i>the man I counted on,</i>

488
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:59,193
<i>the man I trusted.</i>

489
00:40:59,194 --> 00:41:02,862
He led 'em here.
( crowd gasps )

490
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:05,064
And he let 'em in.

491
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,371
It was you.

492
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:13,873
You lied,

493
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:16,275
betrayed us all.

494
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:31,190
This is one of the terrorists.

495
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,162
Merle's own brother.

496
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,343
What should we do
with them, huh?

497
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,947
- Crowd: Kill them!
- What?

498
00:41:56,948 --> 00:42:00,116
- What you want?
- Crowd: Kill them!

499
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,259
( crowd chanting ) Kill them!

500
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,705
You wanted your brother.

501
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:27,242
Now you got him.
