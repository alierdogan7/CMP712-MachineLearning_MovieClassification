[thunderclap]
[man groans]

3
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,009
[groaning]
Easy.

4
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,497
Okay. Come on.

5
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,716
Cool off.
Take some breaths here.

6
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:10,568
[beeping]

7
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,353
[Man gasps]

8
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:15,173
It's your responsibility now.

9
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,725
Just you.

10
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:18,560
[beeping stops]
[Woman]
The signal stopped.

11
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:29,170
[thunderclap]

12
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,456
Hey, listen.

13
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:33,909
We got about a half hour
till daylight.
We can make it.

14
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,994
Come on. Let's go.
Get up.

15
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,553
You've got to focus.

16
00:01:45,554 --> 00:01:47,389
You don't stand a chance
against it,

17
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,873
not out here.

18
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,542
Not out here,
but maybe in there.

19
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:54,763
Come on. Let's go.

20
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:57,815
Come on.
Attaboy.
[groaning]

21
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,267
Got him?
Yeah.

22
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,102
You got him?

23
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,572
¶ [hip-hop]

24
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:31,583
Now he says we only gotta
take the baggies once.

25
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,151
Fuckin'- Aw, shit.

26
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:37,154
Shit! Stupid hippies.

27
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:41,092
Next time,
I use Puerto Ricans.

28
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,466
[snorting]

29
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:11,756
[popping sound]

30
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:13,624
Swish.

31
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,686

32
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:28,356

35
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:36,531
[Man]
Come on. Come on!

36
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,352
[whispers]
Shit.

37
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,540
Put him over there.
Come on.

38
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,796
[groaning continues]

39
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,682
You all right?
Yeah.

40
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,816
[mouthing words]

41
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,288
[Man]
She's not getting it, Doug.

42
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,857
Not tonight, she's not.

43
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,734
[beeping]

44
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,679
[Woman]
That's it. That's it!

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,482
[beeping intensifies]
Getting closer.

46
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,317
Burn it.

47
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,020
[grunts]
Burn it!

48
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,858
Nothing must remain.

49
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,480
Getting closer!
[beeping intensifies]

50
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,680
[thunderclap continues]

51
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:32,063
[beeping continues]

52
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:47,645
We're gonna make it. Right?

53
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:50,331
Maybe you could shoot me.

54
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,551
She might leave you alone.
Wouldn't do any good.

55
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,204
She's got it, too.

56
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,390
[guttural breathing]

57
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,558
How far?

58
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,943
10 yards.

59
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,480
8 yards.

60
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,100
[guttural breathing continues]

61
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,252
5 yards.

62
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,739
Showtime, people.

63
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,956
[rifle cocks]

64
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,344
[device beeping rapidly]
I can feel her.

65
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,283
[screaming]

66
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,305
[yelling]

67
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,442
[whimpering]

68
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,732
Fire! Fire!

69
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,320
[yelling continues]

70
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,979
[Man]
No! No! No!

71
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,480
[screaming]

72
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,004
[thud]

73
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,840
[Woman screaming]
[thudding]

74
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,531
[roars]
[Man screaming]

75
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,610
[beeping]

76
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,690
[phone ringing]

77
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,064
You Carnby?

78
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,066
Edward Carnby?

79
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,901
Maybe.

80
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,070
How'd you get the number?

81
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,740
Shep gave it to me.

82
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,375
He says you
can help me out.

83
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,127
You know stuff
about the occult-
ghosts and shit.

84
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,363
That's delicate stuff,

85
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:37,465
and it don't come cheap.

86
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,016
Yeah.

87
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:42,620
Yeah, I know.

88
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,728
He said you'd get us
into the coroner's office.

89
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,797
So I can see the bodies.
He tell you this?

90
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,833
Shep says a lot of things,

91
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,236
and most of them
don't make any sense.

92
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,505
But he did mention something
to me about a dagger.

93
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:06,593
A little black dagger
about this big.

94
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,096
I might be
interested in that.

95
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,631
[groaning]

96
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,903
What's wrong
with you, man?

97
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,040
[groans]

98
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,042
You were there when
those three people
got butchered,

99
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,794
and now you wanna see
their dead bodies?

100
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,713
The dagger, Xavier.
You want my help?
I need to see it.

101
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:40,060
Carnby, come on.

102
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,682
Make sure nobody's coming.

103
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:57,444
Xavier, come on.
What, are you scared?

104
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,337
How'd you know
how to get in here?

105
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,075
It's not about how.

106
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:29,694
It's about how much.

107
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,590
Keep your mouth shut.

108
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,381
It looks like
it exploded.

109
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,105
She's got it, too.

110
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,925
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

111
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,031
Aah, fuck.

112
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,233
Geez, she touched the dagger.

113
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,119
These lines-

114
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,387
they work their way
through your body.

115
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,389
Then they try
to control you.

116
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,994
It reacts to light.
Yeah.

117
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,846
It re- It-
[coughing]

118
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,967
[coughing continues]

119
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,972
Hey.

120
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,091
What's wrong with you?

121
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,510
I can't control it anymore!

122
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,411
[groaning]

123
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,849
How long have you
had this for?

124
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,519
Since I touched
the dagger.

125
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,754
It started in my hand,
and it's-

126
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,257
it's all through my body.

127
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:14,992
[panting]

128
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,211
The dagger's real.

129
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,982
Take it.

130
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:24,202
Just be careful.

131
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,654
Don't cut yourself.

132
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:38,382
Yeah.

133
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,518
I thought that
was cool at first, too.

134
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,838
It's the lines.

135
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,773
A witch's mark.

136
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,277
When you first
touch the dagger,

137
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,180
there's a burning feeling.

138
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:55,215
It's light at first,

139
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,619
but it builds.

140
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,020
She gets-

141
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,790
I've had these dreams

142
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,960
in my head,

143
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,713
and I can hear
her voice all the time.

144
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,730
If you don't do
what she says,

145
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,302
she comes
and does it for you,

146
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,754
like she did with them.

147
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:18,722
Who?

148
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,760
The witch.

149
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,595
The witch that dagger
belongs to.

150
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,981
[thunderclap]

151
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,238
You said something
about a map

152
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,957
that one of them
carved into himself.

153
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,396
That one.

154
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,723
[thunderclap continues]

155
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,178
"K, E," and some lines.

156
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,382
We have to find the right map
so we'll know the location.

157
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:03,100
She's coming.

158
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,519
[guttural breathing]

159
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,393
Is there another way
to get out of here?

160
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,751
[thunder rumbling]

161
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,124
[thunderclap]

162
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:22,729
You know how much power
that dagger has?

163
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,865
How it works?

164
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,300
So it was hidden in here?

165
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,406
[guttural breathing]

166
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,076
[beeping]

167
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,344
I can feel her.

168
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:01,669
Hey, are you sure
that they didn't take

169
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,656
what was placed in the dagger
and place it somewhere else?

170
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,375
Do you want power?

171
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:11,011
More power than
you've ever imagined?

172
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:15,398
[grunts]

173
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,319
What price
you want to pay, Carnby?

174
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,670
What are you willing
to pay?

175
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,960
You belong to her now.

176
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:28,795
I did it!

177
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:31,331
I did what you wanted!

178
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,068
I did what you wanted!

179
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:01,979
Where is the dagger?

180
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,248
Hey! Where's the dagger?

181
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,117
It's here.
He stabbed him with it.

182
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,986
The signal's getting closer.
We have to go.
[beeping]

183
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,188
[guttural breathing continues]

184
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:13,624
[groaning]

185
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,543
We're gonna have to
take him with us.

186
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,227
It's too late.
The signal's already in range.

187
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,297
She's coming
for our friend here.

188
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,633
He's lit up
like a Christmas tree.

189
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,285
[beeping intensifies]
10 yards.

190
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,303
[Man]
It's the only chance we have.

191
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:30,841
5 yards.

192
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,377
This is the best
I can do for you, pal.

193
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,684
No change.
[beeping continues]

194
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,853
And this one?

195
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,822
His wound is too fresh.
She can't see him yet.

196
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,991
No change.
[buzzing]

197
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,944
Wait! No more signal.
[buzzing stops]

198
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,428
[groaning]

199
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,531
The knife has started
to dissolve.

200
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,283
Pack up.
We're taking him with us.

201
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:59,703
No...
[yelling]

202
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:02,005
[groaning]

203
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:09,012
If he puts us in any danger,
I'll shoot him.

204
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,923
[groaning]

205
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:22,025
I think it's starting.

206
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:26,513
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

207
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,083
[Man]
Ask him what he sees.

208
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:34,455
[groaning continues]

209
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,441
It's that piece of blade.
It's killing him.

210
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,493
He won't make it.

211
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,595
Pull over.

212
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,797
Pull over!

213
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,168
Got him?

214
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,471
[Man]
Faster!

215
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:58,012
Here. I'll do it, Dad.

216
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,897
Who are you?

217
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,982
[groaning continues]
Hold him down!

218
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,119
Damn it!

219
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,921
[yelling]

220
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,743
Where is the dagger?

221
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,728
You think you can
get it out?

222
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,750
[Man]
Okay, let's get him
from the street.

223
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,268
Come on!

224
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:27,707
Is it over?

225
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,110
It's just starting.

226
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,670
[grunting]

227
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,997
I can't get
this damn thing to work.

228
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:29,002
Dad, he's awake.

229
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,604
Ah, okay.

230
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,957
Well, keep trying.
All right. All right.

231
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,978
Keep trying.

232
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:50,708
How's he doing?

233
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,593
How do you feel?

234
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:55,462
Where am I?
With friends.

235
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,967
Now listen up, Carnby.

236
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,885
That's your name,
right?

237
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,887
Now,
you've been stabbed.

238
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:06,222
As a result,
you're gonna see things-

239
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,625
visions, dreams.

240
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,694
Now, we need to know
exactly what you see,

241
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:13,364
and in particular,
we need to know the location.

242
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,783
Now, you can either
work with us,

243
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,351
or you'll end up
a dead man.

244
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:21,071
I need a phone.
Whatever happens,

245
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,490
don't ever look into
the mirror in your dreams.

246
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,992
If you
look into the mirror,

247
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,294
the enemy will know
where we are.

248
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,362
If this happens,

249
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:32,416
Boyle here will shoot you.

250
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,651
Welcome to my house.

251
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,225
Let me go.

252
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,177
We're doing this
to save your life.

253
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,380
I promise.

254
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,395
The blade has deteriorated.

255
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,097
It was in his body too long.

256
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,800
What worries me even more
is that the reliquiaes

257
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,300
that were inside it
are missing.

258
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:27,037
He needs somebody
who knows how to deal
with that kind of wound.

259
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,989
We can't take him
to a hospital.

260
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,441
It's not a normal wound.

261
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,875
No, I'm not talking
about a hospital.

262
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,043
I'm talking about someone

263
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,478
who knows
what's involved here.

264
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:38,398
If anybody can help him,
Abner can.

265
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,869
[slams hand down]
I told you never to mention
his name again!

266
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,720
Now, let me
tell you something.

267
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,756
Carnby will be dead
and gone

268
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,659
long before I ever
invite Abner Lundberg

269
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,294
to set foot
in this house again.

270
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,613
Now, your grandfather
made his biggest mistake

271
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:53,880
in getting involved
with him.

272
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:56,617
I will not make
that same mistake.

273
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,365
What about
the vision of yours?

274
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,484
Do you really feel
them coming?

275
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,892
[groaning]

276
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,412
[Witch, whispering]
Who are you?

277
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,916
Come to me.

278
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,986
Carnby!

279
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,988
Where is he?
He's gone.

280
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,772
He got my weapon.

281
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,501
Carnby!
Carnby.

282
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,644
He's over here.

283
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,915
[groaning]

284
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,989
We're losing him.

285
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,664
Is he looking
into a mirror?

286
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,085
[Witch, whispering]
I know who you are.

287
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,987
[groaning continues]

288
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:50,623
[grunting]

289
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,648
You're not gonna shoot him.

290
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:00,767
You shoot him
when I tell you to shoot him.

291
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:04,020
What about us?
Go get the syringe.

292
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,510
[Witch]
Look at me. Look at me.

293
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,423
Right in the heart?
I have to find
the right ventricle.

294
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,892
She's looking
through his eyes!
Now!

295
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,597
[grunting]

296
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:39,905
[groaning]

297
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:52,785
[Witch]
I can see you.

298
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:54,920
I know who you are.

299
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,692
I know who you are.

300
00:27:59,693 --> 00:28:00,860
Huh?

301
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:07,017
Are we on time?

302
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,252
Looks like.

303
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,318
Go see Abner.

304
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:45,088
He'll come.

305
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,832
You looked
in the mirror.

306
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,167
I know you did.

307
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,603
You saw her.

308
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,605
You're putting us
all in danger.

309
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:29,241
No matter what you do,
the witch will come for you.

310
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:31,228
Yeah, I know.

311
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,513
[breathing heavily]

312
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:37,350
She's after the dagger.

313
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,605
What did you see?

314
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,808
I saw a woman in a lab.

315
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:51,131
A man was there
torturing her.

316
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,548
Where is the dagger?

317
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,269
He dug a grave for her
in the middle of the room.

318
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:01,491
She was supposed to be killed,
wasn't she?

319
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,660
But something went wrong.

320
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:09,899
What you're seeing
happened many years ago.

321
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,410
That man was my father.

322
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,283
Look for hints
to the location of the lab.

323
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,467
Why?

324
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,953
Because that's the only place
it will stop.

325
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,705
[groaning]

326
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,773
We're fetching someone
who can help you.

327
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,913
Why are you
doing all this?

328
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,383
She isn't after you yet.

329
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,954
Some things
are worse than death.

330
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,591
She wants my daughter.

331
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:54,293
That's why the witch
has returned.

332
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:06,472
If you're looking
for the clinic,
it's closed today.

333
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:10,160
Mr. Lundberg.
Mr. Abner Lundberg?

334
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:13,947
Uh-huh.

335
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,307
I'm Natalie Dexter.
Do you remember me?

336
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,797
Please sit.

337
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,525
I hear you never
wanted anything to do

338
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:44,194
with your father's
hocus-pocus.

339
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,062
She's back.

340
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,399
She is, huh?

341
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,267
And it's worse
than ever.

342
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,172
[sighs]
Well, it's none of my business.

343
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,107
I did what I could.

344
00:32:58,108 --> 00:33:00,109
I have
a different life now.

345
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:04,980
We need your help.

346
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,700
Do you really think
you could resist her?

347
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:10,169
She destroyed
your grandfather.

348
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,505
She will destroy
your whole family

349
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:14,257
and everyone
you've ever known.

350
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:22,282
I have the mark.
She wants me.

351
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,733
Just like my mother.

352
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,269
There's something about
the Dexters that attracts her.

353
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,620
Oh, yeah.

354
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,441
How long
have you had this?

355
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,126
For three weeks.

356
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:33,993
I went to the doctor
at first,

357
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,861
but then the dreams started.

358
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:38,662
[sighing]

359
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,698
Why didn't you
go to your father?

360
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:43,266
You just expect me
to sit around

361
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:45,435
and wait for her
to come get me?

362
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:52,009
Listen to me.

363
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,612
She was after your grandfather,
the Dexters.

364
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,314
It was revenge.

365
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,316
He was the one
that hunted her down.

366
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:02,285
Wow.

367
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,271
I felt that vibe.

368
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:06,273
No. Don't touch it.

369
00:34:06,274 --> 00:34:10,477
After all these years,
I'm immune to witchcraft crap.

370
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:16,116
It's real.

371
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:24,541
There's a piece of the heart
missing from the inside.

372
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,459
[sniffs]

373
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:31,248
Looks like this blade
has been used.

374
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:33,084
We have someone
who was injured by it.

375
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,885
And they're still alive?

376
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,220
He is.

377
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,872
Did they find
the hag's grave?

378
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:40,824
No. And he doesn't have
much time.

379
00:34:40,825 --> 00:34:43,511
We need your help.

380
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:45,612
Well,

381
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:48,349
if we'd only had this
in the day.

382
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,351
My grandfather told you things

383
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:52,353
that he never told my father.

384
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,487
You were his friend.

385
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,075
What?

386
00:34:58,076 --> 00:34:59,860
Hank Willis is on the phone.

387
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:02,713
His cow died after she took
the medicine you gave her.

388
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:04,815
He wants his money back.
He does, huh?

389
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,917
You tell him
I gave him a remedy.

390
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:09,286
I told him no food,
just water.

391
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:10,654
Tell him to go to hell.

392
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:45,022
Leave us.

393
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:55,082
You stay.

394
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,043
It's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna take care of you.

395
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:31,151
He's got slivers
in his wounds.
This dries them.

396
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:33,687
Hold it right on there
and press it.

397
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,088
Harder. Harder.

398
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,875
There you go. Okay.

399
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:40,694
This is making you visible
to the other side.

400
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:43,214
You're glowing like
a thousand-watt bulb.

401
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:45,182
What's that?

402
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,717
It's for you.

403
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,652
You got yourself
involved in something

404
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:50,587
that's way beyond
your abilities,

405
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,455
I'll tell you that much.

406
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,643
[sighs]

407
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:01,715
This dagger-

408
00:37:01,716 --> 00:37:03,717
a very amazing weapon.

409
00:37:03,718 --> 00:37:07,071
It's made of amostite.
Very valuable.

410
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:10,491
Did you want it
for the blade
or what it could do?

411
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,876
Rumors and myths.

412
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:14,544
You want to buy
eternal life

413
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:16,330
with the deaths
of others?

414
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,666
You're
fighting a witch

415
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,483
that's hundreds of years old.

416
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:21,885
She has the knowledge
and the ability

417
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:24,438
far beyond anything
we've ever known.

418
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:28,259
She can slip- insert her soul
into another body.

419
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,145
She solved the riddle
of immortality.

420
00:37:31,146 --> 00:37:34,298
You can't move
while I'm doing this.

421
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,700
This is
a radioactive solution.

422
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:40,187
Hold on.
[groaning]

423
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:43,423
Right there. Right...

424
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:46,510
Yeah. There.
[groans]

425
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,767
It makes you invisible
to the other side.

426
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:56,704
It cancels out the aura.

427
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,805
If your hair
falls out tomorrow,

428
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:00,740
then it was too strong.

429
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,945
He'll sleep.
He'll sleep now.

430
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,892
Your boyfriend is gonna
get us in a lot of trouble.

431
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:21,729
He's not my boyfriend.
Really?

432
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,164
I suggest
you keep it that way.

433
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:26,066
He's an idealist.

434
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:27,868
They're the worst.

435
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,404
I know.
I was one once myself.

436
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:49,439
[sighs]

437
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:55,679
That dagger shouldn't
cause any serious injury.

438
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,098
It kills the soul,
not the body.

439
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,400
We're on the verge of finding
the witch's lair.

440
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:02,335
Thought you might
be interested.

441
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,488
After all, you spent
a lot of time looking for it.

442
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:06,289
Whatever you find

443
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,425
will have been dead
long ago.

444
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,585
Do you still have those things
my father gave you?

445
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:20,704
They wouldn't be
of any use to you.

446
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,039
Do you still have them?

447
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,607
I burned them years ago.

448
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,511
I've made my peace
with the occult.

449
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:29,846
I don't bother it,
it doesn't bother me.

450
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,616
They're all dead,
you know.

451
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:35,519
Everyone that worked
with your father,

452
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,387
they're all dead.

453
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:40,123
They tried to do good,
and they end up doing evil.

454
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:44,812
You're gonna mess
this thing up, baby.

455
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:49,165
The great Abner Lundberg
is afraid.

456
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:52,536
You know, a lot of people
died around you back then,

457
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:54,387
and it didn't seem
to bother you.

458
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:55,989
Oh, no?

459
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,674
You were
my father's favorite.

460
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:00,411
If your father
could see you now,
he'd laugh.

461
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:03,614
You nauseated me then,
and you nauseate me now.

462
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,151
He's got two days,
maybe three.

463
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:10,086
Or, just maybe,

464
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:12,989
the hag will come
and take him tonight.

465
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,829
I'd rather not be here
if she does.

466
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:17,654
Don't touch.

467
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:23,126
You're reading
the EM frequencies?

468
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,446
We're looking
for specific patterns.

469
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:30,083
Our witch broadcast
a bunch of them.

470
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:32,169
Any readings?

471
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,387
Should there be?

472
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:44,064
Don't worry. We've got
a few surprises for her.

473
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,882

00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,289
She's already here!

476
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:57,160
Oh, shit!

478
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:03,784

00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,487
Carnby, get in here!
Come on!

483
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,557
Okay, everybody,
stay away from the wires.

484
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:30,093
Put in the UV.

485
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:34,348
Can you turn off
that alarm, please?

486
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:37,568
[alarm stops]
The lights won't
hold her forever.

487
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,552
This isn't the first time
we've had company here.

[thud]

489
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:43,123
What the hell was that?

490
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:46,910
Is she already
in the house?

491
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,328
She's on the roof.

492
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,080
Carnby, is she already
in the house?
No.

493
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:53,700
She's not here because of me.
She wants the dagger.

494
00:42:55,503 --> 00:42:57,120
But you can't
go down there now.

495
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:00,791
The two of us will go.

496
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:04,177
My kind of mission.

497
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:06,262
Good luck.

498
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:08,231
Hey. Not you.

499
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:10,066
I can feel her presence.

500
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,751
Can you?

501
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,954
We gotta get back upstairs.

[guttural breathing]

to us down here.

It's your responsibility.

518
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:49,649
Let's go
fix that generator.

00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,375
Daddy!

547
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:08,478
Don't come any closer!

548
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:22,509
Don't do it!

549
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,844
You know what to do.
No!

550
00:51:24,845 --> 00:51:26,011
[Witch cackling]

551
00:51:26,012 --> 00:51:27,563
She's waited
a long time for this.

552
00:51:29,316 --> 00:51:31,267
[screaming]

553
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:32,819
No!

554
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,821
[generator whirring]

555
00:51:34,822 --> 00:51:37,523
[crying]

556
00:51:52,506 --> 00:51:55,808
Your father
was a good man.

557
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:14,110
[sniffling]

558
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,385
She's coming back
tonight, isn't she?

559
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:29,025
She'll find us,
no matter where we are.

560
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:41,487
You're gonna be safe.

561
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:12,485
[flames whoosh]

562
00:53:37,377 --> 00:53:40,613
[Abner]
I'm sorry about what happened
to your father, Natalie.

563
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:45,100
I'm sure he had some idea
how it might play out.

564
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:47,954
Everyone
has to die in the end.

565
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:51,574
The dagger's incomplete.
You know what's missing.

566
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,626
What's driving the dagger
is weak-

567
00:53:53,627 --> 00:53:55,428
too weak to have any effect.

568
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:59,932
We need a piece
of the witch's heart
to reactivate it.

569
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:03,235
Everything you need
you'll find in the witch's lab.

570
00:54:03,236 --> 00:54:05,338
I've washed my hand of her.

571
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:06,789
My grandfather trusted you.

572
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,291
If he found anything out,

573
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:10,627
he must've
told you about it.

574
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:13,313
What do you know about
your grandfather, Natalie?

575
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:15,431
He fought against the witch,
just like you.
[chuckles]

576
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:17,766
He didn't fight
against the witch.

577
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:20,470
Your grandfather
fought for her,

578
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:22,472
and ultimately ended up
killing for her.

579
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:24,807
Why don't you cut
the crap, Lundberg?
No, no.

580
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:26,642
Please,
I'm telling the truth.

581
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:30,079
He was obsessed
with the occult.

582
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,498
You know, she needed
another vessel,

583
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:34,983
and at that same moment,

584
00:54:34,984 --> 00:54:38,171
your mother was becoming
less and less tolerant

585
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:40,590
with your grandfather's
insane ideas.

586
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:44,927
A daughter-in-law
was now becoming bothersome.

587
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,497
Your mother became the bait.
Just the bait.

588
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:51,751
Just another sacrifice
he had to make

589
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:54,737
to find out
about more secrets,

590
00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:59,108
and her body
was the witch's asking price.

591
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:00,959
You didn't know
your grandfather.

592
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,312
You don't remember him.

593
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:05,514
Your grandfather gave up
fighting for good

594
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,017
a long time ago.

595
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:11,654
All he wanted was these
secrets of eternal life
at all costs.

596
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:15,307
His reward for a piece
of your mother's heart...

597
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:21,563
was a few seductive secrets.

598
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,667
And then she demanded more.

599
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:27,686
She demanded another body.

600
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:34,259
You were 3 years old,
Natalie.

601
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,029
He told her that...

602
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,731
when you reached
the right age,

603
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:41,366
he would give you
to the witch.

604
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,803
Your grandfather sold you,

605
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,940
and now she intends

606
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:49,942
to come and collect.

607
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:26,545
This is all I have
from the good old days.

608
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,583
There has to be another box-

609
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:33,403
a green Army crate
with a red cross on it.

610
00:56:33,404 --> 00:56:35,621
This is everything.

611
00:56:56,576 --> 00:56:59,645
How much of your soul
have you already sold, Carnby?

612
00:56:59,646 --> 00:57:00,763
Hmm?

613
00:57:02,782 --> 00:57:05,568
I would never kill anyone
just to learn a few secrets.

614
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,353
Sure you would.

615
00:57:07,354 --> 00:57:09,538
And I know who I am.

616
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:11,907
But this isn't about
just me anymore.

617
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:25,755
You know, you're an idealist.

618
00:57:25,756 --> 00:57:27,707
People have to be careful

619
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,476
that they don't get damaged
from your mistakes.

620
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:11,284
[clicks tongue]
Oh.

621
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:13,753
[sighs]

622
00:58:13,754 --> 00:58:16,422
[sighs]
Such an old man.

623
00:58:16,423 --> 00:58:17,656
[rattle]

624
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:22,812
[sighs]

625
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,801
This is hopeless,
by the way.

626
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:04,653
And he left
only vague references

627
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:06,055
to where
this place might be.

628
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:30,095
What are
these letters here?

629
00:59:30,096 --> 00:59:33,081
We cut this whole thing
into quadrants.

630
00:59:33,082 --> 00:59:34,349
I've looked for this thing.

631
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:36,285
I've searched for years
and never found it.

632
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:38,921
K, E. K, E.

633
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,622
This was Kevin's quadrant.

634
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:43,375
It was in the north
of the park.

635
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:45,978
It could be in the park.
It could be near the park.

636
00:59:45,979 --> 00:59:48,313
What is that?

637
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:52,518
KE-12.

638
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:55,021
It's right here.

639
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:56,288
Wow.

640
01:00:00,844 --> 01:00:03,796
[thunderclap]

641
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:07,850
[heart beating]

642
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:11,837
[groans]

643
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,490
Where's Natalie?

644
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:21,213
[guttural breathing]

645
01:00:21,214 --> 01:00:23,282
[thunderclap]

646
01:00:25,852 --> 01:00:27,936
Oh, my God.

647
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,558
Natalie!
She's materializing
during the day!

648
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,911
Natalie!
[thunderclap continues]

649
01:00:52,912 --> 01:00:55,664
Martha, where's my gun?

650
01:00:58,317 --> 01:01:01,937
Throw the dagger!
Natalie, throw the dagger!

651
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,589
Out of my way.

652
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:10,662
[gunshots]

653
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:14,850
It's not the gun!

654
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,902
It's the bullets!
[gunshot]

655
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:22,924
Throw the dagger now!
Throw it!

656
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:45,264
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

657
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:49,601
[Witch wails]

658
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:05,351
Are you okay?

659
01:02:06,819 --> 01:02:08,820
I saw her.

660
01:02:08,821 --> 01:02:11,323
Not like in the cellar.

661
01:02:11,324 --> 01:02:13,392
I saw her face.

662
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:20,833
You feeling better?

663
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,752
I'll be fine.

664
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:25,520
You might need this.

665
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:27,823
If you find that witch's lab,
be careful.

666
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:30,159
She'll have all kinds of traps
and other measures.

667
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,660
You know, really.

668
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:33,062
If her remains
are buried there,

669
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:34,163
we'll find them.

670
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:37,225
Are you sure it's here?

671
01:03:37,226 --> 01:03:40,011
It's right here.
Okay.

672
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,901
We shouldn't be here
when it gets dark.

673
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:23,122
The lab has to be
in direct contact
with the ground.

674
01:04:23,123 --> 01:04:24,123
[thunderclap]

675
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:25,941
[guttural breathing]

676
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:27,776
Are you okay?

677
01:04:30,263 --> 01:04:33,265
[Edward]
It has to be here.

678
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,200
The others
couldn't sense it.

679
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:39,021
That's why they weren't
able to find it.

680
01:04:58,575 --> 01:05:00,825
What is this?

681
01:05:03,346 --> 01:05:05,414
We're below
the foundation.

682
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,716
[Edward]
It's here.

683
01:05:10,136 --> 01:05:12,254
There's no way in.

684
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:14,473
Maybe we can pry it open.

685
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:42,917
[grunting]

686
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:54,612
I'm going in.
Wait a minute.

687
01:05:54,613 --> 01:05:56,848
I'm the only one
who can fit.

688
01:06:13,867 --> 01:06:15,367
Well?

689
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:23,709
There's some kind
of mechanism in here.

690
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:31,349
[Edward]
Watch your step.

691
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,902
We have to get out of here
before it gets dark outside.

692
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:10,902
[straining]

693
01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:12,454
[panting]

694
01:07:12,455 --> 01:07:14,723
Let me get something.

695
01:07:25,034 --> 01:07:26,851
Where's the dagger?

696
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:39,981
Come on.
Show me the way.

697
01:07:53,513 --> 01:07:55,647
[heart beating]

698
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:03,988
[guttural breathing]

699
01:08:18,153 --> 01:08:20,689
[Witch]
Give it to me, Natalie.

700
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,323
Bring me the dagger.

701
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:32,900
[beating intensifies]

702
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:36,305
Come on.

703
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:38,674
Be a good girl.
Give me the dagger.

704
01:08:38,675 --> 01:08:39,657
No!

705
01:08:44,848 --> 01:08:45,897
[Natalie screams]

706
01:08:49,518 --> 01:08:52,120
"Don't step
on the red buttons. "

707
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:55,223
[gasps]

708
01:09:03,383 --> 01:09:05,534
Natalie.

709
01:09:05,535 --> 01:09:07,235
[gasping]

710
01:09:16,912 --> 01:09:18,347
Wait.

711
01:09:26,873 --> 01:09:29,525
I'm getting a jack
from the car.

712
01:09:33,162 --> 01:09:34,946
[grunts]

713
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:53,381
It's getting dark.
Shit!

714
01:09:56,085 --> 01:09:58,787
[guttural breathing]

715
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:02,057
She's coming!

716
01:10:12,986 --> 01:10:14,986
[Boyle]
Are you okay?

717
01:10:25,448 --> 01:10:27,632
[thunderclap]

718
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:38,577
She can't get in here,
can she?

719
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:40,612
It's her lab.

720
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,290
Let's do it.

721
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,735
[Boyle screaming]

722
01:11:28,778 --> 01:11:31,463
Buried alive.

723
01:11:31,464 --> 01:11:34,416
Witches' ultimate revenge.

724
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:42,140
It's a message
for Abner.

725
01:11:42,141 --> 01:11:43,859
It's in code.

726
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,093
He used a straightforward
encryption.

727
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,429
It's not difficult.
[chains rattle]

728
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,816
[guttural breathing]

729
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:54,653
She's trying to get in.

730
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:57,155
Wait here.

731
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:58,590
Sorry.

732
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:30,839
[guttural breathing continues]

733
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:55,630
My grandfather wanted to bury
the witch here in her lab,

734
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,565
but I don't see
a grave anywhere.

735
01:12:57,566 --> 01:12:59,567
Because there isn't one.

736
01:12:59,568 --> 01:13:01,502
It was never here.

737
01:13:12,448 --> 01:13:14,382
The foundation shift
did it.

738
01:13:14,383 --> 01:13:16,918
Roll up your sleeve.
Save that for later.

739
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:19,771
It's getting worse.
You might not have a later.

740
01:13:19,772 --> 01:13:22,440
We have to get out
of here first.

741
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:24,476
The sewers are back there.

742
01:13:24,477 --> 01:13:26,478
The lab isn't
sealed off anymore.

743
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,747
She can get in.
Where's the dagger?

744
01:13:39,475 --> 01:13:40,809
[thunderclap]

745
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,761
It's starting.

746
01:13:47,617 --> 01:13:49,200
[screams]

747
01:14:00,563 --> 01:14:01,779
[door opening]

748
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:05,917
Edward, she's coming!

749
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,825
The torch is acting up.

750
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:20,514
Natalie, let's go.

751
01:14:44,907 --> 01:14:47,158
[thunderclap]

752
01:14:54,816 --> 01:14:57,151
[grunts]
Hurry.
We have to keep moving.

753
01:15:05,378 --> 01:15:07,979
I don't think
she wanted us here.

754
01:15:28,434 --> 01:15:29,934
[grunts]

755
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:34,205
It was here.

756
01:15:41,764 --> 01:15:44,883
You need the dagger
to open the wall.

757
01:15:44,884 --> 01:15:48,169
That's why
she couldn't escape.

758
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,238
[groans]

759
01:16:15,598 --> 01:16:18,132
[groaning]

760
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:24,205
Hey, come here.
You okay?

761
01:16:24,206 --> 01:16:25,524
It's started.

762
01:16:25,525 --> 01:16:27,992
[groaning continues]

763
01:16:33,282 --> 01:16:36,050
[groaning]

764
01:16:37,353 --> 01:16:39,320
You belong to her now.

765
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,690
She has a claim on you,

766
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:44,492
and you're here to collect.

767
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:47,945
This isn't you, Edward.

768
01:16:47,946 --> 01:16:49,981
You can fight against it.

769
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:52,850
[groaning]

770
01:16:55,988 --> 01:16:57,405
[groaning]

771
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:02,326
You should know
someone always has to die.

772
01:17:03,128 --> 01:17:04,412
Well, it's not gonna be me.

773
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:06,214
[groans]

774
01:17:13,138 --> 01:17:15,790
Natalie.

775
01:17:18,661 --> 01:17:20,679
Natalie!

776
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,931
[grunts]

777
01:17:33,009 --> 01:17:36,027
[screams]

778
01:17:36,028 --> 01:17:37,996
[guttural breathing]

779
01:17:48,874 --> 01:17:51,559
[thunder rumbling]

780
01:18:26,027 --> 01:18:28,996
Without the witch,
that thing's useless.

781
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:37,121
I told her my code
was too easy to crack.

782
01:18:47,283 --> 01:18:49,184
[writing]

783
01:18:49,185 --> 01:18:50,785
[pen clatters]

784
01:18:52,154 --> 01:18:54,089
It's not
"Kill the witch. "

785
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:55,856
It's "Free the witch. "

786
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,268
"Kill Natalie. "

787
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:30,674
This is not Natalie.

788
01:19:32,044 --> 01:19:34,629
Oh, shit!

789
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:36,498
Watch her!
[cocks rifle]

790
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:38,166
Where's Natalie?
Where's the dagger?

791
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:39,467
Don't give it to her!

792
01:19:39,468 --> 01:19:41,503
Ow! Damn!
[cocks rifle]

793
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:44,873
I'll kill him first,
and then I'll take care
of your little girlfriend.

794
01:19:44,874 --> 01:19:47,475
She's still in here
somewhere.

795
01:19:47,476 --> 01:19:49,928
How long can you stay
in the body for?

796
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:53,515
One minute? Two?

797
01:19:53,516 --> 01:19:55,949
You know the heart
must be pierced.

798
01:19:57,770 --> 01:19:59,070
This is what you want.

799
01:19:59,071 --> 01:20:01,205
I can sense you're dying
to see how the ritual works.

800
01:20:09,414 --> 01:20:12,534
Forget about the girl.

801
01:20:12,535 --> 01:20:15,253
I can give you knowledge
beyond your wildest dreams.

802
01:20:15,254 --> 01:20:18,490
We can do things together
she'd never do.

803
01:20:20,843 --> 01:20:21,959
Do it!

804
01:20:27,499 --> 01:20:29,067
Do it.

805
01:20:32,371 --> 01:20:34,388
You foolish man.

806
01:20:34,389 --> 01:20:36,975
We could've had a lot of fun.

807
01:20:36,976 --> 01:20:40,544
I would've retrieved it
before it dissolved.

808
01:20:42,398 --> 01:20:43,997
[muffled gasping]

809
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:54,292
Don't stop till she's dead.
Wait.

810
01:20:54,293 --> 01:20:56,360
Wait.

811
01:20:58,664 --> 01:21:00,448
Wait.

812
01:21:03,185 --> 01:21:06,020
Wait.
[muffled gasping stops]

813
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:27,858
Natalie had to die
to destroy the witch.

814
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:31,145
Her old son of a bitch
grandfather knew that.

815
01:21:31,146 --> 01:21:34,532
He knew it.
What are you doing?

816
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:36,751
She's already dead,
isn't she?
No, no. Listen to me.

817
01:21:36,752 --> 01:21:38,837
Wait, wait. Wait.
Use the blade.

818
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:41,122
Use the dagger.

819
01:21:41,123 --> 01:21:42,874
Come on!

820
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:46,294
Use the dagger. Yeah.
[groaning]

821
01:21:46,295 --> 01:21:48,429
[grunting]
Use the dagger.

822
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,531
Come on!
Trust me. Come on.

823
01:21:50,532 --> 01:21:54,052
Please.
[grunts]

824
01:21:54,053 --> 01:21:57,639
I swear to God
it won't hurt her.

825
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,973
Use it.

826
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:01,742
It kills the soul,
not the body.

827
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,314
Trust me.

828
01:22:06,315 --> 01:22:10,602
Trust me. Trust me.

829
01:22:13,656 --> 01:22:14,822
[grunts]

830
01:22:14,823 --> 01:22:16,124
Yes.
[Natalie coughing]

831
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:19,327
Oh!

832
01:22:19,328 --> 01:22:21,929
Oh!
[coughing continues]

833
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:29,404
Don't ever do that again.

834
01:22:30,773 --> 01:22:33,641
[chuckles]
[panting]

835
01:22:33,642 --> 01:22:35,359
[coughs]

836
01:22:44,303 --> 01:22:46,637
[both laugh]

837
01:22:48,857 --> 01:22:51,826
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.

838
01:22:51,827 --> 01:22:53,444
Thank you.

839
01:22:53,445 --> 01:22:55,446
Oh, God.

840
01:22:55,447 --> 01:22:57,582
[groans]

841
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,941
[heart beating]

842
01:23:25,544 --> 01:23:29,681
[guttural breathing]
