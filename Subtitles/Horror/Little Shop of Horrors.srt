...in an early year of a decade
not too long before our own...

3
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:26,421
...the human race suddenly encountered
a deadly threat to its very existence.

4
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:32,758
And this terrifying enemy surfaced,
as such enemies often do...

5
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:38,331
...in the seemingly most innocent
and unlikely of places.

Very little, Mr. Mushnik!

31
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:33,003
...and at his press conference today,
President Kennedy fielded questions...

32

...concerning last Thursday's
total eclipse of the sun...

33

which has baffled the nation.

would attract business.

how ridiculous you sound?

160
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:44,924

in the window people don't suddenly--

weird and exotic cuttings.

there that day.

you know, walk on by...

174
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:40,315
...when suddenly and without warning,
there was this...

175
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,188
...total eclipse of the sun.

176
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:45,284
It got very dark.

177
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,326
And there was this strange humming
sound, like something from another world.

178
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:54,098
When the light came back,
this weird plant wasjust sitting there.

179
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,798
Just stuck in among the zinnias.

180
00:13:57,942 --> 00:13:59,466
''Audrey ll.''

181
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,541
I could have sworn
it hadn't been there before...

182
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,147
...but the old Chinese man
sold it to me anyways...

183
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:08,778
...for $1.95.

184
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,498
Well, that's an unusual story,
and a fascinating plant.

185
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:30,663
Oh, while l'm here,
l might as well take $50 worth of roses.

186
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,140
$50!

187
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,708
Can you break $100?

188
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,678
$100?

189
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:38,576
No.

190
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,977
Then l'll just have to take twice as many.

191
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,207
Twice as many?

192
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:43,577
Twice as many!

193
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,285
Twice as many!

194
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,324
That plant in the window,
it's simply amazing!

195
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,663
That plant in the window,
wherever did you get it?

196
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:57,132
-There it is, Marge.
-Oh, my gosh, it's peculiar.

197
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,813
Thank you very much, sir!

198
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,155
Thank you!

199
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:21,885
Thank you! Come again!

200
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,120
Come and look at the weirdo plant
some more!

201
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,164
lt's just going to get bigger
and more interesting.

202
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:32,536
Just don't stand there! Quick, quick!

203
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,969
Put the plant back.... What did you call it?

204
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,971
Audrey ll.

205
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,441
Put that Audrey ll back in the window
where passersby can see it.

206
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:43,244
l never thought this could happen!

207
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,509
l'm taking us all out to dinner tonight!

208
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,042
l'd love to, Mr. Mushnik, but l have a date.

209
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,152
With that nogoodnik?

210
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:56,023
You don't need a date with him.
You need major medical.

211
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,888
He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik,
but he makes good money.

212
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,127
Besides...

213
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:05,900
...he's the only fella l got.

214
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:08,661
Enjoy dinner. Goodnight, Seymour.

215
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,964
Goodnight, Audrey.

216
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,398
Poor girl.

217
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,342
Are we still going out?

218
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,250
You're not going anywhere!

219
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,256
You're staying right here
and taking care of that sick plant!

220
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,553
l told you it's been giving me trouble.
Audrey ll is not a healthy girl.

221
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,995
Between us, neither is Audrey l.

222
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:35,698
lf l only knew what breed it was.

223
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:38,860
Who cares what breed it is?
Look what it's done for business.

224
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:42,667
Work. Nurse this plant back to health.
l'm counting on you.

225
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,832
-l know.
-You do?

226
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:46,069
-l do.
-So fix. Good night.

227
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:28,180
Twoey, l don't know what else
l can do for you.

228
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:31,449
Are you sickly, little plant,
or are you just plain stubborn?

229
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,487
What is it you want?

230
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:36,619
What is it you need?

231
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:41,765
''l've given you sunshine
l've given you dirt

232
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,037
''You've given me nothing
But heartache and hurt

233
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:52,208
''l'm begging you sweetly

234

238
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:18,458
''Now please, grow for me

239
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:23,699
''l've given you southern exposure
To get you to thrive

240
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:27,038
''l've pinched you back hard

241
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,346
''You're barely alive

242
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:32,539
''l've tried you at levels of moisture

243
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:34,607
''From desert to mud

''l've given you grow lights

''What do you want from me?
Blood?''

246
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,716
Damn roses! Damn thorns!

247
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:57,457
''l've given you sunlight
l've given you rain

248
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:00,699

''Oh, please...

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,337
''...grow for me! ''

254
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,674
W-S-K-I-D.

255
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:15,875
Skid Row radio.

256
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:19,471
You're listening to radio station WSKID,
home of the hits.

257
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,144
Injust a few minutes we'll bring you
Wink Wilkensen's Weird World...

258
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,712
...where wonderful people
bring in their weird things.

259
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,792
But first, the weather.

260
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,296
Thank you. The weather today will be
partly cloudy with a chance of rain. Sorry.

261
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:38,266
The high temperature will be
in the low 50s tonight....

262
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,933
-Excuse me. l was told to come--
-You're next.

263
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,704
High tomorrow should be in the low 70s
with the low in the high 60s.

264
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:50,906
In the suburbs, the sun should be out
through most of the day...

265
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:54,781
...except for some cloudy patches
towards the evening.

266
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:57,243
The barometer reading should be 21.6.

267
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,788
The wind will be about...

268
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:01,720
...I'd say 12 miles per hour.

269
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,423
The sun will be rising tomorrow
at about 7:17 a.m...

270
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:10,398
...and it should be setting around 6:29 p.m.

271
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,761
The cold front is moving in
from the southwest.

272
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:15,429
It should brighten up by noon.

273
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:17,268
The weekend should be mild.

274
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:20,974
The average mean temperature
for the season....

275
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,811
You're listening to radio station WSKID.

276
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,619
And now, Wink Wilkensen's Weird World,
with your host, Wink Wilkensen.

277
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,252
Hi! lt's Weird Wink Wilkensen,
laughin' and scratchin' at ya.

278
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,557
How's everybody today?

279
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:43,191
l got a bit of a stiff neck.
Let me just fix this up.

280
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:44,598
That feels a lot better!

281
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:48,434
l got a great show for you today
with some wonderful weird stuff!

282
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:51,368
What are you doing here?

283
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:55,509
Please, put your clothes back on!
You can't do this to me!

284
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,444
What if your husband were to walk in?

285
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:59,414
l'm here, Wink. l love your show...

286
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,475
...but l've got to kill you both
with this machine gun.

287
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:05,443
You got me!

288
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,823
l feel so very weird!

289
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,186
Our first guest is a young man...

290
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:17,290
...you probably read about
in the newspapers by the name of...

291
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:20,194
...Seymour Krelborn. ls that correct?

292
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,296
Who has discovered a new breed of plant
unknown on this planet.

293
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:26,069
Let me play you down
to your seat, Seymour.

294
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:29,837
Hello, Seymour!

295
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:32,980
Hello, Wink.

296
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,677
l wish you folks at home could see this.

297
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:38,983
Seymour, where did you get
such a weird plant?

298
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:46,660
Well, you remember that total eclipse
of the sun about a week ago?

299
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:51,759
And thus we conclude our interview
with the young botanical--

300
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,700
Mind if I call you a genius?

301
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,794
Gosh, no!

302
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:58,102
The genius who has discovered
this amazing, unidentified plant.

303
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,440
I'd like to remind our listeners
that the Audrey II is on display...

304
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:04,275
...exclusively at
Mushnik's Skid Row Florists.

305
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,145
-Did l miss it?
-Mushnik's.

306
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:09,116
The address!

307
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,587
The address!

308
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:14,556
l said, mention the address!

309
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:19,860
Oh, well. lt's still good advertising.

310
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,788
Seymour's first radio broadcast.

311
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:26,597
l wanted to hear it so bad.
l tried to be on time, but--

312
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,661
Don't tell me. You got tied up.

313
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,037
No, just handcuffed, a little.

314
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:34,970
Girl. Hey, girl.

315
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:39,076
The mess you hang out with
is hazardous to your health.

316
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,907
That's for sure. But l can't leave him.

317
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:44,010
-Why not?
-He'd get angry.

318
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:48,421
lf he does this when he likes me,
imagine what he'd do if he ever got mad.

319
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:51,552
So, dump the chump.
Get a guy who'll protect you.

320
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,992
How about the little jerk with the glasses?

321
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,520
Seymour?

322
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,933
Oh, we're just friends.

323
00:24:58,135 --> 00:25:01,400
l don't even deserve a sweet, considerate...

324
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:04,398
...suddenly successful guy like Seymour.

325
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:07,275
That poor child suffers
from low self-image.

326
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:09,244
-You got a point.
-She got a problem.

327
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:14,508
''l know Seymour's the greatest

328
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,585
''But l'm dating a semi-sadist

''So l got a black eye

330
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,325
''Still that Seymour's a cutie

00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:42,335
''Well, if not, he's got inner beauty

''And l dream of a place

''A matchbox of our own

537

The sudden success around here?
The press coverage?

Let's go.

622
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:13,790
-l have a history of dental problems.
-Shut up!

623
00:46:15,562 --> 00:46:16,893
Yes, Doctor.

624
00:46:22,302 --> 00:46:25,135
l went to a terrible dentist Wednesday,
who was recommended to me...

625
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:26,968
...by somebody l saw Monday...

626
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,565
...who's the brother of a man
l usually see Sundays.

627
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:31,907
Their mother taught them
everything they know.

628
00:46:31,978 --> 00:46:35,607
She's gifted, but elderly.
People think she shouldn't be working.

629
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:39,513
l go to her because l'm just
incredibly devoted to her strength.

630
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,179
She can't really see who you are,
but she knows the sound of your voice.

631
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:48,688
lf you tell her where it is, the problem,
she eventually finds it and she does it.

632
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:52,095
l wish l had that stamina.
l can only go so long.

633
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:55,627
That's how l want to be.
l don't ever want to have to be just--

634
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:57,961
Comfy?

635
00:46:58,505 --> 00:46:59,904
Yes, Doctor.

636
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:03,008
l remember the first time
l went to a dentist.

637
00:47:03,076 --> 00:47:05,738
l thought, ''What a neat job!
lf only l were a dentist.''

638
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:07,973
The dentist l went to had the greatest car.

639
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:12,382
He had a Corvette. Everybody calls him
''Doctor'' and he's not really a doctor.

640
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,117
Oh, my God!

641
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,053
l got out of there okay,
but after it was all finished...

642
00:47:21,595 --> 00:47:24,530
...they gave me a candy bar.
l thought, ''l get a candy bar?''

643
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:28,968
You go through that and get chocolate.

644
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:34,000
You work with incredible professionals,
using incredibly wonderful equipment....

645
00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:35,741
Let's look at that mouth.

646
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:39,072
Say, ''Aaah.''

647
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,322
Yeah, great!

648
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:03,632
You are something special.

649
00:48:03,703 --> 00:48:05,102

652
00:48:20,053 --> 00:48:23,216
Don't stop, Doc! Don't stop!
Come on! More!

653
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,625
What do you want? Say, ''Please! ''

654
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:40,372

655
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:05,993

656
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:07,566

00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:08,760
Get out of here!

658
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:14,165
What's the matter?

659
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:19,035
Go on! Get out of here!

660
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:21,237

of my friends about you--

664
00:49:34,694 --> 00:49:37,060
Let me ask you something.
Does this scare you?

665
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:37,989
Yes.

666
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:41,659
Would you like if l took this and made
straight for your goddamn incisors?

667
00:49:41,735 --> 00:49:42,861
lt'd hurt, right?

668
00:49:43,103 --> 00:49:44,502
You'd scream!

669
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,138
Get your ass in there!

670
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:51,406
-Don't l know you?
-Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday.

671
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:53,669
Your mouth's a mess, kid.

672
00:49:54,047 --> 00:49:57,539
That wisdom tooth.
We'll rip that bugger right out of there.

673
00:49:57,617 --> 00:50:01,314
What do you say?
There's always time for dental hygiene.

674
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:05,057
You ever seen the results
of a neglected mouth?

675
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,348
Look, Seymour.

676
00:50:08,128 --> 00:50:10,153
This could happen to you.

677
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,092
Unless l take immediate action!

678
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,530
What's that?

679
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:15,823
The drill.

680
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,362
lt's rusty!

681
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:18,734
lt's an antique.

682
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:21,306
They don't make them like this anymore.

683
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,439
Sturdy...

684
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:24,139
...heavy...

685
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:25,435
...dull.

686
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:31,647

687
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:35,752
Thank God.
l thought you wouldn't use any.

688
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:38,950
The gas isn't for you, Seymour. lt's for me.

689
00:50:39,092 --> 00:50:41,925
You see, l want to really enjoy this.

690
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:46,356

my special gas mask!

691
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,594

increases my pleasure enormously.

692

695
00:51:39,018 --> 00:51:40,645
What the hell is that?

696
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:41,981
A gun?

697
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:45,550
The kid's got a goddamn revolver!

698
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:50,322
l'm in trouble now, huh?

699
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:54,433
Wait till l turn this gas off.

700
00:52:00,807 --> 00:52:02,570
Give me a hand, would you?

701
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:05,103
No, l guess you wouldn't, would you?

702
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,642
l could asphyx--

703
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:26,097
What'd l ever do to you?

704
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
Nothing. lt's what you did to her.

705
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:31,303
Her who?

706
00:52:33,773 --> 00:52:35,832
Oh, her.

707
00:53:36,836 --> 00:53:38,326
Chop it up.

708
00:53:38,871 --> 00:53:39,895
What?

709
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,436
Feed me!

710
00:53:41,507 --> 00:53:42,769
Okay, okay.

711
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:25,160
Audrey, what'd they say to you?

712
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:26,530
Who?

713
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:27,962
The police.

714
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,371
Oh, nothing.

715
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,037
Talk to me. Tell me what they said.

716
00:56:33,946 --> 00:56:35,971
lt's Orin. They say he's disappeared!

717
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:38,749
The police told you that?

718
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:40,979
They suspect foul play.

719
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:43,682
They do?

720
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:47,021
His receptionist, this morning,
found the place a shambles.

721
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,455
Gas masks everywhere.

722
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:51,626
Things all over the floor.

723
00:56:52,665 --> 00:56:54,064
They think....

724
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:57,632
l can't even think about what they think.

725
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:11,810
Don't cry, Audrey.

726
00:57:13,352 --> 00:57:16,378
Would it be so terrible
if something had happened to him?

727
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,949
Seymour, what a thing to say!

728
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:22,317
Well, would it?

729
00:57:23,963 --> 00:57:25,954
lt wouldn't be terrible at all.

730
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:28,398
lt'd be a miracle.

731
00:57:29,101 --> 00:57:32,935
Not to mention all the money l'd save
on Epsom salts and Ace bandages.

732
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,966
You see?

733
00:57:36,008 --> 00:57:38,499
But l'd still feel guilty.

734
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:43,377
lf he met with foul play
or some terrible accident of some kind...

735
00:57:43,616 --> 00:57:46,141
...it'd be partly my fault just because...

736
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:49,887
...secretly l wished it.

737
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:53,858
Don't you waste another minute
thinking about that creep!

738
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,987
There's a lot of guys that'd give anything
to go out with you.

739
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:01,427
Nice guys.

740
00:58:01,968 --> 00:58:04,869
l don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour.

741
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:08,465
-That's not true.
-You don't know the half of it!

742
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,600
l've led a terrible life.

743
00:58:10,776 --> 00:58:14,735
l deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, DDS.

744
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:18,607
You know where l met him?

745
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:22,443
ln The Gutter.

746
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:24,017
The Gutter?

747
00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:26,624
The Gutter. lt's a nightspot.

748
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:30,822
l worked there on my nights off
when we weren't making much money.

749
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:32,455
l'd put on...

750
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:36,068
...cheap and tasteless outfits,
not nice ones like this.

751
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:39,897
Low and nasty apparel.

752
00:58:40,306 --> 00:58:42,501
That's all behind you now.

753
00:58:42,675 --> 00:58:44,734
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

754
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:48,536
You're a very nice person.
l always knew you were.

755
00:58:50,016 --> 00:58:53,417
Underneath the bruises and the handcuffs,
you know what l saw?

756
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,412
A girl l respected.

757
00:58:56,822 --> 00:58:58,221
l still do.

758
00:59:01,394 --> 00:59:02,827
''Lift up your head

00:59:03,596 --> 00:59:05,223

Mr. Mushnik, you scared me.

l scared him?
After what l've seen, l scared him?

805

Do you think l didn't know, huh?
Oh, l knew.

806
01:03:22,955 --> 01:03:25,822
l knew you'd lay down here,
on your pathetic little cot...

807
01:03:25,991 --> 01:03:27,322
...and dream about her.

808
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:29,861
But l didn't know the lengths
to which you'd go...

809
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:32,193
...the depths to which you'd sink!

810
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:35,356
What depths? What sink?
What are you talking about?

811
01:03:35,434 --> 01:03:37,629
Little red dots all over the linoleum.

812
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:40,528
Little red spots on the concrete outside.

813
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:45,472
l'm talking blood, Krelborn.
l'm talking under my own roof.

814
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:48,073
An axe murderer!

815
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,846
''He's got your number now''

816
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:52,679
l saw everything.

817
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:55,117
''He knowsjust what you've done''

818
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,280
Everything you did to her boyfriend.

819
01:03:57,356 --> 01:03:59,916
''You've got no place to hide''

820
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:01,559
l saw you chopping him.

821
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:04,024
''You've got nowhere to run''

822
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,260
lt's true. l chopped him up,
but l didn't kill him!

823
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:09,392
''He knows your life of crime''

824
01:04:09,568 --> 01:04:11,433
Tell it to the police.

825
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:14,233
''l think it's suppertime!

You know, Krelborn, it kills me doing this.

837
01:05:07,993 --> 01:05:12,089
But considering you're almost
like a son to me, l'm thinking...

838
01:05:12,164 --> 01:05:14,394
...maybe we don't have to go to the police.

839
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:16,329
We don't?

840
01:05:17,102 --> 01:05:18,535
l'm thinking...

841
01:05:18,904 --> 01:05:23,307
...what if l kept my mouth shut and
gave you a one-way ticket out of town?

842
01:05:24,777 --> 01:05:25,937
You'd do that, sir?

843
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:31,412
You could lay low for a while,
say 30, 40 years.

844
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:34,646
Meanwhile, l would keep the plant.

845
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:36,688
The plant?

846
01:05:36,755 --> 01:05:40,748
Of course, you'd have to teach me
how to take care of it while you're away.

847
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:44,018
Give me your secret gardening tips.

848
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:48,065
But then, if you'd rather hang....

849
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:01,877
What do l have to do?

850
01:06:02,815 --> 01:06:04,305
Just feed it.

851
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:06,144
Feed it what?

852
01:06:12,624 --> 01:06:13,613
Minerals.

853
01:06:16,095 --> 01:06:18,586
Thursdays, you should give it water.

854
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:26,435
But whatever you do....

855
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:28,634
Yes?

856
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:33,804
Whatever you do....

857
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:35,311
Yeah?

858
01:06:40,486 --> 01:06:41,783
What the hell is...?

01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,564

-Just sign this release.
-Need a pen?

Aren't you thrilled?

869
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:21,955
Son, it's a cinch to get ratings.

870

-The title is Marvin's.
-The concept is mine.

-Sign!

01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:38,971
''lt's not a question of merit
lt's not demand and supply

875
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:41,606
''They say the meek are gonna get it.

876
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:47,145
''You know the meek are gonna get
what's coming to them''

877
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:14,169
Oh, my God!

878
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,548
And here he is himself,
Mr. Seymour Krelborn!

879
01:08:19,284 --> 01:08:21,411
Mr. Krelborn, there are many questions...

880
01:08:21,487 --> 01:08:24,115
...the people in our television audience
have for you.

881
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:26,657
Come and tell our viewers
at home and elsewhere...

882
01:08:26,725 --> 01:08:30,320
...about this particularly amazing
agricultural phenomenon...

883
01:08:30,395 --> 01:08:34,491
...that's made you one of the most talked
about plant scientists in the country--

884
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:38,525
Cut!

885
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,968
What happened
to the goddamned greenery?

886
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:43,607
-lt just needs to be fed.
-So feed it.

887
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,607
l can't feed it. Not now.

888
01:08:46,678 --> 01:08:48,839
Then l'll feed it. Where's the plant food?

889
01:08:48,914 --> 01:08:52,179
lt doesn't eat plant food.
And l can't feed it now.

890
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:54,178
Leave me alone.

891
01:08:54,253 --> 01:08:55,447
All of you.

892
01:08:56,054 --> 01:08:57,146
Just go away.

893
01:08:57,222 --> 01:08:59,486
Leave me alone. Get out of here.

894
01:08:59,558 --> 01:09:01,253
Go away. Leave me alone!

895
01:09:03,695 --> 01:09:04,855
Everybody go away!

896
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,056
Leave me alone!

897
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:08,130
You're hysterical.

898
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:09,794
l know. l'm sorry.

899
01:09:21,547 --> 01:09:23,572
What am l gonna do?

900
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:27,576
l never should've started, but l did.
Now, if l don't feed it, it'll die.

901
01:09:27,653 --> 01:09:29,814
l'll lose her, l'll lose everything.

902
01:09:30,923 --> 01:09:32,356
Who are you talking to?

903
01:09:33,258 --> 01:09:34,452
Nobody.

904
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:36,656
You're acting funny.

905
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,262
lt wasn't nice throwing those people out.

906
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:42,164
Those men said
Seymour Krelborn's Gardening Tips...

907
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:44,895
...is sure to be a very big TV show.

908
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:47,605
l know. l'm sorry. l feel terrible.

909
01:09:47,673 --> 01:09:48,731
Well, you shouldn't.

910
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:52,265
They're coming back tomorrow
and they'll bring you a great big check.

911
01:09:54,246 --> 01:09:56,214
l wish you were enjoying your success.

912
01:09:57,749 --> 01:09:59,683
They said they're coming back
with money?

913
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:00,911
Tomorrow.

914
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:03,646
Then we could afford to get out of here.

915
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:04,848
What do you mean?

916
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:07,653
That's it. After tomorrow
we could leave here together.

917
01:10:08,093 --> 01:10:09,219
Together?

918
01:10:10,596 --> 01:10:12,257
lf you'll have me.

919
01:10:12,331 --> 01:10:13,821
Audrey, will you have me?

920
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:15,792
What do you mean?

921
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:18,429
Marry me, Audrey.

922
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,137
Seymour, this is so sudden.

923
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,503
Will you?

924
01:10:27,846 --> 01:10:28,710
Sure.

925
01:10:29,915 --> 01:10:32,440
Then that's it!
We'll go get married right now.

926
01:10:33,518 --> 01:10:37,750
Tomorrow l'll be on TV, get the money
and then we'll live happily ever after.

927
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,190
Oh, Audrey, l'll give you a wonderful life
with no plants, l promise.

928
01:10:41,259 --> 01:10:43,921
-No plants at all.
-You're talking peculiar again.

929
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:46,396
We'll start tonight.
We'll go to City Hall, get married...

930
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:49,628
...and spend the night somewhere safe.
Some nice hotel.

931
01:10:51,737 --> 01:10:53,637
l've got to get ready!

932
01:10:53,705 --> 01:10:55,263
Hurry. Hurry.

933
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:02,407
Feed me.

934
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:05,373
Under no circumstances.

935
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:06,604
Feed me.

936
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:09,406
l will not, so stop asking.

937
01:12:09,514 --> 01:12:10,845
Feed me!

938
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:12,210
No! No more!

939
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,181
l can't take living with the guilt.

940
01:12:14,786 --> 01:12:16,253
Tough titty.

941
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:18,146
Watch your language.

942
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:20,783
Cut the crap. Bring on the meat.

943
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:26,424
l'll run to the corner, pick you up
some nice ground round.

944
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:29,998
-How about that?
-Don't do me no favors!

945
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:34,769
lt's my last offer. Yes or no?

946
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:39,636
You sure do drive a hard bargain.

947
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,270
Done. Fine. Great.

948
01:12:45,884 --> 01:12:48,478
Don't think you're getting dessert.

949
01:14:24,983 --> 01:14:27,611
-Hello.
-''Hey, little lady, hello''

950
01:14:29,187 --> 01:14:30,415
Who is this?

951
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:33,048
''You're looking cute as can be''

952
01:14:33,358 --> 01:14:34,723
ls this someone l know?

953
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:37,125
''You're looking mighty sweet''

954
01:14:38,864 --> 01:14:40,058
Seymour!

955
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:42,998
''No, it ain't Seymour. It's me!''

956
01:14:47,405 --> 01:14:49,600
Oh, my God!

957
01:15:08,994 --> 01:15:11,087
l don't believe it.

958
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,828
Believe it, baby. lt talks.

959
01:15:14,432 --> 01:15:15,922
Am l dreaming this?

960
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:18,863
No, and you ain't in Kansas, neither.

961
01:15:21,339 --> 01:15:23,170
Something is very wrong here.

962
01:15:23,642 --> 01:15:26,805
l need me some water in the worst way.

963
01:15:27,112 --> 01:15:29,137
Look at my branches.

964
01:15:29,214 --> 01:15:31,842
l'm drying up. l'm a goner, honey!

965
01:15:33,218 --> 01:15:35,709
''Come on and give me a drink''

966
01:15:36,054 --> 01:15:37,578
l don't know if l should.

967
01:15:37,656 --> 01:15:39,920
''Hey, little lady, be nice''

968
01:15:40,025 --> 01:15:41,822
Do you talk to Seymour like this?

969
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:44,623
''Sure do. l'll drink it straight''

970
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:46,355
Your leaves are dry.

971
01:15:46,431 --> 01:15:48,865
''Don't need no glass or no ice''

972
01:15:49,434 --> 01:15:50,765
l'll get the can.

973
01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:53,667
''Don't need no twist of lime''

974
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:55,196
Here we go.

975
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,531
''And now it's suppertime! ''

976
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,012
Oh, relax, doll. lt'll be easy.

977
01:16:17,295 --> 01:16:20,025
Get off of her! Get off!

978
01:16:40,418 --> 01:16:42,511
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

979
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:49,322
Yes. l'm okay.

980
01:16:49,394 --> 01:16:53,524
l'm sorry. l never meant to hurt you.
l never meant to hurt anybody.

981
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,998
lt's just that somehow it makes
things happen. Terrible things.

982
01:16:57,168 --> 01:16:59,796
l should've stopped
when l found out what it lived on.

983
01:16:59,871 --> 01:17:01,668
But it was so cute and harmless...

984
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,971
...and we started doing business
and making money and you liked me--

985
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:09,346
Do you really think
l liked you because of that?

986
01:17:11,483 --> 01:17:14,213
l liked you from the day
l came to work here.

987
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:18,050
You mean, you'd still like me
even if l wasn't famous?

988
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:22,760
l'd still love you, Seymour.

989
01:17:23,962 --> 01:17:25,088
Really?

990
01:17:25,764 --> 01:17:28,699
All l ever wanted was you...

991
01:17:30,735 --> 01:17:32,726
...and a sweet little house.

992
01:17:33,938 --> 01:17:36,771
You're the most wonderful person
that ever lived.

993
01:17:36,841 --> 01:17:40,299
We're gonna get that little house
and everything will be okay.

994
01:17:40,378 --> 01:17:43,779
''Suddenly Seymour

995
01:17:44,582 --> 01:17:47,642
''ls standing beside you

996
01:17:48,053 --> 01:17:52,149
''Suddenly Seymour

997
01:17:53,224 --> 01:17:55,556
''Showed me l can

998
01:17:55,627 --> 01:17:57,959
''Yes, you can--''

999
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:01,365
Excuse me, pardon me, beg your pardon.

1000
01:18:01,533 --> 01:18:04,001
lf you two kids would stop singing
for a moment...

1001
01:18:04,069 --> 01:18:06,594
...l've got something
l want to discuss with you.

1002
01:18:06,671 --> 01:18:08,935
Which one of you is Seymour Krelborn?

1003
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:11,470
l am.

1004
01:18:11,543 --> 01:18:12,635
lt's a pleasure.

1005
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:15,804
Has your phone been busy!
l've been trying to reach you for weeks.

1006
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,180
Patrick Martin, Licensing and Marketing,
World Botanical Enterprises.

1007
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:24,051
Son, kid, boy, are we gonna make
a fortune together!

1008
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:27,056
-He's not interested.
-He will be.

1009
01:18:28,593 --> 01:18:31,756
Me and the guys at the home office
have been following this plant of yours.

1010
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:34,958
We've come up with one incredible idea.

1011
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,363
We're very proud of it.

1012
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:39,034
Picture this.

1013
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,799
We take leaf cuttings,
develop little Audrey lls...

1014
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:47,637
...and sell them to florist shops
across the nation.

1015
01:18:48,613 --> 01:18:51,878
Pretty soon every household in America
could have one.

1016
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:54,318
Every household in America!

1017
01:18:54,919 --> 01:18:57,547
For starters, kid. Why this thing could go...

1018
01:18:58,189 --> 01:18:59,156
...worldwide!

1019
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:00,746
Worldwide?

1020
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:02,482
Think of it, boy.

1021
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,653
Audrey lls everywhere!

1022
01:19:04,929 --> 01:19:08,330
With the right advertising,
this thing could be bigger than Hula-Hoops.

1023
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:09,730
Bigger than Hula-Hoops?

1024
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:13,032
What do you say, Seymour?
Do we have a deal?

1025
01:19:15,206 --> 01:19:18,767
No! Keep your contract.
Nobody's touching that plant.

1026
01:19:18,843 --> 01:19:20,504
We're offering a lot of money.

1027
01:19:20,578 --> 01:19:22,808
Forget the money!
Keep it and get out of here!

1028
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:24,178
-Are you nuts?
-Yeah, l'm nuts.

1029
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:26,410
Get out of here! Go on! Get out of here!

1030
01:19:29,821 --> 01:19:32,381
l'll come back when you're
in a better mood.

1031
01:19:33,057 --> 01:19:34,888
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?

1032
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:36,221
l think so.

1033
01:19:36,794 --> 01:19:40,025
He'll keep eating until there's nothing left.

1034
01:19:40,098 --> 01:19:43,192
We've got to stop it, Seymour!
We've got to.

1035
01:19:44,135 --> 01:19:45,602
l've got to.

1036
01:19:45,937 --> 01:19:48,201
l have to end this once and for all.

1037
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,298
l'll bust that pod wide open.

1038
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:53,108
Wait! l'm coming with you.

1039
01:19:53,311 --> 01:19:57,213
No, it's me that got us into this.
l'm the one to get us out.

1040
01:19:58,683 --> 01:20:00,514
Wait for me, Audrey.

1041
01:20:00,985 --> 01:20:03,715
This is between me and the vegetable.

1042
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,994
''Every household in America! ''
Thousands of you, eating!

1043
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,766
That's what you had in mind
all along, isn't it?

1044
01:20:18,835 --> 01:20:20,962
No shit, Sherlock!

1045
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:25,608
We're not talking about one hungry plant.
We're talking about world conquest!

1046
01:20:25,943 --> 01:20:28,070
