00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:07,453
I'm advising a task force here
that's handling that investigation.

has anything to do with--

00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:11,457
No, but I do think...

511
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:15,461
that what my charmless colleague
told you before is probably true.

512
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:16,462
Right now the best thing
for you to do...

513
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:20,466
is try to establish
some form of legal custody.

514
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,470
- You need a lawyer, not a cop.
- So that's it? ''Get a lawyer''?

515
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:26,472
That's all the help
you have to offer me?

516
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:28,474
No, you have my word.
I will follow up on Stark.

517
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:31,477
It'll be my pleasure.
I think his whole outfit stinks.

518
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,480
But I want you to promise me
if you reach him first--

519
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,482
I would just feel better
if you give me a call...

520
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:38,484
before you even talk to this guy.

521
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:42,488

The only thing I can get on Stark
is the number for his lawyer.

- [Door Shuts]
- No, thanks.

525

on this one.

- [ Chuckling ] Yeah, right.
- What's that supposed to mean?

you're gonna follow up on...

to will what I do...

others judge me.

seen what I've seen.

the opposite of religion.

What does this
have to do with Cody?

566
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:30,716
About a year ago, they all started
acting a lot weirder than usual.

567
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:34,720
They started hunting down kids--

568
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:38,724
six-year-old kids, boys, girls.

569
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:41,727
But they all had to be born
on this certain date.

570
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,731
They'd take each kid
and put them through this test,

571
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:50,736
and if they failed,
they'd kill them.

572
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:55,741
''The slaughter of the innocents,''
they called it.

573
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:58,744
Only Cody isn't like
the other ones.

574
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:01,747
She's the one they've
been looking for all along.

575
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,751
So instead of killing her,
Eric's gonna try to change her--

576
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,754
to make her just like him.

577

that the star over Bethlehem...

610
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:18,003
was the sign that
the Son of God had been born,

611
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:20,005
Herod sent his soldiers
to kill all of the children...

before Mary and Joseph...

are our innocents born on?
