54
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,000
You have to be big garbage
to get involved and the child.

Silent, I will kill you .
- He's right

56
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,100
You have to go to school

Shut up, bitch !
Keep your head down !

I do it for him.

Judges are always on their side.

Not only maintenance
but must pay

73
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,100
school and insurance
and I have no money for rent.

74
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Thinking time.
You probably got a petticoat .

75
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
How to catch a sleep in the car?

76
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Stop it!

77
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,620
Give time . Get out .

78
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,900
Get out .

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800

Faster run fuck !

89
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,300
How do I know where it is?
Probably on the couch.

90
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,100
Take the child Christ !

91
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
What did you tell him?

92
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,700
You're very naive.

93
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,200
Well , yes.
Just get in the car .

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
Sonia ! Wait! Shit !

95
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,900
Sonia !

Sonia ! Sonia , stay !
Where are you going ?

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm behind the wheel.
- Stop!

99
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,800
Do you know her ?
- This is my boyfriend .

100
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,300
Why do we get the car ?
Stop , you bastard !

101
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Drive to the limit!

102
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,800
Where to go?
In Mendel Salvaro or tunnel ?

103
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,800
From where do you want , asshole .
- Shut up .

104
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,700
Select the route alone .

105
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,300
How can you be such a fool ?
- Me?

106
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,100
Why did you tell her about the car?
- I did not.

107
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
She herself thinks . I do not know how .

108
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,330
Yesterday , in the club , just go
and she 's waiting for me at the door.

109
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,230
Dad, there's a man.
- Then , champ .

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,520

You will more broadly.

Help! Help!

112
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,200
Sit down, I tell you!

113
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,400
The cab is occupied .
- Do not wait any free ?

114
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,300
If you want
to go the Vicente Calderon .

115
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,500
At this time there is no traffic .

116
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Damn ! Bastards !
- I do not see anything!

117
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,600
" Armageddon ."
- Shit .

118
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Behold, your mother 's

And I still have not learned .

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800

Do you lock the doors ?
- Yes, for children.

Jose, what's going on there?
- Excuse me, Sylvia.

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,100
Are you listening?

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,100
What you feed your child ?
- Sandwiches with ham.

141
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,800
I wondered how I
what do you eat ?

142
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,000
Do not.
- I'm tired of this control

143
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,600
and idiotic questions.
- What?

144
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,660
There's nothing to report on.

145
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,100
And because I 'm his father ,
with me always is great.

146
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,190
Give gas that blow your brain.
I'm swamped with work. Bye .

147
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Step on it !

148
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,700
Step on it !

149
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,100
Sergio , are you okay ?
- As the rally in San Andreas !

150
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,900
Now what? To Burgos
Zaragoza or Extremadura or south?

151
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
South. South.
- In the south , why?

152
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,200
Always run to the south. In Mexico .

153
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,700
This is in the movies.
- A Portugal ?

154
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
To France.
- Why France?

155
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,300
Will live in Disneyland
and he is in Paris.

156
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I will not live there.
We go on a trip

157
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,900
and then we'll see. Right?
- Can you see me in Disneyland ?

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Fuck you.
- The partners do not talk like that.

159
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,300
You take your child to work
now tells us where to run?

160
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,100
Can not fulfill whims.
Child loves more than one

161
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,400
who walks on his mind . Right?
- Excuse me .

162
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,700
If we are to France
to call a woman

163
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,090
that will not be home for dinner?
- Give me the phone.

164
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,500
It would be furious . Would be furious .

165
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,860
Put your hands where I told you .
Keep them on the trolley .

166
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,500
No raises and knows
that can not stand not meet .

167
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,000
May be turned off .
- Really? His conscience is off.

168
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,200
Do you know how much alimony he owes me?
For three months.

169
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Three months , neither the
for his son !

170
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,800
The child is an old uniform,
would break his back.

171
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,100
Consider joint custody .

172
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,800
I thought about it ,
how to go to jail

173
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,000
because they do not pay.
And you will fight sedatives

174
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,700
to not get stuck.
- But I'm fine .

Say what?
- I do not know .

St. Jude Miracle Worker .
Patron of hopeless cases.

191
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
The work was a piece of cake .
Many gold, less security,

192
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,100
I had to go ,
without drawing attention.

193

203
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Then shut up .

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
I left only one
because he is my father.

240
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,800
We need a profile picture

I told him that the idea is idiotic ,

Complete failure.

And at work, at home ,
and in bed.

323
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,800
A bed is a tigress .
- What's the problem ?

324
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Is not it beautiful?
- As the roller is

325
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Comes from the court and said :
" Tony, what's for dinner? "

326
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,200
And I did not cooked
because she did not understand the stove.

327
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Amount you and all buttons are lit.

328
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,300
Put pot, stove hot
and pot is not .

329

Can you tell?
Then go to bed.

Grabs me by the throat like a beast ,
until I can not breathe .

331
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,600

Sergio !

- In school you learn it ?

335
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,300
No, I read it
in " Cosmopolitan " Mom .

336
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,570
Listen to me , this is a lie .

337
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,100
Just speculation with numbers .
- I'm only 26.

338
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,800
And happened to me once.
- Go ahead.

339
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
It was a great woman .

340
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,500
Breasts, thighs. Everything had.
Your breath away .

341
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,500
And speaking in porn .
Such words ...

342
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,960
I just can not work.
I shook with fear.

343
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,900
Finished until her covered with a blanket .
- What if you dump me ?

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,400
And find someone better ?
- They are a curse .

345
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,100
As demons.
They messed with indifference.

346
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,100
They bind , they corrupt ...
Jump ...

347
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,100
It's to get you back
cerebellum ,

348
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,000
somewhere out there ...
- Finally kill this.

349
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,000
And grab ,
better cut his finger .

350
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,900
Go fuck yourself .
Long had to drop everything .

351
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,300
I'm with you guys . If I'm not
robbed a bank is because I do not dare .

352
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
Thank you.
- One more thing.

353
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,600
No need more to keep me
at gunpoint . Tony. Jose.

354
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,900
Consider me a member of the band.
- And why is that ? Rate you want?

355
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,500
No. Just ...
- Why should we believe you ?

356
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,700
Dad , the police chasing us .

357
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,900
No, wait . I'll do it .
Cuff is , guys.

358
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Jose.
- Do not pull , do not pull .

359
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,450
Then there will be stuck.
Sergio tightened the belt.

360
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,360
Come on, guys. Tighten up.
Hold on .

361
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,100
Carefully.
- Wood !

362
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Hold on .
- No.

363
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,100
All you have goals?
- Again !

364
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
Are you okay?
- I want more.

365
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,200
Sergio .
- Again !

366
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,800
<i> few hours after the announcement
the opening of the Berlin border , </ i>

Get out of here .
- Booze , booze .

371
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,970
How many times have I told you not to touch
drawer. You do not care .

372
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,100
Booze , booze , booze .

373
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,900
Booze , booze .
You'll see a booze .

374
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,700
Give the bottle.
And left the bar.

375
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,700
Quad jacks .
- There is noise in the image .

376
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,250
Put tape .

You will become more young and beautiful .

382
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,250
Dark color. Mahogany.

383
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,800
It rejuvenates . blonde
is no longer in vogue. Tired is

384
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,120
I love blonde .
- Caprice ? I'll throw a fit you ?

385

Do you have any soup?

390

Have.

391
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,700
Three portions.
- Where is your bathroom?

392
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,830
Right and left.
- Thank you.

393
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,000
<i> Goodnight . </ i>

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,000

Thank you.
- Sergio .

396
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,100
Jose. Jose Jose.
- What?

397
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
He died right ?

398
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Jose Moreno ?
- Yes.

399
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,500
<i> It was sad image
as always . </ i>

400
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,800
I do not believe .
- What year is it? What 's going on?

401
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,700
The TV does not work
not enough air .

402
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,700
These are cartridges , no one is watching ,
what I am playing .

403
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,500
Do not enter into the head.
- I remember everything.

404
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,100
On the night of the festival
with festive fire

405
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,400
children , how happy I am ...
- Do not have cable ?

406
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,100
Came a gentleman.
Spoke of a companion.

407
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,910
But I can not lie to me .
Just think how you skinned .

408
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Enter the village , up the hill
and after it, right on the border .

409
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,100
What's his name ?
- What?

410
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,500
Village.
- Zugaramurdi .

411
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,720
The village of witches !
- Which Witch ?

412
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,200
I have heard that there was a
witch hunt , and then burned them .

413
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,260
No longer afraid of witches.

414
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:27,000
I fear only some dirty bastards .
They are numerous and everywhere.

415
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,500
Soup is her , right?
- Yes , it's very tasty .

416
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,100
Gotcha .

417
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
Log in mouth
and out the ass .

418
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,500
Ass , right , huliganche ?

419
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Originally ... is kind of scary
but then it is very nice .

420
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,800
Out quite differently .
- Why?

421
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,800
Aga, Viga , IGA ...

422
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,700
Lag God zega ...

423
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,400

<i> not agree with you.

428
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,900
and what is that flavor ?

429
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,600
For what flavor you talking about?

430
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,900
What is it? Did you burn yourself ?

431
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,700
Demons have no security,
tunnels are so deep as a cave.

432
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,100
Council.
And do not think you're talking nonsense.

433
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
Never contradict them.
- Who ?

434
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,500
I agree with everything.
So it's best .

435
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,700
I warned you .
- What are you talking about?

436
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Shut up . Prat .
Get in the kitchen.

437
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,600
And do not think about eating spices.

438
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,200
Come on , it's all good.
Come on.

439
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,600
<i> Let me out .
Fuck you ! </ I>

Hi! I wanted to say something else.
Thank you very much .

442
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
<i> Open , please.
Bastards ? </ I>

443
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,900
Hey , folks! Take me with you .

444
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
We're friends ?

445
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,600
Godspeed !

446
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,900
On the night of the festival
with festive fire

447
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,500
children , kids , I'm happy ...

448
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Certainly act together .

449
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,800
He steals gold
it distracts ,

450
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,000
then meet in Paris
hat and stick.

451
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,100
I think it just wants to return his son.
Worried mother.

452
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,400
You never know
What they have in mind .

453
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,300
And what do they spin ?
- I do not know , but it is another .

454
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,200
They are spiders
weave their web around you.

455
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,500
Webs is your convenient
like you

456
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,400
and just as I get used to ,
Inject your poison.

457
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,200
Here 's what happens .
- Issues with Rachel ?

458
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Not one. Changed the codes
credit cards.

459
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,600
Alfonso , you're not left without money?

460
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,300
I understood from bank statements
I can not go .

461
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,100
She changed the locks?
- And my clothes thrown in the trash.

462
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Do you have a boyfriend?
- Me?

463
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,300
There is something on the horizon .
At least in my opinion.

464
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,800
Drop in January Until you waded deeper.

465
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,100
As clear that keeps the balls ,
take them .

466
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,000
From the root .

467
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,900
" Zugaramurdi - 2 km. "

468
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,800
Will not go.
- What is it?

469
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I will not go there.
- What nonsense are you saying?

470
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,900
Believe me, the village was cursed.
There was no Bacchanalia .

471
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,900
What is Bacchanalia ?
- As a party , but in the Middle Ages .

472
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,800
Shut up.
- Listen . This is not a psychic show

473
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,800
5 in the morning. Right?
This is serious. In short ...

474
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,800
You do not say anything ,
because I did not understand.

475
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,200
In their toilet ... There was a man.
- And ?

476
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,600
But if there was a girl ...
- He was inside the hole .

477
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,900
Where?
- It is impossible to explain.

478
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,600
But right from the hole below
one eye looking at me.

479
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,400
Listen ... Manuel .

480
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Manuel .

481
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,500
First, calm down.

482
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,500
Experienced a tense moment
and it is not easy .

483
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,900
It's not easy .
- We're all tired .

484
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Must safely pass through the village.
After half an hour we will be in France.

485
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,600
And it will not happen no more.
Nothing.

486
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,500
Safely through? No, Jose.
How do you not understand?

487
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,200
Witchcraft occurred here
right here, in a cave.

488
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,800
Demons , sacrifices everything.

489
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,400
Really. Not making this up .
Historical fact.

490
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,200
Very interesting where you read it?
- In historic mysteries .

491
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,940
I read everywhere.
At the airport , the station ... I have an obsession.

492
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,900
Moreover, with this bad karma.
- What's wrong with gold?

493
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
It is not gold, and rings .
Wedding rings .

494
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Do not you understand ?
There unfulfilled promises

495
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,900
Lost illusions , contempt , hatred,
setbacks , failures , misfortunes and lies ...

496
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,600
You're good to depressed people .
- Listen ...

497
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,100
Think it's a curse
we stole rings ?

498
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
On the road I saw two witches.

499
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,500
Did you now? You scared him !
- Asshole !

500
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,100
Start the car .

501
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,700
Take it easy.

502
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,300
Sergio , relax.

503
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,900
We go to great village
with wonderful people and ancient traditions.

504
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Attention!
- And nothing will happen .

505
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Attention! Attention!

506
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,000
Did you see that ? Did you see her ?

507
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
Fuck!

508

Let's see if she's dead?
- If she's alive , then I do not know .

00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,900
And if she's dead , really.
I do not know what to do.

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,550
This all is god knows what.

How else is here before us?
- It's true! We're in the car , dude !

528
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,900
Jose, do not touch !
- I'll just see what's inside.

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,300
Jose, throw it away .
- I'll get it.

530
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,700
Drop it! Give it to me !
- As a child you are. Drop it .

531
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,700
Stop it! Shit !

What a joker .

539
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
No, really, what did you see ?

540
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,600
Maybe it was an amulet
which holds a ticket.

541
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,000
Nadishahme is
not know the side effects.

542

and warns of the dangers

546
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,900
because he died there .
- But why did not you say anything?

547
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,400
Because it quickly crushed
but in time they will appear to others.

And I will say that is trampled a fee .

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,030
I do not want to see you again .

551

We're not from here , ma'am .
We're going to France and just go .

Typically, it is normal ,

564
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,100
But forget
to take the medicine ...

565
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,500
Sorry, ma'am ,

566
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,900
Apparently .
Okay, I'll keep looking .

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,200
Excuse me .
- No need.

568
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,800
It may sound presumptuous , but ...

Yes. I'll get myself though ...

But the doctor said
walks that are not harmful .

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,300
Sorry. Good night.
- Good night.

575
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,500
And what ? Why are you silent ?
Cat got your tongue ?

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,700
Sergio .

578
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm actually Grasiyana Barenecheya .

579

As a mom , grandmother and great-grandmother .
- Basque you ?

580
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,700
Barenecheya ... " moving house " .

581
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,100
My girlfriend was from Besaura .
I learned this and that.

582
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,000
Here there is

583
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,460
My husband did not like
to come here .

584
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,700
And finally divorced .

585
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,100
get freedom
and is now a priest.

586
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,000
Just imagine .

587
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,500
Eve ?

588
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,800
Nothing. Not at the bar or elsewhere .

589
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,200
Can be returned .
The door is broken .

590
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,200
Again forgot the keys?
- Forgive me, but I will go.

591
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,200
Maybe stay a .

592
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,640
An elderly woman wandering alone in the dark ,
anything could happen to her .

593
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,900
You can push it away.

594
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
Why just drive ?
It may be a tractor.

595
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,200
Well, gotta go.
It's too late and the child should sleep.

596
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Sergio ! Sergio !

597
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I am Tony , Princess.

598
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,400
Sergio ! Sergio !

599
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,300
Sergio !

600
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,600
Pardon the mess
But do not expect guests.

601
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,900
We have many things to break .

602
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
All children are.

603
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,400
Like little brother I wore
like crazy all over the house .

604
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,800
Thought me maze.
- You have a brother ?

605
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,800
Not less .
But my mother keeps him on a chain .

606
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,700
Very reasonable.

607
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,290
The only way to get them
to learn lessons.

608
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,200
And I do the same with Sergio ,

609
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,450
no TV
no internet and no cell phone.

610
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
This is Francisco, my great-grandfather .

611
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,600
He was a shepherd raised Palace
at the old barn .

612
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,800
Many sheep must sell .
- The sheep he died overnight.

613
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,600
He was very superstitious
and immediately set sail for Cuba.

614
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
To buy sugar?
- Then it was legal.

615
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There are dungeons , tunnels,
who joined the caves

616
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,400
with the village and go to France .
Tobacco , weapons and so on.

617
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,300
To live from something.

618
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Begonia , disappeared
but returned a month.

619
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,800
What is right?
- I do not dare to think.

620
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,900
Mom often telling us that she was a witch
and therefore buried her face down.

621
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,960
In what way?
- Literally .

622
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,900
All bury them face up
but it is buried upside down.

623
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,400
If you want to open the lid
and out ,

624
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,390
be diggin further down .

625
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,600
Get it ?
- Yes, that makes sense.

626
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,000
Admission is FREE .
- What is it?

627
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,200
PR.
Come any time.

628
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,800
We were here .
- It will not disappear and grandmother .

629
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,200
Old men and children are very similar .
- Can be somewhere together.

630
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,600
It is possible ,
Sergio is a very friendly boy.

631
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
His father was beautiful.
- Did he ?

632
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,400
He is divorced .
- Yes, but my son is feeling better.

633
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,400
He almost did not see it.
Alone with his mother 's poor child .

634
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,500
As with me, I try to focus
on the figure of his father.

635
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,380
This is very important for development.
- I love children .

636
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I'm like a child.
I just love to play .

637
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,980
To ? And what do you play?
- Uncle Doctor .

638
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,400
And you?
- The computer.

639
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,300
FIFA Master Hunter Grand Prix ...

640
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,500
I mostly like to play
to cook.

641
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,400
I love to cook .
If you want, now I'll cook you something.

642
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,800
One egg can not boil .
What about everything else.

643
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,700
Want me to show you my room ?
My toys are still there .

644
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,300
The idea is straight tip .

645
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,500
Why do not you find your son?

646
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,500
Yeah, right.
- Yes.

647
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,900
Agile child, huh?
- Yes, I know it , you'll love it .

648
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,200
He is very smart . Not only smart
a sensitive and honest.

649
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Cheerful in. .. gentle, delicate .

650
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,500
Where'd this son of a bitch fuck?

651
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
I'm very sorry .

652
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,000
My fault .

653
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,900
I should not have distracted
with their problems .

654
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,710
No fault , ma'am .
The child should be with his mother.

655
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,100
What are you doing , Mom ?
- None of your business .

656
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,100
That's my job.
- There you go again ?

657
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,200
Get out of here!

658
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
No! No!

659
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,000
Sergio !

660
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,700
This is not good , Mom.
It's not right .

661
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,700
No so .
- What are they doing here?

662
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,200
Sorry , but it is not right in the head .

663
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,000
Go to a psychiatrist
and drink a lot of drugs.

664
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,700
Not drink pills disoriented .
- Disoriented ?

665
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,110
Where the child suffered ?
- Excuse me .

666
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,600
Guys , please.
Please, Jose. Forgive us .

667
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,220
Importantly,
that the child 's nothing wrong .

668
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
Open , give me the boy.

669

There , Manuel !

670
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,300
And you 'll talk later.

671
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,800
But with respect,
this chest they breast fed .

672
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,600
Do not you recognize ?
- Taksimetardzhiyata , soldier and Christ.

673
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,780
And the one.
A little screwed up .

674
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,900
For a while it bake .
- And you wonder ?

675
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Good thing daddy could
to save time.

676
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,700
I love it .
- Then why not keep it?

Would you like a glass of sherry ?
- No, thank you.

764
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,300
What's this? Out for a minute
and you start again .

765
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,900
Do not you see that it is a noble lady?
Get in the kitchen!

766
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,600
No phone coverage.
- There is no coverage. Nothing grabs .

767
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,800
Tell . You must have a lot of visitors ,
but may have accidentally remembered

768
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,000
man of about 30 , vulgar
and nasty with boy.

769
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,600
I have not seen them .
- But the boy is my son .

770
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,600
Belichak ... a lot like me.

00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,900
No.
- Do you like me?

772
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I said that I did not see anything.

773
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,700
Wait, senor. And this nasty man ...
- Do you remember ?

774
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,600
Is your man ?
- How did you know?

775
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,700
I'm a witch.

00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,400
And did you see it ?
- No.

777
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,900

Go away. Leave me alone.
- Your son is a cutie .

00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,600
You saw it ? Where'd they go?
- Cigarettes .

785
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Come on, tell quickly.

786
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,900
Senor .

00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,100
Fuck.

Do not confuse the bread and wine .
Bread is bread ...

You still mad ?
Get the chest and threw him back .

The station does not work.
Ringing mobile .

I tried Range

I seem to only companion.
- No, not a companion.

807
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,200
You're my partner.
- But acting like a boss constantly .

808
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,600
Just giving orders .
I hear only give gas or stop.

809
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,300
Right, Left,
I drive and you sleep.

810
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,800
Buy donuts , play CDs.

811
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,100
God, I do not know what to say.
- Whatever it is

812
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,500
At least drop gratitude , nothing more.
At least one kind word .

813
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,400
What do you mean , dear ?

814
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,000
No, do not call her ,

815
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,800
Do not tell her . Lucky .
Gift of fate .

816
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,100
Already thought we missed them ,
and returned .

817
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,000
Yes.

818
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,300
Feast !
His father was with some friends .

819
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Can you imagine?

820
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,000
Yes.

821
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,400
Yes, yes . Better to stay
than not enough.

822
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,300
Jose.

823
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,230
Yes, you're right. Fortunately,
have a lot of specialties.

824
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,300
Yes, I said to them ,
tell them to bring the awesome wine.

825
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,200
Jose, Jose , listen.
- Shut up .

826
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:30,600
Entrusted your son, and you lose it .
- And better, managed to escape.

827
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,200
I can not believe it.
- What if we dream ?

828
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,300
You can not dream three simultaneously.
- It is not a dream, and hallucination.

829
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,600
Drugged us .
What was the mass of the grandmother ?

830
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,000
Acacia , cannabis, mushrooms,
These are the natural hallucinogen .

831
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,900
Aprons at the airport you learn it ?

832
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,400
Badajoz . Badajoz .

833
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,700
According to you, this is unreal ?
- It is only in your head.

834
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,300
Men are very stupid .

835
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,410
Dream or not , it is clear
that he had fallen on it.

836
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,100
Easy, just you think.

837
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,300
Dinner or party?
At dinner, we invited 30 people .

838
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,300
A party will come ...
you have no idea .

839
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:19,700
Thousands . No, we have not found the boy.
But look for it , you will soon find it.

840
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,300
Mom ! Mom !

841
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,800
Stay ! Stay !

842
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,400
Did you see that ?
- See what?

843
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,600
I do not know , something like a weak ram without skin.
- Must be a child .

844
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,500
Do we stop to see ?
- No, make straight.

845
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,400
Otherwise you will lose her .
- Here , you're welcome .

846
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,300
Watch where you're going , Jaime .

847
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,800
Stay !

848
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,500
We ran from the house of witches .
Dad returned to them .

849
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,200
They wanted me to bake in the oven .
There was a bald gentleman.

850
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,300
Get in the car quickly .

851
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
No, no .

852
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
No, no .

853
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,100
Where are you going ?
- Do not touch me . Let me out.

854
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,900
Let me out. I do not want the oven .

855
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,600
What 's going on?

856
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,500
God , the whole body hurts.

857
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,400
I think I broke something.

858
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,300
Where are we?

859
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,100
He opened his mouth . Case. Time.

860
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,800
All right.

861
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,000
Another minute .

862
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,500
Shit .
- Done.

863
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,900
Besides, I need balls of priest
and tears of the innocent.

864
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,220
Tears of the innocent does not concern me .
I'm a thief .

865
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,500
Practically a murderer .
- Seriously ?

866
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
You know, who is not a bad person?

867
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,400
He says.

868
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,600
Under the surface of badass
a soul of a child .

869
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,900
Sneaky lie. I'm drunk .

870
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,600
And get drunk , drive the car.
I'm really bad person.

871
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,500
I'm afraid the tears will not happen.
But with the balls you luck .

872
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,000
It seems to me
he looks like a priest.

873
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,800
Not even go to church .

874
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,900
I do not like that ride .
- I do not like quarrels . He started it.

875
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,570
Can not you shut up?
- Come on. Reconciled .

876
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,700
Yes, there is food for all .

877

Of course, as always .

878
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,000
Time.

Sergio !

911

Please let me !

912
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,800
Come lights . Come on.

Jaime , what are you doing?

I'm not your driver , Miss Daisy.
- This is no time to explain .

917
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,000
Sit behind the wheel and go.
- I sat down , but because I want to.

918
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,190
Not because you are commanded .
- Great trip I fix myself .

919
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,800
I know you watch me from Madrid.

920
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,100
Let's say that the investigation
in the same direction .

921
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Does not matter.
Do you have a gun?

922
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,100
Here we ask questions.
- Are you blind ?

923
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,000
My son is not with my husband .
Do not you see that he had been kidnapped ?

924
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,700
Damn !

925
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,000
Faster! Faster!

926
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,370
Do not miss them ! Hurry !

927
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,400
Open !

928
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,600
Open !
- Police! Police!

929
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,700
Open !

930
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,400
Police!
- Damn, Sylvia !

931
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,300
Sylvia !

932
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,600
Jose , sorry. I
you mean well , but it hurts.

933
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,000
Shut up.
- I can not stand , I will scream.

934
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,130
As you scream , but in silence . Right?
- Got it.

935
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,000
Sylvia !
- Sylvia !

936
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,600
Wait here, there may be dangerous .

937
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,300
I think we all have to wait here .

938
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,200
block perimeter
and wait for backup.

939
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,770
I think it can hardly
want to backup.

940
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,700
Alfonso , I'm coming !

941
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,800
Come on .
Sylvia me.

942
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,490
Eva , what did you put in?
- Fingers .

943
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,200
Do not push starter,

944
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,700
guests will not deal with the basics.
- Mom, why do you always picking ?

945
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,300
Oh , my daughter , my daughter.

946
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,900
Man eat of Badajoz .
- Honestly, it bothers me .

947
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,400
More annoys me lady
who calmly walking on the ceiling.

948
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,900
Do not forget that we are under anesthesia .
- Yes, indeed. I'm not here .

949
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Do not hurt me , no one eats ,
just hallucinations .

950
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,700
Take it easy.
- One thing is certain , Eva likes Jose.

951
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,600
Are you crazy ?

952
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:34,100
They'll kill us , and you think about sex .
- You can help us.

953
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,800
You only need to pass it .
- Manuel is right.

954
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,900
You're dry , at least smile .

955
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,800
Is that so hard ?
- She almost strangled him !

956
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,100
I do not do so, there is a protocol .
- Exactly.

957
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,600
First block perimeter
and then starts the action .

958
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,600
Stay ! Stay !
I thought I saw someone .

959
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,890
You scared me , Alfonso.
- Let me go first .

960
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,200
Senorita , please
What about me?

961
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,700
Dad !
- Sergio !

962
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,000
Sergio , are you okay ?
- Will give jelly

963
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,300
but with arms and legs , Dad.
- Drop it .

964
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,900
Hear what he's talking about.
Boy watching too much TV .

965
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,700
If you eat one here
just kissing .

966
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,300
Seems a little ... rougher ,
but only with foreigners.

967
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,500
If we know ,
will do anything for you.

968
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,900
Favorite food ,
but not dear boys like you.

969
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,700
Take him to the kitchen.

970
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,900
Quieter . More quietly , please.
- We try .

971
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,700
Be careful , please.
Senora ?

972
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,300
Girls. Your attention, please .

973
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
<i> sauce is simply gorgeous . </ i>

974
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,600
Yes, the wine is not bad.

975
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,700
Silence!

976
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,600
For many years
gather on this day,

977
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,900
closer to the end
this ridiculous civilization

978
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,500
encumber us
with its vulgarity .

979
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,500
To thank the Great Mother
for gifts

980
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,240
to taste
thanks to its infinite malice .

981
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,100
There obviously is no longer one coming .
- Quiet .

982
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,700
Just do not understand
why go up there .

983
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,300
Envy is our driving force .
Lie , betray and dishonor neighbor .

984
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,800
Vice of the age is our daily bread .
But all this , my dear ,

985
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,400
is insufficient.

986
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,500
False Prophet still
manages the entire world.

987
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,200
And she , despite all our efforts ,
as before,

988
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:47,900
is forced to hide underground.
Wait a few centuries our Messiah.

989
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,800
Destined to die and rise again
through the womb of the Goddess

990
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,300
to bring us final victory .

991
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,600
This is not our first experience.

992
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,900
These guys were 30 Grasiyana .

993
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,900
Not one or two, and 30 .

994
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,100
Fluffy, adorable ,
I do not understand where I went wrong .

995
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,100
It is not the quantity
and in quality.

996
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,600
To choose the Messiah is not
as to choose a bingo ticket .

997
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,800
Your mother did everything possible.
- More can not.

998
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,700
Judge , is very easy.
- Thank you, darling.

999
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,000
Nothing.
- Well, what's done either .

1000
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,700
One thing is certain ,
We needed a miracle.

1001
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,200
I hear voices. Bottom.

1002
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,300
Today <i> finally
enable us ... </ i>

1003
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,200
They are there , do you ?

1004
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,800
Everything is perfect .
The stars are with us.

1005
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,700
Silence.

1006
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,500
All anguish , pain and suffering,
hidden in these rings

1007
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,200
will give us enough strength ,
this time our call to reach your goal

1008
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,000
and from the depths to lift that
whose power over the world

1009
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,900
hers by right.

1010
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,900
What?
- I do not know such a ritual.

1011
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,400
I realized that the ritual concerns the child.

1012
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
Give me the bag.
- Get out .

1013
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,100
Get out !

1014
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,800
Kill them !

1015
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,600
Jose , I saw everything!

1016
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,100
And I will not forget it !
Do you hear ?

1017
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,600
Get them!

1018
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,800
Why is your wife here?
- Came to meet her boyfriend .

1019
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,000
Do not compare them .
She did not lead police right?

1020
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,060
I do not think the police
need to fear .

1021
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,200
Give your child !
- When will you pay me ?

1022
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,700
Then we'll deal with that.
- Get ready to run ! One, two ...

1023
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,870
Where to run?
- It does not matter !

1024
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,000
How are her ?
- Get a small office

1025
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,900
in the Government of Navarra .
- Really?

1026
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Good for her , it's very smart.
- Given that suffered so much.

1027
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,600
The poor child.
- How are you feeling , dear?

1028
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,900
Did they give her to eat ?
An empty stomach can react badly .

1029
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,400
I have pills.
- Better something warm .

1030
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,500
Lime or mint tea .

1031
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,200
Try, try .
This is delicious and useful.

1032
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,100
Wider , wider.

1033
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,100
Something no appetite .
- Normal .

1034
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,500
Her head is tired is complete
with thought and care

1035
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,700
men and family.
But it 's all in the past, honey.

1036
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,690
Relax, today will like a queen .
- And you have new friends.

1037
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,600
Run along the corridor .
At the end of a ladder .

1038
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,900
Climb down , turn left
As you approach the roof

1039
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,300
on the right you will see a door .
Do you understand?

1040
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,610
I'll meet you at the river .
- Good.

1041
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,700
Wait!

1042
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
And the others?
- What else?

1043
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,900
You will not leave them here?

1044
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,800
I do enough?
- No, but yes.

1045
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,770
Yeah, but ...

1046
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,400
Would you rather be with them
instead of me?

1047
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,000
No, not at all.
I just thought that if I go ,

1048
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,400
can they. It's all over.

1049
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,100
Do you understand?

1050
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,400
Trust me , darling.

1051
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,100
Better if I had not heard
what he said now.

1052
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,600
Yeah, right . I mean, I'm not quite clear
what to say,

1053
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,910
but I will say anything you want .

1054
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,900
To think I'm an idiot ?
- No. No.

1055
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,600
It is not . Never.
- Do you love me ?

1056
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,900
What?
- I gave my family for you.

1057
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,500
I gave you everything .
- I loved it .

1058
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,200
A lot.
- No.

1059
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,300
You want to forget your friends?
But understand ,

1060
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,500
leaving his son is cruel .
- Just looking for an excuse to dump me .

1061
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,500
Dump ?
But I'm crazy about you .

1062
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,980
But I'm not the most important thing in your life .

1063
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,300
At all ... you know what?

1064
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,900
Yeah, you're the most important thing in my life.
I just ...

1065
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,620
Should I exclude everything else?
Can not combine it ?

1066
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,300
Where is Jose ?
- I do not know .

1067
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
What do we do ?
- We go!

1068
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,000
Run fast !

1069
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,600
Manuel bag. Give me the bag .
- What is it?

1070
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,500
Should be there , I remember.
Patron of hopeless .

1071
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,400
Here it is , St. Jude .

1072
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,000
Tony, to run !

1073
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,200
Here , Tony !

1074
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,200
Me or nothing.
- You, my love.

1075
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,300
You forever.
- You're lying.

1076
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,300
You just scared me.

1077
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,400
This ... I will not deny it.

1078
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,970
Maybe the time is not very
appropriate, but I love you.

1079
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,800
Do not love me .

1080
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:44,100
You think I'm a monster.
- What monster? You are my love .

1081
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:48,340
Do not you dare contradict me .
- Whatever you say , there is not.

1082
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,300
I hate you!

1083
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,330
Do not you think you're taking things
very emotional ?

1084
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,200
Just amazing.
- I do not believe in saints.

1085
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:49,700
Well done, Tony. It was great.
- Male you have done ?

1086
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,800
And how .
- This is cool.

1087
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,900
That's how I do things.

1088
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,150
I am now able
to conquer the world , fuck .

1089
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,600
I feel alive.
I feel ... I do not know .

1090
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,100
I feel man .
- When I say Sonia will go mad .

1091
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,000
And will admit you without a job ?
- Yes, for sure.

1092
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,400
I'll tell her everything
and speak what you want.

1093
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,200
I'll catch the bull by the horns .
Will open a disco.

1094
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,700
I'll have my car
my house , my dog,

1095
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,670
which will be called Peppers .
And God himself will not stop me .

1096
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,400
Hello !

1097
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,000
Who is it?

1098
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,600
Help , I ...

1099
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,700
Fuck you .

1100
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,400
Read the complete works
Marseille Lafuente ,

1101
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,400
ie " Estafania ."
- What?

1102
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,500
This is the cathedral Cathedral in Burgos
I did frog bones

1103
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,400
targets 16,000 .
- And how long it took ?

1104
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,500
Almost 15 years.
- Got it.

1105
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,000
I. .. I constantly here?
- Yes, all the time.

1106
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,200
And I like it.
As you get used , is very convenient.

1107
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,000
And that , and that the door is always closed.

1108
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,100
Let's try to go here .

1109
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,200
Wait .

1110
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,400
There is a crack .
- Right. So the outcome is close.

1111
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,500
Tony.
- Manuel .

1112
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,000
Turn on there.

1113
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,800
Did you see anything there?
- No.

1114
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,100
No, I saw something, but I do not know what.

1115
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,620
To return it?
- The world once more.

1116
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,000
Please.

1117
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,100
We do not do anything wrong.

1118
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,900
My sister takes care of me.
It brings me books.

1119
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,400
But now it became worse
because they do not publish them anymore.

1120
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,400
Your sister is lovely.
A little nervous

1121
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,200
but it is charming .
- I'm Luis Miguel .

1122
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,000
I am Jose. Jose Fernandez .

1123
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,100
My skin has been lifted ,
because of the moisture .

1124
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,000
No, it's okay.
Normal is

1125
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,900
It's not

1126
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,600
Do calmly .

1127
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,000
Nothing , relax.

1128
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,400
About Evil is most important in life.

1129
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,900
What a disgrace .
- I will not let this so beautiful.

1130
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,600
We'll talk after the ritual.
- Mom , come on.

1131
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:48,900
See how upset his grandmother.
Well, that is retarded and does not remember anything.

1132
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,100
Such a thing never happened
in this house .

1133
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,500
Girls your age
should be doing drugs ,

1134
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,000
not to waste their time with nonsense .

1135
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,300
Your age I was constantly
drugged . Properly.

1136
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,400
Men are to be milked for money.

1137
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,400
Why not caught with dirty sex
as friends?

1138
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,900
BDSM , incest .
- Koprofagiya , fetishism .

1139
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,300
Bestiality .
- Urofiliya , fitting bandage .

1140
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,400
Jockstrap ? What's this?
- Concha , you're behind .

1141
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,900
How much it cost me to hook you up
in the worst school

1142
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,700
Now tell me ,
you like this man

1143
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,000
because it is good?
- How does only .

1144
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,900
With those eyes.
- There are eyes. Then pull them out .

1145
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,700
Use it only
as a sex toy .

1146
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,600
And what would you play ?
Of " Guess the word" ?

1147
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:37,600
He cries as ends.
- What? Really?

1148
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,600
A look real macho .
- Just seems.

1149
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,700
I read in " Cosmopolitan "
that in men decreases potency .

1150
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,100
I know. You're right.

1151
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,500
But I do not understand
what happens to me.

1152
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,700
Just thinking about it
and I feel butterflies in his stomach.

1153
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,800
What feelings?
- Butterflies .

1154
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,600
But please.
- I seem to fall in love.

1155
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,700
What did you do ?

1156
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,800
My mother screaming , you hear?

1157
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,900
No.
- I can hear everything that goes on in the house.

1158
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
And my son hear?
- Yes.

1159
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,100
Son crying.

1160
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,200
However, it is normally
preparing him for the sacrifice.

1161
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,700
Sacrifice ?
Where is this cave ?

1162
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,300
Where is the cave ?

1163
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,370
If you do not notice you , you
to go through the tunnel under the cemetery.

1164
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,500
Chapter 10th . Point .

1165
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,600
" The antics of Sheriff
err

1166
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:42,100
fucked it up . "
Said the inspector .

1167
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,100
Viz.

1168
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,940
They say God created man
own image and likeness .

1169
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,900
The question is , who you think you are?

1170
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,800
Woman was created in the image
and likeness of God.

1171
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,400
Yes !

1172
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,900
Some of you believe in stupid
story of Adam and his rib ?

1173
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,500
No!

1174
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,100
Where is the blessed abode ?
- In the grave !

1175
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,800
Who is God?
- Great Mother !

1176
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,800
Who are her favorite daughter?

1177
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,900
We witches !

1178
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,800
Sow terror in the masculine
because we know the truth.

1179
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,600
God is a woman and they can not
come to terms with it.

1180
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:30,400
We do not believe in good and evil.
Heaven and hell .

1181
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
In virtue and vice.

1182
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,100
There is only one truth
in the entire universe .

1183
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:39,000
Great omnipresent goddess
Ruthless mother

1184
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:43,000
cruel daughter
and practical spirit .

1185
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,700
They deracinated
our instincts

1186
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,100
they confused with guilt our souls
and give us the sex of contempt.

1187
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,700
But now it's time
vengeance .

1188
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,000
Today she'll be back .

1189
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,200
Long live justice !

1190
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,500
Justice ! Justice !

1191
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,300
Justice !
- What you idiot ?

1192
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,000
I do not know .

1193
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,600
Got carried away a bit .

1194
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:13,000
It will eat it , that's the point.
- Who is she?

1195
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:16,500
If the child survives , it will be reborn .
Like me.

1196
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,500
How would you live if you eat it ?

1197
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,200
You see me? I managed .
- I prefer not to think .

1198
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,100
Do you hear ?
- What?

1199
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,400
Rapid breathing , scraping claws
on a tree , the air is not enough.

1200
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,100
Do not bullshit me .

1201
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,200
Fuck.
- Help me . Faster. Quickly.

1202
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,300
Shit .
- Go ahead.

1203
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,700
Mom did that ?

1204
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,700
Who else could ?
- Luismi , what are you doing here?

1205
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,600
If mom finds out you're gone
the room will be punished.

1206
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,800
I was naughty .
- Untie me .

1207
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,200
Hope not .
Much like his mother.

1208
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:12,900
Jose. Why do that ?
I know we had something .

1209
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,900
Why your mother is arrested ?
- None of your business .

1210
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,100
She had fallen on you.

1211
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,000
Luismi .
- Confessed Mom

1212
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:26,500
and she decided to bring her to reason .
- Luismi , I'll remind him .

1213
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,120
Me free,
I'll kill you both.

1214
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,900
Jose ... why did not you say ?

1215
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,900
Feel anything?

1216
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:41,300
I ... Sorry , Eva .
Recently divorced and I'm sorry .

1217
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,900
Many will regret it.

1218
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,100
I can not get involved with women
that make me crazy .

1219
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,200
All the crazy fall on me.
I want someone normal .

1220
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,500
Let's go to the movies and coffee .
- But I'm perfectly normal .

1221
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,500
Luismi to go.

1222
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,600
Hey , stay ! Where are you going ?

1223
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,500
To stop mother to destroy
Western civilization .

1224
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,100
Do you mind?
- Jose.

1225
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,400
You can not talk to me .

1226
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,500
Luismi , tell him to come back.
- Come on.

1227
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,400
Luismi who loves you more than me?

1228
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,300
Luismi , it will close .
Luismi !

1229
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,900
What's that smell?
- It smells like sulfur.

1230
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,600
Do not burn our hair of the feet .

1231
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:24,000
How forests person?
- I do not know the first time I burn .

1232
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,100
I think for about an hour.
- An hour ?

1233
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,100
So long?
- Yes. But first , you will choke .

1234
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,700
There is no bad without good.
- We've got no more than 20 minutes.

1235
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,700
Alfonso. Alfonso !
- What?

1236
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,600
While I'm not dead , I mean ,
it was a pleasure working with you.

1237
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,500
And for me, Jaime .
- I'll tell you something else .

1238
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,100
Shoot.
- I can not. I'm ashamed 's

1239
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,620
Come on, Jaime .
We've known all my life.

1240
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,500
Only if we were alone.
- Nonsense .

1241
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,800
We did not to that.
- You never understood.

1242
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,400
I did not understand what?
- Even when I fell

1243
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,500
on you in the karaoke ?

1244
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,700
Come on, tell me now , do not torment us .

1245
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,500
I like you .
- What?

1246
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,800
As a man , you know?

1247
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,200
Why not burn , is not it time ?

1248
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,100
Jaime . You're my friend , I appreciate very much ,

1249
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,500
but I fear that it is neither the time
nor the place to talk about it .

1250
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,700
Burning with shame.
- Yes.

1251
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,400
Not so hard ,
was not the end of the world.

1252
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,100
I'm not sure.

1253
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,600
Is that so hard
to say something nice.

1254
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,500
Like die.
- Stop bothering me .

1255
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,300
Uncomfortable
and the need to think.

1256
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:24,700
Why am I here , damn it !
I did not do anything!

1257
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:44,090
Fuck. Has emerged is
That missing.

1258
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,600
Shit .

Damn .

1260
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,200
Sergio ! Sergio !

1261
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,900
Let me out! Let me out!

1262
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,400

What are you waiting for ?

1266
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,400
See?

1267
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,700
Your little boy is alive .

1268
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:47,500
This is chosen,
the fruit of the womb of the Great Mother .

1269
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,300
Androgynous .
This man will become an enemy of the men

1270
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,200
and avenge us.

1271
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,540
It will be our Trojan horse.

1272
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,100
Dad ! Dad , I'm fine !

1273
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,000
Everything is fine.

1274
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,300
Luismi !

1275
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,800
No, I do not want there.

1276
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,900
No!

1277
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,000
I'm going crazy !

1278
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,700
Oh, God !

1279
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,600
She ate it !

1280
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,900
We gotta get out of here right now .
- Do you have a plan?

1281
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,600
Jose. You have to trust me.
- You know her weak spot?

1282
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:18,500
Yes.

1283
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,500
But I need your help .
- What to do?

1284
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,800
Only distraction .
- How to distract ?

1285
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,100
Jose !

1286
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,940
She did not go immediately to swallow !

1287
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,700
Hang in there and turn it over!
- I'll try !

1288
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,300
Turn it to me
not there, the other side!

1289
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,710
Anything else?
- No, God, no way!

1290
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,100
What are you doing ? To me ! Clear ?

1291
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,400
Bravo ! Now believe me !

1292
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,800
To death!
- I love you!

1293
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,400
And I !

1294
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,000

1295
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,700
Eva !

1296
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,800
Goddess !

1297
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,100
Eva !

1298
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:43,200
Do you really think
Eva will take care of your son?

1299
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,740
What you promised ?
That will change?

1300
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,900
No need to change.
I like her one with nature

1301
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,400
Quick, get out .
- Get out !

1302
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,200
Do not go !
- Here , get it!

1303
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,700
Someday I'll rip your heart out .

1304
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,890
We'll see.
Mind if I take my son?

1305
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,200
He revived inside her .
Since today is ours.

1306
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,200
Sergio . Sergio , tell me .

1307
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:18,500
Who do you want to be?
Dad or this lady ?

1308
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,050
With this lady .
- Come home quickly !

1309
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,500

01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,700
Manuel , please help me !

1317
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,300
Mom?
- Sylvia , just wanted to talk to you.

1318
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,200
Too.

1319
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:35,100
I'll complain to the court.
- And you 're right. I'm a terrible father .

1320
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,400
I'll rip thousands of small pieces.
- Take it easy .

Yes, dragged our son robbery
Now eat it monster

this is not the best for a child .

1323
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:47,200
But what can I say?
I just wanted to see him.

1324
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,600
Help me , Manuel !

1325
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:54,400
My hands burn !
- Naturally !

1326
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,090
You need to understand
because of our son .

1327
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,400
Let me , damn witch !

1328
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,900
Thy kingdom over, Mother.
The war is lost.

1329
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,200
What are you thinking ? Give me that!

1330
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:25,100
Do you think I'll let
to come close to our son ?

1331
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,100
Relax, everything is fine .

1332
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,000
Easy, easy.

1333
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,500
Let's run , let's get out of here!

1334
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,800

1337
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,700
Alfonso , what ...

1338
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,300
what I said then.
- Yes ?

1339
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500
Get it out of my head.

1340
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,600
I , Jaime .
I found ... I like .

1341
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,500
Are you serious?

1342
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,800
<b> month later </ b>

1343
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,200
His turn!

1344
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:42,500
Maybe I should not have let him do ?
- Come on, will not become anything wrong.

1345
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,000
Remember , what the psychologist said .
If pushing the child

1346
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,920
may have the opposite effect.

1347
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,500
Whatever you say, dear.

1348
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:59,800
Tell her that this action does not scare me .
I still have something against her ...

1349
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,500
Pardon the interruption ,
but we're working hours.

1350
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,650
My girl is tired
and needs a break .

1351
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:34,100
Bravo !

1352
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,000
Will be a big shot ,
grow up . You will see Manuel .

1353

Banker. Right?
- Yes. It's possible

1354

With pleasure , I love it .

1356
