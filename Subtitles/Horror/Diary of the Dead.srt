1
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,383
628 Tremont.
6-2-8, three Dead.

2
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:39,280
- Not here.
- The fuckin' usual.

3
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:42,070
So no big deal these days, right?
Some guy, what's his name?

4
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,754
- Uh, I don't know.
- Who knows, who cares.

5
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:44,755
Who cares.

6
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:45,922
Fuckin'.

7
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,900
Shoots his wife and kid,
and eats the fuckin' licorice.

8
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,844
Sticks it in his mouth
and blows his fuckin' brains out.

9
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,788
This guy has no ID,
no fuckin' papers.

10
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,904
He probably squirreled over
the goddamn border.

11
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,105
Hey guys.
Channel 13.

12
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:03,329
Listen up, you're kind of blocking the shot,
can I get you to move forward a bit?

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,157
- Yeah sure.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,984
- You Ready?
- Yeah, almost.

15
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,185
Two minutes. (inaudible)
and we'll roll.

16
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,141
- Can't get close enough for an Emmy.
- Screw the Emmy!

17
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:15,738
- Settle for a fuckin' paycheck.
- Story of my life.

18
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,393
<i>We downloaded this video off the internet
sometime over the last three days,</i>

19
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,413
<i>I can't remember
exactly when.</i>

20
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,876
Look at this guy.
Look at this fuckin' guy!

21
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:28,339
Chowing down while his buddies are
shoving a corpse in the back of the van.

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,744
<i>Some of this footage
was never broadcast.</i>

23
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:33,534
<i>It was secretly uploaded by
the cameraman who shot it.</i>

24
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:37,959
<i>It was his way of trying to tell the truth
about what was happening.</i>

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,172
Bree Reno, reporting live
from Homestead,

26
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:42,672
where tragedy be-felled
an immigrant family.

27
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:47,097
An unidentified man has shot his
wife and 16 year old son to death

28
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:49,523
before turning the
gun on himself.

29
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:51,663
- Jesus!
- What?

30
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,141
- I don't believe this!
- What?

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,513
Is there something wrong with
the camera, just fix it!

32
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:56,190
She's still moving!

33
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,086
For Christ sake, Willy,
I'm right in the middle of...

34
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:00,595
- What?
- Jesus fuckin' Christ!

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,000
For god's sake!

36
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:05,470
- I thought they were dead.
- They're supposed to be, they are!

37
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,164
I don't know, she's moving on
the freakin' gurney man!

38
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:12,465
- Get out of the way, come on.
- I need some backup here.

39
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,417
Get off of him!

40
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:19,803
- Are you all right?
- Jesus, what the fuck was that?

41
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:23,804
- Keep still.
- The other ones moving!

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,211
Another one coming up too.

43
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,021
Take them out!

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,595
He's not going down.
He's not going down!

45
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,488
Holy shit!

46
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:48,412
Freeze!

47
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,490
You must shoot
them in the head!

48
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:56,262
No! No!
This can't be happening!

49
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,581
This can't be fuckin' happening!

50
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:06,650
<i>We downloaded a lot of what we found
off on television, on the net, off blogs.</i>

51
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:09,776
<i>Images and commentaries
over those first few days.</i>

52
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:13,383
<i>Most of it was bullshit.
None of it was useful.</i>

53
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,980
<i>This is what we were getting
from the news networks.</i>

54
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,617
<i>None of us can
claim to know exactly</i>

55
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:20,076
<i>what has caused the chaos,
that we've stand from experience.</i>

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,600
<i>A natural calamity or sort of
a massive or monstrous hoax?</i>

57
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,174
<i>I'm old enough to
remember Orson Wells'</i>

58
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:30,828
<i>'War of  the World's,' possibly the
greatest hoax ever perpetrated.</i>

59
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,450
<i>That was just radio.
Now, it’s 24/7.</i>

60
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,209
<i>This is some kind of...</i>

61
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:41,857
<i>we are led to believe
almost anything...</i>

62
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:45,512
<i>We made a film,
the one I'm going to show you now.</i>

63
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:49,638
<i>Actually, Jason was the
one who wanted to make it.</i>

64
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,197
<i>Like that camera man
from Channel 13,</i>

65
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:57,440
<i>He wanted to upload it so that people,
you, could be told the truth.</i>

66
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:02,478
<i>The film was shot with a
Panasonic HDX-900-and a HVX-200.</i>

67
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,520
<i>I did the final cut
on Jason's laptop.</i>

68
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:10,330
<i>I've added music occasionally
for effects, hoping to scare you.</i>

69
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,975
<i>You see, in addition to
trying to tell you the truth</i>

70
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:15,501
<i>I am hoping to scare you,</i>

71
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,027
<i>so that maybe
you'll wake up.</i>

72
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,643
<i>Maybe you won't make any of
the same mistakes that we made.</i>

73
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,119
<i>Anyway, here it is:</i>

74
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,127
<i>Jason Creed: The Death of Death.</i>

75
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,620
No!
Cut! Cut!

76
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,718
How many times have I told you
that these things don't move fast?

77
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:04,797
You're a corpse,
for Christ sake!

78
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,636
If you run that fast,
your ankles are gonna snap off.

79
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,413
She's going fast, I have to go fast,
otherwise how am I supposed to catch her?

80
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:15,165
You're supposed to catch her later.
This is the beginning of the fuckin' movie.

81
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,848
You catch her now,
it's all over.

82
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,273
All you're supposed to do
is grab her dress, till...

83
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,861
...till my tits fall out?
Ain't gonna happen!

84
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,785
You know, can somebody
please explain to me

85
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:29,173
why girls in scary movies always have to
fall down and lose their shoes and shit?

86
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,864
It's totally lame.

87
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,461
And why do we do have to get
our dresses torn off?

88
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,225
Actually, I'm looking
forward to that part.

89
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,815
- Flashing!
- I swear...

90
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,398
- Thanks.

91
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,729
Ah shit man, look at this,
your makeup is all unglued.

92
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,221
Give me a break!

93
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,492
Yeah, maybe you can see now,
because you're in way too tight.

94
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,717
All you're supposed to do
is run into the fuckin' shot.

95
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,792
No, not run...
shamble.

96
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:54,022
The script says the mummy
shambles into the frame and stops

97
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,867
for a second...
for one second.

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,923
You're telling me in one second you can see...
-The camera can see

99
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,250
and what the camera sees,
the audience will see.

100
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:01,887
What fuckin' audience?

101
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:05,195
There's always an audience for horror,
believable horror.

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,055
But who's gonna believe a mummy
if his makeup is all unglued?

103
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:10,352
Who's gonna believe a
mummy in the first place?

104
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,429
Here's a thought, genius.

105
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,624
Try zooming out, maybe
your fuckin' shot will work.

106
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,318
I know what I want here, Tony,
and I know what I'm doing.

107
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,804
That's right, you do,
don't ya?

108
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,076
We're only what, four days over
a three day shooting schedule?

109
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,442
Great, you're doing fine.
I hope we'll get fuckin' credits.

110
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,142
- You'll all be in the credits.
- Talking about college credits.

111
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:30,562
Leave those to me.

112
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,790
- Did we get the shot yet?
- No, we're still dickin' around.

113
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,448
Five credits for the each of you,
that's a pledge.

114
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,767
Mr. Creed has a vision.

115
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:44,379
Hey, I'm just trying to
make a scary movie here.

116
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,639
Yes, you are,
Mr. Creed.

117
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,357
<i>Jason always wanted to
be a documentary filmmaker,</i>

118
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,269
<i>but for his senior class project,</i>

119
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,817
<i>he decided to try to make
a horror film instead.</i>

120
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,930
<i>In fact, that's what he was
shooting on that first night.</i>

121
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,809
<i>The night, when...</i>

122
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,615
<i>everything changed.</i>

123
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:01,635
Stupid fuckin'
horror movie.

124
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,329
With an underlying
thread of social satire.

125
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,157
Jason, can I
take a minute?

126
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,321
- I have to pee.
- Oh shit. Alright.

127
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,097
- Jason...
- What?

128
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,830
I have to pee, too.

129
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,801
Jesus Christ, this whole
thing is falling apart.

130
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:18,603
Hey guys, uh, there's something
on the news. It's pretty...

131
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:21,790
well, I mean...
you might want to check this out.

132
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:25,731
<i>...but it does seem to happening.</i>

133
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,718
<i>Two news agencies in two separate
counties in the tri-state area</i>

134
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:32,903
<i>are reporting accounts
of the dead returning to life.</i>

135
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:36,471
<i>In one of the cases, the one
in Summerset, the dead man,</i>

136
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,563
<i>identified as a
50 year old white male,</i>

137
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,912
<i>the victim of a drive-by
shooting yesterday,</i>

138
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:46,087
<i>sat up on the autopsy table and actually
attacked Somerset medical examiners...</i>

139
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:48,876
- Horseshit.
- Shut up, Tony, it's on the fuckin' news.

140
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:53,494
The news is always horseshit. Always makes
things sound worse than they really are.

141
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,115
That's how they
sell soap.

142
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:58,222
And the next morning what happens?
"Oh sorry, our mistake."

143
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,710
and when they say that, who's gonna
believe this shit, two dead people...

144
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,115
<i>There are now
five dead people and...</i>

145
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,520
<i>here's another.
They're coming in from everywhere.</i>

146
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,599
<i>A corpse at Hope Memorial,
has apparently survived.</i>

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,839
<i>That’s six separate reports.</i>

148
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,147
Six?
How could there be six mistakes?

149
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,746
For Christ’s sake, we hear
those sort of thing every day.

150
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:19,112
Yeah, the hurricane,
the planet gettin' too hot,

151
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:23,154
and the terrorist that was gonna dump a dirty
bomb on the Whitehouse or your house.

152
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:26,906
Somebody gonna put some germs
in your water or your mailbox.

153
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,407
and that letter from
Publisher's Clearing House, huh?

154
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,428
The good news is you
won a million bucks,

155
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,025
bad news is you'll gonna
wake up dead tomorrow morning.

156
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:35,853
Better believe what
we've just heard,

157
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:39,606
the problem doesn't seem to be
that people are waking up dead.

158
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,882
But that dead people
are waking up.

159
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,280
Listen!

160
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,572
- What's that?
- What was that?

161
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,268
<i>A lot of people
are in on it.</i>

162
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,269
Right.

163
00:08:55,001 --> 00:09:00,003
If I'm gonna wake up dead,
it's gonna be in my own bedroom.

164
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,204
You can all come.

165
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,044
Eliot has the address,
he knows where is it.

166
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:08,373
Yeah, nice place too.
Cozy, takes up about half of Philadelphia.

167
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:12,510
Yeah, it's a fuckin' fortress.
I can't get in unless I'm invited.

168
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,676
Sorry Jason, you're
worried about your movie.

169
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,840
I don't mean to hang you
up or anything, but...

170
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,741
I'm gettin' the fuck out of here.

171
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,444
Like I said,
you can all come.

172
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:28,001
I mean it.
It's an invitation.

173
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:31,502
I'm in.

174
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,509
- Anyone else?
- Better be not.

175
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,386
Bye guys.

176
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,744
Fuckin' pommy gets all the girls.

177
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:50,745
So...

178
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,336
What are we going to do?

179
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,306
<i>- How do you explain, that...
- I have no explanation.</i>

180
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,653
OK, what I'm
going to do.

181
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:01,004
I'm going to the dorm,
Deb's there.

182
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,911
Whatever's happening,
I don't want her to be alone.

183
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,160
<i>Transmit electrical
impulses</i>

184
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,369
<i>strong enough,
to animate what little</i>

185
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,995
<i>remains of the body's
muscle tissues.</i>

186
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:18,935
OK.

187
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,841
OK, this is the women's dorm.

188
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:28,749
Jesus.

189
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,535
It's been 25 minutes
since we've heard the news,

190
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,312
and it looks like
everybody's gone.

191
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,199
Hello, who's
in there?

192
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Fuck.

193
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,820
What the fuck are
you doing here?

194
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,899
- What the fuck you're doing here?
- I'm stealing shit.

195
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,900
What about you...?

196
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:03,153
What's a guy with a video
camera doing in the women's dorm?

197
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,154
Security!

198
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:08,195
Fuck.

199
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,119
Oh god.

200
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:12,583
Oh shit.

201
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:22,877
OK, OK, this is
Deb's room.

202
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,607
- Wait! It's OK. It's me.
- Jesus, fuck..

203
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,459
Are you still
shooting?

204
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,601
- What're you shooting?
- I'm just...

205
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:41,388
Oh my god!

206
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:47,180
- God, I'm so afraid.
- It's OK, Deb.

207
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,528
I'm here.

208
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:54,226
I've been trying to call them,
for like an hour...

209
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,230
Shit!

210
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,713
Shit! Same fuckin' thing,
no answer!

211
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,253
Gotta get out there,
we'll see everything.

212
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,552
- Babe!
- What?

213
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:18,678
There's no answer at my house.
My mom, my dad, Billie...

214
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,469
- They're supposed to be there!
- Maybe they're up at the cabin.

215
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,645
No, I already tried there.
Everything's out.

216
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:32,341
The circuits are busy, your folks probably
can't get through to you either.

217
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:35,900
<i>It was all over the news,
all over the web.</i>

218
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,210
<i>But no one knew what
was really happening.</i>

219
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,111
I wanna get out of here.

220
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,519
J!

221
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:43,994
I want to go home.

222
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,274
<i>I think that's what
started the panic,</i>

223
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,750
<i>not knowing the truth.</i>

224
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,816
<i>What's been happening?
I don't know,</i>

225
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,800
<i>the prospects
truly are terrifying.</i>

226
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:02,846
<i>All my friends left before
we could even say goodbye.</i>

227
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:07,458
<i>It's funny. You spend some much
time resenting your parents,</i>

228
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,960
<i>separating yourself,
building your own life,</i>

229
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:13,615
<i>but when the shit hits the fan,
the only place you want to go is</i>

230
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:14,616
<i>home.</i>

231
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,587
We're in Mary's
Winnebago,

232
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,543
trying to stick together.

233
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:24,254
- What is this about, Jason?
- I don't know, I just...

234
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:27,237
if this turns out to be a big thing,
I just want to record it, OK?

235
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,642
Come on everybody, when it
comes to you, say your names.

236
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,843
This is ridiculous.

237
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,629
- Mary. Mary Dexter.
- What are you doing here, Mary?

238
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,516
I'm going home...
trying to go home.

239
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,660
Can you just not film me
while I'm driving, please?...

240
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:45,841
so I can focus.

241
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:46,870
Say your name.

242
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,616
Jason, if you don't know
my name by now

243
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,407
then you can get your clothes
out of my closet, OK?

244
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:51,930
Come on, babe,
it's part of history.

245
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,874
Debra Moynahan.

246
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,626
And I'm trying to get home too, OK?
Like Mary.

247
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,849
And I'm wondering why my boyfriend
has a camera plastered to his face.

248
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,619
Scranton. OK?

249
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,976
Scranton. Pennsylvania.
That's my home.

250
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:14,194
It's my parent's home.
And my little brother's.

251
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,440
- Where are you coming from?
- College.

252
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,987
We're all at Pitt together.
University of Pittsburgh.

253
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,777
- Why are we on the road?
- Christ.

254
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,664
Yeah, Christ, Jason.
Lay the fuck off!

255
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:28,630
See this guy?

256
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,874
He won't say who he is, so I will.
He's Tony Ravello. He's from...

257
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,073
- Where is he from? Brooklyn or the Bronx?
- Queens.

258
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,670
He does makeup
that comes unglued.

259
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,934
You know what?
I'm a directing major, just like you.

260
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:43,247
- I wasn't supposed to do makeup.
- No, I was.

261
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,223
Sorry, babe.

262
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,636
You know what happens
when we try to work together.

263
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:48,864
I hear that.

264
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,030
Why are we here
on the road?

265
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:58,757
- Just trying to get out of Dodge right now.
- Why?

266
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,335
What do you want
me to say, Jason?

267
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:04,264
No, it's not what I want you want to say,
it’s what you want to say. Tell us...

268
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,814
Why does everyone wanna
get the hell out of Dodge?

269
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:10,510
Cause of this thing, this crazy
thing that's happenin'.

270
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:11,737
It is crazy.

271
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:15,293
- Where are you going, Tony?
- Nowhere. No place to go.

272
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:19,369
Except to hang with you, Jason,
until I can't take any more of your shit.

273
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,335
Hey, guys!

274
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,010
<i>Can you explain why the department
of Homeland Security suddenly</i>

275
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,693
<i>raised its alert level to orange
earlier this evening</i>

276
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:28,921
<i>even though there are no
indications of a terrorist attack?</i>

277
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:32,080
<i>Your right, there's no
indication of any terrorism.</i>

278
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,450
<i>We believe these are
simply isolated and</i>

279
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:37,135
<i>unrelated phenomenon, and we expect
things to return to normal very soon.</i>

280
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,914
See? They've already started
playing this shit down.

281
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,649
<i>... maybe due to a
previous unknown viral strain</i>

282
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,667
<i>that leads, to a kind
of mass psychosis.</i>

283
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,671
- Psychosis, who's going to believe that?
- Psychotic?

284
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:52,454
<i>The President continues to monitor
the situation from his ranch and</i>

285
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:55,282
<i>he's asked the American
people to remain vigilant.</i>

286
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:58,747
- Say who you are, Eliot.
- You just did, I'm Eliot.

287
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,009
Tell us more.

288
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,918
Eliot Stone, Harrisburgh PA.

289
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,709
I'm here with you fine people
because, I don't know

290
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:06,887
I'd like to get home, too.

291
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:09,600
It's on the way, I'm hoping you'll
be so kind as to drop me off.

292
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:11,681
Seems like everybody
wants to get home.

293
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:14,468
I know what you're trying
to do, Jason. I get it.

294
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:17,355
Gordo Thorsen.
Denver, Pennsylvania.

295
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:21,205
Tracy Thurman.
We're a...

296
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,380
together.
- Forever.

297
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,566
We'll see.

298
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:27,608
What's that?

299
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,962
Oh... this is
my camera.

300
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:32,454
Smile.

301
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:34,448
Thurman and Gordo.

302
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:36,554
Gimme a kiss.

303
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:40,244
Oh, I'm from San Antone,
that's Texas.

304
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,556
Don't mess with Texas.

305
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,650
Holy shit.
Look at this guy!

306
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:45,926
Christ!

307
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:52,261
He's gotta be doing like
a buck twenty.

308
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:54,714
Professor?

309
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,853
Ah-ha, you finally come to me,
I was beginning to feel rejected.

310
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,130
- It's just that...
- So far away, I know.

311
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:02,732
In storage...

312
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,132
sitting on a toilet seat
with everyone's dirty laundry.

313
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:10,880
Andrew Maxwell,
analyst.

314
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:13,087
Nowhere to go,
nothing to do.

315
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,564
and I'm not
with anybody.

316
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,321
Like Mr. Ravello, I'm just
popping along for the ride.

317
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,138
I'm not with
anyone either.

318
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,585
I'm... just...

319
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,883
here all alone...
just me and Saint Chris.

320
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:29,613
We'll probably be calling on ol' Saint Chris
before this night's over.

321
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:31,591
Oh my god!
Look!

322
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:35,403
We'll never get past that. Turn around.
We should go back to the dorms.

323
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,359
- Look!
- It's a cop.

324
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,571
- He's a State Trooper
- How do you know that?

325
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,760
- His hat is... because his hat.
- He looks hurt.

326
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:47,140
- He's all burned up.
- Not just burned, he's fuckin' fried!

327
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:49,285
Oh my...

328
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,439
He's dead!

329
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,957
I'm telling you, he can't be
anything else but dead.

330
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,691
Oh my god!

331
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:58,220
I think he wants more than
your license and registration!

332
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:02,676
Go! Go!

333
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:05,505
Oh fuck!

334
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Fuck!

335
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,169
Wait, wait, wait!

336
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:13,933
What's that?
What's that?

337
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:39,528
What'll we do?

338
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,113
- What time is it?
- Almost three.

339
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,708
I think we should pull over.

340
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,528
How do you feel?

341
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,133
Mary?

342
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:01,077
How do you feel about
what just happened?

343
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:04,540
- I killed six of them...
- They were already dead, OK?

344
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,561
You didn't anything
wrong.

345
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,619
Listen to me.

346
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,793
Jesus fuckin' Christ... you don't stand up
and walk around when you're dead!

347
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:12,069
Will you shut up?

348
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:14,931
We just killed three
people back there.

349
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,794
Three living, breathing
people like us.

350
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,695
No we didn't.

351
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:22,652
I did.

352
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,134
Shit.

353
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:51,218
We've stopped somewhere...
off the road.

354
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:54,011
God knows where.

355
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,761
You gonna say
something?

356
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:01,287
No, I don't know. Just give
her some time, you know.

357
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,982
I'm running low.

358
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:09,080
If I can make it to the State store
before they all shut their doors forever...

359
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,100
god, that's a
terrible thought.

360
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:15,911
The world where a gentleman
can't buy a bottle of bourbon.

361
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:18,993
Mary?

362
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,743
- Oh god, Mary!
- Mary

363
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,213
What did she do?
- What the fuck did she do?

364
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,594
- Any anyone know she had a gun?
- Why would she do this?

365
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:30,170
Because of what happened?
Those people back there?

366
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,476
It's our fault.

367
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:35,156
We're panicking,
we're turning this into...

368
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:36,875
Into what?

369
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,788
Some that's not.

370
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,702
Some more than this is.
This is all just bullshit!

371
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,172
You keep calling this bullshit,

372
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,879
someone else is
gonna kill them self!

373
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,899
You heard the TV,
Mary heard the TV.

374
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,357
We all should have
stayed at school

375
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,860
instead of driving around
in the middle of nowhere.

376
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,841
knocking down fuckin'
people like bowling pins.

377
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,794
- She's still alive.
- What?!

378
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,821
She's got a pulse!

379
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,243
- Mary!
- Pressure! Pressure!

380
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:05,380
- Looks like everyone's left.
- Yeah, up in a hurry.

381
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:07,296
This is a hospital,
where else is she supposed to go?

382
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,720
Just because we can't see anybody,
doesn't mean no one’s here.

383
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:10,510
Maybe they're hiding?

384
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,112
Yeah, maybe they're hiding
because they think we're dead.

385
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,342
- Hello, we aren't dead!
- Cut it out, Tony.

386
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:18,621
Wait, wait, wait,
where are we going?

387
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,640
You guys look for a doctor,
we're gonna find the ER.

388
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:24,082
Hello!
Is anyone here?

389
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,276
Wait, wait.
I think I heard somebody.

390
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:30,483
It's down here,
come on.

391
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,886
It's just the radio.

392
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,925
Hello?
Is anyone...

393
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:03,594
What?

394
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,832
<i>We're prisoners here.
So far as we can't move.</i>

395
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,987
<i>Stand by!
Stand by!</i>

396
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:18,112
It's complete chaos.

397
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,690
It's complete chaos.

398
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,500
<i>We got them!
We got them!</i>

399
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:26,394
<i>I can't do it.</i>

400
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,748
<i>- Get that son of a bitch!
- We got five of them here!</i>

401
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:31,816
<i>Where are you, sir?</i>

402
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,585
<i>- Got to get them in the head.
- Got to get them in the head.</i>

403
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,626
<i>- Get everyone out of here!
- You've got to get them in the head!</i>

404
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:41,827
I hope this isn't some
sort of mistake?

405
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,634
This is a hospital,
there's nobody here.

406
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,127
Is this for real?

407
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,497
What about Mary?

408
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,486
What if...
she dies?

409
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,740
We're not gonna be able to by just
standing around here.

410
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:06,897
- Fuck! Losing juice.
- Let’s see if we can find some batteries.

411
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:12,697
- There's somebody!
- Excuse me!

412
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:14,407
Excuse me.

413
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:18,568
We've an emergency.
Our friend is hurt and we need help.

414
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,972
Oh my god, what's
wrong with him?

415
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,415
He's dead. That's what
wrong with him..

416
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:25,334
- Get the gun.
- Debby, gun!

417
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:32,128
- Try the head! Try the head!
- Yeah, shoot him in the head!

418
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,180
Shoot him in the head!

419
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,917
- Fuck, the battery's almost dead.
- Yeah, that's not all?

420
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,434
What do you mean?

421
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:41,454
- What is going on?
- Jesus, the nurse.

422
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,744
Dead doctor, dead nurse,
makes sense, doesn't it?

423
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,490
Fuckin' hurry up!
Gordo!

424
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:48,786
It's jammed!

425
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:50,587
- OK, I'm gonna try something.
- What?!

426
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:52,231
Get her attention,
just to try to get her attention!

427
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,687
Come over here!
Hey, come after me!

428
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,383
Careful, Debra.
Careful.

429
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,057
Jesus H!

430
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,244
Jesus Christ.

431
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:07,150
Whoa, whoa, those are hot!
Put it back where you've found them.

432
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:11,997
We've got to get
her a doctor.

433
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,217
Yeah, a live one.

434
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,464
I got it.

435
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:24,958
Let's go.

436
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,180
Don't leave
without me.

437
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,497
What?
You're not coming with us?

438
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:33,239
- I can't, I gotta plug in.
- Leave it, let it charge.

439
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:35,751
I can't, I can't leave
without the camera.

440
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,188
The camera's the
whole thing.

441
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:39,080
Getting help is
the whole thing.

442
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,079
I should be
with them.

443
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:51,173
Maybe I can help.

444
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,048
I can't.
I can't.

445
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,665
Because...

446
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:58,721
I'm fuckin'
locked in.

447
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,646
Some shit, huh?

448
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:07,681
What's wrong with these
fuckin' dead guys.

449
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:11,812
I'm sorry, Mary.

450
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,462
If anything that Tony said,
or I said, or Ted, made you...

451
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:23,358
People you killed were dead.
These people are dead.

452
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:25,284
At least they
look dead.

453
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,172
The way,
things are...

454
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:32,980
who the fuck knows.

455
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:37,307
Mary?

456
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:40,278
Mary?

457
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:46,848
Shit.

458
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:49,757
Guys?

459
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:53,946
Guys, what's happening?

460
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:56,698
Fuck!
God damn it!

461
00:25:58,728 --> 00:25:59,487
Hello?

462
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:02,736
Hello!

463
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,203
I found this in
one of the other rooms.

464
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:13,208
Tell us your name.

465
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,808
Say it!

466
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,109
- Deb, come on.
- Say it!

467
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,636
Gimme a break.
Jason Creed.

468
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:23,164
See how it feels to have a camera
shoved in your face?

469
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,516
to have to answer stupid questions
when people are dying all around you.

470
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:27,829
You see how it feels?

471
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:32,018
Deb, just put the thing down
and tell me what happened.

472
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:33,369
Well, you missed it.

473
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:39,141
If it didn't happen on camera,
it’s like it didn't happen, right?

474
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:43,473
There was a patient
in one of the other rooms.

475
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:48,670
He looked nice, you know,
not dead.

476
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:51,557
But...
he was...

477
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:56,975
he was on top of me
before I saw him.

478
00:26:58,102 --> 00:26:59,427
It was Gordo who shot him.

479
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:05,223
Jesus! Did you...
I mean..

480
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,319
Hurt me?

481
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,726
No.

482
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,506
So who was screaming?

483
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:12,382
Me.

484
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,365
You want me to
show you how?

485
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,416
For the camera?

486
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:17,353
For history?

487
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:22,320
That's enough, Deb.
I got it...

488
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,125
Oh god!

489
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,430
I just shot
another man.

490
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,667
I've killed three men and a woman
in the last half hour.

491
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:44,980
You can't be certain they're dead.

492
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,710
I remember the war.

493
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:51,620
In war time,
killing comes easy.

494
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,468
Especially when you don't
have to do any of it.

495
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,171
There will be always
be people like you.

496
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:02,873
Wanting to document, wanting
to record, some sort of diary.

497
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,307
Me? You're the one who
put the camera in my hands.

498
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,189
You're the one who made
me want to do this.

499
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:09,321
Not this.
This is a diary recording.

500
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:11,956
In war times only the enemy can be marked,
like this son of a bitch...

501
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:13,120
...or that son of a bitch.

502
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:15,524
Then cruelty...

503
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,598
becomes justified.

504
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,930
God! Oh my god,
look at Mary!

505
00:28:22,892 --> 00:28:25,876
- She's... She's dead.
- She's turning.

506
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:27,453
Oh god.

507
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,168
This is much
too much!

508
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,169
Too much.

509
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,560
God, I don't know...

510
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:38,269
Give it to me.

511
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,129
You can't do this,
give me the gun.

512
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,749
Oh man!
Oh my god! Oh my god!

513
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,589
Your stuttering, Mr. Creed.

514
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:01,196
Don't try to speak,
just shoot.

515
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,661
Shoot your picture, shoot for as
long as your hard drive runs out.

516
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:06,687
As long as
you're found.

517
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,030
Take this.

518
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:13,141
It's too easy to use.

519
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,625
Let's get
out of here.

520
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:27,748
<i>It's interesting how quickly we'll
find out what we're capable of becoming.</i>

521
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:33,053
<i>Up until that night,
we had lived predictable lives.</i>

522
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:37,865
<i>Now, we will never be able
to predict what might happen next.</i>

523
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,464
<i>God has changed
the rules on us.</i>

524
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,940
<i>And surprisingly,</i>

525
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,465
<i>we were
playing along.</i>

526
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:49,645
What the?

527
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Jesus, Gordo!
Look out!

528
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,249
What?
What happened?

529
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:07,124
You got that,
huh, Tony?

530
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,107
After I stab them through the
heart, with this freakin' IV pole.

531
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,611
Why don't you
fuckin' die, huh?

532
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:14,578
Fuckin' die.

533
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,210
You got that, Tony, Huh?
You'll probably at least fuckin' understand?

534
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,755
- What happened?
- It hurts. The bite.

535
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:37,383
It hurts.

536
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:44,089
Take this.
It's too easy to use.

537
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,910
Come on Debby, you can
shot better than me.

538
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:50,961
Yeah that's what I thought,
I don't want to become you.

539
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:56,977
<i>There are currently more than 200 million

542
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,526

ahead of what we see happening?</i>

543
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:14,330

00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:20,557
<i>Compelled, like the man said.
Jason was compelled.</i>

546
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,059
<i>I've never seen
him like that before.</i>

547
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,583
<i>What is it? What gets into our heads,

548
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,374
<i>A horrible accident
on the highway.</i>

549

from just driving on.</i>

<i>We don't stop to help,
we stop to look.</i>

552
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,385
First morning since
we've hit the road.

553
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,723
We're here to say goodbye.

554
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:57,749
I don't understand
why he died.

555
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:03,192
It was just a bite. How can someone
die from one little bite?

556
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:05,598
Maybe it's some kind of
poison or something.

557
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,946
Maybe it is a virus.

558
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:09,449
Anyone that gets sick
comes back as one of them.

559
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,046
No, anyone who dies
comes back as one of them.

560
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,597
Thurman and Gordo.

561
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,303
No! No!

562
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,806
Gotta bury him, right?

563
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:24,722
How would you feel,
waking up in six feet of dirt?

564
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:28,475
Can't we just wait?
Can't we, at least just wait and see?

565
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:30,576
Maybe it won't
happen to him.

566
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:33,287
Please, can we
just wait?

567
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:50,036
- Hey guys, we gotta get going. I gotta...
- Get home?

568
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,037
Yeah.

569
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,308
Although after this,
I'm not sure what we're gonna find.

570
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,807
Your folks will be fine, Deb.
They're smart people, like you.

571
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,699
Oh shit.
Look!

572
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,450
Poor Gordo.

573
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:13,918
He just
crapped out.

586
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:02,579
<i>Small towns kinda like ghost towns.

587
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,268
They're anticipating some
sort of Armageddon?

588
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:12,269
<i>Using country roads
we hadn't run into riots or looting.</i>

589
00:34:12,568 --> 00:34:14,872
<i>But we were about to
run into something else.</i>

590
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:16,526
What a piece of shit!

591
00:34:18,162 --> 00:34:21,347
It's alright,
It's alright.

592
00:34:28,494 --> 00:34:30,319
I think it’s the fuel line.

593
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,828
If that's what it is,
I can fix it.

594
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:34,965
- Oh yeah
- Yeah.

595
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,588
I know what I'm doing.
Daddy used to pit crew for Gill Gilbert.

596
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:40,548
- Rumpert?
- Gilbert.

597
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,299
Who the hell
is Gill Gilbert?

598
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,325
We can't stay
out here guys.

599
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:46,357
We have to wait
inside that barn.

600
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,320
I'm going to see
where the others went.

601
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:50,328
You might now want to do that.
There might be...

602
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:52,334
Oh shit!

603
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:55,266
Whoa, whoa, stop, stop!
I don't think he's dead.

604
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:56,774
He might not
be dead!.

605
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,472
- "Who are you?".
- He's asking who we are.

606
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:09,272
"CAN'T HEAR"

607
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,918
Our car broke down,
we need help.

608
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,890
"AMISH
NO CAR"

609
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:23,452
We don't need a car,
we just need just to fix ours.

610
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,729
We need to use your barn.

611
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:32,602
"HURRY"?
Why?

612
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:36,030
Oh shit!

613
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:37,657
- They must have been following us!
- Oh my god.

614
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,385
- Tony, how many bullets you got left?
- Where did he go?

615
00:35:44,828 --> 00:35:45,965
Jesus Christ!

616
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,891
I thought the Amish
were friendly folks!

617
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:51,149
"I'M SAMUEL
HELLO"

618
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:56,364
Yep, cap line's
leaking.

619
00:35:56,382 --> 00:36:02,127
I'm gonna cut the line below the tear
and get it hooked back up to the post.

620
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,852
Thanks.

621
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,430
What is that?
Guys, what's all the screaming?

622
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,107
Birthday party.

623
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:14,927
Where did you
find this?

624
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:18,353
It was in the camera
Deb found in the hospital.

625
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:31,787
That's the guy, the one
in the orange shirt.

626
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:35,547
That's the guy from the hospital,
the one I thought looked nice.

627
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,924
The one Gordo shot.

628
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,199
What's that?

629
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,054
Guys, What that?

630
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,133
They're in the back.
At the back wall.

631
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:51,515
They're out front as well.

632
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,333
What the hell is going on out there?

633
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:58,791
Jesus Christ.

634
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,464
Oh god, there's
plenty of them.

635
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:16,369
"BACK DOOR"

636
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,347
Simply sorry for,
for all the trouble.

637
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:20,555
Hurry in, I wanna
get out of here.

638
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:25,706
Not to apply unnecessary pressure,
but we are all relying on you, darling.

639
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,209
Oh god,
the doors open.

640
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,441
I hear something.

641
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,238
Maybe one of them got in already.

642
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,797
Maybe more than one.

643
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:04,196
<i>- Guys, what's happening?
- We're alright!</i>

644
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,787
We're alright.

645
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:16,463
Almost there.

646
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:19,414
Certainly hope so, darling,
as much as I'd love staying, I wanna go home.

647
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:33,744
Tracy,
I love you!

648
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:38,526
- Alright, open the door!
- Open up, Tony, let's go!

649
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,678
See how many, there are?
Look how many.

650
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:44,877
Come on,
come on.

651
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:46,303
Excuse me gentlemen,
hurry!

652
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:58,396
Oh my god!

653
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,032
We're alright,
we're alright!

654
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,442
- Nothing we can do,
let's go.

655
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,608
They're all going to be all over us.
Let's go

656
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:21,289
<i>It's estimated that if something
doesn't stop the slaughter</i>

657
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,693
<i>in three or four days,
our death rates will quadruple.</i>

658
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,484

661
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:38,267
<i>Now there are 5 times as many,
10 times, a 100 times.</i>

walking.</i>

663

664
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,862
<i>They're monsters.
Monsters who prey on the flesh of the living.</i>

665
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:51,688
<i>We needed supplies...
Gas.</i>

666
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,763
<i>Without gas, we weren't
going anywhere.</i>

667
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:56,109
There might be more
of them around.

668
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,226
- Think we can make it?
- We gotta try.

669
00:39:58,227 --> 00:39:59,860
Get in, fill up, get out fast.

670
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,661
Yes, but what if...

671
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:03,486
Put the gun down!

672
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,697
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't matter who I am.

673
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:07,334
All that matters
is what I got.

674
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:10,123
What he's got is better than
ours, Tony, way better.

675
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:11,124
Damn right.

676
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:14,645
This is an M16 semi-automatic,
with the safety turned off.

677
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,728
and I'm just trying to decide,

678
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:20,129
do I pump two bullets at
your brain, or just one.

679
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,130
Alright.
Cool.

680
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,681
Good choice.

681
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,363
Now who the hell are you all?
Some kind of news people?

682
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:32,714
No, students.
University of Pittsburgh.

683
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:35,721
Damn, now the whole town
is going crazy.

684
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:36,968
Come on!

685
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:40,590
- Come on, where?
- Any place is better than this.

686
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:43,666
Come on! Before we
get our asses shot off!

687
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,092
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

688
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:51,650
<i>Write their names, kick them out,
lock the door, and throw away the keys?</i>

689
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:55,208
<i>We've become hysterical about people
crossing the border into our country.</i>

690
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,460
<i>That's not the problem anymore.</i>

691
00:40:56,461 --> 00:41:02,461
<i>The problem now is, all those strangers
crossing the borders, who can...</i>

692
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:11,367
What the hell's with
that camera anyway?

693
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,618
Home movies.

694
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,369
Who's gonna be
left to watch?

695
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,515
So, what's up with you all?

696
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,525
What the hell you're
doing in my town?

697
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,122
We're trying to get to Stranton.
We need fuel.

698
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:31,855
We were at the pump,
back there at the gas station.

699
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,682
Them pumps are dry.
I've saved up all the gas.

700
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,358
Can we buy some
of what you took?

701
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,361
Buy? If this is keeps up,
money ain't gonna be worth nothing.

702
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:43,202
I'm talking about gas.
Yeah, I'll let you have some.

703
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:46,953
- Enough to get where you're going.
- What's with you all?

704
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,935
- How come you've stuck around?
- Cause we got the power.

705
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:52,936
For the first time in our lives.
We got the power.

706
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,090
Cause everybody else left.

707
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,496
All of us folks have suntans.

708
00:41:58,497 --> 00:42:00,963
They'll be back, right?
The National Guards.

709
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:03,517
Somebody's gotta put all
this shit back together.

710
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:08,316
What National Guard?
Kid, I'm in the National Guard.

711
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:10,093
I know what's coming up,
with nothing together.

712
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,477
That's why I
got all this shit.

713
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:14,268
Anything worth anything
all under one roof.

714
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:15,234
It's called looting.

715
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:18,244
No, ma'am, it's called doing
what you've got to do.

716
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:20,275
Can I get online?

717
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:22,098
Back there.

718
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:25,945
Excuse me.

719
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,655
It's alright,
let them through.

720
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:29,793
Let 'em through!

721
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,753
<i>A reporter was
on the scene,</i>

722
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,992
<i>Here's Homestead's
Chief of Police, Arthur Tacks.</i>

723
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:42,162
<i>This attack was carried out by
a bunch of illegal immigrants.</i>

724
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:45,130
<i>(inaudible)</i>

725
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:48,220
<i>The only time they were dead
was when the white guy shot him.</i>

726
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:50,471
They changed it.
They've re-cut it.

727
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:53,606
<i>The media
was lying to us.</i>

728
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,722
<i>Or the government
was lying to them.</i>

729
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:58,848
<i>They were trying to make it seem
like everything was going to be alright.</i>

730
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:00,992
- What are you doing?
- I just want to shoot us...

731
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:03,547
- while we're editing..
- I want to cover everything.

732
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:08,358
<i>Now I can understand, why Jason
was so anxious to upload his own footage.</i>

733
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:10,475
<i>At the time,
I didn't get it.</i>

734
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:14,462
now look at the angle
from your camera.

735
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,289
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

736
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,598
<i>- Who the hell are you?
- Don't matter who I am.</i>

737
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,330
<i>All that matters
is what I got.</i>

738
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:32,120
- And after that, we drove here.
- Yeah.

739
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:35,390
Sure, it'll be nice to have the surveillance
camera and go from where we drove in.

740
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:37,991
Figured that much,
here!

741
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:41,740
The recording of the security cameras.
Put the 7/11 in here.

742
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:45,107
- I got it all queued up for you.
- You're fuckin' brilliant man.

743
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:45,846
Why thank you.

744
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:47,153
What'd you do. Did you
get up there to record it?

745
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:48,763
It's a wireless system,
pretty sophisticated.

746
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:52,611
So sophisticated that I was easily able
to rip it off right out of the air.

747
00:43:53,612 --> 00:43:54,748
Beautiful.
This is Excellent.

748
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:55,769
So what are
you guys doing?

749
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:01,330
- Editing.
- Editing what?

750
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,342
The stuff we shot.

751
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,347
When you said you
wanted to get online

752
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:08,922
I thought, you wanna get in contact
with your dad or something.

753
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:10,890
No, I just wanted
to upload our shoot.

754
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:11,891
Look!

755
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:14,726
72 thousand hits.

756
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,712
In 8 minutes.

757
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,199
Hey Eliot, can we
have a moment please?

758
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:22,185
Yeah.

759
00:44:25,994 --> 00:44:27,519
Is the camera on?

760
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:28,883
Yeah.

761
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:32,055
If we're gonna have a conversation,
I'm sure you'd like to have it on tape.

762
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:36,672
If it’s not on camera,
it’s like it never happened, right?

763
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:38,307
OK J,
listen to me.

764
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,521
I'm trying to get home
to my family, OK?

765
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:42,252
I'm out there
trying to get home.

766
00:44:42,253 --> 00:44:44,753
and you're in here,
dicking around on your computer..

767
00:44:44,754 --> 00:44:47,062
<i>It was a pretty
one-sided conversation...</i>

768
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:49,129
72 thousand hits.

769
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,494
They're coming in,
from all over the world.

770
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:52,931
They're not getting the
truth from anybody else.

771
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:55,335
All that shit on the news,
is a pack of lies.

772
00:44:55,336 --> 00:44:58,221
72 thousand hits in 8 minutes,
that's unbelievable!

773
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:01,012
- Congratulations, you're famous
- That's not what it's about.

774
00:45:01,013 --> 00:45:03,705
Would you rather have people not
knowing whats going on in the world?

775
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:06,756
We might even be able to save
somebody's fuckin' life here.

776
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:08,324
72 thousand hits.

777
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,171
In another hour, it will be probably be
a million, by tomorrow, who knows..

778
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:15,446
All over the world,
people learning how to survive,

779
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,595
by seeing how we've
managed to survive.

780
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,426
You always know how to
make a good argument, J.

781
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:30,546
Oh my god! Text message
from my little brother.

782
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:32,085
Well, what's it say?

783
00:45:33,049 --> 00:45:35,407
All this time, I've been imagining
the dead in our house

784
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,277
and they're not even home.

785
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:39,064
They went camping four days ago.

786
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:41,687
"Driving home, we're
OK, I hope you are too."

787
00:45:41,688 --> 00:45:44,977
Sent last night: "driving home".
That means, they'll probably meet us there.

788
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:47,862
- I told you they were safe.
- They're on the road, maybe not.

789
00:45:47,863 --> 00:45:50,653
They're not safe,
but they're still alive.

790
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:55,154
Pack your shit,
I'm gonna check on my gas.

791
00:46:04,603 --> 00:46:05,757
<i>Yo! Dude!</i>

792
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,739
<i>Where are you, man?</i>

793
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,760
Ridley, yo back
at ya here.

794
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:13,068
I'm in the middle of fuckin'
nowhere, out here.

795
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,244
<i>How's Deb?</i>

796
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,696
She's OK.
You know, coping.

797
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:22,561
<i>Look here, if you need anything,
like a place to chill or whatever!</i>

798
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:25,355
<i>Get your ass
down here man!</i>

799
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,307
<i>We're having
a blast!</i>

800
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:29,616
<i>Hi J, love you.</i>

801
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:36,209
- What's up?
- I don't know.

802
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:38,712
Something’s going on.

803
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:43,757
One of my men had a
bad heart. He died.

804
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:46,633
The thing is, we don't
know where he went.

805
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:09,578
Oh shit.

806
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,163
Finish the (?),
and lock the door.

807
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:27,464
- I'm gonna get Jason.
- Stay, I'll go.

808
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:30,659
Wait, that thing could
be inside there.

809
00:47:30,705 --> 00:47:32,805
That thing could
be anywhere...

810
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:46,136
Fuck!

811
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,790
$100,000 education, and I can't find
my way out of a fuckin' warehouse!

812
00:47:58,123 --> 00:47:59,566
Exit.

813
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,850
What was that?

814
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:09,224
Fuck!

815
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:12,399
Fuck!

816
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,360
Where the hell
have you been?

817
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:23,174
There's a dead guy
walking around. Let's go.

818
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:25,444
Wait! Say it that again?
I didn't get it.

819
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,235
There is a dead guy walking around.
Now, let's go.

820
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:50,511
It's all clear.

821
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:58,376
Turn that TV off!

822
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:03,098
Alright.

823
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:05,602
Everyone with a heartbeat,

824
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:07,774
Freeze and shut up!

825
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,107
Son of a bitch!
Where are we?

826
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:29,073
Fuck.

827
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:35,808
Fuck me!

828
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:38,656
OK, never again.

829
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,192
That's the door.
Let's go!

830
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,948
Let's go,
careful, OK?

831
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:50,681
Shut the fuck up!

832
00:49:50,766 --> 00:49:52,478
I see him!
I see him over there!

833
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,185
Over here!

834
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:58,223
Over here!

835
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:01,074
Come on, we've got him!

836
00:50:02,706 --> 00:50:06,074
- We've got him!
- Over here!

837
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,731
- Oh shit!
- It's not him.

838
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,504
Son of a bitch!

839
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,035
Fuck off!

840
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:27,962
Don't shoot!
Those barrels are full of gas!

841
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,152
What the hell
is that stuff?

842
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:20,669
That's enough.

843
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:21,601
I need to fill the tank.

844
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,737
Stranton is only
65 miles away.

845
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:27,496
- We need to bring in some weapons.
- Food, canned goods, water.

846
00:51:27,947 --> 00:51:31,170
- And lip gloss?
- The lip gloss, you can have.

847
00:51:31,313 --> 00:51:32,823
- The rest of the shit is ours.
- All of it?

848
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:35,477
Every last can of peas.

849
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:39,871
But, what if we say we're not
leaving till we get what we need?

850
00:51:39,872 --> 00:51:42,222
What would you do?
Kill us?

851
00:51:42,758 --> 00:51:43,758
I'd think about it.

852
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:44,816
But I don't think
you'd do it though.

853
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:46,999
It's easiest just to give us
what we need, isn't it?

854
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:50,550
Cause otherwise, guess what?
You'll gonna have to kill us.

855
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:52,376
- Deb.
- Shut up, J.

856
00:51:52,763 --> 00:51:53,621
You've gonna have
to kill us, because

857
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:56,310
we're not leaving until
we get what we need!

858
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:04,923
OK.

859
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:07,410
Fill her up.

860
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:11,414
Give them
what they want.

861
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:16,429
Come and get 'em.

862
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:18,200
- Is that enough for you?
- Come and get 'em!

863
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:19,519
That will do.

864
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:21,653
Gotta defend yourselves,
you've got to.

865
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:22,722
Because if this
keeps up...

866
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,866
people start to running
out of food, water, gas,

867
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:26,593
they're gonna start
shooting at each other.

868
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:31,629
No, think I've had enough
of this kind of thing.

869
00:52:31,822 --> 00:52:33,347
This I'll like.

870
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:34,984
Now, this I prefer.

871
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,670
seems..

872
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:38,845
friendlier,
somehow.

873
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,078
Hey!

874
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:48,728
I think you're a lot like me.

875
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:51,292
Good luck.

876
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:53,423
Good luck to
you too.

877
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:04,665
What is that?

878
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:05,846
Where's it
coming from?

879
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:07,875
I found her on a message
board on YouTube.

880
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:09,115
<i>Someone listen,</i>

881
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:11,361
<i>We Tokyo.</i>

882
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:16,086
<i>Very bad here.
Very bad Tokyo.</i>

883
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,089
Tokyo. Can you
believe it?

884
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,534
There's hundreds of posts like this
all over the world.

885
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,458
It's got technology.

886
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:32,325
<i>Don't bury dead,
better shoot in head!</i>

887
00:53:33,736 --> 00:53:36,458
<i>Don't bury dead,
better shoot in head!</i>

888
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:39,836
- Damn it!
- Well, plug it in!

889
00:53:40,271 --> 00:53:41,024
I just charged it!

890
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:43,624
It's not the phone,
it's the service

891
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:45,944
The fuckin' service,
is going out!

892
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,856
Nothing?
How can there be nothing?

893
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:57,952
The towers, the relay towers
must be out. Jesus, all of them?

894
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:01,116
Technology is terrific, Eliot.
Except, when it doesn't work!

895
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:02,341
Great.

896
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:06,889
It won't be long before nothing
works, starting nothing at all.

897
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:20,225
<i>The mainstream has vanished,
with all its power and money.</i>

898
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:25,637
<i>Now it was just us,
bloggers, hackers, kids.</i>

899
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:41,225
<i>The more voices there are,
the more spin there is.</i>

900
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,710
<i>The truth becomes that
much harder to find.</i>

901
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:47,254
<i>In the end,
it's all just... noise.</i>

902
00:55:01,023 --> 00:55:03,445
We're in Stranton.
This is Deb's house.

903
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:08,711
- Thought they'd be here by now.
- They're what? Camping, right?

904
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:10,076
And they what?

905
00:55:10,452 --> 00:55:11,735
They used to go to
some place in Virginia.

906
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:12,952
West-Virginia.

907
00:55:13,515 --> 00:55:15,791
You probably beat them here.
Maybe they hit traffic, or something.

908
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:18,265
We didn't hit any traffic,
there is no traffic.

909
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,395
West-Virginia is only
100 miles away.

910
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:23,135
- Yeah, if that’s where they went.
- Yeah.

911
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:29,469
I'm gonna
wait inside.

912
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,666
You guys should head
back on the road.

913
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,880
What?... and just
leave you here?

914
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,919
This where I grew up,
this is where I want to be.

915
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:39,393
You guys all got homes too.
You should get going, get out of here.

916
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,244
Thanks for
bringing me here.

917
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:42,920
Thanks for
everything.

918
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:50,249
- I guess I'll try to call you.
- I'll try to come back for you.

919
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,250
Sorry, J.

920
00:55:51,594 --> 00:55:55,340
Don't be an asshole.
Can't just let her wait here alone.

921
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:59,916
Hey, do you mind, if maybe
I hang out for a while too?

922
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:02,713
Yeah. OK.

923
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:06,517
Me too? I need to pee again.

924
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,587
I can't sit in
here anymore.

925
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:12,084
I wanna meet your little brother,
maybe he has a Playstation.

926
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:15,485
I'd like to meet your father,
maybe he has a bar.

927
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,144
We always hide a key.

928
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:27,876
Shit.

929
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:31,749
Fuck, I don't remember,
if it's 102 or 201.

930
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,304
It's probably wiring in
the single circuit.

931
00:56:38,305 --> 00:56:41,680
- Where's the breaker box?
- In the garage.

932
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:53,866
How you're doing?

933
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:56,496
They're here?

934
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,666
Mom?

935
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,299
Dad!

936
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:02,320
Billie!

937
00:57:02,355 --> 00:57:05,580
Maybe they dropped off their stuff
and went to the neighbors, or something.

938
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:07,789
Maybe there was an evacuation,
like a mandatory evacuation..

939
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,998
- They would have taken their car?
- No, there's buses, right?

940
00:57:09,999 --> 00:57:14,324
Where they evacuate places,
they bring in, like buses and...

941
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:18,739
Fuck!
Deb?

942
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:20,316
What is it?

943
00:57:30,745 --> 00:57:33,241
OK, they must have, like had
an accident or something, right?

944
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,873
Maybe. Maybe they're
at the hospital?

945
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:37,562
I just hope its not a hospital
like we went to...

946
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:38,563
OK.

947
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:42,125
My dad would have been
driving, and...

948
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:45,918
That means my mom would
be in the passenger seat, so...

949
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:47,444
that's my mom's blood.

950
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:49,513
Yeah..

951
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:54,466
and Billie would be in the back,
so that means, Billie is probably OK.

952
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:57,059
- Debra.
- No, I'm sure Billie must be OK.

953
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,460
- Deb!
- What?

954
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:02,293
OK. Listen to me,
You gotta know that this might be bad.

955
00:58:02,294 --> 00:58:06,567
I know. No, I do, I know OK.
Really, let's go inside, come on!

956
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:09,257
OK, but don't think
about your parents.

957
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,466
Don't think about
your little brother.

958
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:14,635
Wanna go in, I want you to
try to find something, OK?

959
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:18,188
- Something like an old dog.
- Yeah, OK, an old dog.

960
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:20,494
OK, What's her name?

961
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,951
- It's not a her, it's a him.
- A him. OK. You got a guy dog.

962
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:26,544
Yes, like Ken.
Like Ken and Barbie.

963
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,045
OK, like Ken, but not Ken.
What is his name?

964
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:30,488
What is his name?

965
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:35,328
Michael.

966
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,408
Like the Archangel.

967
00:58:39,898 --> 00:58:43,450
OK, so we're gonna go in there,
and look for Michael.

968
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,451
OK.

969
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,659
OK.

970
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:52,380
<i>I thought long and hard about
whether to leave this footage in the film.</i>

971
00:58:53,436 --> 00:58:59,100
<i>I decided, in the end,
to show you exactly what happened.</i>

972
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,254
No! Billie!

973
00:59:00,632 --> 00:59:01,439
Out of the way.

974
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,138
Let me through!

975
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,383
Deb!

976
00:59:13,877 --> 00:59:15,177
No!

977
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:25,835
Daddy?

978
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,179
Mommy?

979
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:34,765
Mommy.

980
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:44,377
I think it’s time
we left this place.

981
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,977
<i>By now, we've become part of it,
part of 24/7.</i>

982
00:59:59,978 --> 01:00:02,475
<i>It's strange how,
looking at things,</i>

983
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:05,932
<i>seeing things through a lens,
a glass.</i>

984
01:00:06,508 --> 01:00:09,387
<i>Rose colored or
shaded black.</i>

985
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:10,738
<i>You become immune.</i>

986
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:14,669
<i>You're supposed to be affected,
but you're not.</i>

987
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,567
<i>I used to think it was just you out there,
the viewers, but it's not.</i>

988
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,103
<i>It's us as well.</i>

989
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,639
<i>The shooters.</i>

990
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:26,864
<i>We've become immune too, inoculated.</i>

991
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:31,760
<i>So whatever happens around us,
no matter how horrible it is,</i>

992
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,833
<i>we just wind up
taking it all in stride.</i>

993
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:36,509
<i>Just another day.</i>

994
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,252
<i>Just another death.</i>

995
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:44,866
It's gonna be OK, babe.

996
01:00:46,452 --> 01:00:47,931
Everything will be OK.

997
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:00,559
Hey, do you want
to swap places?

998
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:04,695
I could take the camera
for a while, and you could...

999
01:01:04,696 --> 01:01:07,196
Leave him alone,
Tracey.

1000
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:11,399
He's right where
he wants to be.

1001
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,994
Hey, where did you
learn to use that thing?

1002
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:27,165
Archery squad.

1003
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,926
Targets of course,
that's all we do.

1004
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,078
Life and death.

1005
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,778
I had such
steady hands.

1006
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:41,128
You still do.

1007
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:46,409
Thank you.

1008
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:55,467
Where's your home, professor?
Where was it?

1009
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:59,604
Oxford..
That's where it was, such as it was.

1010
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:03,406
Not really a home,
just a place.

1011
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:10,330
I've never seen
or imagined a home

1012
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:13,813
that I would want to own.

1013
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:18,319
- Sorry
- Not at all.

1014
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:23,157
I'm a...
wandering spirit.

1015
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:28,430
Yeah, he wanders to wherever
there's a bottle of spirits.

1016
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:33,154
Unless...

1017
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,835
- Where're we going Eliot?
- We're going to the right place.

1018
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:40,636
- We talked to Ridley.
- When?

1019
01:02:41,101 --> 01:02:43,694
- At the warehouse online.
- Is he OK?

1020
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:47,341
Yeah, he really sounded great,
he invited us to come.

1021
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:49,972
Philadelphia.
We can make it there before dawn.

1022
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:51,967
Hey, hey, hey!

1023
01:02:52,624 --> 01:02:53,749
Look at this!

1024
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:56,428
It's the guards.

1025
01:02:57,324 --> 01:02:59,245
It's the fuckin' Guards!

1026
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:06,160
Call me crazy, but those guys
don't look dead.

1027
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:09,386
You see? Told you
they'd show up.

1028
01:03:14,805 --> 01:03:15,805
Hi there.

1029
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:20,356
- It's so nice to see you guys.
- Good.

1030
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:26,339
- What's with the camera?
- Just making a movie.

1031
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:27,811
Is that so?

1032
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:36,239
Where did you get all the stuff?

1033
01:03:36,415 --> 01:03:37,472
Friends.

1034
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:41,935
You know, seems to be
a whole lot of folks

1035
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:44,978
getting a whole lot of stuff
from a whole lot of friends.

1036
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:48,961
Can we be friends?

1037
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,070
You wanna turn that off, son?

1038
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:58,294
Turn the fucker off!

1039
01:04:01,388 --> 01:04:02,388
Now!

1040
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:21,363
There’s your fuckin'
National Guard, Tony.

1041
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:27,415
- They stole everything we got.
- Not everything, they left us our weapons..

1042
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:30,891
- Yeah, they have their own...
- They're military men.

1043
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,293
With the world
been what it is

1044
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:34,319
they know we wouldn't
survive without weapons.

1045
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:37,910
They're not murderers,
just thieves.

1046
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,631
With the world being what it is.
I agree with that.

1047
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:43,168
From now on...

1048
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:47,106
Everyone who dies,
is gonna come back.

1049
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:49,821
I mean, think about that.

1050
01:04:50,372 --> 01:04:54,021
Everyone who dies,
unless they get a bullet in the head,

1051
01:04:54,022 --> 01:04:57,747
is gonna come back,
and try to kill somebody else.

1052
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,457
And on, and on, and on.

1053
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:03,858
Forever.

1054
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,629
<i>Get your helmet
cams on.</i>

1055
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,863
<i>See anyone alive,
pull them out.</i>

1056
01:05:14,864 --> 01:05:16,785
<i>(inaudible)</i>

1057
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:19,420
Hey, is anyone
in there?

1058
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:22,177
Anybody home?

1059
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,427
- Hey, hold it!
- Don't go in there!

1060
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:29,128
- Hold it, hold it!
- Are you all right, mister?

1061
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,151
- Take her with you.
- What are you hiding, old man?

1062
01:05:32,152 --> 01:05:33,402
No, please!

1063
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:48,286
Nobody in here.
I don't see anything..

1064
01:05:52,803 --> 01:05:54,053
Son of a bitch!

1065
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:00,820
Over there, behind you!

1066
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,052
You fuckin' dick!

1067
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:14,892
How'd you fuckin' get
to be in here?!

1068
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:16,814
Look what
happened!

1069
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,952
- They were family!
- Kill them!

1070
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:21,190
- They were family!
- Kill the prick!

1071
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:23,538
No, don't shoot!

1072
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:30,068
Don't shoot them
in the head.

1073
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,939
Shoot them
in the heart.

1074
01:06:31,775 --> 01:06:34,981
Let them fuckin'
wake up dead.

1075
01:06:46,588 --> 01:06:50,430
They used to be...
us against us.

1076
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,646
Now, it's us
against them..

1077
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,035
<i>He was right,
us against them.</i>

1078
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:02,676
<i>Except they</i>

1079
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,070
<i>are us.</i>

1080
01:07:15,787 --> 01:07:16,903
We're here!
Here is it!

1081
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:19,603
Wake up, Guys!
Come on, wake up!

1082
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:25,630
Oh man, it's huge!

1083
01:07:25,632 --> 01:07:27,840
Looks like what god
might have built.

1084
01:07:27,841 --> 01:07:30,391
Only if he
had the money.

1085
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:35,814
Ridley made this place
so much like a fortress.

1086
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:40,990
I've never been to a fortress before,
but don't they usually keep the doors locked?

1087
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:45,279
- I told you, he said everything was cool.
- Well, that was yesterday.

1088
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:11,590
Plenty of security.

1089
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,629
There got to be monitors
around here, somewhere.

1090
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,032
Monitors don't do us any good,
while somebody's watching.

1091
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:20,383
Somebody might be watching us.
Right now.

1092
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:22,254
OK, let’s go in.

1093
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:26,639
No, wait, wait, go back.
Step back.

1094
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,690
I wanna cover everything.

1095
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:37,561
OK, ready, come in.

1096
01:08:46,816 --> 01:08:48,641
I can't do this anymore.

1097
01:08:48,737 --> 01:08:51,137
Every time we walk in somewhere,
somebody dies.

1098
01:08:51,138 --> 01:08:52,564
Or somebody already died.

1099
01:08:52,565 --> 01:08:54,789
It's gonna be the same
wherever we go.

1100
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,390
Shut the door.

1101
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:02,227
Ridley?

1102
01:09:03,629 --> 01:09:04,629
Ridley!

1103
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:07,471
Francine?
Hello!

1104
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,766
Hey Max!

1105
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:18,079
Ridley?

1106
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:33,892
This is where the party was.

1107
01:09:33,893 --> 01:09:34,893
Good lord!

1108
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:38,023
Treasures.
Absolute treasures.

1109
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,726
"A Tale of Two Cities."

1110
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:42,747
First edition.

1111
01:09:42,748 --> 01:09:45,746
You have any ideas
how much this is worth?

1112
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:50,227
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.

1113
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:54,927
Ridley! You scared us
half to dead!

1114
01:09:55,028 --> 01:10:00,697
You came! This is great, this is so
fuckin' great to have all you guys here!

1115
01:10:01,754 --> 01:10:03,771
- Where’s Francine?
- Where are your parents?

1116
01:10:05,597 --> 01:10:07,038
Why was the front
door open?

1117
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:08,364
Oh, what that?

1118
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:12,321
I was outside, just came back in.
Must not have shut it behind me.

1119
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:15,447
Stupid. You know me,
I'm stupid.

1120
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:16,518
What's in there?

1121
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:18,685
Panic room.

1122
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:21,929
Wow, what's going on,
why were you in there?

1123
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,195
Just checking the generator,
that's all, everything's fine.

1124
01:10:25,196 --> 01:10:26,829
Even better now,
that you're here.

1125
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:31,826
Guys! Hell, it's such so great
to have you guys here!

1126
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:34,515
You must be
totally burned.

1127
01:10:34,516 --> 01:10:37,013
What can I get for you?
Something to eat? Drink?

1128
01:10:37,014 --> 01:10:40,664
- A cocktail would be lovely.
- The bar is up right over there.

1129
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:43,930
I'll love to get this damn
corset off me now, please.

1130
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:45,706
You know,
what I like?

1131
01:10:45,853 --> 01:10:47,978
A long, hot bath.

1132
01:10:48,282 --> 01:10:51,562
Take a bathroom. We've got six.
Clean towels, shampoo, soap.

1133
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:53,196
Whatever you'll need.
Whatever.

1134
01:10:54,979 --> 01:10:57,320
So, nobody's tried to
break in or anything?

1135
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,109
Nobody around
to break in.

1136
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,224
We're pretty
isolated out here.

1137
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:03,723
Country Club is closer than
the next house, but...

1138
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:07,858
not too many people are interested
in golf or tennis these days.

1139
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:09,184
Where's your stuff?

1140
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:12,237
You must have brought
some stuff with you.

1141
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,819
Dirty clothes.
Bags of them.

1142
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,838
Well, bring it in!
Bring it all in!

1143
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,819
Something tells me, you're
going to be here for a while.

1144
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,020
I'm going to
the Winni.

1145
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,761
I'll come with you, I'd like to grab
that out of the camera.

1146
01:11:22,762 --> 01:11:24,912
X-1's never enough.

1147
01:11:25,934 --> 01:11:26,990
Here, you take
this one.

1148
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,454
I don't know. I don't wanna
make this kind of movie.

1149
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:32,856
I don't want to movie this kind of
movie either, but I can't change the script!

1150
01:11:32,857 --> 01:11:36,221
- Here, see if you can resist.
- I don't want to do this.

1151
01:11:36,222 --> 01:11:39,106
Jason! I don't
want to do this!

1152
01:11:51,894 --> 01:11:53,719
My father shot a rabbit!

1153
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,566
I thought it was in here.

1154
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,580
Tony, you're filming.

1155
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:12,276
I guess Jason was right,
you can't resist.

1156
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:16,290
I'm filming you Ridley, because
you're acting a little weird.

1157
01:12:16,821 --> 01:12:18,468
All that shit, that
has been going on.

1158
01:12:19,177 --> 01:12:20,015
I know.

1159
01:12:21,309 --> 01:12:22,227
I know what's
going on.

1160
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:25,566
I just feel a
little bit tired and...

1161
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,132
felt a little drunk,

1162
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:29,435
That's all.

1163
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:32,563
- Forget the rabbits.
- Ridley.

1164
01:12:32,564 --> 01:12:34,003
(inaudible)

1165
01:12:34,004 --> 01:12:36,596
Father shot two of them. They are
downstairs in one of those big freezers.

1166
01:12:36,597 --> 01:12:39,672
Ridley, can we look for
Francine now?

1167
01:12:40,726 --> 01:12:42,262
She's out back.

1168
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:45,422
With my family
and the staff.

1169
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:48,906
Right, you said that.
Why don't we go see her?

1170
01:12:50,617 --> 01:12:52,592
I don't think we
should do that.

1171
01:12:53,017 --> 01:12:54,650
- Why?
- Well...

1172
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,338
To begin with...

1173
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:59,258
Father's dead.

1174
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:04,731
He was the first one to die, then he did
mother, and then they did the staff.

1175
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:07,420
Brannigan, Brenda, Cook.

1176
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:10,039
Really liked Cook.

1177
01:13:10,493 --> 01:13:12,412
Maybe she ate the rabbit?

1178
01:13:12,413 --> 01:13:14,888
Did somebody
eat Francine?

1179
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:20,040
Did somebody
eat Francine?

1180
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,383
No.

1181
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:23,976
Well..

1182
01:13:25,665 --> 01:13:30,178
Not exactly,
Brannigan bit her on the face.

1183
01:13:31,426 --> 01:13:34,882
I think. I don't know,
it all happened so fast.

1184
01:13:34,883 --> 01:13:37,476
- I think we should get out of here.
- Wait, wait, Ridley!

1185
01:13:37,477 --> 01:13:40,548
- Your saying they're all dead?
- Yes.

1186
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,299
I had to bury them.

1187
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:48,658
Is no one else hungry?

1188
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:56,662
I didn't bury them in the garden,
I'd never dig up mother's roses.

1189
01:13:57,544 --> 01:13:59,044
That's OK, come on

1190
01:13:59,466 --> 01:14:04,141
I had to chop off Cook's hand,
that's why there's so much blood.

1191
01:14:06,668 --> 01:14:07,668
Francine.

1192
01:14:09,547 --> 01:14:10,547
Come on!

1193
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:21,550
- Maybe we should get out of here.
- No, I got to see this.

1194
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:22,551
Guys!

1195
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:40,768
It's a little hard to see.

1196
01:14:41,332 --> 01:14:43,182
Here, I'll turn on the lights.

1197
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:49,494
This is where I've
buried them.

1198
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,368
Sweet Jesus.

1199
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:03,353
- He's gone.
- There was blood on his arms.

1200
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:05,301
I wonder if he
got bitten?

1201
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:49,933
Guys?

1202
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:56,846
Guys?

1203
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:24,462
- Jason! A little help here.
- I'm shooting.

1204
01:16:28,782 --> 01:16:31,182
Oh, Ridley. Can you
give me hand?

1205
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:34,583
Jesus!

1206
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,373
Oh shit.
He's fuckin' dead!

1207
01:16:40,306 --> 01:16:41,306
Oh fuck!

1208
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:47,987
- Jason! A little help here?
- Run! Run, Tracey!

1209
01:16:56,149 --> 01:17:00,074
See? I told you these
things move slow.

1210
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,203
Where the fuck
did they go?

1211
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:09,151
Tracey?

1212
01:17:09,593 --> 01:17:10,593
Tracey!

1213
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:12,993
Tracey!

1214
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:15,394
Oh shit!

1215
01:17:16,218 --> 01:17:18,810
I can’t fuckin'
believe this!

1216
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:21,586
This is like a goddamn
mummy movie!

1217
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:25,825
Jason, put down that stupid
camera and come help me!

1218
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:34,568
Get that Jason?
I hope you're happy, you son of a bitch!

1219
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:39,839
Cut! Cut!

1220
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:45,120
- This isn't a movie, Jason, its real!
- I'm trying to distract it. Cut! Cut!

1221
01:17:52,323 --> 01:17:54,248
Tell him,
I'm from Texas.

1222
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:05,327
Tracey!

1223
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:08,495
Tracey!

1224
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:13,665
I'm leaving you, Jason.
You do the house, I'll do the car.

1225
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:21,171
Francine!

1226
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:23,914
- I don't believe this!
- What, is she nuts?

1227
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:28,540
- Where does she thinks she's going?
- Well, she's not going for Chinese!.

1228
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:31,788
You know what? It's OK..

1229
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:33,204
We still got Ridley's car

1230
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:35,187
there's other cars in the garage,
we can still get out of here.

1231
01:18:35,322 --> 01:18:36,115
No, bad idea.

1232
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,990
Look, Ridley's mother and others are
moping around somewhere, dead or alive.

1233
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:42,041
And there are human
goldfish in the fuckin' pool.

1234
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:45,328
We just spent the last two days on the road.
Did you have a good time?

1235
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,728
- No, but...
- Out there, we're lunch.

1236
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:52,240
In here, there's a steel reinforced panic room,
where we could sit and play Nintendo.

1237
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:54,416
Until this whole
thing blows over.

1238
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:24,506
- It's me.
- Jesus.

1239
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:30,267
- Where's Ridley? Have you seen him?
- Yeah, he's not Ridley anymore.

1240
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,460
He's something else.

1241
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:34,588
Eliot is something
else too, I'm afraid.

1242
01:19:34,589 --> 01:19:35,554
What?!

1243
01:19:35,589 --> 01:19:36,714
All gone.

1244
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:42,077
He died in a tub of water,
with Ridley in his arms.

1245
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:43,043
How do you
know all this?

1246
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:47,743
I saw it on TV, darling. I took my bourbon
and I went in to watch the monitors.

1247
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:49,804
I went into that
panic room, which

1248
01:19:49,912 --> 01:19:52,487
I suggest is the good place
for us all go right now.

1249
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:00,767
Always wanted my
own swashbuckler.

1250
01:20:00,994 --> 01:20:03,875
- Your drunk, Professor?
- Indeed I am.

1251
01:20:03,876 --> 01:20:06,276
The drunkenness
have oddly.

1252
01:20:06,277 --> 01:20:10,788
Regretfully, never twisted my perception
of things I'd rather run with.

1253
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:12,064
Tracey's phone.

1254
01:20:12,325 --> 01:20:13,900
- Let's go.
- No.

1255
01:20:14,437 --> 01:20:15,402
Jason!

1256
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:17,606
We can't just lock ourselves
in the fuckin' room.

1257
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:20,487
- We'll be locking ourselves out the world.
- That's the whole point.

1258
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:23,656
We lock ourselves out the world,
before the world bites us on the ass.

1259
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:27,401
We've got weapons.
We can take care of whatever comes.

1260
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:29,152
We can't go
in there, Deb.

1261
01:20:29,322 --> 01:20:31,242
I'll miss...
I'll miss everything.

1262
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:34,689
God damn it, Jason,
will you stop this?!

1263
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:37,783
Come with us.
Be safe.

1264
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:40,202
Settle, like I'm
trying to do.

1265
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,188
- Settle, for...
- What?

1266
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:44,301
For life.
For survival.

1267
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:47,949
Survival? Who the fuck wants
to survive in a world like this?

1268
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:52,110
All that's left, is to record
what's happening for

1269
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:53,996
whoever remains
when it's over.

1270
01:20:57,169 --> 01:20:58,169
Please.

1271
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:02,880
I don't wanna go in
there without you.

1272
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:10,363
Alright.

1273
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,383
I can't.

1274
01:21:34,906 --> 01:21:35,931
What was that?

1275
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:38,990
Where the hell is he?

1276
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:43,592
Oh no!

1277
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:49,598
Oh god, No!

1278
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:13,808
J...

1279
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,116
Kill me.

1280
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:36,831
No.

1281
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,385
Michael...
the Archangel.

1282
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:03,649
Hi, my name is J.
Jason Creed.

1283
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:07,583
and I have been given the
opportunity, given the gift

1284
01:23:07,678 --> 01:23:12,186
to be able to document the events,
that has suddenly, landed on my lap.

1285
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:15,448
and I just wanted to let you guys
know, the audience know, that...

1286
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,326
I'm gonna do my best, to capture
the truth, with me and my friends.

1287
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,563
Which gonna be no fakeyness,
I'm gonna go after everything...

1288
01:23:21,847 --> 01:23:23,277
really raw, really real,

1289
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:26,767
and I'm going to do the best job I can...

1290
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,069
and I'm really excited,
to be given this opportunity,

1291
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,468
and I'm not
gonna fuck it up.

1292
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:35,305
Yeah..

1293
01:23:37,224 --> 01:23:38,224
Debby?

1294
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:39,663
Debra!

1295
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,020
Debra!

1296
01:23:57,368 --> 01:23:58,368
Deb?

1297
01:24:00,726 --> 01:24:02,644
I'm gonna
finish his movie.

1298
01:24:10,799 --> 01:24:11,899
The movie's off.

1299
01:24:12,717 --> 01:24:13,717
No.

1300
01:24:15,595 --> 01:24:17,495
There's gonna
be more.

1301
01:24:19,623 --> 01:24:21,523
There's gotta
be more.

1302
01:24:29,503 --> 01:24:30,978
Morning approaches.

1303
01:24:31,518 --> 01:24:34,299
Things always look
better in the morning.

1304
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,425
Not to me.

1305
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:40,119
Mornings bring light,
I prefer the darkness.

1306
01:24:41,016 --> 01:24:43,591
It's easier to
hide in the dark.

1307
01:24:43,893 --> 01:24:46,543
You know professor,
they actually get the...

1308
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:53,730
mornings, they show you for what you are,
instead of what you think you are.

1309
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:58,282
In-elegantly phrased, Mr. Ravello,
but accurately put.

1310
01:24:58,283 --> 01:24:59,283
Mornings.

1311
01:25:00,393 --> 01:25:01,447
And mirrors.

1312
01:25:03,462 --> 01:25:05,737
I despise them.

1313
01:25:06,244 --> 01:25:09,430
Mornings and mirrors
only serve to terrify old men.

1314
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:11,108
Hey!

1315
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:12,499
Can you say
that again?

1316
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:13,671
I didn't get that.

1317
01:25:16,507 --> 01:25:17,507
The truth,
darling.

1318
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:19,144
Look at this!

1319
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:42,740
Close the door!

1320
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,822
<i>Jason once said he
thought he could help.</i>

1321
01:25:53,823 --> 01:25:56,373
<i>Maybe even
save some lives.</i>

1322
01:25:56,606 --> 01:26:00,634
<i>This is the last thing he
downloaded before he died.</i>

1323
01:26:00,635 --> 01:26:04,135
<i>A couple of hometown Joes,
who were out shooting targets.</i>

1324
01:26:04,471 --> 01:26:06,293
<i>That day, they
used people.</i>

1325
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:07,719
<i>Dead people.</i>

1326
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:09,778
<i>You know,
just for fun.</i>

1327
01:26:11,187 --> 01:26:14,543
<i>There was one target
different from the rest.</i>

1328
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:18,519
<i>A woman, tied by her
hair to the branch of a tree.</i>

1329
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:21,737
<i>The boys had this one setup
just for kicks.</i>

1330
01:26:21,738 --> 01:26:24,613
<i>They got out their
favorite 12 gauge and...</i>

1331
01:26:27,973 --> 01:26:30,123
<i>Are we worth saving?</i>

1332
01:26:30,756 --> 01:26:32,156
<i>You tell me.</i>
