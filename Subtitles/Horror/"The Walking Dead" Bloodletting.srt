00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:23,006
Well, that's what I think.

180
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,775
Well...

181
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:29,511
We, uh, we haven't
been thorough enough.

182
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:31,681
So, let's look some more.

183
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,829
Why'd I let him come with us?

184
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,998
I should've sent him with Lori.

185
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,467
You know, you start that,

186
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,069
you never get that monkey
off your back.

187
00:13:34,006 --> 00:13:36,709
Little girl goes missing,
you look for her.

188
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,778
Simple.

189
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,547
You said, "call it--
Head back."

190
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,315
Doesn't matter what I said.

191
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,216
Carl got shot because
I wouldn't cut bait.

192
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,017
It should be me in there.

193
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,321
[Chuckling]

194
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:54,859
You've been there,
partner, right?

195
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,028
And you pulled through--
So will he.

196
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,597
Is that why I got
outta that hospital?

197
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:03,032
Found my family for it
to end here, like this?

198
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,469
This kind of
s-sick joke?

199
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:07,871
You stop it.

200
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,440
Just stop.

201
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,878
A little girl goes missing...

202
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:20,449
You look for her--
It's plain and simple.

203
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:26,656
[Door opens] Rick...

204
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,858
He needs blood.
[Carl crying]

205
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,927
You, hold him down.

206
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:35,229
- Dad!
- I got him.

207
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:40,134
[Screams]

208
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,236
Almost there.

209
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,972
[Screams]
Stop-- You're killin' him!

210
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:47,141
Rick, do you want him to live?

211
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,476
[Crying]

212
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:52,379
- He needs blood.
- Do it now!

213
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,886
[Grunting]

214
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:05,191
[Crying stops]

215
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,962
- Wait-wait, hey.

216
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,432
He just passed out.

217
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:26,745
One down...

218
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,547
Five to go.

219
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,651
[Air pumping]

220
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,424
[Air hissing]

221
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:48,497
Pressure's stable.

222
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:53,101
Lori needs to be here.

223
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,836
She doesn't even know
what's goin' on.

224
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,704
I got-I gotta go find her,
bring her back.

225
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,273
- You can't do that.
- She's his mother!

226
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,208
She needs to know
what's happened.

227
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:03,111
Her son's lying here, shot.

228
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:05,747
And he's going to
need more blood.

229
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,615
He can't go more than
50 feet from this bed.

230
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,622
Hey, hey.

231
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:18,058
Come on.
I'm all right.

232
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm all right--
I got him.

233
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,305
He's stable, for now.

234
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:38,911
Lori has to be here, Shane--
She has to know.

235
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,646
Okay, I get that.

236
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,882
I'm gonna handle it...

237
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,151
But you've gotta
handle your end.

238
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,752
- My-my end?

239
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,289
Your end is being here,
for your son.

240
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,726
Even if he didn't need
your blood to suRVive,

241
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,394
there is no way I'd ever
let you walk out that door.

242
00:16:57,495 --> 00:17:00,798
Man, I-I'd break your legs
if you tried.

243
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:03,033
I mean, you know that, right?

244
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,505
If something happened to him
and you weren't here...

245
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:17,914
If-if he slipped away
while you were gone,

246
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:20,382
you would never forgive
yourself for that,

247
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,819
and neither would Lori, man.

248
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,561
You're right.

249
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:36,131
When was I ever wrong?

250
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,633
[Laughs]

251
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:46,406
You know, when...

252
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,610
When you were in that hospital,

253
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:53,714
the one you were never
supposed to leave, man...

254
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,250
You should've seen Lori.

255
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,989
She was like--

256
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,325
The strength of that woman...

257
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:09,629
You can't imagine it.

258
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:13,166
See-see, that's what
you gotta have now.

259
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:16,635
I mean, Carl,
he needs that from you.

260
00:18:16,702 --> 00:18:19,204
So, you wire yourself
tight, my friend.

261
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:22,141
- Hmm?
- You hear?

262
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,876
You've got the hard part.

263
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,511
You just leave the
rest to me, okay?

264
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,680
- All right.
- All right.

265
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,983
[Door opens]

266
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:36,821
He's out of danger
for the moment,

267
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,157
but I need to remove those
remaining fragments.

268
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,658
How?

269
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:42,026
You saw how he was.

270
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:43,828
I know, and that was
the shallowest one.

271
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:46,497
I need to go deeper
to get the others.

272
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:48,666
- Oh, man <i>.</i>
<i>- There's more.</i>

273
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,501
Tell me.

274
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,903
His belly's distended,
his pressure's dropping,

275
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,839
which means there's
internal bleeding.

276
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:58,676
A fragment must have nicked
one of the blood vessels.

277
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:05,214
I have to open him up,
find the bleeder and stitch it.

278
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,383
And he can't move
while I'm in there.

279
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,118
I mean, at all.

280
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,821
If he reacts
the same as before,

281
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:14,557
I'll sever an artery
and he'll be dead in minutes.

282
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:20,729
To even try this,
I have to put him under.

283
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,064
But if I do,

284
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,034
he won't be able
to breathe on his own.

285
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,203
Same bad results.

286
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,342
- What'll it take?
- You need a respirator.

287
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:36,211
What else?
The tube that goes with it,

288
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:39,447
extra surgical supplies,
drapes, sutures.

289
00:19:39,514 --> 00:19:42,083
If you had all that,
you could save him?

290
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,185
If I had all that, I could try.

291
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,022
Nearest hospital went up
in flames a month ago.

292
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,658
The high school.
That's what I was thinkin'.

293
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,861
They set up
a FEMA shelter there.

294
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,795
They would have
everything we need.

295
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,464
Place was overrun
last time I saw it.

296
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:59,099
You couldn't get near it--
Maybe it's better now.

297
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,605
I said, leave the rest to me.

298
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,007
Is it too late
to take that back?

299
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,543
- I hate you goin' alone.
- Come on.

300
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:14,013
Doc, why don't you do me
a list, draw me a map.

301
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:18,718
You won't need a map--
I'll take you there.

302
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,521
- Ain't but five miles.
- Otis, no.

303
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,390
Honey, we don't have
time for guesswork

304
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,358
and I'm responsible.

305
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,725
I ain't gonna sit here
while this fella

306
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:29,928
takes this on alone.

307
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,098
I'll be all right.
Are you sure about this?

308
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,700
Do you even know
what any of the stuff

309
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,368
he's talking about looks like?

310
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,737
- Come to think, no.
- I've been a volunteer EMT.

311
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,406
I do.

312
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,306
Now, we can talk about this
'till next Sunday,

313
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,108
or we could just
go do it real quick.

314
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,976
I'll take right quick.

315
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,945
I should thank you.

316
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,914
Wait 'till that boy of
yours is up and around,

317
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,816
then we'll talk.

318
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,118
I'll gather some things.

319
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,121
Where is she--
Your wife?

320
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,365
We'll lose the light
before too long.

321
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,669
I think we should call it.
Let's head back.

322
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,369
We'll pick it up
again tomorrow?

323
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:16,705
Yeah, we'll find her tomorrow.

00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,007
[Whistles]

325
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,455
Just get what you need
and get out of there.

326
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,723
You stay strong, all right?

327
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,770
That's a fine weapon, Rick.

328
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:52,005
I'll bring it back
in good shape.

329
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,758
Only one I got.

330
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:18,597
Man, this turned into
one strange day.

331
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,000
Didn't it, though?

332
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,282
Let's check on your boy.

333
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,308
Found some more batteries,

334
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:54,246
a bottle of very
trendy pink water,

335
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,617
an excellent new machete,

336
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,652
and I thought Glenn
might like this guitar.

337
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:03,755
Maybe he plays.

338
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,460
No drugs.

339
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:11,997
You?

340
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:15,733
Yeah, ibuprofen and these.

341
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:23,107
What are we doin'?

No, I mean...

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,848
What are we doin'?

345
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,816

they's looking for that
poor girl and we're here.

00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:40,489
Why?

348
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:47,396
'Cause they think
we're the weakest.

- 64.

that makes my situation?

are you talking about?

good-old-boy cowboy sheriffs

355
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:10,818
and a redneck whose brother
cut off his own hand

356
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,221
because I dropped a key.

357
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,456
Who in that scenario you
think is gonna be first

358
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:17,992
to get lynched?

359
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,526
You can't be serious.

360
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:23,229
Am I-- Hey, am I
missing something?

361
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,166
Those cowboys have
done all right by us.

362
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,100
And if I'm not mistaken,

363
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,035
that redneck
went out of his way

364
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:33,073
to save your ass--
More than once.

365
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:35,075
And don't forget about Andrea.

366
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:37,375
Kills her own sister.

367
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,411
She was already dead.

368
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,715
Then wants to blow herself up.

369
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,018
Yeah, she's all there.

370
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,252
She's havin' a tough time.

371
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,553
What is wrong with you?

372
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,123
The whole world's
havin' a tough time.

373
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,390
Damn, man--
Open your eyes.

374
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,226
[Raising voice]
Look where we are--

375
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,661
- Stuck in this mess here!
- Shh!

376
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,602
Let's--
Let's just go.

377
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:09,272
Let's just take the RV.

378
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:10,841
You've gone off the deep end.

379
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,008
I mean it, man.

380
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:16,046
Why are we on the side
of this road like live bait?

381
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:21,051
Let's go, you and me.

382
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,086
Let's go before they get back.

383
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,227
Oh, my God!

384
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,796
You're burnin' up.

385
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:34,797
Give me that.

386
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,899
Come on.

387
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:42,703
Here, take these.

388
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,672
We've got to knock
that fever down.

389
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:56,083
[Muttering]

390
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:59,186
Where the hell are they?

391
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:03,456
How much farther?

392
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:05,092
Not much...

393
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:08,896
Maybe a hundred yards
as the crow flies.

394
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,198
Too bad we're not crows.

395
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,543
Oh...

396
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:28,046
Oh!

397
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:34,286
As the crow flies, my ass.

398
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,222
[Low growl, groaning]

399
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:40,292
[Andrea screaming] Andrea?

400
00:26:42,995 --> 00:26:46,197
[Groaning]
No-no-- Oh, no!

401
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:53,370
[Snarling]

402
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,787
Lori?

403
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:12,856
Lori grimes?

404
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,824
- Whoa!
- I'm Lori.

405
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:16,091
Rick sent me--
You've got to come now.

406
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:17,226
What?

407
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,261
There's been an accident--
Carl's been shot.

408
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:22,464
He's still alive
but you've gotta come now.

409
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,466
Rick needs you--
Just come!

410
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

411
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,169
We don't know this girl.

412
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:28,703
You can't get on that horse.

413
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:30,105
Rick said you had
others on the highway,

414
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,639
that big traffic snarl?

415
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:33,274
- Uh-huh.
- Backtrack to Fairburn road.

416
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,475
Two miles down is our farm.

417
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:37,478
You'll see the mailbox--
Name's Greene-- Hi-yah!

418
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:47,255
[Wheezing]

419
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,389
Shut up.

420
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,803
Shot?

421
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,670
What do ya mean shot?

422
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:07,139
I don't know, Dale.

423
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,407
I wasn't there.

424
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,309
All I know is this chick
rode out of nowhere like Zorro

425
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:11,944
on a horse and took Lori.

426
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,012
You let her?

427
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,613
Climbed down out
of my asshole, man.

428
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,881
Rick sent her.

429
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:17,482
She knew Lori's name
and Carl's.

430
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:19,851
I heard screams--
Was that you?

431
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:21,552
She got attacked by a walker.

432
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,487
It was a close call.

433
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:26,024
Andrea, are you all right?

434
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:35,566
[Door slamming]

435
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:04,292
This place is beautiful.

436
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:09,264
Been in my family 160 years.

437
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:11,066
I can't believe
how serene it is.

438
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:14,235
How untouched...
You're lucky.

439
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:17,037
We weren't
completely unscathed.

440
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:21,609
We lost friends, neighbors.

441
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,212
The epidemic took my wife,

442
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,914
my stepson.

443
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,349
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:30,284
My daughters were spared.

445
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,686
I'm grateful to God for that.

446
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,557
These people here,

447
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,993
all we've got left
is each other.

448
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:42,328
Just hoping we can
ride it out in peace

449
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:44,564
till there's a cure.

450
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,868
We were at the CDC...

451
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:52,270
It's-it's gone now.

452
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:55,040
There is no cure.

453
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:57,710
I don't believe it.

454
00:29:57,844 --> 00:30:01,680
When aids came along,
everyone panicked.

455
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:04,248
One boy in town
came down with it,

456
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,218
and some parents pulled
their children from school,

457
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,320
so they didn't have to
sit in the same room.

458
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:11,589
This is a whole other thing.

459
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,658
That's what
we always say--

460
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,859
"This one's different."

461
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,594
Well, this one is.

462
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:20,597
Mankind's been fightin'
plagues from the start.

463
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:23,500
We get our behinds
kicked for a while,

464
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:25,702
then, we bounce back.

465
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,639
It's nature correcting herself,

466
00:30:28,706 --> 00:30:30,974
restoring some balance.

467
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:35,311
I wish I could believe that.

468
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:43,118
[Hoof-beats galloping]

469
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:23,090
I'm sorry.

470
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:41,773
My baby boy.

471
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:46,044
Baby boy.

472
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,846
It's okay.

473
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,048
Mama's here.

474
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,251
Mama's here.

475
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:55,621
You're gonna be okay.

476
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:57,222
You're gonna be okay.

477
00:31:57,356 --> 00:32:00,225
We're gonna make you okay.

478
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:33,205
Slow... slow.

479
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:34,673
How many transfusions?

480
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:38,310
Two-- Only two.

481
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:40,145
You know he wanted to do
the same for you

482
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,381
when you were in the hospital.

483
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:44,717
I had to talk him out of it.

484
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,066
Thank you.

485
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,208
Okay, so I understand,

486
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:15,479
when Shane gets back
with this other man--

487
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:17,714
- Otis.
- Otis.

488
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:19,750
The idiot who shot my son.

489
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,485
Ma'am, it was an accident.

490
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,886
I'll take that under
advisement later.

491
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:25,988
For now, he's the idiot
who shot our son.

492
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:27,690
Lori, they're doing
everything they can

493
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:28,691
to make it right.

494
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,058
Okay, as soon as they get back

495
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:31,994
you can perform this surgery?

496
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:34,196
I'll certainly do my best.

497
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:37,231
Okay... I mean, you've
done this procedure before?

498
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,934
Well, yes, in a sense.

499
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,969
In a sense?

500
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,137
Honey, we don't have the luxury

501
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,872
of shopping for a surgeon.

502
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,441
No, I understand that.

503
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:49,243
But, I mean, you're
a doctor, right?

504
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,213
Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

505
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,213
A vet.

506
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:55,783
A veteran--
A combat medic?

507
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,419
A veterinarian.

508
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:12,532
And you've done this
surgery before on what?

509
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,067
Cows... pigs?

510
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,236
I-- I have--
I have to sit.

511
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:26,812
Completely in over
your head, aren't you?

512
00:34:26,947 --> 00:34:30,149
Ma'am, aren't we all?

513
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:42,193
Shh-shh-shh!

514
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:54,804
[Whispering]
Okay, let's take a look.

515
00:34:54,873 --> 00:35:01,678
[Groaning, snarling]

516
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,682
You see that big
mobile medical trailer

517
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:09,318
across the way?

518
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:14,456
That's where we gotta get to?

519
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:16,792
Yeah.

520
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:20,996
I won't do it.

521
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,197
We can't just leave.

522
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,799
Carol, the group is split.

523
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,268
We're scattered and weak.

524
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,905
What if she comes back
and we're not here?

525
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,606
It could happen.

526
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,942
If Sophia found her way
back and we were gone,

527
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,043
that would be awful.

528
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:38,445
Okay.

529
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,547
We gotta plan for this.

530
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:43,083
I say tomorrow morning is
soon enough to pull up stakes.

531
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,352
Give us a chance
to rig a big sign,

532
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:47,788
leave her some supplies.

533
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,024
I'll hold here tonight,
stay with the RV.

534
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:52,491
If the RV is stayin', I am too.

535
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:53,893
Thank you.

536
00:35:53,994 --> 00:35:57,964
Thank you both.

537
00:35:58,098 --> 00:36:00,766
I'm in.

538
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,135
Well, if you're all
staying then I'm--

539
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,502
not you, Glenn--
You're going.

540
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,805
Take-take Carol's
cherokee.

541
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,972
Me?

542
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,173
Why is it always me?

543
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:11,143
You have to find this farm,
reconnect with our people

544
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,978
and see what's going on--
But most important,

545
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,846
you have to get
t-dog there.

546
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:16,781
This is not an option.

547
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,117
That cut has gone
from bad to worse.

548
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:22,020
He has a very serious
blood infection.

549
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:23,854
Get him to that farm.

550
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,423
See if they have
any antibiotics.

551
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,960
Because if not,
t-dog will die, no joke.

552
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:40,236
Keep your oily rags
off my brother's motorcycle.

553
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:42,005
Why'd you wait till now
to say anything?

554
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:44,674
Got my brother's stash.

555
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:48,678
Crystal, x--
Don't need that.

556
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:51,147
Got some kick ass painkillers.

557
00:36:53,317 --> 00:36:54,884
Doxycycline.

558
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,651
Not the generic stuff neither.

559
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,320
It's first class.

560
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:01,023
Merle got the clap on occasion.

561
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:14,469
[Soft hissing, snarling]

562
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:40,360
[Door creaking]

563
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:05,450
[Chuckles]

564
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:09,187
[Flares fizzing]

565
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,196
[Murmuring]

566
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:31,640
[Snarling, hissing]

567
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:05,573
[Hissing]

568
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:11,645
Pressure's dropping again.

569
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:14,014
We can't wait much longer.

570
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,416
Take some more--
Whatever he needs.

571
00:39:15,517 --> 00:39:17,718
- Then I'm gonna go.
- Go-- Go where?

572
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:18,719
He said five miles.

573
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:19,952
They should be
long back by now.

574
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:21,787
- Something's gone wrong.
- Are you insane?

575
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:23,055
You're not goin' after them.

576
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,524
Rick, listen to your wife.

577
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:25,625
If they got
into trouble--

578
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:28,461
You're in no condition
to do anything about it.

579
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:29,929
You've given too much blood.

580
00:39:29,997 --> 00:39:31,498
You're barely on your feet.

581
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:33,600
You wouldn't make it
across the yard.

582
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,934
Something happened,
I have to go.

583
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:37,702
No, your place is here.

584
00:39:37,803 --> 00:39:39,771
If Shane said he'll be back,
he'll be back.

585
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:40,772
He's like you that way.

586
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,040
I can't just sit here.

587
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:43,775
That's exactly what you do!

588
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:45,477
If you need to pray or cry

589
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:48,046
or tell God he's cruel,
you go right ahead,

590
00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:50,149
but you're not leavin', Rick.

591
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,883
Carl needs you--
here.

592
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:56,521
[Softly] And I can't
do this by myself.

593
00:39:56,588 --> 00:39:59,790
Not this one.

594
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:02,560
I can't...

595
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,763
I can't.

596
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:15,305
[Rummaging]

597
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:42,863
Oh, here.

598
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:45,567
Endotracheal intubator, baby,

599
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,902
for my new respirator.

600
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:49,637
'Atta boy!

601
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,573
Come on.

602
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:07,020
[Groaning, clanging]

603
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:10,123
- Come on!
- Damn it.

604
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:16,829
Come on--
Stay with me!

[Snarling, grunting]

606
00:41:32,144 --> 00:41:34,279
No-- No-no-no-no!

607
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,954
Come on!

608
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:43,954
No-no-no-no!

609
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:45,256
Come on-- come on.

610
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,090
In here!

611
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:50,894
Okay-okay!

612
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:52,329
Stay back-- stay back!

613

[Rifle clicking]
