00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,698
and wake up to waves crashing
on the beach.

337
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,983
Yeah, well, if I thought
we'd be waking up in the same bed,

338
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,980
- maybe it would give me a thrill.
- My parents still think it's the '50s.

339
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:22,026
Mmm-hmm. Did I mention that I know
some great hotels in the area?

340
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,417
Hey, what happened to you
and your sisters, anyway?

341
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:31,263
You were all so close,
then after Megan disappeared...

342
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:32,940
Could we not talk about that?

343
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:35,741
I keep hoping you'll change your mind.

344
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,977
Can we please just talk about
something else?

345
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,458
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

346
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,859
I think you put this on wrong.

347
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,625
And you definitely put this on wrong.

348
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,941
Let me guess. I put these on wrong, too.

349
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,505
(BOTH GIGGLING)

350
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:36,180
I'm so excited.

351
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,945
- It's so pretty.
- Wow. Look at this place.

352
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,540
You'd almost think nice people lived here.

353
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,856
Hey, be nice.

354
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,505
And there's the devil herself.

355
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,265
Mr. and Mrs. Tappan!
I haven't seen you in forever.

356
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:53,780
Hi, Jessica.

357
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:57,496
Well, well, well, if it isn't the boy
who has taken our little Cassidy away.

358
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,464
She's a big girl.
She can make her own decisions.

359
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:03,415
Careful. Don't you know? Earth and fire
can't break the bonds of Theta Pi.

360
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,498
After all, we're sisters.

361
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,861
Excuse me.

362
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:10,218
So, where is everyone? Chugs?

363
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:11,696
Chugs...

364
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:13,303
Well, you know Chugs.

365
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,903
She's always willing to help out
with a little freshman orientation.

366
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:23,179
You taste like vomit.

367
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:26,420
That's because I threw up before.
But I ate a mint, so you're fine.

368
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,263
Oops! I forgot to wear underwear.

369
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,743
And it's really cold down there.

370
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,178
Maybe you could warm it up for me?

371
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,863
This whole thing's kind of grossing me out.

372
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:49,063
Whatever. Move it, loser.
Not my fault you're gay.

373
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:55,981
This has been the best four years
of our lives.

374
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,020
The best five years for some of us.
Not mentioning any names.

375
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,302
Becky Reed.

376
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,018
We have this luncheon every year

377
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,985
to celebrate the long-lasting ties
of sisterhood.

378
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:09,895
And to remember that our motto,

379
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:15,585
"Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity,"

380
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,783
are truly words that last a lifetime.

381
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:20,541
As you can see by looking
at the east wing of the house,

382
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:22,584
renovations are getting underway.

383
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,622
So the house, like our sisterhood,
will be stronger than ever.

384
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,223
We have our beloved housemother to thank

385
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,820
for all of her hard work
on getting this done.

386
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,386
Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.

387
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:33,696
GIRL: Thank you.

388
00:24:43,227 --> 00:24:44,057
(INAUDIBLE)

389
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:49,301
However, as happy as this day is,
there's still one whom we cannot forget.

390
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,418
One of our sisters is still missing.

391
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:58,057
And we hope and pray
that she will come back to us.

392
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,936
To Megan.

393
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,901
No frigging way.

394
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,615
We love and miss you always.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

397
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:17,497
Well, as you can see, some of us
are still a little overwhelmed by it all.

398
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,739
Okay, who up and faints anymore?

399
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,022
It's okay. I told them it was the heat.

400
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,826
- It was Megan. I know it was her.
- It was her sister, dumbass.

401
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,057
And might I say, you played it real cool.

402
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:38,545
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you, Ellie.

403
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:39,822
How'd she know my name?

404
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:44,026
I'm Maggie. I met you before.
All of you. When I was 15.

405
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,259
Right. You're bigger. You've grown up.

406
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,856
I decided I'm coming to Rosman next year.

407
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,345
I think it's important for my sister.
You know, some closure.

408
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:58,465
And I think it'd be good
for my parents, too, so...

409
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,060
So, how are they doing?

410
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,263
Okay. They couldn't come today.

411
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,738
It's still way too hard.

412
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,860
But I didn't want to miss it.

413
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:10,337
Anyways, I just wanted to come by
and say hello

414
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,704
and let you guys know that I'm gonna be
rushing Theta Pi next year.

415
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,346
I'm gonna be sick.

416
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:19,225
We'd be lucky to have you.

417
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,700
Um, you guys having a party tonight?

418
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:27,098
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
you should totally come.

419
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,942
Wait, no, you're rushing next year
and that violates Greek rules of recruiting.

420
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,667
Well, I won't tell if you guys won't.

421
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:37,547
Well, we have to go.
Sorry about tonight, but I'll tell you what,

422
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,540
I will personally see to your future
as a Theta Pi next year.

423
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,296
- Okay.
- Okay.

424
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,900
- Nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

425
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,183
Friend me on Facebook, I'll totally confirm.

426
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,336
- Bye.
- CLAIRE: Bye.

427
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:53,582
Was it just me,
or was that girl all sorts of creepy.

428
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,782
Can't imagine why.

429
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,619
No way she's getting in with that outfit.

430
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,739
Who is ready to party?

431
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,784
MICKEY: That would be me.
That would be me.

432
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:03,542
That's what I was looking for.

433

- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

- Hi, you.
- Hi.

435
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:08,698
Chugs, your mom? Smoking.

436
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,380
I would definitely have
a sip of that MILF-shake.

437
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,459
- Hey!
- If I wasn't dating you, of course, Claire.

438
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:16,300
Okay, we have two hours
before this place is packed.

439
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,185
I got to get to my shrink. Score some Oxys.

440
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,020
Hey, you think if you blow him,
you can get enough for everyone?

441
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:22,666
- Kyle, excuse me.
- What? I'm serious.

442
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,297
I wish it were that painless. Unfortunately
for me, he's more of an ass man.

443
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:30,464
Okay, you guys, it's on.
Tonight we bring the house down.

444
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:31,537
That we do.

445
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,698
Kyle, can you and Mickey
go get some decorations from the cellar?

446
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:35,539
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Yeah, we can do that.

447
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:36,981
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

448
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,184

MICKEY: Speak for yourself, pretty boy.

Garret? What the fuck is this, Chugs?

It's a joke. It's a really bad joke.

00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,541
This is beyond sick.

459
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:04,981
Okay. Why would Garret do this?

460
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:08,059
I can think of a reason. He's gone psycho
and he wants to kill us all.

Okay, yes, he's sort of

463
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:19,264
lost his way, but I know him, okay? And...

Look, he developed
this weird sense of humor

00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,303
since the accident,
and this is just his way of saying...

from the dead and she wants to kill us.

Ellie, we didn't want to tell you,
but we got a text message earlier

playing a sick joke on us.

- Garret?
- CASSIDY: Yes.

1351
01:32:31,787 --> 01:32:35,621
<i>You can cut me but I won't bleed baby</i>

1352
01:32:35,787 --> 01:32:38,426
<i>'Cause I'm better on my own</i>

1353
01:32:38,587 --> 01:32:42,421
<i>I've got some things
that I do better on my own</i>

1354
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:46,660
<i>I'll show you how
you turn yourself around</i>

1355
01:32:47,307 --> 01:32:51,266
<i>Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency</i>

1356
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:54,735
<i>Turn me black and blue</i>

1357
01:32:55,267 --> 01:32:59,306
<i>Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree</i>

1358
01:32:59,587 --> 01:33:02,659
<i>I gotta break away from you</i>

1359
01:33:05,387 --> 01:33:08,220
<i>Do you remember all we had?</i>

1360
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:12,380
<i>How we loved It all</i>

1361
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:16,339
<i>Such a perfect world</i>

1362
01:33:17,627 --> 01:33:20,699
<i>That we trusted all</i>

1363
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:23,498
<i>Now It's time</i>

1364
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:25,578
<i>To let go</i>

1365
01:33:36,347 --> 01:33:40,181
<i>Baby don't touch me, trust me
Don't touch me</i>

1366
01:33:40,347 --> 01:33:43,180
<i>Baby don't touch me, trust me</i>

1367
01:33:43,347 --> 01:33:47,340
<i>Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency</i>

1368
01:33:48,307 --> 01:33:50,821
<i>Turn me black and blue</i>

1369
01:33:51,347 --> 01:33:55,056
<i>Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree</i>

1370
01:33:55,227 --> 01:33:58,776
<i>I gotta break away from you</i>

1371
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:03,338
<i>Get the hell away from me
It's an emergency</i>

1372
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:06,864
<i>Better on my own
Turn me black and blue</i>

1373
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:11,346
<i>Get the hell away from me
All of my friends agree</i>

1374
01:34:11,707 --> 01:34:14,938
<i>Better on my own
And away from you</i>

1375
01:34:17,347 --> 01:34:19,622
<i>(THIS NIGHT PLAYING)</i>

1376
01:34:23,547 --> 01:34:26,345
<i>Headlights tearing through the fog</i>

1377
01:34:26,507 --> 01:34:29,260
<i>Top down, hear the engine call</i>

1378
01:34:29,427 --> 01:34:32,260
<i>So cold, burning through the black</i>

1379
01:34:32,427 --> 01:34:35,225
<i>Walt up, daddy's coming back</i>

1380
01:34:35,387 --> 01:34:38,140
<i>You're so alone
Back at the door</i>

1381
01:34:38,307 --> 01:34:41,060
<i>I'm coming home
Back at the door</i>

1382
01:34:41,227 --> 01:34:44,060
<i>You need your fix
Back at the door</i>

1383
01:34:44,227 --> 01:34:47,299
<i>Gonna give you more</i>

1384
01:34:47,467 --> 01:34:49,935
<i>Coming down, gonna take you away</i>

1385
01:34:50,107 --> 01:34:52,780
<i>This night won't wait for you</i>

1386
01:34:52,947 --> 01:34:55,700
<i>I'm the one you love, gonna take you away</i>

1387
01:34:55,867 --> 01:34:58,745
<i>This night won't wait for you</i>

1388
01:34:58,907 --> 01:35:04,937
<i>Every time I brake into the light
I glance a moment in your eyes</i>

1389
01:35:05,187 --> 01:35:08,065
<i>I can taste your cries</i>
