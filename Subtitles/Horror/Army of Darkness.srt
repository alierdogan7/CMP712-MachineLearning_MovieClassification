right this time?

723
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:17,436
Well, maybe I didn't say every
single, tiny little syllable, no,

724
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,813
but basically
I said 'em, yeah.

725
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,900
Basically.

726
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:29,198
You know that story about
how you could've been king?

727
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:31,867
I think it's kind of cute.

728
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,453
Yeah.

729
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:45,214
(SCREAMING)

730
01:13:53,347 --> 01:13:54,681
Die!

731
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:12,658
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the store.

732
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:14,868
Who the hell are you?

733
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,578
Name's Ash.

734
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:20,040
Housewares.

735
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,230
I'll swallow your soul.

736
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:44,773
Come get some.

737
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:07,671
<i>ASH: Sure, I could've
stayed in the past.</i>

738
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:11,592
<i>Could've even been king.</i>

739
01:15:13,302 --> 01:15:15,012
<i>But in my own way,</i>

740
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,222
<i>I am king.</i>

741
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:21,018
Hail to the king, baby.
