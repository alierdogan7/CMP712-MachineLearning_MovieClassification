May we see her, Jane?

370
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,473
She's pretty.

371
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,477
So, why are you doing this to her?

372
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,063
Hmm?

373
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,484
Is Evey losing her hair?
Is she sick?

375

378
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,172
You must let us help you. Okay?

379
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,469
Help me? God, no.

380

No one can help me.

They act like I'm invisible.

382

Do you want to see me disappear?

383
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,274
Sure. Weak pulse.

387
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,910

- Do you want to meet Evey?

- She's inside me right now.

It's obvious.
She's aware of your feelings for her,

Silly, frustrated, violent men,

but can't or won't, so they torment you.

Not your body,
but your heart and your feelings.

And they set you on fire
to watch you burn.

Is Joseph that kind of man?

00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,789

- No.

494
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,721
You said there was a fire.

00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:06,392

Evey.

Evey, it's burning!

502
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,095
What do you see, Jane?

503
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,556
Tell us.

504
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,313
We can't get out. We're locked in.

No, no doctor.

514
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:26,180
No doctor.

- Jane!
- KRISSI: Oh, my God!

518
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,320
Did we get it on film?

519
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,989
I think I got it, whatever it is.

520
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,241
And what do we think it was?

521
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,326
Some friggin' exorcist shit.

522
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,829
It's what you always said.

523
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:52,206
She manifested her negative energy.

524
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,292
Whatever it was, it scared
the hell out of me.

525
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,670
You're scared because you can't
explain what you've seen.

526
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:02,508
So your mind falls back
on the stories that scared you as a child.

527
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,677
Evil spirits and such.

528
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,178
How do you explain it?

529
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,222
I'd call it "teleplasm."

530
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,976
- That was teleplasm? Bloody hell.
- Mm-hmm.

531
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,187
The next step is transference.

532
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,358
Once Jane's psychic energy
has found a new home,

533
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,694
we isolate it and get rid of it for good.

534
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,862
What, now?

535
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,574
The psychic floodgates have opened
and we are driving through.

536
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,576
She's hurt, tired.

537
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,871
She needs rest and food.

538
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,707
Even God rested on the seventh day.

539
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:36,250
Hmm.

540
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,376
Interesting.

541
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Krissi?

542

she could manifest whilst unconscious.

What took you so long?

912
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,467
They called themselves "Lilitu."

913
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:43,180
A cult, devoted to an ancient demon
worshipped by the Sumerians

914
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,558
5,000 years before Christianity.

918
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
Evey?

919
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:58,821
Evey Dwyer.

920
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,700
As a child
she exhibited a gift for clairvoyance.

921
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:06,537
Their leader Dr. Heinrich Dwyer
became convinced

922
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,206
that Evey could reincarnate their idol.

923
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,209
On June 6th, 1954,

924
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:15,504
Dr. Dwyer claimed that Evey
had received a message that

925
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,549
the Lilitu should lock themselves
inside this building.

926
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:23,762
A massive fire destroyed the building
that night, killing everyone inside.

927
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:29,059
Sir.

928
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,522

01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,401
who was born with a birthmark, a sigil.

930
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,906
Evey Dwyer for some reason is

931
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,241
a force that possesses Jane Harper.

932
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:45,409
Oh, my God.

933
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,580
Evey's gonna do to us
what she did to the Lilitu.

934
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,001
- (CRYING) She's a...
- A demonic spirit? Hmm?

937
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:03,302
Maybe even old Beelzebub himself.

938
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,931
Do any of these seriously work for you?

939
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,182
They all work.

940
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:09,433
Or...

941
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:11,185
Or what?

942
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,270
The rational explanation.

943
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,065
That Jane somehow found
out about this cult.

944
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,274
When she was four?

945
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,882
She heard it at the breakfast table,

946
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:20,302
her parents read it in a newspaper.

947
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,112
You make anything fit into your hypothesis.

948
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,865
This only strengthens
my hypothesis actually, Harry.

949
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,202
When we ask Jane to go deep
she plucked the name

950
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,788
Evey Dwyer out of
the deepest recesses of her mind.

951
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,873
That is what she is manifesting,

952
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,625
that is what you call her "possession!"

953
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:38,796

You found out about her
or somebody told you about her.
