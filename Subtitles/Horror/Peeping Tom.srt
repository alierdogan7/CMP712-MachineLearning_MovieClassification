00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,976
Oh. Terribly sorry.

170
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,713
- What are these?
- Chemicals.

171
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,719
Oh.

172
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,054
This is, well...
It's so many things, but...

173
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,726
above all, it's so
completely unexpected.

174
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,646
- These all yours?
- Yes.

175
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,480
I mean, did you
do all this?

176
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,247
Mark, tell me
about this room.

177
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,017
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?

178
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,218
- What was he?
- A scientist.

179
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,592
Oh. Then this
equipment was his?

180
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,359
No, l-I sold his
to buy it.

181
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,367
- Sit down.
- Oh!

182
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,927
This all seems so,
well, terribly technical.

183
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,941
If this is where you work,
I can't wait to see what you work at.

184
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,244
Mark?

185
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:54,150
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at
when I interrupted you?

186
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,483
All right.

187
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,305
Helen,

188
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:54,005
this is the first 21st birthday present
I'll ever have given.

189
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,306
And it's the first
I've ever asked for.

190
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,957
Thank you.

191
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,503
Mark, what
a beautiful little boy.

192
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,809
- Who is he?
- Me.

193
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,145
Of course it is.

194
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,881
- Then who took this film?
- [Mark] My father.

195
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,389
What a wonderful idea.

196
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,392
You'll be able to show it
to your own chil...

197
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,123
Oh, you must've had
a bad dream.

198
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,688
What was the light
in your eye?

199
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,065
Camera, I suppose.

200
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,973
Whatever are you after?

201
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,792
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.

202
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:25,727
Mark, what a strange thing
for your father to photograph.

203
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,738
- [Mark] Switch it off?
- [Helen] No.

204
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,105
No.

205
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,248
Again?

206
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,248
Mark, this isn't
some sort of a joke, is it?

207
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,387
No, Helen.

208
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,669
[Screams]
What's that?

209
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:14,317
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.

210
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:18,117
No. No. Please help me
to understand this thing.

211
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,332
[Man's Voice]
That will do, Mark.

212
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:37,205
Dry your eyes
and stop being silly.

213
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,409
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?

214
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,949
That was a lizard,
wasn't it, or a...

215
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,812
A li...

216
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,017
Well, how'd it
get there, Mark?

217
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,289
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?

218
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:03,932
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?

219
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,870
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.

220
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,909
What was your father trying to do
to you, photographing you at night?

221
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,117
You better go.

222
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,230
Mark, what's this?

223
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,709
I'm saying good-bye...

224
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:51,875
to my... mother.

225
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,114
He photographed that?

226
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,179
Yes.

227
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,452
And this:
her funeral.

228
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,962
And this:
her burial.

229
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,398
- And this.
- Who's that?

230
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,766
Her successor.

231
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,829
Successor?

232
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:29,487
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.

233
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,359
She filmed
what comes now.

234
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,327
It's out of focus.

235
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,663
Is that your father?

236
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:48,638
The morning he left
for his honeymoon.

237
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,175
But what's he doing?

238
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,839
Giving me a present.

239
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,849
What is it?

240
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,908
Can't you guess?

241
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,789
The camera.

242
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,706
Switch it off, Mark!

243
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,610
Mark, switch it off!

244
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,081
Let's get out of here.

245
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,093
Mark?

246
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,808
So, he was a scientist?

247
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,868
What kind
of a scientist, Mark?

248
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,245
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?

249
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,910
Mark, what was he trying
to do to you?

250
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,945
Watch me grow up.

251
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,958
He wanted a record
of a growing child,

252
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,655
complete in
every detail,

253
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,198
if such a thing
were possible.

254
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:26,135
And he tried to make it possible
by training a camera on me at all times.

255
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,197
I never knew the whole of my childhood
one moment's privacy.

256
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:34,507
And those lights in your eyes
and that thing.

257
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,911
He was interested
in the reactions...

258
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,917
of the nervous system
to... to fear.

259
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,078
Fear?

260
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,556
Fear.

261
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:56,595
Especially fear in children
and how they react to it.

262
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,263
I think he learned
a lot from me.

263
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,932
I'd wake up
sometimes screaming.

264
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:07,774
He'd be there
taking notes and pictures,

265
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,474
and I'm sure good
came of it...

266
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,880
for some people.

267
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,717
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard
onto a child's bed,

268
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,722
and good comes of it?

269
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,724
[Knock On Door]

270
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,535
Excuse me, but...

271
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,571
Oh, there you are, Helen.

272
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,663
The party looks like breaking up,
and we were wondering if...

273
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,106
Oh, I'm coming.

274
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,009
I wish you'd join us.

275
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,877
Thank you.

277
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,918
have a sweet tooth.

278
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,684
Thank you for my present.

279
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,816
Good night, Mark.

280
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,827
Good night, old boy.

[Man On Phone]
Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this
picture is a commercial proposition,

283
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,080
and that's why I want you
to do it because I know it's
the type of thing you handle.

284
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,886
Look, you know I've talked
to Johnnie already. I've talked
to him, and he's crazy to do it.

285
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,860
These are the figures
you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.

286
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,124
Oh, it's terrific, Mr. Jarvis.
This script is gonna...

287
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,690
- Still behind schedule.
...way back where it belongs.

288
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,702
And you know
that Paramount want it.

289
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,467
Yeah. Paramount want it.
MGM want it. Columbia want it.

290
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,668
- [Jarvis] But is it commercial?
- [Man] Anglo want it.

and just try
to look stunned?

300
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,702

- Not tonight.

who's working late tonight then?

That Indian picture,
The Elephant with Two Tails.

- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.

- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.

Mark!

343
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,934
Well, are you there?

344
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,700
- Well, where are you?
- [Mark] Here, Viv.

345
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,944
Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.

346
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,010
They're working late
on the lot.

347
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,285
I know. They've branched
off this stage.

348
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,385
- We're using their power.
- We must call it off.
They're bound to see us.

349
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:16,195
They might, but they won't
interrupt us while we're filming.

350
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:21,530
- I've put the red light on.
- You've what?

351
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,598
- I've put the red light on. Would you...
- But...

352
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,109
Would you please stand
over there?

353
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,773
But then they'll know
someone's here.

354
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,875
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?

355
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,718
The difference is
a perfect film.

356
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:44,625
I've waited a long time
for this and so have you.

357
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:49,029
- No one must interrupt it.
- We'll be caught.

358
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,297
- What does that matter?
- Oh, matter!

359
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,670
- You stand to lose a job as an extra.
- Extra? Stand-in.

360
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,902
I stand to lose nothing.

361
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,781
The result must be
so perfect...

362
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,512
that the risks don't count.

363
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,885
So perfect...

364
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,083
that even he...

365
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,626
even he would say...

366
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:21,188
- Who's he? Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?

367
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:26,794
- Hmm.
- Oh, he'd say, "Sign on
the dotted line, kiddies.

but bring your own ink."

it's worth it.

It's time to find out,
Viv.

if I warm up?

- They feel alone without it.

- Building us a set.

385

Oh, well. I've stood alone
in front of a studio camera.

frightened, that's all.

That's due to you.

you make me feel at home too.

towards you...

430

the consequences.

- Yes.

But he knows it,
and you don't.

434
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:50,111
And just to kill you
isn't enough for him.

435
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,591

- Stay there, Viv.

what you've thought of.

00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,971
would be one

would be frightening.

- Yes, I think so too.

510
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:24,720
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh. Oh, no.

511
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,757
l... I promise.

512
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,987
Mark, I'm here
for some advice.

513
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:35,555
- F-From me?
- Please.

514
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,069
You see, I work in a public library
in the children's section.

515
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:45,040
I'm telling you that to postpone
admitting what always embarrasses me.

516
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,134
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...

517
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:52,807
I write short stories for
children, but so did Grimm,
Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.

518
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,681
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.

519
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,882
I learned today that
my first book has been accepted
for publication in the spring.

520
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:04,393
- But... But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.

521
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,692
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.

522
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,332
What... Whatever made
you think of that?

523
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,771
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.

524
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,977
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too,
but Mark, this is the problem.

525
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,540
The children who read the book will want
to see the pictures the camera takes,

526
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,019
but the publishers say they're
impossible to photograph,
and they suggest drawings.

527
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,957
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no. Nothing's impossible.

528
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,960
Oh, I was hoping
you'd say that.

529
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,326
There must be photographs,
however difficult to take,

530
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,331
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.

531
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,333
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.

532
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,335
Well, I can't ask you
to do that.

533
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,963
I mean, the publishers
mightn't agree.

534
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,803
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.

535
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,743
There are some things
which I...

536
00:51:55,812 --> 00:52:01,216
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

537
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,117
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?

538
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,155
- When, please?
- That's up to you.

539
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,157
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.

540
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,388
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.

541
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,295
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.

542
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,596
Thank you for listening...

543
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,104
and for my present.

544
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,675
- Good night.
- Good night.

545
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,687
[Ringing]

546
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:57,132
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes. I'd like to see that one.

547
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,141
Certainly, Madam.

548
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:08,445
No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

549
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,578
We must have some comedy
in this scene.

550
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,648
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.

551
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,455
The thing about this scene is
I must have some comedy in it.

552
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,894
Now you do understand, darling,
don't you? You see,

553
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,798
that instead of taking the first trunk,
I want you to ask to see a red one.

554
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,836
And when he brings that,
I want you to look around...

555
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,030
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- [Woman] Sorry.

556
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,370
for a white one,
then when he brings the white one,

557
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:37,846
then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.

558
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,542
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one
by one, getting more and more fed up.

559
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,551
- [Michael] I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.

560
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,247
Then we'll end up on some sort of
a gag I'll think of in a minute.

561
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:49,122
- Understand? What?
- I don't feel it.

562
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:53,322
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!

563
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,365
- All right. Positions, everybody.
- [Man] Anyone seen Viv?

564
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,766
- [Director] Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.

565
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,805
- [Director]
No, Phil. I want to run it first.
- [Man] All right, quiet.

566
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,840
[Director]
All right. Ready? Action.

567
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,877
- [Michael] Here we are, Madam.
- [Diane]
Oh, I'd like to see one in red.

568
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,276
Certainly, Madam.

569
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,282
[Director Muttering]

570
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,181
Do you remember
doing it?

571
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:23,022
Right. Ready for you,
and back you go.

572
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,756
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?

573
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,822
Certainly, Madam.

574
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,163
[Director]
There's a white one there behind you.

575
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,635
Right here. Again.

576
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,406
Good, Michael.
Excellent.

577
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,968
All right.
Back again.

578
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,642
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.

579
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,287
[Director]
That's it, and back you go.

580
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,482
[Continues, Indistinct]

581
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:59,426
That's it. Just take what you can
without overdoing it.

582
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,363
Play it lightly, Michael.

583
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:09,371
Right. When it's in position,
keep it tight, enter him there.

584
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,430
Very good.

585
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,947
[Screams]

586
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,644
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.

587
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,653
[Bell Ringing]

588
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,787
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?

589
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,852
Um, we pass my place
at the end of the bypass.

590
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,057
Do you mind if I
drop in for a moment?

591
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,999
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.

592
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,401
- If the nipper finds out
where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.

593
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,598
Anything to help
the sergeant.

594
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:48,007
It's about time the sergeant
helped me. We're not getting
anywhere with this Soho murder.

595
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,275
Well, what about that chap
the landlady passed on the stairs?

596
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,283
She couldn't describe him except
to say that he was carrying
something she couldn't see.

597
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,788
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been
on the force 30 years,

598
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,690
and I've never seen such fear
on anyone's face as on this girl's.

599
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,562
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming
at her with a sharp weapon.

600
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,260
Mmm. I'm familiar with
that kind of terror.

601
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,896
This is something new to me.
But what?

602
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,610
That's the one, sir.

603
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,088
- Chief, the expression. It's exactly...
- I know.

604
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,185
Don't say anything.

605
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,438
Well, sir, we shall probably
have to interview everyone,

606
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:55,000
so we better plan a campaign
that won't interfere too much
with your productions.

607
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:59,947
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even
a single day's delay could cost.

608
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,315
Oh, uh, we do, sir.

609
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,081
- Hello, Mark.
- [Mark] Hello.

610
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,428
- Hey, I don't think
you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.

611
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:21,402
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.

612
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,305
Gerry, you're next. Don't look
so scared. They can't eat you.

613
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:29,038
Looks as though it's going
to be an early night tonight.

614
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,240
- I've been watching you.
- Oh.

615
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:35,648
- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.

616
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,312
I have a few quite
interesting shots of them.

617
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,757
- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?

618
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,454
To photograph
an investigation...

619
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,463
or as much of it
as I can get.

620
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,465
What on Earth for?

621
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,730
It will complete
a documentary.

622
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,203
- Documentary, huh? What's it about?
- Mmm.

623
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,467
- Hmm?
- What's it about?

624
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,442
I'd rather not tell you
till it's finished,

625
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,445
and it will be soon.

626
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:07,074
- Suppose they catch you?
- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.

627
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,778
- Don't you mind?
- No.

628
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,414
- Mark, are you crazy?
- Yes.

629
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,481
Do you think
they'll notice?

630
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:19,551
- [Woman] Mark, you're next.
- Don't get into trouble
for heaven's sake.

631
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,621
I want to discuss
that film at the Everyman.

632
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,725
Oh, yes, I'd like that.

633
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,005
- [Knock On Door]
- Come in!

634
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:37,910
Mr. Lewis?
Ah, my photographer.

635
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:42,611
I brought you the camera in case
you wanted to take the film away.

636
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,789
- Chief?
- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.

637
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:53,090
As long as we don't appear at the local
next week in place of the cartoon.

638
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:56,325
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg.
This is Sergeant Miller.

639
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,697
Grab a chair.

640
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:04,203
Well, now, have you
anything to tell us?

641
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,742
- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?

642
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,642
- Yes, sir.
- How well?

643
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,648
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:19,211
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.

645
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:24,625
- Did you speak to her?
- I called out good night.

646
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,527
Don't know if she heard me.

647
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:33,959
- What'd you do then?
- Oh, taking some shots.

648
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,006
I'm making a film.

649
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:41,032
- Oh? Where?
- Oh, all over the place.

650
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,044
It's a documentary.

651
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:46,240
Mm-hmm.
Anyone with you?

652
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,877
No, sir. Just my...
Just my camera.

653
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,444
[Ringing]

654
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,189
Sergeant Miller.

655
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,752
Right.
I'll tell 'im.

656
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,095
The doctor's finished
his examination,

657
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,101
and he wants
to see you.

658
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,798
- Right. You'd better go on first.
- Right, sir.

659
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,639
Got ya.

660
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,647
- Nice job.
- Thank you, sir.

661
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,219
What time did you arrive home
last night, Mr. Lewis?

662
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,783
About 10:00, 10:30.

663
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:35,763
- Anyone see you?
- Yes. The people who live downstairs.

664
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,392
I see.

665
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,165
Right. That's all.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

666
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,172
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

667
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,609
Wait a minute!

- Good evening, Mark.
- How did you...

The young man bathing himself
brought me to your door.

of the adventure alone.

allowed keys.

- A talk.

- Next door would be more...

in the rooms they live under.

Every night you switch on
that film machine.

01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:37,798
What are these films
you can't wait to look at?

828
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,075
What's the film
you're showing now?

829
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,777
Why don't you
lie to me?

- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.

It's no good.

836
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,814
I was afraid
it wouldn't be.

837
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:29,517
- What?
- The lights fade too soon.

838
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:35,561
- They always do.
- L...

839
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,930
I have to try again.

840
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,406
What do you think
you've spoiled?

841
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,772
Opportunity.

842
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,869
Now I have to find
another one.

843
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,947
What are you doing?

844
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,957
Mark?

845
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,361
Where are you?

846
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,431
Where are you?

847
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,628
Why are you putting
that light on my face?

848
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,573
Mark?

849
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:28,577
- [Film Rolling]
- Please let me finish.

850
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,584
It's for Helen.

851
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:35,555
What do you mean,
"It's for Helen"?

852
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,491
She wanted to see
something I photographed.

853
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,994
My daughter sees enough
of my face without photographs.

854
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:45,523
Please, don't-
don't be frightened.

855
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:49,571
Not frightened.
Hot.

856
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,506
So put that
camera away!

857
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,391
Yes.

858
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,965
In rather a hurry,
aren't you?

859
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,566
Must be tired.

860
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,840
It's late.
You...

861
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:35,713
You're anxious to get rid
of me all of a sudden.

862
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,781
l-I won't be selfish.

863
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,553
You-You can take some more pictures,
if you want to.

864
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,560
No, thank you.

865
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,858
Why not?

866
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,058
I ran out of film.

867
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:55,535
Can't you find some more
to please Helen?

868
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:58,164
No. No.

869
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,740
You... You don't
trust yourself...

870
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,744
to take any more,
do you?

871
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,678
Instinct's a wonderful thing,
isn't it, Mark?

872
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,411
A pity it
can't be photographed.

873
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,925
If I'd listened to it
years ago, l...

874
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,554
I might have
kept my sight.

875
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:26,960
I wouldn't have let a man
operate I had no faith in.

876
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:30,436
So, I'm listening
to my instinct now.

877
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:40,909
And it says all this
filming isn't healthy,

878
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,644
and that
you need help.

879
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,880
Get it, Mark.

880
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,354
Get it quickly.

881
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:52,154
And until you do, I don't want you
and Helen to see each other.

882
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,161
I will never photograph her,
I promise you.

883
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:58,222
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.

884
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,935
And if you don't
listen to me,

885
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:05,768
one of us will move
from this house.

886
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,572
It would be a pity, because we'll
never find a cheaper place.

887
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:14,104
You'll never have to move because of me.
l... I promise.

888
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,825
Good boy.

889
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:36,033
The stairs are
the difficult part.

890
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,211
That's far enough.
Thank you.

891
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,474
Taking my picture?

892
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,140
Yes.

893
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,976
It's a long time
since anyone did.

894
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,918
Mark, what's
troubling you?

895
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,787
Good night,
Mrs. Stephens.

896
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,259
You'll have
to tell someone.

897
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,223
You'll have to!

01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,555
Now over here.
Swing over on me. Good.

901
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:13,396
All right. Here we go. First positions,
everybody. Absolute quiet.

902
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:17,097
- Ready to turn, Phil?
- [Phil] Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

[Indistinct Chatter]

904
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,708
Hey! That sneezer geezer's
a psychiatrist.

905
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:25,143
Heard it
on the grapevine.

906
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:28,114
[Man] All right, boys and girls.
First positions, everybody.

907
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:31,949
Now, take it easy, and I know you'll be
absolutely wonderful, darling.

908
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,284
- It's simply just...
Do you mind standing...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

909
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,290
- Who is this, Alex?
- It's the detective, sir.

910
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:40,522
Oh-Oh, yes. Of course it is. Everybody's
here just to help you, darling.

911
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:44,190
Now, take it easy.
It's exactly the same as it was before,

912
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,257
only one or two
slight changes.

913
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,768
This time it's hats
instead of...

01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,976

You know.
- [Michael] Yes, sir.

917
01:21:56,044 --> 01:22:00,743
Now, darling, be very brave. You're
wonderful, and we shall all be with you.

918
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:05,047
- Just as... Oh, please!
- All right. Clear the set!
Please, makeup.

919
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,782
- Now, take it easy, darling. Just relax.
- All right.

920
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:12,352
All right.
And camera!

921
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,622
Hat, madam?

922
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,823
Yes. L-I'd like
to see that one.

923
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:18,832
Certainly, madam.

924
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,138
Thank you.

925
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,140
Oh.

01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,836
Uh, have you
one in red?

01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,845
Certainly, madam.

928
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:39,347
In red? In red?
Have you one in blue?

929
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,719
In blue. In blue.

Ye gods!

931
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:49,491
- Break for half an hour, sir?
- No. Break forever!

932
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:52,829
All right, boys and girls.
Break it up. Back in half an hour.

01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,910
Yes.

935
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,175
- Could you, uh, suggest something?
- Oh, it's jolly interesting.

936
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,545
No. I mean to help her...
psychologically.

937
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,949
Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.

- Hmm?

943
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:37,542
I wonder if you knew
my father, Professor Lewis?

944
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,546
- A...
- A. N. Lewis.

945
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,708
Oh, of course
I knew him.

946
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,718
He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.

947
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:47,721
Brilliant!
Quite brilliant!

948
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,486
Do you know what he was interested in...
before he died?

949
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:53,493
No. Tell me.
Tell me.

950
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,456
l-I don't remember
what he called it,

951
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:04,494
but it has something
to do with what...

952
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:08,269
what causes people
to be Peeping Toms.

953
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:12,837
Scoptophilia, that would interest him.
Most fertile mind.

954
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:18,011
- Scopto...
- Philia. The morbid urge to gaze.

955
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:21,544
Coined since his day. Now tell me,
are there any of his manuscripts left?

956
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,716
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually. Yeah.

957
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,919
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.

958
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:29,862
The cure. Oh, very quick. A couple
of years' analysis three times a week,

959
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,094
an hour a time
and soon it's uprooted.

960
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,362
Now, are there any
of his papers left?

961
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:39,066
I should be most grateful
if I could see them.

962
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,404
l-I'll give you
my address.

963

Yes, Doctor.

01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:56,613
- I wonder what all that's about?
- I don't know.

965
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,625
We'll find out afterwards.

Hey, Mark.

968
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:24,744
Can't wait
to show you this.

969
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,844
I should charge ya.

970
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,788
You don't get that
in Sight and Sound.

971
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,985
Oh, she's terrific.

972
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,256
I got some more,
if you're interested.

973
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:40,427
You've given me...
an idea.

974
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:44,097
Hey, I'll bet
I have.

975
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:46,640
He asked me if I knew his father,
which I did.

976
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,268
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?

977
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:53,007
I think so. Oh, we had
a little chat about scoptophilia.

978
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:55,811
- And he's going to... Voyeurism.
- About what?

979
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:59,251
- Eh?
- What makes people into Peeping Toms,

980
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,948
one of his father's
subjects, and...

981
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,957
Peeping Tom?

982
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:07,017
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.

983
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,791
You don't suspect him,
do you?

984
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,991
I suspect them all.

985
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,557
- [Director] Action!
- What about you?

986
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:18,094
I'm interested in this fantastic
extrovert who brought the girl in.

987
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,198
There's something
on his mind.

988
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:23,301
No wonder.
He's the director.

989
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:26,074
Can't manage Saturday, sir.

990
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:30,584
But... But they're
letting us off early today.

991
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:34,520
This afternoon after work...
might be my only chance.

992
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:37,387
Well, uh, be here
at 6:00, Mark.

993
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,392
I'll have Milly waiting.

994
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,827
- 6:00?
- On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.

995
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,457
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.

996
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,400
- The last shot of the day.
Make it a good one.
- Okay.

997
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,630
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

998
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,765
I want to see how some of them
spend their spare time.

999
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:56,901
- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.

1000
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:04,435
- Oh, there you are.
Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.

1001
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:06,673
- Milly's upstairs.
- Thank you, sir.

1002
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,841

- And I had a date with my new boyfriend.
- Sorry, Milly.

I may not be here tomorrow.

I might as well
talk to a zombie.

Is it safe to be alone
with you, I wonder?

Oh, by the way, your mother
was yelling out before you came in.

Something about Mark
photographing her.

For private photography,

Shall I hang around

No. I don't
think so either.
