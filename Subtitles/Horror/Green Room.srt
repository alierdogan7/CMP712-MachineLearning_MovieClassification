1
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,117
-Pat:
Shit.

2
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,624
Sam.

3
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,293
Pat: Sam, wake up.

4
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,594
-What's wrong?

5
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,331
- Fuck.

6
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,167
-What'd you do, tiger?

7
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:11,537
-When did we crash?
-Sam: You tell us, asshole.

8
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,106
-I guess I fell asleep.

9
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,140
-Yeah...

10
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,009
With the engine running.

11
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,580
-Fully charged.

12
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,748
Did you kill the battery too?

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,450
-You hear the radio?

14
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,025
-There's a skating rink
about 11 miles from here.

15
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,526
Big parking lot.

16
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,362
-Ice skating
or rollerskating?

17
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,464
-Just says they're open.

18
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,398
Why?

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,266
-Reece:
Hockey players whoop more ass.

20
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,635
-I don't know, dude.
I've seen some pretty
bad-ass roller skaters.

21
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,304
At 7:00 am?

22
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,573
All right,
I'll come with.

23
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,443
-Sam?
-Sam: Tad.

24
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:31,443
-Tad:
Awesome.

25
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,713
Hey, I work nights,
but I'll catch up
with you guys for breakfast.

26
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,915
-Okay.
-I'm in 2-r up the stairs.

27
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,585
Just crash wherever.
Uh, park in the side lot.

28
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,553
Rear doors tight to the walls
so no one steals your shit.

29
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,788
-All right.

30
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,456
Yeah?

31
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,209
-Sam:
These all have mushrooms.

32
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,611
-This dude's legit.

33
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,880
-Reece:
Why? 'Cause he wakes up
at 5:00 in the morning

34
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,482
to put jizz in his hair?

35
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,717
-Tiger:
Mm...

36
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,785
No. He's true.

37
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,392
-Ree-ree.

38
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,563
Who you callin'?

39
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,198
-Is that your business?

40
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,733
-I get the bills.

41
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,534
-I'm going to bed.

42
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,270
-We're gonna drink.

43
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,464
Mornin'.

44
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,433
-Hello.

45
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,068
You were the first
to fall asleep?

46
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,349
-Okay, I'm with the ain't rights
from Washington, D.C.

47
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,950
-Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.

48
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,587
-Tad:
Nice. Uh, and this is
for seaside hcfm.

49
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,822
-Not for the zine?

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,457
-Tad: I'll do
a print version for that,

51
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,259
but this will run
on our college station.

52
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,360
Uh, if that's cool.

53
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,328
-Sam:
Yeah.

54
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,963
-So, you guys working
on anything new?

55
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,498
-Sam:
Mm, yeah. A few songs.

56
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,367
Maybe enough for,
like, a seven inch.

57
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,968
-Tad:
Sweet. Will you
actually press one?

58
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,437
-Yeah, if we can afford it.

59
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,339
-Tad:
Yeah, no, I really dig
the analog style.

60
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,707
Uh, which brings
me to the fact

61
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,375
you guys are hard to find.

62
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,043
Why no social media presence?

63
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,479
-Reece:
That's because
booking more shows,

64
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,381
selling more records
would blow.

65
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,515
-It's not hard rock.

66
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,918
-No one wants to starve, but...

67
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,889
When you take it all virtual,
you lose...

68
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,725
The texture.

69
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:03,395
-What do you mean "texture"?
-Just... you gotta be there.

70
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,931
The music is for effect.

71
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,800
It's time and aggression...

72
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,302
-Technical wizardry.

73
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,437
-And it's shared live...

74
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,806
And then it's over.

75
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,677
The energy can't last.

76
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,445
-Unless you're iggy pop.

77
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,013
-Yeah, well good for him,
but I don't think I wanna

78
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,883
be in my 70's still listening
to minor threat.

79
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,319
-But tiger does.
-I won't live to be 70, so...

80
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,021
-Okay, so, uh,
this is a good seg

81
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,356
into one of my traditions.

82
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,326
Uh, for each of you,
name your desert island band.

83
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,861
-Only one?

84
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,964
-Reece:
If I were to
say black sabbath,

85
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,366
would I get
ozzy and dio?

86
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,735
-No caveats.
Just name the band.

87
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,836
-Okay.

88
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,639
-Misfits.

89
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,374
No, the damned.

90
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,876
-Um...
-Tiger: Oh, fuck it. Misfits.

91
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,811
-Sam: Poison idea.
-Cro-mags.

92
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,479
-Tad:
That's a good one also.

93
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,981
-Reece:
Why don't you say
something, dude?

94
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,450
-Tiger:
What about steely Dan?

95
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,919
-Hm. No, candlebox.
-He's a juggalo.

96
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,689
-Uh... uh...
-Tiger: Britney Spears?

97
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,426
-Hey-- hey, you--
you-- you're gonna

98
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,127
edit this, right?
-I can chop it up a bit.

99
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,130
-Tiger: Oh, you should
let it go raw, man.
-Um, when is this gonna air?

100
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,999
Like, maybe we should
plug the show?

101
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,134
-Yeah. Um...

102
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,573
My last show
at the muni center
didn't end well.

103
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:25,444
Uh, lots of vomit,
some fecal matter.

104
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,679
County commissioner got wind
and pulled my permit.

105
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,081
You guys were
already en route.

106
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,451
-No, you gotta
give us a kill fee.

107
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,720
-We went 90 miles
out of our way.
-I've got a backup lined up.

108
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,923
Um, lunch,
50% cut on the door,

109
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,591
and you guys would headline.

110
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,427
-Is anyone still on the bill?

111
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,695
-No.

112
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,263
Turn that shit off.

113
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,438
-I gave you my cut.

114
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,806
Uh, the house got theirs,
but I didn't--

115
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,941
-split four ways,
it's six bucks each.

116
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,710
-$6.87.

117
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,612
.88 if you just round up...

118
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,047
You dip-shit, fashion punk
clown motherfucker.

119
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,049
-Christ.
-Now easy there, jiu-jitsu.

120
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,285
-Yeah. We don't wanna
go to jail, too.

121
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,222
I think you just
ended this tour.
-Fuck yes. Let's call it.

122
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,026
-Sam:
All right, so we'd
have to beeline to DC.

123
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,461
We have enough
for one tank.

124
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,762
We'd have to siphon
the rest of the way.

125
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,763
-Reece:
That's not a problem.

126
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,665
We got rice and beans.

127
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,167
-We can head up north.
Take the 80 all the way.

128
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,669
-What the fuck
you doing, man?

129
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,771
-Let me call my cousin.

130
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,206
I can get you guys
a solid gig.

131
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,741
-Where? Here?

132
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,775
-Scene is dead.

133
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,610
You'd have to dip
down closer to Portland.

134
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,752
-Tiger:
I say we just gank his vinyl.

135
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,790
-All right, so all set.

136
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,926
Uh, matinée tomorrow.

137
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,827
Door's at 1:00,
you guys are on at 3:00.

138
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,663
I texted the addy.
-Sam: How much?

139
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,064
-Uh, $350.

140
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,566
Minus your tab.

141
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,036
And, um, just so you know,
it's mostly boots
and braces down there.

142
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,537
-Skins? There's some
at every show.

143
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,272
-What? D.M.S.? Sharp?

144
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,741
-Uh, right-wing,
or technically ultra-left,

145
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,276
but not affiliated.

146
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,745
-And your cousin's cool?
-Tad: Yeah, yeah.

147
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,081
Uh, don't talk politics,
but stick with Daniel.

148
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,584
-I'd tag along,
but he and his girl are
coming here to crash.

149
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,618
Gotta vacuum and shit.

150
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,720
-So they're not,
like, burning crosses

151
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,722
or anything, right?
Like, we just play rock?

152
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,557
-Uh, I'd play
your earlier stuff.

153
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,225
Heavier stuff.

154
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,297
I usually keep the originals,
but since this one
never happened...

155
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,932
Can I still
run that interview?

156
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,167
-Yeah.

157
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,602
What station is it on?

158
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,203
-Uh, fm 85.5.

159
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,771
Breakfast with champions.

160
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,173
Thanks.
-Reece: Yo, tad-pole...

161
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,609
I'm sorry I almost
obliterated you, man.

162
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,011
-Not a problem.

163
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,214
Take it easy.

164
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,295
-At least the dude can draw.

165
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,768
-Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

166
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,244
-Yo, pat...

167
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,148
You know, there's something
I've never told people...

168
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,052
Or anyone,
for that matter.

169
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,855
-What?

170
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,196
-Was that real? Ew!

171
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,364
-Tiger:
Open your window.

172
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,399
-Sam:
Good.

173
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,880
-You tad's friends?

174
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,014
-Uh, he sent us.

175
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,416
Are you cousin Dan?

176
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,017
-Daniel:
Daniel.

177
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:33,017
You guys look hammered.

178
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,720
-Tiger:
One night at tad's
will do that to you.

179
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,155
And if your girl's
gonna be crashing--

180
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,690
-don't mention that.

181
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,859
-Okay, I was just--
-yeah, no worries whatsoever.

182
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,061
Just shut the fuck up
about it him and me and her.
-Yeah.

183
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,063
-Drummer? Drummer?

184
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,869
Using the house kit
or are you using yours?

185
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,170
-I'll use mine.

186
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,938
-Okay. Load in's here.

187
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,342
-Sam:
That's bullshit.

188
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,146
-"Aren't rights"? Yeah.

189
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,063
-Stage rest in here.

190
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:19,063
Don't block the hallway.

191
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,933
The owner doesn't fuck around
with the fire codes.

192
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,067
Sound check in 15.

193
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,269
You're on in 20.
-Got it.

194
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,813
-Pat:
Hey, tiger...

195
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,447
Are you okay?

196
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,216
-Yeah, I'm fine.

197
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,351
-Sam:
Are these guys not creeps?

198
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,453
--They run a tight ship.

199
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,355
-Except it's a u-boat.

200
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,295
-Hey, y'all...
I got a dumb idea.

201
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,868
-Stagehand:
Where'd you say
the power supply was?

202
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,903
-It's like a mini-transformer...

203
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,840
-Testing, testing one, two.

204
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,408
Meow.
-Stagehand: Got it!

205
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,777
-Pat:
There's no guitar.

206
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,814
-Or not.
-This was your fucking idea.

207
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,482
You back out now,
i tell them you're Jewish.

208
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,417
Go.

209
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,385
-Evening, ladies and gentlemen.

210
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,087
We are the ain't rights,

211
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,089
or the aren't rights.

212
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,858
Either one...

213
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,492
Two, three, four!

214
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,555
-Crowd:
Fuck off! Come on!

215
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,592
-Thank you.
That was a cover.

216
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,127
What should we do next?

217
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,295
-Sam:
Coronary.

218
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,298
-Tiger:
This one's a treat.

219
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,039
-Sam: What happened
to fire code?
-Yeah, sorry guys.

220
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,407
We have to make room
for the headliner.

221
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,541
-Cowcatcher, right?

222
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,276
-Big Justin:
Yes. You gotta clear out, okay?

223
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:52,276
Here you are.

224
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,447
-Thank you.
-Big Justin: And it's all there.
And you guys follow me, okay?

225
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,116
All right.

226
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,718
I'll get you one more
two liter for the road.

227
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,286
Okay, come on.

228
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,157
-You all right with that?
-I'll be careful. I understand.

229
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,159
-Aw, shit. My phone...
-Pat: What?

230
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,560
My phone. I--
I'll catch up with--

231
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,262
-i got you.
-Sam: Thanks.

232
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,466
-Excuse me, y'all.

233
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,474
-Oh shit.

234
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,243
-Can you call the cops?
-Guitarist: Fuck that.

235
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,611
-Hey, stop!

236
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,179
What the fuck?

237
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,448
-I told you to follow.

238
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,184
-No!

239
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,420
Go, go, go!

240
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,289
Uh, yeah. I-- i--
i guess I am. I don't know.

241
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,657
There's been a--
there's been a stabbing!

242
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,025
She-- whoa! Whoa!

243
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,361
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

244
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,130
--Goddamn it!

245
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,566
-They didn't lock the door.
You didn't lock the door!

246
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,701
-No! Don't talk
and don't touch them!

247
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,669
Stay put!

248
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:51,669
It's fine.

249
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,505
-What the fuck happened?
-Just give me a minute!

250
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,509
Something terrible.
Stay with them.

251
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:24,435
-Okay.
-Sam: Oh, shit!

252
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,206
- It's okay. Don't worry,
don't worry. Get back inside.

253
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,540
-What the fuck is going on?

254
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,675
-Gabe:
Up. In the room.

255
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,243
Hey! Go! Go!

256
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,512
Up the stairs.
It's okay. Let's go.

257
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,180
Just go. Come on, guys.

258
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,715
-Tiger: Shit.
-Gabe: It's okay.

259
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,685
--Oh, what the fuck, man?

260
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,153
-Gabe:
It's okay. It's fine.

261
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,489
Turn that pa down.

262
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,591
-You didn't lock the door.
-You were right there!

263
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,359
-Big Justin: Until I wasn't!
-Gabe: Quiet!

264
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,564
Hello?
<i> -</i> Woman: <i> This is</i>
<i> emergency services.</i>

265
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,800
-Yeah, we got cut off.
I was calling to report
a stabbing.

266
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,485
-Gabe:
Yes.

267
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,254
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,491
-Did you call Darcy?

269
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,194
-He's on his way.
He knows about that...

270
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:23,194
Not this.

271
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:27,131
-You can't keep us here, man.
You gotta let us go.
-Gabe: We're not keeping you.

272
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,566
You're just staying.

273
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,136
You're up.
-What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

274
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,237
-Just relax!

275
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,107
Everyone, just relax.

276
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,542
Cops are coming.

277
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,651
-See how easy that is?
-Motherfucker!

278
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,120
Look what you did!
-Amber, chill the fuck out!

279
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,322
- Yes. Please.

280
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,894
-Darcy here?
-Not yet.

281
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,696
-I need $600 cash.

282
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,798
-You just signed out $350.

283
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,667
-Somebody's dead.

284
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,538
-Still gotta keep the books.

285
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,213
What else do you need?

286
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,914
-A true believer.

287
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,683
-How 'bout two?

288
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,293
- Maybe she's not dead.

289
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,394
-Sam:
I'm just saying.

290
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,330
Like, there's not
a lot of blood.

291
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,333
You know, so, like,
maybe she's just...

292
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,235
And who are we
to say that she's...

293
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,269
Sam: Oh, shit!

294
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,574
-Big Justin:
Come on, man.

295
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,577
What are you doing?

296
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,679
Tiger: The fuck, man?

297
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,448
-There it is.

298
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,983
-Oh, my god.

299
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,258
-Reece: We gotta go.
We gotta fucking
go right now.

300
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,959
-Now we didn't see shit.

301
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,463
We-- we--
we were so drunk.

302
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,266
-All right, just wait, okay?

303
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,901
Cops are on the way.

304
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,503
-Gabe:
Above and beyond, gentlemen.

305
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,772
You need me to do it?

306
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,708
-Twin 1: Nope.
-Won't even be the first time.

307
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,645
--Hurry up.

308
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,446
Twin 1: Go.

309
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,884
-All right, that's it.

310
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,354
-Okay, let me see it.

311
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,423
The knife.

312
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,325
It's an inch too short
for felony possession,

313
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,527
so you don't have to worry
about the...

314
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,962
Actually, give me
that money back.

315
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,263
-Twin 2:
What?

316
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,364
It's like vouchers
and shit.

317
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,532
We'll hold it for you.
Come on.

318
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,037
If you do any time,
we'll double it.

319
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,847
Now talk to 'em.

320
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,655
-You the victim?
-Twin 1: Yes, officer.

321
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,790
-Officer:
Kneel down.

322
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,058
Both of you,
ankles crossed.

323
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,863
-Gabe:
That's the owner.

324
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,066
I called him too.

325
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,271
-Darcy:
All right, let's give them
some room to work, folks.

326
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:21,806
-Are you the owner?

327
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,607
-Darcy:
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,466
-Cowcatcher, clear out.

329
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,701
-Hey, where are the cops?

330
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,537
-Gabe: Get your stuff, man.
-Tiger: What about us?

331
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,772
-Amber:
What are you doing?

332
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,875
-We're sorting it out.
Just hang tight, Amber.

333
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,588
-Your set was pretty good.

334
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,457
-What?

335
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,765
-What was the name
of your second to last song?

336
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,501
-Uh...

337
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,405
To-- toxic evolution.

338
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,575
-It's fucking hard, man.

339
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,946
That's the one
i did her to.

340
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,929
-All right, he's got
six bullets...

341
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,831
-For real?
-...If we all go at once--

342
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,699
-tiger: Guys, hold off a sec.
-For what?

343
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,902
-Sam: We haven't done anything!
-It doesn't matter.

344
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:01,372
-Okay.
They're called cartridges.

345
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:04,708
The bullet is the part
that enters your brain

346
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,977
if you keep talking shit.

347
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:11,081
And this gun only has
five cartridges, not six,

348
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:15,119
'cause they're big as fuck
and only five fit the cylinder.

349
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:21,459
So, please shut the fuck up
and don't test me.

350
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,860
-Reece, you're making it worse.

351
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:26,130
-We sit and we wait.

352
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,832
-And we die?

353
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,534
-Not if you sit
and you wait.

354
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,471
-It's just the one
to 911 at 3:45

355
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,206
and then mine
was at 3:47.
-You called?

356
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,576
-911 called back
and I answered.
-Be clear.

357
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,145
Who else knows besides--
you said Daniel's cousin?

358
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:41,145
-Tad.

359
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,048
There was a text from him
last night with our address,

360
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,115
but he doesn't know anything.

361
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,918
-Except who they are,
where they are...

362
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,888
Maybe where
they're supposed to be next.

363
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,256
Fuck.

364
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,859
Check emails.

365
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,061
-They played their set
to the crowd.

366
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,063
-Then we'll assume
the wide world knows

367
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,165
and they'll be tracking that.

368
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,600
-Give it to me.

369
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,968
I was trying to
buy some time

370
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,703
and contain this
until we could--

371
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,438
-contain?

372
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,772
-It was pretty rapid fire.

373
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:13,544
-I appreciate your initiative
and we all love werm.

374
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,845
-He's a brother.

375
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,515
-And you might have
visited him in prison.

376
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,117
Makes a difference.

377
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,721
Now we're all
in the stew

378
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,123
for an impulsive act,

379
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,626
for a selfish act,

380
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,495
under my roof.

381
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,797
You see a way
out of this?

382
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,166
-Gabe:
For them?

383
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,535
No.

384
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,936
-We still have to find one.

385
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,776
Okay. This is good.

386
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,078
-No guns.

387
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,983
You have a "no trespassing" sign
posted at the residence?

388
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,585
-We got
"beware of dogs."

389
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,886
-That's better.

390
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,028
-Does anyone even
know we're in here?

391
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,864
-No one who cares. Tad?

392
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,704
-I think we go.
-I think we go too.

393
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,508
- Big Justin: The next
person that moves--

394
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,510
-Gabe:
Everyone okay?

395
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,545
-Just about.

396
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,846
Gabe?

397
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,948
-Gabe: Yeah. Open up.
-No!

398
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,249
-Where are the cops?
-Big Justin: Okay...

399
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,517
Do you want
me to open the door,

400
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,652
or do you want me to blow
your fucking head off?

401
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,655
Back the fuck off!
-Gabe: What's going on?

402
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,756
-They're trying to run at me!

403
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:32,756
-Gabe:
Do not shoot them!

404
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,092
-Big Justin:
You know what?
That's on them.

405
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,093
-Where are the cops?

406
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,695
-Gabe:
Give them the gun!

407
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,897
-Say again?

408
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,565
-Gabe:
It's over!

409
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,967
Give them the gun.

410
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,235
-Okay, I told you
they just tried
to run at me--

411
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,804
-Gabe:
Then take the bullets out!

412
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,005
Just hand it over now!

413
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,974
Do not shoot them!

414
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,342
-Is Darcy here?

415
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,578
-Gabe: He is.
-Darcy: I am.

416
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,949
Gentlemen, I'm the owner.
-Okay, why the fuck
didn't you just tell me?

417
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,317
-Darcy:
Truly sorry about this.

418
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,319
Playing catch-up here myself.

419
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,021
-They're playing
a fucking show.

420
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:06,190
-Pat:
Uh...

421
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,792
Thank you, but...

422
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,594
We open the door
for the police,

423
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,930
or we keep the bullets.

424
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:15,766
Uh, the cartridges.

425
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,034
-Darcy:
I've got no problem with that.

426
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,169
-Okay, I handed them the gun.

427
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,938
I'm gonna head out now.
-No, you're not.

428
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:20,938
-Let him open the door.
-Hang on.

429
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,642
-No, he gave us the gun,
he gave us the gun--
-big Justin: Nobody is...

430
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,578
Letting me do anything.
I gave you the goddamn
gun, okay?

431
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,912
-Darcy: So how are we doing?
-He's right.

432
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,814
Pat, do the math.

433
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,852
Where are the police?
-Darcy: It takes
a while out here.

434
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,122
-Stay back.
-Darcy: Just want to make sure
that no one else gets hurt

435
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:38,122
in the meantime.

436
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:42,192
- Big Justin: Okay, I gave
you the damn gun...

437
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,296
- Tiger!

438
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,801
-Reece: Get him down!
-Darcy: Justin?

439
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,069
-Reece:
Get him down!

440
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,340
-Darcy:
What's happening?

441
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,147
-Shh!

442
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,682
Darcy: Justin?

443
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,317
Shouldn't have locked the door.

444
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,752
-Shit. Sam!

445
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,158
-Get the bullets!

446
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:18,929
All right, load the gun.

447
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,765
-Darcy: How's it going in there?
-Big Justin: Not good!

448
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,202
-Fine, but we would rather
wait for the police!

449
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,737
-Darcy:
Justin?

450
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:27,938
-Reece:
He's fine...

451
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,308
But he's gonna wait too!

452
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,146
-Understood, gentlemen.

453
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,282
Hold tight.

454
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,186
-You think they know?

455
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,021
-I think they're
smarter than you!

456
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,089
-Darcy...

457
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,224
Man.

458
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:50,294
-I apologize.

459
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,900
We'll do it here.
Stage it up the road.
-Okay.

460
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,811
-Pat: Hey, what was
that Gonzo shit, man?
-So in a tournament,

461
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,715
I snap his arm or he taps out
and we all go get burgers.

462
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,283
-Snap it.
-Come on.

463
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:13,283
-Look, we've got the gun.

464
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,386
Why don't we just let him--
-wait, wait. I don't want it.

465
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,055
All right? I don't--
i don't feel good with it.

466
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,356
Who wants it?

467
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,290
-Not me.
-Sam: Hm?

468
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,159
-No. I can't shoot.
-I can.

469
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,327
-No, not you.

470
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,262
-Then fucking keep it.
-Reece: Keep it, Sam.

471
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,697
I'll take it
when I'm up.

472
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:27,931
When I let go...

473
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,333
What are you gonna do?

474
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,969
Butt-fuck everyone
in the room.

475
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,140
-You're gonna sit
criss-cross applesauce.

476
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,375
Say it.

477
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,512
-I'm gonna sit
criss-cross apple sau--

478
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,482
-nice.

479
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,884
-Now lean against the chair.

480
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,288
-Hey, is there another
way out of here?

481
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,523
-No.

482
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,760
-You fed 'em yet today?

483
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,028
-It doesn't matter.

484
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,429
They're professionals.

485
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,198
-Darcy:
You might lose
a couple by morning

486
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,366
maybe a bunch.

487
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:04,001
-Clark:
Like I said, they're pros.

488
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,869
They earn.

489
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,437
-You'll be compensated.

490
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,140
Christ. How many people
are on that list?

491
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,979
-Clark:
It's 1,200 for a prospect,

492
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,981
two for a bait dog.

493
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,284
No studs, no champs
unless you wanna pay

494
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:20,284
20 grand a head.

495
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,987
-Darcy:
This might cost you
your livelihood, Clark.

496
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,890
As long as it doesn't
cost me mine, you're covered.

497
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:30,360
-There are gonna be cops,
so clean up the residence.

498
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,396
Maybe leave a roach
in an ashtray.

499
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,933
Put Daniel on that door
and bring the Van around.

500
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,234
Shit.

501
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:38,435
The keys.

502
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,271
-They're with them,
i guess.

503
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,472
I don't know.
-We need them.

504
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,474
-I got a ton
of shit to do.

505
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:45,876
-Go on.

506
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:48,111
This is a fire hazard.

507
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,318
-I wouldn't put
Daniel on the door.

508
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,486
-Fine. Plenty to do.

509
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,022
Where's Daniel?

510
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,390
-He stepped out.
I'm covering.

511
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,394
Everything okay?

512
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,370
-Meet me
at the utility shed.

513
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,283
-Darcy:
This a new ride?

514
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,417
-Yeah.

515
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,086
Just turning it over.

516
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,220
I think it's getting choked.

517
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,188
Wrong filter.

518
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,123
-She's a beaut.
-What's up?

519
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,591
-Need some
of the squad.

520
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,059
Red laces only.

521
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,961
-Tonight?
-Darcy: Now.

522
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,096
The list.

523
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,033
This is everybody
who knows?

524
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,401
-Yeah. Including the band.

525
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,502
-Knows what?

526
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:46,937
-Manageable.

527
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,907
From here on out,
not a single name gets added

528
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,375
unless they have red laces.

529
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,076
-There's 80 people in there.

530
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,012
-You plus four.

531
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:58,115
Give Gabe the keys
in case we have to play valet.

532
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,385
We're losing light.

533
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,956
-Tiger: You got it?
-Sam: Yeah.

534
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,593
Whoa, watch out!

535
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:10,994
That could be asbestos.

536
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,063
-Tiger: It's not asbestos.
-You don't have
a phone, do you?

537
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,598
-They took it.

538
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,636
Hers too.
-I'm gonna search her, okay?

539
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,077
-Sam:
Careful. That one
could be a live wire.

540
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,245
-Tiger:
It's a speaker wire.

541
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,428
-Sam:
What'd you find?

542
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,696
-Pat:
Uh...

543
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,666
<i> "Fleisch wolf"?</i>

544
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,035
-Sam:
Uh... <i> Fleisch </i> means...

545
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,370
Uh, flesh.

546
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:54,938
Or meat.

547
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,540
Like a <i> fleisch </i> salad.
It's German.

548
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,642
-So "meat wolf"?

549
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,010
-Sam:
Yeah.

550
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,514
-This shit's solid.

551
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,416
-Great.
-Pat: There's nothing here.

552
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,222
Okay. Empty out your pockets.

553
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,256
-Come search me, faggot.

554
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,425
-Just shoot him.

555
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,395
-Come on.

556
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,264
-Can I get up?

557
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,566
-Reece:
On the chair.

558
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,036
Slowly. Slowly.

559
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,023
-Turn 'em out.

560
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,694
-Come on, man.
Other one.

561
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,633
-Oh fuck.

562
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,668
Good call.

563
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,337
-Turn it out,
for fuck's sake.

564
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,373
-Pat:
What is that?
Give that to me.

565
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,275
Hand it over!

566
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,510
Big Justin: Oops.

567
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,211
- Wait, was that a phone?

568
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,647
- Pat: Oh, shit. Point it--
point it at the door.

569
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,050
Point the gun at the door.
-Sam: Maybe it's the police.
It's a raid.

570
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:13,050
-Amber: Are you serious?
-Pat: Shh!

571
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:16,386
-Sam: Fuck off, Ilsa!
-Reece: Yo, quiet, okay?
Justin, don't move.

572
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,721
-Pat: Point the gun--
-Reece: Nobody move.

573
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,556
-Pat: Now if we get all behind--
-Reece: Nobody talk!

574
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,657
-Careful now.

575
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,506
Smoke this.

576
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,342
-Big Justin:
Deal.

577
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,514
-And if the cherry does
something that you don't like...

578
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,116
Shoot.

579
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,452
-Reece:
Thank you, Amber.

580
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,623
-Get comfortable.

581
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,534
-Sam:
Pretty smart for a Nazi.

582
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:05,802
-Amber:
I'm not a Nazi.

583
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,706
-Pat:
How do you fall
for this shit?

584
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,777
-Amber: Let's just say
the people who were gonna
hurt me weren't white.

585
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,545
-Pat:
Any of them women?

586
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,681
-Amber:
It's a problem
where I grew up.

587
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,783
-Reece: Guys.
-Pat: What about tonight?

588
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,518
I think we got
a white people--
-Reece: Guys! Shh.

589
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,652
-Amber:
Oh, fuck you.

590
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,774
- It looks like
we tripped our main.

591
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,377
-Our back-up gennie is fired up,
but we're gonna to have to

592
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,613
call it a day
and do some troubleshooting.

593
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,548
--We'll try again on Sunday.

594
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,749
No door charge.

595
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,685
Hell, free drinks
from 2:00 to 4:00.

596
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,504
-Those of you attending
the racial advocacy workshop
on Wednesday,

597
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,240
assume it's on
unless you hear otherwise.

598
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,842
And remember...

599
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,646
This is a movement,
not a party.

600
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,813
--All right.

601
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,916
Stay safe!
Godspeed.

602
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,853
-Who hasn't smoked yet?

603
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,658
All right, you guys are
gonna come with me.

604
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:54,377
-You're not
worried they'll talk?

605
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,447
-They've got priorities.

606
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,888
Tell them the party is
on us if they hole up
for a couple of days.

607
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,224
Put this fire out first.

608
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,558
-Grove street?

609
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,329
-My dope nigger stamps
in case one of these meat-heads

610
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,364
gets booked
for possession.

611
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,433
All right.

612
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,568
Let's get y'all
somewhere safe.

613
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,816
-Sam:
Treasure?

614
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,452
-Daylight. Underneath.

615
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,856
-They're moving our gear.

616
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,827
-Yes?
-Darcy: Gentlemen?

617
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,762
We're loading you out.

618
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,731
-Are there cops here?

619
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,934
-Darcy:
They've come and gone.
It got a little complicated.

620
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,969
-We're so fucked.

621
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,739
-Darcy:
Uh, I'm getting hoarse.

622
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,776
Can you hear me
if I speak at this volume?

623
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,944
-Yeah.
-Yes.

624
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,312
-Darcy:
Good.

625
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:03,313
Um...

626
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:06,483
And can we please
elect just one voice?

627
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,421
-Yes.

628
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:14,457
-Darcy:
Okay. Now, you're trapped.

629
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,259
That's not a threat.
It's a fact.

630
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,295
-Well, we have a loaded gun.

631
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,863
That's also just a fact.

632
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:22,766
-Darcy:
Oh, we have plenty
more guns on hand.

633
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:25,435
We just want you out.

634
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,770
Not harmed.

635
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,309
Now, the firearm you have
is not registered.

636
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:36,379
I wanted it out of the picture
before the authorities arrived,

637
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,348
but you refused,
so here we are.

638
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,716
-Bullshit.
-Yeah.

639
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,352
Here we are.

640
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:45,455
-Darcy: Oh, I do apologize
for my associates.
They panicked.

641
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,857
-Yeah, no shit! Man, we're--
-Darcy: Listen! Listen!

642
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,895
No one is trying
to wipe the slate clean.

643
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,334
Whatever you saw or did
is no longer my concern.

644
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,536
You tell whoever you want
whatever you want.

645
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:03,940
All I ask is that
you understand
you were held here

646
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:07,911
for your own safety
before you were released.

647
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,350
-Okay.

648
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,686
Yes. Thank you.

649
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,822
But just...

650
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:22,025
Just to be clear...

651
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,626
The police are coming back?

652
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,495
-Darcy:
They've come and gone.

653
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,997
-Well, that's what
concerns us, man!

654
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,134
-Darcy:
I just want that gun
out of the picture.

655
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,807
-Okay.

656
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,378
-Reece: Careful, man.
-Sorry.

657
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,613
-What do we do?
-We dig through
the fucking floor.

658
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:43,613
-While we just wait?

659
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:46,816
They could shoot us
at any time.
-Yeah, but they haven't.

660
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,451
How do we even know
that they have guns?

661
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,553
-They have guns.
No question.

662
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,021
-We're gonna trust you?

663
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,925
-We've got zero leverage.
-Ask for a phone...

664
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,428
For the gun.
-All right.

665
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,064
-What about him?
-Yeah, I mean,
the minute we give it up,

666
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,032
what if he just, like, attacks?
-Then I'll wrap him up.

667
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,702
-Okay.

668
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,004
So we see what they think?
-Mm-hmm.

669
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,409
-All right.

670
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:17,647
Uh, we'll give you
the gun for a cell phone.

671
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,082
-Darcy:
Sorry, no.

672
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,919
-Okay, well, how about
a registered firearm?
-Darcy: Funny.

673
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,555
Justin, you alive and well?

674
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:28,057
-I'm alive.
-Darcy: Okay, good.

675
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:32,896
Gentlemen, I hope
you appreciate the situation.

676
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:36,933
Things have gone south,
no doubt.

677
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:41,604
But you know if you don't
hand over that gun,

678
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,007
it won't end well.

679
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,809
You see...

680
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:49,612
For all I know, i--
i come to my place of business

681
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,648
and there is
an out of town band

682
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,150
locked in a room
with an unregistered firearm.

683
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,719
-Oh, come on!
-Darcy: And somebody's hurt
inside there

684
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,789
and maybe there's
a hostage, too!

685
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,659
So what do I do?

686
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,430
Am I within my rights
to intervene?

687
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:10,066
Should I kick down the door
and start shooting?

688
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,769
Darcy: Or...

689
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:17,073
Can we just remove
the guns from the equation?

690
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,175
These are my questions.

691
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,845
You've got
30 seconds to answer.

692
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,048
-Okay, hold on. Hold on.

693
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,984
Great. Anyone got
any smart ideas?

694
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,886
-Justin, get on the floor.

695
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,557
Get on the fuckin' floor
right now. Go.

696
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,462
All right. Sam,
come around here.

697
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,998
Slowly, I want you
to take the gun from me.
-Sam: Okay.

698
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,233
-Reece: You got it?
-Sam: Got it.

699
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,202
-Okay. Nice and easy.

700
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,505
Play nice,
and I'll be nice.

701
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:49,873
-Sam:
Please.

702
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:49,873
Don't do anything.

703
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,976
-This is fuckin' retarded.
-Pat: No one's saying it isn't,

704
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,545
but we either hand over the gun
or we open fire with it.

705
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:58,615
-I vote for that.
-You don't have a vote, okay?

706
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,650
--I mean we're taking
chances either way, so--

707
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,885
-tiger:
So we're fuckin' dead, guys.

708
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,786
-At least this way,
we find out

709
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,989
if all we're doing now
is buying time.

710
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,490
-For them.
-Reece: Amen.

711
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,659
At this point,
I'm just fucking curious.

712
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,967
-Okay...
We'll give you the gun.

713
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,804
But we're gonna
keep the ammo.

714
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:24,240
-Darcy:
Fine. Safer for everyone.

715
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,477
-All right, let's move
this fucking couch.

716
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,278
-Sam:
Okay.

717
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,893
-All right, keep still.

718
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,165
-Okay, stand back!

719
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,633
-Darcy:
You've got it.

720
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,040
-Here we go.

721
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,516
-Darcy:
May I approach?

722
00:43:06,518 --> 00:43:07,884
-Pat:
No!

723
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,886
No. I'm gonna throw it.

724
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:12,322
-Careful. It was a gift.

725
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,197
-They're killing us!
-Keep the gun!

726
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,802
- Get the fuck off of me!

727
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,237
--Okay, okay!

728
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,673
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

729
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,984
-Fuck you!

730
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,587
Tiger: Oh, my god!

731
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,255
Keep it up! Pull it up!

732
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,757
-Oh fuck.

733
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:50,994
-Yo, help me
move the couch.

734
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:55,832
-Reece:
Help me move it!

735
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:57,934
-Pat:
Oh, shit!

736
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,006
--This will be over
soon, gentlemen.

737
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,048
-I'll fuckin' crush you.

738
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,660
-Reece:
Get the box cutter!

739
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,697
Get the fucking box cutter
out of his hand!

740
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,239
-Tell me when he's out!
-Okay!

741
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,374
Tiger: Pat! Pat!

742
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:39,909
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

743
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,110
Shush! Shush!

744
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,278
Shush!

745
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,082
-He's out. He's out!

746
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,054
- Oh, fuck.

747
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:54,257
-Put pressure on it!
Put pressure!

748
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:55,792
-I know, I know, I know.

749
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,061
Just breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

750
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:00,363
-Sam:
He's not out!

751
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,397
He's not out!

752
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,868
-You got this?

753
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,758
-How long does it take...

754
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,828
Until we know... for sure?

755
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,867
What the...

756
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:38,935
-Oh, Jesus.

757
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,174
Oh, Jesus.

758
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,919
-Darcy:
Any and all firearms,

759
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,122
Clark will handle it
from here on.

760
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,723
He give you an e.T.A.?

761
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,358
-You said no calls.

762
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,060
-Right. Good.

763
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:05,728
Phones too.
-What happened in there?

764
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:05,728
-Darcy:
Set Neal up for tomorrow

765
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,332
new drywall, pour a floor.
Tell him we had a leak.

766
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:11,734
Door with a frame, too.
-What happened?

767
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,070
-Uh, a bit of
a maelstrom tonight.

768
00:46:14,072 --> 00:46:16,839
Visiting band hurt
one of ours.

769
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,074
-Daniel:
Who?

770
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:19,776
-Emily.

771
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:21,711
-Darcy:
Maybe big Justin, too.

772
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:22,845
-What the fuck
are we doing then?

773
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,914
Let's get in there.

774
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:28,718
-We're not coming apart
is what we are doing.

775
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,756
We're saving questions
until this pig fuck is
transferred off-site.

776
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,259
--Darcy.

777
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:40,329
-Okay. Last chance
if anyone needs to take a leak.

778
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,764
-I lost the gun.

779
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:17,366
-You held on longer
than I would have.

780
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,805
Hey.

781
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,340
I'm going.

782
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:28,444
There's no air shaft,
there's no sewer system...

783
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,880
No nothing.

784
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,349
-Tiger:
There it is.

785
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,388
-Sam:
What time is it?

786
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,890
-It's not daylight.

787
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,391
-It's something.

788
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,093
-Out the way.

789
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,622
-Tiger:
Oh, fuck.

790
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,659
-Look for a door.

791
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,532
-Pat:
Just let me know.

792
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:26,903
Hey...

793
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,908
I'm sorry
about your friend.

794
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,382
Reece: Shit!

795
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,120
-Okay, move.

796
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:45,488
-Tiger:
Fuck!

797
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,368
-Sam:
Is there a lock?

798
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,271
-Other side, maybe.

799
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,273
We're burning time.

800
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,508
-Wait, but...

801
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,543
Look! There's--
there's ventilation!

802
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,078
-Reece:
Six inch ducts.
Good luck.

803
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,880
-Sam:
Shouldn't we look around more?

804
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,248
-Reece:
We just did!

805
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,583
Go. Go, go. Push.

806
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,260
-Amber:
Heroin.

807
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:28,264
It's not about her or us.

808
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,969
-It's a-- it's
a big ass bunker.

809
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,670
-Tiger: Give me your hand.
-Reece: Big ass dead end.

810
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,172
-Tiger:
Give it to me.
Hold it up, up, up.

811
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:37,506
--All right.
Look away, look away.

812
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:39,008
-Maybe we can use this
to our advantage.

813
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,176
-Reece:
We're done.

814
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:41,344
I'm done.

815
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:46,415
Okay? You can
close the door behind me
if you want to strategize.

816
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,118
-We're not ready!
-What do you think
they're doing out there?

817
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,053
-That's just it.
We don't know.
-We fucking know

818
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,455
they mean us harm!

819
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:54,457
- Sam: It's just that
if have guns,

820
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,258
okay, why haven't
they mowed us down already?

821
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
-We can't just go missing.

822
00:49:58,262 --> 00:49:59,929
They need us found.

823
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:01,697
-All right.
Grab some shit

824
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:02,698
and get ready to run.

825
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,066
-Then we die.

826
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:06,168
- Yeah, but the longer we wait,

827
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,670
the surer that is.

828
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,374
Tiger, you ready?
-Tiger: Yeah, almost, man.

829
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,777
-Pat:
We can't take it so seriously.

830
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,950
We gotta...

831
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:24,353
Treat this like paintball.

832
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,189
-What?

833
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,559
-Rick silva...

834
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:38,100
Helped organize the paintball
for skate-o's bachelor party.

835
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:42,338
And we were short a few players
to book the whole field,

836
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:48,010
so they paired us up
with these ex-marines.

837
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:51,680
And the first few rounds,
these guys just...

838
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:55,184
Tore us to shreds.

839
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,387
I mean, zero casualties
on their side.

840
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,490
And I just cowered
behind these trees

841
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,459
till I got shot.

842
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,761
Covered in paint. But Rick--

843
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,663
-Reece:
Tiger, you done?

844
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,700
-Okay.

845
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,202
Pat, you're done, too.

846
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,603
-I'm sorry, man.
We gotta go.

847
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,272
-That's okay.

848
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,307
-Was that a pep talk?
-Tiger: Ready?

849
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,280
-Reece:
Now we won't all live, but...

850
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,817
I don't know.
Maybe we won't all die.

851
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,058
-Here.
-No, I'm just gonna run.

852
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,560
-Tiger:
I got it.

853
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,398
-All right, fuck it.
Simon and Garfunkel.

854
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,335
Desert island band.

855
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:49,738
Prince.

856
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,110
-I, uh...

857
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,680
-I'm still the misfits.
-Reece: True school, man.

858
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,315
-Are we going?

859
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,451
-Sam:
Yeah.

860
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:13,295
-Madonna and... slayer.

861
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,500
-Here we go.

862
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,601
-Watch it!

863
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,539
-What the fuck?

864
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,375
-They're letting us out.

865
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:27,610
-Reece:
How many exits are there?

866
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:30,513
-Uh, the main, the back,
maybe the kitchen.

867
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:31,847
I always--
-what about windows?

868
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,282
-See for yourselves.

869
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:35,851
-Sam:
Fuck.

870
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,186
-Quiet.

871
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,624
-Oh, shit.

872
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,459
-Should we hide?

873
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,528
-Uh, whatever you want, man.

874
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,171
-Sam:
We-- we should split up.

875
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,639
-Totally.

876
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,683
-Sam:
What the fuck?

877
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,251
-Tiger!

878
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,390
- Tiger!

879
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:19,795
-Oh, shit, oh, shit.

880
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:25,768
Shit.

881
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,340
Oh, shit!

882
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,812
-Save it.

883
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:38,881
-Oh, shit.

884
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,320
<i> -Fass! Fass!</i>

885
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,924
<i> Voran! Fass!</i>

886
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,259
<i> Fass!</i>

887
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,936
-Hey.

888
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,820
-They're everywhere!

889
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,622
Where's Reece?

890
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,426
-Pat:
It's us.

891
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,434
Come on. Move.

892
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:41,870
Sam, look.

893
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,975
<i> -Fleisch wolf.</i>

894
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:48,711
-It's a song.

895
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,014
It means "meat grinder."

896
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,018
-Clark:
Up! Up!

897
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,986
<i> So ist's brav.</i>

898
00:55:57,988 --> 00:55:59,488
<i> So ist's brav.</i>

899
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,323
-You're retiring him?

900
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,359
-Clark:
He's worked up.

901
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,626
-Send in another.

902
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:05,728
Send two.
Finish it.

903
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,830
-Kill that feedback first.

904
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:11,066
And if I send in two fight dogs,
what do you think they'll do?

905
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,035
-Send me in there.
I'll finish up.

906
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:14,636
Just give me the rules.

907
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:16,004
-All right.

908
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,875
Blades only.

909
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,877
Sloppy is fine.

910
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,911
Try not to hit the bone.

911
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,646
-Okay.

912
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:26,315
-Darcy:
Take Jonathan.

913
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,683
-Brute squad.

914
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:29,551
-Keep him caged
until we tag out.

915
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,090
-He breathing?

916
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,599
-A little bit, yeah.

917
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,834
-Let him bleed.

918
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:48,771
Later is better
for time of death.

919
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:49,872
Keys?

920
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:51,840
-No.

921
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,908
-They're coming.

922
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,978
-I can't do this.

923
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,986
-Pat:
Get back!

924
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,122
-Sam:
No!

925
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,590
-Where's Emily?

926
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,098
-What the fuck
are you doing?

927
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,567
Hey!

928
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,571
-Which one did it?

929
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:57,072
-Werm did it.
-Daniel: Bullshit.

930
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:58,173
Which one?

931
00:57:58,175 --> 00:58:00,075
-What did they tell you?

932
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,946
What? You want to know?

933
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:06,648
You want him to know?

934
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,050
-Know what?

935
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:11,820
-Werm found out
that she was leaving...

936
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,890
But she didn't say
that it was with you.

937
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:18,193
"Meat grinder."

938
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:23,031
That song was their cue.

939
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,968
-You should go.

940
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:36,845
-Clark:
Here we go.

941
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,148
-This is taking too long.

942
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,919
Gabe?

943
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:49,157
You didn't want Daniel
on door duty.

944
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,626
Why?

945
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:55,163
-Nothing concrete, he and...

946
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,099
And Emily...

947
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,798
-Little lovebirds.

948
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,654
Recognize this?

949
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,557
-No, sir.

950
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,259
-Of course not.
You were still handing out

951
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,795
leaflets when these boys
made their bones.

952
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,663
It's from last easter.

953
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:05,133
Supposed to disappear
after the boot party.

954
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,003
-He just started talking.

955
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,771
Amber's alive
saying werm did it.

956
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,872
-Never mind that.

957
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:12,841
You...

958
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,880
Werm saved us all.

959
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,990
-Sam?

960
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,894
It's okay.

961
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,565
I mean,
it's not okay.

962
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:39,067
-You didn't know either?
-Pat: He's with us.

963
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,168
-Not where.

964
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,637
-Pat:
We gotta split.

965
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:49,077
-This has a wider duct, I think.

966
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,014
-Pat:
We're not gonna
fit through there.

967
01:00:52,016 --> 01:00:53,715
Sam: Oh!

968
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:56,218
-Daniel, um, he can help.

969
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,619
-Why?

970
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,221
Who's he?

971
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:02,124
-A traitor. If they don't
already know, they know now.

972
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:03,825
I can get us out of here.

973
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,761
-Wow. A conspiracy.

974
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:07,763
-No, just a cluster-fuck.

975
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,773
-There is still blades
and fangs for the visitors,

976
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:19,875
but we are getting
lean on time.

977
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,944
Now, if you have
to shoot, shoot once.

978
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:25,180
If more than once,
keep it a tight grouping

979
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,616
'cause you'll be digging
the slugs out yourself.

980
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:29,317
As for Daniel and Amber,
they can...

981
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,458
What did we forget?

982
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:49,204
-There's a river on two sides.
The quarry's on another.

983
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:52,340
We can parallel
the main road back,
go for help.

984
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,342
-Well, how do we get
past the door?

985
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,078
-I know something you don't.

986
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,879
-Sam:
Good. What?

987
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,715
-I know where we keep--

988
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:02,851
--too slow.

989
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,354
-Should we go?

990
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:40,856
Now?

991
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,324
-We have the gun.

992
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:44,192
I guess.

993
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:45,727
-Yes.

994
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:47,095
-Sam:
Yes!

995
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,197
-Give me two.

996
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,722
-Easy! Not her!

997
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:15,323
--Don't fire!

998
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,424
-Clark:
<i> Fass! Fass!</i>

999
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,459
<i> Fass!</i>

1000
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:20,162
-Sam:
Go!

1001
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:21,296
-Sam!

1002
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:23,465
-Sam!

1003
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,177
-We're never getting out.

1004
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,017
-Fuck.

1005
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,374
-You know, I'm lucky.

1006
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:09,544
I guessed at least
they were gonna shoot me.

1007
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,257
-Three'll do, gentlemen.

1008
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:23,825
The fourth can disappear.

1009
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,260
It's time to start
the clean-up.

1010
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:27,829
I'm gonna need
a push broom.

1011
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,799
This is supposed to
have happened already.

1012
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,267
Time to sprint.
-All: Yes, sir.

1013
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,170
-Darcy:
Well done.

1014
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:37,639
-Thank him.

1015
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:43,578
-Nearly got away
from me. Us.

1016
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,553
-Shouldn't we be panicking?

1017
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,525
-I'm hungry.

1018
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:08,136
-I can't die here with you.

1019
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,539
-So don't.

1020
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:17,145
You know, feel free just to...

1021
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,052
Hey, I want the rest
of your pep talk.

1022
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,290
-Oh, no.
It no longer applies.

1023
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:30,558
-Oh, come on.

1024
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,661
I'm curious.

1025
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:37,132
It was paintballing...

1026
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:39,467
You were cowering...

1027
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,472
-Yeah, Rick silva.

1028
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:52,113
We were getting slaughtered
by these legit Iraq vets.

1029
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,982
-It totally applies.

1030
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:59,287
-Full camo, thousand-dollar
automatic paintball guns.

1031
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:06,161
They knew real war
and they played real war.

1032
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:11,399
Tactics, hand signals, flanking.

1033
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:15,437
Just wiped us all out.

1034
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:22,577
So Rick gets fed up
and says, "fuck it."

1035
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:26,114
Didn't care
about getting shot.

1036
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,184
Didn't care about taking cover.

1037
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:32,220
It was hopeless, man.

1038
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:40,261
So the last match,
the whistle blows,

1039
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:44,432
and he just
tears out there,

1040
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:51,172
full jackass, in--
in sneakers and cut-offs

1041
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:55,543
and he... wipes out
their whole team.

1042
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,948
Doesn't stop.

1043
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:06,321
Just keeps running
and laughing and shooting...

1044
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,092
Until they're all dead.

1045
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,564
-Pretend dead.

1046
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,169
And we're up
against real guns.

1047
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,604
-Yeah.

1048
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:29,544
Either way,
we can't play real war.

1049
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,639
-Let's pretend.

1050
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:15,824
-For you.

1051
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,161
We're just mopping up tonight.

1052
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,097
You already earned these.

1053
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,703
Maybe push Neal,
depending on the mess,

1054
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,605
to start looking
for a new house band.

1055
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,374
We've really gotta get
back to a routine.

1056
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:35,343
-You think cowcatcher's
gonna talk?

1057
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:38,213
-I'm more worried
about their habits.

1058
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:41,783
Really have to stay away
from that nigger dope.

1059
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,786
There's a bad batch
doing the rounds.

1060
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,597
-We're good to go.

1061
01:08:58,701 --> 01:08:58,700
We're set.

1062
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:03,905
-Darcy:
This all hinges on nothing
having happened here.

1063
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:07,142
Now, let's be clear.

1064
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:12,847
-Clark:
This should keep him alive
for another hour.

1065
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:15,116
I would consider it
a personal favor

1066
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,784
if he dies with meat
in his teeth.

1067
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:21,623
Come on. Come on.

1068
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,394
-Bite command is <i> "fass."</i>

1069
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,464
It's all you'll need.

1070
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,141
-Disregard. Just shoot
who is left.

1071
01:09:40,143 --> 01:09:41,876
They don't have to
be accounted for.

1072
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:44,512
Forensics is
no longer a concern.

1073
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,551
We call this in late,
all is for naught.

1074
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,124
-You guys got
any 12 Gauge?

1075
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:58,193
-Not in the office.
Try the bar.

1076
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,328
-How many shots you have left?
-Kyle: Three.

1077
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,529
-So you have one extra.

1078
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,412
-No shells.

1079
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,351
-Jonathan:
Behind the bar.
Better get started.

1080
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:38,233
--Shit!

1081
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,802
-Jonathan:
Easy! Easy!

1082
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,706
Easy!

1083
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,507
--No buckshot!

1084
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,197
-Gabe:
What's happening?

1085
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,232
-Dog freaked.
And turn this shit off!

1086
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,934
-I tried! It's not coming
from our mixer.

1087
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,569
-Go! We got this.

1088
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:17,338
And don't tell Darcy.
Or Clark.

1089
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,577
We going?
-Yeah.

1090
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:24,612
Hey!

1091
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:28,716
-Pat:
Down there, you dip-shit fashion
punk clown motherfuckers!

1092
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,285
-Turn around!
-Pat: <i> Shazbot!</i>

1093
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,320
-What? What--
who is that?

1094
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:34,322
-Odin himself.

1095
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:02,984
-Give me the shotgun.

1096
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,485
-No, I got the shotgun.

1097
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,921
-Then you go down
this fucking hole.

1098
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,591
-Three shots?

1099
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:10,591
-Yeah.

1100
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:14,562
You hear me fire twice,
you come down no matter what.

1101
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:16,564
-This is a trap.
-Yeah, no shit.

1102
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:17,832
You wanna go tell Darcy?

1103
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,006
He's gonna be pissed.

1104
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,645
Watch my back.

1105
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,438
Fuck this.

1106
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,042
Get Gabe, man!

1107
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:02,810
We need two down here
and one up there.

1108
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,546
Who's got the nine?
-I think Alan does,
but I'm not sure--

1109
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,049
--oh, fuck! Block it!

1110
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:10,818
-Amber:
Pat!

1111
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:13,888
He's got three shots left!

1112
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,423
-Bitch.

1113
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,502
Gabe!

1114
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:36,711
-Pat:
Amber!

1115
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:37,979
-Yeah?

1116
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,781
-Uh...

1117
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,450
Never mind!

1118
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,560
-Amber:
Two shots left!

1119
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,538
-Nice fuckin' try!

1120
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,542
Go fuck yourself!

1121
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,950
-Shit. Shit.

1122
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,776
Oh, shit!

1123
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,179
-Amber:
Pat!

1124
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,981
One shot left!

1125
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,555
-Fuck.

1126
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,731
-Zero.

1127
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:11,906
-Oh, shit!

1128
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,247
-Get off of me!

1129
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:57,852
-Got him.

1130
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,255
-Totally.

1131
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:06,160
Flabbergasted that motherfucker.

1132
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,683
-If I had any idea...

1133
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,956
-Amber:
Anymore dogs?

1134
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,226
-People?

1135
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:40,861
-No. Not here.

1136
01:16:40,863 --> 01:16:44,065
They're... up the road.

1137
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,013
I don't want to go to jail.

1138
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,354
-Does anyone know
how to hotwire a car?

1139
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:41,722
-No.

1140
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:44,058
-I'd stay off
the road anyway.

1141
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,877
-Are you gonna shoot me?

1142
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,846
-Where's werm?

1143
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:09,917
-We sent him home--
-stay quiet till we're out.

1144
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,843
- It's the residents.

1145
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:38,713
-What are they doing?

1146
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:41,115
-Something you don't
want to see.

1147
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:46,087
-We can call the cops
when we get to the orchard.

1148
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,860
-Did you see them die?

1149
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,363
-Two.

1150
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:57,998
Not the third.

1151
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,205
-I think I'm going.

1152
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:08,075
-You can call the cops
when you get there.

1153
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,945
If you disappear,
I'll find you.

1154
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:12,213
-I will.

1155
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:18,385
I promise.

1156
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,356
-You should go, too.

1157
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,526
Just hedge our bets.

1158
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,897
-You got three rounds...

1159
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:32,800
And I've seen
you pump a shotgun.

1160
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,002
- Fair enough.

1161
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:51,952
Do you believe him?

1162
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,489
- Shh.

1163
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,370
<i> Nimm futter!</i>

1164
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,507
<i> Nimm futter!</i>

1165
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,448
-Clark:
<i> Nimm futter!</i>

1166
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,417
<i> Nimm futter!</i>
<i> Nimm futter!</i>

1167
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,253
-Alan: Jesus.
-<i> Nimm futter!</i>

1168
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:29,890
-Alan:
That ought to be enough.

1169
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:31,926
-Clark:
<i> Lass es! Lass es!</i>

1170
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:33,160
<i> Lass es!</i>

1171
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,329
<i> -So ist's brav.</i>

1172
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:36,597
<i> Aus. Aus.</i>

1173
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:43,003
Wipe it down!

1174
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,142
-Do you think they'd
leave the engine on?

1175
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:51,212
-Clark:
Yeah. It'll run
the Gauge down too.

1176
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:53,414
Let's call this in.

1177
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,451
<i> Aus. Aus.</i>

1178
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:58,853
-You got the dog?

1179
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,322
-I got the dog.

1180
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,927
Tie him up.

1181
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:10,531
-Give me your gun.

1182
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:12,299
-I don't have one.

1183
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,102
-I'll shoot you either way
if you don't hand me one.

1184
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:23,644
Throw it.

1185
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,389
-They're making it our fault.

1186
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,328
-You were trespassing.

1187
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,437
-Pat:
It looks fishy to me.

1188
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:59,006
The cloth is
to make it seal.

1189
01:22:59,008 --> 01:23:00,708
I wouldn't do it like that.

1190
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,143
-They got my gun.

1191
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,712
-Shut up.
-Clark: Listen--

1192
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:22,229
-so we're doing that?

1193
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:24,565
-Why else would
we walk up here?

1194
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,769
-Pat:
I don't know.
And I was gonna...

1195
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,007
Ruin the crime scene.

1196
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,442
-Oh.

1197
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:38,278
I thought we'd
leave a new one.

1198
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,462
-This...

1199
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,732
Is a nightmare.

1200
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:01,769
-For us all.

1201
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:07,574
-Tell me those stupid fucking
words are his last.

1202
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,651
-Do you have a phone?

1203
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:23,524
It's funny.

1204
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,494
You were so scary
at night.

1205
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,364
-We need the police.

1206
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,254
-Tad on radio:
<i> Okay, I'm the ain't rights</i>
<i> from Washington, D.C.</i>

1207
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:02,122
-Sam on radio:
<i> Uh, technically, we're</i>
<i> from Arlington.</i>

1208
01:26:02,124 --> 01:26:05,492
-Tad on radio:
<i> Nice. Uh, and this is</i>
<i> for seaside hcfm.</i>

1209
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,866
-Reece on radio:
<i> Yeah, if we can afford it.</i>

1210
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:15,335
-Tad on radio:
<i> Yeah, no, I really dig</i>
<i> the analogue style.</i>

1211
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,838
<i> Uh, which brings me</i>
<i> to the fact that you guys</i>
<i> are hard to find.</i>

1212
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:11,792
-I know what it is.

1213
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,831
-What what is?

1214
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:25,572
-My desert island band.

1215
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:33,780
-Tell somebody
who gives a shit.
