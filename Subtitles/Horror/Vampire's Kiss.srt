1
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,409
It was very...

2
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,290
I got up, took a shower,
made myself coffee.

3
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,251
I kept telling myself, I'll wake her up
after I do this or this little step.

4
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,778
That's not true. I knew I was going to delay
waking her up for as long as possible.

5
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,539
What was it you really wanted?

6
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,739
I wanted her... Same as always,
I wanted her to disappear.

7
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,495
I wanted her to be
the hell out of there.

8
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,491
And she got the hell out of there.

9
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,810
She took the hint.

10
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,734
She woke up, you were dressed,
ready to go to work.

11
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,210
More or less, yeah. She took the hint.

12
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,049
And yet, just the night before...

13
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,973
You wanted her very badly?

14
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,972
Yeah.

15
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,573
I know. Really badly.

16
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,769
He can stretch himself...

17
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,171
He can stretch himself
from here to Ethiopia.

18
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,377
- We said him already.
- No, no. The rubber man.

19
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,816
He's the last of the Fantastic Four
that we've been searching for.

20
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,258
No, we already said him.
Look, there's a taxi. Taxi!

21
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,980
We are not in need of coach service, my lady.

22
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,736
- This is my kingdom and my palace...
- Come on. Come on.

23
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,095
- Be off.
- Goddam you fucking mind.

24
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,650
- Cock-suckers.
- Be off!

25
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,734
- The fireball.
- The one made of brown stones.

26
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,610
- That's Brownstone Man.
- No, his name is Lighter Brown.

27
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,769
God, the telephone company.

28
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,331
How could I take home a girl who work s
for the telephone company? Go home.

29
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,219
I'm the director of personnel.

30
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,578
She hires those incompetents. Oh, no.

31
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,578
What do you do, Mr Wise Guy?

32
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,696
Literature.

33
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,531
- A bit of chess?
- Yeah, baby.

34
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,329
- Checkmate.
- Does that mean you win?

35
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,731
A fucking bat!

36
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,334
All right now, just relax.

37
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,572
Oh, right.

38
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,777
Shoo! Shoo!

39
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,135
- "Shoo"?
- Shoo!

40
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,575
There's a... Never mind.

41
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,529
- Did you get it out?
- Let's go.

42
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,577
If I'd known you had
a fucking roommate...

43
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,738
Taxi!

44
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,136
Alva. Alva!

45
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,012
Yes, Mr Loew.

46
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,616
All right. Frank Heatherton
wants a copy of the first contract

47
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,772
he had for the sale
of his short story...

48
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,333
Rattesnake His, De Spiege.

49
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,779
It was his first foreign sale, and now
he wants to frame the agreement.

50
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,659
The story was sold in 1963.

51
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,938
And I know that's a long time
before either of us were here,

52
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,732
but there is no reason why the agency
shouldn't have a copy of it.

53
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,779
I looked under the Heatherton files
and under Rattesnake His

54
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,330
but I'm asking you to go through
the entire De Spiege file

55
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,173
because that is a fat file
and nothing is in order.

56
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,491
It will take hours,
but it will be there.

57
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,571
Somewhere.

58
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,136
- Please find it and bring it to me.
- Yes, Mr Loew.

59
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,851
Peter? Joel Reznick on O2.

60
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,410
Mr Loew?

61
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,490
Mr Loew? Are you there?

62
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,532
Starting with
your earliest years when you

63
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,373
somehow were taught to expect

64
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,818
something that wasn't
even halfway attainable.

65
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,572
Peter?

66
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,896
- Well, I guess my time's up.
- We have a couple more minutes.

67
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,654
You know, lately...

68
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,733
...you have always been telling me
when our time is up.

69
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,939
And I just wonder if maybe...?

70
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,379
Does it make you feel
a little insecure when I say...

71
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,692
- Well, what?
- Nothing. I was remembering...

72
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,297
I brought this girl up to my place
the other night. Really hot, you know.

73
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,815
And we're on the bed.

74
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,529
Suddenly, this bat
comes swooping down out of nowhere.

75
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,329
- A bat?
- Holy shit.

76
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,173
But this really happened.

77
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,856
This part I don't know if this
really happened or I dreamt it later.

78
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,534
I'm fighting this bat off all alone

79
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,410
and I'll be damned
if I didn't get... really turned on.

80
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,896
- You were aroused?
- Yeah.

81
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,257
But seconds before, you were
in the throes of passion.

82
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,775
- Yeah, I know.
- So then you were aroused.

83
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,171
- With the girl?
- Yes, with the girl.

84
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,255
Oh, sure. Yes. Absolutely.
But then she left the room and I was...

85
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,411
I mean... I came down.

86
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,255
I was in mortal combat
with a fucking bat. Give me a break.

87
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,733
You were fighting off the bat

88
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,937
and that's when
you had this new feeling?

89
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,059
Then, yes.
That is the precise order of events.

90
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,497
- And on that note...
- Oh, oh, yes.

91
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,538
- See you on Tuesday.
- Bye-bye.

92
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,579
Alva. I didn't see, did you find
that Heatherton contract?

93
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,768
I checked the files under Heatherton
and Rattesnake His,

94
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,612
but I couldn't find it.

95
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,375
I guess I'm gonna have to look
under the De Spiege files.

96
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,136
I told you that I already checked those files.
I already checked them.

97
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,656
Sorry. I must have misunderstood.

98
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,698
I'm gonna get right to it.

99
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,410
I don't know, maybe.

100
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,050
...inconceivable to me
that you like that play.

101
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,008
Oey, how you odo hg?
My hamoes Gay, whats you s?

102
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,978
I don't save the same amount
I put in the other account.

103
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,290
Say I put 2,000 dollars in the IRA.

104
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,179
That doesn't mean I save 2,000
at income tax time.

105
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,616
It's more like 700. Right, Peter?

106
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,659
Plus, I get interest on the 2,000
in the other account.

107
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,697
...raise high the roof beam.

108
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,248
- Did you get that joke?
- No.

109
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,409
I love your earrings.

110
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,897
Thank you.

111
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,259
I'm Peter Loew.

112
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,138
Rachel.

113
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,176
Rachel...

114
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,097
Ah!

115
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,694
God!

116
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,331
Shit!

117
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,696
God...

118
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,100
OK. OK. OK.

119
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,299
Yes. Yes.

120
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,093
Yes. Yes.

121
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,290
Who are you?

122
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,294
It's all right.

123
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,976
It's all right.

124
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,212
You chose me.

125
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,177
What a glorious Sunday.
How nice not to have to go in to work.

126
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,731
No comments on my coffee, please.
If you don't like it, I'll send out.

127
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,970
I do it all the time.

128
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,170
Well, do you like it?

129
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,979
I gotta take a piss.

130
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,451
You have reached Peter.

131
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,455
I am not in at the moment,
but leave your name, number and a message.

132
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,250
I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you.

133
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,289
Forget about
getting back to this girl. You son of a bitch.

134
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,497
You don't just walk out
on somebody like that, you bastard!

135
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,292
Don't you ever call me again.
You fuck! Fuck you!

136
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,933
Yeah, well fuck you, too, sister.

137
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,890
So... How was your weekend?

138
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,891
It was all right.

139
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,574
It was nothing earth-shattering.

140
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,732
Did you hurt yourself?

141
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,654
- Just cut myself shaving.
- Oh.

142
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,811
Well, Peter.

143
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,733
Why don't we begin
where we left off last week?

144
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,131
You started to tell me about
this strange feeling you had

145
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,976
when this bat flew through
the window of your apartment.

146
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,971
Huh?

147
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,769
The feeling of exultation
that you experienced.

148
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,170
You made it sound as though it were

149
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,649
something more than sexual.

150
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,371
I don't... really know
what you're talking about.

151
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,610
I don't remember.

152
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,329
You were sure about it last weekend.
It made a strong impression.

153
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,934
Oh, yes. OK. I know.

154
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,809
I guess I was pretty horny.

155
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,939
Pretty keyed up from being
with the girl right before.

156
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,178
I was drunk, too. That was it.

157
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,377
I'd had a little to drink.

158
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,694
I was a little drunk.
Plus I was horny.

159
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,733
And have you seen this girl again?

160
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,379
No.

161
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,936
Peter? Frank Heatherton on O3.

162
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,977
All right. And Judy,
send Alva in here right now.

163
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,975
Yes, Mr Loew.

164
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,212
That's Frank Heatherton on the phone. For me.

165
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,578
He's calling about the contract
which he still hasn't gotten a copy of.

166
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,699
How do I know he hasn't gotten a copy?
Because I haven't sent it to him.

167
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,250
Why haven't I sent it to him?
Because you haven't found it.

168
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,414
Now, it's fucking Tuesday and
I still don't see it on my desk. Do you?

169
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,140
Huh, Alva? No!

170
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,498
I'm going through the files,
but I have a million other things to do.

171
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,734
I want you to be here and listen to
the song and dance that I have to do.

172
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,735
That I have to do, because you
haven't done your job. Ready?

173
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,455
- Hi, Frank. How are you?
- Hello, Peter. I'm fine, thank s.

174
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,056
I just wanted to say
about that letter I sent,

175
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,179
requesting the copy
of Rattesnake His' sale to De Spiege.

176
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,731
There's absolutely no rush on that.
It's an old contract.

177
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,370
I'm sure you and your girls
got better things to do.

178
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,931
I'm in the middle of moving, so
I'll give you a call when I'm settled in.

179
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,294
Yeah, OK, Frank.

180
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,020
- So, is life treating you well?
- Yeah, Frank.

181
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,059
- Good. Take care, old buddy.
- All right. Bye-bye, Frank.

182
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,853
Well...

183
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,377
Seems I didn't have to do
a song and dance after all, Alva.

184
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,293
As you could hear,
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

185
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,337
Mr Heatherton is boiling mad,

186
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,288
and he has implied that if he
doesn't get that copy within the week,

187
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,610
he will terminate his agreement
with our agency

188
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,011
and sign up with a more efficient one.

189
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,138
Am I getting through to you, Alva?

190
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,451
I'll go right to it, Mr Loew.

191
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,568
Judy, I'll be out
for the rest of the day.

192
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,816
- Hey! Do I get waited on today or what?
- Right away, sir. Right away.

193
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,371
And then he took me on
one of those horse and carriage rides.

194
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,897
And in the middle of it,
he asked me to marry him.

195
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,415
Fucking greasehole!

196
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,216
Are you all right, sir? Sure? Are you?

197
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,612
- Hello.
- Dr Glaser?

198
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,692
You have reached the office
of Dr Dorothy Glaser.

199
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,215
Please leave your name...

200
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,176
- Hello?
- Jackie?

201
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,492
- Yeah?
- Jackie, don't hang up, please.

202
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,778
This is Peter.
I want to explain about the other day.

203
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,500
Hoeoe was a oeasoh

204
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,652
I had a very good reason
for doing what I did.

205
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,257
I... Look, you know
I'm very fond of you.

206
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,809
I didn't mean to hurt you. It was...

207
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,536
It was some illness. I feel funny
talking on the phone about this.

208
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,658
- Better be a hell of a good reason.
- Let's meet. Can you?

209
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,848
Tonight? You wanna get together tonight?
Meet somewhere?

210
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,251
- I can't for a couple of hours.
- Fine. Fine.

211
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,888
Let's just say nine o'clock.
Mondo Cane.

212
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,094
- All right. Nine o'clock.
- Great. Great. OK.

213
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,058
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

214
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,810
Who's there?

215
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,330
Who is it?

216
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,089
He is wondering,
"How did she get in here?"

217
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:14,335
And he is realising that he let her in,
as she is his lover.

218
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,970
His most passionate mistress.

219
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,290
And he is realising

220
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,612
that she is a jealous mistress.

221
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,975
Yes.

222
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,652
Alva... Alva?

223
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,690
Alva.

224
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,290
Alva.

225
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,535
Alva.

226
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,652
Alva.

227
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,851
Alva!

228
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,210
Alva! Alva!

229
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,092
There you are!

230
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,055
I'm looking for it, Mr Loew.
I'm looking.

231
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,529
What the hell is he doing in here?

232
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,216
I have a gun. If you hurt me,
I'm gonna use it.

233
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,292
What the fuck is going on?

234
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,372
I don't know... I'm doing all I can.

235
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,008
M ayboe t hoe coht act was ost

236
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,648
Don't come near me.

237
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,618
I'm telling Mr Langdon about this.

238
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,171
And I swear I'm gonna use my gun
if you ever touch me.

239
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,491
- Just once.
- No, no, Alva. I'm sorry.

240
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,019
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

241
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,098
You all right, honey?

242
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,693
Yeah.

243
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,495
Nothing like a little office trauma
to keep things interesting.

244
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,810
The chase was my favourite part.

245
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,370
Pete hurdling over those desk s.

246
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,849
You weren't there
for the grand finale.

247
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,659
She asked me for a raise.
Can you believe it?

248
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,778
She actually does keep a gun
in that little bag.

249
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,410
She takes the subway into Pelham
every night. I don't blame the kid.

250
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,890
She asked me for a raise
for getting chased into the ladies room.

251
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,973
I think she deserves it.
Take it out of Attila's pay-cheque.

252
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,653
Fuck you.

253
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,299
One question, Peter.

254
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,930
Is my name written anywhere
on the bathroom wall and...

255
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,056
...what did it say?

256
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,333
What is happening to me?

257
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,656
I...

258
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,859
...had a difficult day yesterday.

259
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,378
Got a little upset... at the office.

260
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,293
Do you want to talk about it?

261
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:34,052
It's just there's this contract
we're trying to locate.

262
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,970
Shouldn't...?

263
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,290
If a company...

264
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,135
If a literary agency makes a copy

265
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,019
of every contract...

266
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,493
of every single contract
it makes with a client

267
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,413
and then puts it in a file,

268
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,652
in the appropriate file...

269
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,818
shouldn't the copy be in that file?

270
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,620
- Yes, I suppose it should.
- It should. Right?

271
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,611
- Yes.
- Right?

272
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,859
Hmm.

273
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,296
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

274
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,974
Unless it's somehow been misfiled.

275
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,213
- Misfiled?
- Yes, misfiled.

276
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,611
Sometimes somebody
puts a document in the wrong file

277
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,090
and then it's misfiled.
It makes it much harder to find.

278
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,535
Who? Who? What do you mean? Who?

279
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,329
- I don't know who exactly.
- You don't?

280
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,775
No, I don't.

281
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,408
Whoever filed it in the first place, but...

282
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,459
...I am not telling you
anything you don't already know.

283
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,659
How could somebody misfile something?

284
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,812
What could be easier?
It's all alphabetical.

285
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,131
You just put it in the right file.

286
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,734
According to alphabetical order.

287
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,858
You know, A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

288
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,410
- Peter.
... H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P...

289
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,892
- Peter!
... Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z!

290
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,690
Huh? That's all you have to do.

291
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,169
Very good. You know your alphabet.

292
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,016
I never misfiled anything.
Not once. Not one time!

293
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,138
I'm sure that you didn't.

294
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,372
Wahha khow w ho od od?

295
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,976
I cannot possibly tell you that.

296
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,052
- You can't?
- No, I can't.

297
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:52,169
Hah! And you call yourself
a psychiatrist?

298
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,371
It's kind of bright in here, isn't it?

299
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,536
He is so eccentric.

300
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,255
Yes, Mr Loew?

301
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,254
Actually, she's just leaving,
Mr Loew. Sure.

302
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,095
Alva. Mr Loew would like to see you.

303
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,015
Come in, Alva.

304
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,177
I hope you're not still angry at me
about the other day.

305
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,219
I apologised, and I honestly meant it.

306
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,655
Pistachio?

307
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,378
Yeah. That mescaline. Wow.

308
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,976
That's strange stuff.

309
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,496
I'll never do that again. Jeez.

310
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,255
- Yeah, I know. I did it once.
- Did you? Did you?

311
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,130
- Yeah, just once in high school.
- Ah.

312
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,895
High school. Yes, yes.

313
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,496
Those were the days, eh, Alva?

314
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,654
So... Why...?
Why do you have your coat on?

315
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,654
Well, I'm leaving. It's five o'clock.

316
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,257
But you still haven't found
that contract yet, have you?

317
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,732
There are 15 De Spiege files.
It's all I do all day. I mean...

318
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,733
But you haven't found it yet, Alva.

319
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,691
Don't you think it would be
a good idea to stay late?

320
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,057
- Maybe work a little overtime?
- My eyes are killing me.

321
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,775
Ah...

322
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,736
I was thinking today

323
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,098
that maybe you could put
somebody else on the job for a while.

324
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,899
Or another secretary to help me out.

325
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,257
I mean, you know,
to make the job easier.

326
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,096
Alva.

327
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,576
There is no one else
in this entire office

328
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,779
that I could possibly ask
to share such a horrible job.

329
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,659
You're the lowest
on the totem pole here, Alva.

330
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,130
The lowest. Do you realise that?

331
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,693
Every other secretary has been here
longer than you, Alva. Every one.

332
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,293
Even if there was someone here

333
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,974
who was here just one day
longer than you,

334
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,416
I wouldn't ask that person
to partake in such a miserable job

335
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,969
as long as you were around.

336
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,895
That's right, Alva.
It's a horrible, horrible job.

337
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,814
Sifting through old contract
after old contract.

338
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,052
I couldn't think of a more
horrible job if I wanted to.

339
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,973
And you have to do it. You have to.

340
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,496
Or I'll fire you.
Do you understand?

341
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,616
Do you?

342
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,815
Yes.

343
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,538
Good.

344
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,379
Then there's no problem, then.
Is there?

345
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,531
Don't you wanna use your gun, Alva?

346
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,100
Hey. Here you go.

347
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,334
Hey, man, you forgot your food.

348
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,770
I hate interrupted love affairs.

349
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,408
How much nicer when the outside world

350
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,538
doesn't interfere with the pleasure.

351
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,093
You were so right to put yourself
into my hands, Peter.

352
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,048
The only one who can put you
out of your misery.

353
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,293
Tell me how much
you love me, my angel.

354
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,611
Whisper it to me. Just once.

355
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,736
Please...

356
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,654
Just once. Oh, just once.

357
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,695
I know you do.
I can read your mind, my love.

358
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,533
I can see it in your actions.

359
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,455
You can't get through the day
without thinking about me, can you?

360
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,976
Tell me you love me.

361
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,571
- Tell me.
- Yes. Yes.

362
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,295
- Tell me how much you love me.
- Yes.

363
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,052
Tell me.

364
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,939
I love you.

365
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,534
I love you.

366
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,014
I love you.

367
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,055
That was so clever of you. "Mescaline"?

368
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,613
How did you ever think of that?

369
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:43,457
Oh, but why should I be so surprised?

370
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,169
My little literary genius.

371
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,975
I knew you could keep
our passion a secret.

372
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,772
Sweet dreams, my angel.

373
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,054
Huh? What's that?

374
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:44,539
Wanna join me? Well, absolutely, love.

375
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,698
Watch your step.

376
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,977
Come on, now. Don't do that.
I have to go to work.

377
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,608
Stop it now. Come on!

378
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,059
Thank God it's Friday,
that's all I've got to say.

379
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,775
All I'm gonna do this weekend
is stay home and sleep.

380
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,249
This place is driving me crazy.

381
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,934
- Morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

382
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,492
I wonder what Alva's doing today.

383
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,574
- Yes, Mr Loew?
- Would you send Alva in here?

384
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,459
- She called in sick today, Mr Loew.
- Did she?

385
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,975
She said she had a very bad cold.

386
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,894
- A bad cold. Thank s, Judy.
- Mm-hm.

387
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,732
A bad cold.

388
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,653
My, my, my.

389
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,055
I'm not going to work today, Mummy!
My boss is a bastard

390
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,373
Don't use that kind of language
in front of me.

391
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,816
Well, it's true. I hate him.

392
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,494
Yes. "I hate him. " "I hate him. "

393
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:41,688
What do you think?
That's an excuse not to go to work?

394
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,499
You know how many people
hate their boss?

395
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,575
I hate my boss,
but do I stay home and cry about it?

396
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,777
- I know, Mummy, but...
- Listen, young lady.

397
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,896
You can't afford to lose that job.

398
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,210
You'll get no more money
from your father and me.

399
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,610
- I'll just get another job.
- I'm late.

400
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,058
Now, get dressed
and get your little ass into the city.

401
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,176
No
Now!

402
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,172
What are you doing here?

403
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,491
What, Alva? I can hardly hear you
through this window.

404
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,255
- What are you doing here?
- I heard you were sick.

405
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,012
A terrible cold.

406
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,296
- I'm calling the police.
- The police?

407
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,294
Alva, I'm here to call a truce, man. Look...

408
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,009
I just took a 20-dollar taxi ride
so I could tell you

409
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,172
I think it was wrong
the way I treated you yesterday.

410
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,808
Is that an elaborate gesture or what?

411
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,778
Plus, look. Soup.

412
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,972
Hi.

413
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,532
I stayed till one in the morning,
and I still couldn't find the contract.

414
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,373
Alva, don't worry about it.
It's understandable.

415
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,169
I know how worried you were
about losing Mr Heatherton as a client.

416
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:05,652
Alva, right now
what's most important is your health.

417
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,814
Well, I'm... You see,
I'm not really sick, Mr Loew.

418
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,929
I was just afraid to go back
to the office without the contract.

419
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,819
Alva, I had a feeling
that was the case.

420
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,494
And that's why I came
all the way up here.

421
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,936
- It's my fault you feel that way.
- Oh, no, no, no.

422
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,534
I know you're trying to run
an efficient office.

423
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,658
That may be,
but some things just take time.

424
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,654
Hey, Alva. The way I feel is,
the hell with Frank Heatherton.

425
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,733
If he wants to go to another agency, fine.
So, what do you say?

426
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,858
Do you wanna come to work?

427
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,935
Door to door service, madam. On me.

428
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,812
Truce?

429
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,938
OK. Truce.

430
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,013
Just give me a few minutes.
I'll be right back.

431
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,970
It's horrible when there are tensions
between employer and employee.

432
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,452
Sometimes the pressures,
you know, they just build up.

433
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,976
Wait till you get into
a position of authority.

434
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,849
Yeah... Well, I mean, if I ever do.

435
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,490
You will, Alva.
You're a very bright girl.

436
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,776
That's how I know that today, by God,

437
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,809
is the day you're gonna find
that damned Heatherton contract.

438
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,177
I... I thought you said
that you didn't care

439
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,695
if Mr Heatherton left the agency.

440
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,569
I thought you said
that everything took time.

441
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,254
That doesn't mean
we're gonna stop trying to do

442
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,729
the best damn job we can.

443
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,653
The work's not just gonna go away, Alva

444
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,857
It never just goes away.

445
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:24,174
That goddam contract is somewhere
in those goddam fucking files!

446
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:33,933
- Are you all right, Mr Loew?
- Shut up, bitch.

447
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,371
Mr Loew...

448
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,532
I was supposed to give some money
to my brother

449
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,898
and he works in
that gas station over there.

450
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,416
- Is it OK if we stop for a second?
- Yes. Go.

451
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,298
Emilio?

452
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,530
- Hey.
- Come to the back.

453
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,214
Hey. Don't take it so hard, sis.

454
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,259
If you got the time to lean,
you got the time to clean.

455
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,139
Old man Randolph.
He throws fits all the time.

456
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,452
Listen to me, OK? This guy is very weird.
I'm telling you.

457
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,258
You all right?

458
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,778
That's my baby.

459
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,852
Your... wife?

460
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,818
50 years. Keeps me going.

461
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,815
There is work and there is love.
I'm right?

462
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,689
You are married man?

463
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,293
Emilio.

464
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,891
Remember this?
I want you to give me bullets for it.

465
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,130
Put that away. Are you crazy?

466
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,770
No. You gave it to me.
What good is it if I can't use it?

467
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,330
What's good is it'll scare the shit
out of any motherfucker

468
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,298
comes close enough to spit on you.

469
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,258
You ain't even supposed
to be carrying this thing around.

470
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,412
Please? I'm asking you, Emilio.

471
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,093
Where is that little cunt?

472
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,698
Look...

473
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,254
Randolph don't even
keep real bullets in his gun.

474
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,092
No? What about the robbery?

475
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,616
- When those pigs came here to rob?
- He scared them off with blank s.

476
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:47,889
- All he has here is blank s, Alva.
- OK, then give me the fucking blank s.

477
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,929
Fine.

478
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,209
44.50 only.

479
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,178
Fucking clean me right out!

480
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,097
Crazy Jews...

481
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:01,218
I just shelled out almost 50 buck s
to get you back here, Alva.

482
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,537
You better hope
you make it worth it to me.

483
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,938
Oh, Christ. Oh, Christ. Where am I?

484
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,931
Where am I? Oh, Christ!
Where am I?

485
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,053
I've become one. A vampire. Oh, god!

486
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,537
Oh, God, where am I?

487
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,658
You're in the crapper,
Loew, and I'm taking a dump.

488
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,575
So leave the acting lessons for home
or go back to the ladies room.

489
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,414
Arthur Hesse on O1, Mr Loew.

490
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,573
Tell him I'm out. Tell anyone who calls
I'm out. I'm in a meeting.

491
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,018
- Are you all right, Mr Loew?
- Tell him I'm in a meeting.

492
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,335
It's impossible.

493
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,014
It can't be.

494
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:52,298
It's impossible. It can't be.

495
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,412
Mr Loew? I found the contract.

496
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,735
Mr Loew, I found it!

497
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,250
Mr Loew?

498
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,256
Mr Loew? I found the contract.

499
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,494
I never found the right woman, that's all.
I never found the right woman.

500
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,418
There's work
and there's love. I'm right?

501
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,972
Mr Loew?

502
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,769
I found the contract.

503
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,736
Mr, I finally found...

504
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,057
Well... it's just

505
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,371
too late, Alva.

506
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,089
- But why is it too late?
- It's too late, Alva.

507
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,935
- It's not too late.
- Too late. Too late.

508
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,979
- It's not too late.
- Too late. Too late.

509
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,813
- Stay away!
- Too late. It's too late, Alva.

510
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,540
It's all too late, Alva. Come here.

511
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,930
- Come here, Alva.
- Stay away!

512
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,418
Stay away!

513
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,613
- Do it.
- I will.

514
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,135
- Do it.
- I swear to God I will.

515
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,860
Alva, do it or I'll fire you.
Understand?

516
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:44,377
- Unemployment. Can you live with that?
- Oh, please...

517
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,337
- Do it, goddammit!
- Please, don't rape me.

518
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,288
Rape you? I will. Come on, Alva

519
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,973
Shoot.

520
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,936
Not the floor, Alva. Me!

521
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,499
Stay away!

522
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,252
Me. Me!

523
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,651
Damn it. Help me. Help me!

524
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,380
Shoot me. Me. Me!

525
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,373
- You're fired!
- God!

526
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,057
God!

527
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,938
You're with me now, angel.

528
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,810
Hey...

529
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,570
Hey. I'm a vampire.

530
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,300
A real vampire.

531
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:06,018
I'm a vampire!
I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!

532
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:11,049
I'm a vampire!
I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!

533
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,415
I'm hungry.

534
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:00,014
Well, well.

535
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,809
You're with me now.

536
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,369
You're completely with me.

537
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,734
You're like me now, my angel.

538
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:26,169
You know what you have to do.

539
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,930
Alva?
What's the matter with you?

540
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,898
Come on, now.
Breakfast is on the table.

541
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,938
Leave me alone.

542
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,499
Alva?

543
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,896
Alva?

544
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:10,251
Don't know.
She don't want to get out of bed.

545
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,331
She's tired, I guess.

546
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,129
- Did she go out last night?
- I don't know.

547
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:21,420
She didn't get in that late.
She went right into her room.

548
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,178
Alvy?

549
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,296
Alvy, are you awake?

550
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,736
Alva?

551
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,050
You all right?

552
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,894
Go away.

553
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:18,818
Yeah, well, I'll be at the station today,
you want to talk.

554
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,615
Yeah, well I'll see you.

555
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:39,454
Fucking bastards!

556
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,409
We just got these in.

557
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,017
Now, these are fibreglass.
Very lifelike.

558
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,254
See the way they colour them?

559
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,810
Just a little touch of yellow,
so they blend in better.

560
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,131
- How much?
- Those are 19.95.

561
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:28,819
What's the matter?

562
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,936
Do you have anything for less?

563
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,977
Oh, sure.

564
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:37,770
I got some cheapie plastic ones.
They're only 3.50.

565
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,498
Cheapie...

566
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:44,292
- I will take the plastic.
- OK.

567
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,254
- Hello?
- Hello, Dr Glaser?

568
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,049
This is Peter Loew. Peter Loew.

569
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,412
Yes, Peter, how are you?

570
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,334
I wonder if I could make
my next appointment with you sooner.

571
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:53,172
I'd really like to make it sooner.

572
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,808
Well, let's see...

573
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:59,416
My next appointment with you
is Tuesday afternoon, right?

574
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,730
I'd like to make it sooner.

575
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,494
I'm open on Tuesday morning.
How's that?

576
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,649
Sooner.

577
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,493
Uh-huh. Peter, do you have a cold?

578
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,969
- A cold. Yeah.
- OK.

579
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,576
Look. I could squeeze you in on
Monday afternoon. Can you make that?

580
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,219
Oh, sooner...

581
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:20,453
- Peter, is it something very urgent?
- Very urgent, yes.

582
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,493
- All right.
- Hurry up, honey.

583
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,730
I'll tell you what.

584
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,939
Why don't you come in on Monday morning
and I'll come in early?

585
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,453
7.30, all right?

586
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,690
7.30.

587
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,852
- Monday morning.
- That's right.

588
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,694
7.30, Monday morning.

589
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,897
I'm sorry.

590
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,339
Very anti-social, Peter.

591
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,459
Extremely anti-social behaviour.

592
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,932
My, my goood hoess

593
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,332
However are you going to continue this way?

594
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,730
Rachel.

595
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:28,414
Are you actually going to
go through with this every night?

596
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,810
I can do it.

597
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,972
I know I can do it now.

598
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,210
I'm like you. Remember?

599
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,536
Peter. You are so pathetic.

600
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,653
This?

601
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,530
I love you.

602
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,815
I like you.

603
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,050
You disgust me, Peter.

604
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:03,489
- You're with me.
- Don't touch me.

605
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:08,609
- You are with me.
- Well, it doesn't look like it.

606
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:11,214
Does it, Donald?

607
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,450
No.

608
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,298
Doesn't appear that way, does it?

609
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,133
Doesn't appear that way at all.

610
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:27,215
I love you. You can't just walk away.

611
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:30,929
You don't know
what you're doing, damn it!

612
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,933
I said I love you.

613
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:01,699
Hey, buddy!

614
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:05,011
You don't remember me?
You don't remember me?

615
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,490
- Peter, right?
- Yes, right. Peter. Right!

616
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:12,414
- Well, how are you?
- How am I?

617
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:14,935
- Get off!
- Buddy, calm down!

618
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,812
Let go of me, you fuck!

619
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:24,017
- You see her teeth?
- Shut up.

620
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:27,172
- She's a goddam vampire!
- No!

621
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,892
You fucking cunt!

622
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,779
You're breaking up with me

623
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:40,570
after I sucked that broad bone-dry.

624
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:46,370
Look at her teeth, all of you.
She's a goddam vampire!

625
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:50,135
She made me one, too.
Look at her teeth.

626
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,737
Look at her teeth.
She's a goddam vampire!

627
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,492
She made me one, too!

628
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,173
Stay out.

629
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:02,810
You see, I know I am. I'm a vampire.

630
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:06,177
I can prove it.
You got a gun? You got a gun?

631
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:08,649
Get the fuck off me!

632
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:12,699
No! Don't... Please.

633
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,851
Better get back in your coffin, buddy.

634
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,976
The sun's almost up.

635
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,576
You're just a high school cunt.

636
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:28,097
I don't believe I really loved her,
but she's a cunt, a high school...

637
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,292
No! No sun.

638
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,339
Christ!

639
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,456
This is the end.

640
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,092
I can't take it any more!

641
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,854
Go ahead. Kill me!

642
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,370
Hey, what's doing?

643
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,616
Hey.

644
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:03,736
What's wrong?

645
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,899
Oh, God...

646
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,736
Hey, hey.

647
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,129
Hey, now. Hey, hey.

648
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,259
What's the matter, baby? Huh?

649
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,139
What's the matter?

650
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,053
Tell me. Tell me.

651
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,774
Tell me what happened.

652
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,851
My girlfriend broke up with me.

653
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:25,571
I'm a vampire. Kill me. Kill me.

654
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:48,251
Your rosary beads... Take them out
and put the cross up to me like this.

655
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,935
- I no speak the English.
- The cross. The crucifix.

656
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,613
Me vampire!

657
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,340
Vampire, you idiot. Nosferatu.

658
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,379
Christ!

659
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:04,738
The tortures of the damned!

660
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:43,449
Get the hell out of my way!

661
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,339
Are you crazy?

662
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:10,095
All right. Just tell me
when you see him.

663
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,694
Sorry, I forgot. Where did we leave off?

664
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:40,172
Well, Peter, you wanted to make
an earlier appointment,

665
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,058
so what's up?

666
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,734
I've been thinking about
my depressions very seriously,

667
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:47,255
and frankly I just don't think
you can help me.

668
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:50,730
I think your profession
is entirely bogus. Entirely.

669
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,731
From my point of view, that is.

670
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,173
You really think so?

671
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:58,696
Yes, I do. I've been spending
a lot of money here

672
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:02,057
and I just think
it's time for a change.

673
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:06,372
A change? What exactly
did you have in mind for yourself?

674
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,612
- Don't laugh.
- I'm a professional. I don't laugh.

675
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:16,069
- Um... love.
- Love?

676
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:19,461
Yes, baby, real love.

677
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:23,066
The sweep-me-off-my-feet.

678
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:25,380
The big L.

679
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:27,943
What?

680
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:33,709
No, I'm not talking about
fairy-tale love.

681
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:37,146
I'm talking about
a mature relationship.

682
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:40,268
What do you think, I'm a kid?

683
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,267
I know what you're thinking.

684
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:48,423
You're thinking, "Let's see him go out
in the jungle and try to find love. "

685
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:50,945
"He'll come crawling back here
in no time. "

686
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:54,386
I know it isn't easy,
but I know it's possible.

687
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:56,780
Hell, I see it around me every day.

688
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,908
Do you know how horrible it is
to see it around you every day?

689
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:03,585
Do you know
what kind of torture that is?

690
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,627
I'll find it, goddammit.

691
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:08,099
I'll find it for myself,

692
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:12,183
and then I'll be happy.
Holy shit, then I'll be happy.

693
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:23,067
You said you wouldn't laugh.

694
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:25,824
I am...

695
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,265
It... I'm sorry.

696
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:32,708
I'm only laugh... laughing because...

697
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:37,864
If you had told me,
if you had just told the good doctor,

698
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:40,498
the time you could have saved.

699
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,423
The money the both of you
could have saved.

700
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:46,104
Both of us? Both of us?

701
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,503
What do you mean the both of us?

702
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,028
You and Sharon.

703
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,226
- Sharon?
- Yes.

704
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:57,099
The patient who comes in after you.

705
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:02,469
She complains of exactly
the same thing you do and...

706
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:07,658
...personality-wise, I think
you two are made for each other.

707
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:09,502
- Really?
- Oh!

708
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:12,423
I should have matched you two up
long ago.

709
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:16,139
Hey, I think she's here now.

710
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,870
I'll just go and check.

711
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,985
Sharon.

712
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:31,427
What a beautiful name.

713
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:34,582
It's incredible.

714
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,900
It's really incredible.

715
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:48,101
Sharon. This is Peter Loew.

716
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:50,147
- Hi.
- Hi.

717
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,505
I like poetry, horseback-riding,

718
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:55,946
Vivaldi and long weekends
in the country.

719
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:59,739
Those are exactly the same things
that I like.

720
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,628
Wait a minute.

721
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:04,224
"We walked along,
While bright and red

722
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:06,460
Uprose the rising sun"

723
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:09,667
- Wordsworth.
- Incredible.

724
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:12,469
Wow!

725
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,064
I guess you two
won't be needing me any more.

726
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:18,666
I guess not. Thank you, Dr Glaser.
This one's going to last. I can tell.

727
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:21,822
- It was written in the stars.
- Written in the stars, yes.

728
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:26,381
- Do you like Japanese food?
- It's the best. So refreshing.

729
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,348
Did you see that?
We're on exactly the same wavelength.

730
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,978
Fantastic.

731
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:35,187
So long, Dr Glaser.

732
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,219
Oh, I almost forgot.

733
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,744
Yes, Peter?

734
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:46,868
Well, I did rape someone
a couple of nights ago.

735
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,260
A girl at the office.
I just lost control.

736
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:52,388
It's just a little id release.
No use to worry.

737
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:54,506
Phew!

738
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:59,502
I just thought I should tell you, OK?

739
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:02,662
It's a load off my mind.

740
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:05,060
Oh, yeah...

741
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:07,822
Also, I...

742
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:09,787
Just spit it out, Peter.

743
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:15,145
Well, the fact is
I did murder someone last night.

744
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,824
I turned into a vampire.
It's a long story.

745
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:19,582
Goodness.

746
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:25,302
Peter, people get murdered every day.
Do you think the world is going to stop?

747
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,542
I guess, but the police and everything.
What if they find me?

748
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:32,908
Would you stop worrying
and just get on with your big romance.

749
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:36,824
He hasn't even been arrested
and the big lug is carrying on.

750
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:40,266
Get out of here, the both of you.
Have a wonderful life together

751
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,466
and I will take care of the cops.

752
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,986
Get out, both of you.
Out, out, out. Shh! Shh!

753
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:50,541
Thank you very much, Dr Glaser.

754
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:52,666
You are a gem.

755
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:56,389
Come on, Sharon.

756
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:02,465
Do you like that tune? Yeah.

757
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,303
Actually, I live up right around here.

758
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:09,145
Do you wanna come up?
You can join me. OK.

759
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:13,863
Well, I was born in Philadelphia,

760
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:18,262
but I've been a New Yorker now
for going on ten years.

761
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,421
And what about you?

762
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:22,228
Ah, nice.

763
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:25,746
I hear it's very beautiful country
up there.

764
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:30,220
What? This?

765
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:36,421
It's like I started saying before,
I turned into a vampire last week.

766
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:40,708
It's all in the past, though.
You OK? You know...

767
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,066
There he is.

768
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,425
I don't wanna talk about it any more.

769
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,707
It's all from
a very unhappy period in my life

770
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,781
and I don't wanna talk about it.

771
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:59,703
End of subject, OK?

772
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,987
Sharon...

773
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:07,699
Goddammit, what did I just say?

774
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:27,790
You don't let up, do you, cunt?

775
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:33,308
You just keep harping and harping
over the same goddam thing.

776
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,506
"Why did you become a vampire?"

777
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:37,467
"Why couldn't you be normal?"

778
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,939
"Peter, does this mean
we can never have children?"

779
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:56,221
...'cause there's no way in hell

780
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,540
that I would ever, ever marry

781
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:01,861
a loud-mouth pig like you.

782
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:06,387
In the ten minutes I'm with you
and the shit just starts right up.

783
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:09,747
What? What?

784
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,981
You hate my guts?

785
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:16,904
You wanna go home?
You wanna leave? Good. Fine.

786
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,858
Get the hell out of here,
you fucking pig!

787
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:40,420
Leave me the fuck alone!

788
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,823
I really can't handle
these relationships.

789
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:47,981
Maybe I should see a shrink.

790
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:10,509
Get up.

791
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:13,939
Get up, motherfucker!

792
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:19,980
Dream of me, my angel.

793
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,106
Dream of me.

794
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:15,627
Dream of me, my angel.

795
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:21,143
Dream of me.
