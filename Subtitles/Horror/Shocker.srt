Are you saying
that Pinker is alive somehow?

706
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:06,390
And he just jumps in and out of people
like a goddamn crab or something?

707
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:09,810
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's exactly what he's doing.

708
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:13,856
Maybe he's using electricity or something
because of the way he died, I don't know.

709
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:18,026
All I do know is that
I saw him do it five times today.

- And break his neck.

- You can't do it that directly, Rhino

- Then we'll break his neck.
- It doesn't work that way, Coach.

717
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:45,179
You don't force him out of the body until
he's used up the life of the body he's in.
