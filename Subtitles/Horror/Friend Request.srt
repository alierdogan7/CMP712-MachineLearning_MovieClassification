Subtitle Re-Synced to this release by SubSync.net

2
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,298
Everyone please.

3
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,041
Please.

4
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:40,424
It's my unfortunate responsibility
to share with you some terrible news.

5
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:44,386
It seems that over the weekend

6
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:48,086
your fellow student, Marina Mills,
committed suicide.

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,558
Is it true that she filmed it on her web-cam?

8
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,696
One of your classmates died,
and all you care about is whether you can see it?

9
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:13,649
There was a video uploaded to the university
website this morning.

10
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:15,755
Some of you were crafty enough

11
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,622
to grab it before we could take it down.

12
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,833
I urge you not to watch it.

13
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:25,535
Anyone caught sharing it
will be suspended - period.

14
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,900
No discussion.

15
00:01:29,444 --> 00:01:32,508
Are any of you friends with Marina?

16
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:38,920
Or have any info that could shed light
on this tragedy,

17
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,579
If so, see me after class.

18
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,418
Liv, this video is so cute!

19
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:25,271
- So not scary.
- Right.

20
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,116
That was so good.

21
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,386
Hey.

22
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

23
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,548
- Hey. - Hello...
Someone didn't come home last night!

24
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,018
Yeah, again.

25
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:19,469
- So are you like monogamous now?
- Liv, it's not a dirty word. Jesus!

26
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,952
I know, I'm just jealous...
for being dumped.

27
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:25,652
You were not dumped.
You knew him for one day.

28
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,143
It was an amazing day!

29
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:52,913
So you're in a relationship?

30
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,581
Here we go...

31
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,302
No, it's super cool. Really.
I just...

32
00:04:57,657 --> 00:05:01,619
love all these precious updates
about you and Dr. Surfboard.

33
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,902
- Good for you.
- Oh shut up!

34
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:19,425
Another argument why internet addiction disorder
doesn't belong in the DSM

35
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:22,897
is that it's frequently
symptomatic of other disorders:

36
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,430
depression, anxiety, trauma.

37
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,735
Often it's an escape from things
we don't want to deal with.

38
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,937
From our everyday lives
to things far, far worse.

39
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,815
But the most common disorder might just be
that we have too much time on our hands.

40
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,514
Play it cool.

41
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,422
Wait a few days.

42
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:43,424
He already knows I'm not cool.

43
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:48,730
I think we might have an excellent
example of internet addiction disorder

44
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,836
right here in class.

45
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:55,330
Besides from Miss Woodson and Miss Matheson...

46
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:59,094
Does anyone else here experience symptoms?

47
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:05,796
- I love it!
- I like that.

48
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:08,330
- And this is good.
- I really like that filter.

49
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,342
I can show you how to do it.

50
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:15,232
- Look at Kobe.
- Jesus. When's he going to get over you?

51
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:18,391
- He's such a creeper.
- He is not a creeper!

52
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:23,373
- Who is that?
- That girl in my class.

53
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,314
Zero friends sounds like super-weird.

54
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:29,910
Maybe she just started her profile or something.

55
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,289
Is she like 12 years old?

56
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:48,258
Ha.

57
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,062
She's really talented.

58
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,259
I like it.

59
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:05,940
- You like it when she rips her hair out during class?
- Come on.

60
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,629
I literally saw her pull an eyelash out today.

61
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,027
It's a condition called trichotillomania.

62
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,489
You would know about it if you
cracked open a textbook once in a while.

63
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:16,438
- Owned!
- Oh well, whatever...

64
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:20,369
- I'm actually changing majors next year.
- And the year after that?

65
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:24,164
- Ow! Two-fer!
- Whatever!

66
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,230
What are you cooking? Seafood curry?

67
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:54,040
My dad was a psychiatrist,
so I guess I want to follow in his footsteps.

68
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:55,729
That's nice.

69
00:08:56,177 --> 00:09:00,139
Are you doing it for credit,
or do you really just want to do it?

70
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:01,931
I'm not sure.

71
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,840
I just transferred.

72
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,551
- I don't know anyone yet.
- Well, now you know me.

73
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,273
Are you in the dorms?

74
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,818
My friends and I just got an apartment.
It's amazing...

75
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,914
But we're definitely not getting any work done.

76
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,375
- Too many friends.
- Exactly.

77
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,702
I'll see you around campus.

78
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:30,590
Bye Laura.

79
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:50,304
- I thought med students had homework.
- You're one to talk.

80
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:53,651
Well I'm studying - Internet Addiction Disorder.

81
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:56,258
- And you're your own case study.
- Exactly.

82
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,252
What's the deal with this girl?

83
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:07,444
I don't know. I think she's lonely.

84
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:14,189
Is she your friend
or your first mental patient?

85
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:18,025
She'll be my second mental patient.

86
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,895
She's going through every post
I've ever made in my life.

87
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:44,720
Wow! She's crazy.

88
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,431
- Look what she just sent me.
- I want to see.

89
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,437
Oh.

90
00:12:56,938 --> 00:13:00,576
It looks like you guys are going
to live happily ever after together.

91
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:01,932
Oh my God!

92
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,497
- Who is this person?
- I don't know.

93
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:07,749
Scroll down. I want to see her time-line.

94
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,367
Further.

95
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,954
Further.

96
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,935
Jesus!

97
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:43,497
No wonder this girl's giving you nightmares!

98
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:47,928
Close this.

99
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,535
Oh my God.

100
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:55,204
Laura, this girl isn't right.
Why are you hanging out with her?

101
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:57,091
I was just trying to be nice.

102
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:00,688
I can't believe you invited her to your birthday!

103
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,232
No, I did not invite her. She invited herself.

104
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:07,006
- What was I supposed to say?
- How about something like "Fuck no!"

105
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,738
Yeah, that sounds about right to me.

106
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:12,980
- Well you can't say that to someone.
- Yes you can.

107
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,658
It goes like this:

108
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:16,722
- Hey Laura, can I come to your birthday?
- Fuck no!

109
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,463
There you go.

110
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:57,256
Laura, finally! Happy Birthday.
You look so pretty!

111
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:58,632
Thanks, Marina.

112
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:02,468
- Did you get my messages?
- Yes, how could I miss them?

113
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,755
Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?

114
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:12,101
No, I'm not mad at you, I'm just...

115
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:13,936
I'll see you in class tomorrow, OK?

116
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,438
But what about tonight?

117
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,909
Aren't you celebrating with your friends?

118
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:24,299
Uh... It's just Tyler and I tonight.
We're going out to dinner. So...

119
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,217
It's just the two of us.

120
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,755
But you barely know her.
It's just tonight it's you and your friends.

121
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:37,383
I know, I just feel icky lying about it.

122
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:40,750
Well, you don't look very icky to me.

123
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,160
Go on.

124
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:51,175
- Laura! Hooray!
- Hi! Happy Birthday!

125
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:53,594
- Hi, Mom!
- Happy Birthday!

126
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:56,325
- Very nice.
- Pleased to meet you.

127
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:57,034
Hey.

128
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:58,640
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.

129
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,987
I've been trying to get your mom
as drunk as possible.

130
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:04,030
And so you, beautiful guy,
you need to get drunk with me

131
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,636
so we know your secrets.

132
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:41,154
Yea!

133
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:49,192
And the last reason - no matter what

134
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:52,174
you'll always find a way
to make me feel better.

135
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,227
Wait, wait, wait.

136
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:58,460
To my little green bean
who makes me so proud every day.

137
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:03,068
And who made your father so proud
every single second.

138
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,278
Oh, Mom.

139
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:12,190
- Get in. I'm coming in this little love boat.
- No, please.

140
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,192
I'm going. I'm going.

141
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,893
This is to us... a wonderful evening.

142
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:22,188
To the future... to success.

143
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:24,294
And you shut up, you drunk floozy.

144
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:27,150
And this is also just to you. Happy Birthday!

145
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,818
- Cheers!
- Thank you,

146
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:41,829
- Hi, Laura. How are you doing?
- Hey! How are you?

147
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,945
- Good.
- That's good.

148
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,585
I thought we were friends.

149
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,889
Marina, what are you talking about?

150
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,350
I saw you with everyone. Your birthday dinner.
I saw it.

151
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,124
Marina, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

152
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,751
Can we talk about this later?

153
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,025
I had a present for you,
I worked on it for two weeks.

154
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:09,028
Two weeks?
You've barley known me for two weeks.

155
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,478
You're a fucking liar just like everyone else!

156
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:15,138
Why did you accept my friend request?
You didn't have to do that!

157
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:17,901
- Get the fuck off me!
- Do you have any idea what it's like to be alone?

158
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:21,644
- Do not leave me alone!
- Get off me you bitch!

159
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:39,335
Laura, you didn't do anything wrong.
That chick is just damaged.

160
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:42,317
You weren't there, Tyler.

161
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,141
It's not your fault.

162
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:50,688
Baby, I'm really sorry. I've got to get
back to cutting up dead people.

163
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:51,970
Okay.

164
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,902
She's trying to face chat me.
What do I do?

165
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,299
Don't take the call.

166
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,425
Seriously.

167
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,032
Fine, alright. I'll talk to you later.

168
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:04,762
Okay. Bye.

169
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,360
Liv?

170
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:58,022
Hmm.

171
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,689
Are you okay?

172
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,038
Go to bed.

173
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:00,488
Please. Everyone, please.

174
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:10,455
It's my unfortunate responsibility to share
with you some terrible news.

175
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:16,271
It seems that over the weekend your fellow
student, Marina Mills, committed suicide.

176
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,262
How'd it go?

177
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,035
Fine.

178
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:36,205
I just told them she was stalking me
and totally crazy.

179
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:39,572
Hey, don't beat yourself up about it.

180
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,605
That girl was totally nuts.

181
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:45,775
- She needed help though.
- Yeah, like serious help.

182
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,308
Not from a sophomore in psych 201.

183
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,687
Look on the bright side. Might be able
to get out of class for the funeral.

184
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,377
No, there's not going to be a funeral,
there's no body.

185
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:56,910
What do you mean?

186
00:23:57,462 --> 00:24:00,870
Uh... The cops were at my dorm this morning.

187
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:03,602
And they don't know where she did it.
But it wasn't there.

188
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:07,095
She hasn't swiped her key card
since last weekend.

189
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,336
But what freaks me out is...

190
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,088
they don't even know who this girl was.

191
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:17,760
Her contact info, her social security it's all
been deleted from the school database.

192
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,888
They don't even think that Marina Mills
was her real name.

193
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:23,723
Are you serious?

194
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,686
- That's really weird.
- I can't eat my cheeseburger now.

195
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,446
- Oh my God!
-  What's going on?

196
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,023
Why are you watching this?

197
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:52,922
- Who sent this crap?
- She did.

198
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:55,152
- She's dead!
- I know!

199
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,540
Again you have 60 minutes.
This is an actual case study.

200
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,604
A challenging one.

201
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:47,227
Oh my God.

202
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:53,607
God.

203
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:55,828
Is that the video?

204
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:59,018
I thought you said it was in your messages.
You posted it?

205
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,706
No, no. Someone did. I didn't.

206
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:04,845
And they tagged all my friends.

207
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,153
Laptops away Miss Woodson.

208
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,845
Why would they think I did that.
I would never do that.

209
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:22,444
- Did you try changing your password?
- Yes, yes, I tried everything.

210
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,458
She's even back in my friends list.

211
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,679
Unfriend that dead bitch!

212
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:37,716
I can't!

213
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:41,970
So according to you Miss Woodson,
the video just magically

214
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,181
appeared on your time-line this morning.
Do I have that right?

215
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:47,078
Why would I do this?

216
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:53,458
There must be some reason why this girl
burned that picture of you.

217
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:56,920
Look, Laura. We know that you're a great student,

218
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,901
But multiple students reported you
harassing Marina.

219
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,217
No, she was the one harassing me.

220
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,845
She was obsessed with me.

221
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:10,264
Laura, no one's saying it's your fault
that Marina took her life.

222
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:16,196
We're looking into everything. But in
the meantime, if you can't delete that video...

223
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,594
You're going to have to delete your profile.

224
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,848
Hey, one more thing. Any idea where
this girl might have torched herself?

225
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,768
No.

226
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:29,051
No, you're not listening to me!

227
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:32,553
I can't delete this video!
I can't even delete my account!

228
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:34,940
Like I said, this isn't a call center.

229
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,088
OK, but what about the dead girl
I can't unfriend.

230
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:39,048
Can you do something about that?

231
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:43,072
- I'm not seeing that account.
- What? I just saw it!

232
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:50,131
- Is there anyone else I can speak to?
- They'll just tell you the same thing.

233
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:55,697
What's next?

234
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,230
Kobe, I know you're in there.
I can hear your stupid game.

235
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,070
That was a nice video you posted.

236
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,582
Well that's what I'm here about.

237
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,901
Wow.

238
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,353
You're her only friend. How special is that?

239
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,698
Shut up,

240
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,659
Christ, someone's still uploading things..

241
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:52,380
That's intense!

242
00:29:55,455 --> 00:29:56,863
I fucking love it!

243
00:29:57,801 --> 00:30:00,876
Oh, alright. Let's take a little peek
behind the curtain.

244
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:12,386
- What?
- You have no idea how crazy that is, do you?

245
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,658
Okay.

246
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,360
Look at that. That is what code
normally looks like.

247
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,259
Not this.

248
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,981
I can't even copy this.
This isn't code.

249
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,181
Well... what is it?

250
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:33,163
I don't know.

251
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,511
Wait. Can you go back?

252
00:30:46,424 --> 00:30:50,323
Stop looking at that girl's profile.
Stop thinking about her.

253
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,847
She killed herself. End of story.

254
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:58,465
She burned and hung herself
in front of her laptop.

255
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,467
Who does that?

256
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:05,179
Is this going to be a thing now?
You and Kobe hanging out in his dorm?

257
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:09,046
- Is that really what you're thinking about right now?
- Yeah.

258
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,091
I'm thinking about us. What's wrong with that?

259
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,158
- He's just a friend. You know that.
- Does he?

260
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:28,449
It's called cyber-stalking for a reason.

261
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:30,721
They can't bother you if you're not online.

262
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:59,140
Yeah, get me some of those chocolate
macadamia crisp things.

263
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,603
No, they're not chocolate potato chips,
they're like... cookies.

264
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:08,919
or like crackers. Just ask the guy there.
I go there all the time.

265
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:11,203
The white chubby kid who loves chocolate.

266
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:14,747
You're not chubby, You're being fussy.
My God!

267
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:18,927
I'm not being fussy. I'm on my period
and chocolate makes me feel better.

268
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,347
Isabelle?

269
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:24,932
Hello?

270
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,039
Shit.

271
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,076
Jen?

272
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,308
Hello?

273
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:01,994
Kobe?

274
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:11,679
Guys, this isn't funny.

275
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,775
Seriously!

276
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,311
Guys?

277
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:37,263
Kobes, come on man!

278
00:33:52,212 --> 00:33:54,621
What the hell?

279
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:34,399
No!

280
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:04,226
Okay, so... she's barely talking right now.

281
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:08,583
We're gonna keep her overnight. Maybe longer.

282
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:10,855
You can see her if you want.

283
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,319
Listen...

284
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:19,582
... I didn't know Gustavo that well.

285
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,720
Was he on something?

286
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:25,285
No.

287
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:29,351
I saw the medical report. It was insane.

288
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:47,198
Please, just leave.

289
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:48,940
Sweetheart...

290
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,505
This is all her fault.

291
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:54,256
She's not herself, Laura.

292
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,061
No, Gus wasn't himself.

293
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,626
He was having nightmares.

294
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:02,940
So am I.

295
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:05,599
You're scaring us Is.
What are you talking about?

296
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,257
Laura knows!

297
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,677
She knows.

298
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,528
It doesn't feel real.

299
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:59,227
Promise me you won't look at
that girl's profile today.

300
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,029
You're driving yourself crazy.

301
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:52,228
Delete your account!

302
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:54,219
Seriously.

303
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:56,263
You want Isabelle to see that?

304
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:59,537
- Liv you know I can't!
- I don't care how.

305
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,497
Just do it.

306
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:07,523
Fuck.

307
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:57,407
Even if it's not you behind these posts, I'm
getting a lot of pressure from the students.

308
00:40:58,429 --> 00:41:00,566
As long as the posts are up
I have no choice...

309
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:03,610
but to suspend you for the rest of
the semester.

310
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:08,062
Mom, you don't always have to call me
on FaceTime, you know.

311
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:11,617
- Why didn't you call me?
- I'm sorry, I didn't want you to worry.

312
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,224
I'm coming to pick you up.
I want you home.

313
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,486
No, look. I'll call you later, I promise.
Okay?

314
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,781
Look there.

315
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,891
- What the hell...
- She friended him right before he died.

316
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:35,501
And there's something else.

317
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:40,807
- Jesus, Kobe, I don't want...
- I don't want you to watch. I want you to listen.

318
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,190
What is that?

319
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,505
I don't know. I think it's wasps.

320
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,715
She's got black wasps all over her profile.

321
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,719
I did some research, and...

322
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,480
some people associated them with evil.

323
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,233
They said they appeared wherever
witches lived.

324
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:07,767
They like follow them around and protect them.

325
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,011
Jesus.

326
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:17,473
Who is this girl?

327
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,561
Do you think you can get us into her room?

328
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:42,035
Come on.

329
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,778
Not much into fashion, was she.

330
00:42:56,255 --> 00:43:00,019
- Do you even know what you're looking for?
- You know, just anything.

331
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,933
Hey, hey. Look at this.

332
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,644
- That's her.
- And who are these two?

333
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:27,719
Can you find out what school this is?

334
00:43:28,803 --> 00:43:30,565
If it's ever been online, yeah.

335
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:46,127
Are you the young lady who called?

336
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:48,087
Marina's friend?

337
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:50,443
Yes.

338
00:44:58,606 --> 00:45:00,723
How close did you say you were again?

339
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:05,455
I was just getting to know her when she...

340
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:09,792
- I didn't even know her real name.
- Nedifar.

341
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:11,971
Marina Nedifar.

342
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:17,747
Do you know what happened to
her parents?

343
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:21,563
I wouldn't know anything about that.
She came to us as a ward of the state.

344
00:45:23,283 --> 00:45:26,191
Poor girl, she had such a rough go
of things here.

345
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,950
She was always very sensitive,
always alone.

346
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:06,079
Fleeing into her little fantasy worlds.

347
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,081
And she found some dark corners online.

348
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,521
Things no child should see.

349
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,669
Sometimes...

350
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,693
she would just stare at the computer
for hours.

351
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:25,021
Nothing on the screen at all.

352
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:27,461
Just her own reflection in the darkness.

353
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,568
The kids became terrified of her.

354
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:37,865
They said she gave them nightmares.

355
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,601
Fuck!

356
00:48:12,777 --> 00:48:14,028
Jesus!

357
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:58,690
The two boys in the photo. They were
found dead near Saddle Mills...

358
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:00,441
with their faces mutilated.

359
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:03,892
They were swarmed by black wasps.

360
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:05,842
What?

361
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,698
Tyler, I know you could get in trouble for
this, but please, can you...

362
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:12,993
can you access your records somehow?

363
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:17,424
Like a family contact or last address. Anything.

364
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:20,895
- We don't even know her last name.
- Nedifar.

365
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,377
Marina Nedifar.

366
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,178
Laura?

367
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:57,410
Hello!

368
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:00,913
Hello!

369
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:03,332
Is anybody here?

370
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,314
Hello!

371
00:52:56,688 --> 00:53:00,055
This isn't real. This isn't real.
This isn't real.

372
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:07,405
It's not real. No! This isn't happening!

373
00:53:07,624 --> 00:53:09,230
This isn't real.

374
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,700
No!

375
00:53:43,017 --> 00:53:46,020
Miss Woodson?

376
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,527
She rips out her own hair before she
slits her throat.

377
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,427
Now I've been on this job for 25 years,
and that's a first for me.

378
00:54:12,094 --> 00:54:14,075
Is there some shitty new drug we
don't know about?

379
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:16,264
They never took anything.

380
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:20,424
What I want to know is where you got
the elevator footage that you posted.

381
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:27,679
For the last time, I'm not posting any of this.

382
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,892
Well the good news for you is we can't link
your IP-address to any of these videos.

383
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,479
We can't find any address at all,
which doesn't make any sense.

384
00:54:36,896 --> 00:54:39,815
Unless you're familiar with our IT department.

385
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:45,559
It all has to do with this girl.

386
00:54:46,048 --> 00:54:48,936
You really know a lot of dead people,
Miss Woodson.

387
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:49,838
I don't think this was a suicide, Laura.
I think it was a ritual.

388
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:55,156
Um... that... what you're looking at here,
these are black mirrors.

389
00:56:55,416 --> 00:56:57,564
They've been used in the occult for
thousands of years.

390
00:56:58,273 --> 00:57:01,066
And they say if you stare into it,

391
00:57:01,066 --> 00:57:07,342
you can communicate with some other
side. It's called scrying.

392
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:11,116
But sometimes, these witches,

393
00:57:11,116 --> 00:57:15,141
if they were being hunted, if they didn't
have any other way out...

394
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,883
they would hang and burn themselves in
front of a black mirror,

395
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:19,728
and become something else.

396
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,887
Call it whatever you want, an evil spirit...

397
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:25,367
um... a demon.

398
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:29,183
The point is how they got revenge on people

399
00:57:29,194 --> 00:57:32,634
by possessing them and haunting them
and killing them.

400
00:57:33,771 --> 00:57:35,209
How'd they ever stop it?

401
00:57:36,898 --> 00:57:41,360
It says they had to find the original mirror,
the one they burned themselves in front of

402
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,237
and destroy it.

403
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:46,228
You mean...

404
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,094
her laptop.

405
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:50,190
It's her black mirror.

406
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:53,026
We need to find out where she killed herself.

407
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:42,619
What?

408
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:25,154
There has to be something here.

409
00:59:25,905 --> 00:59:27,719
Something that can help us.

410
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:31,847
I think I'm going home.

411
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,466
I can't handle this.

412
00:59:37,602 --> 00:59:39,572
I'm so sorry for everything.

413
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,585
- Please don't go.
- Sorry.

414
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,945
I can't.

415
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:04,655
- Paying your respects?
- Disgusting.

416
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,676
You're late.

417
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:43,479
Why is everyone talking about you.
What have you done to this girl?

418
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,524
I haven't done anything to her. She just...

419
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:49,609
attached herself to me.

420
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:52,705
Now everyone thinks that...

421
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:55,833
Please, baby I want you home.
You're coming home with me.

422
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:59,232
I can't, I can't! I have to stay and
figure it out.

423
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:00,806
Figure what out?

424
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:06,092
...suffered serious injuries. Police have

425
01:01:06,092 --> 01:01:08,875
a suspect in custody. But are not releasing

426
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:11,950
any information until they complete
their investigation.

427
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:15,276
Moore's Grove. It's a deserted farm town
about two hours away.

428
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:20,332
There was a fire there about 20 years
ago at some weird commune.

429
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:24,273
Marina's mother, Ada Nedifar lived there until
somebody burned the whole place down.

430
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:27,318
What?

431
01:01:27,943 --> 01:01:32,227
They kept some husk of her body alive...

432
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,927
until Marina was delivered.

433
01:01:36,846 --> 01:01:39,046
She was alone in the womb for months.

434
01:01:40,505 --> 01:01:42,590
Jesus, she was always alone.

435
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,074
Do you think this is where she went
to kill herself?

436
01:01:49,127 --> 01:01:51,004
It's the only lead we have.

437
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:58,134
What's going on with her profile?
What's that on there?

438
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,267
Leave me a thing.

439
01:04:00,267 --> 01:04:02,425
Something's wrong. Something's wrong.

440
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,625
Stop right here!

441
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:10,962
Oh my God!

442
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:17,186
Olivia!

443
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:18,948
- Olivia...
- Help...

444
01:04:20,835 --> 01:04:22,629
Get out! Get out! Help her!

445
01:04:22,629 --> 01:04:24,234
- Help her!
- Help...

446
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,635
She's stable. She might actually make
it through this.

447
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,160
Even if she does...

448
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:04,361
Marina's never gonna stop.

449
01:05:07,426 --> 01:05:09,397
Shit.

450
01:05:09,397 --> 01:05:10,835
Just stay here.

451
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:12,889
Stay with Liv. Please.

452
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:15,527
Don't let her be alone.

453
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:17,955
Where are you going?

454
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:29,413
Whoa! Someone had a rough day.

455
01:05:34,886 --> 01:05:38,473
What happens if there's still people living
there? What is this place now?

456
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:40,390
I don't know.

457
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,206
No matter what, I'm finding that laptop
and I'm gonna fucking smash it!

458
01:05:45,624 --> 01:05:47,417
- Kobe?
- Yes?

459
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:52,891
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Who says I'm doing it for you?

460
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:01,877
Where the hell are you? The cops are
asking me a million questions.

461
01:06:02,533 --> 01:06:04,744
I... I'm going to Moore's Grove. I'm sorry.

462
01:06:04,744 --> 01:06:06,725
Don't go there alone!

463
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:10,634
I... I'm not alone. I'm with Kobe.

464
01:06:14,825 --> 01:06:16,181
I'm coming to meet you.

465
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,684
So? Where is she?

466
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,509
I don't know, man. Bad reception.

467
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:26,585
Alright. Keep trying.

468
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:57,819
Shit.

469
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:12,988
- Charming.
- Yeah.

470
01:07:17,836 --> 01:07:18,982
Thanks.

471
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:25,352
Shit, there's no service.

472
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:28,564
What are you so fucking nervous about?
You're going to be fine.

473
01:07:31,596 --> 01:07:36,038
- What are you talking about?
- Well she wants to make you lonely.

474
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:38,759
If that's true, you're the only
one that's safe.

475
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,434
Hi, sweetheart.

476
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:58,713
No, no Chinese noodles.

477
01:07:59,536 --> 01:08:02,737
No, no, no. I said NO Chinese.

478
01:08:16,488 --> 01:08:18,771
No Chinese. I said...

479
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,837
No, I mean... Sure, we could have
Chinese.

480
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:23,911
Yes.

481
01:08:24,985 --> 01:08:27,028
From the one down the...

482
01:08:27,664 --> 01:08:29,019
Wait, I'll call you back.

483
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,334
Don't shoot. I don't want to die.

484
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:46,106
Please please...

485
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:56,793
Jesus.

486
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:02,880
Really?

487
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:30,151
Laura?

488
01:11:09,423 --> 01:11:10,882
- Kobe.
- What?

489
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,479
She's not here.

490
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:17,074
Did you check the basement?

491
01:11:17,866 --> 01:11:19,222
What basement?

492
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:50,443
Kobe?

493
01:12:57,345 --> 01:12:58,481
Kobe?

494
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:02,818
Kobe.

495
01:13:10,491 --> 01:13:11,637
Kobe.

496
01:13:32,363 --> 01:13:33,781
What's wrong?

497
01:13:39,932 --> 01:13:41,287
I'm sorry.

498
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:44,092
She can't make you lonely if
you're dead.

499
01:14:07,872 --> 01:14:09,019
Laura!

500
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:17,077
Laura!

501
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:21,205
Hey, it's Laura. Leave a message.

502
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:24,537
What do you mean you don't know where
she is? What happened back there?

503
01:16:24,704 --> 01:16:27,591
Hey dumbfuck I'm talking to you!
What happened?

504
01:16:31,178 --> 01:16:35,410
Listen to me. If you touch her, I'll fucking
kill you. Now where the hell is she?

505
01:16:35,451 --> 01:16:37,432
She's absolutely fine!

506
01:16:37,474 --> 01:16:39,663
We are completely fucked!

507
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:41,915
She's just peachy.

508
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:48,744
- Tyler...
- Thank God!

509
01:16:48,744 --> 01:16:50,652
I thought something happened to you.

510
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,852
I just texted you an address.

511
01:16:53,259 --> 01:16:56,417
Laura? I... I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

512
01:17:01,348 --> 01:17:02,703
Tyler?

513
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:09,355
Are you sure you don't want me to
take you to a hospital?

514
01:17:11,232 --> 01:17:14,057
Take me to the factory.

515
01:17:56,175 --> 01:18:00,262
- I still think we can beat this.
- Shut up, man.

516
01:18:01,387 --> 01:18:02,940
Seriously.

517
01:18:04,223 --> 01:18:06,996
You have no idea what we're dealing with.

518
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,125
- I do. I saw where we're headed.
- Shut up, Kobe!

519
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,522
- I saw it.
- Shut up!

520
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,389
Are you telling me you're willing to
die for her?

521
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,777
Because we've all been dying for her!

522
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:29,056
Stay in the car.

523
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:59,151
Mom.

524
01:20:00,558 --> 01:20:03,947
Laura, where have you been?
I can't reach you.

525
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,355
Mom, are you okay?

526
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,513
I'm seeing things, Laura.

527
01:20:08,628 --> 01:20:10,546
I keep seeing that girl.

528
01:20:10,577 --> 01:20:14,404
I'm sorry... it's my fault.

529
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,748
What's happening to us?

530
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:20,304
Listen to me. I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

531
01:20:20,627 --> 01:20:24,901
I'm going to sort this out, somehow.
I'm going to stop it, somehow.

532
01:20:25,871 --> 01:20:27,018
Mom?

533
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,740
- Mom! Mom!
- I'll protect you.

534
01:20:33,888 --> 01:20:35,202
Mom!

535
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:40,393
Mom!

536
01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:43,333
Mom!

537
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:02,693
Laura!

538
01:21:04,382 --> 01:21:05,737
Laura!

539
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,260
Tyler.

540
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:12,368
Tyler.

541
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:23,815
I was so worried about you.

542
01:21:26,003 --> 01:21:27,891
Laura, hey.

543
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,591
Laura, look at me.

544
01:21:32,509 --> 01:21:37,201
- My mom, she's...
- Jesus, what happened to you?

545
01:21:49,377 --> 01:21:50,482
Hi.

546
01:23:15,751 --> 01:23:17,585
What do you want from me?

547
01:23:22,902 --> 01:23:25,331
What else do you want from me?

548
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,046
I just want to be friends, Laura.

549
01:24:13,225 --> 01:24:15,206
Best friends.

550
01:24:19,283 --> 01:24:20,846
Forever.

551
01:24:54,217 --> 01:24:55,458
Laura.

552
01:24:57,908 --> 01:24:59,148
Laura.

553
01:25:03,527 --> 01:25:05,717
Come to me.

554
01:25:10,929 --> 01:25:12,628
Come to me.

555
01:25:16,173 --> 01:25:17,924
Come to me.
