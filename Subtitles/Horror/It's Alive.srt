1
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,833
Honey?

2
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,280
- Frank?
- What's the matter, he kicking again?

3
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,870
No, it's time.

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,470
You always make me feel so...

5
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,999
Frank!

6
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,473
- You're awful.
- All right, let's get ready, huh?

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,559
Frank?

8
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,517
Oh, honey,
you better go wake up Chris.

9
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,793
Chris.

10
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,557
Come on, I got your number.

11
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,994
Come on.

12
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,718
Thattaboy.

13
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,792
- Dad, what time is it?
- What time is it? Time to get up.

14
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,232
I have to drop you off at Charley's house.
You have to go to school from there.

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,879
- Why?
- Well, I wonder why.

16
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,792
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

17
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,272
- Oh, is Mom having the baby?
- Yes. A trick she does every 11 years.

18
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,908
- I guess so.
- Why don't you get dressed...

19
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,389
...and don't forget your books.
- Okay.

20
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,993
- Dad?
- Yeah?

21
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,113
Anything happen to her? I saw on TV
in a movie once, where the mother died.

22
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,197
Well, you know something?

23
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,877
Things like that
happened a long time ago.

24
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,271
They don't happen that way anymore.
She had you, didn't she?

25
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,749
Yeah, look at the size of you,
you big ox.

26
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,873
Okay, now, here you go.
Let's get ready. Attaboy.

27
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,990
Why can't I go with you
to the hospital?

28
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,990
We'd love to have you, but the doctors
don't allow little boys in hospitals.

29
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,310
If I have my tonsils out again
I can go there.

30
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,637
You'd be there for a week
and we'd be home in three days.

31
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,952
You young whippersnappers.
You're not like the old team.

32
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,948
Out with old Mr. Dunson, out on the
plains and prairie, driving those cattle...

33
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,590
...getting their tonsils out in the middle
of the night, no doctors.

34
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,469
Oh, boy. You're not a chip off
the old block there, scout.

35
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,320
Well, maybe Charley
won't like having me around.

36
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,869
Charley won't like having you around.

37
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,431
Charley only sees his own boys two
Sundays a month and he loves kids.

38
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,628
Now, you young whippersnapper,
kiss your mother goodbye.

39
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,758
Listen, we'll give you a call
as soon as we find out...

40
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
...whether you've got
a baby sister or a brother.

41
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,315
I don't care, as long as you're okay.
And you give me one of the puppies.

42
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,711
Charley!

43
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,356
Honey, your book.

44
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,159
- Hi, Charley!
- Okay, Lenore, good luck to you.

45
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,517
Call me, Frank. Call me.

46
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,157
Well, pal, let's go and whip up
some French toast.

47
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,514
I'm having my baby.

48
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,714
Nurse, you know what they call them?

49
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,914
In Ireland, my mother used to call them
the "wee cuddies" and the "wee cubs."

50
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,719
The wee cuddies and wee...
Where could you get that?

51
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,514
Wee cuddies and wee cubs.
I hope I have one like that.

52
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,872
Would you please come to the labor
room now? It's the time to go back.

53
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,314
- The labor room?
- Yes.

54
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,913
- All right.
- This way.

55
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,990
How did you know about
the wee cuddies and the wee cubs?

56
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,151
I learned about them a long time ago.

57
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,153
- You speak Gaelic? Are you Irish?
- Yes. No, Scottish.

58
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,436
- Scottish? And you speak Gaelic?
- I do.

59
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,477
- You do speak Gaelic?
- This way.

60
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,632
An Irish and a Gaelic.
An Irish and a Scotsman.

61
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,756
- An Irish and a Scotsman.
- Yes.

62
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,754
Hang on to my hand.

63
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,310
Honey, I'm not very brave.
Oh, this little guy's gonna kill me.

64
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,988
- Well, maybe I'll get a doctor.
- No, no.

65
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,151
He's just different than Chris,
that's all.

66
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,232
I tried to talk to the doctor
and make him understand...

67
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,391
...but I couldn't make him understand.

68
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,439
It seems like it's different.
Honey, you better get the nurse.

69
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,955
Nurse, hurry up, please.

70
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,676
- You better go to the waiting room.
- Just a minute, please. I love you.

71
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,076
I'm glad. I'm glad we decided to
have the baby, aren't you?

72
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,470
We both want it.
Don't worry about a thing.

73
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,552
It's not gonna tie you down,
is it, sweetheart?

74
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,433
Are you gonna feel trapped
like you did last time?

75
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,833
- Calm down. Take a deep breath.
- I can't!

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,072
Take a deep breath. Calm down.

77
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,313
Relax. Try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

78
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,196
Hey, listen, have you got something
to stir the coffee with?

79
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,796
Yeah, here, use that. I've been using it
for the past three hours.

80
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,235
You get used
to the taste of lead in coffee.

81
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,115
There is an overabundance of lead
in all the things we eat nowadays.

82
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,714
We're slowly but surely
poisoning ourselves.

83
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,714
Fine world to bring a kid into, fellas.

84
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,599
- I could cite examples...
- You don't have to lecture.

85
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,718
Take a look at that smog.
What difference does it make...

86
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,792
...if we breathe it or eat it?
- Maybe we'll adapt to it.

87
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,396
I'm an exterminator. We service
the Beverly Hills-Westwood area.

88
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,670
Here. Here's my card.

89
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,758
I'm not trying to drum up business
or anything. No.

90
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,629
The point is, years back, we developed
this spray to kill roaches...

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,398
...and other household pests.

92
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,916
Well, all we ended up doing
was creating a new breed of roaches.

93
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,153
- Is that right?
- Bigger, stronger and harder to kill.

94
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,039
You wanna play poker?
Five-card draw.

95
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,476
- Come on.
- Might as well.

96
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,313
Let's clear some of this stuff away
and get going.

97
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,631
I just hope my wife isn't gonna have
any trouble, you know?

98
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,990
She did the last baby in 45 minutes.

99
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,031
- No kidding.
- That's a fact.

100
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,272
I thought they said
the second one came faster.

101
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,838
You got nothing to complain about.
My wife's been in labor for six hours.

102
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,589
Son of a bitch of a thing
stole my 50 cents!

103
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,597
Hey, hold it.

104
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,595
Here's your 50 cents.
No, really. No, no. Here's 50 cents.

105
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,910
Go on. Sit down and read a magazine
or something.

106
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,439
You know what's the biggest problem
in Beverly Hills?

107
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,990
Snails. Yeah, snails and slugs.

108
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,149
They can wipe out a lawn
in just a few weeks.

109
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,397
Folks feel sorry for them.

110
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,438
They're not like
your usual pest, you know?

111
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,639
Folks just hate to see all them snails
laying on their lawns, dead.

112
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,993
Snails and slugs and bugs.

113
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,718
Any of you guys
in a happier profession?

114
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,199
I think we've got
a really effective anesthetic.

115
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,830
We'll check you before
we really do anything.

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,551
- You know, I hurt...
- But you're doing just great. Just relax.

117
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,109
- It's been different than...
- You've done your share, we'll do ours.

118
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,838
She's fully dilated.
The head's on the perineum.

119
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,676
- I know something's wrong.
- It's nothing really wrong, honey...

120
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,229
...it's just a very, very big baby.

121
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,513
- Gonna be fine, but I need your help.
- I know something's wrong.

122
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,717
How big was your last baby?
How big, did you say?

123
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,953
Seven pounds, 4 ounces. I told you
that this baby was different than Chris.

124
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,111
This baby is just gigantic.

125
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,478
It's probably 10, 101/2,
maybe even 11 pounds.

126
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,632
Got a gigantic head,
but she's got a big pelvis.

127
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,990
And she's got plenty of relaxation.

128
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,355
I'm trying to cooperate.

129
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,751
All right, all right. Relax. Relax.

130
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,790
This thing is just immense.

131
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,274
Now, we're just putting forceps
on the baby's head. Just breathe deep.

132
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,072
Don't push, just pant.
Now, we're just easing the baby out.

133
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,199
- Something's wrong.
- All right.

134
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,279
Now, we just cut you.
You didn't feel that, did you?

135
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,759
- No.
- Okay, fine.

136
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,878
Now, the baby will be out
in just about 30 seconds.

137
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,078
Davis! Davis! Wait!

138
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,878
What does my baby look like?!
What's wrong with my baby?!

139
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,394
Doctor!

140
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,279
- Doctor!
- Davis, out of here!

141
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,673
The umbilical cord's been severed.
Looks like it's been chewed off.

142
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,956
Where's the baby?!
The baby, doctor!

143
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,720
- Get off of me!
- Get your hands off me!

144
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,916
Darling!

145
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,433
- Lenore! Lenore!
- Come on, let's go!

146
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,397
Let me go! Let me go!

147
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,715
Let go of me!

148
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,878
- We're gonna calm you down.
- Let me go! My wife!

149
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,398
Who stole my baby, doctor?

150
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,757
Don't. Don't touch me.
Don't you touch me.

151
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,194
They stole my baby.

152
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,032
Frank!
I don't want my baby to be dead!

153
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,234
I don't...
Tell me my baby isn't dead, please.

154
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,551
I assure you, Mrs. Davis,
your baby is very much alive.

155
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,509
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

156
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,954
Located a broken skylight
on the third floor.

157
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,873
Blood and excess tissue on the roof.

158
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,992
Lieutenant, what's it look like to you?

159
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,557
Something small.

160
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,916
Doctor.

161
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,359
She's coming out of sedation now.

162
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,279
Lenore?

163
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,593
Can you hear me, darling?

164
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,517
Somebody might have abducted our baby
and I'm holding this hospital responsible.

165
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,077
That hole in the skylight isn't large
enough for a full-sized human being.

166
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,629
There's no other way out
of that delivery room.

167
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,031
- The doctor's correct.
- Let's not have a discussion about it.

168
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,078
I've asked your husband
to submit to some tests.

169
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,793
And I've refused.

170
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,711
You've never been exposed to
radioactivity and radioactive material...

171
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,634
...or undergone extensive x-rays?
- No, doctor, I told you.

172
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,190
Well, we can't rule out genetic damage.

173
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,397
I notice you did inquire
about abortion eight months ago.

174
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,758
Doesn't everybody inquire about it now?
It was just a question of convenience.

175
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,276
- We decided to have the baby.
- We all make mistakes.

176
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,353
I apologize for that crack.
Let me talk to you outside. Come on.

177
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,156
You're not afraid of me, are you?

178
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,233
I've always been afraid of you.
Especially those eyes.

179
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,151
I wanted a boy so badly.

180
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,908
I think he was probably very frightened.
I know he's different.

181
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
Yeah, I just...

182
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,236
I think he was probably afraid
they were gonna hurt him.

183
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,355
He's not ugly.

184
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,077
Oh, you're so exhausted, sweetheart.

185
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,034
You don't know what you're saying.

186
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,471
I'm gonna check up on those two.

187
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,556
I don't trust them.

188
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,829
I mean, can you imagine?

189
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,950
Can you imagine those guys,
trying to blame us?

190
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,712
We are the parents, sweetheart.

191
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,119
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

192
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,390
Doctor Norton decided
your wife can go home.

193
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,949
- First thing in the morning.
- You realize...

194
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,715
...it's in everyone's interest
to keep this quiet for the time being...

195
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,111
...at least until we can find out
what's become of the infant.

196
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,078
- You have heard no word about it?
- No.

197
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,755
I don't see how it could survive
without clothing and nourishment.

198
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,233
- Of course, like any animal, it may be...
- Well, it's not an animal, doctor...

199
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,311
...you know that very well.

200
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,308
Whatever it is,
you can't classify it as an animal.

201
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,268
It's human, doctor, and that's
what's disgusting to you, isn't it?

202
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,998
It kills like an animal.

203
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,551
And when we find it,
we're gonna have to destroy it like one.

204
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,956
Well, I don't care.

205
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,270
I suppose you have
to do what's necessary.

206
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,158
I'm glad you feel that way.

207
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,551
I only hope your wife
understands as well.

208
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,631
What's there to understand?

209
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,509
- Better not to think about it.
- Hey, look...

210
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,912
...why not say good night to your
wife and maybe I drive you home.

211
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
No, thanks.

212
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,992
Okay, darling,
I'll see you in the morning.

213
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,797
Stay on duty.

214
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,512
<i>Police still offer no explanation</i>
<i>in the five deaths...</i>

215
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,990
<i>... which occurred early today</i>
<i>at Saint George Medical Center.</i>

216
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,515
<i>Officers are still working</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

217
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,399
<i>Sources at the hospital alleged</i>
<i>the deaths resulted...</i>

218
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,030
<i>... from attacks by an infant</i>
<i>born only today in a mutated form...</i>

219
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,952
<i>... but officials declined comment.</i>

220
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,715
<i>This station has acquired information</i>
<i>naming Mr. And Mrs. Frank Davis...</i>

221
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,270
<i>... of West Los Angeles as the parents</i>
<i>of the infant in question.</i>

222
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,716
<i>The whereabouts of the newborn child</i>
<i>are not known.</i>

223
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,158
They named us.
The bastards, they named us.

224
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,833
Barbara, would you
come here for a minute, please?

225
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,797
- Yes?
- I have to pick up my wife...

226
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,635
...at the hospital tonight. Reschedule
the Sturbridge dinner for tomorrow.

227
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,839
- I think Mr. Clayton wants to talk to you.
- And about the Marcus affair...

228
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,270
...I think we can have cocktails at 6:30
tomorrow. I know he wants to approve...

229
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,956
...the campaign by the end of the week.
- I think you better see Mr. Clayton now.

230
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,754
All right.

231
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,471
I'll be right back.

232
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,399
- Well, well, come on in.
- Hello, pal.

233
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,750
You must be exhausted.
You eaten anything?

234
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,151
Get Frank a couple of poached eggs
on an English muffin...

235
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,915
...with a side of bacon
and a tall glass of fresh orange juice.

236
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,714
Should do the trick.
Don't want you collapsing.

237
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,394
Frank, don't let it get you down.

238
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,597
These things happen,
or at least that's what they say.

239
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,910
- Who's they?
- I spoke to the hospital.

240
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,473
They give you information?

241
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,108
Well, I got connections over there,
you know.

242
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,637
I'm the vice-chairman of the fundraising
committee. If there's anything I can do...

243
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,394
No. Thanks.
I'm getting her out of there tonight.

244
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,999
You think that's wise?

245
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,678
Say, Barbara told me
you want to rap with me.

246
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,117
Yeah, Frank.

247
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,676
Frank, you...

248
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,988
- You've accrued three weeks vacation.
- Yeah.

249
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,073
You think it'd be a good idea
if you took it now?

250
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,872
I can't, Bob.
I mean, I got the Marcus account...

251
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,318
...and the Sturbridge campaign.
I'm just bogged down in work.

252
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,678
Besides, I need to work.
It keeps my mind off things.

253
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,673
Frank, we're running
a public-relations business here.

254
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,675
Our job is creating an image. And right
now, well, you're a little controversial.

255
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,393
See, our clients want
their PR men to be anonymous.

256
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,991
Maybe after a little while,
when you're a little less of a celebrity.

257
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,434
You're not taking those accounts
away from me, are you?

258
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,910
I mean, not now. Last-minute?

259
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,317
These things happen, Frank.

260
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,632
Look, you know O'Connors down
in accounting? He's got a retarded kid.

261
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,033
Insists on keeping him in the house too.
Well, nobody thinks a thing of that.

262
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,191
Nobody blames him.

263
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,558
We're not talking about a retarded kid
and you know it.

264
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,835
We're talking about
a monstrosity of some kind.

265
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,149
Yeah, well, maybe we better
not talk about that.

266
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,759
Bob.

267
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,034
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

268
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,591
Just that I...

269
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,878
I don't know what to do, Bob.
How to behave.

270
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,236
And they...

271
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,152
Putting microphones in my face. They're
asking me questions I don't understand.

272
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,193
You know, what you need
is a good public-relations firm...

273
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,430
...to handle all of that for you.

274
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,869
That's very funny.

275
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,198
Bob...

276
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,794
Bob, this is all gonna be all right,
isn't it?

277
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,997
When whatever this thing is
is dead. Right?

278
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,354
Maybe it already is.

279
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,148
Look, Frank, why don't you go down
the service elevator...

280
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,118
...you won't have to meet
all those media people.

281
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,230
Bob...

282
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,196
Take care.

283
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,200
Have them empty out his desk.
Send his personal articles to his house.

284
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,679
He won't be coming back.

285
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,797
- Mr. Davis, what did it look like?
- I got nothing to say.

286
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,349
- What are you afraid of?
- Get out of my face.

287
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,272
I got no comment.

288
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,750
Get that goddamn thing out of my face!
Get out of the way!

289
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,070
- What did it look like?
- I don't know.

290
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,437
Never mind my baby!
Leave my wife out of it, you understand?

291
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,717
Aren't we almost home?

292
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,030
We'll be there in a few minutes.

293
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,113
I feel better already,
getting out of that terrible place.

294
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,716
I don't have to take more shots, do I?
I don't like taking shots.

295
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,352
- I don't like being made to go to sleep.
- Well, I engaged nurses in three shifts.

296
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,593
I'm surprised anybody
would even wanna work for us.

297
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,269
- Well, Dr. Norton took care of it.
- Oh, good.

298
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,317
And I'm gonna be there all the time.

299
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,870
- What about...
- Yeah, I told the office...

300
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,918
...I have to have those three weeks
vacation they owe me.

301
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,279
Oh, what about that Marcus account?
That was very important to you.

302
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,668
You're more important.

303
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,116
What about Chris? Have you told him?
Does he know anything?

304
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,430
I spoke to Charley.

305
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,472
He kept him home from school.
Hasn't told him anything.

306
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,519
- Good.
- Sooner or later, he'll switch on the TV.

307
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,114
It's only so long you can keep
a secret like that.

308
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,837
Dad, why can't I go to school or go out
or have friends over?

309
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,999
Chris, I can't tell you now, son.

310
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,958
You'll have to trust me.
You do trust me, don't you?

311
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,475
- Sure, Dad.
<i>- You have to spend all your time...</i>

312
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,592
...with Charley this week.
You wouldn't mind that.

313
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,834
Chris. Chris, hey, buddy,
you don't wanna hurt his feelings.

314
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,952
I like Charley, but I wanna
see Mom and the baby.

315
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,111
<i>- The baby's not home yet.</i>
- Is it sick?

316
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,957
Yeah, that's right, son.
The baby's sick.

317
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,398
And everything here's a mess.
So it would be much better...

318
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,712
...if you stay where you are.
- You tell Charley to let me watch TV.

319
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,678
<i>- Okay, put him on.</i>
- Okay.

320
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,309
Okay, Frank. Look, we'll take care
of everything. Hey, I had an idea.

321
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,755
I'll take Chris up to the lake
for fishing.

322
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,998
Okay, Charley. Thank you.

323
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,236
Oh, and give my love to Lenore.

324
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,631
Thanks, Charley.

325
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,710
Hunting and killing babies
doesn't seem to be my specialty.

326
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,836
So, what do you want, a transfer?

327
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,355
Well, my wife's in her eighth month.

328
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,159
Since I started this,
she hasn't gotten any rest.

329
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,193
Me being so involved
really brings it home.

330
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,233
Besides, I guess you know
we lost our last baby.

331
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,478
Look, you're lucky you don't have
grown kids nowadays.

332
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,349
People without children
don't realize how lucky they are.

333
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,474
Take these.

334
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,710
Make you feel much better.

335
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,239
Did you see it, Mrs. Davis?

336
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,315
Surely you must have gotten
one glimpse.

337
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,238
They say it has teeth and claws.
Did you know that?

338
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,596
How should I know that?

339
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,278
Were you aware that it killed
another person just last night?

340
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,592
A musician on Santa Monica Boulevard.
He was on his way home from work...

341
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,751
...about 2 in the morning...

342
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,150
...and that was the last anybody
saw of him.

343
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,515
They found him in an alley.

344
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,952
Well, they can't be sure that it was...

345
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,397
There's no doubt about it.

346
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,757
The wounds are the same
as the doctor and nurses suffered.

347
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,159
Well...

348
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,992
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Just say anything you feel.

349
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,993
- What's under that napkin?
- There's nothing there.

350
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,354
A recorder! A tape recorder!

351
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,710
I'm a nurse. You can tell me anything.

352
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,395
- Who are you working for?
- I really am a registered nurse...

353
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,949
...and I write a little on the side.

354
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,271
She's taking interviews
on a tape recorder.

355
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,790
Get out.

356
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,358
Frank?

357
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,110
We just have to get rid
of everybody.

358
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,750
- Let's not have any more nurses, honey.
- All right.

359
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,520
We'll let them all go.

360
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,999
Should have known better...

361
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,953
...than to trust anybody.

362
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,719
Actually, already in excess
of $ 100,000 has been allocated...

363
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,550
...by the university for examination
of this phenomenon.

364
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,075
We have some of the leading men
in the field.

365
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,119
It's hoped this might lead to a
breakthrough to a better understanding...

366
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,635
...of why mutations occur.

367
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,197
You wanna experiment on it?

368
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,473
My department has already cautioned
the police about excessive violence.

369
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,792
If it could be dispatched with a bullet or,
better still, some kind of a gas.

370
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,073
Undoubtedly, it's small and any kind of
bodily harm, especially from gunshots...

371
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,118
...or explosives...
- In other words, you want me...

372
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,633
...to sign away the body?

373
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,310
Well, it's your right. After all,
you are the child's father.

374
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,477
It's not my child.

375
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,716
That's very wise...

376
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,553
...to disassociate yourself emotionally.

377
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,909
Just sign each copy, please.

378
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,399
- Pen?
- Give him a pen.

379
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,116
You know, it seems that out of every
tragedy, out of every evil...

380
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,670
...some good can come if we
only apply ourselves.

381
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,355
I suppose that's gonna be in all
the medical journals?

382
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,993
History books?

383
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,757
"The Davis child."
"The Davis monster."

384
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,910
It's like Frankenstein.

385
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,790
In my opinion, this will be remembered
long after each of us is forgotten.

386
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,833
When I was a kid, I always thought...

387
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,596
...the monster was Frankenstein. Karloff
walking around in big shoes, grunting.

388
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,274
I thought he was Frankenstein.

389
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,754
Then I went to high school
and read the book...

390
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,909
...and I realized that Frankenstein
was the...

391
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,954
...doctor who created him.

392
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,188
Somehow the identities...

393
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,954
...get all mixed up, don't they?

394
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,954
One must not allow oneself
to be impressed by escapist fiction.

395
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,509
You forgot one.

396
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,393
Pen.

397
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,754
Frank, darling?

398
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,517
Hi, darling.

399
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,195
Mrs. Davis, I don't suppose you
took the pills I gave you.

400
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,595
You really should, you know.

401
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,719
Maybe it's all the pills I've taken
over the years that brought this on.

402
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,115
You really shouldn't be downstairs.

403
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,191
Maybe you'd both like
to have dinner with us.

404
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,960
I have wonderful lamb chops
in the refrigerator.

405
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,991
No, I'm afraid not.

406
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,909
Honey, why don't you go down
to the basement and get a bottle...

407
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,789
...of that nice Beaujolais. Won't that
go nicely with the lamb chops?

408
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,200
We have quite an extensive wine cellar.

409
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,319
It's one of Frank's many hobbies.
My husband's a many-faceted man.

410
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,630
I'll show these gentlemen to the door.

411
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,714
I'll get that wine.

412
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,758
Oh, great, great. Good. Good.

413
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,398
Boy, that basement's filthy.

414
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,436
<i>How long had she taken birth control</i>
<i>pills before this pregnancy?</i>

415
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,392
- Thirty-one months.
- You realize...

416
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,393
...I came from the East
specifically for this matter.

417
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,393
I realize that it is a police problem.

418
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,155
But once the thing is killed,
it becomes a medical problem. Now...

419
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,629
...you are in charge of that department?

420
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,597
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Now...

421
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,115
...nobody knows how
this thing happened.

422
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,034
It's really a matter of speculation
and perhaps that's for the best.

423
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,149
After all, if we find out that the cause
is medication that we manufacture...

424
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,198
...and it was administered over
a long period of time...

425
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,273
...it'd be bad for you and worse for us.
We're susceptible to lawsuits.

426
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,115
We'd think the government hadn't tested
and approved of those products...

427
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,793
...that we put on the market.

428
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,315
What do your interests recommend?

429
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,238
Absolute destruction of this thing.

430
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,393
Well, they've already signed over
the remains to the university.

431
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,997
But if there was nothing left of it...

432
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,516
...we would be most grateful to you.

433
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,756
You have had
a very successful career...

434
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,673
...until this freak incident.

435
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,995
You know, it could
work out for the best.

436
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,359
We have an opening on the board of our
research and development department.

437
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,791
Now, we wouldn't want people
to lose faith in us, would we?

438
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,040
- Hello?
- <i>Dr. Norton, please</i>.

439
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,316
No, Dr. Norton stepped out
for a moment. May I take a message?

440
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,109
<i>Tell him they've cornered the infant</i>
<i>at the Hawthorn School...</i>

441
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,635
<i>... in West Los Angeles.</i>

442
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,918
That's a few blocks from here.

443
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,590
<i>Ask the doctor to get over there</i>
<i>if he can. Thank you.</i>

444
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,675
I have to go out for a while.

445
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,159
All right.

446
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,918
You don't mind staying alone?

447
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,080
I'll keep everything warm.

448
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,279
Wait a minute, I'm Frank Davis.
I wanna see Lieutenant Perkins.

449
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,556
All right, take him.

450
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,754
Wonder what's the matter with him.

451
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,036
Screwed-up genes or something.

452
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,797
Wait here.

453
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,597
Davis, how the hell did you
find out about this?

454
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,989
There was a phone call for Dr. Norton.
I took the message.

455
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,992
My son Chris goes to school here.

456
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,589
I've been here a million times,
PTA meetings.

457
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,629
- Your kid goes here?
- That's right. He's in the sixth grade.

458
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,998
Listen.

459
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,156
Probably just a coincidence.

460
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,835
Look, Perkins, I want this thing
destroyed as much as anybody else.

461
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,877
- I realize that.
- Yeah, you realize.

462
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,270
Then why is everybody looking at me?

463
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,998
Yeah.

464
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,079
Like it's my own flesh and blood
or something.

465
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,989
Well, it's not! Understand?

466
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,310
It's no relation to me.

467
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,600
Nobody's looking at you.

468
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,558
Say, you have my deepest sympathy.

469
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,278
You and your wife.

470
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,749
Is it all right
if your driver drops me off...

471
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,798
...a block from my home?
I don't want my wife to see me.

472
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,878
You don't want her to know
you were here tonight?

473
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,953
I don't think she'd know how to take it.
Maybe I didn't do the right thing.

474
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,317
I'm just trying to show everybody
I feel the same way they do.

475
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,869
- I'm no different from anybody.
- We know that.

476
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,110
I got a boy, 11 years old.
He's healthy.

477
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,998
- He's brilliant.
- I understand.

478
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,191
You don't have
to keep telling us that.

479
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,875
We realize that.
Look, I gotta go back on duty.

480
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,308
Take him wherever he wants to go.

481
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,911
Davis said his kid went to this school.

482
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,832
Now, why, in all of Los Angeles,
would it happen to show up here?

483
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,033
Maybe it's looking for somebody.

484
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,279
I'd like us to all get together again
and be a family.

485
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,519
- I'm really trying very hard, Frank.
- I know, darling.

486
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,033
I can see that.

487
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,073
Wouldn't it be a great idea
to bring Chris home?

488
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,993
He's better off where he is.

489
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,270
Lenore, did you go out?

490
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,229
Lenore?

491
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,955
Lenore.

492
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,839
For chrissakes, answer me.

493
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,196
Are you feeling better?

494
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,391
Where the hell have you been?

495
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,597
- I've been straightening up.
- I've been calling you.

496
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,917
I've been all over the house,
straightening up.

497
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,829
Where? You weren't downstairs.
Didn't you hear me calling you?

498
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,594
Honey, there's a good movie on
with Paul Newman.

499
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,788
I gotta get something in my stomach.

500
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,190
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

501
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,915
Chris come back here today?

502
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,356
I said,
has Chris been back here today?

503
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,231
No.

504
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,391
Why do you say that?

505
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,233
You wouldn't lie to me?

506
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,474
I know you wanted Chris to come
back, but I specifically told you...

507
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,711
Chris.

508
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,356
Chris?

509
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,188
Chris, are you hiding someplace?

510
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,751
Don't fool around, now.

511
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,112
I wish somebody would respect
my feelings around here.

512
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,550
Why are you watching that stuff?

513
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,069
I thought you wanted
to watch a movie.

514
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,390
Who are you calling?
Don't call anybody.

515
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,233
Please don't call anybody.
Who are you calling?

516
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,079
- <i>How's Chris?</i>
- Had a hell of a time keeping him...

517
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,912
...from the newscasts and papers.

518
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,436
But the teacher sent over schoolwork,
so he's been keeping busy.

519
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,437
You've been with him all the time?

520
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,995
We just got back
from that fishing trip.

521
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,435
He hasn't been out of my sight
for a minute.

522
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,355
- Look, you wanna talk to him?
- No, I don't wanna talk to him.

523
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,230
- Hi, Dad. When can I come home?
- Did you come back here today?

524
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,715
Is the baby home
from the hospital yet?

525
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,553
Did I do anything wrong?

526
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,554
- Hey, how about something to eat?
- No, I'm not hungry. I wanna go to bed.

527
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,792
- I'm sorry, Charley. I'm not mad at you.
- That's okay, kid.

528
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,949
Honey, I want you to make love to me.
I want you to hold me and love me.

529
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,838
You know, there are other ways.

530
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,639
- Come on, sweetheart.
- There's no ice in there.

531
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,759
I'll get the ice. Wait a minute,
I'll get the ice. Wait, I'll get the...

532
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,198
Chris?

533
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,071
Chris?

534
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,597
Oh, my God. Chris!

535
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,792
Lenore?

536
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,434
What were you doing down
in the basement?

537
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,909
You know.

538
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,668
What are you gonna do?
What are you doing?

539
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,758
Why are you so anxious
to be the one to do it?

540
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,519
Who is it? Mom? Dad?

541
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,955
Frank. Frank, wait. Wait. Wait.

542
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,436
Frank, he could've killed you
when you were upstairs sleeping!

543
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,591
- Let go of me.
- He could've killed you!

544
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,149
Do you know why he didn't kill you?

545
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,474
Hello?

546
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,355
- He knows you're his father.
- What are you, crazy?

547
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,794
He knows.

548
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,552
He knows you're his father.

549
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,837
Don't worry. Don't be scared.

550
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,596
I'll protect you.

551
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,715
It's a boy, you know. It's a boy.

552
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,309
- I'll protect you.
- Chris, look out.

553
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,031
I hit it. I'm sure I hit it.

554
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,715
Charley! Look out, Charley!

555
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,716
Charley!

556
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:10,150
Go on, get down. Did you see it?
Did you see it? What does it look like?

557
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,795
It's no relation to us, Chris.

558
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,439
It can't be.

559
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,360
See what your baby did to Charley?

560
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,509
What did you do?

561
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,152
Will you tell him
about the doctors in the hospital?!

562
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,234
Lenore, take my son upstairs.

563
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,875
The doctors at the hospital were trying
to suffocate your little brother.

564
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,314
He just wants to live.

565
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,638
You should've called us soon as you
began to suspect it was near the house.

566
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,950
It's lost a lot of blood.

567
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,238
And it's my opinion that our troubles
are very nearly over.

568
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,598
- So shall we go?
- I wanna leave some men here.

569
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,479
In case it decides
to double back to the house.

570
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,078
I would...

571
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,231
I would like to go with you.

572
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,871
- Haven't you done enough already?
- No. Not yet.

573
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,474
You have to be the one to do it,
don't you?

574
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,312
Have you seen it?

575
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,393
Got a real good look at it?

576
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,597
It was too dark. It wouldn't matter.

577
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,913
I could do it.

578
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,709
You may have done it already,
if it doesn't stop bleeding.

579
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,598
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

580
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,792
We just can't take a civilian...

581
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,875
Look, I advise you to let him come along.
After all, it found its way home by itself.

582
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,750
It may be that it'll search out its father,
especially when he put a bullet in it.

583
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,229
What have we got to lose?

584
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,636
One more life.

585
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,351
You know how to use a gun?

586
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,397
Beg your pardon?

587
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,269
Do you know how to use a rifle?

588
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,513
Sure.

589
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,913
We'll issue you one,
for your own protection.

590
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,354
Okay.

591
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:14,119
<i>The shot that wounded the infant was</i>
<i>fired not by the police but by its father...</i>

592
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,397
<i>... public-relations executive</i>
<i>Frank Davis...</i>

593
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,109
<i>... who currently is accompanying police</i>
<i>on the manhunt.</i>

594
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,353
That's it.

595
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,478
That's how it can travel
without anybody seeing it.

596
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:19,471
<i>Units converge</i>
<i>at interceptor point 682 of project 9401</i>.

597
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,152
<i>Close off block sections 21218...</i>

598
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,353
<i>Divide units to cover all Sacatella,</i>
<i>L.A. River and...</i>

599
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,675
<i>Drains 26 and 34, 1663560-O...</i>

600
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,434
<i>... are now completely closed off</i>
<i>by our units.</i>

601
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,717
<i>Hold position and stand by.</i>

602
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,471
Let me have that.

603
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,473
Davis, you stay right here.
Here, take this.

604
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,955
Let's go. You stay here.

605
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,992
It's back there somewhere.

606
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,711
The damned fools must have walked
right by it. Now, I want that thing.

607
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,112
- Where's Davis?
- I don't know.

608
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:37,477
- He was supposed to stay here.
- Davis! Davis!

609
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,518
Stay where you are,
we'll come get you!

610
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,718
Davis! Davis, come back.

611
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,192
Frank!

612
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,999
Frank, do you hear me?

613
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,520
Proceeding to Los Angeles River inlet,
as ordered.

614
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,358
No.

615
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,871
I know it...

616
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,196
I know it hurts.

617
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:56,234
I know that.
But everything's gonna be all right.

618
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,876
See, I was...

619
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,831
Well, I...

620
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,278
I was scared, like you are.

621
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,436
No, no. You mustn't cry.

622
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,039
Because if you cry,
they'll hear you and they'll come.

623
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,230
No, no. It's all right.

624
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,356
It's gonna be all right.

625
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,955
It's gonna be all right.

626
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,673
Okay.

627
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,239
Okay.

628
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,074
Davis, come on out!

629
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,155
Come on out, Davis!

630
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,350
Where are you?

631
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,952
Davis!

632
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:08,829
<i>Davis has been seen moving through</i>
<i>the tunnel in possession of the infant.</i>

633
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,833
Keep her here.

634
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,078
<i>Drain stopped up ahead, impassable.</i>

635
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:20,751
Can you hear me, Frank?
It can't be saved. It's gotta die.

636
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,516
Just drop it and get the hell away
from it. Do you hear me, Frank?

637
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,632
Frank! Can you hear me?

638
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,390
All right, just stop there.
Stop right there.

639
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,834
It can't hurt anybody.

640
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,028
Look, lock it up. Study it.
But let it live, please.

641
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,152
Put down your weapons. It's wounded.
It can't hurt anybody.

642
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,118
Just drop it. Just drop it.
Just take it easy and drop it.

643
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,954
Back away. Back away!

644
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:18,312
If you fellas shoot, you're gonna shoot
me. Put the weapon down. It's harmless.

645
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,636
That son of a bitch dies here and now!

646
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,831
Drop it and stand aside, Davis.

647
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:29,353
In one second, whether you're holding it
or not, I'll put a bullet through it.

648
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,438
- Don't shoot.
- Kill it, lieutenant. Kill it!

649
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,750
Kill it! Kill it now!

650
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,311
Stop firing! Stop firing! Stop firing!

651
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,355
Yeah, I'm bringing them home.

652
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,719
<i>Lieutenant Perkins,</i>
<i>call for you on the private line.</i>

653
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,472
Right.

654

Perkins.

655
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,352
I understand.
