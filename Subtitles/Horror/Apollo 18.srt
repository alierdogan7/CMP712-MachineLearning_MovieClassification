1
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,515
There's just a lot
at stake here, you know?

2
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,060
<i>We're talkin' nation
versus nation,</i>

3
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,352
<i>and the race is still on.</i>

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,523
<i>There's lots to discover
out there, man.</i>

5
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,568
<i>I guess the call came in
on a Friday.</i>

6
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,031
Nate and I were
at Ben's for a barbecue.

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,994
<i>Um... Just a few beers,
you know, maybe more than a few.</i>

8
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,452
<i>With Ben's cooking,
you definitely need a few.</i>

9
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,625
<i>Nate took the call.
It was Milton,</i>

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,838
<i>and Milton said
18 was back on,</i>

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,427
but it was classified,
DOD, top secret.

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,683
Asked, you know,
"Are you OK with that?"

13
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,640
And he was like,
"Are you kidding me?"

14
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,515
<i>[man] I come from a family
of military pilots.</i>

15
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,685
Duty can sometimes
outbalance a private life.

16
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,151
<i>Make choices,
keep moving forward.</i>

17
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,317
<i>NASA already has something
like 800 pounds of rocks.</i>

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,079
So why we need more, I don't know, but,
hey, if it means a trip to the moon...

19
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,743
<i>Placing cameras. We got these
Westinghouses all over the place.</i>

20
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,878
<i>[John] Well, I think the way it's being
explained is they're using</i>

21
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,463
a Saturn V to launch
a classified DOD payload, uh,

22
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,846
which is meant to be very large,
very heavy, and, uh...

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,599
<i>...apparently unmanned.
- [Indistinct]</i>

24
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,351
Apparently.

25
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>[Nate] Placing these
high-frequency transmitters.</i>

26
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,309
Part of some early warning
antimissile defense system

27
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,567
<i>against the Soviet Union.</i>

28
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,230
<i>These PSD5s are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners,</i>

29
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,741
<i>they should pick up and track
anything we can't.</i>

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,574
<i>Gotta keep a little eye
on the Russians, there.</i>

31
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,613
Would've been nice
to tell my wife.

32
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,034
<i>Laura had been by my side
the whole time, and, uh...</i>

33
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,705
...she thinks I'm off doing a training
exercise with the Japanese space agency.

34
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,922
<i>Ryan, my boy, would've been nice to tell
him his old man's goin' to the moon.</i>

35
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,553
<i>I would've loved to have
brought him a souvenir.</i>

36
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,760
<i>Maybe a moon rock.
I don't know. Maybe one day.</i>

37
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,847
<i>[John] Ban was always first in class,</i>

38
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,477
<i>and I was always right at his heels.</i>

39
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>Yeah, I'll admit, I'm a little jealous
that he'll be moon-walkin' with Nate</i>

40
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,309
<i>while I'll be all by my
lonesome, piloting the orbiter.</i>

41
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,356
My job is, essentially, to make
sure I bring us home safely.

42
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,610
<i>Look, let's face it, these
missions are result-oriented,</i>

43
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,451
and, uh, we can't afford
to fail here, now can we?

44
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,287
<i>[Ben] Things can go wrong,
things do go wrong, it happens,</i>

45
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,952
<i>but you just gotta push
that out of your mind.</i>

46
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,460
It's just not an option.

47
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,255
<i>I'm proud to do it
for these guys.</i>

48
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,841
<i>And I'm proud to do it
for my country.</i>

49

54
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,929
- Bring any Christmas lights, Ben?
- Nope, not me.

55
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,682
[Nate] You ever see anything
like that before?

56
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,013
No, sir.

57
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,432
It's amazing.

You sure he's yours?

60
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,153
Watch it. He's a good kid.

61
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,034
[John] He's got big shoes to fill now.

62
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,740
- Big ol' moon boots.
- [chuckles]

63
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,245
[John] So, Nate, you wait all this time
to put your foot on the moon,

64
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,378
and you get to be number 13.
How you feel about that?

65
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,664
[Nate] You gonna be OK
with staying behind, John?

66
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,842
Oh, you know, it'd be nice
to have some alone time.

67
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,174
It's gettin' crowded in here.

68

[Nate] Negative, we'll miss our window.

107

00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:28,652
[Ben] Yeah, yeah. Perfect.
You call that a salute?

148

[Nate] OK, let me get a shot of you
with the LM in the background.

149

00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,646
- Tracks appear in single...
- [static overtakes dialogue]

330
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,480
[Nate] Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?

331
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,568
Houston, this is 18. Do you read?

332
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,031
[Ben] John's on the backside.
No comm from him, either.

333
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,868
Well, let's see where they lead.

334
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,496
[Ben] Impact crater.

335
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,836
You feel that?

336
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,467
[Nate] Yeah. Temperature dropped.

337
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,090
[Ben] Look at the footprints.

338
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,769
It doesn't make sense.

339
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,430
I think he was
just walking in circles.

340
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,315
[Nate] Disoriented.

341
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,282
- [Ben] Oxygen dep?
- [Nate] I don't know.

342
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,067
They go off in this direction.

343
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,623
Get up here!

344
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,554
[Nate] Holy shit.

345
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,731
[Ben] it's Russian.

346
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,483
What the hell?

347
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,413
[Ben] How could there be Russians
on the moon and nobody knows about it?

348
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,126
[Nate] We're on the moon
and nobody knows about us.

349
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,258
[Ben] Something's not right.

350
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,718
[Nate] I'm gonna look inside.

351
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,358
Lights are off.

352
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,678
[Nate] Somebody lost it in here.

353
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,770
This place is trashed.

354
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,448
Their systems aren't
that different from ours.

355
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,615
[Beeping, whirring]

356
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:52,079
[Nate] Powers up.
Oxygen reserves are good.

357
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,835
Can't tell if she's
fully operational, though.

358
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,045
- [Ben] Where the hell did they go?
- [Nate] I don't know.

359
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,883
[Ben] I'm gonna take a look around.

360
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,763
[Nate] But stay close.

361
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,016
Those Russians could be anywhere.

362
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,645
What the hell?

363
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,230
There's blood. A lot of it.

364
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,030
Somebody got hurt pretty bad.

365
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,956
[Ben] I don't like this.

366
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,302
I think I see something
inside the crater.

367
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,799
[Flash charging]

368
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,472
I'm goin' down.

369
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,984
[Nate] Wait, Ben. The suits
aren't ready for that kind of cold.

370
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,985
[Ben] It's OK,
the crater isn't so deep.

371
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,823
- [Flash charging]
- [Ben] it's so cold.

372
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,489
I just see rocks.

373
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,752
The ground, it's, uh...
it's different.

374
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,003
It feels... softer.

375
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,009
[Nate] Get out of there.

376
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,602
[Ben] Oh, God...

377
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,520
So cold.

378
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,939
- [Nate] Get out of there! Ben!
- [soft chittering]

379
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,075
[Ben] OK, yeah, all right.
I'm headin' back up.

380
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,282
[Ben] Holy shit! [gasping, panting]

381
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,373
[Ben] I found him!
I got the cosmonaut!

382
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:01,003
[Panting] it's OK. I'm all right.
I'm on my way up!

383
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,713
- [Nate] You all right?
- Yeah, I'm warmin' up.

384
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,177
Oh, Christ.
What the hell happened here?

385
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,510
[Nate] Maybe the other cosmonaut?

386
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,642
[Ben] You think he killed him?

387
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,648
There's a rip.

388
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,071
[Nate] What are you doing?
Get your hand out of there.

389
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,570
[Ben] Wait a minute,
there's something...

390
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,613
[Nate] Get away from him!

391
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,578
[Ben] What the hell was that?

392
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,760
It was a rock.

393
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,340
Must have happened
when I was dragging him out.

394
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,850
- I don't know.
- [Nate] Let's get out of here.

395
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,601
All right, we're almost
at the point of no return, Ben.

396
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,731
If we don't go now,
we'll end up just as dead.

397
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,108
[Static]

398
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,362
I don't like this.
Someone died up here...

399
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,242
Enough.

400
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,501
This is a secure line.

401
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,961
I'm just talking to you, right,
Tommy?

402
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,717
<i>[Thomas] That's affirmative, Nate.</i>

403
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,721
The Russians have been to the moon.

404
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,598
<i>[Thomas] Say again?</i>

405
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,510
The Russians have landed
on the south pole.

406
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,475
We found their LK Proton Lander,

407
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,357
but it didn't end well
for the cosmonaut.

408
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,190
<i>- You find a crash site?
- They didn't crash.</i>

409
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,114
We found his body in a crater.

410
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,318
<i>You found a dead cosmonaut?</i>

411
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,328
You tellin' me you didn't know this?

412
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,375
We land less than two clicks
from a Soviet LK,

413
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,207
and you expect me to believe
you didn't know they were here?

414
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,463
<i>You know they scrubbed their
manned flight program in'69,</i>

415
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,502
<i>That's the official word.</i>

416
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,510
Did you know they were here?

417
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,346
<i>- Tommy?
- This is a DOD mission, Nate.</i>

418
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,517
<i>I'm just briefed in on what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.</i>

419
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:32,359
You get that little prick
from DOD to give me a call.

420
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,697
<i>Get some rest. I'll get the DOD
over here and we'll talk to you soon.</i>

421
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,864
- [Nate] Tommy's a straight shooter.
- No.

422
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,533
I knew something was wrong
from the beginning.

423
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,452
[Nate] All right, what are you thinking?

424
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,168
DOD takin' over,
lyin' to our families.

425
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,877
Then they're rushing us
up here for what?

426
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,293
What, to set up
some listening devices?

427
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,929
[Nate] Yeah. Makes no sense.

428
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,841
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
I mean, that was our president,

429
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:05,479
for Christ sakes, and you don't think
that DOD would just lie to us?

430
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,810
[Nate] So, what are we
doing up here then?

431
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,393
What are we really doing?

432
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,526
[John] Well,
it's kind of spooky, really.

433
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,955
Strange beauty on the backside.

434
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,164
I don't know if it's my
mind playin' tricks on me,

435
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,331
but every so often you look
out these little windows and...

436
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,841
...get this sense that something
might be lookin' back...

437
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,593
...back at you.

438
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,503
[Beeping, light static]

439
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,267
[beeping increases slightly]

00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,981
[static, interference]

441
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,256
- [static]
- [power fluctuating]

442
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,580
Nate, look at this.

443
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,419
- What?
- Look at this!

444
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,884
The flag's gone.

445
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,594
[Ben] No, this isn't right.

446
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,100
[Nate] Houston, this is 18, over.

447
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,016
Houston, Liberty.

448
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,399
Did you see anything unusual
on the Westinghouse last night?

449
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,979
<i>[Thomas] Uh... We got some
interference and dropouts.</i>

450
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,402
Our flag is gone.

451
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,692
<i>Say again?</i>

452
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,575
<i>[Transmission distorted] Say again.</i>

453
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,079
Maybe the other cosmonaut took it.

454
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,716
<i>[John] If there was another cosmonaut,
he'd be away from his LK for, what,</i>

455
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,719
<i>a minimum of ten, 12 hours?</i>

456
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,215
<i>- [Nate] What are you thinkin', John?
- [John] There's no way.</i>

457
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,429
<i>He couldn't carry that kind of oxygen.</i>

458
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,435
So how could he survive?

459
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,105
<i>[John] Maybe there is no he.</i>

460
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,436
[Nate] You saying the Soviets
flew a one-man mission?

461
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,567
<i>[John] Wouldn't be the first time.</i>

462
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,321
If there's one cosmonaut,
who took the flag?

463
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,108
Who killed the other cosmonaut
that we found?

464
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,494
[Nate] We need to get
DOD on the line. Now.

465
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:53,829
<i>[Man] We suspected the Soviets might
be there, but we had no confirmation.</i>

466
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,163
<i>Intelligence warned that they
might be disguising missions</i>

467
00:33:56,326 --> 00:34:00,627
<i>- as routine satellite launches.
- Why the hell didn't you tell us?</i>

468
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,760
<i>National security. We play our cards
pretty close to the vest, Commander.</i>

469
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,295
<i>I'm sure you can understand.</i>

470
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,636
Maybe a little too close.

471
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,558
<i>We were concerned they might get
their eye in the sky up there first.</i>

472
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,938
<i>It would be
a national security disaster.</i>

473
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,316
So where the hell's
this other cosmonaut?

474
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,403
What, they're just
gonna leave him here?

475
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,691
<i>Our intelligence suggests
there was only one cosmonaut.</i>

476
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,858
<i>- Goddamn!
- Setup's complete.</i>

477
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,369
<i>It's time to get
you boys home again.</i>

478
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,994
So that's it?

479
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,629
Let's focus on getting home.
We'll ask questions later.

What the hell was that?

485
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,431
Let's get outta here.

486
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,442
<i>[Man] Roger. DAP looks good.</i>

487
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,444
Ten seconds.

488

<i>- Ten seconds. Ready on my mark.
- [man] Ten, nine...</i>

489
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,076

Shit! We are no go!
We are no go!

493
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,794
- Safe this damn thing.
- I'm trying!

494
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,089
- I've got a major power glitch.
- We're losing the descent oxygen.

- We got a leak somewhere!
- I'm gonna try and isolate the tanks

496
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,643
and see if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?

497
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,020
- Repeat, Houston, do you copy?
- Engine arm off!

498
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,854
We've lost comm.
Prop valves, closed.

499
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,439
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- What the hell is going on?

500
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,776
No. Houston, this is Liberty. Over.

503
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,215
[Nate] We just lost communications.

504
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,093
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

505
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,933
Impact on the LM, maybe a meteorite?

506
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,973
There's no way to tell
without going EVA.

507
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,023
- Give me a hand with the PLSS.
- You sure about this?

508
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,110
We need comm to get home.
Can't just stay in here and wait.

509
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,242
- Look, I can play with the omni...
- Suit up!

510
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,822
[Nate] Leaving egress platform.

Commander Walker is performing
an unscheduled EVA

515
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,761

on the Rover.

516

We've experienced...

[Broadcast echoing]

519
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,735
[Nate] Looks like the hull's
insulation is damaged.

520
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,741
Could be debris from the impact,
but I don't see any meteor residue.

521
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,834
- This is ripped to pieces.
- [Ben] Something hit us?

522
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,294
[Nate] I can't tell.

523
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:33,336
[Ben] We get that same feedback
each time we use active comm.

524
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,378
[Nate] Sounds like crossover
chatter from another frequency.

525
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,845
I can't squelch it.
I've never heard anything like it.

526
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,850

- [Nate] Wait, wait.

527
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,569
[Ben] Nate, talk to me.
What do you see?

528
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,525
[Nate] Looks like tracks.

529
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,533
[Ben] Footprints? Maybe there
is another cosmonaut.

530
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,943

533
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,794
We're witnessing
what could be evidence...

534
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,957
...of extraterrestrial contact.

535
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,966

[Ben] Do you know what you're saying?

538
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,306
[Nate] These tracks are not human.

539
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,103
I found the flag.

540
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,314
It's shredded.

541
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,151
And the motion-sensor camera is gone.

542
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,326
S-Band looks OK, just got knocked.

543
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,781
I'm turning the Rover back up.

544
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,765

Try to reach Houston or Freedom.

Get back to the LM!

557

- Nate, come back to the LM, OK? Nate?

558
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,482
- I can't get it out!
- There's nothing inside your suit.

559
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,318
- Now, get back to the ship!
- [Nate] it's in my helmet!

to do with those PSD5s.

aren't the source of the problem.</i>

I was repairing the S-Band.

I thought I saw something...

I was wrong.

Those PSD5s... [clearing throat]

665
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,967
What if they're not there
for spying on the Russians?

666
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,672
[Nate] What do you mean?

667
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,509
Look, they told us
that the transmitters

668
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,144
would pick up an ALSEP frequency,
but they don't.

669
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,728
They're blocking our comm.
They're emitting a signal.

[Nate] All right.

673
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,612
But why would they be doing that?

674
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,659
No, keep filming. Keep filming.
You need to document this.

675
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:37,002
To attract the things that made
the tracks that you saw.

676
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,799
Whatever killed the cosmonaut.

677
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,263
All these cameras, Ben...

678
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,190
...they're watching it.

679
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,815
We're on our own.

680
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,522
We're guinea pigs.

681
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,242
That's why they sent us up here.

682
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,496
We gotta dismantle those transmitters.

683
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,954
PSD5's destroyed.

684
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,214
There's debris everywhere.

685
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,009
Look at these tracks.

686
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,645
Nate, they were here.

687
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,728

It's gone.

695
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,650
- [Nate wheezing]
- Nate, we're too late.

696
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,112
This was a bad idea.

697
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,775
You need to get your rest, Nate, OK?
We're gonna get you back to the LM.

698
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,880
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.

699
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,630
It's entered your bloodstream.

700
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:52,308
[Ben] Previous wound seems to...
have become infected.

701

Eyes appear extremely bloodshot.

702
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,696
I don't know how to treat this.

703
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,823
Houston, this is Freedom. I haven't
been able to reach Nate or Ben.

No, they'll get us back.

They have to get us back.
They want that footage.

- That poor Russian bastard.

He was infected, just like me.

- No.

to have brought on fatigue.

We're not gonna make it here.

We'll abandon Liberty,
