1
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,632
THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE

2
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,874
YOUNG WOMAN MYSTERIOUSLY MURDERED!
THIRD IN LITTLE OVER A MONTH!

3
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,753
"Ll Giorno", please. Thanks.

4
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,754
The usual garbage!

5
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,676
- Come on, Carlo, we'll be late!
- Relax! They'll wait.

6
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,793
- The thing you wrote was a success
with the experts. - I'm glad.

7
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,950
Sam Dalmas,
great hope of American literature,

8
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,470
now writing manuals
on the preservation of rare birds.

9
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,116
- Be funny if I won a prize forit.
- How's Giulia? - Fine.

10
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,516
She's out of town on a modeling
job. She'll be back tonight.

11
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,836
- How are things going?
- Very well.

12
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,872
- I'm taking herback to the States
with me. - Really serious.

13
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,115
- Looks like it.
- Good morning. - 'Morning.

14
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,711
Back home I'll look for
a friend of mine to return a favor.

15
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,270
I was going through a bad period,
a little short on inspiration.

16
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,950
"Go to Italy", he said, "you need
peace, tranquility, that's Italy".

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,037
"Inspiration'll come to you.
Nothing everhappens in Italy!"

18
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,713
May he roast in hell!
Anyway, I came. I believed it!

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,477
Saw the country and the monuments,
then spaghetti, the atmosphere...

20
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,913
Great! Only I'm dead broke! And I
haven't written a line in 2 years.

21
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,669
I wouldn't have the plane fare home
if you didn't give me this job.

22
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,438
Which you carried out beautifully!

23
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,472
Here's your check, Mister Dalmas.

24
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,757
- Hey, Sam, don't you want a copy?
- Who needs it? I have this!

25
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,435
Hey! Open the door!

26
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,071
Hey! Hey!

27
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,232
How do I open the door?

28
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,995
I can't get in!
How do I open the door?

29
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,350
Hang on, just hang on!

30
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,715
Open the door!

31
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,795
Call the police!

32
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,398
I called the police!

33
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,515
Herpulse is weak but
it wouldn't appearto be serious.

34
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,597
She hasn't lost too much blood.

35
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,430
- Okay, get on with it. - Yes, sir.
- Check forfingerprints. - Okay.

36
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,795
Good evening.

37
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,231
- I'm inspector Morosini.
Tell me about it. - What's that?

38
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,353
What happened? I want to know
everything you saw and you heard.

39
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,393
- How is she? - She'll be
alright, thanks to you.

40
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,752
- What's yourname? - Sam Dalmas.
- Are you English? - No, American.

41
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,758
I was walking in front of the
gallery and I saw these lights.

42
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,997
I looked up here and I saw
these two figures struggling.

43
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,158
Put her down carefully.

44
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,833
- She was so good. - Let me through
I'm the owner of the gallery.

45
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,871
Monica!

46
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,831
Monica.

47
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,911
Monica.

48
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,392
- What happened?
- She's in no state for questions.

49
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,353
- Is it serious? - No, nothing
serious, just a flesh wound.

50
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,233
- Monica.
- Come on. - Let go of me.

51
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,670
I'm Alberto Ranieri, she's my wife.

52
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,400
- Excuse me. - Speak to me, what
happened? - You're tiring her.

53
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,513
- Dear, who did it? Who?
- We don't know.

54
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,509
- I hope yourwife may be able
to tell us... - Right, we'll go.

55
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,998
What was she doing in the gallery
at this time of night?

56
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,036
She was going overthe books,
I was supposed to pick herup.

57
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,713
- Monica!
- Go ahead!

58
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,794
- Stand back. Let the stretcher
through. - Poor girl!

59
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,519
- Stand back now, please!
- Right, that's it.

60
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,675
- Where were we? - There were
something wrong with that scene.

61
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,598
Something odd.

62
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,032
I can't pin it down, but I have a
feeling that something didn't fit.

63
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,632
- Think about it. Isolate it.
- I've tried, I can't pin it down.

64
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,038
Let's see if I can help. You saw
someone run out through this door.

65
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,392
Yeah. But it was so dark
underhere, the doorwas almost...

66
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,195
Don't touch anything! Try keeping
yourhands in yourpockets.

67
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,950
Just to avoid temptation.
It saves time and trouble.

68
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,949
On the mezzanine was noted a statue
of a warrior, a bronze on the wall

69
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,390
and a sculpture resembling
a branch of a petrified tree.

70
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,637
On the ground floor
an irregulartrail ofblood stains

71
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,074
from the service door at the rear
to within 10 feet the front window.

72
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,277
Apart from that there's no other
sign of a struggle. You got that?

73
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,598
- According to you, she came down
these stairs. - She did.

74
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,393
Now we'll measure
from the window to the stairs.

75
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,718
Blood.

76
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,753
I've had it, I can't take anymore!

77
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,070
We've been through
the whole damn thing six times!

78
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,273
I've told you everything,
every detail...

79
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,952
I don't know that woman,
I'd never seen herbefore.

80
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,993
Let's start over again, maybe
there's a detail you've forgotten.

81
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,828
Let's go back to this strange
figure you saw, describe it.

82
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,829
It was dark, I was too far away,
it was nothing but a dark figure.

83
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,954
I'm tired, I leave for America
in two days and I got a lot to do.

84
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,709
- Really? Have you made
the reservation? - Yes.

85
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,832
- Have you yourpassport on you?
- Yeah.

86
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,078
- May I have a look at it
a moment? - Yes.

87
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,671
Thank you.

88
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,515
- Hey!
- Hey what? - My passport.

89
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,429
- We'll take care ofit. - You're
kidding! I can't move without it.

90
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,393
We don't want you to. You're
too important to us as a witness.

91
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,592
You saw something which, though you
can't recall it, is clearly vital.

92
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,950
And until this point is cleared up,
I can't allow you to leave.

93
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,389
I didn't mind coming here, but...

94
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,754
During the past month there have
been three unexplained murders.

95
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,148
The victim were women, three crimes
without any apparent motive.

96
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,911
It's clearto me that there's
a dangerous maniac at large here.

97
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,033
What makes the inquiry difficult,
as far as we're concerned,

98
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,436
and it's forthis reason
we require your cooperation,

99
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,555
it's I'm certain this man is, as
far as his appearance goes, sane.

100
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,311
In his daily life he's completely
normal, like anybody else.

101
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,750
- Even like you.
- Me? - Yes, like you, why not?

102
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,471
Let's suppose you're insane:
You entered there and attacked her.

103
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,595
But when you tried to escape you're
casually trapped between the doors.

104
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,794
You're crazy! You can't grab a
foreigner and accuse him of murder.

105
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,991
- No one's accusing you. - Giving
me the third degree. It's illegal!

106
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,032
I want to call my consulate!

107
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,911
Go ahead. Call anyone you want.
Call the president of America.

108
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,153
- Atough nut. - Just humorhim...
- Here's a copy of Monti's report.

109
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,831
TWA? I want to cancel
a reservation. Sam Dalmas.

110
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,719
Number one twelve,
New York, day aftertomorrow.

111
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,751
Yeah, thank you.

112
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,758
Look out behind!

113
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,271
- Are you hurt? Can I help you?
- Don't worry, I'm okay. Thanks.

114
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,070
Wow! That's the most enthusiastic
welcome I've everhad.

115
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,590
Hey! It's been a month now.

116
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,959
You had a hard day at the office,
dear?

117
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,917
No, I just witnessed
an attempted homicide.

118
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,636
I was given the third degree
by the police,

119
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,673
I had my passport confiscated,
so we can't leave,

120
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,238
and just now I had my head nearly
decapitated by a meat cleaver.

121
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,477
You know, the usual.

122
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,115
Now you just tell me all about it.

123
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,835
Funny thing it's this is the truth.

124
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,350
Bring in the perverts. Look at them
and see if you recognize anyone.

125
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,155
The murderer'd have gone back to
the gallery to see if she was dead

126
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,239
and we can't rule out the
possibility that he is a pervert.

127
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,391
Aldo Sarti, age 42,
eight convictions.

128
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,639
Sandro Larrani, age 35,
exhibitionist, twelve arrests.

129
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,869
Mario Zandri, age 66,
four convictions.

130
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,189
Giacomo Rossi, age 50, three
convictions for corrupting minors.

131
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,559
Rubatelli Luigi,
alias Ursula Andress.

132
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,310
- No! Petrini! - Yes? - What's
this character doing here?

133
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,354
How many time did I tell you Ursula
belongs with the transvestites?

134
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,394
- I should hope so! - Come, I have
something interesting to show you.

135
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,433
We have subjected this glove
to a microscopic examination

136
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,234
and we came up
with a few interesting facts.

137
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,717
The blood stains are of
the same group as Monica Ranieri's

138
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,514
from which we deduce the murder
was wearing it at the time.

139
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,190
These grains are tobacco ash from
which we can tell he smokes cigars.

140
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,315
The traces of tobacco on the glove
are peculiar of Havana cigars.

141
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,796
This was our
most exciting discovery.

142
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,198
Microscopic particles of a type
of fibermade only in England.

143
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,630
- We found it inside.
- That's a good start anyway.

144
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,435
That means that we now know
he's a man who smokes cigars,

145
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,268
who dresses with elegance
and who is left handed.

146
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
We deduced it
from the wear on the glove.

147
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,631
Now we feed what we discovered into
the computer and get the result.

148
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,877
- Have you done that, yet? - Yes.
- Good, then we'll have a look.

149
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,390
This is an outline
of the man we are after,

150
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,035
reconstructed with an accuracy
of plus orminus 10%.

151
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,913
In a moment will follow
the first personal data.

152
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,669
Statistically speaking,

153
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,111
the description could fit about
150.000 inhabitants of this city.

154
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,951
Of those, most of the ones we feel
are the most likely, are in jail.

155
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,718
What're you waiting for?

156
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,834
Do you think it's easy to check
the alibi of 150.000 people?

157
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,112
I've got nothing to go on.
It's only a hunch.

158
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,518
But I'm sure that you really did
see the murderer's face that night.

159
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,109
- But I told you...
- Concentrate, Mr. Dalmas, please!

160
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,630
Try to rememberwhat you saw.

161
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,470
No, it's not use. I've run
through it over and over again.

162
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,594
I can't get it out of my head,
but I can't manage to pin it down.

163
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,515
Monica Ranieri
has left the hospital

164
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,475
and returned to her apartment
in the via Bruxelles, number35.

165
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,238
Can I go now?

166
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,872
- What floor?
- Third.

167
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,472
I'm really sorry, Mr. Dalmas,
but my wife can't see anybody.

168
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,239
She's under sedation at the moment.

169
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,558
You understand
afterwhat she's been through.

170
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,157
What did you want
to speak to her about?

171
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,228
Nothing much. I just wanted
to talk to her about that evening.

172
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,513
I'm convinced I saw something that
may lead to the attacker's capture.

173
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,712
I wanted to check what I remember
with what yourwife remembers.

174
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,958
My wife has already told the police
everything she knows several times.

175
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,879
I can see no reason for subjecting
herto that ordeal again.

176
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,911
I see.

177
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,554
- May I ask you a question?
- Certainly. - How tall are you?

178
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,390
Six feet one, I think. Why?

179
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,910
- Nothing, just curious.
- Anything else? - No.

180
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,236
I apologize if I've disturbed you.
Looking foryour cigarettes?

181
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,271
- Yes.
- Here!

182
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,588
Be seeing you, Mr. Ranieri.

183
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,990
- Didn't I tell you not to bet
that horse? - Yes, I know.

184
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,759
One's no good,
you gotta get two orthree to...

185
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,671
- First victim. - Right.
- Sales girl in an antique shop.

186
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,874
- She left at the same time and was
found murdered in a park. - Park.

187
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,756
It was a mile from the shop in the
opposite direction from herhome.

188
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,316
- First question. - What?
- Why so far away and in a park?

189
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,875
She could have gone to meet
herboyfriend. Second victim.

190
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,711
Atart, she was killed under a
bridge where she took her clients.

191
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,632
They suspected herpimp. His name's
Garullo, but his alibi is ironclad.

192
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,070
Where can I find this Garullo?

193
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,350
- You can't, he's in jail. At least
he was a month ago. - Great.

194
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,073
- Okay, numberthree.
- Numberthree.

195
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,714
- That was a student.
- Student.

196
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,231
- She was killed on her
way home from the movies. - Movies.

197
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,271
Okay?

198
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,511
Enough?

199
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,352
Okay, we start with the first one,
that antique shop.

200
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,349
- Good morning.
- Good morning. - Can I help you?

201
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,155
- Yes, I'd like to see something...
- You're interested in porcelain.

202
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,990
You have marvelous taste.
These peaces are beautiful.

203
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,634
Simply divine.

204
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,070
- How much is this one?
- Three hundred.

205
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,596
But I won't be unreasonable
about it. Not with you.

206
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,869
My goodness.

207
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,910
- Isn't this the shop where
that girl worked? - Pardon me?

208
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,509
The girl who was murdered.

209
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,599
The poor, poor girl.
What a terrible way to end.

210
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,629
- What was she like? - Lovely
girl. But a little unusual.

211
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,557
Yes, it was said
that she preferred women.

212
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,833
- I couldn't care less.
- Of course not. - I'm not racist!

213
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,872
I rememberthat night
as ifit were yesterday.

214
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,388
We hadn't made a sale all day!

215
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,958
Then just before we closed, we sold
a painting that was in the window.

216
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,120
- Did you make the sale? - No, the
girl did. I was checking the books.

217
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,154
And then she went out
without even say goodnight.

218
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,150
Soon after, they found her.

219
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,399
- What was the painting?
- It was strange.

220
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,675
Naive but macabre at the same time.
Would you like to see it?

221
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,077
- You still have it? - I've
only a copy, we took a photo.

222
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,112
I would like to see it.

223
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,078
I will show you.

224
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,592
Let me see, here it is!

225
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,432
- Can I borrow it? - No, we don't
normally allow that. - Please?

226
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,156
- Hey, what's wrong? - I don't
know, that painting. It bothers me.

227
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,635
What is it?

228
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,958
It's a photo of a painting that
somebody mixed up in the murderers.

229
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,992
Looks a little perverted to me.

230
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,151
Darling!

231
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,277
It gives me the shivers.

232
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,876
- Thanks, sergeant.
- Forget it. - Look!

233
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,549
- Something wrong, Miss?
- No, nothing, thanks.

234
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,239
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss.

235
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,031
No! No!

236
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,591
No!

237
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,951
No!

238
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,871
No!

239
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,951
No!

240
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,234
Tell me something.
Is it really necessary?

241
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,068
- What? - Running around
playing the detective?

242
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,955
Isn't it slightly ridiculous
and rather dangerous too?

243
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,273
- Nah!
- Thank you.

244
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,791
I feel I'm closerto the truth
than either one of us realizes.

245
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,716
What's happening to me? This damn
thing is turning into an obsession.

246
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,712
- Who is it?
- Morosini.

247
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,391
- Hello. How are things?
- Fine, come in.

248
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,111
For a minute out there I thought
I'd got the wrong address.

249
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,994
- Doesn't anyone else
live in this building? - No.

250
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,952
They're going
to tearthe building down soon.

251
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,994
My lease doesn't run out
till next week, so I'm staying on.

252
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,675
- Care for a coffee?
- Thanks I would.

253
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,270
In fact it's just what I need.
I've been up all night.

254
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,918
Thanks.

255
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,834
How come?

256
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,111
Here.

257
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,872
- When?
- Last night.

258
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,030
A blonde, 28, lived alone.

259
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,757
The usual blank wall. No clues,
no tie in with the otherthree.

260
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,633
The press is putting
two and two together.

261
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,071
They think they see a link
between the fourmurders.

262
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,116
- Giulia, this is
inspector Morosini. - Good morning.

263
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,359
Excuse me, I think we've met
somewhere before.

264
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,872
- No, I'm sure we haven't.
- Hey, look at this. - Not another.

265
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,791
As you may've suspected, there is
an ulteriormotive formy visit.

266
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,230
I would like you to come down
to headquarters with me.

267
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,910
- Why don't you just leave him
alone? - No. - Let me finish.

268
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,396
He isn't even Italian and
you're making him risk his life.

269
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,718
They tried to kill him. What makes
you so sure they won't try again?

270
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,150
You're blackmailing him,
you're hanging onto his passport

271
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,636
and at the same time you're
appealing to his humane instincts.

272
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,671
Shall we go?

273
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,152
Take care, won't you?

274
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,951
I'm sorry.

275
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,030
- Alright, now then.
- Now then, nothing!

276
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,471
I've gone over and over,
absolutely nothing.

277
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,794
I saw them struggling on the
mezzanine. That's as far as I get.

278
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,070
I can't think of anything else.
But I know there's something.

279
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,350
- Thanks.
- What are yourplans?

280
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,992
I think
I'll stick around for a while.

281
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,828
Need any help
foryourinvestigations?

282
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,439
- I thought I was being followed.
- Foryour own protection.

283
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,238
Yes, I would like some help.
I'd like to see that pimp Garullo.

284
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,229
- That's easy. - They've arrived
forthe television interview.

285
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,478
I'll make a fool of myselfin front
of millions television viewers.

286
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,479
- What'll you say? - I don't know,
I'll make up some spectacularlies.

287
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,157
That briefly is the situation.

288
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,512
Forthe moment I can only say
that we have certain information

289
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,553
which I am sure
will soon lead us to the murderer.

290
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,195
I urge all citizen to remain calm

291
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,075
and report anything suspicious to
the police immediately, thank you.

292
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,952
Get back to me as soon as you can,
let me know if you need anything.

293
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,798
Inspector Morosini?

294
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,472
- Hello? - I wanted you to know
how much I enjoyed yourtalk on TV.

295
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,150
- Who's this? - Who, but the
person you are so anxious to find.

296
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,591
- The unknown the city fears!
- Tape the call on Morosini's line.

297
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,998
You got no clue. Not a suspicion,
you know that and so do I.

298
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,998
It isn't right to trick the public.

299
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,352
I'm not scared, you'll have a 5th
murderbefore the end of the week.

300
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,391
Hello?

301
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,993
- Careful, it's heavy! - It's one
of the best example of cosmic art.

302
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,873
But we never stand still,

303
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,356
in some days we're opening a show
of sculptures and bass reliefs.

304
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,269
- You'll be changing everything.
- We'll replace everything. Yes.

305
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,074
- Mr. Ranieri? - Yes? - Would you
take a look to check the position?

306
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,274
Yes, I'll be with you. Will you
excuse me? Nice seeing you here.

307
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,311
Nice to see you, too.

308
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,395
I want to thank you
forwhat you did forme that night.

309
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,558
They said if you hadn't been there
that madman would've killed me.

310
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,989
I'm betternow, but...

311
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,589
It was so frightening that I don't
think I'll ever quite forget it.

312
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,590
- Please, come here. - Thank you.
- Not at all. - Good-bye, thanks.

313
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,878
What do you think
of placing it like this?

314
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,629
It's not perfectly vertical, but
from below you can see it better.

315
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,956
Yes, of course, you're right.

316
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,352
Yeah, she was my girl so long.

317
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,593
Where are you going?

318
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,430
- You said "so long".
- I always said that.

319
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,110
If I don't I stutter.

320
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,233
- I see.
- What do you wanna know?

321
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,912
I'm trying to help the police
find the killer.

322
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,909
That's good, so long.
But I don't know what to tell you.

323
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,829
They picked me up a week after
Rosita was murdered, poorkid.

324
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,396
There I am in jail and those girls
have to get along without me.

325
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,434
No protection, with that monster
loose on the streets.

326
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,752
- What've they got you in for?
- Nothing. I was framed.

327
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,319
They got it in forme. They say I'm
aiding and abetting prostitution.

328
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,038
But I'm innocent. Look at me,
do I look like a pimp?

329
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,313
Look me in the eyes, do I look
like a guy who exploits women?

330
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,388
I got nothing against accepting
present every now and then, right?

331
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,436
- Sure. Can you give me any help?
- It wasn't nobody in my bunch.

332
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,472
We don't play those games.

333
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,431
It must've been some rich guy.
You know, a gentleman.

334
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,473
They're the ones
who get those kind ofideas.

335
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,072
These guys have
a particular code ofhonor,

336
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,033
which is very different
from anything anybody else has.

337
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,231
- And this particular... - That
man's been following us forhours.

338
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,273
He's Morosini's man,
he's ourbodyguard.

339
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,838
It would appearthat this guy "So
long" has got kind of a harem...

340
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,670
- Hey, taxi!
- Well, I feel like walking.

341
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,913
"So long" expects everything
from women and nothing from men.

342
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,909
Stop!

343
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,474
No!

344
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,111
Run! Run!

345
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,992
All right, you wait here.

346
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:58,110
Go in there, it's me they're after.
When you get away, call Morosini.

347
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,357
- There's a guy with a gun
afterme. - I don't see anyone.

348
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,790
- There he is!
- Who is he?

349
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:05,032
Mrs. Johnson.

350
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,914
Excuse me, have you seen a man with
a yellow jacket and a blue cap?

351
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,839
- Yes, sir.
- Where did he go? - In there.

352
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,076
I gave his liver a good working
over. To the tenth I laid him out.

353
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,350
Yeah, I rememberthat.

354
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,793
It's about time we began talking
about some of the problems we face.

355
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,038
Pipe down, will you? There's the
problem of the insurance coverage.

356
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,552
The indemnity forpermanent
disability... Listen to me!

357
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,198
He had a glass jaw!

358
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,633
He died without consciousness.
Fractured spine and skull.

359
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,752
Do you think
you could recognize him?

360
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,797
I didn't see his face clearly.

361
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,395
I want every man at that convention
tracked down.

362
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,115
I want pictures, criminal records,
every particularyou can dig out.

363
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,153
I want two of ourtop men detailed
to coverthe two behind us,

364
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,192
they're to be watched
day and night.

365
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,358
I'm very sorry
to have got you into this mess.

366
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,632
Take my advice,
go back to the United States.

367
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,519
I feel that I'm getting closer
to the truth every minute.

368
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,472
The murdereris obviously
of the same opinion.

369
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,478
That's why he's trying to kill me.

370
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,512
The more he tries,
the more he risks discovery.

371
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,599
Stop,
let's see your driving license.

372
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,033
- We had great fun. - I'll arrange
things so we can stay together.

373
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,075
- I love you.
- Me too.

374
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,189
- Bye!
- Bye, Gina.

375
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:31,880
The sons ofbitches, they
really tried to get you, so long.

376
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,836
- Yeah. And I wanna find him.
- Sure, I'll help you, so long.

377
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,871
Let me think.

378
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,156
Yeah, that's it.
I know the guy foryou?

379
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,990
- Who? - He ain't cheap, but
there's nothing he doesn't know.

380
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,793
- Okay.
- Hey!

381
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,473
This is strictly between
you and me. No police, so long.

382
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,114
Don't worry.

383
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:17,595
Call the Caramba pull hall and ask
for Faina. Say "So long" sent you.

384
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,517
Elevator, get an elevator...

385
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,552
- Who are you?
- I'm Faina.

386
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,270
Faina! Come on in!

387
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,438
I couldn't just made five flights.
I gotta work out.

388
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,152
- Who's that? - She's a friend,
you can trust her.

389
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,988
- Here, sit down.
- No, thanks.

390
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,197
Now get this straight, I don't know
anything, I don't know anybody.

391
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,394
And I don't see anything!
What do you want to know?

392
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,992
The othernight a man tried to kill
me with a pistol and a silencer.

393
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,073
He got away
and went to the Lux Hotel...

394
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,514
- What's the matter? - This place
bugged? - No, now listen to me.

395
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,916
There was a convention of ex prize
fighters. He was dressed like one.

396
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,192
- You want to turn him in, right?
- No, I wanna talk to him.

397
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,835
Can't help you... Hundred.

398
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,956
- Hundred what?
- Hundred thousand. - Oh, yeah!

399
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,111
Oh, come on!

400
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,351
Here.

401
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,351
No, keep it.

402
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,031
Ten, twenty, thirty... hundred.

403
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,229
- When will I hearfrom you?
- Never.

404
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,272
Maybe tomorrow morning.

405
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,311
Hello?

406
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,798
Yes?

407
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:21,312
Get smarter, Mr. Dalmas. Take my
advice, mind your own business.

408
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,071
Stop playing detective.
It's not healthy.

409
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:31,114
That was a warning yesterday.
Wasn't it enough?

410
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,435
- What do you suggest I do?
- Go back to America.

411
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,554
Forget about the murders.
There is a limit to my patience!

412
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,958
- Who's speaking? - Is
the girl there with you? - Yes.

413
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,471
She's young and very beautiful,
would you like herto die?

414
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,913
Because if you don't drop
everything I will kill her!

415
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,953
Go back to America. Forget about
the murders. There's a limit...

416
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,953
Did you hearthat creaking sound?
I want to know what it is.

417
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,834
What makes a sound like that?
It's all we have to go on.

418
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,269
I'll find out.

419
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,591
Well.

420
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,312
What are you gonna do now?

421
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,591
I don't know. It was simplerwhen
I only had myself to think about.

422
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,310
Damn painting.
There's got to be a lead somewhere.

423
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,353
- Maybe the first victim looks like
the woman. - Too roughly drawn.

424
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,198
It could be anybody.

425
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,755
- Hello? - This is Faina,
I couldn't find out anything.

426
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,634
But if you're interested there's
an ex-fighternamed Needles.

427
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,719
He might know something.
Lives not farfrom yourplace.

428
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,880
- Via Angiolieri, 39.
- Via Angiolieri, 39.

429
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,797
Hello?

430
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,714
Anyone home?

431
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,070
Now look at it on the oscilloscope.

432
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,394
I wanted you to know
how much I enjoyed yourtalk on TV.

433
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,592
Right.
Now we'll listen to the other one.

434
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,793
Be smart, take my advice,
mind your own business.

435
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,637
Notice any difference
between the tapes?

436
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,356
The waves on the first machine are
different from those on the second.

437
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,589
Exactly, every human voice, no
matterhow well it's disguised

438
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,953
has a peculiarpattern ofharmonic
intensities in the vowel sound.

439
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,197
When we analyzed the vowel groups
of each of these two tapes,

440
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,879
we made an unexpected discovery.

441
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,517
The first registered at 5 decibels
on the lowerrange and 12 high,

442
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:19,351
while the second reading it only
barely registered to 4 and 10.

443
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,912
- The explanation? - The voices
don't belong to the same person.

444
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,675
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

445
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,429
- That means there are
two killers! - It would seem so.

446
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,998
Unless it's one trying to confuse
us by dragging a partnerin.

447
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,113
In that case, he was no doubt
the one who tried to kill you.

448
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:46,837
- The one you found murdered. - Now
we listen to the sound you gave us.

449
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,759
We isolated the sound and compared
it with hundreds of similar ones.

450
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,839
We've exhausted the field of sounds
produced by industrial machinery,

451
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,919
factories, demolition sites,
through to electric doors, cranes,

452
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,839
coin operated machines,
domestic appliances.

453
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,475
But so far,
we've been unable to equate it.

454
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,958
- What now?
- All we can do is keep trying.

455
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,389
Okay, thank you.

456
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,670
- Sorry I won't be around
forthe finish. - You're leaving?

457
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,511
Day aftertomorrow.
I've said that before, haven't I?

458
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:33,194
Forty pages in the last days. This
adventure started me writing again.

459
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,357
- Glad to hearit. - It's broken
me loose. Here, pack these too.

460
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,073
I'm writing frantically again.

461
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:43,591
- Whateverhappened to those leads
you were following up? - Nothing.

462
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,438
Listen to this.

463
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,668
This came overthe telephone.

464
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,396
It'd have been a great lead if we
could've figured out what it was.

465
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:02,391
Go back home. Forget the murders.
There is a limit to my patience.

466
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,353
- Is the girl there with you?
She's pretty... - Hold it!

467
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,790
Let me hearit again, will you?

468
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,276
Dalmas!
There's a limit to my patience.

469
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,193
- Is the girl there with you?
She's very... - Well?

470
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,233
I don't know,
it reminds me of something.

471
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,670
- I guess I'm wrong.
- Great!

472
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,308
Wait a minute.
Leave it, I'll do it.

473
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,518
I don't believe it!

474
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,713
- I just can't believe it.
- What? - That we're leaving.

475
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,755
Listen, why don't I take the tape?

476
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,237
If I think of anything
I'll call you.

477
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,312
I'll call you.

478
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,791
So long!

479
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:14,033
These are the last few hours
in this house.

480
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,872
Do you really love me?

481
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,636
- Sure. How much time
have we got? - How much what?

482
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,834
- How long till the plane leaves?
- Eight hours. Why?

483
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,077
That may be just enough.

484
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,075
What do you want to do now? Sam!

485
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,399
- Hello! Is this the Trouvaille?
- Yes.

486
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,798
I'm Dalmas, I borrowed the picture
of the painting of that murder.

487
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,196
- Yes, I remember
you were so charming. - Yes.

488
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:08,394
- Can you tell me the name of the
artist? - Sure, Berto Consalvi.

489
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,830
Berto Consalvi.

490
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,473
- Where can I find him? - He lives
in a town not farfrom here.

491
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,830
- It's about an hour and a half
by train. - What's the name ofit?

492
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,955
- Aviano. - Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, it's a pleasure.

493
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,355
I can just make it,
I've got to talk to that painter.

494
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,109
The first girl was murdered
just afterhe sold that painting.

495
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,631
There's gotta be a connection. I'll
be back in 5 hours. Finish packing.

496
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,990
There's no need to worry so long
as you don't leave the house.

497
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,318
Two detectives are watching the
door. Bolt it and don't open it.

498
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:52,151
- I love you. - I never should have
believed you. I'm a fool!

499
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,311
If you need anything, call
Morosini. You know the number. No!

500
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,558
- Thanks forthe lift. It would've
been some walk! - You're welcome.

501
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:16,799
Get out ofhere, the man's crazy.
You neverknow what'll happen next.

502
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,831
- Thanks forthe advice.
- Follow it!

503
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,953
If you wanna carry on, you don't
need to go looking forthe door.

504
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,310
He'd been walled up,
the whole building, doors, windows.

505
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,353
- There's got a way to get in it.
- It doesn't mean he'll let you in.

506
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,110
If yourface ain't right, he'd
tell you what you can do with it!

507
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,071
Consalvi?

508
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,830
Berto Consalvi?

509
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,755
- Go to blazes.
- I want to buy a painting.

510
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,793
- What do you want it for?
- Formy house.

511
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,191
Hey!

512
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:33,114
- Why did you wall up yourhouse?
- To keep out the busybodies.

513
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,830
Nobody gets in here unless I want
them to! Besides there are cats.

514
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,237
Who told you about me?

515
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,513
Nobody, I saw one
of yourpaintings. I liked it.

516
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:05,954
- What was it? - It was one
about a murdererkilling a girl.

517
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,471
I don't do that crap anymore.

518
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,116
I'm going through
a mystical period.

519
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,473
- I only paint mystical scenes.
- Why?

520
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,110
Why? Because I feel mystical.
Lfit's any of your damn business.

521
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,958
No, no, it's not.

522
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,834
- What was yourinspiration for
that painting? - You wanna eat?

523
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,751
Yeah.

524
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:53,118
That was a real story
a long time ago.

525
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,558
Thanks, that's fine.

526
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:07,276
- How long?
- Ten years, more orless.

527
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,594
A maniac got hold of a girl I knew.

528
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,789
He tried to cut herup.

529
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,230
I just stopped him in time.

530
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,273
They put him in an asylum forlife.

531
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,111
Genius!

532
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,679
Hey,
you want to buy a painting ornot?

533
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,073
- Do you?
- Yeah. Sure.

534
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,509
Come with me.

535
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:00,511
I got just the thing.
Early Consalvi, very rare!

536
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,678
Hey! Shut the window!

537
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,910
There you are! Got you!

538
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,518
Naughty Theodore.

539
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:28,633
Blasted cats, crafty creatures.

540
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,195
They always manage to find a hole
to slip through

541
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,835
and they're always away in a flash.

542
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:48,275
- Why do you lock them up? - The
less they move the fatterthey get.

543
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,471
- Why do you wanna them
to get fat? - Why?

544
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,718
I eat them.

545
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,590
- Oh, no! - What's the matter?
Don't you like cats?

546
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,193
I don't know. I never ate any.

547
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,958
Never, huh?

548
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,153
- Here, take this one.
Two hundred thousand. - Oh, no!

549
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:23,433
- No? Alright,
one hundred and fifty. - Oh, no!

550
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,032
- A hundred!
- Oh, no!

551
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,518
Fifty thousand!

552
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,912
Get lost!

553
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,713
- Hello? - You still mad at me?
- Where are you?

554
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,753
- I'm at the station in Aviano on
my way home. - How did it go?

555
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,155
I talked to him,
but I didn't go anywhere.

556
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,159
There's a railway strike, I'll be
about an hour and a halflate.

557
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,159
- What about the plane? - Don't
worry I'll be there in time.

558
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,715
- Everything okay?
- Yes. - Carlo phoned.

559
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:06,595
- He discovered something.
- What? - He didn't say.

560
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,431
I told him you had left and you'd
call him as soon as you get back.

561
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,111
Sam...

562
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,391
Sam.

563
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,191
Sam?

564
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,312
You won't leave this house alive.

565
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,953
Help! Help! Help!

566
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,071
Help!

567
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,551
Help!

568
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,311
Giulia? Giulia!

569
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,191
Giulia!

570
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,153
Sam?

571
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:53,594
- How do you feel?
- Alright. Did they get him?

572
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,110
No, he must've slipped out through
the cellar or something.

573
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,430
What time is it?

574
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,474
Just after 4:30.
You slept around the clock.

575
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,633
Peeping Tom, huh? So sorry!

576
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:25,318
You were supposed to call me,
you know? I've got news foryou.

577
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,352
The phone's been out of order.

578
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,553
I think I've finally figured out
what that cracking sound is.

579
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,754
- It's peculiar. - What is it?
- The call of the Hornitus Nevalis.

580
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,555
A magnificent bird with long white
feathers that look like glass.

581
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,830
What's so strange about it?

582
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,908
The only place in the world that
bird can live is Northern Siberia.

583
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,152
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

584
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,989
How about a drink? I deserve one.

585
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:10,032
It's almost impossible to keep one
of those birds alive in captivity.

586
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,358
There's only one specimen in Italy
and that has to be kept...

587
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,153
- What's the matterwith you?
- Wait a minute.

588
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,556
- You mean there's one here?
- That's what I try to tell you.

589
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,592
It's practically a miracle but
they're managing to keep one alive.

590
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,872
- Where? - Where else would you
keep a rare bird? The zoo.

591
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,757
- The cage is nearthe back
of the zoo. - It's quite a walk.

592
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,473
It's not farnow.
They have to keep it isolated.

593
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,479
It doesn't get along with the other
animals. They have to move it.

594
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,308
It can't even stand the smell
of them. There it is!

595
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,269
Ranieri! He called from his flat.
I remembernow.

596
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,278
The telephone's
right next to that window.

597
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,311
Monica!

598
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,749
Come on, Giulia!

599
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,833
- Open the door!
- Right, leave it to us!

600
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,233
Give me the knife!

601
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,638
- Don't shoot.
- Let her go. - There's no way out.

602
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,028
Give yourself up.

603
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,435
- You can't get away.
- Drop the knife. - No!

604
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,598
- Don't move. There is no way out.
- No!

605
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,191
Drop the knife!

606
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,358
Keep away from me.

607
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,789
Keep away!

608
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,870
- That's enough!
- What has happened?

609
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,310
- Where'd he get you?
- Giulia! Come on!

610
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,231
Save me!

611
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,034
Please! I don't want to die!

612
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,069
Help me! I don't want to die!

613
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,720
I can't hold him.

614
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:50,989
Yes, it's true, I'm the murderer.

615
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:58,552
I killed all of them.
Please, take care of my wife.

616
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,309
She tried to stop me.

617
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,517
I loved her.

618
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,988
Poor devil, I feel sorry forhim.

619
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,678
Morosini here,
put me through the homicide.

620
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,709
- Have you seen the girl I was
with? - No, she was behind us.

621
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,196
- Isn't she here? - No.
Have you seen her since then?

622
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,231
No, I haven't.

623
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,391
Thanks.

624
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,549
- Have you seen a girl with blond
hair? - She came down a while ago.

625
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,672
- Sure? Which way did she go?
- She ran offin that direction.

626
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,712
- With two others.
- Thanks.

627
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,036
His head busted open
like a watermelon!

628
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,152
Excuse me, have you seen a girl
go by in that direction

629
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,159
with blond hair and a gray raincoat
came down to about here?

630
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,191
Sure.

631
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,190
Have you seen a girl with
blond hair and a gray raincoat?

632
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,030
- I saw her going there. - In
that door? - That's what I said.

633
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,671
Thanks.

634
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,518
- This one here?
- Yes.

635
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:21,153
Carlo! Oh, my God!
What have you done with Giulia?

636
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:23,311
Answerme!

637
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,234
It was you!

638
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,951
It's the otherway around.

639
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,917
Like a knife in yourhand. You were
trying to kill yourhusband.

640
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,997
It was the otherway around.

641
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,711
That's what I knew I've seen!

642
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,511
Help me.

643
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,631
Help me.

644
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,475
Now you're going to die!

645
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,550
You're going to die!

646
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:42,716
You're going to die!
Like all the others.

647
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,870
Right, come on, quick. Now, one
at each end. That's it, now lift!

648
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,117
That's enough, hold it!
No, I'll pull you.

649
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,354
That's it. Are you alright?

650
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:08,109
- How did you find out?
- Giulia.

651
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,151
Giulia?

652
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:16,511
Yes, she'll be alright.
And you'll be alright too.

653
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,154
Come on, I'll help you up.

654
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,995
As inspector Morosini, in charge of
the investigations, had told you,

655
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:29,149
the final curtain fell on what
kept the city in a state of shock.

656
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:33,671
Monica Ranieri is in custody
at the psychiatric hospital.

657
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:40,558
Herhusband lost his life in a last
attempt to turn suspicion on him.

658
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:46,391
What lead this unbalanced creatures
to commit horrible murders?

659
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,310
Good evening. Sorry.

660
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:04,515
The person best qualified to answer
this question is Professor Renoldi,

661
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:13,070
the well known psychiatrist who was
our consultant during the inquiry.

662
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,510
- Please, would you explain?
- Certainly.

663
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,074
Forthe moment
we can only make conjectures.

664
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,114
Ten years ago Monica Ranieri, who
had evident paranoid tendencies,

665
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:28,358
was brutally attacked
and suffered a severe trauma.

666
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,837
Still, she recovered sufficiently
to return to a normal life.

667
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,997
Hermental disturbance remained
dormant forten years.

668
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,637
Until she came across a painting
which depicted the horrible scene.

669
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,150
Herlatent madness came to life
violent and irresistible.

670
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:50,638
She didn't identify herself as
depicted, but with her attacker.

671
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:54,275
In orderto explain
the behavior ofherhusband,

672
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,676
who attempted murder
to protect his wife,

673
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,029
we must assume that he suffered
from an induced psychosis.

674
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:05,313
He was influenced by his wife
to become homicidally psychotic.

675
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:17,758
I can hearhim saying it now: "Go
to Italy it's a peaceful country".

676
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,792
"Nothing everhappens there."
