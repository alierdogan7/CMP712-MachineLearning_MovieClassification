          <i>( banging )</i>

144
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,198
       - ( bed squeaks )
       - <i>( man sighs )</i>

145
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,336
             Man:
        <i>This will be our</i>
     <i>abode for the evening.</i>

146
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,039
      <i>Clean up your mess,</i>
            <i>Harley.</i>

147
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,220
       What was your son's name?

148
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,123
    I said after.

149
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,127
        Well, these are actually
        two separate rooms

150
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,896
          and we already cleared
          that one, so...

151
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,236
           Andre.

152
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,707
        His name was
        Andre Anthony.

153
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,248
Make sure there
isn't a box of cookies
hiding in there.

154
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,919
              Did you have
              any other kids?

155
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,255
      Rules of the game,
          my friend.

156
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,996
        So?

157
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,397
       Did you?

158
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,134
           ( scoffs )
           You know, you could
           be a spy.

159
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:32,136
                Or a cop.

160
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,741
               ( sighs )

161
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,476
                  No.

162
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,412
         One was enough for me.

163
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,182
        And Andre was a handful,
        like you.

164
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:48,453
       Does this hallway
       count as a room?

165
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,222
           If you can find
           something we can use.

166
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,777
 This is the only thing
 I could find.

167
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,779
    Does it count?

168
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,115
              Technically, yes.

169
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,486
                    So?

170
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,891
  How long has it been?

171
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,398
      It happened after--

172
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,901
        you know, after
     everything happened.

173
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,806
    Does my dad know?

174
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,142
        Never told him.

175
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,513
             <i>Never told anyone</i>

176
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,415
        till just now.

177
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,391
          Your secret
       is safe with me.

178
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,296
   It's not really a secret.

179
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,567
   It's still safe with me.

180
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,431
                ( sighs )

181
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:01,539
           ( breathing heavily )

182
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,582
             Michonne?

183
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,254
 Everything okay?

184
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,323
             Yeah, it's fine.

185
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,731
  There's a baby in there.

186
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,333
                It's a dog.

187
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,682
  My dad let me name her.

188
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,557
      Maybe--

189
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,597
  maybe her and Andre
  are together somewhere.

190
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,676
                  <i>Come on.</i>

191
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,113
              <i>It's almost noon.</i>

192
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,416
    Your dad will wonder
    where we are if we're late.

193
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,793
        <i>( man snoring )</i>

194
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,463
  - <i>( indistinct chatter ) </i>
  <i>-</i> <i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

195
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,804
    -  <i>( snoring continues ) </i>
    <i>- Yo.</i>

196
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,106
 <i>( knocking )</i>

197
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,775
   Comfy?

198
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,446
      <i>You waking me up</i>
      <i>to see if I'm comfortable?</i>

199
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,780
 <i>I want to lie down.</i>

200
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,116
           <i>Two other bedrooms</i>
           <i>up here to choose.</i>

201
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,119
 <i>Them's kids' beds.</i>

202
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,455
I want this one.

203
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,558
      - <i>It's claimed. </i>
      <i>-</i> <i>I didn't hear it.</i>

204
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,160
 <i>You gonna have to lay</i>
 <i>claim somewhere else.</i>

205
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,666
 ( both grunting )

206
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:11,669
      <i>( punches landing )</i>

207
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,238
 ( groans )

208
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,715
   ( groans, coughs )

209
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,618
        Len!
        Len, stop!

210
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,425
        Stop, Len!

211
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,427
          - Stop!
          - <i>Hell, no.</i>

212
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:37,895
             <i>Stop!</i>

213
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,765
                 <i>( Len panting )</i>

214
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,211
 <i>My bed now, jackoff.</i>

215
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,547
        ( bed creaks )

216
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,786
                    ( groans )

217
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,190
                    ( sighs )

218
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,563
  Hey, don't move.

219
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,631
  Here's some water.

220
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,735
            Where are we?

221
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,270
    I don't know.

222
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,573
We were fighting biters
and you passed out

223
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,841
right after
we left the prison.
I didn't know what to do.

224
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,644
The back of the truck
seemed safer than
the side of the road.

225
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,280
          Hey, hey.
          Hey.

226
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,750
          Did we pass a bus?

227
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,587
         On the road,
         did we pass a bus?

228
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,822
         Yeah.

229
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,857
          What did you see?

230
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,830
          What did you see?

231
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,800
   They were all dead.

232
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,572
              How long since
              we passed it?

233
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,908
  Three hours.

234
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,280
         - Hey.
         - ( tapping )

235
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,616
         Hey, stop the truck.

236
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,988
   Hey, numbnuts,
   stop the truck.

237
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,791
             Stop the truck!

238
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,362
             Stop the truck!

239
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,848
Where the hell
are you going?

240
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,750
 Where the hell
 is he going?

241
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,752
  I don't know what your
  lady friend's told you

242
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,553
  about the special nature
  of the mission we're on,

243
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,855
      but this shit
      is time-sensitive

244
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,890
           and we're already
           way behind schedule.

245
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,827
       So I need you to turn
       your ass around and get
       back in the truck.

246
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,963
     - I gotta go.
     - It seems like
       neither one of you's

247
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,333
    been paying close enough
    attention to the hell on
    earth we've been living in.

248
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,670
 So let me tell you how
 to best avoid winding up
 just another dead-alive prick.

249
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,573
          You find some strong,
          like-minded comrades

250
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,043
     and you stay stuck together
     like wet on water.

251
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,812
                We need people.

252
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,848
         The more the better.
         We need each other,
         partner.

253
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,351
         Even with all that
         gear on your shoulder,
         you won't last a night.

254
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,687
              Not by yourself.

255
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,789
  I'll take my chances.

256
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,891
        I'm gonna have to insist

257
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,327
               that you hold
               the hell up.

258
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,028
             All right,
             believe it or not,

259
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,631
         the fate of the entire
         damn human race

260
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,933
          might depend on it.

261
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,405
    What the hell
    are you talking about?

262
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,775
     Who is this guy?

263
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,377
      I'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.

264
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,413
     And these are my companions
     Rosita Espinosa

265
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,115
        <i>and Dr. Eugene Porter.</i>

266
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:21,385
       We're on a mission to get
       Eugene to Washington, DC.

267
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,987
       Eugene's a scientist

268
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,024
       and he knows exactly
       what caused this mess.

269
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,671
       All right.

270
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,740
     So what happened?

271
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,380
         He'd been talking
         to the muckety-mucks
         in Washington

272
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,749
         on his satellite phone.

273
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,884
         The past couple weeks,

274
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,653
       nobody's been picking up
       on the other end.

275
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,390
       We saw how you handled
       those corpses back there.

276
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,894
        We could use your help.

277
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,803
        Sorry.

278
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,812
                 I had to get us
                 off that road.

279
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,081
         You were passed out,
         we were out of bullets.

280
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,683
      I know how to get
      back to that bus.

281
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,086
       I wrote down
       every turn.

282
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,990
     I will get you back
     if I can, okay?

283
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,992
    That's where
    she'd go to find me.

284
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:37,728
  - That's where I'm gonna go.
  - It's a waste of time.

285
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,431
          Tara told us
          what went down.

286
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,167
        There is zero chance
        you will ever find
        your wife again.

287
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,169
        Alive or dead.

288
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:47,805
   <i>Mainly because,</i>
   <i>sorry to tell you,</i>

289
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,840
