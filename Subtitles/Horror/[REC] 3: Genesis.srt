00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,610
A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY

2
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,723
Okay. We're going to film
my cousin Koldo,

3
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,330
who I'm sure is a little nervous

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,521
Auntie!

5
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,049
Koldo? Koldo?

6
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,204
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

7
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,361
Cousin!

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,724
Hey!

9
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,491
- What's up, Cousin?
- How are you?

10
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,091
- Great. What about you?
- Well... Can't you tell?

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,049
You're great! You look great!

12
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,321
And no rice...

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,767
No, don't throw rice.
The girl wants rose petals.

14
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,121
- How refined.
- Come on, give us a hand!

15
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,971
- Koldo! Koldito!
- Hey!

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,889
What are you doing lurking
around here?

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,411
Hey, do you remember
my cousin Adrián?

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,729
Of course I do. But the last time
I saw you, you were only knee high.

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,481
Hey, if you film any good-looking girls,
tell me, okay?

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,889
Speaking of the devil...
ls Natalie coming?

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,048
But aren't you even going to
give it a rest on my wedding day?

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,003
- But is she coming or not?
- She's already inside.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,201
Perfect!

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,363
Hey, who... Who's Natalie?

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,327
<i>Natalié, Natalié...
A les enfants de la patrie.</i>

26
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,486
Let's see. Look over there. Okay...

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,842
Look, the wedding video man!
Nice equipment!

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,808
Hey, what's this for?

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,050
That's for stabilizing the image and
creating cinema-quality movements.

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,005
Otherwise, with all this stuff on your
shoulder, the picture is unwatchable

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,009
Do they shoot films with this, too?

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,929
Here, some of them.
In America, all of them.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,446
All of them?

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,450
Look, look, look, look.
Cinema quality.

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,563
And what about your camera, kid?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,049
This one's got high-definition HD
with megapixels.

37
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,720
With megapixels?
Hey, can you do me a favour?

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,884
Could you get some shots inside,
being as how you're family?

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,764
Yeah, I'm going to film everything,
no worries.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,203
Film what the naked eye wouldn't see.
Dziga Vertov, Cinema verité...

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,328
Yeah, of course.
I swear to God I'll film everything.

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,647
- What's your name, sunshine?
- Adrián. And you?

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,922
- Atún.
- Okay. Pleased to meet you.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,484
Tita, put your cardigan on,
we're going.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,129
See you later, Estela.

46
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,169
- Have you got your keys?
- Yes, dear, don't worry.

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,441
And where's Clara?

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,363
Well, she's not upstairs.
I don't know.

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,403
- What do you mean, she's not upstairs?
- No.

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,885
Go and look for your sister
in the kitchen.

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,927
No, this way.

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,362
And put that camera away!

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,208
Oh...

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,531
Clara! Clara!

55
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,129
Clara, we're leaving!

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,805
Are you all right?

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,526
Tita, switch off the camera.
I've got something to tell you.

58
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,483
I think...

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,607
BL-'e!

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,167
Here's Koldo with uncle Pepe Victor.

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,328
Let's see what he's got to say.
He's always stirring it.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,488
Clara's great. If you change your mind,
I'll divorce your aunt...

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,364
-...and steal her from you.
- What are you talking about!

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,802
Well, that's great, Uncle.
Viva Valencia!

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,441
- Victor, Pepe Victor!
- I'm coming, Amparín, I'm coming!

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,321
Hey, Uncle, what happened
to your hand?

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,411
Don't say anything to your aunt.
A dog in the clinic...

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,364
- It looked like it was dead...
- What happened?

69
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,325
And it woke up and bam!
He just made a right mess of it.

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,966
- You mean it bit you?
- Yeah, but don't worry, I'm...

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,970
- Are you all right?
- Can't you tell? Eh?

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,526
- Come on! Pepe Victor, let's go!
- I've got a little something for you.

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,484
- I'll come and find you later, okay?
- Yeah, yeah...

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,202
Give it to me.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,447
I like filming.

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,407
Yeah...

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,291
Well, she's a bit nervous, of course

78
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,768
But she's really beautiful.
You should see her.

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,801
All right.

80
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,009
She's coming. Come on, she's on her way.
Everybody inside!

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,565
Come on, Koldo. Chin up!
Be brave!

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,522
Come on, get inside!

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,922
- Come on, inside!
- Come on, get moving!

84
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,486
- Where is he? Where's my father?
- Your father's inside.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,329
- With Mónica, Óscar and the kids.
- Okay, okay, come on...

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,608
Come on. Come on, let's go!
Everybody inside!

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,562
Go get 'em!

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,130
At the back!
Come on, let's get inside.

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,049
- Do you want one, Adri?
- No. No, thanks.

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,650
Rafa!

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,522
Hey! The boys are here!
Ha ha!

92
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,567
And the fool who's getting married?
Where's he got to, mate?

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,966
He's inside.
Where do you think?

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,650
Hey, kid!

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,886
Hey Rafita...

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,001
So good-looking...

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,885
Hey Charly! Inside!
Give us a hug!

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,650
There... Jumangi!

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,480
You're gorgeous!

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,606
And so, as you wish to enter
into matrimony, join hands...

101
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,525
Clara, take this ring, as a sign of
my love and my fidelity to you...

102
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,929
Koldo, take this ring, as a sign of
my love and my fidelity to you...

103
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,731
Oh...

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,968
<i>You've been tangled up with me
for years in my hands, my hair,</i>

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,367
<i>In my head...</i>

106
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,687
<i>And I can't do it any more</i>

107
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,170
<i>I can't do it any more</i>

108
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,649
<i>I should be tired of
your hands, your hair</i>

109
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,321
<i>your strange ways</i>

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,046
<i>but I want more</i>

111
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,130
<i>I want more.</i>

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,608
<i>lean? live without you.</i>

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,602
<i>There's rm way</i>

114
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,520
<i>I can? be without you.</i>

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,850
<i>No way, oh...</i>

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,809
You're gorgeous!

117
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,443
Long live the happy couple!

118
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,282
Viva!

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,400
Well done, son!

120
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,484
<i>Photo!</i>

121
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,602
And now the family!

122
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,762
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle...

123
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,320
Granddad, how are you?
How are you?

124
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,126
- Okay, so you're going...
- Are you happy?

125
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,486
Oh, yes!

126
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,408
Your hearing aid!

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,327
Can you hear me?
Granddad!

128
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,123
Are you hearing?

129
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,121
Can I have your attention, please?

130
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,080
The buses for the reception are
behind the church.

131
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,047
So, there's room for everyone,
but little by little.

132
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,403
Let's not all get there at once,
okay?

133
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,090
Okay, thanks.

134
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,770
Look at them!
You're going to look so cute!

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,490
Have you seen your brother?

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,930
Hey, kid, have you seen your brother?

137
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,527
The kid's just got married
and he's already sneaking off?

138
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,529
Unbelievable!

139
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,802
There's such a lot of people here!

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,521
Well, we're at the reception,
in this marvelous place...

141
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,409
This must have cost them a fortune!

142
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,531
Hi, beautiful.
How are you?

143
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,205
- No alcohol?
- No, it's alcohol free.

144
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,526
- No alcohol?
- No alcohol.

145
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,971
- What is it?
- Piña colada.

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,447
- Piña colada? I'll have one!
- He knows it!

147
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,164
- I'll have one!
- All right!

148
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,649
Mother and daughter!

149
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,282
Well, the mother's bit of a MILF,
isn't she?

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,206
- Granddad?
- Yes?

151
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,928
They said it was going to rain, eh?
- Yes. When I went to school...

152
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,370
That hasn't got much to do
with anything, but yeah...

153
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,244
I missed...

154
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,284
I was saying how pretty your mother
is... but you...

155
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,402
- Yeah, come on...
- It's getting better...

156
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,047
Bye.

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
Atún!

158
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,249
Cinema quality, mate!

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,566
There, there...

160
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,168
That guy's really good!

161
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,165
It has to be edited...

162
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,762
with a touch of fresco,
a touch of Renoir...

163
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,121
a pinch of cinema verité...

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,889
Yeah, yeah, right...

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,641
- Very down to earth, very online.
- Online?

166
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
Uncle... are you all right?

167
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,525
- Yes.
- Yeah?

168
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,005
Look at the lovebirds.

169
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,641
- I'm really happy, very happy.
- Me too.

170
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,569
No. What you are is really pretty.

171
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,922
- I want to tell you something.
- Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.

172
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,210
But you're so pretty...

173
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,084
I mean, you're usually pretty,
but today...?

174
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,167
Right...

175
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,166
Sorry.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,924
This morning, at my parent's house...

177
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,246
Hey!

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,367
Gorgeous!

179
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,730
Well, thanks to everyone
for being here, and...

180
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,521
I don't know... Koldo and I...

181
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,088
Koldo and I love you lots and...

182
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,643
it's great to see that you love us
so much and that you're happy

183
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,240
that we've found the loves
of our lives.

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,282
Bravo!

185
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,324
That's lovely. That's lovely.
That's lovely...

186
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,527
I want a bit!

187
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,604
Get us!

188
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,562
There... there...

189
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,764
Long live the happy couple.
We love you lots...

190
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,802
And for love!

191
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,651
Pour l'amour. Pour l'amour.

192
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,602
Rafa!
Pour l'amour.

193
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,643
Oh, oh!

194
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,361
She's stood you up!
She's stood you up!

195
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,045
She came, she came...

196
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,401
She got confused and she's gone!

197
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,330
- She got away from you!
- For la France...

198
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,364
<i>Natalié... Natalié...</i>

199
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,171
<i>A les enfants de la patríe.</i>

200
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,045
That's where I want it.

201
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,686
Hey! Gorgeous!

202
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,201
Hey, Koldito!

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,842
Okay, cinema verité.

204
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,169
Let's continue our programme
with some interviews...

205
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,211
Here we have Sponge Bob...

206
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,004
Can I interview you?

207
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,442
Yes, but could we go outside?
I want to smoke a cigarette.

208
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,085
Okay, let's go outside.

209
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,209
There's a room next to the dining room,

210
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,810
where we put on games and shows

211
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,366
so that the kids are entertained
during the banquet.

212
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,687
And how long have you been
doing this?

213
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,083
Well, weddings, for about ten years...

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,168
and children's shows, eight.

215
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,211
And what exactly
are you dressed up as?

216
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,004
As Sponge John.

217
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,884
That would be Sponge Bob?

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,970
No. Well, you see, there was
a copyright problem

219
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,401
and now the costume is called
Sponge John.

220
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,285
We are talking about a character
that's got nothing to do with

221
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,051
the one you're talking about.
I don't want any trouble later on.

222
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,242
I swear to God.

223
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,489
Well, that's it. It's really great.
Because the kids love it.

224
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,524
Fuck...
There goes the typical drunk!

225
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,284
That's my uncle!

226
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,210
- Oh, sorry kid, I didn't know.
- Uncle, are you all right?

227
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,442
Sorry, I didn't know
he was your uncle.

228
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,489
What are those doing there?

229
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,609
Once I heard
it was better to spray at night.

230
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,721
How strange!

231
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,165
Have the cops arrived?

232
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,564
Oh, Uncle, if they breathalyse you...

233
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,807
Adrián!

234
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,049
I've just filmed my uncle Pepe Victor
throwing up, man. It's great!

235
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,367
Enough of Pepe,
enough crap and smokers.

236
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,404
Come inside and start
filming the good stuff.

237
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,360
You can't rush...

238
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,727
You can't rush things.

239
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,565
You can't rush things...!
Come on, Rafa!

240
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,009
Come on, Rafa!

241
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,082
Atún!

242
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,521
Atún!

243
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,764
I've just filmed Rafa getting off
with the French woman!

244
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,405
You were made for this, kid!

245
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,885
Oh! Yeah!

246
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,643
Uncle!

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,161
Uncle!

248
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,409
What are you doing?

249
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,560
Uncle!

250
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,450
Get down!

251
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,005
Uncle!

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,206
That's dangerous!

253
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,531
Stop the music!

254
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,321
Stop the music!

255
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,441
Call an ambulance!

256
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,847
Call an ambulance!
Please move!

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,049
Call an ambulance, come on!

258
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,605
An ambulance!

259
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,970
Have you seen Clara?
Have you seen Clara?

260
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,127
No?

261
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,725
Look, Tita is there!

262
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,247
Hey, come on!

263
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,202
Follow me, Adrián!

264
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,209
This way! Koldo!

265
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,126
Get inside! And lock the door!

266
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,561
Lock the door!
It's there!

267
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,485
Ah! God!

268
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,924
Clara! Have you seen Clara?
Has anyone seen Clara?

269
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,800
No, I haven't seen her!

270
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,282
<i>Jesus!</i>

271
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,002
- What happened out there?
- I don't know...

272
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,444
People went stark raving mad and
they just started eating each other.

273
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,291
- Are you filming?
- Yes, everything.

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,684
What are you doing?

275
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,882
People have a right to
know what's going on!

276
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,490
I have to film everything!

277
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,730
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Stop! Stop!

278
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,080
- Give me the camera!
- Stop!

279
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,842
You are going to...

280
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,847
break it!

281
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,281
You know you're paying
for the camera, right?

282
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,403
Try and call Clara, okay?

283
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,969
The stairs! Let's see if there's an exit.
Come with me!

284
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,607
Come on, come on!

285
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,525
Get back, back!

286
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,642
Lock the door!

287
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,281
- Well?
- I tried. There's no cover.

288
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,686
I have to find Clara!
I have to find her!

289
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,131
That's not possible right now!

290
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,885
This is no time to act the crazy husband.
You see how fucked-up all this is.

291
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,486
Shit!

292
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,649
My name's Atún.
From Filmax films

293
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,090
Koldo.

294
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,246
And this?

295
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,409
My name's Moncho...

296
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,642
What part of Clara's family
are you from, Moncho?

297
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,728
He's not from my family.

298
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,084
SGAE Inspector.

299
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,929
What's that?

300
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,168
I make a note of the songs played
at the wedding.

301
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,964
For the royalties thing.

302
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,727
Hey, come here.
This grille must lead somewhere.

303
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,123
Ah!

304
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,642
Go!

305
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,409
Go, go!

306
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,969
Shit!
You fucking idiot, Royalties!

307
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,007
Hey, lads,
I think there's something over here!

308
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,691
Go on, go on...

309
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,691
Let me help you!

310
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm not going to fit in there.

311
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,250
We can't leave here without Atún

312
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,169
Don't be so stupid.
Go on, get in!

313
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,641
We have to go! We have to go!

314
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,283
Here. I've put it on night-vision
so you can see inside there.

315
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,402
Don't even think about erasing
anything, eh?

316
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,087
Atún, I swear to God
we'll come back for you

317
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,647
It's dark!

318
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,647
I can't see a thing!

319
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,167
Cousin?

320
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,207
Tita, here, take the camera!

321
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,207
Come on!

322
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,167
We don't know what's going on,
but everything will be all right.

323
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,931
We're going to find your sister and
we're going to get out of here, okay?

324
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,044
I promise.

325
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,366
Come on!
Come with me!

326
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,767
- Koldo!
- What's wrong?

327
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,524
When I was outside, I saw a police car.
We have to find it!

328
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,524
Come on, we have to get help,
no matter what!

329
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,047
Shit!

330
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,123
Hey! Wait!
There is a light!

331
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,049
I think... I think I there's a light.

332
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,921
Maybe this leads to the garden.
Come on!

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,002
Come on! Come on!

334
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,811
Help me, please!
Please!

335
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,849
What are you doing there?
Come on, come on, Royalties!

336
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,207
Officer!

337
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,528
No!

338
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,762
Royalties!

339
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,204
Royalties! Royalties!
Help me, for fuck's sake!

340
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,091
Come on, Royalties!

341
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,611
Hello? Please help us!
Can anyone hear me?

342
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,286
How the hell does this thing work?

343
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,371
Please, can anyone hear me?
Please... Help!

344
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,841
Come on! Come on!
They're coming!

345
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,042
Come on!

346
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,487
Come on!

347
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,647
Come on!

348
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,650
I'm sorry.

349
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,129
Get a move on!
What are you waiting for! Inside!

350
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,162
Run, Grandma. run!
Close it!

351
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,487
Shut up, wise guy.
They can't get in here.

352
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,368
Heretics! Bastards!

353
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,846
Clara!
Has anyone seen Clara?

354
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,851
Does anyone have a mobile that works?

355
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,883
None of them are working.

356
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,082
We've got to get these people
out of here!

357
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,531
We're safe in here, Grandma.

358
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,448
Why don't they come in?

359
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,131
They can't set foot in the church,
and holy water hurts them.

360
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,685
We don't know any more.

361
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,484
And I'm not your grandma, dear.

362
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,250
Is there a landline phone here?

363
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,646
There is one, but it doesn't work.

364
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,886
They seem to be going.

365
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,446
Take the kids and get to the coaches,
all of you.

366
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,164
I'm going to find Clara.

367
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,331
- Wait, Koldo. We don't know if...
- No, don't say that. Shut up, okay?

368
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,364
- Sir, remember that...
- Shut up! I don't want to hear it.

369
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,449
Koldo...

370
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,450
Clara is alive, I'm sure.

371
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,607
I know, because I can sense her.

372
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,922
What the hell is that?

373
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,165
Koldo.

374
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,609
Koldo, it's me.

375
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,561
And I know that, wherever you are,
you can hear me.

376
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,284
I want to tell you that I'm all right.

377
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,688
Father Losara and me,
we've hidden and we're okay.

378
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,404
And I know you're okay, too.

379
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,000
I know you're alive because
I can sense you, Koldo!

380
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,690
Baby!

381
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,325
I love you!

382
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,090
And, well...

383
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,650
I've been trying to talk to you
all day, but...

384
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,810
But we really haven't had much time
to ourselves.

385
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,924
And, it doesn't matter.
So I'm going to tell you like this.

386
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,448
I'm pregnant.

387
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,642
We're going to be parents, Koldo.

388
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,967
That's too much.

389
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,286
And it wasn't a shotgun wedding.

390
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,290
For anyone who's listening,
especially from my family.

391
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,880
Just so you know, we didn't get
married because of that.

392
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,968
I found out this morning, at home.

393
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,090
What's happening?

394
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,730
What's happening? Why did it stop?

395
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,490
Why did it stop? Why did it stop?
Where is she?

396
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,126
The only place with a megaphone is
Central Control.

397
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,002
They must be there.

398
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,009
But right now it's impossible
to get to them.

399
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,642
No, there must be a way.

400
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,129
There must be a way!

401
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,325
Please, help me, God.

402
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,250
St. George.

403
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,286
St. George.

404
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,244
Where is Central Control?

405
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,487
Koldo, where are you...?
Can you see him?

406
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,762
- It's too soon.
- What is?

407
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,770
Not yet.
It can't be happening!

408
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,724
- What?
- Genesis.

409
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,806
And the angels who did not keep
their dignity,

410
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,322
but abandoned their own abode...

411
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,410
The Lord kept it in darkness...

412
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,761
eternal visions...

413
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,920
where they will be punished

414
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,084
and where they will not come back

415
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,851
until Judgement Day.

416
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,403
Koldo, where are you?

417
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,729
He's here. He's here!
He's here, Father.

418
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,805
Come on, Father.

419
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,286
This is the end.

420
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,011
Come on, Father!

421
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,847
Father! Father!

422
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,961
What...?

423
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,924
I'm sorry,
we have to get out of here.

424
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,481
Let's go.

425
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,167
Come on!

426
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,324
What's that?

427
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,806
That's the...

428
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,251
...and now I'm going down
to the engine room...

429
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,566
Rafa?

430
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,164
Oh...

431
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,088
Oh, Clara.

432
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,962
What the hell are you doing here?

433
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,567
You don't know what's going on?

434
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,448
No.

435
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,410
Well, you'll never believe it...

436
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,330
That way.

437
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,411
First ﬂoor, corridor on the left.
Central Control is down there.

438
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,809
- But do you know where he is?
- No, but we're going to find him.

439
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,571
- A solution.
- What?

440
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,569
They obey orders. I've seen it.

441
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,561
They move as one. They do what
a superior, malign being tells them.

442
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,125
Where did you get all that from, Father?

443
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,926
I didn't get anything.
Look at how they behave, and you'll see.

444
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,930
They tell us in the Bible.

445
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,930
And then you wonder why everyone
thinks French girls are sluts.

446
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,929
They are bodies that...

447
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,130
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

448
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,446
Jesus...

449
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,566
It's her.
Father Albelda is right.

450
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,444
Quickly! Go!

451
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,643
Get going. Don't stop.

452
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,762
Hurry up, go on!
Come on, Clara!

453
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,929
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

454
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,444
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death,

455
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,404
I shall fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

456
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,204
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

457
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,483
Thy kindness and love will always
be with me each day of my life,

458
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,648
and I will live forever in thy house,

459
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,931
I asked the Lord to free me
three times,

460
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,520
but he answered:
"My grace is sufficient,

461
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,086
because my power will triumph
in weakness".

462
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,601
So, I will boast all the more gladly
of my weaknesses,

463
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,610
so that the power of Christ
may dwell in me.

464
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,326
I am content with insults,
hardships, persecutions,

465
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,807
and calamities
for the sake of Christ;

466
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,323
for whenever I am weak,
then I am strong.

467
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,167
Clara?

468
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,282
Clara?

469
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,324
Jesus, I can't see a thing.

470
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,645
Where are we?

471
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,331
I don't know.

472
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,321
This way.

473
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,527
<i>Jesus!</i>

474
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,801
Shit!

475
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,605
Oh Oh Oh Oh!

476
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,487
Hello?

477
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,720
Who's that?

478
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,088
Don't move!

479
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,488
It's me, the children's entertainer.
Sponge John.

480
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,961
<i>Jesus.</i>

481
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,807
You mean Bob?

482
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,207
Well, there was this thing
with the copyright, and...

483
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,928
Bob, put that down, please.

484
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,926
I took it from the guard.
I don't even know if it's loaded.

485
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,691
Don't hold that lighter too close.
This stuff catches fire easily.

486
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,846
Help me to lift this barrier up
It's really heavy.

487
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,769
And this sponge costume doesn't help.

488
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,406
Why don't you take it off?

489
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,563
Well, because I'm not wearing
anything underneath.

490
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,881
Is there a light here?

491
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,845
Yes, there's a control panel
on the wall there.

492
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,609
Clara, what is all this?

493
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,291
I don't know. I don't know.

494
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,010
We'll get out of here. Don't worry.

495
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,406
...two and three!

496
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,801
I almost decided not to come.

497
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,402
What?

498
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,209
I was thinking about not coming.

499
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,161
The truth is,
I was surprised you invited me

500
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,681
We haven't seen each other for ages.

501
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:19,404
Well, I invited you to be nice.
Because I didn't think you'd come.

502
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,170
I looked on the Internet and I found
this really cheap low-cost ticket.

503
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,885
Fuck!

504
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,051
I'm sorry.

505
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,209
Oh, no!

506
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,163
Give me the bloody shotgun!

507
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,242
I'm really sorry I invited you
to my wedding.

508
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,045
<i>Jesus!</i>

509
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,803
Natalié, Natalié.

510
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,611
Clara, please!

511
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,729
Clara! Clara!

512
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,763
This way! Come on!
This way!

513
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,280
- Come on, Clara!
- Wait for me!

514
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,322
What's wrong?

515
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,925
I think I saw something...

516
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,726
Let's go and see.

517
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,161
Come on.

518
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,289
Clara, you stay here. We're going
to see if it's safe, okay?

519
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,486
Mum?

520
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,365
Mum?

521
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,331
Mum?

522
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,241
Clara, leave her. We have to go.

523
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,481
Clara, leave her, we have to go.

524
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,731
This is my mother.

525
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,802
Clara, it's not your mother, okay?

526
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,524
Let her go, we have to leave.

527
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,890
Come on, Clara, they're coming.
Come on!

528
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,725
Come on! Run!

529
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,086
This is it!

530
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,167
Koldo!

531
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,841
Clara!

532
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,567
Come on, Clara!
Get in, quick!

533
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,841
Run!

534
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,282
Stop!

535
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,562
The exit is over there!

536
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,001
Jesus, Clara, why are you stopping.
What's wrong?

537
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,571
I'm not going without Koldo.

538
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,769
Don't be so bloody stupid!
We have to go!

539
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,882
Don't tell me what I have to do!

540
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,291
Listen, Clara...

541
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,448
if Koldo was alive...

542
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,803
he would have given us some sign
to let us know.

543
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,525
I'm sorry.

544
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,566
I'm sorry, Clara...

545
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,086
It's him.

546
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,691
It's Koldo.

547
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,045
It's a sign.

548
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,607
He's in the Lounge.

549
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,130
No, we don't know if it's him.

550
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,561
You said that if he was alive,
he'd give us a sign, didn't you?

551
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,884
Well, there it is.

552
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,009
I'm not leaving here without Koldo.

553
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,447
Move.

554
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,566
Hold my dress.

555
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,330
- What are you going to do?
- Hold my dress!

556
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,287
Wow!

557
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,283
Now, you make your own decision.

558
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,962
But I know where I'm going.

559
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,129
They've got in.

560
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,090
Atún?

561
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,930
Uncle, no, no, no!

562
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,810
Jesus, they're already here.

563
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,769
Clara, come on. Run!
We have to go!

564
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,690
No fucking way.

565
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,045
Clara, come on!

566
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,769
This is my day!

567
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,850
This is my day!

568
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,965
<i>Jesus!</i>

569
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,967
Fucking hell!

570
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,726
Oh!

571
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,921
Oh, God!

572
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,445
Rafa?

573
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,126
Rafa?

574
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,841
No!

575
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,363
Clara, Clara...

576
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,521
Jesus, this is really weird.

577
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,131
This is really weird.

578
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,683
I'm sorry, Rafa.

579
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,325
Clara...

580
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,207
Clara!

581
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,129
Clara! I'm here!
I'm here, my love!

582
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,765
I'm up here!

583
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,161
Koldo!
Koldo, my love!

584
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,051
I'm here, my love!
I'm here!

585
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,807
I knew it!

586
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,487
Come up, come up.
There's a ladder here!

587
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,006
My love...

588
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,887
I'm coming, my love...

589
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,684
I'm coming, my love!

590
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,928
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

591
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,728
I love you.

592
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,530
We're never going to separate again,
are we?

593
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,085
- No.
Never

594
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,649
And we're going to be parents.

595
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,810
We have to open this.

596
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,646
The screwdriver.

597
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,921
The screwdriver.

598
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,725
There's a screwdriver
on the Swiss Army knife.

599
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,040
It must be down there somewhere.

600
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,605
You have to find it, baby.

601
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,722
It's our only chance.
Look for it!

602
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,888
It must be there somewhere.
Look again!

603
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,165
It has to be there.

604
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,365
It has to be there.

605
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,641
I've got it!

606
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,166
Come on, bring it up!

607
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,807
Here it is!

608
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,610
They're coming, Koldo!

609
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,125
They're coming!

610
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,483
Open it, Koldo!
Open it!

611
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,684
Hurry, Koldo!

612
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,161
Koldo! Koldo!...

613
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,446
Let her go!

614
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,601
Koldo!

615
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,931
- My love...
- Hurry, Koldo!

616
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,651
My love...

617
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,965
- Are you all right?
- Yes, and you?

618
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,410
Yes.

619
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,765
- What's all this?
- I don't know.

620
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,365
And now what do we do?

621
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,682
The tunnel!
The tunnel, the tunnel!

622
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,802
We got out through there earlier.

623
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,771
You would have been
a wonderful mother.

624
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,126
I love you.

625
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,811
I love you.

626
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,446
In the beginning, God created
the heaven and the earth.

627
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,642
And the earth was
without form and void...

628
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,803
and darkness was on the face
of the deep.

629
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,327
And God divided the light
from the darkness.

630
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,325
And God called the light Day, and...

631
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,841
the darkness he called Night.

632
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,531
They're stopping-

633
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,649
And the evening and the morning
were the first day.

634
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,610
They're stopping. They're stopping.
Why are they stopping?

635
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,850
I don't know.

636
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,206
But let's go.

637
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,808
Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together unto one place,

638
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,411
and let the dry land appear:
and it was so.

639
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,649
And God called the dry land Earth;

640
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,886
and the gathering together of the
waters called he Seas...

641
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,121
Is this our family?

642
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,800
Koldo...

643
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,968
Not any more.

644
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,571
Not any more.

645
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,842
...In the midst of the waters.

646
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,244
And God said, Let there be light:
and there was light.

647
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,721
And let them be for lights
in the firmament of the heaven

648
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,041
to give light upon the earth...

649
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,686
No, no!

650
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,527
No!

651
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,246
No!

652
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,086
Sod!

653
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,083
Fuck my granddad and his stupid
bloody hearing aid!

654
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,681
The sword.

655
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,651
Pick up the sword.

656
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,644
Pick it up, Koldo...

657
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,211
Come on!

658
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,926
Do it!

659
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,726
Well done, my love.

660
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,491
You're going to be
a wonderful father.

661
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,291
Koldo, there are people over there!

662
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,488
Stay inside and do not come out!

663
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,722
Stay inside!
I repeat, do not come out!

664
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,206
Stay inside!

665
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,325
I repeat...

666
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,084
Put her on the ground!
She is infected!

667
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,326
I repeat,
put her on the ground!

668
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,164
Get away!

669
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,849
She is infected!

670
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:41,240
I repeat, move away!
Put her on the ground!
