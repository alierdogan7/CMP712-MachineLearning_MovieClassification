What's the problem, sir?

671
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:58,449
Officer, I'm Stephen Lockhart.
Just a second.
I'll explain everything.

672
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,868
Sharon?

673
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:04,246
[Woman]
Why doesn't he hurry up,
get her to the hospital?

674
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,749
Sharon?
[Dial Tone]

675
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,083
Sharon!

676
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:28,395
Sharon? Sharon?

677
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:33,609
Sharon? Jill!

678
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,489
[Sharon] Hello?
[Stephen] Sharon?

679
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,449
[Sharon] Mr. Lockhart,
what's the matter?
[Stephen] What's going on?

680
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,243
[Sharon] Nothing's going on.
[Stephen] Are you all right?
What about the phone?

681
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,537
[Sharon] What phone?
[Stephen] When we called you
from the restaurant.

682
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:50,459
Mommy?
[Sharon] When I got back
to the phone, the line was
dead.

683
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:53,670
[Sharon Continues, Indistinct]
Go back to sleep.

684
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:59,718
[Stephen] Was
anybody else here tonight?
[Sharon Responds, Indistinct]

685
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:04,264
[Stephen] Is it okay if
the police take you home? I
don't want to leave Jill alone.

686
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,266
[Sharon]
Have I done something wrong?
[Stephen] No. No.

687
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,686
Don't worry about it.

688
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:24,243
[Stephen]
Jill, I'm here.
We're both here.

689
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:27,704
We're safe now.

690
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,084
Okay. Look.

691
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:36,380
If it'll make you
feel any better...
Hmm?

692
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,935
I'll keep it
right here beside me
all night long, hmm?

693
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:56,024
You know I'm a light sleeper
and a damn good shot.

694
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,987
Satisfied?

695
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:06,118
- I'm sorry to be
putting you through all this.
- Oh, come on. Hey.

696
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:17,337
Hey, Bert.
This report just came in
on that guy, Curt Duncan.

697
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:20,465
It seems he broke
out of the nuthouse
about three weeks ago.

698
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:25,554
[Officer #2]
Oh, yeah? You gonna
put this in our report?

699
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,764
[Cardplayer]
Diamonds, Charlie.
Diamonds was led.

700
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:31,393
Yeah, yeah, I think we should put it in the report.
Maybe this gal tonight really did get a call from him.

701
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,188
Who knows?
[Cardplayer]
Your lead, Charlie.

702
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,317
What the hell you doin'?
That's a trump.

703
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:40,986
A card lead
is a card played.

704
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:45,449
Yeah. You're right.
We'd better leave this on
Ruznik's desk in the morning.

705
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,618
Sorry, fellas.
Give 'em all to me.
I've got 'em all.

706
01:26:47,785 --> 01:26:49,912
[Cardplayer]
Jesus Christ.
- I can't help that.

707
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,706
[All Muttering]

708
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:56,293
- Say, Omar, can I see this a minute?
- Yeah.

709
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,672
- You guys have a stakeout
on this house?
- Yeah.

710
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,009
Bernstein and Waller
are checking in about
every 20 minutes or so.

711
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,770
[Line Ringing]

712
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,943
[Clifford]
Hello?

713
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:08,156
Cliff, I think
I got something for you.

714
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:37,394
[Gasps]

715
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,297
[Line Beeping
Rapidly]

716
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:37,996
- Stephen? Stephen?
- Wh... Yes?

717
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:44,086
- Honey, where'd you get this?
- [Sighs]

718
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:49,091
The candy.
Where'd you get the candy?

719
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,551
[Groans]

720
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:10,821

721
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,130
[Line Beeping Rapidly]

722
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:19,014
- Operator, what does that mean?
- I'm sorry, sir.

723
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,600
That line seems
to be disconnected.

724
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:25,479
- Then why don't I get a recording?
- I don't know, sir. Maybe the number...

725
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:29,483
was just recently disconnected,
or maybe there's a temporary
malfunction in the wiring.

726
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,527
Could you try it again
in the morning?

727
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:35,322
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks.

728
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:27,123

[Sighs]

731
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:09,124
[Duncan's Voice]
You can't see me...

732
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,753
but I had to come back.

733
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:17,048
- Stephen.
- Don't you know why?

734
01:33:20,052 --> 01:33:23,847
[Hangers Rattling]

735
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:28,351
Stephen! Stephen!

736
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:31,813
- [Snarling]

737
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:34,232

738
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:39,571

739
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,162
[Continues Growling]

740

[Wailing]

746
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:46,680
Shh, shh, shh.

747
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:56,314
Your husband's okay.
