Man (over police radio):
HOUSTON, WE HAVE
A PROBLEM UP HERE.

45
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,833
Man (on radio):
IT'S HALF PAST THE HOUR,

46
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,533
AND NOW TIME FOR THE NEWS
WITH MICHAEL ST. JAMES.

47
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,067
Man:
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT?

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,933
Man #2:
I DON'T KNOW, JOE.

49
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,800
NO WEAPONS, NO MOTIVE,
NO CLOTHES.

50
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:45,767
ALL WE'VE GOT TO GO ON
IS THIS BLOODY CORPSE.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,267
- WELL, LOOK AGAIN, HARRY.
- HUH?

52
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,433
NOT BLOOD...

53
00:03:55,467 --> 00:04:00,100
Man (on radio):
DUE IN A LARGE PART TO
A MAJOR SURPLUS OF TOMATOES.

54
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,767
TOMATO JUICE.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,500
THE TOMATO CROP
CONTINUES TO GROW AT
AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE.

56
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,933
WITHIN THE LAST 12 HOURS,
WE HAVE RECEIVED

57
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,000
A NUMBER OF
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS
FROM THROUGHOUT THE NATION

58
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:15,867
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT
BE CONNECTED TO
THIS STRANGE PHENOMENON.

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,467
Man (voice echoing):
HMM.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
SURE DOESN'T TASTE LIKE
TOMATO JUICE.

61
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,700
(Gulping, gagging)

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,467
(clattering)

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
- LOOK AT THE GIANT
TOMATO, MARTHA.
- (growling)

64
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,867
I DIDN'T KNEW
THEY GREW 'EM
SO BIG, JESS.

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I WONDER WHERE
HE'S GOING.

66
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,200
(Clattering, roaring)

67
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,067
HE GOT LITTLE TIMMY.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,133
- POOR TIMMY.
- (slurping)

69
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:47,867
- HE ATE HIM ALL UP.
- (burps, gulps)

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,700
(sirens wailing)

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,233
(gunshots)

72
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,967
Man:
THE TOMATOES ARE COMING!
SHERIFF, THEY'RE COMING!

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,200
MY GOD,
DID YOU SEE THAT?
A TOMATO...

74
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,100
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

75
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,833
- THE PILOT'S STILL IN THERE.
- FORGET ABOUT THE PILOT.

76
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,933
- COME OVER HERE!
- WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM.

77
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,500
IT'S JUST TOO INCREDIBLE!
A KAMIKAZE TOMATO!

78
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,433
- TOMATOES CAN'T FLY!
- YEAH?

79
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,867
THEY CAN'T EAT PEOPLE EITHER,
BUT THEY'RE DOING ONE HECK
OF AN IMPRESSION.

80
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,733
JIM, TALK TO THAT SHERIFF
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON.

81
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,400
GET OVER HERE!
HOW BAD IS IT?

82
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,800
WELL, SIR, I DEFINITELY
DON'T THINK IT'LL FLY AGAIN.

83
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,100
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT, YOU WEINER!
WHAT ABOUT THE TOMATOES.

84
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,900
WE FOUND TWO MORE BODIES
AT THE MAIN ROAD,

85
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,800
BUT WE PUSHED THE TOMATOES
BACK TO THE NORTH END.

86
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,800
- I DON'T THINK ANY
MANAGED TO BUST LOOSE.
- THEY BETTER NOT HAVE.

87
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,767
- I WANT THIS THING CONTAINED!
- I UNDERSTAND, BUT NOTHING
SEEMS TO STOP THEM.

88
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,067
WE TRIED CHEMICALS,
BUGS, BULLETS.
NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK.

89
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,900
LOOK, THE PRESIDENT
WANTS A COMPLETE
INVESTIGATION.

90
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,400
- WE CAN'T LET THIS OUT.
PEOPLE WOULD...
- PANIC, THAT'S WHAT.

91
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,400
AND YOU KNOW WHOSE ASS
IS ON THE LINE?
YOURS, MINE,

92
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,933
- AND THE ENTIRE
AG DEPARTMENT.
- LOOK OUT!

93
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,633
WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT
WANTS AN INVESTIGATION?

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,833
HE'LL GET HIS INVESTIGATION,
BUT WE'LL KEEP IT QUIET.

95
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,167
I'VE ARRANGED FOR
THE MOST OBSCURE GENERALS,

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,900
THE MOST OBSCURE SCIENTISTS,
AND TO HEAD THE INVESTIGATION,

97
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,900
- THIS MAN.
- I DON'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

98
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,800
NOBODY DOES.
HIS NAME IS MASON DIXON.

99
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,733
HE HASN'T WORKED
SINCE THE BAY OF PIGS.

100
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,733
- IS THERE ANY SIGN
OF A PROBLEM ELSEWHERE?
- NOT YET.

101
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,900
I'VE ORDERED THE ENTIRE
G.D.P. PROGRAM SHUT DOWN.

102
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,333
WAIT A MINUTE.

103
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,667
ISN'T THAT JIM RICHARDSON,
THE PRESS SECRETARY?

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,867
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
- THE PRESIDENT'S GOT HIM
KEEPING AN EYE

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,567
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

106
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,933
- WHY HIM?
- HE'S GOT A VEGETABLE
GARDEN, THAT'S WHY.

107
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,933
WITH PEAS AND CARROTS
AND SQUASH AND TOMATOES.

108
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:02,233
THAT SHERIFF TELLS ME
THERE WERE REPORTS OF INCIDENTS
LIKE THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTY.

109
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,733
OH, BULLSHIT.
ONE NUT SPOTS
A FLYING SAUCER,

110
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,733
AND PRETTY SOON
EVERYBODY'S SHAKING HANDS
WITH LITTLE GREEN MEN.

111
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,300
GOD, WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT.
ALL WE WANTED WAS A BIGGER,
HEALTHIER TOMATO.

112
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,567
LOOK OUT!
HERE IT COMES AGAIN!

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,033
WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS ONE, GENERAL?

114
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,267
OH, I WON THAT ONE
IN A THREE-LEGGED SACK RACE

115
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,100
- LAST ARMED FORCES DAY
PICNIC.
- (snoring)

116
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,100
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
GENERAL NUMBER TWO?

117
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,600
OH, HE WAS OUT
ALL NIGHT ON MANEUVERS.
LET HIM REST.

118
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:27,700
OH, I'M SORRY
I'M LATE, GENTLEMEN.
WOULD YOU FOLLOW ME, PLEASE?

119
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,200
CERTAINLY.

120
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:33,000
OH, GENERAL, WOULD YOU
WAKE UP, PLEASE?

121
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,767
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SIZE
OF THIS ROOM, GENTLEMEN.

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,533
IT'S ALL I COULD DO
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

123
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,033
NOW, ARE WE ALL HERE?

124
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,067
- WHERE'S JIM RICHARDSON?
- THE PRESS SECRETARY?

125
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,633
YES.

126
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,500
PERHAPS WE CAN GIVE HIM
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

127
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,500
GENERAL, I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO ASK YOU,

128
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,033
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT THE NUCLEAR STRIKE FORCE

129
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,800
TACTICAL TRAINING
COMMAND MEETING?

130
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,800
- YOU MEAN OPERATION NICHEFICT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

131
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,533
NOT REALLY. I'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING THE PERSONNEL
PROFICIENCY PLANNING

132
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,667
FOR PAGO-PAGO PARATROOP
PLATOON PATROLS.

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,933
OH, OPERATION PPPPP.

134
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,633
- WHAT'S THE POOP ON PPPPP?
- MOVING WELL.

135
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,467
DID SOMEBODY
MENTION MISFITS?

136
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,467
- NO. PPPPP.
- AH.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
WELL, THEN, NICHEFICT
MUST BE PRETTY WELL
WRAPPED UP.

138
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,400
(Chattering)

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,767
GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,
MAY I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,967
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE,
I'D LIKE TO TURN THE MEETING
OVER TO DR. MORRISON.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,633
- DOCTOR?
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

142
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,000
- "MAJOR."
- PARDON ME?

143
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,133
NEVER MIND.

144
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,967
WELL, AS I'M SURE
YOU'RE WELL AWARE,

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,467
THIS TOMATO PROBLEM HAS
CAUSED CONSIDERABLE CONCERN

146
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,800
WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC
COMMUNITY.

147
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,900
SCIENTISTS THROUGHOUT
THE NATION HAVE DIRECTED
THEIR ATTENTION

148
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,167
TO THIS VERY
VEXING PROBLEM

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
WITH ONLY
LIMITED SUCCESS.

150
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,433
HOWEVER,

151
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,900
WITH THE HELP OF
DR. FUJI NOKITOFA,

152
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,633
WE BELIEVE WE'VE
MADE A BREAKTHROUGH.

153
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,067
GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT
DR. NOKITOFA.

154
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,500
HOW DO YOU DO, DOCTOR?

155
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,467
VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

156
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
DR. NOKITOFA,
WOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN

157
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,000
THE PROJECT
TO THE GENTLEMEN?

158
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,633
GENTLEMEN, WHAT WE HAVE
DEVELOPED IS, IN ESSENCE,

159
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,733
A HALF-MAN, HALF-ROBOT,
A VERY SOPHISTICATED

160
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,467
COMBINATION OF
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
AND SUPERHUMAN POWERS

161
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,533
WHICH WE ARE CONFIDENT
WILL RESULT IN THE ULTIMATE

162
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,667
DESTRUCTION OF THE ENEMY.

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,433
THANK YOU,
DR. NOKITOFA.

164
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,933
ARE THERE ANY
COMMENTS, GENTLEMEN?

165
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,967
MR. BLACK?

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,867
AS HEAD OF THE FEDERAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,

167
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,367
I CERTAINLY DON'T MEAN TO
QUESTION THE BACKGROUND

168
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,567
OF THESE FINE GENTLEMEN,

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,333
BUT FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK
THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM

170
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,900
LIES IN TRINKETS
AND GADGETS.

171
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,467
THIS IS MAN
VERSUS VEGETABLE.

172
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,633
TECHNICALLY, SIR,
TOMATOES ARE FAGS.

173
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,900
HE MEANS "FRUITS."

174
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,500
AH. FRUITS.

175
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,367
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

176
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,000
MR. DIXON,
I'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED
TO ASSIGN YOU

177
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,533
FOUR OF MY BEST AGENTS.

178
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,400
GENTLEMEN,
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I'D LIKE TO

179
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,700
INTRODUCE MR. DIXON
TO HIS OPERATIVES.

180
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,700
THAT'S FINE, MR. PLATT.
IN THE MEANTIME,

181
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,367
THE REST OF US WILL ACCOMPANY
THE DOCTORS DOWN TO VIEW
A DEMONSTRATION

182
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
OF THE LATEST
ANTI-TOMATO PROJECT.

183
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,400
WE'LL BE GOING OUTSIDE,
MR. DIXON.

184
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,700
YOU'D BETTER BRING
YOUR COAT.

185
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,633
THERE'S A LITTLE JAP
IN THE AIR.

186
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,500
HE MEANS "NIP."

187
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,400
(music over dialogue)

188
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,067
Man:
WASH, WASH, WASH.
SCRUB, SCRUB, SCRUB.

189
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,800
CAN YOU GET MY BACK?

190
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,767
- (Explosion)
- (screaming)

191
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
- OH, MY EYES!
OH, MY EYES!
- (alarm blaring)

192
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,300
WATER! WATER!

193
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,433
(Electricity crackling)

194
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,933
ACTUALLY, GENTLEMEN,
THIS PROJECT ENTAILS

195
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,633
THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIMBS
WITH SUPERHUMAN POWERS.

196
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,000
UNFORTUNATELY,

197
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,733
BUDGET LIMITATIONS
HAVE RESTRICTED OUR
DEVELOPMENT TO ONLY

198
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,700
ONE OF THESE
TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED LEGS.

199
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,767
OKAY, BRUCE,
NOW LET'S TRY
RUNNING FIRST.

200
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:32,333
UH, THAT'LL BE
FINE, BRUCE.

201
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,000
BRUCE,

202
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,300
PLEASE JUMP FOR US.

203
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,833
(Crash)

204
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,233
DESPITE SOME MINOR
RECRUITMENT DIFFICULTIES

205
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,333
CAUSED BY OUR RECENT
P.R. PROBLEM,

206
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,333
I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND
THAT YOUR UNIT

207
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:54,500
WILL MEET THE HIGHEST
OF STANDARDS.

208
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,300
PYNCHON.

209
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,400
YOUR MEN, DIXON.

210
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,367
SAM SMITH,
DISGUISE EXPERT.

211
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,967
GRETTA ATTENBAUM,
SWIMMING EXPERT.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,633
GRETTA DEFECTED TO US
AFTER THE LAST OLYMPICS.

213
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:12,333
WE FEEL SHE'S GONNA BE
QUITE AN ADDITION
TO THE DEPARTMENT.

214
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:16,400
GREG COLBURN,
UNDERWATER EXPERT.

215
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,233
THE FOURTH MEMBER
OF YOUR UNIT,
LT. FINLETTER,

216
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,633
IS WINDING UP
HIS CURRENT MISSION.

217
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,900
HE'LL CONTACT YOU
AT THESE COORDINATES.

218
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,367
EXPECT HIM
AT "10-100" HOURS.

219
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
GOOD LUCK, DIXON.

220
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,700
CAN YOU, LIKE,
BELIEVE HOW HE WAFFLES
ON EVERY ISSUE?

221
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,600
Woman #2:
OH, RIGHT ON.
WE'LL NEVER HAVE

222
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,300
ANOTHER PRESIDENT
AS BAD AS THIS ONE.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,567
(Women giggle)

224
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,233
(tomatoes gibbering)

225
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,200
- (women screaming)
- WHAT IS IT? OVER THERE!

226
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,067
NO! NO!

227
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,733
(Screaming)

228
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,467
(gibbering continues)

229
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,167
MR. DANIELS,
I REALIZE THAT
IN THE PAST,

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,133
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME QUESTIONS RAISED

231
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,267
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S
USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS

232
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,167
FOR WHAT SOME MAY CONSIDER
PERSONAL ITEMS.

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,567
HOWEVER, I CAN SAY WITHOUT
FEAR OF CONTRADICTION

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,700
THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
AND AT NO TIME

235
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,767
HAS THE CURRENT
ADMINISTRATION EXPENDED

236
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,500
ANY PUBLIC MONIES
WHATSOEVER

237
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,800
FOR THE PURCHASE OF
THE FLUFFY FLOWER-PRINT
TOILET PAPER.

238
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,567
NOW, IF THERE ARE
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS...

239
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,167
THANK YOU,
MR. PRESS SECRETARY.

240
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,567
MR. SECRETARY!
MR. SECRETARY!

241
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,400
JUST A MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN.

242
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:17,800
ONE MORE QUESTION.
THE LITTLE FELLOW
IN THE REAR.

243
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,833
BOBBY JENKS, SIR,
P.S. 149.
I HAVE A QUESTION, SIR.

244
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:25,200
CERTAINLY, YOUNG MAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

245
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,167
WE'VE HEARD NOTHING AT ALL
ABOUT THE GROWING
TOMATO MENACE.

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,533
(Reporters clamoring)

247
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,467
I...

248
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,367
UH...

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,767
WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT
A MENACE, YOUNG MAN.

250
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,533
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
ISOLATED REPORTS

251
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:48,233
ALLEGED INCIDENTS INVOLVING
SOME UNUSUAL ACTIVITY

252
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,667
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, UH,

253
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,800
PARTICULAR VEGETABLE,

254
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,100
BUT I ASSURE YOU
THAT, UH,

255
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:58,233
THIS IS NOT AND NEVER
WILL BECOME A MENACE.

256
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:01,133
HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT,
LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED,

257
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,433
HAS CALLED UPON OUR MOST
NOTED CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS
IN THIS FIELD

258
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,500
TO BEGIN A THOROUGH,
INTENSIVE, PAINSTAKING,

259
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,600
AND EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION

260
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:14,167
INTO THE BACKGROUNDS
AND ORIGINS OF THIS

261
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,600
INTERESTING QUIRK
OF NATURE.

262
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:21,133
FURTHERMORE, YOU CAN ASSURE
ALL OF YOUR YOUNG READERS THAT

263
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:24,700
THIS WILL NEVER BECOME A PROBLEM
THAT AMERICANS NEED FEAR.

264
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:32,533
THIS, UH, MEETING OF
THE SENATE INVESTIGATING
COMMITTEE'S

265
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,500
CALLED TO ORDER.

266
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,067
ANYBODY REMEMBER
WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE INVESTIGATING?

267
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,567
- THE TOMATOES, WAYNE.
- WHAT WAS IT?

268
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,433
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THOSE TOMATOES.

269
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:51,067
OH, YES, YES.
YES, OF COURSE. YES.

270
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,067
WELL, THERE'S ONE FOR YOU,

271
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
ONE FOR YOU,

272
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,133
ONE HERE FOR ME,

273
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,000
ONE FOR YOU.

274
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,667
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ONE FOR EVERYBODY.

275
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,000
WONDER WHERE
IT COULD BE.

276
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:14,033
(Phone rings)

277
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:18,333
Woman:
GOOD MORNING, CITY HERALD.
MAY I HELP YOU?

278
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,633
ROBERTS!

279
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,400
- SIR?
- GET ME GOLDSTEIN.

280
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,633
- HE'S STILL
IN BEIRUT, SIR.
- BEIRUT?

281
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,233
YES, HE'S FIRED, SIR.

282
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,100
OH. YEAH.
GET ME JOHNSON.

283
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,100
SORRY, SIR. HE'S COVERING
THAT TRIAL IN TEXAS.

284
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,067
OH, CRIPES!

285
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,200
OKAY, JUST GET ME ANYBODY
IN THE SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT DESK.

286
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,267
THEY'RE ALL ON
SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT.

287
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,133
GODDAMN IT!
WHO THE HELL IS HERE?

288
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,400
WELL, UH,
THERE'S YOU, SIR.

289
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,700
THANK YOU, JULIUS.

290
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,100
WAIT A MINUTE.

291
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,433
- THERE'S FAIRCHILD.
- WHO THE HELL IS HE?

292
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,300
"SHE." SIR.

293
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,567
LOIS FAIRCHILD,
SOCIETY SECTION.

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,867
THE NEW KID?

295
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,933
SOCIETY, HUH?

296
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,967
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
SEND HER IN.

297
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,433
NOW, DAMN IT!

298
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,300
(Motorcycle engines revving)

299
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,600
(cheering)

300
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
(groaning)

301
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,933
Man:
HEY, LOOK. IT'S A FUNKY
LITTLE TOMATO.

302
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:39,267
(Chuckles, choking groans)

303
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,467
(screaming)

304
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,267
(siren wailing)

305
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,967
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- TAKE THE OLD MISSION ROAD.

306
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,900
SOME CRAZY-ASS BIKER
HAS GOT HIMSELF MUNCHED ON
BY A HERD OF TOMATOES.

307
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,167
- SO WHAT CAN WE DO?
- WE CAN KEEP IT QUIET,
THAT'S WHAT.

308
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,167
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
THE POLICE RADIO?

309
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,567
IT'S SOLID TOMATOES
BETWEEN HERE AND HOLTVILLE.
WE'RE LIABLE TO GET KILLED!

310
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,567
WILL YOU CAN IT,
YOU LITTLE PUD-PULLER?

311
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,567
IF JOHN Q. PUBLIC FINDS OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING DOWN,

312
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,533
WE'RE BOTH
AS GOOD AS DEAD.

313
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,267
FAIRCHILD, SIR.

314
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,900
- HMM?
- FAIRCHILD.

315
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,967
YOU SENT FOR ME?

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,433
OH. YEAH, YEAH.
HAVE A SEAT.

317
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,900
FAIRCHILD,
I'VE BEEN KEEPING
MY EYE ON YOU.

318
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:25,533
YOU'VE GOT
A GOOD SENSE
OF ORGANIZATION.

319
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,067
THANK YOU, SIR.

320
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,133
- FLUID STYLE.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

321
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,533
- SHARP MIND.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

322
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,367
- A NICE ASS.
- THANK...

323
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,000
I'M ABOUT TO
GIVE YOU A CHALLENGE,

324
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,833
YOUR FIRST
BIG ASSIGNMENT,

325
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,967
AND I EXPECT YOU
TO USE

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,967
EVERY ATTRIBUTE
AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

327
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,433
I'M SURE THAT WHAT
YOU LACK IN EXPERIENCE

328
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,533
YOU'LL MORE THAN
MAKE UP FOR IN...

329
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,300
DETERMINATION.

330
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,100
NOW,

331
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,133
THIS WILL GIVE YOU
THE NECESSARY BACKGROUND

332
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,967
TO HANDLE
THE ASSIGNMENT.

333
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
GO TO IT.

334
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,233
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

335
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,800
UH, ONE MORE THING,
FAIRCHILD:

336
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,567
I'M CERTAIN
THE GOVERNMENT WILL GO
TO UNBELIEVABLE LENGTHS

337
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,500
TO ENSURE THE SECRECY
OF THIS THING.

338
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,867
GOOD LUCK.

339
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
- (Siren wailing)
- (tomatoes gibbering)

340
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,833
HELP! HELP!

341
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,133
(Gibbering)

342
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,833
DO YOU READ ME?
DO YOU READ ME?

343
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,967
GO AWAY! GO AWAY!

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,900
(Exclaiming)

345
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,100
- DO YOU READ ME?
DO YOU READ ME?
- ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

346
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,867
YOU KEPT IT SO GODDAMNED
SECRET, NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THE HELL WE ARE!

347
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,067
- DO YOU READ?
DO YOU READ?
- HELP ME! S.O.S.!

348
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,900
GIVE ME THAT,
FOR CHRIST SAKE!

349
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,300
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
TO SHUT UP! I QUIT!

350
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,167
WHAT? YOU CAN'T QUIT!
THE DEPARTMENT...

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,033
SCREW THE DEPARTMENT!
I'M GONNA DIE!

352
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,400
YOU CONCEITED
LITTLE S.O.B.,
I'M GONNA DIE TOO!

353
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,767
- GOOD! GOOD!
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD...
- (clattering)

354
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,333
NOT GOOD, MR. PRESIDENT.
NOT GOOD AT ALL.

355
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,333
FRANKLY, I WAS NOT
OVERLY IMPRESSED

356
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,867
WITH THE LEVEL
OF COMPETENCY DISPLAYED
BY THE SCIENTIFIC TEAM.

357
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,400
I HAVEN'T SEEN DIXON'S
SPECIAL FORCES UNIT YET,

358
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:13,900
BUT IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE
WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR,

359
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,167
I'D SAY WE'RE IN FOR
A BIT OF TROUBLE.

360
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,867
Man:
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, JIM.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

361
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,467
IT'S LIKE TRYING
TO STACK BIBLES

362
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,367
ON WHIPPED CREAM.

363
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,767
- YES, SIR.
- JIM, AN UNUSUAL PROBLEM

364
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,833
CALLS FOR
AN INGENIOUS SOLUTION.

365
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,467
I THINK
I'VE GOT ONE.

366
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,733
JIM, HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD OF MINDMAKER?

367
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,867
CERTAINLY, SIR.
THE ADVERTISING AGENCY
YOU USED IN YOUR CAMPAIGN.

368
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,367
THAT'S RIGHT.

369
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
YOU KNOW,
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
GET REELECTED,

370
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,867
ESPECIALLY AFTER
IT GOT OUT THAT I USED
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY

371
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,000
AS COLLATERAL
ON THAT ARAB LOAN.

372
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,400
- YES, SIR.
- BUT...

373
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:50,033
I'M SITTING HERE NOW,
AND I OWE IT ALL
TO MINDMAKER.

374
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,833
INCIDENTALLY, JIM,
YOU WERE IN THE MIDEAST
LAST SUMMER.

375
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:58,433
TELL ME, HOW DOES
THE OLD GIRL LOOK
IN THE DEAD SEA?

376
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,167
- JUST GRAND, SIR.
- GOOD.

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,433
I TELL YOU, JIM,
IF THOSE FELLOWS
COULD ELECT ME,

378
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,000
- THEY CAN DO ANYTHING.
- YES, SIR.

379
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,700
JIM, I WANT YOU TO FLY
TO NEW YORK IMMEDIATELY.

380
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,733
I WANT YOU TO SEE
TED SWANN.

381
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,367
BELIEVE ME,
THE MAN'S A GENIUS.

382
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,733
I'M ON MY WAY, SIR.

383
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,667
THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY.

384
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,233
SAY, WOULD YOU WANT
TO BUY A USED CRIB?

385
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:32,200
I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT I APPRECIATE
THIS INFORMATION.

386
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,667
THIS COULD BE
ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN...

387
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,967
FAIRCHILD, FROM THE TIMES.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,367
WHAT'S THIS DEAL
ABOUT TOMATOES?

389
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,733
- LOOK, BUDDY, DON'T TRY
AND STONEWALL ME.
- Man: HI THERE, LOIS.

390
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,133
OH. HI, CLARK.

391
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,733
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
- UH, NO COMMENT.

392
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,733
- AND WHO'S HE?
- NO COMMENT.

393
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,633
- HOW SERIOUS IS
THIS SITUATION?
- NO COMMENT.

394
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,933
- THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.
- Man: UP, UP, AND AWAY!

395
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,800
YOU CAN'T IGNORE
THE PRESS.

396
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,233
DIXON!

397
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,533
DIXON!

398
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,100
DIXON!

399
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,133
DIXON!

400
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,167
Man (on radio):
HEY, GUYS, HERE'S THE SONG
EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING FOR:

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,100
RONNY DESMOND'S
"PUBERTY LOVE."

402
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,900
Man (high voice):
* PUBERTY, PUBERTY LOVE

403
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,167
Man:
OH, WOW,
WHAT IS THAT?

404
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,367
OH, NO! DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S THE SONG.

405
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,267
PLEASE, OH!
TURN IT OFF!

406
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,033
OH, IT'S TORTURE ON THE EARS!
I CAN'T STAND THAT NOISE!

407
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,767
(All chattering)

408
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
(radio switching stations)

409
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,633
(man on radio reading news)

410
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,633
Man:
QUIET! I WANT
TO HEAR THE NEWS.

411
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,633
Man (on radio):
AND TODAY, THE PRESIDENT
CLOSED THE NATION'S

412
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,700
LAST REMAINING SUB BASE
AT GROTON, CONNECTICUT.

413
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,667
WHEN ASKED WHY HE HAD MADE
THE STARTLING DECISION,

414
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,633
THE PRESIDENT RESPONDED,
"THOSE FUNNY LITTLE
BLACK SHIPS

415
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:59,700
JUST KEEP SINKING ANYWAY."

416
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,700
AND IN OTHER NEWS TODAY,
IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,

417
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,900
A MAN WAS EATEN BY A BACON,
LETTUCE AND TOMATO SANDWICH.

418
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,733
YOU'RE FREE!

419
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,967
(Airplane passes overhead)

420
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,967
Man:
GERONIMO!

421
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,900
(Crashing thud)

422
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,800
HMM.

423
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,100
SO YOU'RE
FINLETTER, HUH?

424
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,533
I'M MASON DIXON,
AND THIS IS...

425
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:05,000
MY GOD!
IT'S ADOLF HITLER!

426
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,433
(Shouting)

427
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,533
THIS IS SAM SMITH.

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
HE'S OUR
UNDERCOVER EXPERT.

429
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:34,167
HE'S ONLY DISGUISED
AS ADOLF HITLER.

430
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,167
GUTEN MORGEN,
HERR HITLER.

431
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
- AUTOBAHN.
- SPRECHEN ZE DEUTCHE?

432
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,933
WEINER SCHNITZEL.

433
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,433
GET IN THE BACKSEAT!

434
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:50,567
WHAT ABOUT ME, MR. DIXON?
WHAT ABOUT ME?

435
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,467
YOU...

436
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,400
YOU...

437
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,700
YOU GO DISGUISE
YOURSELF

438
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,733
AS A TOMATO

439
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,067
AND INFILTRATE
THEIR CAMP.

440
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,333
YES.
THANK YOU.

441
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:45,667
- HI.
- MR. RICHARDSON
TO SEE MR. SWANN.

442
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,667
YES, SIR.
HE'S EXPECTING YOU.

443
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
I'LL LET HIM
KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

444
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,967
MR. SWANN?

445
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,933
MR. RICHARDSON
IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

446
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,933
HE'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.

447
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,467
JIMBO, BUDDY!
HOW ARE YA?
HOW YOU DOIN'?

448
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,467
- FINE. I, UH...
- SUPER, SUPER.

449
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,400
HEY, THE PRESIDENT
TELLS ME YOU HAVE
A SITUATION, JIMBO.

450
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:13,300
WELL, LET ME CLUE YOU:
YOU BOYS HAVE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

451
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:17,233
LET ME GIVE YOU A PEEK
AT MINDMAKER IN ACTION.

452
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,633
FIRST, WE HAVE TO CONVINCE
THE LITTLE HOUSEWIFE OUT THERE

453
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,067
THAT THE TOMATO WHICH
ATE THE FAMILY PET

454
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,733
IS NOT DANGEROUS,
NO PROBLEM.

455
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:30,767
THEN WE HAVE TO CONVINCE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES

456
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,633
THAT THE THOUSANDS MISSING
FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES

457
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,833
WERE MERELY STRANDED
DURING THEIR

458
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,400
BICENTENNIAL PILGRIMAGE
TO PHILADELPHIA.

459
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,967
NO PROBLEM.

460
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,333
THIRD, THE PRESIDENT
WANTS US TO DO THIS
IN SUCH A WAY

461
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:47,367
THAT IT CAN BE COVERED UP,
AND NO ONE WILL KNOW
IT EVER HAPPENED.

462
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,433
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.
BUT THEN HE WANTS US
TO DO THIS

463
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:54,633
AND CONVINCE
200 MILLION AMERICANS

464
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,500
THAT THIS DISASTER
IS ACTUALLY A BLESSING.

465
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,300
NOW, THAT'S A CHALLENGE.

466
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,400
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
MR. SWANN.

467
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,867
THE PRESIDENT IS A VERY
DEMANDING PERSON.

468
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,967
SOMETIMES HE EXPECTS
THE IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT I DON'T...

469
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,333
I NEVER SAID "IMPOSSIBLE,"
RICHARDSON.

470
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:15,500
WHAT I SAID WAS THAT
IT WAS A CHALLENGE.

471
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:19,400
MAN WAS PUT ON THIS EARTH
TO MEET CHALLENGES,
MY BOY.

472
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,333
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN DO IT?

473
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,233
CAN I DO IT?
CAN I DO IT?

474
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,500
(Maniacal laughter)

475
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,267
* SOME SELL, SOME BUY,
AND ONLY WE KNOW WHY *

476
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,500
* THE WRAP IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE PRIZE *

477
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:39,567
* IMPORTANT DECISIONS
ARE MADE EACH DAY *

478
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,500
* MUCH TOO IMPORTANT FOR
THE PLAIN FOLK TO MAKE *

479
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,200
* THEY'RE ALWAYS
IN A BIND *

480
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,800
* DEPEND ON US TO HELP
MAKE UP THEIR MIND *

481
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,433
* RED BOX, BLUE BOX,
A RED BOX AND A BLUE BOX *

482
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,267
* BRIGHT COLORS
AND A COUPON
ON THE SIDE *

483
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,700
* HARD SELL OR SOFT SELL,
IT'S ALL THE SAME *

484
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,633
* MILLIONS OF DOLLAR BILLS
ARE SPENT EVERY DAY *

485
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,467
* WHERE DO THEY ALL GO?

486
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,833
* MINDMAKER'S HERE
TO RUN THE SHOW *

487
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,267
* WE SELL CARS AND TOYS
FOR GIRLS AND BOYS *

488
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,700
* AND CHAIRS AND BEDS
AND SHRUNKEN HEADS *

489
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:16,467
* SUGAR BEETS
AND BASEBALL CLEATS
AND ICE TO ESKIMOS *

490
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,200
* LEEKS AND MINK
AND BOATS THAT SINK *

491
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,833
* NO MATTER WHAT,
WE'LL GET IT SOLD *

492
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:25,167
* WE'LL USE CATCHY JINGLES,
SNAPPY TUNES AND PRETTY GIRLS
WITH BIG BALLOONS *

493
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
* A LITTLE LIE,
A STRETCH OF TRUTH CAN
TURN THE PUBLIC'S HEAD *

494
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,767
* THERE'S TV TYPES
AND AD EXECS AND
EVERYONE'S THE BEST *

495
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,233
* AND YET

496
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,933
* THEY ALL LOOK UP

497
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:40,200
* TO A SINGLE MAN

498
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:43,633
* AND THAT ONE
SINGLE MAN *

499
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,833
* IS... ME!

500
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:48,733
(Maniacal laughter)

501
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,600
* THEY SELL, THEY BUY,
AND ONLY I KNOW WHY *

502
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:56,367
* THE HUMAN MIND IS
PUTTY IN MY HANDS *

503
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,133
* IMPORTANT DECISIONS
ARE MADE EACH DAY *

504
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,900
* MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR
THE PLAIN FOLK TO MAKE *

505
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,433
* THEY'RE ALWAYS
IN A BIND *

506
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:09,567
* DEPEND ON ME TO HELP
MAKE UP THEIR MIND *

507
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,767
* DECISION-WISE

508
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,200
* POLICY-WISE,
DEMOGRAPHICALLY SPEAKING *

509
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,167
* MINDMAKER!

510
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,833
WELL, LET'S GO MEET
THAT CHALLENGE,
YOUNG MAN.

511
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,100
I'VE ALREADY PUT
MY STAFF TO WORK,

512
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,100
SO IF YOU'D BE GOOD ENOUGH
TO STOP BY IN THE MORNING,

513
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:29,100
WE CAN TAKE A LOOK-SEE
AT SOME OF THE
PRELIMINARY SKETCHES.

514
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,100
ROLL IT.

515
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,133
Man (on recording):
THEN I CAN TELL THE PRESIDENT
YOU'LL ACCEPT THE ASSIGNMENT.

516
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:38,533
(Chuckling)
YOU BET YOUR BOOTIES.

517
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,467
TRAFFIC COPS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
MEET THIS CHALLENGE

518
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,533
DAY TO DAY.

519
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,867
THIS MAN IS LIKE
ANY OTHER POLICEMAN
ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

520
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,167
HE WORKS HARD
AND TAKES PRIDE
IN SERVING PEOPLE.

521
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,600
YES, HE'S A POLICEMAN
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER,

522
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,400
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING:
HE IS BLIND.

523
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,633
(Crashing,
tires screeching)

524
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,200
Woman:
THIS HAS BEEN
A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

525
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,833
PRODUCED FOR THE NATIONAL
HEALTH FOUNDATION.

526
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,133
(Horns honking)

527
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,300
(hammer pounding)

528
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,233
SIR, I REALLY
DON'T THINK THIS IS
A GOOD PLACE TO CAMP.

529
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:21,500
WE'RE NOT SLEEPING
ON THE SIDEWALK.

530
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,067
DO YOU SEE THAT BIG
BUILDING OVER THERE?

531
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
IT'S CALLED A HOTEL.

532
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:28,533
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO
SLEEP IN THE HOTEL.

533
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,100
NO CAMPFIRE, SIR?

534
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,200
NO CAMPFIRE.

535
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,633
WELL, THEN, WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THESE MARSHMALLOWS?

536
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,200
HERE'S THE KEY TO MY ROOM.
I'M GONNA CHECK FOR MESSAGES.
BE UP IN A MINUTE.

537
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,967
YES, SIR.

538
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,433
PARDON ME.
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MESSAGES

539
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:20,233
FOR MASON DIXON
IN ROOM 401?

540
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,033
EXCUSE ME.

541
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,633
MAY I HAVE THE KEY
TO ROOM 401?

542
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,300
I... I SEEM TO HAVE
MISPLACED MINE.

543
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,733
THANK YOU.

544
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:11,000
Man (on TV):
PRAY-TEL RECORDS
PRESENTS

545
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,700
21 GREAT DEAD BEATS.

546
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,033
YOU GET THE BEST
OF JIMI HENDRIX,
JANIS JOPLIN,

547
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:17,033
OTIS REDDING,
BUDDY HOLLY,
JIM CROCE...

548
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:20,967
(switching channels)

549
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,167
Man:
IT'S THE EVENING NEWS WITH
CHARLES COLLINGSMITH...

550
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,400
TURN THAT THING OFF,
WILL YA?

551
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,400
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.

552
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,300
MARSHMALLOW?

553
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:56,833
(Snoring)

554
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,367
OH. I'M...
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

555
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,133
I-I MEAN, I THOUGHT
THIS WAS MY...

556
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:24,900
REALLY. YOU KNOW.

557
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:26,867
Dixon:
WHAT WAS THAT?

558
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,967
- A STRUMPET, SIR.
- A WHAT?

559
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,400
A HARLOT. A TROLLOP.
A LADY OF THE EVENING.

560
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,933
GO TO SLEEP,
FINLETTER!

561
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,033
(Ringing)

562
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,233
HMM?

563
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:07,067
WH-WHAT?

564
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,200
WHERE?

565
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,133
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

566
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
- BREAKFAST, SIR.
- NO TIME!

567
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,433
- BUT... YOUR VITAMINS.
- NO TIME!

568
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:23,567
NOW, LISTEN.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

569
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,200
YOU'VE GOT TO GO DOWN
AND WARN GRETTA THAT THERE'S
TOMATO ACTIVITY IN SECTOR 2.

570
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,867
YOU GOT THAT?
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU TELL HER.

571
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,533
- YES, SIR.
- Man (on radio):
WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM

572
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,433
TO BRING YOU
A SPECIAL BULLETIN.

573
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:36,367
THE FOLLOWING IS AN NBS
HOTLINE BULLETIN

574
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,933
WITH DOUGLAS KEIKLER
IN NEW YORK.

575
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,467
NBS... THE NETWORK
THAT BRINGS YOU

576
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
THE NEWS
AS IT HAPPENS,

577
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:46,933
BRINGS YOU THESE BULLETINS
IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY,

578
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:50,533
THE NEWS YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW IT,
ON NBS,

579
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,367
THE NETWORK
OF THE NEWS.

580
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,033
THIS NBS NEWS
HOTLINE BULLETIN

581
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,733
IS BROUGHT TO YOU
BY SCHRITZ BEER.

582
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,900
YOU'RE NEVER TOO DRUNK
TO ASK FOR SCHRITZ.

583
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,767
AND BY BRIGHT GUMS,
THE TOOTHPASTE

584
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,800
FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT
TEETH OR DENTURES.

585
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,267
AND BY...

586
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,133
(chattering)

587
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,067
(rustling)

588
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,333
WHAT IS IT, SPOT?
WHAT'S IN THERE?

589
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,367
Spot:
GOSH, BILLY,
I DON'T KNOW.

590
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,367
YOU STAY THERE.
I'LL GO LOOK.

591
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,767
- SPOT? SPOT?
- (rustling)

592
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,700
(tomatoes gibbering)

593
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:08,467
- WHAT ARE THOSE
RED CIRCLES, SIR?
- MACHINE GUN EMPLACEMENTS.

594
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,467
WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE VALLEY
SURROUNDED WITH THEM.

595
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,367
I DON'T THINK
WE CAN HOLD THEM
VERY LONG, THOUGH.

596
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,967
AND THAT GREEN LINE,
THAT'S THEIR FURTHEST
POINT OF ADVANCE?

597
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,767
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- UH-HUH. WHAT ARE
THE BLUE DOTS?

598
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,900
THOSE ARE MOBIL STATIONS.

599
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:23,467
- OH.
- (vehicle approaching)

600
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,300
THAT MUST BE
MAJOR MILLS.

601
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,033
- TAKE OVER.
- YES, SIR!

602
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,967
I'M GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT, SIR.

603
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,833
- I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT WILL INTEREST YOU.
- SO I'VE BEEN TOLD.

604
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,667
DIXON, I WANT YOU
TO SEE THIS.

605
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,267
CAPTAIN?

606
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,733
YES, SIR.

607
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,700
(Gibbering)

608
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,067
SIR,

609
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,600
WE'VE CAPTURED
A GIANT TOMATO.

610
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,200
(Gibbering continues)

611
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:16,933
I'M AFRAID, GENTLEMEN,
THAT WHAT WE HAVE
HERE BEFORE US

612
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:19,767
ISN'T WHAT WE THOUGHT.

613
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,933
YOU DON'T MEAN...

614
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,267
THIS,

615
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,900
MAY GOD HELP US,

616
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,000
IS A CHERRY TOMATO.

617
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,800
- (Screaming)
- (roaring)

618
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:02,900
(rustling)

619
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,167
(gibbering, slurping)

620
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,567
(screams)

621
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,233
MR. DIXON
HAS ORDERED ME
TO INFORM YOU

622
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,633
THAT THERE'S
TOMATO ACTIVITY
IN YOUR SECTOR.

623
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:38,067
ALL RIGHT,
WHO WANTS TO BE
PAPER MONITOR?

624
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,700
I'M TELLING YOU, J.B.,
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

625
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:48,833
THE FIRST ADULT
BREAKFAST CEREAL:

626
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,933
KINKY CRISPIES.

627
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,267
COMES IN THREE
DELICIOUS FLAVORS...

628
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,067
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. SWANN.

629
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,467
I'LL CALL YOU BACK,
J.B. BYE.

630
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,800
JIMBO!
HOW'S IT GOING?

631
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,967
I BELIEVE THAT'S
MY QUESTION.

632
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,467
RIGHT. FUN-NY!
(chuckles)

633
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,233
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,
WE'VE BEEN GOING
GREAT BANANAS.

634
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:13,067
SIT DOWN, MAKE
YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

635
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,967
I ASKED MYSELF,
"WHAT DO WE NEED?

636
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,767
"SOMETHING ORIGINAL,

637
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,900
SOMETHING THAT STRIKES
AT THE VERY HEART
OF THE MATTER."

638
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:23,733
AND HERE IT IS!

639
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:26,533
MINDMAKER AT ITS BEST!

640
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,567
WHO CAN ARGUE
WITH THAT?

641
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,900
AND THERE'S MORE.
LISTEN TO THIS.

642
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:44,500
Man (on recording):
GIANT TOMATOES MEAN
BIGGER PIZZAS!

643
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:48,067
- Man #2: ROLLING ON 2.
- * IF YOU'RE FEELING
SAD AND BLUE *

644
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,033
* TOMATOES END IT
ALL FOR YOU *

645
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,533
LAST YEAR,
MORE PEOPLE WERE KILLED

646
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,833
BY AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS,
HEART ATTACKS,

647
00:42:56,867 --> 00:43:00,133
LUNG CANCER,
AND NATURAL CAUSES
COMBINED

648
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,567
THAN BY
ANY ONE TOMATO.

649
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,867
PRETTY CLASSY, HUH?

650
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,433
WITH A CAPITAL "K."

651
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,467
RIGHT.
AND MR. SECRETARY,

652
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,700
BEING A PUBLIC RELATIONS
MAN YOURSELF,

653
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:12,633
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE VALUE OF SYMBOLS.

654
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,933
WELL, WE HAVE
SPENT A GREAT DEAL
OF TIME AND EFFORT

655
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:20,533
AND OVER A MILLION DOLLARS
TO CREATE A SYMBOL
WHICH WILL WAGE THIS BATTLE,

656
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,833
AN EFFORT THAT WILL
BECOME KNOWN AS

657
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,833
THE "STOP TOMATO
PROGRAM."

658
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:28,067
I SEE.

659
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,167
IT ALL LOOKS QUITE...
EXTRAORDINARY.

660
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,767
- THANK YOU.
- NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

661
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,000
- I THINK I'LL BE
ON MY WAY.
- JUST A MOMENT.

662
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,400
ONE MORE THING
BEFORE YOU LEAVE,
MR. SECRETARY.

663
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:40,400
I'D REALLY LIKE YOU
TO SEE THIS.

664
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:43,100
IT'S SOMETHING
I'VE WORKED ON
FOR MANY YEARS,

665
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:46,767
THE CULMINATION
OF YEARS OF EFFORT:

666
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
THE WORLD'S
ULTIMATE COMMERCIAL.

667
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,033
ROLL IT.

668
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:55,500
(Dramatic music plays)

669
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,567
Man (deep voice):
HI.

670
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,967
JESUS CHRIST
FOR TECHNITRON.

671
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,733
Man (on radio):
THE NATION IS IN CHAOS.

672
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,433
CAN NOTHING STOP
THIS TOMATO ONSLAUGHT?

673
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:24,500
LAST NIGHT, TOMATOES
ATTACKED LOS ANGELES...

674
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,500
(screaming)

675
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,733
BOSTON.

676
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,033
SEATTLE.

677
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:34,267
CHICAGO.

678
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,800
EVEN THE MERE MENTION
OF THE WORD

679
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,800
IS SUFFICIENT
TO INDUCE PANIC.

680
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:48,967
TOMATO.

681
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,900
(Screaming)

682
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,300
MORE NEWS
AT THE HOUR.

683
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:07,400
NOW BACK TO THE ROCKING SOUND
OF THE BOOBER ON SUPER 101.

684
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,400
Man #2:
ALL RIGHT! MAN, THAT'S
REALLY SOMETHING, HUH?

685
00:45:09,433 --> 00:45:12,833
HEY, EVERYONE,
I'M GONNA PLAY SOMETHING...

686
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,700
(slurping, growling)

687
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:17,400
THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S NUMBER ONE
IN THE CHARTS THIS WEEK...

688
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:20,267
THE HEAVY SOUND
OF RONNY DESMOND'S
"PUBERTY LOVE."

689
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,533
* PUBERTY

690
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,533
* PUBERTY LOVE

691
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:28,367
* THERE IS NOTHING LIKE
PUBERTY LOVE *

692
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,567
(continues, indistinct)

693
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,867
WHILE THE FEDERAL
AGENCIES INVOLVED
HAVE DECLARED

694
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,600
-(snoring)
- THAT THE NECESSARY INFORMATION
HAS NOT BEEN FORWARDED

695
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:59,667
TO STATE AGENCIES
FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE
REVIEW AND APPROVAL,

696
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,433
WE CANNOT IGNORE LOCAL PLEAS
FOR INTER-GOVERNMENTAL
COOPERATION

697
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,767
- (snoring)
- IN WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY
AN AFFAIR

698
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,000
BEST SUITED FOR
INTERNATIONAL ACTIONS.

699
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,833
- (Snoring)
- THIS IS A QUESTION
BEST LEFT TO PEOPLE

700
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:14,700
FOR WHOM THERE IS
NO SPOKESMAN GREATER

701
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,233
THAN THOSE WHO SPEAK...

702
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,200
(men snoring loudly)

703
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,700
Dixon:
AND THEN I PUT
MY FOOT TO THE FLOOR,

704
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:34,600
AND I GOT OUT OF THERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.

705
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:37,900
IT WAS ALL VERY STRANGE.
I... I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

706
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:41,300
YOU MADE NO UNUSUAL
MOTIONS OF ANY KIND?

707
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,267
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

708
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,900
ODD.

709
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,800
WERE THERE ANY LOUD NOISES
OR OTHER EXTRANEOUS ACTIVITY

710
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,933
WHICH MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED
THE TOMATOES' BEHAVIOR,

711
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:52,233
SUCH AS AN AIRPLANE

712
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,700
OR ANOTHER CAR
IN THE VICINITY?

713
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:55,767
I'M ALMOST SURE
THERE WASN'T.

714
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,867
-(Snoring)
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GENTLEMEN,

715
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,233
I REALLY HAVE TO BE
GETTING BACK TO WASHINGTON.

716
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,333
THAT'S FINE.
GIVE MY REGARDS
TO THE PRESIDENT.

717
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:05,233
- I'LL DO THAT, CAPTAIN.
- IT'S "MAJOR."

718
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,167
OF COURSE.

719
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,700
PRIORITY-ONE MESSAGE
FOR MR. DIXON, SIR.

720
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,633
- A PHONE CALL FOR YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.

721
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,700
I'LL NEED ONE OF THOSE
FOR MY RECORDS TOO.

722
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,867
I'LL NEED ONE
FOR MY FILES.

723
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,867
AND DON'T FORGET
THE MAJOR.

724
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,267
(All chattering)

725
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,733
- YEAH?
- TROUBLE, SIR.

726
00:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,200
- HELLO?
- TROUBLE, SIR.

727
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:00,533
Both:
WHAT?

728
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,867
I HAVEN'T SEEN DIXON
ALL DAY.

729
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,267
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
HIS ASSISTANT, BUT THAT'S
GETTING ME NOWHERE.

730
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,433
- "FOLLOWED"? BY WHO?
- FOLLOWING WHO?

731
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:10,267
- HIS ASSISTANT.
- A SPY.

732
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,133
- A SPY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

733
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:13,333
Both:
WELL, WHAT'S
HE LOOK LIKE?

734
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:15,133
MEDIUM HEIGHT,
MEDIUM BUILD.

735
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:18,300
IT'S A "SHE," SIR.
YOU KNOW, THE STRUMPET
LAST NIGHT.

736
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,233
- THE ONE WITH THE BIG...
- GUNS AND A SWORD...

737
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,800
- WITH LONG, BLONDE...
- PARACHUTE...

738
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,600
- SUNGLASSES...
- COMBAT BOOTS...

739
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:26,167
- AND A DRESS.
- NOTHING SUSPICIOUS
ABOUT THAT.

740
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,200
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
- WHAT SHALL I DO?

741
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:32,800
LOOK, I THOUGHT I MADE IT
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

742
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:36,300
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE MADE USE
OF ALL YOUR POTENTIAL,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

743
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,400
LOOK, YOU'RE
OBVIOUSLY TIRED.

744
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:40,200
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE A NAP?

745
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:43,400
- YOU MEAN, GO TO BED?
- I COULDN'T DO THAT!

746
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:46,433
- WHY NOT? YOU'RE A WOMAN.
- I RESENT THAT.

747
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,800
I DIDN'T SAY THAT
YOU WERE INCOMPETENT.

748
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,267
I JUST THINK
YOU COULD USE A REST.

749
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,800
YES, SIR.
BUT I...

750
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:57,533
WELL, I'LL DO
MY BEST, SIR.

751
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,100
- GOODBYE.
- GOODBYE.

752
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:02,000
GOODBYE.

753
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:07,167
OPERATOR?

754
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,333
OPERATOR, I, UH...
I'VE GOTTEN
A WRONG NUMBER.

755
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:12,400
- I'D LIKE MY DIME BACK.
- (high-pitched chattering)

756
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:26,667
HI, THERE.

757
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,133
HELLO.

758
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,300
LISTEN,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

759
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:34,267
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN...

760
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,700
IT WAS A DARK NIGHT.
I MEAN,

761
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,333
THE LIGHTS WERE OFF,
AND IT GOT DARK.

762
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:43,733
I MEAN, IT WAS DARK,
AND IT WAS LIGHT EARLIER.

763
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,667
YOU WANT TO
GO TO BED?

764
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,467
UH, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?

765
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,633
- UH...
- I'VE GOT TO GO TO BED.

766
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,067
Newspaper editor's voice:
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE MADE USE
OF ALL YOUR POTENTIAL,

767
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,700
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

768
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:54,600
ALL YOUR POTENTIAL.
(echoing) POTENTIAL.
POTENTIAL. POTENTIAL.

769
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:00,933
(Clattering)

770
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,567
I, UH...

771
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
I WAS RIGHT.
I WAS RIGHT!

772
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,033
A SPY!
(screams)

773
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,967
(crash)

774
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,567
(screaming)

775
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,600
(Fairchild screaming)

776
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,200
DID YOU WARN GRETTA?

777
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:26,267
UH, YES, SIR,
BUT SHE WAS
ALREADY DEAD.

778
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,167
IT FIGURES.

779
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,900
(Slurping)

780
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:03,467
Man (over intercom):
ATTENTION. ATTENTION.

781
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,967
THE 56th COMBAT
SUPPORT GROUP

782
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,933
WILL DEPART
AT 0900 HOURS.

783
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,100
ALL 3rd DIVISION PERSONNEL
REPORT TO THE 5th DIVISION
STAGING AREA.

784
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:14,200
ALL 5th DIVISION
PERSONNEL REPORT TO

785
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,267
THE 3rd DIVISION
STAGING AREA.

786
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,067
WILL THE DRIVER
OF TANK 38421

787
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,200
PLEASE GO TO
THE PARKING LOT?

788
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:23,133
YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON.

789
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:30,933
- HAD A FEW SETBACKS
DURING THE NIGHT.
- SERIOUS?

790
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:32,467
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

791
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,967
DID YOU HAVE
ANY RELATIVES
IN WYOMING?

792
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,800
SAY AGAIN?

793
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,733
"ARKANSAS"?
ARE YOU SURE?

794
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,733
ARKANSAS.

795
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,767
Dixon:
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

796
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,400
PRIME INTELLIGENCE
TELLS US

797
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,367
THAT THE TOMATOES
ARE AMASSING FOR
A FINAL

798
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,267
ALL-OUT ATTACK
ON THE NATION.

799
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,000
OUR TOP BRASS WANTS US
TO CONCENTRATE OUR FORCES
HERE ON THE COAST.

800
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:01,500
IF WE CAN
HOLD THEM HERE,
WE CAN WIN.

801
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:04,000
- IF NOT...
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO, MAJOR?

802
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,333
YES. THE PRESIDENT WANTS
YOUR PERSONAL REPORT.

803
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:08,967
CALL HIM ON THE RED LINE
AT 1100 HOURS.

804
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,833
BE BACK HERE TONIGHT.

805
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:12,867
WE'LL NEED EVERY MAN
WE CAN GET.

806
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,100
DAMN IT, DIXON,
THIS IS WAR!

807
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:16,767
VERY GOOD, SIR.

808
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:22,767
(Gunshot)

809
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,933
SIR, I...
I THINK SOMEBODY'S
SHOOTING AT YOU.

810
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:29,033
- WHERE DO YOU THINK...
(exclaims)
- (bullet ricochets)

811
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:15,133
SO YOU CAN SEE,
MR. DIXON,

812
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,800
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO MAKE OUR STAND
OUT WEST.

813
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,833
AND I WANT YOU
TO MAKE SURE THAT
OUR MILITARY PEOPLE

814
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,900
OUT THERE IN THAT REGION
UNDERSTAND AND ARE AWARE

815
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:25,200
OF THEIR ENORMOUS
RESPONSIBILITY.

816
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:27,033
I'M SURE THEY ARE,
MR. PRESIDENT.

817
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:29,833
President:
BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU SEEN
JIM RICHARDSON OUT THERE?

818
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:32,967
Dixon:
JUST BRIEFLY.
HOW'S THE AD CAMPAIGN GOING?

819
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,767
EXCELLENT.
MY MAIL'S RUNNING

820
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,233
30 TO 1 IN FAVOR
OF THE TOMATOES.

821
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:38,933
TERRIFIC.

822
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,333
OH, GOD,
I ALMOST FORGOT.

823
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,233
- SHIRLEY?
- Woman: YES, SIR?

824
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,633
I WANT YOU TO GET
GENERAL MITCHELL
ON THE LINE.

825
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:48,267
TELL HIM TO BOMB
NEW YORK CITY.

826
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,000
BUT, MR. PRESIDENT,

827
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,733
THE TOMATOES ARE NOT EVEN
CLOSE TO NEW YORK CITY.

828
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:54,733
LISTEN, YOU WORRY
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS,

829
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:56,933
AND I'LL WORRY
ABOUT MINE.

830
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:59,500
YES, SIR.

831
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:05,833
- IS THAT THE LAST PEN?
- YES, SIR.

832
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,667
THANK GOD.

833
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,200
(Tomatoes slurping)

834
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,300
HEY, WILL SOMEBODY
PLEASE PASS THE KETCHUP?

835
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,667
(Angry gibbering)

836
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,600
(screams)

837
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,167
AS YOU WERE.

838
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,767
Man:
ORDER, ARMS.

839
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:41,700
THE MEN LOOK READY,
MAJOR.

840
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:43,567
AS READY AS THEY'LL
EVER BE, DIXON.

841
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:46,933
YOU KNOW, DIXON,

842
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:49,533
A MAN STOPS TO THINK
AT A TIME LIKE THIS

843
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,133
ABOUT HIS HOME,

844
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,833
HIS WIFE, HIS KIDS.

845
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:56,600
- YOU MARRIED, MAJOR?
- NO.

846
00:57:56,633 --> 00:57:58,633
ME EITHER.

847
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:02,567
I WONDER WHAT
THE TOMATOES ARE
THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

848
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,033
* WE STOPPED

849
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:48,600
* THE GERMANS IN '45

850
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:51,033
* THEN WE CRUSHED

851
00:58:51,067 --> 00:58:55,467
- * THE VIET CONG
- * ALMOST

852
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,100
* FOR A GREATER GLORY

853
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:02,633
* WE COULD
NEVER STRIVE *

854
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:05,500
* THIS CROP UPRISING

855
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:09,633
* WILL NOT LAST LONG

856
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:15,633
* AIN'T NO TIME
TO MAKE A FUSS *

857
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,800
* WE GOT TO GET
THOSE TOMATOES *

858
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,833
* BEFORE THEY GET US

859
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:22,767
* WE'RE GONNA BEAT 'EM,
MASH 'EM, SQUISH 'EM, BASH 'EM
IN THE STREET *

860
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,433
* WE'RE GONNA KICK 'EM,
KICK 'EM, MUSH 'EM, CRUSH 'EM
WITH OUR FEET *

861
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:31,433
* WE'RE GONNA MEET THEM,
MUNCH THEM, CRUNCH THEM,
GONNA STOMP 'EM IN PLACE *

862
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,200
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

863
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:36,933
* T-O-M-A-T

864
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:40,900
* O-E-S
TOMATOES *

865
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,500
* WE'LL SQUISH THEM,
WE'LL MASH THEM *

866
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:48,167
* WE'LL MUSH THEM
WE'LL CRUSH THEM *

867
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,933
* WE STOPPED TO NEGOTIATE
AT THE FIRST ATTACK *

868
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,467
* WE GAVE 'EM ALABAMA
BUT THEY GAVE IT RIGHT BACK *

869
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,800
* TOMATOES, TOMATOES

870
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,500
* TOMATOES

871
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,700
* THEY SAID WE'D LIVE TOGETHER
LIKE SISTER AND BROTHER *

872
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:09,600
* BUT THEY CAPTURED A CANNERY
AND BOTTLED MY MOTHER *

873
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:12,900
* NOW SHE'S AT THE STORE
AND THEY'LL SOON BE
BACK FOR MORE *

874
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:15,000
* THOSE TOMATOES

875
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,067
* TOMATOES

876
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,800
(gibbering)

877
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:14,700
(growling)

878
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,367
(groaning)

879
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,967
Male Narrator:
ACROSS THE LENGTH
AND BREADTH OF THE NATION,

880
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,967
THE TOMATOES CONTINUE
ON THEIR RAMPAGE
OF WANTON DESTRUCTION,

881
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,933
- BURNING,
- (woman screams)

882
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:45,600
- PILLAGING,
- (woman screams)

883
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:48,567
- RAPING.
- (woman screams)

884
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,733
- (coughing)
- LET'S SHOOT IT FROM
OVER THERE, HUH, BILL?

885
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:05,700
COME ON
OVER HERE, LADY.

886
01:02:05,733 --> 01:02:07,333
STAND BY OVER HERE
FOR JUST A MINUTE, HUH?

887
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:09,367
OKAY, DON'T GO AWAY.

888
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,767
WE START WITH
A TIGHT SHOT, HUH, BILL?

889
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,767
TELL ME
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

890
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,700
DON'T RUN OFF.

891
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,667
ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION,
ALMOST EVERYONE
HAS BEEN AFFECTED

892
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,367
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
BY THIS TERRIBLE
TOMATO ONSLAUGHT.

893
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,800
- MRS. WILLIAMS, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR HUSBAND IS MISSING.
- YES, HE IS.

894
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,467
- DO YOU THINK HE'S DEAD?
- WELL, I...

895
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,267
- WILL YOU MISS HIM?
WILL YOU MARRY AGAIN?
- (screaming)

896
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,933
WHAT IF HE'S LAYING
IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE

897
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,500
- WITH BOTH LEGS BROKEN,
CALLING YOUR NAME?
- (crying) STOP!

898
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:39,400
YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER MAN, YOU KNOW.
YOU'RE NO SPRING CHICKEN.

899
01:02:39,433 --> 01:02:41,300
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO,
MRS. WILLIAMS?

900
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,533
- CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUEST...
- (wailing)

901
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,500
PLEASE LOOK
INTO THE CAMERA.

902
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:48,467
Mrs. Williams (wailing):
GET AWAY FROM ME!

903
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,367
Male Narrator:
LAST NIGHT'S CRUSHING
MILITARY DEFEAT

904
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,600
MAY SPELL THE END
FOR HUMANITY.

905
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:56,667
THE SHATTERED REMNANTS
OF A ONCE-PROUD
CIVILIZATION

906
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,467
LAY SCATTERED
AMONGST CRUSHED SPIRITS
AND BROKEN BODIES.

907
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,933
LAWLESSNESS IS RAMPANT,
PANIC STALKS THE STREETS,

908
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:05,833
AND PERSONAL
GROOMING HABITS

909
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,267
HAVE REACHED
AN ALL-TIME LOW.

910
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,433
(Gibbering)

911
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,200
(gibbering continues)

912
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,300
Man (on radio):
I'LL TELL YOU NOW
WHAT'S COMING UP...

913
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,733
IT'S THE SONG THAT'S
SWEEPING THE COUNTRY,
NUMBER ONE ALL OVER,

914
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,267
FROM THE WEST COAST
TO THE EAST COAST,
EVERY COAST IN BETWEEN...

915
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,800
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'VE BEEN ASKING FOR IT,
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT.

916
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:54,367
HERE IT IS, BOYS AND GALS,
IT'S RONNY DESMOND'S
"PUBERTY LOVE"!

917
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,600
* PUBERTY
PUBERTY LOVE *

918
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:03,167
* THERE IS NOTHING LIKE
PUBERTY LOVE *

919
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,333
* IT'S SO DEEP

920
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,833
* IT'S SO COOL

921
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,800
(continues, indistinct)

922
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,033
GET OUT OF THE CAR!
HURRY UP, MOVE!

923
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,600
(Shouting)

924
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:03,600
(shouting continues)

925
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:14,733
(shouting continues)

926
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:28,400
(engine sputtering)

927
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:35,033
(engine clattering violently)

928
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,033
HEY!

929
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,633
- SIR? SIR?
- WHAT?

930
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:08,167
- SIR! SIR!
- I'M DRIVING!

931
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,000
(Exclaiming)

932
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,967
Dixon:
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE CAR!

933
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,433
WE'LL GET THEM,
FINLETTER!

934
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:22,433
- WE CAN CATCH IT, SIR!
- DON'T WORRY!

935
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,833
FREEZE!

936
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,900
Richardson:
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MR. DIXON.

937
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:20,267
HAD A PLEASANT NAP?

938
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,400
RICHARDSON.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

939
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,200
MR. DIXON,

940
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:28,033
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
YOU WOULD BE.

941
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,033
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

942
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,967
WHAT DO YOU INTEND
TO DO WITH ME?

943
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,900
MR. DIXON,
DON'T BE SO NAIVE.

944
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:38,867
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
WITH THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT CAN STOP ME.

945
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,933
DON'T BE A FOOL, RICHARDSON.
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

946
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:45,033
YOU KNOW VERY WELL
I DO.

947
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,267
YOU KNOW,

948
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,133
IT'S FUNNY, DIXON.

949
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:56,000
NO MAN SITS
CLOSER TO POWER

950
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:59,200
THAN THE PRESS SECRETARY
TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

951
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,533
AND YET
AS CLOSE AS IT IS,

952
01:09:03,567 --> 01:09:07,133
THAT POWER
IS NEVER REALLY
WITHIN YOUR GRASP.

953
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:09,567
IT DANGLES
BEFORE YOU,

954
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,933
TAUNTING, DARING,

955
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:14,933
MOCKING YOUR
VERY IMPOTENCE.

956
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,867
I WILL NOT BE
MOCKED ANYMORE!

957
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,400
I WILL NO LONGER GIVE
OTHER PEOPLE'S ANSWERS

958
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:24,133
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
QUESTIONS.

959
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:27,033
THE ANSWERS
WILL BE MINE.

960
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:30,133
THE QUESTIONS
WILL BE MINE.

961
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:33,933
EVERYTHING
WILL BE MINE.

962
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:36,867
IT'LL BE GLORIOUS,
DIXON.

963
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,567
IT'S TOO BAD YOU WON'T
BE AROUND TO SEE IT.

964
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,000
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN

965
01:09:42,033 --> 01:09:45,567
CONTROL THESE TOMATOES
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE?

966
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,067
QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS.

967
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,267
YOU MISSED
YOUR CALLING.

968
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,033
MR. DIXON, HAVE YOU
HAD LUNCH YET?

969
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,867
HERE.
HAVE A TOMATO.

970
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,367
(Chuckles)
DON'T BE AFRAID.

971
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,367
IT'S REALLY QUITE SMALL
AND QUITE HARMLESS.

972
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,300
IT'S FROM
MY GARDEN.

973
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:12,267
YOU MIGHT SAY
THAT I'M...

974
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,300
IN TUNE
WITH MY TOMATOES.

975
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,267
AT THE PROPER TIME,

976
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,867
WHEN ALL VESTIGES
OF AUTHORITY

977
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,767
HAVE DISAPPEARED,

978
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,333
I SHALL CHARGE IN
ON MY WHITE STALLION

979
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,267
AND SAVE THE NATION,

980
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,867
OR WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.

981
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,933
MY FELLOW CITIZENS WILL BE
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.

982
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,200
AT THE VERY LEAST,
THEY'LL SURELY CHOOSE

983
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:42,300
MY BENEVOLENT LEADERSHIP

984
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:45,100
OVER THE OBVIOUS
ALTERNATIVE.

985
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,800
IT SHALL BE
MY GOLDEN MOMENT.

986
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,067
BUT, MR. DIXON,

987
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,933
I'M AFRAID THESE ARE
YOUR FINAL MOMENTS.

988
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:02,400
YOU'RE AWFULLY CONFIDENT
FOR A MAN WHO HAS
FAILED TWICE.

989
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:06,067
THREE TIMES,
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

990
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,033
I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT.

991
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:11,433
YOU KNOW, DIXON,
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

992
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,833
I'VE NEVER KILLED
A MAN BEFORE.

993
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:16,933
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

994
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:18,933
(Door buzzer sounds)

995
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,500
WHO'S THERE?

996
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:25,667
Man:
U.P.S. PACKAGE FOR YOU.

997
01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:29,700
COME IN.

998
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:32,000
(Shot fires)

999
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,867
THEN AGAIN,

1000
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,733
- YOU MAY BE WRONG.
- WAIT.

1001
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,867
BEFORE YOU PULL
THAT TRIGGER,

1002
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,867
TELL ME HOW
YOU DO IT.

1003
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,567
REALLY.
