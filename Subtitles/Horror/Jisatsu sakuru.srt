Shinjuku Station Tokyo

00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,350
May 26

3
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:57,843
Tokyo-bound express
now arriving on Track 8.

4
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:03,407
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

5
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:55,165
A one... and a two...

6
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,702
...and a three!

7
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,055
Suicide Circle

8
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,560
Hi, everybody. We're Dessert.

9
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,334
Mail me. Hurry and hit the send key.
Can 't you see? I've waited patiently.

10
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:08,174
Mail me. To my phone or PC, I'm
ready to tell you that I'm standing by.

11
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:14,714
Mail me. I want to let you know as
friends go, yours is the best hello.

12
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:20,778
Mail me. I'm sure you never knew, how I
feel about you, this is real, I need to...

13
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,016
...hear from you right now or I'll die.

14
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,567
I've gotta eat. Want anything?

15
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,227
Yeah I do.

16
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,167
Is the bakery okay?

17
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,500
Sure. Get me a curry roll.

18
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,701
And a drink?

19
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,505
Get coffee.

20
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,476
Okay.

21
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,874
Thanks.

22
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,772
Darn.

23
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:36,079
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

24
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:41,925
Evening.

25
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,854
Oh, hello.

26
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,560
Hey, you won't belive the news.

27
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,257
What?

28
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:53,737
50 high school girls just threw
themselves in front of a train.

29
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,030
No way!

30
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,096
Really!

31
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,639
Studying too hard again?

32
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,012
I'm serious.

33
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:00,637
Let me out.

34
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,882
Wait, listen to this.

35
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,182
There's mass confusion
here on the the platform.

36
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,715
This is unprecedented.

37
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,824
There you go.

38
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,501
Thanks, leave it open.

39
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,368
Okay.

40
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,474
What's the scene like right now?

41
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:43,077
All lines have stopped running completely.

42
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,686
No word on their resumption.

43
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,425
Have the victims been identified?

44
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:54,489
The police are working on it,
but none have been made yet.

45
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:59,867
We first reported that it
was 50 highschool girls...

46
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,372
...who jumped the tracks.

47
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:07,946
But we've since learned it
was actually 54 students.

48
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,724
Hello?

49
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,636
Anyone there?

50
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,667
Hello?

51
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,372
Hello?

52
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,781
Ms. Kawaguchi?

53
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,614
Jiro?

54
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,151
You scared me.

55
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,857
Have you seen Akko?

56
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,154
Yes, I have.

57
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,026
She still out?

58
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,818
I guess so.

59
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,088
That's strange. The store is so close.

60
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,661
Yeah, I guess it is.

61
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,596
What's keeping her?

62
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,904
I don't know.

63
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,473
Well whatever.

64
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,445
I'll call you when she returns.

65
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,941
Thanks.

66
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,996
Ms. Kawaguchi?

67
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,692
Ms. Sawada?

68
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,729
Ms. Kawaguchi?

69
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,837
Nurse Kawaguchi?

70
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,568
Yoko Kawaguchi?

71
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,517
What an ordeal that turned out to be.

72
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,882
I think the power's out.

73
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,486
The bakery is closed so I walked all over.

74
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,684
Did Ms. Kawaguchi go home?

75
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,362
I'm beat.

76
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,323
Hey, where's Yoko?

77
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,435
I think she went home.

78
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,165
Oh.

79
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,641
You want her food.

80
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,842
Um... sure.

81
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,641
Here.

82
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,187
Ah, that feels good.

83
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,690
I'll see you later.

84
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,200
What're you doing?

85
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,929
You've still got blood on you.

86
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,100
Your shoes.

87
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:44,740
Where's Kuroda?

88
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,139
We're all here.

89
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,952
Listen up. This was not a crime.

90
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,786
It's an accident.

91
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,229
Stop looking so glum.

92
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,335
They weren't all from the
same high school, were they?

93
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,164
No, they weren't.

94
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,476
So far we know it's 18 schools.

95
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,602
The connection.

96
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,845
It wasn't a crime.

97
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,074
I'll check it out.

98
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,878
It may have been some sort of cult.

99
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,213
A suicide cult? Ridiculous.

100
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,822
Excuse me.

101
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,725
Phone call.

102
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,131
I'd say it's too much TV, "The Pied Piper."

103
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,106
Shibu here.

104
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,114
It's bothered me for a while.

105
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,585
What has?

106
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,791
You know, the suicides.

107
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,919
Yeah... go on...

108
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,554
You at a computer?

109
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,157
Yes.

110
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,269
I've got a web site for you to look at.

111
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,069
Hold on.

112
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,437
Call everyone.

113
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,148
Go ahead.

114
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:36,550
www.maru...

115
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:41,016
.... Ne. Jp

116
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,087
What is this?

117
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,960
The red dots... are women.

118
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,460
The white ones are men.

119
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,069
What's it mean?

120
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,397
I had a hunch when I first saw it...

121
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,110
...but after today, I'm sure of it.

122
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,507
There were 54 new red dots.

123
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,645
There are even more now.

124
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,819
When did you find this?

125
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,413
When did you find this?

126
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,387
Recently. It intrigued me.

127
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,030
After those 4 suicides the other day...

128
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,690
...I saw 4 more dots.

129
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,098
It's a weird site. This is all there is.

130
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,466
Check out the provider.

131
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:35,110
Tell me what you find,
okay? I'll do the same.

132
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,405
Understood.

133
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,883
And you would be?

134
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:42,950
The Bat.

135
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,183
No, I mean your real name.

136
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,625
The Bat's fine.

137
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,760
All right, "The Bat" it is.

138
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,893
Do you have a web site?

139
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:02,297
I post on a BBS a lot,
look for The Bat there.

140
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:03,469
Gotcha.

141
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:14,745
www.jikennews.com

142
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,776
Gotta go now.

143
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,145
Wait.

144
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:25,021
Oh yeah, the dots appear before
the suicides are reported.

145
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,891
Anyway, good luck.

146
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,896
Hello? Hello?

147
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,301
She hung up.

148
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,472
We've got another suicide.

149
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,443
Go talk to the witnesses.

150
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,763
Jesus!

151
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,468
May 27

152
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,870
Yeah, there was a...

153
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,298
Sports bag?

154
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,467
Yes.

155
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,847
It was found on the platform at the time.

156
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,684
Yeah, here it is.

157
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,231
Could you wait outside for a minute?

158
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,232
Why?

159
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,064
Please.

160
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,297
All right. Knock when you are finished.

161
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,505
Same thing.

162
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,476
It may not be the same
person, but it's human skin.

163
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,044
That is certain.

164
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,448
The stitches are the same size.

165
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,258
Identical work.

166
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:13,322
The skin is stitched 10 centimeters apart.

167
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,457
There's so much of it.

168
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:19,765
We're looking at an
incredible number of people.

169
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,965
You think they're different people?

170
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,142
We're not sure yet, but we think so.

171
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,674
Each piece is different skin.

172
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:37,082
It's possible that skin from the same
person is repeated somewhere...

173
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,119
...if it's like the one found yesterday.

174
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,490
So together, it's skin from
about 200 people then?

175
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,258
You could say that... yes.

176
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:01,876
There are several bodies here.
We'll pry them apart later.

177
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,608
Look here.

178
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:10,050
We won't know until tomorrow,
but we're sure it's their skin.

179
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,751
So the other 100 or so skin samples...

180
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,354
...could be from living people?

181
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:24,897
I have no idea... I'd prefer
it be from corpses, though.

182
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,464
We'd have to check a lot of
murder and accident victims.

183
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:36,277
Most have already been cremated.

184
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,947
The remaining 100 are still to come.

185
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,288
That's totally absurd, impossible.

186
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:05,836
The Tokyo-bound train
now arriving on Track 8.

187
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:11,138
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

188
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,063
See you tomorrow.

189
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,130
Good night.

190
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,617
"No end to rash of suicides!"

191
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,428
"Recent crime scene. Call
if you have information."

192
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,045
Welcome home.

193
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,651
What's with you?

194
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,359
Nothing.

195
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,855
Weirdo.

196
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,462
Toru! Sakura!

197
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,570
Come down here.

198
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,402
What now?

199
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:31,911
What?

200
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,980
Sit.

201
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,477
What is it?

202
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,484
A family meeting.

203
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,848
You're kidding.

204
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,558
What's up?

205
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,388
Indulge me.

206
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,350
Dessert's on TV.

207
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,335
"Mail me."

208
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,802
Hey, listen up.

209
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,135
What's got into you?

210
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,341
Forget it.

211
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,687
What's "Dessert"?

212
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:11,717
"Mail me."

213
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,445
May 28

214
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,908
Why do we get the garbage detail?

215
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,038
Let's just dump it on the roof.

216
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,207
This totally sucks.

217
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,225
Maybe, I'll kill myself too.

218
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,589
Really?

219
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,734
Do it with me.

220
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,565
I will if you will.

221
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,801
Question, what did you
think of the suicides?

222
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,546
Freaky, I mean 54 girls! Can you believe it?

223
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,150
Definitely a cult.

224
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,210
Yeah, but why'd they wanna die?

225
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:54,387
Hey! We're dumping this here, okay?

226
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,795
It's a cult, I say.

227
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:04,057
I heard there was so much
grease the train couldn't brake.

228
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,926
It slipped on human grease.

229
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,306
Gross!

230
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,400
Hey, let's all kill ourselves.

231
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,305
Yeah! I'm in!

232
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,277
Not me!

233
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,807
The Suicide Club.

234
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,679
Let's get enough people to beat 54.

235
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,218
100! Let's get 100!

236
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:27,186
We'll pass out flyers.
"Join our Suicide Club."

237
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,384
"Come die with us!"

238
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,894
"Let's shed blood together."

239
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:39,734
But before that, we party.
Lots of food and fornication.

240
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,239
Pervert. Then you'd leave, right?

241
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,741
Hey, you have my word.

242
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:53,311
It's gotta hurt though.
Let's not do the train thing.

243
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,218
Drug overdose?

244
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,517
I like that.

245
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,885
I could do that.

246
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,124
Hey, you guys!

247
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,257
What?

248
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,592
Come watch me kill myself.

249
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,127
Our newest member.

250
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:10,997
Watch me, okay?

251
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,598
Count me out.

252
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:27,716
Suicide club! Suicide club!

253
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,977
Jump! Jump!

254
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,578
I'm dying now.

255
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,721
Natsumi, stop.

256
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,622
Here I go.

257
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,064
You idiot! You have not intention of doing it!

258
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,989
I'll show you for real.

259
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,599
Me, too!

260
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,473
On three okay?

261
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,510
And hold hands.

262
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,441
Okay?

263
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,415
Wow, this is intense!

264
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,347
No shit.

265
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,715
One, two...

266
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,376
Wait, time out!

267
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,484
You serious?

268
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,682
Dead serious. Let's go!

269
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,990
Ready? A one and a two...

270
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,711
Oh my god...

271
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,851
Hey! Stop it!

272
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,423
We gotta do it!

273
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,765
Get away!

274
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,079
Come down from there!

275
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,252
Suicide club.

276
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:16,426
We're the Suicide Club's founding chapter.

277
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,230
I know it's hard. But if you
could, tell me what you know.

278
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,342
First, it was Machi.

279
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,207
Then Taka...

280
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,212
She said "I'm dying now."

281
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,719
I see.

282
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:51,123
I didn't think she was serious.

283
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,462
Then the others joined in.

284
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,431
Hey, Kuroda.

285
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,806
We don't seem to have
a sports bag this time.

286
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,541
No, you're right.

287
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:23,455
Hey.

288
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,525
That.

289
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,699
Scrape that off.

290
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,068
Here comes an ear.

291
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,886
We're going to have to open
a criminal investigation...

292
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,116
...starting with the train suicides.

293
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,461
We can't. These aren't criminals.

294
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,656
I don't know.

295
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,899
Something's going on...

296
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,165
You're paranoid. It's a suicide fad.

297
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,366
They're just highly impressionable kids.

298
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,370
Not a word about a Suicide Club...

299
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,078
...or kids will be dying all over Japan.

300
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,049
May 29

301
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,462
What happened? Call the police!

302
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,135
And an ambulance!

303
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:42,900
Masa?

304
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,672
Mitsuko?

305
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:45,670
Why?

306
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,503
Sorry I hit you.

307
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,978
Where'd you jump from?

308
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,980
Why'd you do it, Masa?

309
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,117
Sorry.

310
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:06,262
But what a perfect coincidence
that I hit you, huh?

311
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,762
You gonna die, Masa?

312
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,269
Yeah, I guess you are.

313
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,463
I have to keep living.

314
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,204
My ear.

315
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,779
Coffee!

316
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,163
You think she's got one too?

317
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:55,236
Do you think he meant to land on you?

318
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,339
Beats me.

319
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:02,014
Have you heard of the Suicide Club?

320
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,618
Answer me, please.

321
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,084
I don't know.

322
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,627
I don't know.

323
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:14,893
Okay.

324
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:22,169
Did you know about the wound on his back?

325
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,500
Do you have one too?

326
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:28,803
No.

327
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:34,816
Didn't you ask him why he
was missing skin there?

328
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,985
No, creep.

329
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,819
If your woman had a bent nose...

330
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,989
...would you ask her why? Boar.

331
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,912
Stay here.

332
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,295
What do you think of Masa?

333
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,757
Your boyfriend.

334
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,834
You won't find anything.
He was just the type.

335
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,003
Pisses me off.

336
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,937
Let him die.

337
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,225
Wait... hold up.

338
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:58,362
If you think of anything else,
could you call this number?

339
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,725
What was that about?

340
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:31,996
Nothing.

341
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,906
So what's the story?

342
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,739
About what?

343
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,212
Suicide Club.

344
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,804
There's no such thing.

345
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,177
I found a weird website. Wanna see it?

346
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,185
I can't hear the TV.

347
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:54,113
Such unappetizing talk.

348
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,025
"Mail me. Hurry and drop me a line."

349
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,535
Shut up!

350
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,062
How old are they?

351
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,410
Average is 14, I think.

352
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,468
12 and a half.

353
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,677
Younger than you.

354
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,677
Sakura's immature.

355
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,904
And you?

356
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:20,946
Me too.

357
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,585
I like the song actually.

358
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,777
500 million.

359
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,352
Don't blame me.

360
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,225
Kiyoko, your dad's tired.

361
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,305
Kiyoko, it's not my fault, you know.

362
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:24,076
Good evening. I am The Bat.

363
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,178
I've made it this far.

364
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,849
I believe the source of
all the recent suicides...

365
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,354
...lies somewhere on the Net.

366
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,854
I've come here to find out if I'm right.

367
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:44,992
I understand the meaning of the dots.

368
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,397
So have I got it all right.

369
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,007
It wasn't easy you know.

370
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,769
If so, please respond. I'll be waiting.

371
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,905
With love...

372
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:04,886
To my dear Suicide Club.

373
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,923
Watch this.

374
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,723
Ruins. Com.

375
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,161
Yeah, weird, huh?

376
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:20,427
"Spread this message if you
want to halt the suicides"

377
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,371
"Or more will die. We will all die."

378
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,435
A friend showed it to me.

379
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,711
Is there more?

380
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,547
Nope, that's it.

381
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,682
Gotta be a prank.

382
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,311
Inspection done.

383
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,631
Yes, I'm in!

384
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,296
Dad! Dad! Dad!

385
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,729
Dad, do we dare?

386
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,531
Don't be silly. Move over.

387
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,239
What is it?

388
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,582
"Kuroda"

389
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,446
What are you typing?

390
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,351
Now we wait for a response.

391
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,765
Yeah, hello?

392
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:21,237
Is Mr. Kuroda there?

393
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,975
Kuroda? He's gone home.

394
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,882
He left early today. Can I help you?

395
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:35,322
You are?

396
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,650
You okay?

397
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,753
Who are you?

398
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,125
I'm Murata.

399
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,368
When will Kuroda be in?

400
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:54,675
Tomorrow morning. Who might you be?

401
00:46:55,946 --> 00:47:01,509
There is no Suicide
Club. Just tell him that.

402
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,480
I'll call tomorrow at 8.

403
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,473
Hello? Kuroda?

404
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,678
We're ready.

405
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,511
May 30

406
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,521
You're on.

407
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:45,817
Hello?

408
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,295
Is this Mr. Kuroda?

409
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,268
This is Kuroda. And you are?

410
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,895
You taping this?

411
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,863
Yes.

412
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,674
Will it be on TV?

413
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,874
That depends on whether you help us.

414
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,116
Are you with a friend?

415
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,582
There are others, yes.

416
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,559
I see. These "others" are they big people?

417
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,229
What do you mean?

418
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,266
Are they adults?

419
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,335
No.

420
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,273
Then I can't promise any TV.

421
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,540
Why not?

422
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,140
Because you're not involved.

423
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,079
Are you involved in yourself?

424
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,076
What? Say again?

425
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,251
I guess you don't understand.

426
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,284
Are you involved?

427
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,257
With what?

428
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,196
The suicides.

429
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:03,700
You obviously have no idea.

430
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:11,341
Tonight at 7:30, on the same platform...

431
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,884
...50 more will jump.

432
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:21,784
Could be girls, could be kids.

433
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,985
Here's a hint, the 6th chain.

434
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,102
It's a prank.

435
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,400
Do we stake it out?

436
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:43,468
What do you propose we
watch? All males? All females?

437
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,515
The 6th chain...

438
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,329
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6

439
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:12,333
This is no accident, got it?

440
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:14,940
It's a crime.

441
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,823
Ome-bound train now arriving.

442
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,833
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

443
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,708
You girls on your way home?

444
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,643
Yes.

445
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,274
Straight home?

446
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,431
Going home?

447
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,729
Yes, I am.

448
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:33,856
Kuroda!

449
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,564
Excuse me. Show me your tattoo.

450
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:43,997
Fuck off.

451
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,168
You got one?

452
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,296
She doesn't, I've seen her naked.

453
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,407
Shut up. Is this a pick up line?

454
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,855
Hey, is that a real tattoo?

455
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,869
You guys have tattoos? No?

456
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:26,403
Thanks.

457
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,286
You're sloshed, man.

458
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:27,967
Shibu!

459
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,139
Stop right there!

460
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,921
Police!

461
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,108
Nothing doing.

462
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,114
Wait one more train.

463
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,345
Right.

464
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,590
Those cheap tattoos?

465
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,355
Everyone's got 'em these days.

466
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:11,207
Takao-bound express now
arriving on Track 10.

467
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:16,703
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

468
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,371
One and two...

469
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,813
One and two and three...

470
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:42,227
Please stand clear of the doors.

471
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,287
That's enough. We're done.

472
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,251
Look, more.

473
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,557
Don't leave to tomorrow
what you can do today.

474
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,793
Japan's too complacent.

475
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,163
I used to shoplift.

476
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,703
We're sinners.

477
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:53,867
Yes, life is a sin! You just
cause trouble for others.

478
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,943
Kill yourself before you murder someone.

479
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,649
That's the spirit.

480
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:00,741
Be a spirit.

481
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,858
You order that again?

482
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:16,361
Do me a favor. Try something
new for a change, will ya?

483
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,599
This is gonna be heavenly.

484
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,263
Delectable.

485
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:25,802
What is that?

486
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,169
I dunno. Something hot.

487
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,287
Evening folks.

488
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:46,196
Have you noticed how quickly
fads come and go these days?

489
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,527
I have.

490
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,196
Take cell phones...

491
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,233
"Jump here"

492
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,052
Yum, chocolate. All for me.

493
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:21,524
Hey, not so fast! Give us some!

494
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,596
We've got our own chocolate bar.

495
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,298
What? You want some?

496
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,501
Okay, go ask your mother.

497
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,971
Mom!

498
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,245
It's rising.

499
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,653
Ropes, ladies.

500
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,458
To the great beyond.

501
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,297
Mom, can I get some chocolate?

502
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:06,106
Sure, if you're a good girl.

503
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:16,408
Come here. Dessert's on TV.

504
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,548
Mom's funny.

505
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,738
You hallucinate.

506
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,170
Go kill yourself.

507
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,477
Thank you very much.

508
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,185
If a gentle melody rises to your ears...

509
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,759
...stop the world revolving
and let music swell.

510
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:05,457
Someday we shall meet again,
so wipe away those tears.

511
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:09,531
Now it's time to bid you
all a pleasant farewell.

512
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,266
Now it's time to bid you
all a pleasant farewell.

513
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:24,179
Now it's time to say goodbye.
I hope you all are well.

514
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,217
Everyone's acting funny these days.

515
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,594
We want this song to cheer everybody up.

516
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,688
I'm home.

517
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,498
Welcome home, dad!

518
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,200
I'm exhausted.

519
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:45,367
Kiyomi! Toru!

520
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:58,848
"Track 8: Jump here."

521
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:02,750
Sakura? Sakura!

522
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,752
"Look behind you!"

523
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,813
Metropolitan Police Department

524
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:51,232
So you thought this was
all a game, eh, Bat Girl?

525
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,427
Reality's a lot simpler.

526
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,661
You lose.

527
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,364
Now type.

528
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,531
Shut the fuck up.

529
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,370
What do you want?

530
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:09,316
Mail the cops. Tell them
you were kidnapped...

531
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,746
...by the Suicide Club. You can type blind.

532
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,758
"Help me!"

533
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,788
Genesis, we're back.

534
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,010
Welcome to the Suicide Club.

535
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:34,668
You're guests of my pleasure room.

536
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:40,568
Now Kiyoko, your glasses are crooked.

537
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,083
Better? Can you see clearly now?

538
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:03,731
Bad boy! Bad, bad boy!

539
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,963
Sissy.

540
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,674
My chair!

541
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:27,122
Hammer.

542
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,594
Son of a bitch.

543
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:43,599
Kiyoko, what do you do in your
free time? You like home repair?

544
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,379
I asked you a question!

545
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,138
There.

546
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:00,113
Welcome to my pleasure room.

547
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,721
Let's entertain them.

548
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,457
Shut up and listen!

549
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:44,156
Time and time again the sky is blue.

550
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:51,763
And yet it's strange how people
seem to always fall in love.

551
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:57,378
An unfamiliar yellow dog...

552
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:05,785
...keeps grinning as it tears
us from the ones we love.

553
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,753
Because the dead...

554
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,886
Because the dead...

555
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:20,095
Because the dead shine all night long.

556
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:28,976
I want to die as beautifully
as Joan of Arc...

557
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:34,176
...inside a Bresson film.

558
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:41,254
Lesson one, apply the shaving cream...

559
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:48,024
...and smile as you then
slowly slice away the heart.

560
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,229
Because the dead...

561
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,430
Because the dead...

562
01:07:56,972 --> 01:08:03,036
Because the dead shine all night long.

563
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:12,020
Feel the warmth of the spring rain as
it gently moistens down a cheek...

564
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:17,754
...that's streaked with dried up tears.

565
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:25,523
A guileless boy but five years old
stares blankly in the face of death...

566
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:32,164
...while his heart is cut and torn away.

567
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,232
Kuroda...

568
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:40,433
The tattoo of the 6th chain.

569
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:54,888
This isn't suicide. It's murder.

570
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,697
Tell me. Which is murder, and which isn't?

571
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:20,704
Is it murder starting today?
Or is this a special exception?

572
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,886
It was murder from the start!

573
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,083
It was.

574
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,184
All of it.

575
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,620
I'm so sorry.

576
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:43,296
It's my fault. I was blind.

577
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:53,946
Hello?

578
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:56,448
Yes, okay.

579
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,385
It's for you.

580
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:02,756
Who is it?

581
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,093
I think it's your son.

582
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:18,004
Hello, Mr. Kuroda?

583
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,110
Give it to him.

584
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:42,755
Kuroda here.

585
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,399
Kuroda, hold on.

586
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,102
Hello?

587
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,338
Why'd you do it?

588
01:11:57,946 --> 01:11:59,004
I didn't.

589
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:02,716
Why?

590
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,383
What's your connection to you?

591
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,587
What?

592
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,218
Good bye.

593
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:15,890
Wait!

594
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:25,630
Do you understand? I
understand our connection.

595
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:31,573
I understand your connection to your wife.

596
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:37,248
I understand your
connection to your children.

597
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,421
But as for your connection to yourself...

598
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:48,860
If you die, will you lose the
connection with yourself?

599
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:57,236
Even if you die, your connection
with your wife will remain.

600
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:02,971
So will your connection with your children.

601
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,876
But if you die, will you lose
your connection with yourself?

602
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:18,654
Will you live on? Are you
connected to yourself?

603
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:32,768
Why couldn't you feel the pain
of others as you would your own?

604
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:39,713
Why couldn't you bear the pain
of others as you would your own?

605
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,207
You are the criminal.

606
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,988
You could only think of
yourself. You're scum.

607
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,588
Scum!

608
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,259
Kuroda!

609
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,806
Investigate all suicides up until now.

610
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,939
That's an order!

611
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:10,870
Kuroda!

612
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:23,817
It's no use.

613
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:26,852
It's no use.

614
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,831
They're not the enemy.

615
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:33,595
Kuroda!

616
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,236
This is crazy.

617
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,005
Really crazy.

618
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,038
What does it mean?

619
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:52,946
Overtime.

620
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:03,626
Shibu!

621
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:05,692
What is it?

622
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,396
Get the providers and all links.

623
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,510
You leaving school man?

624
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,240
I blew my finals, so yeah.

625
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:19,604
Finish high school at least.

626
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,884
Why? You didn't.

627
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:22,407
True.

628
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,723
I'm starving.

629
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,587
I could go for some red meat.

630
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,956
After a kill, make it rare.

631
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:43,131
"It's the Bat. Get me out of here!"

632
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:43,654
Memo.

633
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:45,730
Here.

634
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:52,662
Let's go.

635
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,610
What are you doing?

636
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,288
Move aside.

637
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,890
Go ahead, Kiyoko. Type away.

638
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:24,364
"From what I can tell, I'm in a
dimly-lit basement of some kind."

639
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:30,471
That won't do. Tell them our address.

640
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:38,110
Go ahead. We need to stir
up some excitement anyway.

641
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:43,657
Now's the perfect time to
get caught. Right? Right?

642
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:48,092
This is where my name
gets etched in history.

643
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,962
Here, let me do that.

644
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,893
Entertain her, will you?

645
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:02,639
Hi, there. My name's Genesis.

646
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:10,686
I've had delusions of
grandeur since I was a child.

647
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,348
May 31

648
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,852
Just after 7 this morning...

649
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:20,124
...the police arrested a group
calling itself The Suicide Club...

650
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:24,995
...and claiming responsibility
for multiple murders.

651
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:30,534
The group used the Internet to
call upon people to kill themselves.

652
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:34,541
Their proclaimed aim was social upheaval.

653
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:38,303
Investigators are now working
to uncover the details.

654
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:43,609
Stand back please, move aside.

655
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:47,817
Am I on camera? Good, good, good.

656
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,523
First I'd like to say reality
is invisible to the naked eye.

657
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:57,621
You and me both know
that life is a real bitch.

658
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:02,702
Bring your best you say?
That's not good enough.

659
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:07,535
It's like that Dessert
song. How's that go again?

660
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:13,003
"The world is a jigsaw puzzle."

661
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:16,140
Somewhere there's a fit for you.

662
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,821
Has to fit.

663
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:50,351
The world is a jigsaw puzzle.

664
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:56,253
The world is a jigsaw puzzle.

665
01:19:56,658 --> 01:20:00,822
Somewhere there 's a fit for you.

666
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:08,132
A place where your puzzle piece belongs.

667
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:13,063
Don 't fit you say? Then make it so.

668
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,969
There 's nowhere for my piece to go.

669
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:23,107
Find a match that lasts forever.

670
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:28,914
Perhaps I better say so long.

671
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,827
I'm the Charlie Manson
of the Information Age!

672
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:47,141
"Find a match that lasts forever."

673
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:53,074
"Perhaps I'd better say so long."

674
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,285
It's open.

675
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,293
Mitsuko.

676
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,431
I've come to return this.

677
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,750
June 1

678
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,078
Mail me...

679
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,951
No. 8, two fingers.

680
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,885
No. 4, three fingers.

681
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,554
No. 2, three fingers.

682
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,894
No. 4, three fingers.

683
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:40,438
No. 3, one finger.

684
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,375
No. 3, two fingers.

685
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:47,548
Suicide.

686
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,890
Please enter your PIN number.

687
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,473
Got it?

688
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:16,936
Who is this?

689
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:21,975
There is no Suicide Club you know.

690
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,009
But come on over.

691
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,120
Hello.

692
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:10,828
Hey Shibu...

693
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:15,594
...just got word that 200 girls
jumped from Osaka Castle.

694
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,772
I wonder if we got the right guy.

695
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:23,637
How did he get them to do it?

696
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,966
"Dessert concert tomorrow."

697
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,669
June 2

698
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,319
Even if you were to die...

699
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:23,794
...your connection to your
boyfriend would remain.

700
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:30,428
Even if you were to die, your
link to the world would remain.

701
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:33,668
So why are you living?

702
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:43,435
Why did you come?

703
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:48,478
Did you come to repair your
connection with yourself?

704
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:52,377
Or did you come to sever that connection?

705
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,121
Are you now severed from yourself?

706
01:29:57,425 --> 01:30:00,622
I am I. And I'm connected to myself.

707
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:10,835
Are you related to you?

708
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:16,542
Like between you and me,
victim and assailant...

709
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:23,510
...you and your boyfriend.
Can you relate to yourself?

710
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:27,081
Are you related to yourself?

711
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,787
Are you sought by yourself?

712
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,389
When rain dries, clouds form.

713
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:37,186
When rain dries, clouds form.

714
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:40,997
When clouds moisten, rain forms.

715
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:10,357
It's ready.

716
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:49,251
Tokyo-bound express
now arriving on Track 8.

717
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:54,690
For your safety, please
stay behind the yellow line.

718
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:19,340
This is Dessert's final performance.
Thanks for all your support.

719
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:23,183
Our last message to you is...

720
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:26,347
Live as you please!

721
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:39,730
Little did we know how
little do we really know.

722
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:44,661
Everyday we 're pressing the keys...

723
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:53,480
...that execute a million commands.

724
01:35:53,814 --> 01:36:00,617
If only you would say exactly
what is on your mind...

725
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:06,357
...and tell me how you really feel.

726
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:13,757
Maybe I can lend a helping hand.

727
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:22,875
Scary it's true, but loads of fun too.

728
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:28,173
To open up and feel the brand of life...

729
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:35,584
...for each and everyone.

730
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:41,223
Light yourself with life.

731
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:46,526
Light yourself with love.

732
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:51,628
Light yourself with memories.

733
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:59,507
All it takes is just a little
heart and courage on your part.

734
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:15,255
Turn yourself around and take
it once again from the start.

735
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:20,256
Though you may feel out
of touch at times...

736
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:29,538
...or fear a wicked spell
has got your life in hand.

737
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:36,709
If by some chance, you share the
feelings that I have for you...

738
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:42,219
...come occupy the chasm of my heart.

739
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:50,629
Together we can shed light on the dark.

740
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:58,667
Scary, it's true. But we 'll be happy too.

741
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:03,736
