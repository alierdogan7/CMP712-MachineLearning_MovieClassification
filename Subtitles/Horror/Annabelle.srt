MIA:
Oh. It's beautiful. Thank you, Father.

1043
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,898
The loveliest masterpiece
of the heart of God...

1044
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,988
...is the love of a mother.

1045
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,700
Thank you.

1046
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,853
WOMAN 1:
Anything I can help you with?

1047
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:32,274
WOMAN 2: Oh, I'm just trying to find
something for my daughter. Thanks.

1048
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,284
She's a nurse.

1049
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,615
Always helping people.

1050
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,658
We looked everywhere for one of these.

1051
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,826
Never did find one.

1052
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,378
WOMAN 1:
It's a collector's item, supposedly.

1053
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,211
That's why we price it
a little higher than the rest.

1054
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,798
- You want me to ring it up?
WOMAN 2: Yes, please.
