So, this is just

Tie one on both ends,

59
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,592
then you tighten
one side to a branch.

60
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,761
Now, you see how
the ground here

61
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,864
is sort of like a funnel shape?

62
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,468
- It's a trail?
- That's right.

63
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,004
That's where you want
to set the noose.

64
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,105
So you hide it with leaves.

65
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,237
Then you put sticks
all around it

66
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,839

have to run this way

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Come on, get up!

184
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:42,657
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

185
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,392
- ( groaning )
- Shh. ( laughing )

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,461
- ( laughing continues )
- ( belt buckle clinks )

187
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:51,800
- Get away from him before I--
- Huh? Right over here.

188
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,970
What the hell are you
gonna do now, sport?

189
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:56,939
( screams )

190
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:59,411
( gurgling )

191
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:13,695
( gunshot )

192
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,767
I'll kill him.
I'll-- I'll kill him!

193
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:20,901
Let the boy go.

194
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,470
( grunts )

195
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,043
( gurgling )

196
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,047
He's mine.

197
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:34,015
Stay back.
Stay--

198
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,714
Please--

199
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:40,353
( screaming )

200
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:51,228
<i>( stabbing continues )</i>

201
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,874
<i>( stabbing continues )</i>

202
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:08,857
Hershel: <i>Here.</i>

203
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,817
What is?

204
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,319
Those feral pigs in the forest,

205
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:19,889
it doesn't take much
to domesticate them.

206
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:22,392
Same with the horses
we've seen.

207
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,733
We have seeds. We can
grow our own food.

208
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:27,969
It's time we started planting.

209
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,305
Okay.

210
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,246
Can't do it myself.

211
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,051
I got to go out there.

212
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,650
Go on runs, be at the fences.

213
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,489
I teach you how to do this.

214
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:46,691
You teach Carl.

215
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,926
We're going to be here a while.

216
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,830
They need me.

217
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,832
We've been here two months.

218
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:56,133
You've made it work.

219
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:57,769
The war is over, Rick.

220
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,940
No, we don't know that.

221
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,542
I'm talking about you.

222
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,915
I'm saying it,
and I'm saying this,

223
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:09,350
you pull Carl back
from going out there, fine.

224
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,288
- He shot that boy.
- Yeah, I know.

225
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,990
He needs his father.

226
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:18,059
He needs his father
to show him the way.

227
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,195
What way are you
going to show him?

228
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:24,234
He can shoot, we know that.

229
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:27,103
What's his life going to be?

230
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,536
What's yours?

231
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,275
All this.

232
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:40,681
I'm just saying everything

233
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,316
because I owe you.

234
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,684
We all owe you.

235
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,885
We can make this better now.

236
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,119
Things changing in here

237
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,521
doesn't change
things out there.

238
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,824
No, it doesn't.

239
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:01,759
But we're here today,
right now.

240
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,658
This is a good place to start.

241
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,995
( motor starts )

242
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:10,432
There's a run soon.

243
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:13,068
- I got to go.
- No, you don't.

244
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,976
We should save it to drink.

245
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:19,816
You can't see yourself, he can.

246
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,557
I didn't know what they were.

247
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,497
How'd you wind up with them?

248
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:40,165
I was with Beth.

249
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,902
We got out together.

250
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,375
I was with her for a while.

251
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:55,152
Is she dead?

252
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,657
She's just gone.

253
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,370
<i>After that,</i>

254
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,505
<i>that's when they found me.</i>

255
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,408
I mean, I knew they were bad,

256
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,410
but they had a code.

257
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,349
It was simple.

258
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:21,922
Stupid, but it was something.

259
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:23,422
It was enough.

260
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,556
And you were alone.

261
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,729
They said they were looking
for some guy.

262
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,403
Last night they said
they spotted him.

263
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:38,572
I was hanging back.
I was gonna leave.

264
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,840
But I stayed.

265
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:46,447
That's when I saw
it was you three.

266
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:50,215
Right when you saw me.

267
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:57,723
I didn't know
what they could do.

268
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:05,330
It's not on you, Daryl.

269
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,799
Hey.

270
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,467
It's not on you.

271
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:17,306
You being back
with us here, now,

272
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,240
that's everything.

273
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,083
You're my brother.

274
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:45,331
Hey, what you did last night...

275
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:49,468
anybody would have done that.

276
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,004
No, not that.

277
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:02,450
Something happened.

278
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:03,952
That ain't you.

279
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:07,388
Daryl, you saw
what I did to Tyreese.

280
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,623
<i>It ain't all of it,</i>
<i>but that's me.</i>

281
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,460
<i>That's why I'm here now.</i>

282
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:15,131
<i>That's why Carl is.</i>

283
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,299
<i>I want to keep him safe.</i>

284
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:21,802
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

285
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:40,124
You okay?

286
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,027
Yeah.

287
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:49,539
I'm okay.

288
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,310
I know.

289
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,981
How?

290
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,352
'Cause I'm okay, too.

291
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,867
We're getting close.

292
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,868
Be there before sundown.

293
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,369
Now we head through the woods.

294
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:22,273
We don't know who they are.

295
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,641
All right.

296
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:57,249
We all spread out,

297
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,984
watch for a while,
see what we see,

298
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:02,887
and get ready.

299
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,755
We all stay close.

300
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,159
You want to stick with me?

301
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:10,595
It's all right.

302
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:22,073
Why didn't you go
with your dad?

303
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:34,388
When I told you about Andre,

304
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,094
you never asked how he died.

305
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,097
I knew why.

306
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:42,430
Yeah, but the how is important.

307
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,836
We went to a refugee camp.

308
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:50,576
Andre and my boyfriend Mike,

309
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:52,712
that was Andre's father,

310
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:55,045
and our friend Terry.

311
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,849
At the camp,

312
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,953
it just got worse and worse.

313
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:01,756
People were leaving.

314
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:03,258
People giving up.

315
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,427
But I didn't.

316
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,300
<i>I was coming back from a run.</i>

317
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:15,805
I saw the fences were down.

318
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:20,110
I heard the moans.

319
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,648
It was over.

320
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,351
And Mike and Terry,

321
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:28,420
they were high
when it happened.

322
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:33,091
They were bit.

323
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,593
Could have stopped it.

324
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:39,730
Could have killed them.

325
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,901
But I let them turn.

326
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,940
I made it
so they couldn't bite,

327
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:50,043
couldn't scratch.

328
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,913
I tied chains
around their necks.

329
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:54,748
It was insane.

330
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,516
It was sick.

331
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,420
It felt like what I deserved,

332
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:04,654
dragging them around
so that I would always know.

333
00:25:04,656 --> 00:25:07,459
I found out that
they kept me safe.

334
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,194
They hid me.

335
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:16,866
The walkers didn't
see me anymore.

336
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,768
I was just another monster.

337
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,968
And I was.

338
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,071
Me.

339
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:28,604
I was gone for a long time.

340
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,878
But then Andrea
brought me back.

341
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,280
Your dad brought me back.

342
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,582
You did.

343
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,355
I see how you've been
looking at your dad.

344
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:53,492
You don't have
to be afraid of me

345
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:55,994
or him.

346
00:26:01,004 --> 00:26:03,538
He told me the other day

347
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,774
that he was proud of me.

348
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:10,149
That I was a good man.

349
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,650
I'm not.

350
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:14,819
- Carl.
- I know more now. ( sniffles )

351
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:17,492
About what he wanted from me.

352
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,328
And I tried, but...

353
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:23,334
I still have these thoughts.

354
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:33,718
I'm not what he thinks I am.

355
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:39,987
I'm just another monster, too.

356
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,397
Just in case.

357
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:59,902
Woman:
<i>Terminus--</i>

358
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,634
<i>those who arrive survive.</i>

359
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:04,136
<i>Follow the tracks to the point</i>

360
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:06,607
where all lines intersect.

361
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,575
There are maps at the crossings

362
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:11,275
<i>to help guide you</i>
<i>with your journey.</i>

363
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:14,147
<i>Sanctuary for all.</i>

364
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:16,483
<i>Community for all.</i>

365
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,018
Those who arrive survive.

366
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,356
Terminus, sanctuary for all.

367
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:23,857
- Community for all.
- Hello.

368
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,358
Those who s--

369
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,659
Hello.

370
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:34,706
Well, I bet Albert
is on perimeter watch.

371
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:43,613
You here to rob us?

372
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:45,749
No.

373
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:50,786
We wanted to see you
before you saw us.

374
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,892
Makes sense.

375
00:28:56,894 --> 00:28:58,830
Usually we do this
where the tracks meet.

376
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:00,667
Ahem.

377
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,003
Welcome to Terminus.

378
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:07,340
I'm Gareth.

379
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:09,912
Looks like you've been
on the road for a good bit.

380
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,248
We have.

381
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,088
Rick. That's Carl,
Daryl, Michonne.

382
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:23,297
You're nervous.
I get it.

383
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:26,001
We were all the same way.

384
00:29:26,003 --> 00:29:28,772
We came here for sanctuary.

385
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:30,408
That what you're here for?

386
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:32,809
Yes.

387
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:34,542
Good.

388
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:37,213
You found it.
Hey, Alex.

389
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:39,748
This isn't as pretty
as the front.

390
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,316
We got nothing to hide,
but welcome wagon

391
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:44,018
is a whole lot nicer.

392
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,354
Alex will take you,
ask you a few questions.

393
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:49,156
Uh, but first,

394
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:51,659
we need to see
everyone's weapons.

395
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:53,861
If you could just lay them
down in front of you.

396
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:07,775
All right.

397
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,377
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes, I do.

398
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,223
I'd hate to see the other guy.

399
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:23,958
You would.

400
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,396
- They deserve it?
- Yes.

401
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,765
Just so you know, we aren't
those kind of people,

402
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,735
but we aren't stupid either.

403
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:40,676
And you shouldn't be stupid
enough to try anything stupid.

404
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,977
As long as everyone's clear on that,
we shouldn't have any problems.

405
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:45,681
Just solutions.

406
00:30:46,884 --> 00:30:48,452
Okay.

407
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:09,314
Follow me.

408
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:19,187
So how long's
this place been here?

409
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:21,487
Since almost the start.

410
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:23,420
When all the camps got overrun,

411
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:25,155
people started
finding this place.

412
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:27,858
I think it was instinct,
you know?

413
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,327
Follow a path.

414
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,829
<i>Some folks were</i>
<i>heading to the coast,</i>

415
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:34,063
others out west or up north,

416
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:36,964
but they all wound up here.

417
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,764
Hi.

418
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,734
Heard you came in
the back door. Smart.

419
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,503
You'll fit right in here.

420
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,602
Hey, Mary, would you fix each of
these new folks a plate for me?

421
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:52,208
Michonne:
<i>Why do you do it?</i>

422
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,011
Why do you let people in?

423
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:57,283
The more people become a
part of us, we get stronger.

424
00:31:57,285 --> 00:32:00,020
<i>That's why we put up the signs,</i>

425
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,390
<i>invite people in.</i>

426
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:04,292
<i>It's how we survive.</i>

427
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,062
Here.

428
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:18,740
No.

429
00:32:25,784 --> 00:32:28,020
Where the hell
did you get this watch?

430
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,670
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Grimes.

431
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,539
Thanks for grabbing these.

432
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:00,245
Well, I thought
Carl might want 'em.

433
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:03,551
They were just sitting there.

434
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:06,920
I figured it had been a while.

435
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:12,226
I'm not ashamed that
they're for ages four to 12.

436
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,728
You shouldn't be.

437
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,507
Hey.

438
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,077
Hey.

439
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,824
- Carl.
- Yes?

440
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:48,429
Carl.

441
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:51,132
I need your help
with something.

442
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:55,972
<i>Leave it behind.</i>

443
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:57,574
What?

444
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,450
It'll just get in the way.

445
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,055
Rick: <i>Where the hell did
you get this watch?</i>

446
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:11,258
You want answers?
You want anything else?

447
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,294
You get 'em when
you put down the gun.

448
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,764
I see your man on the
roof with a sniper rifle.

449
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:18,167
How good's his aim?
Where'd you get the watch?

450
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,476
- Where'd you get the watch?!
- Don't do anything!

451
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,480
I have this!
You just put it down.

452
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:30,316
You put it down!

453
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,019
You want to listen to me.
There's a lot of us.

454
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,889
Where did you get the watch?

455
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:37,391
I got it off of a dead one.

456
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:38,926
I didn't think he'd need it.

457
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,532
Rick: <i>What about the riot gear?
The poncho?</i>

458
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:46,436
Got the riot gear
off a dead cop.

459
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,405
Found the poncho
on a clothesline.

460
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,744
- Gareth, we can wait.
- Shut up, Alex.

461
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,346
You talk to me.

462
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:58,552
What's there left to say?

463
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,087
You don't trust us anymore.

464
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:02,290
- Gareth.
- Shut up.

465
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,726
- Gareth, please.
- It's okay.

466
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,495
It's okay.

467
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:09,265
Rick, what do you want?

468
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:11,168
Where are our people?

469
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,070
You didn't answer the question.

470
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:14,072
( gunfire )

471
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:15,840
- Man:<i> Go, go!</i>
- Gareth:<i> Hey!</i>

472
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,843
- ( men shouting )
- <i> ( radio chatter )</i>

473
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:19,779
Carl!

474
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,948
Get down, now!
Go!

475
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,118
Man over radio: <i>Shots fired in the main.
Heading into the building.</i>

476
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,621
Come on!

477
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,327
( gunfire )

478
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,364
Come on!

479
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,309
Here!

480
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:56,159
- Man over radio: <i> Stay on your shot.</i>
- ( gunfire )

481
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:04,436
- Come on, this way.
- Gareth:<i> Get them off B!</i>

482
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,876
<i>( radio chatter continues )</i>

483
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:18,087
- Voices:<i> Help! Help!</i>
- What the hell?

484
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,456
- <i> ( banging )</i>
- <i> Let us out!</i>

485
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,058
- <i> Help!</i>
- Keep going.

486
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,727
<i>Help!</i>

487
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:31,738
What the hell is this place?

488
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,876
These people, I don't think
they're trying to kill us.

489
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:38,346
Rick: <i>No, they were
aiming at our feet.</i>

490
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,184
There.

491
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:48,592
There.

492
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:50,061
Go!

493
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,735
( gunfire )

494
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:31,293
Gareth: Drop your weapons! Now!

495
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:45,107
<i>Now!</i>

496
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:54,016
Ringleader, go to your left.

497
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:56,185
<i>The train car, go.</i>

498
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:00,923
You do what we say,
the boy goes with you.

499
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:04,860
Anything else, he dies and
you end up in there anyway.

500
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,841
Now the archer.

501
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:30,385
Now the samurai.

502
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,812
Stand at the door, ringleader,

503
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:00,415
archer, samurai, in that order.

504
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:08,289
My son.

505
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,061
Go, kid.

506
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:23,304
<i>Ringleader, open the
door and go in.</i>

507
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:25,239
I'll go in with him.

508
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:26,941
Don't make us kill him now.

509
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,957
<i>( thuds )</i>

510
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,763
Rick?

511
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,203
You're here.

512
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,110
You're here.

513
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:53,126
They're our friends.

514
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,398
They helped save us.

515
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,267
Yeah.

516
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,070
Now they're friends of ours.

517
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:06,506
For however long that'll be.

518
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,709
No.

519
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:22,188
( laughs )
There you go, Judith.

520
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,956
There you go.

521
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,361
Put it in at more of an angle.

522
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:36,235
Whoa.

523
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:39,004
Gonna have to get you
a farming hat.

524
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,808
There's a new sheriff in town.

525
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,843
( all laugh )

526
00:41:44,845 --> 00:41:46,879
- How's it look?
- Looks good.

527
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,882
( laughing )

528
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:53,986
It can be like this
all the time.

529
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:58,190
It's like this now.

530
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:01,526
That's enough.

531
00:42:10,169 --> 00:42:13,872
They're gonna feel pretty
stupid when they find out.

532
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,110
Find out what?

533
00:42:34,226 --> 00:42:36,861
They're screwing
with the wrong people.
