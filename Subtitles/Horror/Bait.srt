1
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,885
(waves crashing)

2
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,156
(distant music playing)

3
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,103
(music stops)

4
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,574
(knocks)

5
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,814
Hey, get up.
It's time to check the buoy.

6
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,546
Come on, Josh.

7
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,183
(Josh grunts)

8
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,891
Oh, no.

9
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,258
So you regret
proposing to my sister?

10
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,329
What I regret is letting you
plan my engagement party.

11
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,169
(chuckles)
I know.

12
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,837
Here, get this into you.

13
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,039
It's my great-gran's
hangover remedy.

14
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,145
Oh--!

15
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,155
Smells like shit.

16
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,622
Oh, God.

17
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,662
You're spilling it.

18
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,961
You know,
once you get past the gag reflex,

19
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,597
- it's actually not that bad.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,566
Rory...?

21
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,044
I'll check the buoy.

22
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,912
Oh, my sister's down the beach.
She wants to show you something.

23
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,415
(sighs)

24
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,475
(car door opens, closes)

25
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,010
(car engine starts)

26
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,454
(car engine fades)

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,736
Rory: Looks like it's gonna be
a busy one. Want a hand with that?

28
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,572
What, you're actually gonna
get wet today?

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,601
Make a bit of a change,
wouldn't it?

30
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,876
(laughs)

31
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,496
Woman:
Hey.

32
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,728
I bet you've never seen
one of these.

33
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,100
Josh:
What is it?

34
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,800
Wow.

35
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,675
Were you looking at my butt?

36
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,203
No.

37
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,239
- No?
- Maybe.

38
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,759
(woman laughs)
Aww.

39
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,995
You look terrible.

40
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,940
Thanks.
It's your brother's fault.

41
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,509
But you smell nice.

42
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,383
You always smell nice.

43
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,045
Woman: Are you ready
to leave all this behind?

44
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,880
Where you go, I go.

45
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,818
Well, there won't be places like this
in Singapore.

46
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,695
Oh, we'll come back.

47
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,120
Lifeguard:
Shit.

48
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,790
Shark! Shark!

49
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,595
(voices shouting)

50
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,430
(siren blaring)

51
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,538
Get help!

52
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,238
Go get help!

53
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,746
Rory!

54
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,150
Get everyone out of the water!

55
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,216
Joe, give me a hand.

56
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,326
(yells)
Rory!

57
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,097
No!

58
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,304
Rory!

59
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,777
- Shark!
- I can't hear you.

60
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,746
- Shark!
- What?

61
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,582
Give me your hand.

62
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,195
Rory!

63
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,996
I got you. I got you.

64
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,106
No.

65
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,581
(howls)
No!

66
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,120
Along with
the yearly southern migration

67
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,222
of the humpback whales
along the East Coast waters,

68
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,132
"Surfline" surfing spokesman
Jeff Tripp said

69
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,796
people should be very vigilant
this time of year,

70
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,670
as we've seen large gatherings
of sharks in the waters

71
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,607
following the whales
along the coast.

72
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,007
Now, what they're doing

73
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,408
is hunting the whale calves

74
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,278
and bait fish
surrounding the migration.

75
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,982
TV reporter: So if you are heading
to the beaches,

76
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,824
please observe the signs
and swim only between the flags.

77
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,320
Great whites are expected
in the area over the next month.

78
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,357
And now, on a brighter note,

79
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,961
it's been a picture-perfect day
here on the East Coast

80
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,038
with blue skies
as far as the eye can see.

81
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,675
TV reporter:
No signs improving

82
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,612
for the sailors
and the windsurfers, however.

83
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,775
We seem to be hit
with the doldrums,

84
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,785
which means there are
no surface winds.

85
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,379
(chimes tinkling)

86
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,156
(distant dogs barking)

87
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,728
(howling)

88
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,972
(birds screeching)

89
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,549
(crow cawing)

90
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,986
(seagulls squawking)

91
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,157
(crows cawing)

92
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,640
(screeches)

93
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,243
Man in hood:
We gotta move to the car park.

94
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,678
Can't stay here.

95
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,705
(engine starts)

96
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,602
(man announcing over PA)

97
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,834
Woman:
Yes, please.

98
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,237
- Josh: Hey.
- Hey.

99
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,337
- Jessup come by yet?
- Not yet. You're safe.

100
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,371
Good morning, by the way.

101
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,313
Yeah.

102
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,429
(pop music playing)
¶ Shake your body ¶

103
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,167
¶ Shake your body ¶

104
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,868
¶ Shake your booty... ¶

105
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,274
(music stops)

106
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,403
Why are we stopping here?

107
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,781
- Hey, Kyle.
- Shh.

108
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,081
(keypad clicks)

109
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,456
You're bad.

110
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,586
- (dog whines)
- Woman: Hey.

111
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,459
(dog yapping)

112
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,659
Shut up.

113
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,517
What are you doing here?

114
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,032
Woman:
You scared me.

115
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,828
Happy anniversary.

116
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,602
You remembered.

117
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,474
11 months, baby.

118
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,140
It's not very much. It's just a song
playlist for when we go to Sydney.

119
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,649
Thank you. Thank you.

120
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,618
Ooh, and...

121
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,850
happy anniversary
to you too.

122
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,293
- Tell me you didn't steal these.
- Oh, Ryan.

123
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,559
Yeah, okay, okay,
put them back.

124
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,930
But then I have
nothing to give you.

125
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,594
Doesn't matter.
It's the thought that counts.

126
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,298
Put them back, okay?

127
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,498
Come on.

128
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,168
Oops, I hope we're not
interrupting anything.

129
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,275
You know, that's a really
cool jacket.

130
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,609
Thanks.

131
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,084
Bet it's got lots of pockets, huh?
Mind if we take a little peek?

132
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,290
Ryan:
She's gonna pay for it.

133
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,054
Just take it out of my paycheck
if you don't believe me.

134
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,220
Paycheck?

135
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,457
You're living
in a dream world, kid.

136
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,022
You're fired.

137
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:58,127
And you-- shoplifting,
destruction of property.

138
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,035
I've already called the cops.

139
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,698
Did you see all those birds
this morning?

140
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,074
There must have been
thousands.

141
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,444
You know, there were crows
and magpies and everything.

142
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,886
When did you get back?

143
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,898
Tina, this is what you want?

144
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,898
Josh, this is--

145
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,270
Oh, Jesus.
Josh, look at you.

146
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,774
Go clean yourself up.

147
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,671
Jessup:
No, not the customer bathroom.

148
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,195
I got the call.

149
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,373
Oh, shit.

150
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,675
(dog yapping)

151
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,737
(Kyle moaning)

152
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,740
Kyle:
Whoa! Hello.

153
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,820
Man in hood:
You starting to hear something

154
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,849
stirring around
that head of yours?

155
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,162
The office is at the back
of the store.

156
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,499
Cash pickup's in 10 minutes,
so you've got five to get out.

157
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,471
(gun hammer clicks)

158
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,873
When this is done,

159
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,275
we're straight.

160
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,178
My brother's clean

161
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,978
and I don't want to ever see
your face around him again.

162
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,746
You understand me?

163
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,952
Man in hood:
Whatever you say.

164
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,966
(kisses)

165
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,408
(sighs)

166
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,477
I want her charged
this time.

167
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,558
She didn't steal this.

168
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,724
This is hers.

169
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,328
We both know you're not gonna
go through with it.

170
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,932
Just stop,
because I'm this close.

171
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,238
To what?
Arresting me?

172
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,210
Yeah, real A-plus
parenting, Dad.

173
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,338
- Jaimie, you're too smart to--
- Oh, you just dropped

174
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,611
to a C-minus
due to lack of originality.

175
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,344
Okay, okay, what about this?

176
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,377
I'm gonna process you
this time.

177
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,252
You can spend the day
in lockup.

178
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,881
And what do you think
that's gonna do?

179
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,654
Maybe it's the wake-up call
you need.

180
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,290
Piss off.

181
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,266
What do you think your mother
would have thought about all of this?

182
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,603
Piss off!

183
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,491
(sighs)

184
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,668
(car lock chirps)

185
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,067
Put that on.
That's it.

186
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,542
- Thanks.
- Great.

187
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,898
Jessup:
What the--?

188
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,240
Give me the money.

189
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,475
Shit, man, there's no money
in the safe.

190
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,579
Give me the money.

191
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,921
All right, just--
just take it easy, okay?

192
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,224
(beeping)

193
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,639
Jessup:
You see?

194
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,006
Where is it?

195
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,811
Cashier: Do you want
a separate bag for that?

196
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,203
(cocks gun)

197
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,889
Man in hood:
Hey, drop that fucking gun...

198
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,022
- (woman screaming)
-...or I'll do this bitch!

199
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,531
Where's the money?

200
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,660
You-- I said,
put the guns down!

201
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,932
Put 'em down!

202
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,933
(knocks rhythmically)

203
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,435
(knocking)

204
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,982
Thank you.

205
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,720
My dad was totally--

206
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,817
Your dad's right, Jaimes.

207
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,088
Not you too.

208
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,619
I lost my job today
because of you.

209
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,962
Who cares?
You hated that job anyway.

210
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,025
I care. I care.

211
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,969
Well, if it's that important
to you,

212
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,801
I'll go get your
stupid job back, then.

213
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,000
- Jaimie, just--
- No. Watch.

214
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:57,079
Oi! Freak boy
from history class, right?

215
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,147
(laughs)

216
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,660
(engine grinds)

217
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,031
(sighs)

218
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,973
(engine grinds)

219
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,108
(plumbing groans,
sputters)

220
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,721
(gunshots popping)

221
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,191
(women screaming)

222
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,490
You, get here.

223
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,393
- Get here.
- Tina: No.

224
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,330
You, get over there.
Stay back.

225
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,832
- No.
- Stay back.

226
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,391
Woman:
Do as you're told.

227
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,528
What the fuck did you do?

228
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,595
Tina:
Josh.

229
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,300
Get back.

230
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,332
Hood: Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

231
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:54,402
Don't be a hero, mate.
Stay back.

232
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,572
Tina.

233
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,843
Josh:
No!

234
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,578
Hood:
Stop it.

235
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,314
(low rumbling)

236
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,345
Woman:
What was that?

237
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,721
(rattling)

238
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,454
What--?

239
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,725
Man:
Down! Down!

240
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,898
- Come on.
- (child screams)

241
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,029
(people shouting)

242
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,768
Oh.

243
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,343
Man on video: I should know,
I built the store.

244
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,087
Woman:
Hurry up. This way.

245
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,989
Man:
Come on, come on!

246
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,389
Man:
Go! Run!

247
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,796
(gasps, screams)

248
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,033
(screams)

249
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,203
(crashes)

250
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,877
(wires fizzling)

251
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,437
(gasps)

252
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,509
Hey!

253
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,986
Over here!

254
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,249
Josh:
Have you seen anyone?

255
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,396
Anyone else?
Anyone?

256
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,862
Man:
I need help.

257
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,269
Anybody?

258
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,136
Help!

259
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,766
- Josh: Hey.
- Here.

260
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,767
Where's Tina?

261
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,440
Where's Tina?

262
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,472
Jesus Christ.

263
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,508
Can you help him?
I don't know what to do.

264
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,985
- Just calm down.
- Can you help him?

265
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,920
Calm down.

266
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,822
What the hell's happening?
What just happened?

267
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,587
We gotta get him
out of the water.

268
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,618
Help me lift him
onto this shelf.

269
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,710
I need you to go and find
anything you can to wrap this leg--

270
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,735
towels, electrical tape--
I don't care.

271
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,110
Okay.

272
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,685
Jaimie:
Dad? Dad!

273
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,521
My God. Jaimie!

274
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,548
Dad?

275
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,321
- Jaimie.
- Dad!

276
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,356
Here, give me your hand.

277
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,933
Jaimie.

278
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,099
Da--

279
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,905
Dad.

280
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,971
How did you get out?

281
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,745
I was in the car.

282
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,412
I was in the car park, and...

283
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,422
Ryan-- Ryan--

284
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,651
Oh, my God.

285
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,490
Oh, my God,
Ryan's still in the car park.

286
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,621
- Forget it, kid.
- Ryan's still in the car park.

287
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,528
Forget it.

288
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,829
If it's flooded up here,

289
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,529
they've had it down there.

290
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,500
(gasps)

291
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,216
(grunting)

292
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,832
Tina?

293
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,535
Tina!

294
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,640
Okay, I need your help.

295
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,341
I need you to help
your dad, okay?

296
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,010
Put your hands here
and keep pressure on his leg.

297
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,019
Can you do that for me?

298
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,543
You'll be fine.

299
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,078
Tina.

300
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,258
Tina. Hey.

301
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,159
You're okay.

302
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,262
Look at me.

303
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,296
You're okay.

304
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,605
What-- what happened?

305
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,304
Where are all the people?

306
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,677
Hey, come on.

307
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,213
Here, give me your hand.

308
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,096
- Help me. Help me.
- Okay, okay.

309
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,506
- Help me.
- Calm down. Calm down.

310
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,108
(water splattering)

311
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,886
Kyle: Help!
We're trapped!

312
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,262
- Someone get us out of here!
- Heather: Is anyone there?

313
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,290
- Anyone? Anyone?
- Help!

314
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,734
Somebody help us, please.

315
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,294
- (dull thump)
- (gasps)

316
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,670
Did you hear that?

317
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,335
- Did you hear that?
- Shh. Stop talking.

318
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,537
(gasps)

319
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,975
Where did it go?
Do you hear it?

320
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,747
Not when you don't
shut up.

321
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,983
Well, excuse me
for helping, Kyle, really.

322
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,217
(thumps)

323
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,316
It's behind you.
It's behind you.

324
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,691
Yeah, you find that noise.
You find it.

325
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,628
Good boy, Bully.
Good boy.

326
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,132
(Bully yapping)

327
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,766
(yelps)

328
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,802
(gasps)

329
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,939
Shit.

330
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,847
Fuck. Fuck.

331
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,874
(panting)

332
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,260
Fuck.

333
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,403
Can anybody hear me?

334
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,108
Hello?

335
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,622
(faint rumbling)

336
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,729
Is anybody there?

337
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,892
Oh, fuck.

338
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,466
Oh.

339
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,340
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

340
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:37,655
(gasps)

341
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,714
(gasps)

342
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,212
(cloth ripping)

343
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,252
Josh:
Are you ready?

344
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,756
(screams)

345
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,099
We've got to get out of here.

346
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,128
We can't stay here.
We've got to get help.

347
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,199
What--?

348
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,767
Oh, shit.

349
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,521
Don't let him
out of your sight.

350
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,761
The water's still rising.

351
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,290
No, no, it can't be.

352
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,394
The whole bloody town
must be flooded up there.

353
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,201
No, it's not.
Look, they're gonna come for us.

354
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,470
They know we're down here.
They're gonna come for us.

355
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,773
Doyle: That's assuming there's
someone still up there to come.

356
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,803
- You, this is all your fault.
- Not mine, boy, not today.

357
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,180
Today Mother Nature saw us all
as sinners down here.

358
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,276
Why don't you just shut up?

359
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,514
He can't swim anywhere
with this leg.

360
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,017
Josh:
I'll stay here.

361
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,585
You guys find a way out
and bring a rescue team back.

362
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,426
Tina:
What? No, Josh, wait.

363
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,432
Bob:
Well, how do we get out?

364
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,402
With the car park flooded,
that leaves only

365
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,769
the loading bay storeroom
and the front entrance.

366
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,900
Josh, you cannot stay here, okay?
You know as well as I do

367
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,172
this is gonna bring aftershocks with it.
It's gonna bring more--

368
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,577
More waves, I know.

369
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,877
So you'll have to be quick.

370
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,481
Okay, well, Steven and l
will check the front.

371
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,436
I'll take the loading bay.

372
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,874
I don't think so.

373
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,004
- Bob?
- Yep.

374
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,378
You go.

375
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,914
Okay.

376
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,777
Kyle: Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

377
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,116
How could you not have
charged your phone?

378
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,089
I can't do everything, Kyle.
God, why didn't you charge it?

379
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,114
Uh, because it's not
my phone.

380
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,650
Oh, well, then where is your phone?
Hello.

381
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,561
Oh, well, that's much better.

382
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,629
- (Bully growls)
- What is it, Bully?

383
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,196
Why are you growling
like that?

384
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,105
Because he's
a fucking retard.

385
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,407
That is not funny, Kyle.
You're not a retard, Bully.

386
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,903
(low whistle)

387
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,509
(barking)

388
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,884
What the hell was that?

389
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,116
I have no idea.

390
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:50,267
(coughs)

391
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,591
(buzzing)

392
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,838
(cable buzzing)

393
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,577
What's that?

394
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,584
Where did it go?

395
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,560
Get everyone
out of the water.

396
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,829
Jaimie:
What?

397
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,928
Get everyone
out of the water now!

398
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,370
What's happening?

399
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,966
Tina!
Out of the water now!

400
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,840
- Bob: Can't get out that way.
- Josh: Hurry!

401
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,572
It's blocked.

402
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,170
Out of the water!

403
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,772
Quick, swim.

404
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,806
What's going on?

405
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,512
Josh: Tina, Steven,
get out of the water!

406
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,680
(gulps)

407
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,518
Collins?

408
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,289
Tina, hurry!

409
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,264
Where is he?
Where did he go?

410
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,706
(screams)

411
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,802
- Oh!
- Shit.

412
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,281
Jaimie, get back.

413
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,757
Help me!
Please help me!

414
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,283
Help me!

415
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,402
(yelps, gasps)

416
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,615
Shit.

417
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,723
Where did it go?
Did you see it?

418
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,886
What the hell could do that?
What is in here?

419
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,020
(buzzing)

420
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,120
There.

421
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,193
(gasps)

422
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,369
(all scream)

423
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,271
Doyle:
Give me your hand.

424
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,745
Ow, my hand.

425
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,679
Jesus Christ.

426
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,683
- That had to be five feet.
- What had to be five feet?

427
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,284
- Six.
- Six? What do you mean, six?

428
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,296
Tina: Six feet from the tip
of the dorsal to the tip of the tail.

429
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,389
Jessup: So what the hell
does that mean?

430
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,901
It means there's a 12-foot
great white shark in here.

431
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,907
(panting)

432
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,218
Fuck!

433
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,477
- I can't see anything.
- Just keep calm, babe.

434
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,639
We have to get out of this car.
I can't stay here much longer.

435
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,715
Give me your shoes.

436
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:30,913
Excuse me?

437
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,549
Well, I need something with a point
to break the windscreen.

438
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,354
Give me your shoes.

439
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,292
Are you crazy?
These are $300 Gucci.

440
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,228
They're gonna get wet anyway.
Just give me your shoes.

441
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,855
- No.
- Heather, give--

442
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,492
- I'm not giving you my Gucci.
- (barking)

443
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,261
They're not Gucci.

444
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,173
Um, clue-- you gave them to me
for Christmas last year,

445
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,074
and you said that they were
$300 Guccis.

446
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,046
Um, clue-- I know I did,
and they're not.

447
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,413
(gasps)

448
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,940
You bought me fake Gucci.

449
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,509
You wouldn't have known
if I didn't just tell you.

450
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,579
I can't believe you.
Fake Gucci?

451
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:07,750
Just give me your shoes.

452
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,822
What are you doing?

453
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,103
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,975
Ryan:
Hey! Hey, over here.

455
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,316
Kyle:
Freak boy? Is that you?

456
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,516
Jesus Christ, I never thought
I'd actually be happy to see you.

457
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,390
Kyle: Yeah, no shit. Did you find
anyone? Is there anyone else?

458
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,519
Ryan: There's bodies everywhere.
There's no one alive.

459
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,292
Kyle: Well, did you check
the ramp?

460
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,424
Ryan: It's all jammed up.
I can't get through.

461
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,264
You got a phone
or something in there?

462
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,464
Kyle:
Uh, no.

463
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,133
Holy shit, Kyle. Kyle!

464
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,165
What? What?

465
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,109
Ryan:
Oh, Jesus Christ.

466
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,940
Oh, shit.

467
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,484
(Bully barking, growling)

468
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,212
(gasps)

469
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,457
It's okay.

470
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,122
- I think it's gone.
- (barking)

471
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:21,529
Oh, shit.

472
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,499
(screams)

473
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,702
Oh, man,
this is not happening.

474
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,707
This is so not happening.

475
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,971
You-- you're a cop, right?

476
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,410
You gotta do something.

477
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,539
For Christsakes, do something.

478
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,913
Do you have any ideas?

479
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,180
Oh, you think
this is funny, do you?

480
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,949
- More ironic, really.
- Oh, really? Well, please share.

481
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,584
I'm sure we could all do
with a good ironic laugh right now.

482
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,617
Doyle:
Think about it.

483
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,789
You bust your ass in here
eight hours a day, seven days a week.

484
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,492
Right?

485
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,194
You'll probably hump away like that
for the next 40 years.

486
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,937
So whatever way you cut it,
this place was gonna kill you.

487
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,738
Now it's just sooner
rather than later.

488
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:09,075
You son of a bitch.

489
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,445
I want you to know,

490
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,248
the woman you killed--
her name was Julie

491
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,378
and she was a friend.

492
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,412
- I didn't kill anyone.
- It makes no difference.

493
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,981
She died during your robbery,
so it's your fault, you bastard.

494
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,324
If we get out of here alive, I swear
I'm gonna make you fucking pay.

495
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,488
Enough!

496
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,758
It's coming back.

497
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,732
Why does it keep doing that--
just circling?

498
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,764
Tina: Because it's not sure
what we are.

499
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,537
It's curious.

500
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,066
Jessup:
Curious about what?

501
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,410
A shark's only curious
about one thing.

502
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,042
It's trying to decide
if we're food or not.

503
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,076
(rumbling, banging)

504
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,256
- What was that?
- Todd: Hang on, everybody.

505
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,692
Just hang on.

506
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,127
(woman yelps)

507
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,763
(buzzing, popping)

508
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,400
We have another problem.

509
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,410
(laughing)

510
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,641
Why are you laughing?

511
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,615
'Cause he just realized
when the water hits those cables,

512
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,914
this whole place will light up
like a Christmas tree.

513
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,944
Jessup, where do we
shut it down?

514
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,687
The storage room.

515
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,163
All the power mains
are in the storage room.

516
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,857
I'll go.

517
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,234
- What?
- Everyone go to the end of the shelf,

518
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,865
make as much noise
as you can.

519
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,397
I'll swim for it.

520
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,875
Tina:
Josh, no.

521
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,743
I mean, you can't.
Your arm-- look at your arm.

522
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,941
I mean, the shark will go
straight for you.

523
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,348
You can't, not with that.

524
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,648
I don't think we have
any other options.

525
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,725
Hold on.

526
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,222
I have an idea.

527
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,369
Do you see it anywhere?

528
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,501
Yeah, I see it, but I'm keeping it
a secret from you

529
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,171
because I want you
to be surprised.

530
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,407
Oh, well, thank you for your
thoughtfulness, Kyle, really.

531
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,575
It's what I always dreamed of
in a boyfriend.

532
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,449
Oh, I can't handle this
much longer.

533
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,389
It may surprise you,
but I am not equipped

534
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,324
to deal with this kind
of situation.

535
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,818
Here, Bully,
I need some space.

536
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,865
(Heather screams)

537
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,198
(Bully barking)

538
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,601
Kyle, do something.
You have to do something.

539
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,765
Like what?
Ask the fucking thing to go away?

540
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,365
- (screams)
- Oh, shit.

541
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,708
- Help!
- Help us, please! Help us!

542
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,138
Get down. Get down.
Get down.

543
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,715
Help us!
Do something!

544
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,055
- Okay.
- Help us!

545
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,566
All right, just get back
in the car.

546
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,694
Just stay as still and quiet
as possible.

547
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,966
- What, are you fucking insane?
- Just listen, listen.

548
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,939
Why don't you jump in the water
and do a couple of laps?

549
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,703
All right, just listen to me.
You gotta keep still, okay?

550
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,972
The more you scream,
the more the shark's gonna come.

551
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,707
Hey, hey, just get back in
and wait.

552
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,510
I'm gonna get the shark
to come to me.

553
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,982
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

554
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,577
When I get it over here,
you swim like hell

555
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,055
for my van over there.
You see it?

556
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,318
This is crazy.

557
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,763
Babe, look at me.

558
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,533
Don't move.

559
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,666
Stay here as still as you can.
Can you do that?

560
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:09,887
(buzzing, popping)

561
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,650
(buzzing, popping)

562
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,486
You think this will work?

563
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,392
Man:
Absolutely.

564
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,990
I wouldn't eat a cheeseburger
with its wrapping on.

565
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,864
But of course...

566
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,893
I'm not a shark.

567
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,599
(laughing)

568
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,040
Here.

569
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,066
Yeah.

570
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,880
Look...

571
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,890
you don't know me...

572
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,995
- but when Tina came to Singapore--
- I don't want to know about it.

573
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,968
Well, you should.

574
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,330
We were never--

575
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,338
The whole time she was there...

576
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,117
she missed you.

577
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,312
It wasn't your fault--

578
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,756
what happened.

579
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,051
That's what she said.

580
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,756
Hey, I found some water.

581
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,893
Good?

582
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,606
You come back, okay?

583
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,414
Just come back.

584
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,223
Ready?

585
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,090
Here you go.

586
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,676
(buzzing)

587
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,870
(buzzing)

588
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,406
Oh, shit.

589
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,350
(grunts)

590
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,745
Oh, man, he's not
gonna make it.

591
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,633
(buzzing stops)

592
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,661
He did it.

593
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,937
- He did it.
- Where is he, Josh?

594
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,728
(gasping)

595
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,645
No!

596
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,519
(sobs)
No.

597
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,729
Fuck it. No!

598
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,022
Hey... are you okay?

599
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,023
Look,

600
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,294
we've got to try
to keep it together.

601
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,324
Okay?

602
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,733
Tina:
I know. I just--

603
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,103
(shudders)
When's it gonna end?

604
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,842
And why is this happening?

605
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,392
Why?

606
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,154
When my mom was dying--

607
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,327
she died two years ago--

608
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,497
she was so sick.

609
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,009
I tried.

610
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,039
A couple of months
before she died, I left.

611
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,278
I couldn't take it.

612
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,786
I just took off to America.

613
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,051
And...

614
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,581
I wasn't there

615
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,616
when...

616
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,127
So this is my payback.

617
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,160
Life saying, "Screw you.

618
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,831
How are you gonna
run away from this?"

619
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,948
(grunts)

620
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,981
Here.

621
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,255
There's a secret to it.

622
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,521
You have to do it gently.

623
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,727
Just peel the two
pieces of plastic apart

624
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,759
Iike that.

625
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,804
Thanks.

626
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,569
Was she a friend of yours--
the girl that got killed?

627
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,843
Julie?

628
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,873
No, not really.

629
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,977
I mean, I knew her
and everything, but--

630
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,449
It was just supposed
to be me, you know?

631
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,485
A quick in and out.
Nobody else, just me.

632
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,698
I guess it's true what they say--

633
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,725
"Let the devil take your hand

634
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,703
and God will make you pay."

635
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,375
Todd: We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we?

636
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,140
I don't believe that.

637
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,339
No.

638
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,476
We'll make it out of here.

639
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,687
Good.

640
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,120
(sighs)

641
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,830
(grunts)

642
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,676
Ryan: Oh, shit, it's working.
It's working.

643
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,579
Go now.
Go, go now, now.

644
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,106
Kyle:
Come on, go, go, go.

645
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,052
Fuck! Swim!

646
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,315
- Ryan: Swim!
- Kyle: Climb! Just climb!

647
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,917
Sorry, Bully.

648
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,590
- (Heather screams)
- Fuck!

649
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,792
Kyle:
Stay back!

650
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,060
Heather:
Bully! Bully!

651
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,095
(panting)

652
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,608
Fuck!

653
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,278
(faint muttering)

654
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,254
You need to
slide it through...

655
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,417
not fling it.

656
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,567
It's strong, but it can't
take much weight.

657
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,848
Screw this.
I'm out of here.

658
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,756
If you can get through,
you get help and bring them back.

659
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,528
Yeah, yeah,
all right, all right.

660
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,039
- Ready?
- Let's go.

661
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:27,817
Got it?

662
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,101
- (screams)
- (screams)

663
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:56,084
- Pull him up!
- I can make it. I can make it.

664
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,952
- Pull up now.
- I can make it. I'm okay.

665
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:01,889
(screaming)

666
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,271
(crunching)

667
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,609
Give me your hand.

668
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,228
Are you gonna talk to me
or what?

669
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,070
No.

670
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,133
- Heather, I didn't--
- Don't.

671
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,839
Don't even try.

672
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,006
Murderer.

673
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:04,612
I'm not a murderer.

674
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,417
Oh, yes, you are.

675
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,119
You're a dog murderer,
which is worse than a person murderer.

676
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,218
How could you?

677
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,356
Heather, I didn't have
a choice.

678
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,391
Bullshit.
You always have a choice.

679
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,234
Murderer.

680
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,467
Whatever.

681
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,878
(groans)

682
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,849
Argh!

683
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,414
Uh!

684
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,242
Ryan:
Hey. Hey.

685
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,272
Can that pipe
hold my weight?

686
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,308
I can't get out this way.
I want to get to that door.

687
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,048
What do you think?

688
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,953
Kyle: I don't know.
Give it a go.

689
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,794
- Kyle: You all right?
- Yeah.

690
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,830
Ryan:
Can you see it anywhere?

691
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,308
Kyle: I don't know.
You're the one with the bloody torch.

692
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,846
Shit.

693
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,619
Kyle:
Are you okay?

694
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,724
Whew.

695
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,797
Ooh, Jesus.

696
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,268
- Kyle: Are you all right?
- Yeah.

697
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,979
Good stuff.
Keep going.

698
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,985
Heather:
Is he gonna make it?

699
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,611
Kyle:
Babe, shut up.

700
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,022
Shit.

701
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,030
You're good. You got,
like, six feet. Keep going.

702
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,967
(grunts)

703
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:46,076
(grunts)

704
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,776
Oh, shit.
Hold on.

705
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:49,375
Grab on. Grab on.

706
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,908
Shit.

707
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:56,849
Both: Swim, swim, swim.
Quick, quick.

708
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,693
- Heather: Quick.
- Got you, buddy.

709
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,789
(Heather screams)

710
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,323
Kyle! No!

711
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,598
- Quick, quick.
- Give me your hand.

712
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,834
Give me your hand!

713
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,469
Doyle: We're not gonna just
sit around and wait for that thing

714
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,441
to pick us off one by one.

715
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,409
And what do you think
you're gonna do?

716
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,435
At the very least, I'm gonna die
on my own terms

717
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,140
and not when that damn fish
decides it's time.

718
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,445
So you think what?

719
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,678
You're gonna catch it?

720
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,015
Why not?

721
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,523
What are you gonna do
if you catch it?

722
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,724
Spark up the barbie
and crack open the tartare sauce?

723
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:10,493
I'm gonna tie it to this shelf

724
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,592
and we're gonna swim like hell
to the entrance.

725
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,569
Get the hell out of here.

726
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:17,128
All I need isa hook.

727
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,473
You can't save everybody, mate.

728
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,672
You must be getting used
to that by now.

729
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,008
Josh:
It's not that far.

730
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,284
If we can distract
the shark,

731
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,789
I'll swim it,

732
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,792
get the hooks.

733
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,520
I'll do it.

734
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,033
What? Dad, no.

735
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,830
Oh, you can't,
not with your leg.

736
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,359
My leg is exactly
why I should go.

737
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,928
Dad, no, please.

738
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,205
You keep
my daughter safe.

739
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,472
No matter what happens,
you get her out of here, okay?

740
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,949
(grunts)

741
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,352
Jaimie!

742
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,329
Jaimie! Jaimie!

743
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,958
Tina: Naomi, make noise,
get the shark to come toward us.

744
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:23,203
Josh: Hurry, quick,
make some noise!

745
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,621
Jaimes, are you okay?

746
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,226
Yeah.

747
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,202
Okay, hang on.

748
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,173
Doyle:
Jump!

749
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,841
(gasps)

750
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,996
(gasps)

751
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,828
Good work, kid.

752
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,782
So what's the deal?

753
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,953
Do you know her
or just want to?

754
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,933
I used to.

755
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,628
Used to, huh?

756
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,659
'Cause I can see by that look
in your eye,

757
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,002
whatever was there,
still is.

758
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,173
That was a long time ago.

759
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:20,385
Trust me,
after this shit here,

760
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,822
everything we knew
is a long time ago.

761
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,542
You still wear that.

762
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,110
Yeah.

763
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,192
- Tina--
- You don't have to.

764
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,564
- We don't have to do this, Josh.
- No, I do.

765
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,031
I wasn't fair to you.

766
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,400
I just--

767
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,947
I always set the buoy.

768
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,251
Rory did it for me that day.

769
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,549
But I should have been
the one out there.

770
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:31,753
Josh.

771
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,126
And I hated myself.

772
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,964
But...

773
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:43,563
before I knew
what had happened,

774
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,905
everything just...

775
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,137
slipped away.

776
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,646
And I'm sorry.

777
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,318
I just wanted to say that.

778
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,191
I'm sorry.

779
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,460
The thing is, Josh...

780
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,031
you never had to say
sorry to me.

781
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,607
All you had to do
was say it to yourself.

782
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,943
I would have been there.

783
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,724
Doyle: Hey, you all secure
down there?

784
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,860
Josh:
Yeah.

785
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,885
Why didn't it take it?

786
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:19,129
Well, if you ask me,
I think it's pretty obvious.

787
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,295
After the past
couple of hours,

788
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,363
it's decided it prefers
live bait.

789
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,839
That's not funny.

790
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,967
Do I look like I'm joking?

791
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,001
Get down!

792
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,945
You stay back.
Stay back!

793
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,210
I saved this last bullet
for you, Doyle.

794
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,114
- You son of a bitch.
- Todd: You.

795
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:37,812
What about the mask
on the body?

796
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,844
(gunman laughing)

797
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,948
Wasn't me, mate.

798
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,391
Now, how about
we get ourselves a shark?

799
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,157
It really is
a pretty good idea.

800
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,563
We just need better bait.

801
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,432
And this looks pretty tasty,
eh, Doyle?

802
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,461
Kirby, listen to me.

803
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,530
You don't want to do this.

804
01:12:58,574 --> 01:12:59,836
Don't l?

805
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,365
No.

806
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,901
Todd: What you did earlier
doesn't matter right now.

807
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:07,473
So you let her go
and we can work something out.

808
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,108
Shut up, cop.

809
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,016
Don't bullshit me.

810
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,580
I shot someone.
That's not going away.

811
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,614
Now, I'm getting out of here

812
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,523
and I'm catching
this fucking shark.

813
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:24,292
And whatever happens...
happens.

814
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,164
- Get in there!
- (yells)

815
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,692
- Josh, no.
- Anyone thinks about touching her,

816
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,500
you go in too.

817
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,012
(grunts)

818
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,245
Tina:
Naomi, here.

819
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,350
Tina:
You're okay. Okay.

820
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,826
So you want to help?

821
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,193
You think it needs live bait?

822
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,763
Well...

823
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,168
(screaming)

824
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,705
Let's give it what it wants.

825
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:15,275
(Kirby screaming)

826
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:56,914
Oh, my God.

827
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,086
It's worked.

828
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,118
Now let's get out of here.

829
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,801
I don't think
anyone's coming for us.

830
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,768
I think if they were,
they'd be here by now.

831
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,214
I don't know.

832
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,413
Maybe they're trying

833
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,183
and they're just dealing
with the same shit we are.

834
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,932
- (Bully barking)
- Bully?

835
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:40,962
Bully!

836
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,631
Oh, float over.

837
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,333
No, don't. No.

838
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:47,870
- Come on, Bully.
- Baby, swim.

839
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:51,938
Grab him quick.

840
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:59,252
(laughs)
Yay. Bully.

841
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,918
It's a sign.
I know it is.

842
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,123
Yay.

843
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,799
Heather:
You're a good boy.

844
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:19,764
Get up.

845
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,362
Todd: It's okay, sweetheart.
Come on.

846
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,839
(rhythmic banging)

847
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:57,675
(banging)

848
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,176
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. Call it a sign.

849
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:06,845
(bangs rhythmically)

850
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,518
What is that?

851
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,527
It's Ryan.

852
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:15,792
Oh, my God, it's Ryan.

853
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,458
I have to go get him.

854
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,599
Jaimie, no. Jaimes.

855
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,967
Go after her, please.

856
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,743
Josh.

857
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,069
I'll be back soon.

858
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,935
He's down there.
I know he is.

859
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,336
Wait here.

860
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,619
Is he there?
Did you see anyone?

861
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,583
All right, give mea hand.

862
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,618
We have to close this door,

863
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,654
so that when we open
the one downstairs,

864
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,495
we don't flood the car park.

865
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,014
- Jaimie!
- Ryan!

866
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,754
- There's a shark. Get out of the water.
- Quick, quick! Go, go!

867
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,819
Heather:
Go, quick!

868
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,823
(banging)

869
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,335
Give me your hand!

870
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,736
(yells)

871
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,262
Come on.

872
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:39,705
Josh!

873
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,506
Come on!

874
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,378
(screams)

875
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,680
It's Dad's car.
There's a gun.

876
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,416
- What?
- There's a gun in the back.

877
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,355
Go to the other side.
Get the shark to come to you.

878
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,358
Jaimie:
Hurry! Come on!

879
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,428
Hurry, quick!

880
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,211
- (both yelp)
- (barks)

881
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,713
Josh, quick! Josh!

882
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,011
Come on, quick.
Come on.

883
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,418
(Heather screams)

884
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,233
(yells)

885
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,771
(Heather screams)

886
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:18,497
Naomi:
No go this side.

887
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:23,570
(buzzing)

888
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,617
Make sure everyone's
out of the water, okay?

889
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,760
- Dad.
- Jaimes?

890
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,694
Jaimie!

891
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,843
Get everyone behind the ramp
and out of the water.

892
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,404
You know
what you're doing?

893
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,246
I'm gonna hook this up

894
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,946
and I'm gonna blow us
a way out of here.

895
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,082
(rumbling)

896
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:50,764
Hold on!

897
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,767
(women screaming)

898
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,913
- (women whimpering)
- (Bully barking)

899
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,359
Is everyone okay?

900
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:21,828
Todd:
Yeah.

901
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,694
- Tina!
