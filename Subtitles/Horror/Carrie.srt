00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,035
Hours after you come out of
the back doors of your motels?

169
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,839
Soon all we will have is each other

170
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,713
And that could be enough,

171
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,709
If you will let us have
room enough and air enough

172
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,709
And peace enough to love each other

175
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,155
...this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

Atalent extraordinary for <i>you, </i>
Tommy Ross.

You know, this is slightly differentfrom
running touchdowns or hitting home runs.

179

Anyone?

180

- It's beautiful.

Carrie White! Beautiful.

182
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,676

Is it, Carrie, hmm?

186

Well, I'm afraid this is hardly a criticism.

Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

211
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Do any of you ever stop to think?

212
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,594
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates and the prom.

213
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,878
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

214
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,471
Billy Nolan.

215
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,875
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

216
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,833
- I'm sorry, could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan!

217
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,108
Well, isn't he the lucky one!

218
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,960
What about you, Sue?

219
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,197
- Who's taking you?
- Tommy Ross.

220
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,433
Right.

221
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,310
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension...

222
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,954
...and refusal of your prom tickets.

223
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,278
- What?!
- God!

224
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,479
That'd get you where you live,
wouldn't it? And you deserve it.

225
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,434
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

226
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,392
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

227
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,035
Still, there's one little catch.

228
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,268
It's to be <i>my</i> detention.

229
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,475
That's 50 minutes every day,
starting today, on the athletic field.

230
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,390
- Get the picture?
- I'm not coming.

231
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,472
That's up to you, Chris.

232
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,716
That's up to all of you.

233
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,835
Punishmentfor skipping detention
is three days' suspension...

234
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,679
...and refusal of your prom tickets.

235
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,711

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,196
Yeah? What are you reading?

343
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,432
It's about, uh... sewing.

344
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,516
Sewing. That's good.

345
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,718
Um...

346
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,074
If you don't have a date for the prom next
Friday, would you like to go with me?

347
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,031
- What?
- To the prom.

348
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,869
It's next Friday.
I know this is late notice, but they...

349
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,956
Carrie? Carrie, let...

350
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,108
You guys go on. Practise those drills
from yesterday. I'll be right there.

351
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,876
Carrie?

352
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,357
Carrie.

353
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,195
Hey, Carrie, what's the matter?

354
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
- What happened?
- Nothin'.

355
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,514
Was it one ofthe girls?

356
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,359
- Did one ofthe girls do somethin' to you?
- No.

357
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,434
Well, what is it, then?
You can trust me. You know that?

358
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,315
- Would you tell me?
- I got invited to the prom.

359
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,556
<i>(laughs)</i>

360
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,958
That's great! That's fantastic!
So what are you mopin' around for?

361
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,715
- Tommy Ross asked me.
- That's even better.

362
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,879
- He's really cute, huh?
- I know who he goes around with.

363
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,638
They're just tryin'
to trick me again, I know.

364
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,232
Maybe not.
I mean... maybe he really meant it.

365
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,710
Let's think about this, now.

366
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,230
It might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.

367
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,191
Carrie?

368
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,711
Hey, Carrie, I wanna talk to you. It's about
this attitude you have about yourself.

369
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,515
You're always walkin' around
with your hair down, all mopin' around...

370
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,596
Carrie?

371
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,110
Come here, you big silly.
I want you to look at yourself.

372
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,356
Would you look at that?

373
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,476
Come on.

374
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,956
Now, that's a pretty girl.
Look at your eyes!

375
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,712
Little mascara to bring it out?

376
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,437
Your lips... Try some lipstick. You have
nice pretty lips. And your cheekbones.

377
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,680
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, add a little curl.

378
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,756
What do you think?

379
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,438
Yeah!

380
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,997
Well?

381
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,359
- Well, what do you wanna know?
- Why Tommy asked her to the prom.

382
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,355
- Well?
- I asked him to.

383
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,150
Why?

384
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,032
Whatfor?

385
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,078
What could you have had in mind?

386
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,389
I thought it would be good for Carrie to
get her to join in and be with people...

387
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,795
- Make her a part ofthings?
- Right.

388
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,274
Come on, Sue. We're not that stupid.

389
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,193
- Neither is Carrie.
- Maybe not. I don't know.

390
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,557
You mean you're not gonna go?
Stay in and miss your own senior prom?

391
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,397
Come in.

392
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,398
- What is it?
- The attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

393
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,671
You know you can't go without a date.

394
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,670
- Is there anything else, Norma?
- No, Miss Collins.

395
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,394
- Which brings us to you.
- I have to get to practice.

396
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,670
Well, it's too bad, isn't it?

397
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,110
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and I.
- But I do mind.

398
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,995
Unless, of course, you'd like to continue
this little discussion in Mr Morton's office.

399
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,951
What is the big deal?!

400
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,756
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

401
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,668
- She already said no anyway.
- With a little effort you can change that.

402
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,519
- Don't count your chickens.
- Just don't try.

403
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,349
- Fine. I won't try.
- Wait a second! It's notfine!

404
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,479
You can't order him
not to take someone to the prom!

405
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,751
I <i>can</i> make sure you don't hurt
Carrie White any more.

406
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,316
We're not trying to hurt her.
We're trying to help her!

407
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,078
How?

408
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,793
Hey, Tommy, um... Don't you think
you'll look a little ridiculous...

409
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,391
...when you walk in with Carrie White?
- We don't care how we look.

410
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,756
Do we?

411
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,472
What?

412
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,919

- Hi.

415

- So this is where you live, huh?
- What are you doing here?

416
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,755
You gonna ask me in?

- Why not?
- <i>(</i>" <i>gospel music)</i>

- What do you want?
- God, right to the point, huh? Um...

420
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,112
- About the prom.
- I told you.

421
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,836
- But you can change your mind.
- Why are you doing this?

422
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,598
- Cos I want to.
- No, you're not.

423
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,678
- I don't do anything I don't want to.
- I can't.

424
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,473
- Yes, you can!
- <i>(mother)</i> Carrie!

- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

- I said I can't.
- Carrie!

428
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,718
Yes, you can.

00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,037
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.

430
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,116
Why is it so important to you?

431
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,750
I don't know.
Maybe because, um... you liked my poem.

432
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,438
Carrie!

433
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,429
- OK, OK, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.

434
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,112
OK.

wake up the little piggies? Oink, oink!

00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,836
You know, this is a hell of a risk for a joke.

438
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,838
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke.

- You bet it's a good joke.
- Look at this!

- What?
- All these pigs!

- What are you talkin' about?
- These painted pigs!

Stupid Old Man Henty's nitwit cousin
painted 'em all over the place.

I went out with the girl that posed for 'em.
She was a real pig!

- Will you shut up?!
- Will you let me up here?

Bye.

668
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,198
Don't let me catch you
huggin' any guys like that.

669
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,675
- I won't.
- Better not.

670
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,958
I won't.

671
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,953
Do you really have to be home so early?

672
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,957
Yeah, I promised.

673
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,158
OK.

674
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,714
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

Um...

676
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,278
Some ofthe kids are going
to Lewiston's after the prom.

677
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,356
- That's OK.
- What?

678
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,036
If you wanna go with your friends,
I don't wanna spoil anything.

679
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,152
Would you let me finish?
What I was gonna say...

680
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:30,196
...is that, if you'd like to, we could stop in
at the Beehive for a couple of minutes.

681
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,197
- I've never been there.
- No?

682
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,875
Good! Well, then, let's go!

683
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,596
- OK.
- OK? For sure.

684
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,195
Are you ready to dance?

685
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,992
- Come on.
- Tommy, I...

686
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,953
- Come on.
- I can't. I don't know how.

687
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,675

- Sure you can.

I saw him looking down at me that way.

815
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,276
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

816
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,713
I smelt the whisky on his breath.

817
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:10,032

roadhouse whisky on his breath.

...I should have given you to God
when you were born.

- Yes.
