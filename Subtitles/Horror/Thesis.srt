1
00:00:01,865 --> 00:00:03,915
Attention, ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:07,315
This train stops here due
to an accident

3
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:09,915
We're half way into the station

4
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:13,465
The doors will now be opened
to let you out

5
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:15,865
Please do as you're told

6
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,865
Ladies and gentlemen, let's go

7
00:00:17,865 --> 00:00:20,265
Through the carriages, to the platform

8
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:22,115
What's happened

9
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,115
A man threw himself under the train

10
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:28,215
Leave the platform as fast as you can

11
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:31,515
Don't look at the track

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,415
He's been cut in half

13
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:35,165
Right, let's go!

14
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:37,615
Move!

15
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:56,165
Out you go, keep to one line, please

16
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,865
Keep going, eyes off the track

17
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,115
There's nothing to see, keep moving

18
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,115
A man threw himself on the track...

19
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:09,365
No looking, please!.

20
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,415
Don't touch anything!

21
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,915
Move on, there's nothing to see

22
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,915
Keep moving, don't be so morbid

23
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,865
Keep going, go on! Move along!

24
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,765
School of Mass Communication

25
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:15,065
November, 1955

26
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:23,865
It's just an outline

27
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:25,665
Well, I like your approach

28
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:28,815
It's a very sensitive subject

29
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,165
And just what the ghouls will lap up

30
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:36,065
But you're treating it objectively

31
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,665
Thanks

32
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:41,865
See in you class

33
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,465
Just one more thing...

34
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:45,315
On section No. 7...

35
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,465
"Audiovisual Violence"

36
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,365
I need more material

37
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:55,865
What kind?

38
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:59,065
Footage never shown on TV
because of its violent nature

39
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,865
You have access to the library

40
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,215
You could get me interesting material

41
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:08,965
You find this stuff interesting?

42
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,115
Not personally, only for my project

43
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:15,565
- Violent footage...
- As violent as possible

44
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:20,015
It would a bit awkward asking
for films of such nature

45
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,565
They'd think I'm a freak

46
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:27,565
I can't promise anything

47
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,765
- Come back tomorrow
- Thanks

48
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:32,565
Right, see you next week

49
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:34,765
And keep going to the cinema

50
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,065
Are you Chema?

51
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:43,865
I'm Angela

52
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:44,615
Cool!

53
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:49,565
Listen, I hear you like violent films
and have quite a collection

54
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:51,765
Of what?

55
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,515
You know, gore, porn...

56
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,365
It's false and you can't have them
anyway

57
00:03:57,865 --> 00:04:00,265
Go to a sex shop if you want a turn-on

58
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,315
It's for my thesis:
Audiovisual Violence

59
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,165
Try Mickey Mouse

60
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,815
So you want to see the tapes?

61
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:46,865
So you do have them?

62
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:47,865
Yes or no?

63
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:54,365
You, students, like shooting off
your mouth about film-making

64
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,865
But you know zilch about movies

65
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,665
What do you know about it?

66
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,415
What I've got in here

67
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:05,015
You two-faced sods say my films are
crap, but you're all dying to see them

68
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:08,815
It's for my thesis...
I'm not interested in your -

69
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:14,865
Come on in

70
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,215
Do you want some?

71
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,865
No, thanks

72
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:10,115
Right to the point, then -
very well

73
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:13,715
Don't say I didn't warn you

74
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,665
Do you live with burglars?

75
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:22,965
I live alone

76
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,865
- No parents?
- They don't live in Madrid

77
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,565
This was my grandmother's.
She died last year

78
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,365
Don't touch anything

79
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:51,065
No one's allowed here.
You're lucky

80
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:53,715
Why me?

81
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:54,865
You're gorgeous

82
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,965
- Thanks
- You were born that way

83
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,915
Sit down, I don't charge for it

84
00:07:15,865 --> 00:07:17,565
What do you want to see?

85
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,265
What have you got?

86
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:26,215
All types of porn

87
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:30,165
Soft, hard, violent, Eastern,
you name it - all hot stuff

88
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:35,065
I'm not interested in this kind of porn,
if that's all you have to offer...

89
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:38,065
You want action, then?
Very well...

90
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:40,915
I need the really violent stuff

91
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:44,965
Really violent? How nice.
You'll get off on this then

92
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:48,865
What is it?

93
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,965
"Fresh Blood" - a very beautiful
and educational film

94
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:07,865
What are they doing?

95
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,165
What do you think?
Removing his brain

96
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,665
God...

97
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:14,615
That's what you wanted, so don't get
squeamish

98
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,065
It's all real:

99
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:19,615
executions, beatings, lynchings...
great stuff

100
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,865
- Hello...
- Hello, Mr Figueroa

101
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:25,115
I need a favour

102
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:29,265
I'm looking for a Czech film
but I don't remember the title

103
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,465
Can I check the tapes?

104
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:35,365
- You mean, in the storeroom?
- I know it's irregular, but...

105
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,115
Come with me...

106
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:45,665
You know, it's odd...
no one ever asks to go in

107
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:48,915
But you're the second one today

108
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:50,915
Is that so?

109
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,665
He came in a moment ago...

110
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:56,865
Professor?

111
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:00,865
He can't hear me

112
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:03,915
Right, it's arranged by genres.
I'll leave you to it

113
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:07,165
Shouldn't we wait for him to finish?

114
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,865
No, I don't think you'll bother him

115
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:12,615
- Unless it bothers you...
- No, of course not

116
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,265
It's so large, you won't bump into him

117
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:16,715
See you

118
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,765
"Pornography etc., Shelf 5H"

119
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,065
It's horrible!

120
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,865
Do people really watch such films?

121
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:04,115
You do, for one

122
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:07,115
That's different,
I don't enjoy them

123
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,065
It's loathsome

124
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,565
Ever seen anyone killed?

125
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:19,265
What do you think?

126
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,015
Not TV killing, real life killing

127
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:27,115
This is real.
What more do you want?

128
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,165
You don't get me

129
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,815
I've never seen anyone killed

130
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:38,015
Mr Figueroa, we have to close now

131
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,115
Well, that's it

132
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,865
- Hi, bookworm
- Have you seen Figueroa?

133
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,965
So you go for older men, do you?

134
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,215
Did you find him?

135
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:29,965
He didn't come to class, nor did you.
Where were you?

136
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,365
Never mind...
I'm off

137
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:37,565
Can a film kill someone?

138
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:44,365
A heart attack or something like that...

139
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,665
...caused by what they see

140
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:49,115
Not again! Wasn't yesterday enough?

141
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,015
You're a real sadist, aren't you?

142
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,265
If so, you'd even fuck a freak like me

143
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:02,065
I've got money

144
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:03,965
We're off...

145
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,165
- Sena?
- Coming!

146
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:09,365
Sure you won't come?

147
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:11,765
No, I must work on my thesis

148
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,215
Then you'll want to borrow
my clothes!

149
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,465
Don't work too hard...

150
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:51,865
- Mum?
- What?

151
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:54,065
- What's on this tape?
- What tape?

152
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,315
In the VCR. Did you watch it
last night?

153
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,065
See what it is

154
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:04,865
- It's mine
- Can't I watch it?

155
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:09,215
- It's for my thesis... it'll bore you!
- How do you know?

156
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:13,915
I bet it's not just a reportage

157
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,765
Silence!

158
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,215
Please quiet down

159
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,065
Hello everyone

160
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:32,265
I suppose you've all heard
the sad news

161
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,865
Prof. Figueroa died on Tuesday

162
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,865
He was found in the screening room

163
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:42,115
Apparently he had an asthma attack
while watching a film

164
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,715
I bet it was a Spanish film

165
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:46,215
You saw the film?

166
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,165
Did you take it?

167
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,215
My name is Castro

168
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:55,865
Jorge Castro

169
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:59,415
I'm a professor of Audiovisual
Psychology, as some of you know

170
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,865
I'll be replacing Prof. Figueroa
for the time being

171
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:06,065
I know the programme quite well...

172
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:09,565
...so we should be able to carry on
as normal

173
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:13,315
Which reminds me...

174
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,115
Angela Marquez?

175
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:23,665
I believe Prof. Figueroa supervised
your thesis

176
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,665
I'd be happy to take it on

177
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:30,115
We can discuss it whenever you like

178
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:33,865
You're losing it

179
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:36,565
I'm not. You found him dead
and took the tape

180
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:37,815
I didn't!

181
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,865
She did it! She took the tape!

182
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:44,215
- Why should I show it to you?
- Because I showed you mine

183
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,865
- Why do you want it?
- Why do you?

184
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:50,215
- It's for my thesis...
- Bullshit! What the fuck's on it?

185
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:53,865
I don't know

186
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:54,615
What?

187
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:57,415
I haven't seen it yet

188
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,465
You're stupid or what?

189
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,315
Your place or mine?

190
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,165
Give me the tape

191
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:18,215
Let the fun begin

192
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:29,765
I can't!

193
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:31,815
Your loss

194
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,065
Switch it off!

195
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,865
It's real!

196
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,615
What?

197
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:47,615
A girl, tied to a chair, being beaten
by a guy wearing a balaclava

198
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,815
Why are you doing this to me?

199
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,515
Shit, this is horrible!

200
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:56,865
I can't...

201
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:00,815
What's he going to do to her?

202
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:02,965
Don't watch!

203
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:04,865
I don't want to

204
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:05,915
Don't look!

205
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:08,915
Don't look!

206
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:26,865
I know her

207
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,615
She was at the university

208
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:31,815
She disappeared two years ago

209
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:07,965
Is she dead?

210
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:11,115
What else? They blew her brains out

211
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,565
What are they doing now?

212
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:18,865
- Cutting her up
- Jesus!

213
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,065
Switch it off!

214
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:28,015
I knew it!
The bastard's a butcher

215
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:42,365
Her name was Vanessa

216
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,665
Why did they do it to her?

217
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:51,115
It looks like a garage, doesn't it?

218
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,265
Yes, it's a garage

219
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:57,865
- It is a garage!
- So what?

220
00:22:57,865 --> 00:23:00,615
- She was tortured and killed
- You don't say!

221
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:03,815
How can you watch this filth?

222
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:06,865
- You stole that filth!
- I didn't know what it was

223
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,715
No, but you had an idea...
deep down you like it

224
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:13,015
- What did you say?
- You heard me

225
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,415
That's really stupid!

226
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:18,765
- Wait, what the hell's this?
- I'm not watching!

227
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,665
I'm talking of the texture

228
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,515
The horizontal lines...

229
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:31,865
I only see intestines...

230
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:34,865
You've learnt nothing in 5 years.
The texture's different

231
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:35,515
So?

232
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,365
It's a digital zoom!

233
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,765
The bugger used digital zoom

234
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:42,765
So what?

235
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:44,865
We can find the camera he used

236
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:47,815
How many cameras have
digital zoom? 5000? 10,000?

237
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:51,065
How many were there two years ago?

238
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:53,765
Not many

239
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,765
Very few

240
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:01,915
Autofocus, light control,
stabilizer, stereo mike...

241
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:02,865
Shit!

242
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:06,115
Here: "Digital zoom - the centre
of the picture gets..."

243
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:10,115
B-2000 - it only came out this year

244
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:11,965
Let's see...

245
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:15,165
Stroboscopic effect,
solar effects...

246
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,615
I'm sure that was the one

247
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:18,915
The XT-500?

248
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,715
Fuck, that's it! The XT-500

249
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,365
Here it is, I'm sure

250
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,315
Autofocus, audio dubbing...
digital zoom

251
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,515
"This feature offers...

252
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,865
"...a significant enlargement of the
original." There you go...

253
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,165
He used a XT-500

254
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,715
- It's the Hl-8 system, I think
- Fascinating...

255
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:43,815
- Well, I'm going home for dinner
- You're hungry?

256
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:45,865
No, scared

257
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,465
Don't take it with you

258
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:51,465
I want to see it again

259
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:22,065
Her parents haven't heard from her

260
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:24,115
Sena, come here

261
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,515
Did you search my room?

262
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:29,265
Why? Of course not

263
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:31,815
I hate people snooping around

264
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:31,865
It wasn't me

265
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,115
Well, someone's been looking around

266
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:36,965
It wasn't me

267
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:40,965
You were after that tape, right?

268
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:43,065
Leave me alone

269
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:56,865
It's Chema. I've got something

270
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,715
I'm not interested, got it?

271
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:01,065
- Someone's been in my room
- What?

272
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:03,365
Calm down, will you?

273
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,515
- No one knows, don't panic!
- Of course not

274
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,115
You'd better check your room
as well

275
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:12,865
No one's been in here

276
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,815
But I must show you something

277
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,715
- I can't...
- Yes, you can!

278
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,965
- I don't want to!
- Yes, you do!

279
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:23,015
It didn't seem important at first

280
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:27,765
No, please, don't... please!

281
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:29,865
"Please..."

282
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:30,965
" Please..."

283
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:33,665
There!

284
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:34,615
What?

285
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:35,865
It's a cut

286
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:36,865
Look again

287
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:43,765
No, please, don't... please!

288
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,815
Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:48,865
It's been edited

290
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:50,965
Not just here, it's full of cuts

291
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:54,215
All done in the same way -
very subtle

292
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,865
He's almost in the same position

293
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:00,115
So why the cut?

294
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:03,615
You want to see everything in films
like these

295
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:05,765
The more you see, the better

296
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:07,065
So why cut it?

297
00:27:07,865 --> 00:27:09,615
So we won't see something

298
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,165
Why me? Please -

299
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:18,865
She was going to say something

300
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:19,615
What?

301
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:22,165
Something he doesn't want us to hear

302
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:26,765
His name

303
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:29,915
- She knew who he was
- So what?

304
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,015
So now we know something
about him

305
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:36,615
You sound like the police

306
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,365
Hey, don't insult me

307
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:43,015
We must find who were her friends

308
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:44,865
He might be one of them

309
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:45,715
Look...

310
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:52,515
I've had enough of this

311
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:53,865
You're scared

312
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,865
Of course I am, this isn't a game.
It's real killing

313
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:59,215
Piss off, then.
I'll do this on my own

314
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:02,165
You don't get it - I said it's over!

315
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:03,865
For you as well

316
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:04,865
I don't want any trouble

317
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:07,965
- I won't get you into trouble
- So what will you do?

318
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:10,865
Go after anyone with a camera
like that?

319
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:12,865
And if you find him?
Or he finds you?

320
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:14,215
That's my problem

321
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,115
Too right it is

322
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:22,715
I've never been here, I don't know you
and I've never seen that tape

323
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,115
What is cinema?

324
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:37,015
Cinema is an industry, it's money

325
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:42,715
It's millions invested in films
and then retrieved at the box office

326
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:46,865
We have no cinema because it's not
seen as industry

327
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:51,315
There's no communication between
the makers and their public

328
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,865
We've reached a critical stage

329
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,965
Spanish cinema can only be saved
if it's accepted as an industrial factor

330
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:03,315
You, as students of cinema,
are the future of Spanish cinema

331
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:04,765
Save it!

332
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,565
The American industry...

333
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:10,215
...is strangling you and there's only
one way to fight it:

334
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:12,815
Give the public what it wants

335
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,215
Don't forget that

336
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:31,065
Angela, right?

337
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:32,865
How do you do...

338
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,465
- A drink?
- No, thanks

339
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:36,865
Here's my project

340
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:39,165
Don't be so formal, I'm not that old

341
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,565
I've neglected it lately

342
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,265
Never mind, I just want to get an idea

343
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,815
Anything else I need to know?

344
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:50,815
Excellent

345
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:13,915
"University Student Disappears"

346
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:19,515
"Where is Our Daughter?

347
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,865
"Court Blocks New lnquiry
in Vanessa Romero's Case"

348
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:47,315
That's all for today...
see you tomorrow

349
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:51,065
Don't forget to bring in your work

350
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:10,865
What do you want?

351
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:12,515
What do you want of me?

352
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:18,065
This is yours!

353
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:34,865
Are you doing Journalism?

354
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:36,215
No, cinema and TV

355
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:39,115
- One of us?
- Give it to me, please

356
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,865
Is this a project you're working on?

357
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:43,915
No... well, yes, it's a project

358
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:47,715
- You're in luck then
- Why?

359
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:49,865
I knew her

360
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:53,865
A friend of my girl. I know what
happened

361
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:56,565
That's alright, thanks...
I've got all I need

362
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,915
There are things you don't know

363
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,115
Where were you?

364
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:05,315
Yolanda, this is...

365
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:08,665
Angela

366
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,965
She's doing a project on Vanessa

367
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,265
Can I have a word?

368
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:40,065
Hi, roadrunner

369
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:44,565
Is it really a project
or are you kidding me?

370
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,015
No, it's true

371
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,115
And the camera?

372
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:51,715
Camera?

373
00:37:51,865 --> 00:37:53,165
For the project?

374
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:56,015
Oh, of course

375
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:59,365
- Well, the truth is...
- You're confused

376
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:00,615
What?

377
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:03,465
No, the thing is...
we still haven't got it

378
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,865
We've got to get authorization

379
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:07,015
Will this do?

380
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:10,815
I've had enough!
It's bullshit

381
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:13,865
You've got to help me!

382
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,215
To interview him?

383
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:16,965
He pushed me

384
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:18,915
Pushed you?

385
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,715
What does one ask a killer?

386
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:24,665
Was Vanessa a normal girl?

387
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:28,365
I'm glad you asked: she was
a wonderful girl, full of life...

388
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,965
...until I killed her, of course

389
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:33,815
Did she mix with wierd types?

390
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:35,315
No, she was a saint

391
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:38,715
Did Vanessa seem odd prior
to her disappearance?

392
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:39,865
What do I know?

393
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,915
- Do you think she was killed?
- You can't ask that!

394
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:46,865
- It's fundamental
- You'll fuck up if you ask that

395
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:48,865
If I don't, he'll think I'm avoiding
the issue

396
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:51,915
Who care what he might think.
This isn't your thesis

397
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:00,865
What is it?

398
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:01,865
I'm leaving

399
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:02,565
Why?

400
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:03,715
Because

401
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:04,615
Great

402
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:10,865
Alright, I'm sorry

403
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,265
Where are my keys?

404
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,315
So what's his name?

405
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:18,265
Where are my keys?

406
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:22,215
- What's this?
- These are my sister's

407
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:25,515
- I never lose my keys
- Welcome to the club

408
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:37,915
This is Bosco and this is Chema

409
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:42,865
How's it going?

410
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:45,565
- Is that the camera?
- Chema's the cameraman

411
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:48,165
- You know how it works?
- I think so

412
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:53,865
When you're ready

413
00:39:53,865 --> 00:39:55,865
Bosco was in class with Vanessa

414
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:57,865
Can you tell us what happened?

415
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:01,865
Well, Vanessa didn't come to class
for several days

416
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:05,665
When we phoned her,
they said she's disappeared

417
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:09,815
The police looked for her for months
but we never heard from her again

418
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:12,765
You think she was kidnapped?

419
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:15,765
Some say so, but it's absurd

420
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:19,415
She sent one letter in which she
wrote....

421
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:23,215
...that she was in love with some guy
and ran off with him

422
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:25,665
There was no ransom demand

423
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:29,965
Didn't you think it strange that you
knew nothing about her private life?

424
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:32,915
I don't spy on people...
do you?

425
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,015
Any idea who she'd run away with?

426
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:40,715
No, but knowing Vanessa,
it had to be someone...

427
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,115
...very special

428
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:45,765
- In what way?
- In every way

429
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:50,865
Vanessa...

430
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:55,865
Two years have gone by and I'm sure
you've made a new life for yourself

431
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:59,515
But wherever you are...

432
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:01,965
...your friends won't forget you

433
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:05,265
Please, Vanessa...

434
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:07,415
Come back, I love you

435
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:10,865
- He was crying...
- Bullshit!

436
00:41:10,865 --> 00:41:13,365
- Suppose he's honest
- Don't fall for it

437
00:41:14,865 --> 00:41:17,865
You look at his angelic face
and believe every word he says

438
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:19,865
- Do you fancy him?
- Don't be silly

439
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:21,265
Don't you be silly

440
00:41:21,865 --> 00:41:22,865
But that letter...

441
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:25,215
The letter just says she fell in love

442
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:27,865
- Who with?
- Who do you think?

443
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:30,865
How can you so sure?
And besides...

444
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,315
...Bosco has a girl

445
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:37,515
Get this into your head

446
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:41,415
Apart from being a stuck-up
little turd, he is a psychopath...

447
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:43,165
That's all he is

448
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:45,865
Can't you see how he looks at you?

449
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:48,865
He's dying to blow your brains out
while he buggers you

450
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:50,865
- He's mad!
- Sounds like you know him

451
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:54,365
Right, go for him. He'll come round
with a camera and a knife

452
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,515
- So what now?
- Nothing

453
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:03,565
Why?

454
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:06,115
We know who he is,
now let's go home

455
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:08,865
We must tell the police

456
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:11,065
Like hell we do! Not me, anyway...

457
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:15,565
We've no proof. We don't even know
where the old man got the tape

458
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:16,865
From the library

459
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:17,665
No way

460
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:31,965
Anyone home?

461
00:43:25,865 --> 00:43:28,215
A friend of your's here.
He's gorgeous

462
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:32,115
Is Angela home?

463
00:43:32,865 --> 00:43:34,765
- She is, come on in
- Thanks

464
00:43:41,865 --> 00:43:43,665
A bit on edge, aren't you?

465
00:43:44,865 --> 00:43:46,465
You know where I live?

466
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:49,665
I do my own investigations

467
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,365
So what do you want?

468
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,715
I brought you the interview

469
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:06,765
Thank you, there was no need

470
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:10,865
That's not why I came

471
00:44:10,865 --> 00:44:11,815
Why then?

472
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,315
I want to shoot you

473
00:44:13,865 --> 00:44:14,615
What?

474
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:17,365
There are no shots of you
interviewing me

475
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,765
We need them for the editing

476
00:44:21,865 --> 00:44:23,065
Sure, I forgot

477
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:26,565
Right, when you're ready

478
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:27,865
Here?

479
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,565
It's in close-up.
You can't tell where we are

480
00:44:31,865 --> 00:44:32,865
You'll see

481
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:34,265
Where's your room?

482
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,565
I don't like being taped

483
00:44:42,865 --> 00:44:44,365
I don't believe that

484
00:44:46,865 --> 00:44:48,515
A pretty girl like you?

485
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:53,915
Don't worry, it won't take long

486
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,415
Had this camera long?

487
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,415
Around... four months

488
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,765
It's no longer on the market

489
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:06,715
God, you do know everything

490
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:08,865
I got it second-hand

491
00:45:08,865 --> 00:45:10,115
Why do you ask?

492
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:12,215
No special reason

493
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:16,215
You like asking questions, don't you?

494
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:18,265
Can I ask you one?

495
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:20,765
Go ahead

496
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:26,565
What colour are my eyes?

497
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:31,265
I don't know...
I haven't really looked

498
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:34,015
I see... so you're a liar as well

499
00:45:38,865 --> 00:45:39,865
How much longer?

500
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,265
You're in a hurry?

501
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:42,865
It's almost lunch

502
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,815
You'll stay for lunch, Bosco?

503
00:45:46,865 --> 00:45:47,715
Love to

504
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:49,865
Great, I'm nipping out for a few things

505
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:50,715
Be good

506
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:02,315
What are you doing?

507
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:05,665
The light's bad for this camera.
Sit on the bed

508
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:07,565
Why?

509
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,815
I can't get a good focus from here.
Sit on the bed

510
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:21,815
That's it

511
00:46:22,865 --> 00:46:24,265
Ready when you are

512
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:28,765
We're talking to Bosco,
a classmate of Vanessa...

513
00:46:28,865 --> 00:46:31,065
...who was close to her prior to -

514
00:46:33,865 --> 00:46:35,365
Aren't you checking?

515
00:46:36,865 --> 00:46:38,465
It's one straight shot

516
00:46:38,865 --> 00:46:41,165
Look at me when you ask
the questions

517
00:46:43,865 --> 00:46:47,365
Did she mix with wierd types?
Do you think she was kidnapped?

518
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:49,915
Any idea who she ran away with?

519
00:46:50,865 --> 00:46:51,815
That's it

520
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:52,715
Hang on

521
00:46:52,865 --> 00:46:55,515
You need some nods as reaction
to my answers

522
00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:58,015
For intercuts

523
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:12,715
Wait...

524
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:13,615
What?

525
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:18,565
- We were closer yesterday
- I don't think so

526
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:21,315
Does it bother you?

527
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:25,965
Say when it starts bothering you

528
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:29,665
Don't!

529
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:38,115
Every word brings me an inch closer

530
00:47:39,865 --> 00:47:41,065
It's not funny

531
00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:42,915
Don't speak

532
00:47:49,865 --> 00:47:50,765
Nervous?

533
00:47:51,865 --> 00:47:53,765
- Of course not
- Not a word!

534
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:01,265
The mouth can kill

535
00:48:03,865 --> 00:48:04,865
I'm not going to die

536
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,465
"I'm-not-going-to-die"

537
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:09,915
Five inches

538
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:18,565
What colour are my eyes?

539
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,615
Are you going to kill me?

540
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:29,915
Six more inches for saying that

541
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,415
Just one more word...

542
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:40,215
...and we collide

543
00:48:45,865 --> 00:48:47,615
I thought you wanted this

544
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:51,865
Next time I'll punch your face

545
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:54,665
There won't be a next time

546
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:58,215
Angela, don't let Bosco set the table

547
00:49:03,865 --> 00:49:06,865
- Who switched channels?
- I did, the news is boring

548
00:49:06,865 --> 00:49:09,265
How would you know?
Where's the remote?

549
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,815
So you work as well as study?

550
00:49:12,865 --> 00:49:14,215
I do some filming

551
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:16,865
What kind?

552
00:49:19,865 --> 00:49:21,715
Whatever I get: weddings...

553
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:23,715
- Baptisms...
- Does it pay?

554
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:24,665
Enough

555
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:26,815
Angela never does such things

556
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:28,765
She works hard on her thesis

557
00:49:31,865 --> 00:49:33,615
You're doing your thesis?

558
00:49:33,865 --> 00:49:35,215
I've just started

559
00:49:35,865 --> 00:49:36,765
On what?

560
00:49:36,865 --> 00:49:37,865
I'm not sure yet

561
00:49:37,865 --> 00:49:40,115
Audiovisual violence and the family

562
00:49:40,865 --> 00:49:42,415
You're into violence?

563
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:43,865
Not really

564
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:47,715
She loves it. She's warped. She
spends hours analysing violent films

565
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:49,865
Shut up, Sena

566
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:50,865
Is this project part of your thesis?

567
00:49:50,865 --> 00:49:51,765
No, why?

568
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,865
The last film she brought home
was really something

569
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:56,865
You're doing a project?

570
00:49:56,865 --> 00:49:57,865
What is it about?

571
00:49:57,865 --> 00:50:00,015
Shall we eat? We've talked enough

572
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,265
What do you study?

573
00:50:03,865 --> 00:50:05,865
- I started law this year
- Law?

574
00:50:05,865 --> 00:50:08,215
What do you know...
I wanted to do law

575
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:11,665
Really? So why didn't you?

576
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:14,065
Don't know, I'm not cut out for it

577
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:16,565
You've got to be very...

578
00:50:16,865 --> 00:50:19,265
Very tenacious... and very intelligent

579
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:23,315
- I'm neither and I'm studying it
- Your meat's getting cold

580
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:24,915
You look it

581
00:50:26,865 --> 00:50:27,615
What?

582
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:29,065
lntelligent...

583
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:33,065
How's Yolanda?

584
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,065
Who's Yolanda?

585
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:39,065
His girlfriend

586
00:50:39,865 --> 00:50:41,115
We've broken up

587
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:43,715
Really?

588
00:50:44,865 --> 00:50:47,165
More or less...
the meat is excellent

589
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,165
He's been to your house?
Bloody hell!

590
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:00,865
Why did you let him in?

591
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:02,865
I can't help it, he charmed my family

592
00:51:02,865 --> 00:51:06,865
It's you he's charmed. With me, not
even coffee, but him you invite home!

593
00:51:06,865 --> 00:51:07,865
Stop being silly!

594
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,615
He says he bought it 4 months ago,
second-hand

595
00:51:11,865 --> 00:51:13,865
That snotty sod using second-hand?

596
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:16,865
He bought it new, with guarantee.
He's got you again

597
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,865
We can check

598
00:51:17,865 --> 00:51:19,765
You either believe him or me

599
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:21,115
That's rubbish!

600
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:43,815
Look, I've lost the receipt and the
shop doesn't have it either but...

601
00:51:43,865 --> 00:51:45,865
- They said you'd have it
- What was it?

602
00:51:45,865 --> 00:51:47,115
A XT-500 camera

603
00:51:48,865 --> 00:51:50,665
You must have bought it...

604
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:51,865
Two years ago

605
00:51:51,865 --> 00:51:53,515
The guarantee's expired

606
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:56,315
I know, but I need to keep the receipts

607
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:57,865
Alright...

608
00:52:02,865 --> 00:52:03,765
1993...

609
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,665
- You live in Madrid?
- Yes

610
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,865
Your name?

611
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:19,015
It's my brother's - Bosco Herranz

612
00:52:23,865 --> 00:52:25,365
He must come himself

613
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:28,865
They said it's not necessary
on the phone

614
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:30,015
Who told you?

615
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:33,265
Some girl, I think

616
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:35,265
One moment, please

617
00:52:58,865 --> 00:52:59,915
"Customer:"

618
00:53:03,865 --> 00:53:05,265
"Customer unknown"

619
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:08,715
"ltem:"

620
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:00,865
I knew it!

621
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:07,415
Freddy Kruger himself

622
00:55:07,865 --> 00:55:08,865
Haven't seen you for a while

623
00:55:08,865 --> 00:55:09,865
I've been busy

624
00:55:09,865 --> 00:55:11,815
- Jerking off?
- Less than you

625
00:55:12,865 --> 00:55:15,315
Can I look at the closed-circuit tapes?

626
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:18,765
You want me to get the sack?

627
00:55:18,865 --> 00:55:20,465
The 12th, the library

628
00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:21,815
Slow down

629
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,065
What do I get?

630
00:55:24,865 --> 00:55:25,715
My body

631
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:26,865
No, thanks

632
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:35,115
High-class porn

633
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:42,315
How did you get in?

634
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,215
What do you want?

635
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:52,115
Don't you know?

636
00:57:55,865 --> 00:57:56,915
To kill you

637
00:59:23,865 --> 00:59:24,815
The phone

638
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,415
Someone called Castro

639
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:38,415
- I hope I didn't wake you up
- Not at all

640
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:40,915
I'd like to discuss your thesis

641
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:50,015
How about 11 today, in my office

642
00:59:50,865 --> 00:59:52,165
- Fine...
- Great

643
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:54,515
I'll see you later then

644
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:19,165
Is Angela there?

645
01:00:20,865 --> 01:00:22,015
No, she's out

646
01:01:10,865 --> 01:01:11,715
Come in

647
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:14,515
- How are you?
- Fine...

648
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:16,915
Have a seat

649
01:01:22,865 --> 01:01:23,865
Cigarette?

650
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:25,415
I don't smoke, thanks

651
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:27,315
Right, let's see...

652
01:01:29,865 --> 01:01:31,465
It's somewhere here...

653
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:33,965
I'm hopeless

654
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:35,865
Here it is

655
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:40,965
Let's see...

656
01:02:03,865 --> 01:02:06,115
Why are you interested in violence?

657
01:02:07,865 --> 01:02:11,865
We get so much of it in films, on TV,
that we're getting too used to it

658
01:02:13,865 --> 01:02:14,515
So?

659
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:16,015
I'm concerned

660
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:17,565
Why?

661
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:19,815
Because I don't like violence

662
01:02:20,865 --> 01:02:22,065
You reject it?

663
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:23,815
Of course

664
01:02:24,865 --> 01:02:25,715
Always?

665
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:32,815
Yet violence is something
that is innate in us all

666
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:36,665
We can't censor every film

667
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:41,515
But the director must be aware
of its impact

668
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:45,315
The director's only duty is to give
the public what it wants

669
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:48,665
That's the basic principle of all
entertainment

670
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:51,765
Do you reject show-business?

671
01:02:53,865 --> 01:02:56,315
- No, but...
- It's a very complex issue

672
01:02:57,865 --> 01:02:59,065
For example...

673
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:01,715
On what type of violence...

674
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:03,265
...will you focus?

675
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:05,865
How do you mean?

676
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,415
Any particular genre?

677
01:03:09,865 --> 01:03:12,965
I got the impression -
and correct me if I'm wrong...

678
01:03:13,865 --> 01:03:16,265
I find that your approach is rather...

679
01:03:16,865 --> 01:03:18,315
- Superficial?
- Yes

680
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,565
You should get in deeper

681
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:23,865
This is meant to be a research project

682
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:26,165
These are just notes, it's not final

683
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:29,565
So you're investigating?

684
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:31,865
lnvestigating what?

685
01:03:31,865 --> 01:03:34,265
I don't know...
it's for you to tell me

686
01:03:35,865 --> 01:03:36,865
Tell you what?

687
01:03:36,865 --> 01:03:38,615
What you're investigating

688
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:40,715
I didn't say I was, you did

689
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:44,715
Alright

690
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:47,415
Since you seem reluctant
to collaborate...

691
01:03:50,865 --> 01:03:52,065
I don't get it

692
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,265
I'll tell you... try a different angle

693
01:04:00,865 --> 01:04:02,415
What killed Figueroa?

694
01:04:04,865 --> 01:04:05,915
Why ask me?

695
01:04:06,865 --> 01:04:09,965
He was your supervisor.
You must know what killed him

696
01:04:10,865 --> 01:04:12,965
You said it was an asthma attack

697
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:15,165
He was quite old

698
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:18,865
What was in the screening room...

699
01:04:18,865 --> 01:04:21,565
What was it he saw that could
have killed him

700
01:04:23,865 --> 01:04:24,815
Any idea?

701
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,865
You like theories...
don't you have one?

702
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:30,915
No, I don't

703
01:04:34,865 --> 01:04:35,865
Look, Angela...

704
01:04:35,865 --> 01:04:38,065
I think you're an intelligent girl

705
01:04:38,865 --> 01:04:40,465
I'm sure you'll go far

706
01:04:42,865 --> 01:04:44,865
That's why I don't understand you...

707
01:04:44,865 --> 01:04:46,465
I don't understand you

708
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:48,715
Really?

709
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:50,565
You don't understand me?

710
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:53,865
I think you do

711
01:04:53,865 --> 01:04:56,815
Think whatever you like.
I think I've heard enough

712
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:00,315
You know something?

713
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:02,815
So have l

714
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,865
I hate such situations.
It's humiliating to be caught lying...

715
01:05:38,865 --> 01:05:40,415
Like this, especially

716
01:05:41,865 --> 01:05:43,165
Don't you agree?

717
01:05:44,865 --> 01:05:45,865
It makes you wonder:

718
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:47,265
why do people lie?

719
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,265
Why are you lying?

720
01:05:59,865 --> 01:06:01,315
What's on that tape

721
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:06,465
You've lost your voice

722
01:06:07,865 --> 01:06:08,865
Very well...

723
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:11,315
I want that tape in my office, tomorrow

724
01:06:11,865 --> 01:06:12,715
Agreed?

725
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:14,915
Now tell me

726
01:06:15,865 --> 01:06:17,365
Why did you take it?

727
01:06:21,865 --> 01:06:23,865
- Is Angela there?
- No, who is it?

728
01:06:23,865 --> 01:06:24,865
Where is she?

729
01:06:24,865 --> 01:06:27,165
She had a meeting with some
professor

730
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:29,565
Who?

731
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:33,065
Angela, I can't supervise a student
who steals, lies...

732
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,515
...and, worst of all...

733
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:39,715
...who doesn't trust me. So, for
the last time, why did you take it?

734
01:06:39,865 --> 01:06:40,865
I don't know

735
01:06:40,865 --> 01:06:41,865
- Where did you get it?
- I don't know

736
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:43,015
Was it yours?

737
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:45,315
You wanted it back?

738
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:46,865
- So why take it?
- I don't know

739
01:06:46,865 --> 01:06:48,615
I'm getting tired of this

740
01:06:49,865 --> 01:06:53,865
No professor here will take up your
thesis if you're not straight with them

741
01:06:53,865 --> 01:06:56,115
It has nothing to do with my thesis

742
01:07:00,865 --> 01:07:02,415
It's far more serious

743
01:07:06,865 --> 01:07:07,965
I'm all ears

744
01:07:12,865 --> 01:07:14,465
No one else knows this

745
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:22,615
What?

746
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:25,965
It's for you

747
01:07:28,865 --> 01:07:30,415
You can take in there

748
01:07:44,865 --> 01:07:47,565
Angela, it's Chema.
What are you doing there?

749
01:07:55,865 --> 01:07:58,865
- Get out, now! That guy's in it
- How do you know?

750
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:01,665
- He knows about the tape?
- He knows I took it

751
01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:04,165
So he knows everything.
He'll want it

752
01:08:04,865 --> 01:08:06,815
Find some excuse and get out!

753
01:08:29,865 --> 01:08:31,765
- I've got to go...
- Do you?

754
01:08:32,865 --> 01:08:34,115
I'll see you...

755
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:36,465
Shouldn't we finish...

756
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,865
- It's my thesis, my degree?
- It's your life!

757
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:56,165
- I tried to get you all day yesterday
- I called you too

758
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:58,865
- He'll be after me now
- He's one of them

759
01:08:58,865 --> 01:09:01,615
- I thought it was just Bosco
- You were wrong

760
01:09:02,865 --> 01:09:05,865
- How many are there?
- No idea, but Castro is one of them

761
01:09:05,865 --> 01:09:07,865
- How do you know?
- How did he know you had the tape?

762
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:10,615
Because he saw me
on the closed-circuit camera

763
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:15,015
Yes, and another camera taped him

764
01:09:18,865 --> 01:09:20,665
- That's Figueroa
- Wait...

765
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:30,865
Where was he?

766
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:32,215
Around the corner

767
01:09:32,865 --> 01:09:35,465
He found out everything,
including the tape

768
01:09:36,865 --> 01:09:37,865
What's in that corner?

769
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:40,715
An underground store-room
where they hide things

770
01:09:41,865 --> 01:09:42,865
What things?

771
01:09:42,865 --> 01:09:44,115
I've taken some

772
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:46,865
Vanessa wasn't the only victim

773
01:09:56,865 --> 01:09:59,615
It's not an isolated incident.
It's a business

774
01:10:00,865 --> 01:10:03,265
Torture, murders...
It's all down there

775
01:10:05,865 --> 01:10:07,815
The cameras must be there too

776
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:08,865
What cameras?

777
01:10:08,865 --> 01:10:12,315
13 XT-500, bought by the faculty
two years ago, for practice

778
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:14,665
Do you know what it means?

779
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:17,115
To begin with, Bosco's not involved

780
01:10:17,865 --> 01:10:19,815
Again? Why do you defend him?

781
01:10:19,865 --> 01:10:23,065
There are 13 cameras.
Any student could have filmed it

782
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:26,665
- No student made this film!
- How do you know?

783
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:29,565
Because I -
I did projects with those cameras

784
01:10:31,865 --> 01:10:32,615
What?

785
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:34,615
Before they were scrapped

786
01:10:34,865 --> 01:10:35,865
Why didn't you tell me?

787
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:36,865
I'm telling you now

788
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:38,765
It's nothing to do with this

789
01:10:38,865 --> 01:10:41,665
Those cameras are just gathering
dust somewhere

790
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:43,865
They're gone. Nobody knows
where they are

791
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:44,615
Great

792
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:47,865
- They must be down there
- There are only tapes

793
01:10:47,865 --> 01:10:50,815
- We must find them
- I was there, there's nothing

794
01:10:50,865 --> 01:10:51,865
- Tonight, Chema!
- Shit, no!

795
01:10:51,865 --> 01:10:53,515
Listen to me, just once

796
01:10:54,865 --> 01:10:56,515
You're doing it for him

797
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:02,865
You're in love with him, idiot

798
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:05,115
Tonight, idiot!

799
01:11:20,865 --> 01:11:21,865
What do you want?

800
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,065
To talk to you

801
01:11:23,865 --> 01:11:24,665
About?

802
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:29,265
Vanessa was killed

803
01:11:31,865 --> 01:11:33,865
We all had nothing but lectures...

804
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:37,265
...so Vanessa and I joined a directors'
workshop, Bosco too

805
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:40,015
We did some practice with cameras

806
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:43,565
- What type?
- I don't know, I don't remember

807
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,465
One guy took the whole thing
very seriously

808
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:50,115
He was always telling us what to do

809
01:11:51,865 --> 01:11:54,515
Then Bosco and that other guy
became friends

810
01:11:54,865 --> 01:11:56,815
They started working together

811
01:11:56,865 --> 01:11:59,115
They asked one girl to act for them

812
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:02,215
She had to take off her clothes
and...

813
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:04,515
Well, I left them to it

814
01:12:04,865 --> 01:12:05,565
Why?

815
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:07,965
It was awful

816
01:12:08,865 --> 01:12:10,915
And the professor said nothing?

817
01:12:13,865 --> 01:12:15,715
- Who was it?
- Jorge Castro

818
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,165
Do you know him?

819
01:12:18,865 --> 01:12:19,965
It got worse

820
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:22,865
Towards the end of the year...

821
01:12:22,865 --> 01:12:26,415
...Bosco's friend told us about Snuff.
Do you know what it is?

822
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:32,665
They choose some person...

823
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:36,465
...kidnap, torture, kill them
and record it all on tape or film

824
01:12:36,865 --> 01:12:39,065
No editing, no effects, no make-up

825
01:12:39,865 --> 01:12:41,565
All in one sequence shot

826
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:43,965
That guy was obsessed with Snuff

827
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:46,715
Vanessa and I got scared...

828
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:50,465
He said it was very easy
to make such stuff

829
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:53,915
I told Bosco we should pull out

830
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:55,565
And?

831
01:12:55,865 --> 01:12:58,715
They stopped seeing each other.
I don't know why

832
01:12:59,865 --> 01:13:01,315
The workshop closed

833
01:13:03,865 --> 01:13:05,865
And a week later,
Vanessa disappeared

834
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:07,865
They said she ran away from home

835
01:13:07,865 --> 01:13:09,465
But she'd have told me

836
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,765
I'm sure that guy killed her

837
01:13:12,865 --> 01:13:14,715
He used her in a snuff film

838
01:13:14,865 --> 01:13:16,115
And the letter?

839
01:13:16,865 --> 01:13:20,865
They sent it after she disappeared.
She was probably forced to write it

840
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,015
And that guy?

841
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:28,815
Your friend, with the glasses

842
01:13:28,865 --> 01:13:30,465
I've seen you with him

843
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,915
There are more.
Do you watch TV?

844
01:13:33,865 --> 01:13:35,615
More cases like Vanessa's

845
01:13:35,865 --> 01:13:37,515
Five girls in two years

846
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:39,515
"The police suspects...

847
01:13:39,865 --> 01:13:42,765
"...a video Snuff network."
No other clear motive

848
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:43,815
No bodies

849
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,365
Have you told Bosco?

850
01:13:48,865 --> 01:13:50,465
We hardly talk nowaday

851
01:13:50,865 --> 01:13:52,765
Besides, he won't believe me

852
01:13:54,865 --> 01:13:56,365
Chema wouldn't do it

853
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:58,065
You never know

854
01:13:58,865 --> 01:14:00,415
- I know him
- So do l

855
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:02,315
And I know it's him

856
01:14:03,865 --> 01:14:06,165
- You don't believe me?
- You said it

857
01:14:08,865 --> 01:14:09,815
And this?

858
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:13,315
Is that also a lie?

859
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:18,715
The best woman in the world
found her other half

860
01:14:19,865 --> 01:14:22,315
She wore the trousers,
he gave the blows

861
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:25,765
You had many lovers,
none of them are alive today

862
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:29,865
They died, crushed under,
while they were making love

863
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,265
There are times...

864
01:14:34,865 --> 01:14:35,815
We can go

865
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:37,415
You knew Bosco before

866
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:40,765
Did you?

867
01:14:40,865 --> 01:14:42,215
Did you know him?

868
01:14:44,865 --> 01:14:46,965
Great! Thanks for telling me now

869
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:50,565
You told him about Snuff

870
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:52,865
So? Making snuff movies is
something else

871
01:14:52,865 --> 01:14:54,865
Why look for Vanessa's friends?

872
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:55,865
You know who they are

873
01:14:55,865 --> 01:14:58,165
I hardly knew Vanessa or her friends

874
01:14:59,865 --> 01:15:01,215
I only knew Bosco

875
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,415
Why did you fall out?

876
01:15:05,865 --> 01:15:07,865
- I didn't trust him
- Oh, really?

877
01:15:07,865 --> 01:15:09,865
He looks sweet but he's a bastard

878
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:11,815
So are you, you lied to me...

879
01:15:11,865 --> 01:15:13,865
...you said you weren't involved

880
01:15:13,865 --> 01:15:16,315
So you wouldn't associate me
with Bosco!

881
01:15:18,865 --> 01:15:22,515
I didn't want to scare you.
I didn't want you to think that l...

882
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:26,665
And you care what I think?

883
01:15:26,865 --> 01:15:29,015
You're right, think what you like

884
01:15:29,865 --> 01:15:31,965
- Suppose I think that...
- What?

885
01:15:32,865 --> 01:15:34,265
Nothing, forget it

886
01:15:44,865 --> 01:15:45,865
What about the cameras?

887
01:15:45,865 --> 01:15:47,515
I know the security guy

888
01:15:58,865 --> 01:15:59,815
Now what?

889
01:16:01,865 --> 01:16:03,315
It's somewhere here

890
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:13,765
This way

891
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:20,865
These tunnels lead to the old boilers.
No one's been down here in years

892
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:27,765
This way

893
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,115
See? Only tapes

894
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:47,065
Figueroa took the first one he saw

895
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:49,315
How many are there?

896
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:50,815
About 200

897
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:52,415
Must be good business

898
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:55,865
What are you doing?

899
01:16:55,865 --> 01:16:57,515
Looking for the cameras

900
01:17:37,865 --> 01:17:38,615
Shit!

901
01:17:38,865 --> 01:17:40,665
- What is it?
- The masters

902
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,515
- Worth a fortune
- You mean, the originals?

903
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:47,865
- No, but they must be here
- Chema, don't waste time

904
01:17:47,865 --> 01:17:50,465
The unedited originals:
that's our evidence

905
01:17:50,865 --> 01:17:52,815
They must have destroyed them

906
01:17:54,865 --> 01:17:56,065
What was that?

907
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:07,715
- It's closed from outside
- I don't believe it!

908
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:12,115
It may be worse

909
01:18:12,865 --> 01:18:13,665
Worse?

910
01:18:16,865 --> 01:18:19,665
- We've been locked in!
- Chema, where are you?

911
01:18:19,865 --> 01:18:22,865
- Beside you, you're choking me!
- What's going on?

912
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,865
- God knows. Do you smoke?
- No...

913
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:27,465
- Shit, we need a lighter!
- I have matches

914
01:18:28,865 --> 01:18:30,765
- Do you really?
- I think so

915
01:18:31,865 --> 01:18:33,765
You're panting... like a dog

916
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:41,315
Give me the matches

917
01:18:41,865 --> 01:18:43,565
It's half empty... good!

918
01:18:44,865 --> 01:18:47,265
We've got to move,
they mustn't find us

919
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,665
There... over there, look!

920
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:03,415
Someone's watching us

921
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:06,415
It's our shadows...
it's just our shadows!

922
01:19:10,865 --> 01:19:12,215
You disappoint me

923
01:19:12,865 --> 01:19:14,565
- I'm scared
- So am l...

924
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:16,765
...but that won't get us out

925
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:18,865
- What's happened?
- The match's gone out

926
01:19:18,865 --> 01:19:20,065
Chema, hold me

927
01:19:21,865 --> 01:19:23,765
- What?
- Someone touched me!

928
01:19:23,865 --> 01:19:25,565
You told me to hold you!

929
01:19:26,865 --> 01:19:28,065
Don't leave me

930
01:19:36,865 --> 01:19:39,365
Why are you so quiet?
Why don't you talk?

931
01:19:39,865 --> 01:19:41,915
- What can I say?
- I don't know

932
01:19:43,865 --> 01:19:46,115
Tell me who you are,
what do you do?

933
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:49,615
I'm Chema, I'm walking,
I'm walking, I'm Chema

934
01:19:50,865 --> 01:19:52,015
Hi, I'm Chema

935
01:19:53,865 --> 01:19:56,015
You're squeezing my arm too tight

936
01:19:57,865 --> 01:19:58,815
I'm sorry

937
01:19:59,865 --> 01:20:01,565
I'll tell you a story...

938
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:03,165
A children story

939
01:20:04,865 --> 01:20:08,315
Once upon a time, there was
a princess who lived in a palace

940
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:11,565
And?

941
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:12,915
This way...

942
01:20:14,865 --> 01:20:15,865
When she was thirteen...

943
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:19,765
...they gave a great ball for her,
with clowns, jugglers, acrobats...

944
01:20:20,865 --> 01:20:22,665
But the princess was bored

945
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:24,865
Then an ugly dwarf appeared...

946
01:20:25,865 --> 01:20:27,915
He danced, he did pirouettes...

947
01:20:29,865 --> 01:20:32,315
"Please keep dancing",
said the princess

948
01:20:32,865 --> 01:20:36,865
But the dwarf was too tired, so the
sad princess retired to her chamber

949
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:41,365
The dwarf was sure she would go
and live with him in the wood

950
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:45,865
"She's not happy here", he thought

951
01:20:45,865 --> 01:20:48,465
"I'll look after her, I'll make her laugh"

952
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:52,065
So the dwarf searched the palace
for the princess' room

953
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:56,765
But in one of the rooms he saw
something terrible

954
01:20:58,865 --> 01:21:01,915
A monster with eyes which were
bloody and crossed...

955
01:21:03,865 --> 01:21:05,865
...with hairy hands and huge feet

956
01:21:05,865 --> 01:21:09,715
When he realised he was seeing
himself in the mirror, he almost died

957
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:13,215
At that moment,
the princess walked in

958
01:21:13,865 --> 01:21:17,015
"You're back, how nice!
Will you dance with me again?"

959
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:20,665
But the dwarf was lying, lifeless,
on the floor

960
01:21:21,865 --> 01:21:24,065
The court doctor checked his pulse

961
01:21:25,865 --> 01:21:27,865
"He won't dance with you again,
Princess"

962
01:21:27,865 --> 01:21:30,665
"Why?" she asked.
"Because his heart is broken"

963
01:21:32,865 --> 01:21:34,465
And the Princess said:

964
01:21:34,865 --> 01:21:36,115
"From now on...

965
01:21:36,865 --> 01:21:39,615
"...no one with a heart may enter
this palace"

966
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:43,265
Here the story ends
and the match bends

967
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:49,265
There's no way to tell which way to go

968
01:21:49,865 --> 01:21:52,265
- There must be another exit
- So what?

969
01:21:52,865 --> 01:21:54,715
We can't see a bloody thing

970
01:21:54,865 --> 01:21:56,765
Chema, bring the matrch here

971
01:21:56,865 --> 01:21:57,915
What is it?

972
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:09,415
- What now?
- Burn it!

973
01:22:09,865 --> 01:22:10,665
Go on!

974
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:34,615
Shit!

975
01:22:37,865 --> 01:22:39,415
It's the editing room

976
01:22:45,865 --> 01:22:47,165
Look! I told you

977
01:22:48,865 --> 01:22:50,915
These must be the scrapped ones

978
01:22:51,865 --> 01:22:54,665
Maybe, but Bosco's camera
might be one of these

979
01:23:05,865 --> 01:23:06,765
I'm cold

980
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:09,365
Do you want my coat?

981
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:12,865
No, thanks

982
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:14,715
Good...

983
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:21,465
How many matches left?

984
01:23:25,865 --> 01:23:26,615
Shit!

985
01:23:41,865 --> 01:23:42,815
What now?

986
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:45,965
I don't know

987
01:23:46,865 --> 01:23:48,515
Take something else off

988
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:51,515
- Why don't you?
- OK, so it was a daft idea

989
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,665
Are they going to kill us?

990
01:24:01,865 --> 01:24:02,715
Oh, yes

991
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:07,565
What are we going to do?

992
01:24:07,865 --> 01:24:09,365
Shit, it's going out

993
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:11,865
Never mind

994
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:18,465
I can't see your face. I can't tell
if it's you or someone else

995
01:24:20,865 --> 01:24:21,715
Five...

996
01:24:22,865 --> 01:24:24,315
Four, three, two...

997
01:24:25,865 --> 01:24:27,565
- It's not funny
- One...

998
01:24:27,865 --> 01:24:29,265
Good-bye, Princess

999
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:33,965
I'm freezing

1000
01:24:35,865 --> 01:24:37,715
You can hug me, if you like

1001
01:24:39,865 --> 01:24:40,665
I like

1002
01:24:42,865 --> 01:24:43,915
Go on, then

1003
01:25:01,865 --> 01:25:02,665
Chema?

1004
01:25:27,865 --> 01:25:29,565
Don't look at the track!

1005
01:25:30,865 --> 01:25:32,565
What colour are my eyes?

1006
01:25:35,865 --> 01:25:38,265
You've fallen in love with him, idiot!

1007
01:25:38,865 --> 01:25:40,415
Why did Figueroa die?

1008
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:44,965
"Because his heart is broken"...

1009
01:26:02,865 --> 01:26:04,715
The police knows everything

1010
01:26:04,865 --> 01:26:06,565
You've lied to me before

1011
01:26:08,865 --> 01:26:11,015
You killed Vanessa and the others

1012
01:26:11,865 --> 01:26:13,565
I've never killed anyone

1013
01:26:14,865 --> 01:26:16,415
I only edit the films

1014
01:26:16,865 --> 01:26:19,165
- Have you seen them?
- They're filth

1015
01:26:21,865 --> 01:26:24,015
You give the public what it wants

1016
01:26:26,865 --> 01:26:28,515
It's just the beginning

1017
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,415
Who killed them then?

1018
01:26:36,865 --> 01:26:40,115
I'll tell you if you tell me
who phoned you this morning

1019
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,065
You know what's going
to happen now

1020
01:26:55,865 --> 01:26:57,715
That person won't be coming

1021
01:26:58,865 --> 01:27:00,565
I don't know where he is

1022
01:27:01,865 --> 01:27:04,565
You're lucky, because I won't
make you suffer

1023
01:27:08,865 --> 01:27:10,215
lt'll be painless

1024
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:21,065
Now, please...

1025
01:27:22,865 --> 01:27:24,365
For your own good...

1026
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:27,365
Don't move your head

1027
01:27:27,865 --> 01:27:29,565
His name is Jorge Castro

1028
01:27:29,865 --> 01:27:31,615
He's pointing a gun at me

1029
01:27:31,865 --> 01:27:32,965
Very well...

1030
01:27:33,865 --> 01:27:34,865
Don't move

1031
01:27:37,865 --> 01:27:40,365
My name is Angela,
I'm going to be killed

1032
01:27:41,865 --> 01:27:42,715
Exactly

1033
01:28:11,865 --> 01:28:12,815
He's dead

1034
01:28:14,865 --> 01:28:16,865
You wanted to see a killing, right?

1035
01:28:16,865 --> 01:28:18,565
Wanted to see a killing?

1036
01:28:24,865 --> 01:28:26,365
I've found a way out

1037
01:28:31,865 --> 01:28:34,015
I didn't pull the trigger, he did

1038
01:28:34,865 --> 01:28:36,215
I didn't kill him

1039
01:28:37,865 --> 01:28:39,765
What are we going to do now?

1040
01:28:41,865 --> 01:28:43,065
What do we do?

1041
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:45,815
For a start, shut your mouth!

1042
01:28:46,865 --> 01:28:49,215
We mustn't see each other for a while

1043
01:28:51,865 --> 01:28:53,815
I'll take the masters with me

1044
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:56,915
Let the bastard come after them

1045
01:28:58,865 --> 01:29:00,365
And if it's not him?

1046
01:29:07,865 --> 01:29:08,865
The Third Man

1047
01:29:08,865 --> 01:29:11,215
- Citizen Kane?
- No, The Third Man...

1048
01:29:11,865 --> 01:29:12,815
Told you!

1049
01:29:39,865 --> 01:29:40,865
What's wrong?

1050
01:29:40,865 --> 01:29:41,865
Nothing...

1051
01:29:42,865 --> 01:29:44,165
I'm going to bed

1052
01:29:45,865 --> 01:29:48,715
I thought you were out with Sena
and your friend

1053
01:29:51,865 --> 01:29:52,865
Which friend?

1054
01:29:52,865 --> 01:29:55,615
Bosco, he phoned a while ago
and they went out

1055
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:06,315
Did they say where?

1056
01:30:33,865 --> 01:30:35,865
- What are you doing here?
- Where is he?

1057
01:30:35,865 --> 01:30:38,865
- In the toilet. Want a drink?
- No, let's get out!

1058
01:30:39,865 --> 01:30:41,965
He left his girl, he fancies me!

1059
01:30:42,865 --> 01:30:44,065
Let's go home!

1060
01:30:44,865 --> 01:30:45,565
Why?

1061
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:54,465
Sena, please, just go!

1062
01:30:54,865 --> 01:30:56,715
- Why?
- Bosco's with me now

1063
01:30:57,865 --> 01:31:01,465
- He's not interested in you
- And I'm supposed to believe you?

1064
01:31:49,865 --> 01:31:51,515
I'm going to the toilet

1065
01:31:52,865 --> 01:31:54,015
It's that way

1066
01:32:23,865 --> 01:32:25,165
What's going on?

1067
01:32:25,865 --> 01:32:28,565
- Don't hurt me!
- How am I going to do that?

1068
01:32:29,865 --> 01:32:31,615
What do you want from me?

1069
01:32:31,865 --> 01:32:34,365
- Leave my sister alone
- It's you I want

1070
01:32:34,865 --> 01:32:35,815
What for?

1071
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:54,715
I told you not to come here

1072
01:33:02,865 --> 01:33:04,465
Let's go to the police

1073
01:33:04,865 --> 01:33:06,165
Sure, right away

1074
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:10,765
- I mean it
- Leave me alone!

1075
01:33:11,865 --> 01:33:13,865
- Hey, move aside!
- You little shit!

1076
01:33:13,865 --> 01:33:16,865
- I don't want to go to jail
- You won't, it was self-defence

1077
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:19,115
- Who'll believe me?
- It's on tape!

1078
01:33:19,865 --> 01:33:22,565
- We now know about the cameras...
- So what?

1079
01:33:25,865 --> 01:33:27,465
The cops don't like me

1080
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:29,915
Nobody does

1081
01:33:48,865 --> 01:33:50,015
Last night...

1082
01:33:54,865 --> 01:33:55,865
Chema, I can't take any more

1083
01:33:55,865 --> 01:33:57,065
You don't say!

1084
01:33:59,865 --> 01:34:02,215
Let's go to the police or I'll go mad

1085
01:34:09,865 --> 01:34:11,365
Where are you going?

1086
01:34:12,865 --> 01:34:15,415
To take a shower.
We must look presentable

1087
01:34:18,865 --> 01:34:20,315
I won't abandon you

1088
01:34:20,865 --> 01:34:21,865
Nor me you

1089
01:34:56,865 --> 01:34:59,765
- Chema, where are the masters?
- Can't hear you!

1090
01:37:30,865 --> 01:37:32,165
Hello? Police...

1091
01:37:39,865 --> 01:37:41,665
Why did you bolt the door?

1092
01:37:41,865 --> 01:37:44,215
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

1093
01:37:44,865 --> 01:37:46,865
- Someone's been calling all day
- Who?

1094
01:37:46,865 --> 01:37:48,865
Don't know, they thought I was you

1095
01:37:48,865 --> 01:37:50,265
What did they say?

1096
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:53,565
That I'm a whore and they're
going to kill me

1097
01:37:55,865 --> 01:37:56,765
It's him

1098
01:38:03,865 --> 01:38:04,815
Angela...

1099
01:38:05,865 --> 01:38:07,015
It was a girl

1100
01:38:11,865 --> 01:38:13,665
Bosco, I know you're there

1101
01:38:14,865 --> 01:38:16,665
You can't fool me any more

1102
01:38:17,865 --> 01:38:20,865
Stop lying... you were seen last night
at the disco

1103
01:38:21,865 --> 01:38:23,065
How could you?

1104
01:38:23,865 --> 01:38:26,165
The bitch doesn't love you, she lies

1105
01:38:26,865 --> 01:38:29,165
They all do! Nobody loves you
as I do

1106
01:38:31,865 --> 01:38:34,115
Bosco, you can't leave me like this

1107
01:38:34,865 --> 01:38:36,115
You just can't!

1108
01:38:36,865 --> 01:38:38,415
I won't let you do it

1109
01:38:38,865 --> 01:38:41,115
You know I'm capable of anything...

1110
01:38:42,865 --> 01:38:44,115
Do you hear me?

1111
01:38:52,865 --> 01:38:55,565
- Don't let anyone in!
- Where are you going?

1112
01:38:55,865 --> 01:38:57,115
I won't be long

1113
01:40:09,865 --> 01:40:12,465
- What are you doing here?
- Can I come in?

1114
01:40:23,865 --> 01:40:26,565
I called your home,
they gave me this address

1115
01:40:26,865 --> 01:40:28,515
I come here on weekends

1116
01:40:30,865 --> 01:40:31,865
Come on in

1117
01:40:36,865 --> 01:40:39,765
- Are you alone?
- My parents only come in summer

1118
01:40:43,865 --> 01:40:46,215
- Sorry to bother you...
- Don't worry

1119
01:40:46,865 --> 01:40:48,565
I was trying to study...

1120
01:40:54,865 --> 01:40:56,215
I'm glad you came

1121
01:40:56,865 --> 01:40:59,315
- Yolanda knows about last nigh
- I know

1122
01:41:00,865 --> 01:41:02,615
I want you to talk to her

1123
01:41:03,865 --> 01:41:04,815
What for?

1124
01:41:08,865 --> 01:41:10,115
We've broken up

1125
01:41:10,865 --> 01:41:12,665
She's been calling my home

1126
01:41:12,865 --> 01:41:13,865
lgnore her

1127
01:41:13,865 --> 01:41:15,615
She threatened to kill me

1128
01:41:16,865 --> 01:41:18,365
You're not the first

1129
01:41:22,865 --> 01:41:24,215
What do you mean?

1130
01:41:24,865 --> 01:41:27,365
She can't stand me talking
to other girls

1131
01:41:28,865 --> 01:41:30,315
She's just too much

1132
01:41:30,865 --> 01:41:32,665
She threatened all of them

1133
01:41:33,865 --> 01:41:34,965
Vanessa too?

1134
01:41:36,865 --> 01:41:37,615
What?

1135
01:41:40,865 --> 01:41:42,915
She knew about you and Vanessa?

1136
01:41:43,865 --> 01:41:45,465
What are you on about?

1137
01:41:45,865 --> 01:41:48,315
There was nothing between me
and Vanessa

1138
01:41:53,865 --> 01:41:55,815
You're always up to something

1139
01:41:58,865 --> 01:42:00,115
Yolanda's right

1140
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:02,465
You are something else

1141
01:42:04,865 --> 01:42:06,815
I'm beginning to think so too

1142
01:42:08,865 --> 01:42:09,915
Poor Angela

1143
01:42:10,865 --> 01:42:12,115
Always tense...

1144
01:42:13,865 --> 01:42:15,065
So I should be

1145
01:42:16,865 --> 01:42:17,565
Why?

1146
01:42:22,865 --> 01:42:23,915
What is it?

1147
01:42:25,865 --> 01:42:27,415
I don't want to go on

1148
01:42:29,865 --> 01:42:31,515
Are you toying with me?

1149
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:36,165
I'd better leave

1150
01:42:37,865 --> 01:42:40,565
- You were different last night
- I was drunk

1151
01:42:40,865 --> 01:42:41,565
Liar

1152
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:44,865
Are you ever going to tell me?

1153
01:42:45,865 --> 01:42:47,665
- What?
- That you fancy me

1154
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:51,915
I fancy you

1155
01:42:53,865 --> 01:42:55,165
Let's do it then

1156
01:43:01,865 --> 01:43:03,115
It's the lights

1157
01:43:03,865 --> 01:43:05,365
Must be a blown fuse

1158
01:43:05,865 --> 01:43:07,165
I'll have a look

1159
01:43:53,865 --> 01:43:54,665
Bosco?

1160
01:45:06,865 --> 01:45:09,215
- I've come to save you again
- Don't!

1161
01:45:09,865 --> 01:45:11,715
Come on, give me the gun...

1162
01:45:28,865 --> 01:45:30,565
Wanted kill me, did you?

1163
01:45:47,865 --> 01:45:50,215
Son of a bitch, you tried to kill me!

1164
01:45:51,865 --> 01:45:53,165
You little shit!

1165
01:45:53,865 --> 01:45:55,165
You always were!

1166
01:46:01,865 --> 01:46:02,865
Call an ambulance

1167
01:46:02,865 --> 01:46:04,465
Let's tie him up first

1168
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:12,915
Why, Chema?

1169
01:46:22,865 --> 01:46:23,565
Why?

1170
01:46:25,865 --> 01:46:27,015
The garage...

1171
01:46:32,865 --> 01:46:33,865
The garage...

1172
01:46:33,865 --> 01:46:35,065
Out of the way

1173
01:47:45,865 --> 01:47:47,415
I'm going to kill you

1174
01:48:06,865 --> 01:48:07,965
Say hello...

1175
01:48:09,865 --> 01:48:10,965
Say: "hello"

1176
01:48:14,865 --> 01:48:16,715
She went mad this afternoon

1177
01:48:17,865 --> 01:48:19,215
I had to kill her

1178
01:48:21,865 --> 01:48:23,365
She never understood

1179
01:48:24,865 --> 01:48:27,165
In fact, I thought you were cleverer

1180
01:48:28,865 --> 01:48:30,515
But you've gone too far

1181
01:48:35,865 --> 01:48:38,565
Right, let me tell you what we're
going to do

1182
01:48:38,865 --> 01:48:40,865
Hello, hello, testing, testing

1183
01:48:41,865 --> 01:48:43,665
Look at the camera, please

1184
01:48:48,865 --> 01:48:50,865
First I'm going to beat you up

1185
01:48:51,865 --> 01:48:53,065
For a while...

1186
01:48:54,865 --> 01:48:57,865
Then you'll faint and I'll wait till you
come round

1187
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:00,965
Then I'll cut your arms and legs

1188
01:49:01,865 --> 01:49:03,465
Then I'll mutilate you

1189
01:49:03,865 --> 01:49:05,315
I'm not sure how...

1190
01:49:05,865 --> 01:49:07,665
I'll decide as we go along

1191
01:49:09,865 --> 01:49:11,665
If I chop off your hand...

1192
01:49:11,865 --> 01:49:13,765
...l may put it on your head

1193
01:49:13,865 --> 01:49:14,865
Like a coronet

1194
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:16,665
Those camp things are cool

1195
01:49:18,865 --> 01:49:21,565
Or I'll make you eat your ear
and if I can...

1196
01:49:22,865 --> 01:49:25,415
...I'll take out your guts before you die

1197
01:49:25,865 --> 01:49:27,415
Terrifying, isn't it?

1198
01:49:27,865 --> 01:49:28,915
Look at me!

1199
01:49:29,865 --> 01:49:31,265
Terrifying, right?

1200
01:49:37,865 --> 01:49:39,665
When you're almost dead...

1201
01:49:40,865 --> 01:49:42,865
...I'll shoot you in the mouth

1202
01:49:45,865 --> 01:49:48,315
Then I'll chop you up
and get rid of you

1203
01:49:48,865 --> 01:49:51,065
You did a really bad job on Castro

1204
01:49:53,865 --> 01:49:54,915
Right, then

1205
01:49:56,865 --> 01:49:57,915
We're ready

1206
01:50:41,865 --> 01:50:42,915
Don't move!

1207
01:50:45,865 --> 01:50:46,915
Don't move!

1208
01:50:55,865 --> 01:50:56,865
It's that hand...

1209
01:50:56,865 --> 01:50:58,165
I won't hurt you

1210
01:50:58,865 --> 01:50:59,865
That hand...

1211
01:50:59,865 --> 01:51:01,215
Tell me one thing

1212
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,565
What colour are my eyes?

1213
01:51:36,865 --> 01:51:38,415
"Justice and the Law"

1214
01:51:42,865 --> 01:51:43,865
Good evening

1215
01:51:43,865 --> 01:51:46,515
When love, torture, death
and money merge...

1216
01:51:48,865 --> 01:51:52,515
...we come across events such as
the much publicised recent case

1217
01:51:52,865 --> 01:51:55,615
I refer to the case known as the
"Snuff Girls"

1218
01:52:02,865 --> 01:52:04,865
Bosco was a nice, studious
young man

1219
01:52:04,865 --> 01:52:08,015
A very normal kid, according
to his friends and family

1220
01:52:08,865 --> 01:52:11,015
Buried in this ordinary garden...

1221
01:52:11,865 --> 01:52:14,865
...are bodies of six girls who've been
missing since 1993...

1222
01:52:14,865 --> 01:52:16,965
...including his own girl friend

1223
01:52:17,865 --> 01:52:21,315
This week, the police have found
a number of snuff movies...

1224
01:52:22,865 --> 01:52:26,865
...and documents which incriminate
Jorge Castro, professor of cinema...

1225
01:52:27,865 --> 01:52:30,565
... who was killed accidentally
on the 3rd...

1226
01:52:30,865 --> 01:52:33,615
...as he was about to start
a Snuff production

1227
01:52:33,865 --> 01:52:37,065
The police gives no further
information about this case

1228
01:52:37,865 --> 01:52:40,415
This, for Spain, is the first
occurence...

1229
01:52:40,865 --> 01:52:43,815
...of the tragic phenomenon
known as "Snuff" movie

1230
01:52:48,865 --> 01:52:51,515
I couldn't come, I was hounded
by the police

1231
01:52:51,865 --> 01:52:52,765
So was l

1232
01:52:53,865 --> 01:52:55,115
I saw you on TV

1233
01:52:55,865 --> 01:52:57,015
By the way...

1234
01:52:57,865 --> 01:52:59,365
I'm switching it off

1235
01:52:59,865 --> 01:53:01,715
Hey, this is the best part!

1236
01:53:03,865 --> 01:53:04,965
They obey me

1237
01:53:07,865 --> 01:53:08,965
How are you?

1238
01:53:09,865 --> 01:53:11,565
I'm getting out tomorrow

1239
01:53:12,865 --> 01:53:14,665
I've brought you something

1240
01:53:25,865 --> 01:53:27,765
"The Princess and the Dwarf"

1241
01:53:29,865 --> 01:53:31,415
I've got this edition

1242
01:53:31,865 --> 01:53:33,415
This one is dedicated

1243
01:53:35,865 --> 01:53:37,515
I don't have my glasses

1244
01:53:44,865 --> 01:53:48,215
The day I discovered the tunnels,
I also found the cameras

1245
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:51,065
And I took one

1246
01:53:51,865 --> 01:53:52,565
Why?

1247
01:53:54,865 --> 01:53:56,665
You know me, I'm a bastard

1248
01:53:58,865 --> 01:54:00,365
Punch me if you like

1249
01:54:00,865 --> 01:54:03,315
I don't like...
Why don't you look at me

1250
01:54:03,865 --> 01:54:05,115
I don't want to

1251
01:54:08,865 --> 01:54:10,065
So I'll be off

1252
01:54:11,865 --> 01:54:12,565
Why?

1253
01:54:13,865 --> 01:54:14,715
Because

1254
01:54:15,865 --> 01:54:16,715
Go then

1255
01:54:20,865 --> 01:54:22,615
Good luck with the thesis

1256
01:54:22,865 --> 01:54:24,215
I've abandoned it

1257
01:54:25,865 --> 01:54:27,365
Can we watch TV now?

1258
01:54:28,865 --> 01:54:29,865
Grandad...

1259
01:54:30,865 --> 01:54:33,115
Can you read the dedication for me?

1260
01:54:42,865 --> 01:54:45,065
"First Edition, February 1992..."

1261
01:54:45,865 --> 01:54:47,315
Just the dedication

1262
01:54:47,865 --> 01:54:49,865
"...popular poetry and prose
collection"

1263
01:54:49,865 --> 01:54:50,865
"How about coffee?"

1264
01:54:50,865 --> 01:54:52,565
"No part of this work...

1265
01:54:53,865 --> 01:54:56,715
"...may be reproduced in any form,
including..."

1266
01:55:00,865 --> 01:55:04,715
...in which reality and fiction combine
to produce a horror story...

1267
01:55:04,865 --> 01:55:07,565
...beyond the capability of any
rational mind

1268
01:55:07,865 --> 01:55:10,465
We can only wonder: how can
anyone do that?

1269
01:55:28,865 --> 01:55:31,965
Is there really a public that demands
and consumes...

1270
01:55:32,865 --> 01:55:33,865
... this genre of cinema?

1271
01:55:33,865 --> 01:55:36,365
Well, the long-awaited moment
has arrived

1272
01:55:37,865 --> 01:55:40,215
As announced, our team has
acquired...

1273
01:55:40,865 --> 01:55:42,815
...one of those macabre tapes

1274
01:55:44,865 --> 01:55:46,715
What you're about to see...

1275
01:55:46,865 --> 01:55:50,315
...is the actual scene of Vanessa
being savagely tortured...

1276
01:55:50,865 --> 01:55:54,515
...and subjected to all types of
atrocities, before being killed

1277
01:55:55,865 --> 01:55:58,465
Reluctant as we are to show
this footage...

1278
01:55:58,865 --> 01:56:01,515
... we believe they're of interest
to us all

1279
01:56:02,865 --> 01:56:05,215
The savage violence speaks for itself

1280
01:56:12,865 --> 01:56:13,915
Here it is:

1281
01:56:16,865 --> 01:56:17,865
"Warning :

1282
01:56:17,865 --> 01:56:19,865
"The images you are about to see
are extremely violent

1283
01:56:19,865 --> 01:56:22,365
"Some spectators may find them
offensive"
