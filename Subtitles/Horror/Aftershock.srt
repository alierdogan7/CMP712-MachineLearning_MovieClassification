Cabernet Sauvignon,
Merlot, Shiraz, Chivas,
and Sauvignon Blanc.

7
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:13,685
Centuries ago huge festivals
were held at the end of the
grape harvest.

8
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,555
And the virgins of the different
towns would stomp the grapes

9
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:20,058
to make the wine. As you have
seen today now it's a much more

10
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,227
sophisticated process.

11
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,230
Do you have any questions?
No?

12
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:29,301
OK, feel free to look around
and take pictures.

13
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,303
Actually I have a question,

00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,804
can you take a photo of me
and my friends?

15
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,239
- Sure.
- Thanks.

16
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,474
Just push right there.

17
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,476
- Halfway to focus.
- OK.

before you taste the wine,

the different aromas in
this Cabernet.

You unfollowed her
for a reason.

39
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,248
I just want to know if she
tweeted that guy again.

40

Dude, you don't have x-ray
vision to see her DM's.

41

No, but I know her well enough
to know what she's not saying.

download some new app.

It was a foreign name,
'cause we're not from here.

You know, like Bali.

That's the real Chile.

136
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,693
People think Chile is like
<i>City of God</i> or something.

137
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:44,896
Or like Juarez, like there's
bodies hanging in the streets.

This place is awesome!

139

It's like really cool,
the food here is so fresh.

Technically yes, same dad.

It's not like I know her, she
was off with her mom in Hungary.

She's a real pain in the ass.

151
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,900
So, I forgave her. But then
she fucked this other guy.

I don't understand why
she keeps texting me.

I know it's in Spanish,
but you get the point, right?

- Right.
- Excuse me.

157
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,213
I can translate it for you.

158
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,450
- You're kidding me?
- It's champagne.

159
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,952
I don't make the rules.

160
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,288
No, you enforce them
which is worse.

161

[girl] Too bad.

162
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,125
Hey, don't worry.

163

When you're 21 you can drink
without anyone's permission.

- I'm not surprised.

Really, why is that?

171
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,193
Because, you're dressed
like a dad.

172
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,629
Fuck you.

173
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,898

like this when we met.

- When did you lose it?
- A year ago.

177
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,809
That's when she
started liking me.

Irina is very pretty.
Girlfriend?

- He's amazing.
- Pollo, what the fuck?

362
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,883
How's that helping Team Gringo?

363
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,618
It's not my fault you're too
slow for this country.

364

- Oh fuck you.
- Fuck me?

365
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,890
Come on Gringo, there's a
million girls over there.

366
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,826
Hey look, look, look.
The cleaning lady isn't
dancing with anyone.

367
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:06,129
Oh maybe I'll tell her
my father owns half the country,
that seems to work.

368
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,666
OK Gringo, if you wanna get
fucked, then call your Ex.

369
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,801
Nobody likes you here.

370

Unlike you who
everybody likes,

371
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:15,439
clearly it has nothing to do
with your Father's money.

372
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,575
Look Gringo,
I am not your buddy, OK?

373
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,311
That's Ariel. So we don't need
to pretend we like each other.

374

- I'm not pretending.
- Me neither.

Come on, Monica, relax.

It's just a little pot,
she's not drinking.

You stay outta this.

He's right, he's right.

389
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,643
You said no drinking.

390
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,378
Monica, you should
take her home.

391
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,147
She's really out of control.

392
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,785
Kylie you're completely wasted.

393
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,154
I'm taking you home. Now.

394
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,556
No.

395

I'm not standing here all night.

396
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,977
I'm finally having fun for
the first time in months.

397
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,244
And you want to ruin it for me.

398
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,579
You want me to be as
miserable as you.

399
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,247
That's not going to happen.

400
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,683
I'm sorry if you're incapable of
having fun without drugs.

401
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,286
- That's not my problem.
- So, what is your problem?

402
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,655
Because you never gave a
shit about me until Daddy
started paying you to.

403
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,025
So go back to India,
go back to your tent.

404
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,927
Go find yourself.

405
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,498
You need to listen to me,
you're outta control.

406
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,367
So, we're leaving now.

407
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:26,770
No. I'm in control,
and you will listen to me.

I'll fuck any guy I want!

Stop it!

411
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:33,610
I already fucked Pollo while you
were in the bathroom,

412
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,014
and I sucked Gringo's cock!

413
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,348
And you know what?

414
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,850
I'm going to fuck
everybody in this club!

415
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,385
Who here wants to
fuck, cause I'm ready!

416
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:44,788
- Are you through?
- Hardly.

417
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,958
You want to know what
Daddy said when she went
off to India to find herself?

418
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,795
I hope she never comes back.

419
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:54,498
I only came to Valparaiso
because I worry about you.

420
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,333
But you don't give a fuck
about anyone else.

421

spoiled, little shit!

who had an abortion
and got Daddy to pay for it!
