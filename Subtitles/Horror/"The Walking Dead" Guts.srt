00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:03,989
Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:05,845
You look at me, stay
with me, you hear me?

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:09,527
Bites kill you.
The fever... burns you out.

4
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,775
But then after a while...
You come back.

5
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:12,983
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

6
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,678
They're alive.
My wife and son.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,334
That boy has been
through too much,

8
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,573
and he's not loosing
his mother too. Okay?

9
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:20,885
Mom?

10
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:28,845
You in the tank.
Cozy in there?

11
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:39,945
Mom!

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,914
<i>Right here.</i>

13
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,729
Any luck?

14
00:00:58,565 --> 00:01:01,333
How do we tell
if they're poison?

15
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,837
Uh, there's only
one sure way I know of.

16
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,907
Ask Shane when he gets back?

17
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,576
Yeah, you've got it.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,944
Thank you.

19
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:17,116
Dale, I'm heading out.

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,985
Sweetheart, I want you to stay
where Dale can see you, okay?

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,754
Yes, mom.

22
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:23,989
You too.
Don't wander too far.

23
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,591
<i>Stay within
shouting distance.</i>

24
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,427
And if you see anything, holler.
I'll come running.

25
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:30,295
Yes, mom.

26
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:07,526
Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh.

27
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,797
You scared the hell out of me.

28
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,066
I bet. That's what you get
for keeping me waiting.

29
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,601
I was trying to be quiet.

30
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,803
- Where you been?
- Amy the mushroom queen...

31
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,972
I had to wait
for her to get back.

32
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,313
- How much time do we have?
- Enough.

33
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:23,969
- Come here.
- Okay.

35
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,635
Hey, are you alive in there?

36
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:35,140
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- There you are.</i>

37
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,909
<i>You had me wondering.</i>

38
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,477
Where are you?
Outside?

39
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,112
Can you see me right now?

40
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,314
<i>Yeah, I can see you.</i>

41
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:45,117
<i>You're surrounded by walkers.
That's the bad news.</i>

42
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,019
There's good news?

43
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,855
<i>- No.
- Listen, whoever you are,</i>

44
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,491
I don't mind telling you I'm
a little concerned in here.

45
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,128
<i>Oh man. You should
see it from over here.</i>

46
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,664
<i>You'd be having
a major freak-out.</i>

47
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:01,166
Got any advice for me?

48
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,536
<i>Yeah, I'd say
make a run for it.</i>

49
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:08,674
That's it?
"Make a run for it"?

50
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,409
<i>My way's not
as dumb as it sounds.</i>

51
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,444
<i>You've got eyes
on the outside here.</i>

52
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,047
<i>There's one geek still up on the tank
but the others have climbed down</i>

53
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,349
<i>and joined the feeding frenzy
where the horse went down.</i>

54
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:19,251
<i>- With me so far?
- So far.</i>

55
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:22,020
<i>Okay, the street on the other side
of the tank is less crowded.</i>

56
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,623
<i>If you move now while they're
distracted, you stand a chance.</i>

57
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:27,392
<i>- Got ammo?
- In that duffel bag I dropped out there,</i>

58
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:28,894
and guns.
Can I get to it?

59
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:31,430
<i>Forget the bag, okay?
It's not an option.</i>

60
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,799
<i>- What do you have on you?
- Hang on.</i>

61
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:54,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

62
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:57,522
I've got a Beretta
with one clip,

63
00:06:57,557 --> 00:07:00,425
<i>- 15 rounds.
- Make 'em count.</i>

64
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,228
<i>Jump off the right side of the tank,
keep going in that direction.</i>

65
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,764
<i>There's an alley up the street,
maybe 50 yards.</i>

66
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:07,699
<i>Be there.</i>

67
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,868
Hey, what's your name?

68
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,704
<i>Have you been listening?
You're running out of time.</i>

69
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:13,972
Right.

70
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:32,758
Ah!

71
00:07:44,737 --> 00:07:46,405
Whoa!
Not dead!

72
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,939
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

73
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:49,741
Back here!

74
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:53,412
Come on! Come on!

75
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,719
What are you doing?!
Come on!

76
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,865
Come on, get up.

77
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,145
Nice moves there,
Clint Eastwood.

78
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,449
You the new sheriff come riding
in to clean up the town?

79
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:33,652
- It wasn't my intention.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeehaw.

80
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:36,455
You're still a dumbass.

81
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:39,191
Rick. Thanks.

82
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,561
Glenn.
You're welcome.

83
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,330
Oh no.

84
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,539
The bright side:

85
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:56,675
It'll be the fall
that kills us.

86
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,277
I'm a glass-half-full
kind of guy.

87
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:07,652
Are you the one that
barricaded the alley?

88
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:10,856
Somebody did... I guess
when the city got overrun.

89
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,758
Whoever did it was thinking not
many geeks would get through.

90
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,927
Back at the tank, why'd you
stick your neck out for me?

91
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,296
Call it foolish, naive hope

92
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,599
that if I'm ever
that far up shit creek,

93
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,134
somebody might
do the same for me.

94
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:24,769
Guess I'm an even bigger
dumbass than you.

95
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,723
I'm back. Got a guest
plus four geeks in the alley.

96
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,807
Let's go!

97
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,178
<i>Morales, let's go!</i>

98
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,249
You son of a bitch.
We ought to kill you.

99
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:14,386
- Just chill out, Andrea. Back off.
- Come on, ease up.

100
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,887
Ease up?
You're kidding me, right?

101
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:18,223
We're dead because
of this stupid asshole.

102
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:21,893
Andrea, I said
back the hell off.

103
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,434
Well, pull the trigger.

104
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,240
We're dead...
All of us...

105
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,143
Because of you.

106
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,547
I don't understand.

107
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:45,617
Look, we came into the city
to scavenge supplies.

108
00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:47,886
<i>You know what the key
to scavenging is? Surviving!</i>

109
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,855
You know the key to surviving?
Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing.

110
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,991
Not shooting up the streets
like it's the O.K. Corral.

111
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,694
Every geek for miles around
heard you popping off rounds.

112
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:57,929
You just rang the dinner bell.

113
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,931
Get the picture now?

114
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,840
Oh God.

115
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,481
What the hell were you
doing out there anyway?

116
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:17,983
Trying to flag the helicopter.

117
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,918
Helicopter?
Man, that's crap.

118
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,053
- Ain't no damn helicopter.
- You were chasing a hallucination,

119
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,556
- imagining things. It happens.
- I saw it.

120
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,627
Hey, T-Dog, try that C.B.
Can you contact the others?

121
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:30,895
Others?
The refugee center?

122
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,798
Yeah, the refugee center. They've got
biscuits waiting at the oven for us.

123
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,068
Got no signal.
Maybe the roof.

124
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:40,572
<i>Oh no. Is that Dixon?</i>

125
00:11:40,606 --> 00:11:43,041
- What is that maniac doing?
- Come on, let's go.

126
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:03,161
Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?!

127
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,498
Oh jeez.

128
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:10,402
Hey! Y'all be more polite
to a man with a gun!

129
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:12,904
Huh? Ah!

130
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:14,739
Only common sense.

131
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,208
Man, you wasting bullets we
ain't even got!

132
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:19,878
And you're bringing even more of them
down on our ass! Man, just chill.

133
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,580
Bad enough I've got this
taco-bender on my ass all day.

134
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,549
Now I'm gonna
take orders from you?

135
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,786
I don't think so, bro.
That'll be the day.

136
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,788
"That'll be the day"?
You got something

137
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:32,157
- you want to tell me?
- Hey, T-Dog man, just leave it.

138
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,692
- No.
- All right? It ain't worth it.

139
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:36,861
Now Merle, just relax, okay?

140
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,863
<i>We've got enough trouble.</i>

141
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:41,366
- You want to know the day?
- Yeah.

142
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,069
I'll tell you
the day, Mr. "Yo."

143
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:46,037
It's the day I take
orders from a nigger.

144
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,473
- Mother...
- Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough.

145
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:50,208
Come on.

146
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:52,410
Dixon!

147
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:53,912
Whoa, cut it out, man!

148
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:57,215
Stop it!
Dixon, get off him!

149
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:58,550
Dixon, you're gonna hurt him.

150
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:04,389
<i>Merle, cut it out!</i>

151
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,532
No no no, please.
Please.

152
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:35,720
Yeah! All right!

153
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:39,090
We're gonna have ourselves
a little powwow, huh?

154
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,727
Talk about who's in charge.

155
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:45,663
I vote me.
Anybody else?

156
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:48,666
Huh?
Democracy time, y'all.

157
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:51,169
Show of hands, huh?

158
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:54,038
<i>All in favor? Huh?</i>

159
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,574
Come on.
Let's see 'em.

160
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:57,776
Oh, come on.

161
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,677
All in favor?

162
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:03,181
Yeah. That's good.

163
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:06,618
Now that means
I'm the boss, right?

164
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:09,988
Yeah. Anybody else?

165
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,824
<i>- Hmm? Anybody?
- Yeah.</i>

166
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,237
- Who the hell are you, man?!
- Officer friendly.

167
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:31,709
Look here, Merle.
Things are different now.

168
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:34,779
<i>There are
no niggers anymore.</i>

169
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:37,916
No dumb-as-shit, inbred
white-trash fools either.

170
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,518
Only dark meat and white meat.

171
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,353
There's us and the dead.

172
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,322
<i>We survive this
by pulling together,</i>

173
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:47,058
- not apart.
- Screw you, man.

174
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:51,095
I can see you make a habit
of missing the point.

175
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,598
Yeah?
Well, screw you twice.

176
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,800
Ought to be polite to a man with a gun.

177
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:57,535
Only common sense.

178
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:02,907
You wouldn't.
You're a cop.

179
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,044
All I am anymore

180
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,580
is a man looking
for his wife and son.

181
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:11,683
Anybody that gets in the way
of that is gonna lose.

182
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll give you a moment
to think about that.

183
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:28,700
Got some on your nose there.

184
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:31,002
What are you gonna do?

185
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:32,637
Arrest me?

186
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,640
Hey! What are you doing?
Man, that was my stuff!

187
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,876
<i>Hey!</i>

188
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,978
If I get loose,
you'd better pray...

189
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:42,847
Yeah, you hear me, you pig?!

190
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,849
<i>- You hear me?!
- Yeah, your voice carries.</i>

191
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,985
<i>Do you hear me,
you filthy pig?!</i>

192
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:51,689
You're not Atlanta P.D.

193
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:57,128
- Where you from?
- Up the road a ways.

194
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:01,232
Well, officer friendly
from up the road a ways,

195
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:04,936
welcome to the big city.

196
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:20,516
My God, it's like
Times Square down there.

197
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,252
- How's that signal?
- Like Dixon's brain...

198
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,355
Weak.

199
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,258
- Keep trying.
- Why? There's nothing they can do.

200
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,893
Not a damn thing.

201
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:34,362
Got some people
outside the city is all.

202
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:36,731
There's no refugee center.
That's a pipe dream.

203
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:38,733
Then she's right.
We're on our own.

204
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,068
It's up to us
to find a way out.

205
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:41,603
Good luck with that.

206
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:44,506
These streets ain't safe in this
part of town from what I hear.

207
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,742
Ain't that right, sugar tits?

208
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:50,011
<i>Hey, honeybunch,</i>

209
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:51,813
what say you get me
out of these cuffs,

210
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:55,083
we go off somewhere
and bump some uglies?

211
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:58,587
- Gonna die anyway.
- I'd rather.

212
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:03,391
Rub muncher.
I figured as much.

213
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:05,460
The streets ain't safe.

214
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,229
Now there's an understatement.

215
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:10,031
What about under the streets?
The sewers?

216
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,134
Oh man.

217
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,236
Hey, Glenn, check the alley.

218
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,904
You see any manhole covers?

219
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,883
No, must be all out on the
street where the geeks are.

220
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:31,119
Maybe not. Old building like
this built in the '20s...

221
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:34,055
Big structures often had
drainage tunnels into the sewers

222
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,491
in case of flooding
down in the subbasements.

223
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:39,261
- How do you know that?
- It's my job... was.

224
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:40,996
I worked in
the city zoning office.

225
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,443
This is it?
Are you sure?

226
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:58,380
I really scoped this place out
the other times I was here.

227
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:00,482
It's the only thing in the
building that goes down.

228
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:03,118
But I've never gone down it.

229
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:05,587
Who'd want to, right?

230
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,928
Oh. Great.

231
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,965
- We'll be right behind you.
- No, you won't. Not you.

232
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:19,234
Why not me?
Think I can't?

233
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,236
I wasn't...

234
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,871
Speak your mind.

235
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:29,044
Look, until now I always
came here by myself...

236
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,680
In and out, grab a few
things... No problem.

237
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:34,349
<i>The first time I bring a group...
Everything goes to hell.</i>

238
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,151
No offense.

239
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:40,822
If you want me to go down
this gnarly hole, fine...

240
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:44,259
But only if we do it my way.

241
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:47,162
<i>It's tight down there. If I run into
something and have to get out quick,</i>

242
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,397
I don't want you all jammed up
behind me getting me killed.

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,002
I'll take one person...
Not you either.

244
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,404
You've got Merle's gun
and I've seen you shoot.

245
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,306
I'd feel better if you
were out in that store

246
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:00,542
watching those doors,
covering our ass.

247
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,877
And you've got the only other
gun, so you should go with him.

248
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:05,981
You be my wingman.
Jacqui stays here.

249
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:08,016
Something happens,
yell down to us,

250
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,618
<i>- get us back up here in a hurry.
- Okay.</i>

251
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:12,754
Okay, everybody knows
their jobs.

252
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:55,096
Dah!

253
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:21,623
Sorry for the gun in your face.

254
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,126
People do things
when they're afraid.

255
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:27,462
Not that it was
entirely unjustified.

256
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,365
You did get us into this.

257
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,534
If I get us out,
would that make up for it?

258
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:35,937
No, but it'd be a start.

259
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,885
Next time though,
take the safety off.

260
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,420
It won't shoot otherwise.

261
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,791
- Oh.
- Is that your gun?

262
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:58,793
It was a gift. Why?

263
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,300
Little red dot means
it's ready to fire.

264
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,669
You may have occasion
to use it.

265
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:12,440
Good to know.

266
00:21:15,244 --> 00:21:17,612
Anybody out there?

267
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,685
<i>Hello?
Anybody read?</i>

268
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:25,186
<i>I'm hoping to hear
somebody's voice</i>

269
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:27,088
'cause I'm getting sick
and tired of hearing mine.

270
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:29,524
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

271
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,559
Why don't you knock
that crap off?

272
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,161
You're giving me
a headache, boy.

273
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,964
Why don't you pull
your head out of your ass?

274
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:37,799
Maybe your headache
will go away.

275
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:41,703
Try some
positivity for a change. Damn.

276
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:43,538
I'll tell you what...

277
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:45,039
You get me out of these cuffs

278
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:47,776
and I'll be all "Sammy
Sunshine" positive for you.

279
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:53,448
Hey, see that hacksaw over
there in that toolbag?

280
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:58,920
Get it for me, hmm?
Make it worth your while.

281
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,688
What do you say, man?
Come on.

282
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:02,590
Get me out of these things.

283
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,692
So you can beat my ass again?

284
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:08,296
Or call me nigger some more?

285
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,799
Come on now.
It wasn't personal.

286
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,768
It's just that your kind and
my kind ain't meant to mix.

287
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:16,004
<i>That's all.</i>

288
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:18,773
It don't mean we can't...
Work together,

289
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,910
parley, as long as there's some
kind of mutual gain involved.

290
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:28,583
So... about that hacksaw...

291
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,685
I guess you want me to get
that rifle over there too

292
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:33,087
so you can shoot that cop
when he comes back up, huh?

293
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:39,194
Huh.

294
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:51,806
Yeah, we've got ourselves
a sewer tunnel.

295
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:53,508
Jacqui was right.

296
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,411
Can we cut through it?

297
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:59,280
If we had a blowtorch
and half a day, sure.

298
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:02,217
Dale's hacksaw sure
as hell won't do it.

299
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:18,366
Oh.

300
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,373
See something you like?

301
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:28,810
Not me, but I know
someone who would...

302
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:32,447
My sister.

303
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,949
She's still such
a kid in some ways.

304
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:36,885
Unicorns, dragons...

305
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:38,720
She's into all that stuff.

306
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:41,055
But mermaids...
They rule.

307
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,825
She loves mermaids.

308
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:45,426
Why not take it?

309
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:48,763
There's a cop staring at me.

310
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:55,336
Would it be considered looting?

311
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:00,808
I don't think those rules
apply anymore. Do you?

312
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,962
- What did you find down there?
- Not a way out.

313
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:24,165
We need to find a way...

314
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,800
And soon.

315
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,360
That construction site, those trucks...
They always keep keys on hand.

316
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,931
<i>You'll never make it
past the walkers.</i>

317
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,333
You got me out of that tank.

318
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,869
Yeah, but they were feeding.
They were distracted.

319
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,403
Can we distract them again?

320
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,773
Right. Listen to him.
He's onto something.

321
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:52,275
A diversion,
like on "Hogan's Heroes."

322
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,345
- God. Give it a rest.
- They're drawn by sound, right?

323
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:58,548
Right, like dogs.
They hear a sound, they come.

324
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,450
- What else?
- Aside from they hear you?

325
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:03,186
They see you, smell you and if
they catch you, they eat you.

326
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,222
- They can tell us by smell?
- Can't you?

327
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:08,892
They smell dead, we don't.
It's pretty distinct.

328
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:15,698
If bad ideas were
an olympic event,

329
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,567
- this would take the gold.
- He's right.

330
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,803
Just stop, okay?
Take some time to think this through.

331
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:22,305
How much time? They already
got through one set of doors,

332
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,840
that glass won't hold forever.

333
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:22,665
Wayne Dunlap.

334
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,868
Georgia license.

335
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:28,905
<i>Born in 1979.</i>

336
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,846
<i>He had $28 in his pocket
when he died...</i>

337
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:40,650
And a picture of a pretty girl.

338
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:47,357
"With love,
from Rachel."

339
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:49,859
He used to be like us...

340
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:52,128
<i>Worrying about bills</i>

341
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:55,598
<i>or the rent
or the Super Bowl.</i>

342
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:01,504
If I ever find my family, I'm
gonna tell them about Wayne.

343
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,881
One more thing...

344
00:27:13,284 --> 00:27:15,451
He was an organ donor.

345
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,156
Oh!

346
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,692
<i>Madre de Dios!</i>

347
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:26,496
Oh! God!

348
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,031
Gack!

349
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,034
<i>- Oh God.
- Oh.</i>

350
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:34,070
Dios!

351
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:35,738
Oh God.

352
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:51,354
Keep chopping.

353
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:57,226
- I am so gonna hurl.
- Later.

354
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,409
Everybody got gloves?

355
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:17,814
Don't get any on your
skin or in your eyes.

356
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,111
Oh God!

357
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,180
Oh jeez.
Oh, this is bad.

358
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,782
This is really bad.

359
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,283
Think about something else...

360
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,885
Puppies and kittens.

361
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,954
Dead puppies and kittens.

362
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:04,060
That is just evil.
What is wrong with you?

363
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:06,429
Next time let
the cracker beat his ass.

364
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,999
<i>- I'm sorry, yo.
- You suck.</i>

365
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:16,706
- Do we smell like them?
- Oh yeah.

366
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,709
Glenn.

367
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,546
Just in case.

368
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:33,022
If we make it back, be ready.

369
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:34,824
What about Merle Dixon?

370
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,472
Give me the axe.

371
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:54,577
- We need... we need more guts.
- Oh God!

372
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,757
Hey, what's happening, man?

373
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,059
Hey, T-Dog,
try that C.B.

374
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:51,861
Hey, come on.
Talk to me, y'all.

375
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:54,931
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

376
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,033
<i>Can anybody
out there hear me?</i>

377
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:01,704
<i>There.</i>

378
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:04,774
That asshole is out on the
street with the handcuff keys?

379
00:32:15,652 --> 00:32:19,689
Boy, that hose isn't long
for this world, is it?

380
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:22,258
No sir.

381
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:25,194
Where the hell are we
gonna find a replacement?

382
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:28,598
It's late.
They should've been back by now.

383
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:30,800
Worrying won't make it better.

384
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:38,941
- Attaboy.
- Yeah.

385
00:32:38,976 --> 00:32:40,977
And three, two,
one... pull it.

386
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:43,012
Ah! Aw.

387
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:46,415
Start it over.

388
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,219
Make your "p" the other
way... around your finger.

389
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:53,522
- Oops.
- Good, just tie it like around your finger.

390
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,359
Attaboy.

391
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,427
Hello, base camp!

392
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,265
<i>Can anybody
out there hear me?</i>

393
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,071
<i>Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?</i>

394
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:10,973
Hello? Hello?

395
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:12,742
<i>Reception's bad
on this end.</i>

396
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:15,945
<i>- Repeat. Repeat.
- Shane, is that you?</i>

397
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,480
Is that them?

398
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:19,482
<i>We're in some deep shit.</i>

399
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:22,551
<i>We're trapped in
the department store.</i>

400
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,388
<i>- He say they're trapped?
- There are geeks all over the place.</i>

401
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:28,090
<i>Hundreds of 'em.
We're surrounded.</i>

402
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,293
T-Dog, repeat that last.
Repeat.

403
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,769
<i>He said the department store.</i>

404
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:42,638
I heard it too.

405
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,707
- Shane?
- No way.

406
00:33:44,741 --> 00:33:46,475
We do not go after them.

407
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,344
We do not risk
the rest of the group.

408
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:51,047
- Y'all know that.
- So we're just gonna leave her there?

409
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:54,617
Look, Amy, I know that
this is not easy...

410
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:56,118
She volunteered to go

411
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:57,820
to help the rest of us.

412
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,456
I know, and she knew
the risks, right?

413
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,659
See, if she's trapped,
she's gone.

414
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,762
So we just have to
deal with that.

415
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:09,265
There's nothing we can do.

416
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,402
She's my sister,
you son of a bitch.

417
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,484
Amy...

418
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,888
Come on.
It's all right, buddy.

419
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,482
It's gonna work.
I can't believe it.

420
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:32,719
Don't draw attention.

421
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:07,220
Oh man.

422
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:24,704
It's just a cloudburst.

423
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:27,140
We get 'em all the time.
It'll pass real quick.

424
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,540
The smell's washing off.
Isn't it?

425
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:02,342
<i>- Is it washing off?
- No, it's not.</i>

426
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,782
Well, maybe.

427
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:12,352
Run!

428
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:27,534
Come on, come on, come on.

429
00:37:57,765 --> 00:37:59,232
Rick!

430
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:16,549
Go go go go!

431
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:40,340
- They're leaving us.
- What? What?

432
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:42,709
- Where they going? Where they going?
- No no, come back.

433
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:49,949
Oh my God. Oh my God.
They're all over that place.

434
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:51,317
You need to draw them away.

435
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,253
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store...

436
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:54,921
That area? That's what
I need cleared.

437
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:57,924
Raise your friends.
Tell them to get down there and be ready.

438
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,693
And I'm drawing the geeks away how?
I... I missed that part.

439
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,362
Noise.

440
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:36,763
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store

441
00:39:36,797 --> 00:39:38,598
facing the street...
Meet us there and be ready.

442
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:56,616
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!
- Hey, you can't leave me here!

443
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,418
I'm not fooling, man!
Morales!

444
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:01,054
- Hey, man! Don't do this!
- Come on.

445
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:02,956
Hey, that's my gun.
You can't leave me.

446
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:05,191
<i>- Don't leave me here, you guys.
- Morales, come on.</i>

447
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,126
I'm coming!
We've gotta go!

448
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:09,729
Morales!
You can't leave me like this, man!

449
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:11,631
Hey, T-Dog. No, man.
You can't leave me, man.

450
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:13,299
You can't leave me here...
Not like this.

451
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:15,101
You can't, man.
It's not human.

452
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:17,637
Come on, don't do this.

453
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:19,672
Come on, T.
Come on!

454
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:21,875
Come on, yeah!
Yeah!

455
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:24,510
Come on! Co... That's it!
Yes! Come on, baby!

456
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,146
Come on.

457
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:38,825
Go.

458
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:44,664
Son of a bitch!
You did that on purpose!

459
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:47,166
- I didn't mean to!
- You lie! You did it on purpose!

460
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:49,969
- It was an accident!
- Don't leave me, man!

461
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:53,206
<i>Don't leave me! Don't leave me!</i>

462
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,975
<i>- You liar!
- I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry.</i>

463
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,745
- Don't leave me!
- I'm sorry.

464
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:01,047
Damn you all!

465
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:03,016
<i>Don't leave me, man!</i>

466
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,252
<i>- Don't leave... don't leave me!
- Ah!</i>

467
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,756
<i>Hey!
What are you doing, man?</i>

468
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,758
You're gonna rot in hell!

469
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,393
You're gonna rot in hell!

470
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:16,029
<i>- Come back, man!
- Wait a minute!</i>

471
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:18,264
Here I come!
Don't leave me!

472
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:20,099
Don't leave!

473
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:24,437
Okay. Okay.

474
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,306
I got it.

475
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:31,711
<i>Shh.</i>

476
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:33,980
<i>What is that?</i>

477
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:47,927
Come on. Come on.

478
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,865
Get closer. Get closer.
Come on. Come on.

479
00:42:29,803 --> 00:42:32,005
Hey, wait for me!

480
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:45,551
They're here! Let's go!
They're in here!

481
00:42:46,687 --> 00:42:48,287
- Let's go!
- Open the door!

482
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:53,126
- We've gotta go!
- Go!

483
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:03,736
I'm in!

484
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:19,886
Don't leave me!

485
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,156
You'll die! Go to hell!
Damn you!

486
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:29,195
You're gonna rot in hell!

487
00:43:52,686 --> 00:43:55,221
I dropped the damn key.

488
00:44:04,164 --> 00:44:06,032
