00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:05,328
You find out who did this
and you bring them to me!

3
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:06,419
Do you understand?

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,305
You were out on your own
when Daryl found you.

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:09,456
- That's right.
- I just want to make sure

6
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,060
you know how to play on a team.

7
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,386
That veterinary college...

8
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:14,109
The drugs are the same we need.

9
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:14,932
I'm glad you're here.

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,543
- Where else would I be?
- Running off.

11
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,292
Daryl's got a group going out.

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,457
I gotta go.

13
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,331
Make a run for the gaps right there.

14
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:27,178
Carol, did you kill
Karen and David?

15
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,106
Yes.

17
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,376
- Ma'am?
- Hi, Lizzy.

18
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:19,817
They told me to come down here.

19
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:21,652
Are you okay?

20
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:24,855
Good.

21
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:30,077
I wanted to see you because
I'm going on a run with Rick.

22
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:33,581
( faint sloshing )

23
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,916
Lizzy:
Do you think Daryl's dead?

24
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,251
Carol:
<i>No.</i>

25
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:39,069
<i>He had to go far away</i>
<i>to get the medicines,</i>

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,339
<i>so it's gonna take a while.</i>

27
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:47,511
<i>We lost all our food</i>
<i>in cell block D,</i>

28
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:49,013
<i>so we're gonna go look for more</i>

29
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:51,182
<i>and whatever else we can find.</i>

30
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:58,556
Lizzy:
<i>Nobody's died yet.</i>

31
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:00,358
Yet?

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,259
I think a lot of people
are going to die.

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,928
It's what always happens.

34
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,398
Makes me sad, but...

35
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,983
at least they get to come back.

36
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:12,453
Lizzy, when they come back,
they aren't--

37
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,322
people aren't who they were.

38
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:17,074
Yeah, but they're something.

39
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,242
They're someone.

40
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:22,946
<i>I'm little now.</i>

41
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:25,916
<i>If I don't die, I'll get big.</i>

42
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,969
<i>I'll be me,</i>
<i>but I'll be different.</i>

43
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,638
<i>It's how it is.</i>

44
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,482
( coughing )

45
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,470
( grunts )

46
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,239
Lizzy:
<i>We all change.</i>

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,075
We all don't get to stay
the same way we started.

48
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,943
Lizzy, it's more
complicated--

49
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,813
You said I was weak.
I'm not.

50
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:58,649
I'm strong, so I'm telling
you what I think.

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,795
You remember what I told you
to do when there's danger?

52
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,596
Run as fast as I can.

53
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,165
You run and run
until you're safe.

54
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,889
<i>And if it's your life</i>
<i>or your sister's life,</i>

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,007
<i>you can't be afraid to kill.</i>

56
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:25,810
Understand?

57
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,478
Yes.

58
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:33,016
Carol:
<i>You are strong, Lizzy.</i>

59
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,618
<i>You're gonna live.</i>

60
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,156
<i>You, your sister,</i>

61
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,742

62
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:45,379
<i>Where's your knife?</i>

63
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,216
Put your T-shirt
behind it.

64
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,252
You've gotta be able
to get to it quickly.

65
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,753
Yes, Mom.
I mean ma'am.

66
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,805
Don't call me "Mom."

67
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,092
It was an accident.

68
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,044
Just don't.

69
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,315
Okay.

70
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,019
Carol:
<i>What is it?</i>

71
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,656
Lizzy:
I'm not afraid to kill.

72
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,358
<i>I'm just afraid.</i>

73
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,077
You can't be.

74
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:20,364
How?

75
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:21,916
You fight it.

76
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:25,703
And fight it.

77
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:27,505
You don't give up.

78
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:31,759
And then one day,

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,245
you just change.

80
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,818
We all change.

Ty!

90
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:06,029
There should be a town
a few miles south.

91
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,831
Lost a whole night.

92
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:14,938
My sister,
everybody else--

93
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,440
they're probably dead.

94
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,275
Well, it helps to keep moving.

95
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:23,546
No, it doesn't.

96
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:51,107
Maggie wanted
to come, you know.

97
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:54,778
Someone had to stay back,
watch over things.

98
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,114
Someone you trust, you mean.

99
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:07,156
They would have drowned
in their own blood.

100
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,959
They were suffering.
I made it quick.

101
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,498
We needed the bodies gone.

102
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,967
We needed to stop it
from spreading.

103
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,437
They were the only ones
who were sick.

104
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,604
They were a threat.

105
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:25,692
I was trying to save lives.

106
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:28,394
I had to try.
Somebody had to.

107
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,734
Maybe.

108
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,636
- Is that jasper?
- Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:55,972
It's a good color.
Brings out your eyes.

110
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,979
When Miss Richards went into
A block, we were leaving.

111
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,048
Asked me to keep a lookout.

112
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:08,585
I'm gonna use it
for her old man's marker.

113
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:11,821
You know all them back there?

114
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,724
You stay in one place
more than a couple hours,

115
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,659
you'd be surprised
what you pick up.

You mean Daryl and the others.

122

That's what this is, right?

123

In case they don't?

124
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,145
Until they do.
That's what this is.

00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:11,814
Medicine cabinets,
first aid kits--

126
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:13,449
anything that
could help Hershel.

127
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,919
We get in, we get out.

128
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,556
And if we can eat it,
we take it.

We were looking

The roof's broken now and it's been
getting rain, so it's full of fruit.

166
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,497
We were there about a day

167
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,715

showed up.

Killjoys, man.

Can you fix it?

180
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,694
Here, lay on your back.

181
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:43,203
<i>Okay, scooch over to the edge.</i>

182
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:46,322
<i>Just hold your arm...</i>

183
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,591
Grab ahold of this bag.

184
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:50,994
- Hold on.
- ( groaning )

185
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,630
- And keep holding on.
- ( crying ) No, that hurts.

186
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,931
Keep holding.

187
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,549
I can't, I can't.

188
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,184
Keep holding.

189
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,853
- ( bone crackles )
- ( groaning )

190
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:03,523
( man gasping )

191
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:07,360
- ( bone pops )
- ( panting )

192
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:10,864
Sit up.

193
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:15,017
Woman:
<i>Is it...</i>

194
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:18,705
Yeah.

195
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,858
It's gonna be sore
for a few days.

196
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:24,210
Rick: After the greenhouse,
you came here?

197
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,463
Yeah. We thought
it was clear.

198
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:28,548
We missed the deadie
in the PJs,

199
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,083
so we dove into the bathroom.

200
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,335
So how long were you up
there till we showed up?

201
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:34,037
Like, two days.

202
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:36,339
There was just one.
You had guns.

203
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,174
We have about 12 bullets.

204
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:39,876
It usually take us
about five or six

205
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,511
to bring one of them down.

206
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:43,012
But you have knives.

207
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,814
To what, stab it in the head?

208
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,349
Yeah.

209
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,818
We got separated from
our crew about a week ago.

210
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,554
Been trying to play it safe
since it's just the two of us.

211
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,690
- I have to with my leg.
- Yeah.

212
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,026
We were at a refugee center
together and there was a fire.

213
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:58,945
People were just
trampling over me.

214
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,447
Assholes.

215
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,415
Sam saved my life.

216
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,666
We didn't know
each other before.

217
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,586
It didn't heal right,
but it healed.

218
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:08,505
And we found each other.

219
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,957
It was worth it.

220
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,742
Where are you two headed next?

221
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:14,094
We just keep moving.

222
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:17,430
We haven't been waiting
for places to go bad.

223
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,716
I mean, it's getting
a little old.

224
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,268
You guys look all right.
What's your setup like?

225
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,437
The "skin-eaters"?

226
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:26,639
We call them walkers.

227
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:33,095
How many have you killed?

228
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,898
( door creaks )

229
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,960
Come on.

230
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,386
Here we go.

231
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:13,469
Hmm, cells look pretty dry.

232
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,471
A little distilled water
will clear that right up.

233
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,614
You should have let him go.

234
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,700
The hell you know
about it, huh?

235
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,919
- You the damn expert?
- No.

236
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,422
I just don't want
to see you die.

237
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,490
Is that what
you're trying to do?

238
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,327
Do you even know
what you're trying to do?

239
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,048
I know you're pissed.

240
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,267
And you have
every reason to be.

241
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,188
But anger makes you stupid.

242
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:52,341
Stupid gets you killed.

243
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:55,728
Aren't you still angry
about the Governor?

244
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,447
What he did?

245
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:59,732
If he was here right now,

246
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,702
I'd cut him in two.

247
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,904
'Cause that's
how it needs to be.

248
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,858
But I'm not angry.

249
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:13,496
I <i>was.</i>

250
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:16,032
Then why are you still
going out looking for him?

251
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,060
I don't know.

252
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,682
( grunting )

253
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,890
Daryl:
<i>That's puke.</i>

254
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:45,245
Those douchebags in the vines

255
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,447
took themselves out,

256
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:48,948
holding hands--

257
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:51,668
kumbaya style.

258
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,753
They wanted to go out
together same as they lived.

259
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:55,338
That make them douchebags?

260
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:58,407
It does if they
could have gotten out.

261
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:02,745
Everybody makes it,
till they don't.

262
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:05,014
People nowadays are dominoes.

263
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:08,101
What they did, maybe it's about
not having to watch them fall.

264
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:10,887
Right.

265
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:15,858
<i>( raspy breathing )</i>

266
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,193
Come on.

267
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,346
( grunts )

268
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,106
We got about all
we're gonna get here.

269
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:04,807
We should move on.

270
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:07,026
So, did we pass your test?

271
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:16,119
We're in a prison
eight miles north.

272
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,756
If you come back with us, we
can't guarantee your safety.

273
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:22,208
There's an illness, a flu.

274
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:24,293
It's bad.

275
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:25,828
We've lost a lot.

276
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,680
- <i>Kids, too.</i>
<i>- Yours?</i>

277
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,466
No, thank God.

278
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,770
But one of my girls,
she's got it.

279
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,889
- I'm sorry.
- She's strong. She'll make it.

280
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,176
Sam:
You got fences and walls?

281
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,845
- We're in.
- Yeah, whatever you need us to do.

282
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,114
For now, sit tight.

283
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:47,650
The two of us will circle
back for you before dark.

284
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:50,019
Or you could help us sweep the
rest of this neighborhood.

285
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,038
Woman: We can do that. I
can check the greenhouse,

286
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,539
see if it's clear,
bring back more fruit.

287
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,041
And I can hit
some of the houses.

288
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,692
Well, it's nice
of you to offer,

289
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,578
but your shoulder's
barely--

290
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:01,164
Sam: <i>As long as I don't put too
much weight on this arm, I'm good.</i>

291
00:21:01,165 --> 00:21:03,583
<i>- And I can still move pretty fast.</i>
<i>- I just don't think--</i>

292
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:05,868
We won't take any chances.

293
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,721
We'll look. And if it's
cake, we'll do it.

294
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:11,808
If not, we'll just roll.

295
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,727
I mean, you don't look
so good yourself, man.

296
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:16,229
Are you a righty or a lefty?

297
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,215
We'll cover more ground.

298
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:21,567
The sooner we get back...

299
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:23,069
Sam:
You can't carry us, man.

300
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,056
- It doesn't work that way.
- Please, we want to help.

301
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,752
You fire a shot,
we'll come running.

302
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:42,404
Let's meet back here
in two hours.

303
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,346
You'll need this.

304
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:57,687
You never told us about the
group you were with before.

305
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:01,124
Which one?

306
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,981
You know, when you found
me out on that road,

307
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,933
I almost kept walking.

308
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:13,536
Why is that?

309
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:15,571
<i>'Cause I was done</i>
<i>being a witness.</i>

310
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:19,075
Two times,
two different groups.

311
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,311
I was the last one standing.

312
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:26,799
<i>Like I was supposed to see
it happen over and over,</i>

313
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,801
<i>like it's some kind of curse.</i>

314
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:37,143
But, when it's just you
out there with the quiet...

315
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,297
Used to be I'd drink
a bottle of anything

316
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,182
just so I could
shut my eyes at night.

317
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:47,303
<i>Figured the prison, the people,
thought it'd be easier.</i>

318
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:51,691
The run to the big spot,
I did it for me.

319
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,475
You gotta keep busy.

320
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:56,412
No. I did it so I could
get me a bottle.

321
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,649
<i>Of anything.</i>

322
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,518
I picked it up,
I held it in my hand,

323
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,387
but I put it down.

324
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:07,323
I put it down so hard it took
the whole damn shelf with it.

325
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:09,325
That's what brought on
the walkers,

326
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,594
and that's what got
Zack killed.

327
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:18,000
That's bullshit.

328
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:24,941
Why don't you get in there
and try the engine?

329
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:27,109
It's a red and a green wire.

330
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,844
Go on. It ain't
rocket science.

331
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:38,621
Give it some gas.

332
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,495

333
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,866

<i>( car door closes )</i>

00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,876
Sasha and me picked that spot.

336
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:02,245
He took you with us.

337
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,897
There ain't no way
anybody could've known.

338
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:07,567
You ain't gonna be
standing alone,

339
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:10,253
not no more.
Let's go.

341
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,133
It's all expired
by at least a year.

342
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,736
Better to take it. Let
Herschel decide what he needs.

343
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,225
Did you think it was right?

344
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,811
Letting those kids
come back with us?

345
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:43,014
I think it was the
humane thing to do.

346
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,983
But did you think it was right?

a couple of cough drops

351

00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,254
yeah, I think you made
the right call.

356
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,589
Rick:
And if they're not?

357
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,841
Let's hope they are.

358
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,211
( softly )
Yeah.

359
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,099
Rick...

360
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:24,856
I killed two people and you
haven't said a word about it.

361
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,443
What do you want me to say?

362
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,078
It's not about what you say.

363
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,729
It's about facing reality.

364
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,582
It always comes for us
and over and over again

365
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,067
we face it so that we can live.

366
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,286
- So that <i>we</i> can live.
- That's right.

367
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,738
That's what it always
comes down to.

368
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,407
You can be a farmer, Rick.

369
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,210
You can't <i>just</i> be a farmer.

370
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,137
You're a good leader.

371
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,391
Better than I probably
gave you credit for.

372
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,861
I never murdered
two of our own.

373
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,029
Just one.

374
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:10,151
He was gonna kill me.

375
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,370
So were they.

376
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,905
They were gonna kill all of us.

377
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,107
You don't know that.

378
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,913
If you thought it would
save Judith or Carl,

379
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,416
would you have done it then or would
you have just gone back to your crops

380
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:27,802
and hoped it'd all be okay?

381
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,455
You don't have to like
what I did, Rick.

382
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:34,125
I don't.
You just accept it.

383
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,183
( wind rustling )

384
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,853
( distant can rattles )

385
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,273
Daryl: Looks like
we're getting closer.

386
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,658
Ty: The building we
want is just up ahead.

387
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,979
( creaking )

388
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:01,619
( softly )
Come on. Come on.

389
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,421
Move, move.

390
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,208
All right, let's
make this quick

391
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,661
There you go.

392
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,024
Come on.

393
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,160
Carol: Let's hit the
houses across the street.

394
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,995
Hold on.

395
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,135
How'd you put his
shoulder back before?

396
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,703
You learn that from Herschel?

397
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,557
Internet.

398
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,475
It's easier than
telling an ER nurse

399
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,678
I'd fallen down the
stairs a third time.

400
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,647
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:06,017
Don't be. Just fixed
what needed fixin'.

402
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,723
I actually convinced myself
I was happy with him.

403
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,108
Which wasn't
all that hard to do

404
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,577
considering my idea
of happiness then

405
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,895
was just not being alone.

406
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,082
Made a decent living.

407
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,067
He was charming
when he wanted to be,

408
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:28,206
especially those mornings after
he'd come home piss-drunk and...

409
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,345
Stupid.

410
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,913
Stupid.

411
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:40,418
I didn't think
I could be strong.

412
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,288
I didn't know I could.

413
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,923
I already was.

414
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,279
Why don't you say her name?

415
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,117
She's dead, Rick.

416
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:59,370
Sophia. Dead.

417
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,208
Somebody else's slideshow.

418
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,617
Some mornings I still wake up

419
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,119
half-expecting Lori
to be there.

420
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,757
Reminding me to pick
up Carl after school

421
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,094
or telling me
breakfast is ready.

422
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,182
Every Sunday she'd
make us these pancakes

423
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,036
that were just...
godawful.

424
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,471
( chuckling )

425
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:37,075
Clumps of flour
that weren't mixed in right.

426
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,310
Thing was...

427
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,530
she knew it was bad.

428
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,582
Why'd she keep at it?

429
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,985
Well...

430
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,837
she wanted us to be
the kind of family

431
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:52,256
that ate pancakes on Sunday.

432
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,955
( creaks )

433
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,414
( grunting, munching )

434
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,735
We should get back.

435
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,221
Sam's probably waiting.

436
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:50,752
Anything ending
with -cillin or -cin,

437
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:53,555
C-I-N, grab it.

438
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:55,340
We'll dissolve
the pills in the IVs,

439
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,059
put 'em right into
the bloodstream.

440
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,629
Dosage will be tricky but
considering the time we lost...

441
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,152
- How'd you do?
- Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.

442
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,187
- Everything on the list.
- What about y'all?

443
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:11,523
Yeah, we got it all.

444
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,476
Yeah. We're good.

445
00:31:14,477 --> 00:31:16,161
All right, let's roll.

446
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:36,515
( softly )
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

447
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,270
( snarling )

448
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:46,642
Michonne:
Up ahead.

449
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:49,695
( growling, snarling )

450
00:31:58,538 --> 00:32:01,490
<i>( door creaks, shuts )</i>

451
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:05,160
Hey! Door's busted.

452
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,195
Oh. Hold up.

453
00:32:08,214 --> 00:32:11,166
<i>( walkers growling )</i>

454
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:16,171
<i>( snarling )</i>

455
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:21,593
Michonne:
<i>There.</i>

456
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,725
( snarling )

457
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:39,111
( grunting )

458
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:47,786
( snarling )

459
00:32:47,787 --> 00:32:49,404
- How many?
- I can't tell.

460
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:50,405
( rumbling )

461
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:56,911
- Ty: We can take 'em. - No! They're
infected. Same as at the prison.

462
00:32:56,912 --> 00:32:59,798
We fire at 'em, get their
blood on us, breathe it in.

463
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,416
We didn't come all
this way to get sick.

464
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:03,301
How do we know the ones in
there aren't any different?

465
00:33:03,302 --> 00:33:06,688
- We don't.
- Well, it's gotta change sometime.

466
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,562
( snarling )

467
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:16,148
- ( blade rings )
- Daryl: Ready?

468
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:17,866
Ty:
Do it!

469
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,985
( growling, snarling )

470
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:21,319
( grunts )

471
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,405
( snarling )

472
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:29,911
Daryl:
Come on.

473
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:33,715
( snarling )

474
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:44,342
( tapping )

475
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:54,569
It's been too long.

476
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:57,806
We should give him
a couple more.

477
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,995
He might be fine.

478
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:07,148
He really might be.

479
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,154
But it doesn't matter...

480
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:17,292
because he's not here...
and we have to go.

481
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:30,305
It was a nice watch.

482
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,899
( snarling, growling )

483
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,617
( snarls )

484
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:50,709
- ( doorknob rattles )
- Back.

485
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,327
Don't have an exit.

486
00:34:52,328 --> 00:34:53,712
Then we make one.

487
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:58,032
Get down!
( grunts )

488
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,588
- Come on, move it!
- Jump down to the walkway below.

489
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:06,174
- Bob: <i>They're here!</i>
<i>- Let's go! Go, go. Move.</i>

490
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,852
( snarling )

491
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,113
Michonne:
<i>Bob, let it go.</i>

492
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:29,564
Let it go, man.

493
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:32,233
- ( grunting )
- Ty: <i>Just let it go.</i>

494
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:34,870
- ( snarling, growling )
- Daryl: <i>Let go of the bag, man.</i>

495
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:41,743
<i>( snarling, growling )</i>

496
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:51,386
You got no meds in your bag?

497
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:53,104
Just this?

498
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:59,161
You should have kept
walking that day.

499
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:01,596
Don't.

500
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:17,963
( grunting )

501
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:21,616
Just let it go, Daryl.

502
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:23,618
The man's made his choice.

503
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,470
<i>Nothing you can do about it.</i>

504
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:28,473
<i>Just gotta let it go.</i>

505
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,426
I didn't want to hurt nobody.

506
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:36,231
It was just for
when it gets quiet.

507
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:44,372
Take one sip. When those
meds get in our people,

508
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:48,910
I will beat your ass
into the ground.

509
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:50,695
You hear me?

510
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:18,157
( handle clicking )

511
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,860
They might have lived.

512
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:28,266
Karen and David,
they might have lived,

513
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,736
and now they're dead.

514
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:33,972
That wasn't your
decision to make.

515
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:37,376
When Tyreese finds out...

516
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,746
he'll kill you.

517
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:43,449
He damn near killed me
over nothing.

518
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,050
I can handle Tyreese.

519
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,752
When the others find out,

520
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:49,188
they won't want you there.

521
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:51,924
And if they don't make it back,

522
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:54,476
if everybody dies of this thing

523
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,845
and it's just the two of us,

524
00:37:56,846 --> 00:38:01,600
with Judith and Carl--
with my children...

525
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:08,340
I won't have you there.

526
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,476
Rick, it's me.

527
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,513
No one else has to know.

528
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:16,832
<i>I thought you were done making
decisions for everyone.</i>

529
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,519
I'm making
this decision for <i>me.</i>

530
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,757
I could have pretended that
everything was gonna be fine.

531
00:38:26,543 --> 00:38:28,727
But I didn't.

532
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:34,349
I did something.
I stepped up.

533
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,667
I had to do something.

534
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:38,937
No, you didn't.

535
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,481
If you think I'm going anywhere
without Lizzie and Mica--

536
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:53,035
If you want them to leave,
to go out there with you?

537
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:57,022
Lizzie's sick.
Mica is 10 years old.

538
00:38:57,023 --> 00:38:59,524
She can't.
( sniffles )

539
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:01,910
We'll keep them safe.

540
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,503
You're not that woman who was too
scared to be alone, not anymore.

541
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:14,339
You're gonna start over,
find others,

542
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,475
people who don't know,

543
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:19,812
and you're gonna
survive out here.

544
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:22,431
You will.

545
00:39:24,984 --> 00:39:26,985
Maybe.

546
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,562
Ty: <i>That's where I was
traveling, Highway 100.</i>

547
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:40,749
Michonne: Then it will take
about seven hours to get there.

548
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,567
<i>We're gonna need more gas.</i>

549
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:44,419
Ty:
<i>But we'll get there.</i>

550
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:49,241
- Taking Highway 100.
- I heard.

551
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,982
( door closes )

552
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:05,107
You were right,
what you said before.

553
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:07,559
About the trail going cold.

554
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:12,364
I don't need to go out anymore.

555
00:40:14,484 --> 00:40:16,201
Good.

556
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:21,106
<i>( engine starts )</i>

557
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:35,137
Take it.

558
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:49,935
Ed gave this to me
on our first anniversary.

559
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,141
Please.

560
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:05,334
I should have given it
away a long time ago.

561
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,325
<i>( engine starting )</i>

562
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:30,726
<i>âª It was a close call âª</i>

563
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:33,879

564
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,783

565
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:41,019
<i>âª And you didn't know âª</i>

566
00:41:45,074 --> 00:41:48,126
<i>âª Closing on my black eye âª</i>

567
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:53,665
<i>âª I feel safe at times âª</i>

568
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:57,753

570
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,512
