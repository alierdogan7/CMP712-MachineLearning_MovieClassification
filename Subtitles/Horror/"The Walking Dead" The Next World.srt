No,

it every day for two weeks.

Both:
Denise says this is PT.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,433
- You heard me.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,301
It's time to change
your bandage.

33
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,886

some toothpaste.

34

You're talking
about the drink, right?

45
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,181
I am, but...

46
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,902
It's not medical.

47
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,690
No, I drew a line between
the important stuff and that.

48
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,526
I just figured, if you saw it.

49
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,727
All right.

50
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,863
Anything remotely
medical is a priority.

51
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,781
And food, maybe even
food before medicine,

52
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:51,619
and gas or batteries or books for
the kids or clothes is just...

53
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:55,039
if you see it,
if it just happens to,

54
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,957
you know, be right there.

55
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
You like it, right?

56
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,511
No, I don't drink pop.

57
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,712
What the hell's pop?

58
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,847
Oh, I'm originally from Ohio.

59
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,952
Why you want it?

60
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,392
Tara was talking about it
in her sleep, I think.

61
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:18,562
Either she likes it
or she doesn't,

62
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:23,534
but if she likes it, it'd
be a really nice surprise.

63
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,786
I'm not good with
that kind of stuff,

64
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,471
and she and Heath are going
on that two-week run.

65
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,240
I just thought it'd be
a nice going-away present.

66
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,160
Just, uh, don't
go out of your way.

67
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,629
And if it gives you
any trouble...

68
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,814
I won't.

69
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,349
Okay, good, 'cause
it's not important.

70
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,467
I should've said so instead
of just drawing a line.

71
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,471
Got it.

72
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,941
(growling)

73
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:15,869
I mapped out some of the agricultural
supply places in the area.

74
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,421
Even if they've
been cleaned out,

75
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,707
my bet is that the sorghum
would be untouched.

76
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,542
Now, that there is a
criminally underrated grain

77
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:24,962
that could change the game with our food
situation from scary to hunky-dunky.

78
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,103
I'm talking standability,
drought tolerance,

79
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,390
grain-to-stover ratio
that is the envy of all corns.

80
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,778
Think about it.

81
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,898
- Thanks.
- All right.

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
Okay.

83
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,024

85
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,082
Rick: We're gonna find
food, maybe some people.

86
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,818
The law of averages
has gotta catch up.

87
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,589
Daryl: I don't know. We ain't
seen nobody for weeks.

88
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,025
Maybe we ain't gonna
find nobody.

89
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,693
Maybe that's a good thing.

90
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,870
Don't.

91
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,071
Don't.

00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,234
Hi.

156
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,927
Back up! Now!

157
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,495
Keep 'em up!

158
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,063
Whoa, easy, guys.

159
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,632
I was just running
from the dead.

160
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,867
How many?

161
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,869
10, maybe more.

162
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,487
I'm not risking it.

163
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,606
Once it gets to double
digits, I start running.

164

Daryl:
<i>Where?</i>

165
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,243
About a half a mile back.

166
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,744
They're headed this way.

167
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,380
You probably have
about 11 minutes.

168
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,388
Okay, thanks
for letting us know.

169
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,891
Yeah.

170
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,993
There's more of them
than us, right?

171
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,761
Gotta stick together.

172
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,398
Right?

173
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,806
You have a camp?

174
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,942
No.

175
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,028
Do you?

176
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,864
No.

177
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,417
Sorry for running into you.

178
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm gonna go now.

179
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,789

I hope it's good to you guys.

00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,826
I'm Rick.
This is Daryl.

181
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,011
<i>What's your name?</i>

182
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,635
Paul Rovia.

183
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,970
But my friends
used to call me Jesus.

184
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,438
Your pick.

185
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,208
You said you didn't have a camp.

186
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,210
You on your own?

187
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,678
Yeah.

188
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,948
But, still, best not
to try anything.

189
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,183
Best not to make threats
you can't keep, either.

190
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,536
Exactly.

191
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,723
- How many walkers...
- No, not this guy.

192
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,559
How many walkers
have you killed?

193
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,328
Sorry, gotta run.
You should, too.

196
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,219
He was clean.

197
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,722
His beard, it was trimmed.

198
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:03,258
There's more going on there.

199
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,842
He didn't have a gun, either.

200
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,312
We could track him,
watch him for a while,

201
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,180
get to know more.

202
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,882
See if he's really alone.

203
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,984
Maybe bring him back.

204
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,453

You think I couldn't get it?

219

Michonne:
<i>You could've.</i>

Mm.

What are you doing out here?

223
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,803
I was on guard. I saw
someone was in the woods.

224
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,938
What are you doing out here?

225
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,441
I walk after my shifts.

226
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,611
I've been doing it for a while.

227
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,746
You're the first one to notice.

228
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,918
Why the shovel?

229
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,423
I'm gonna keep walking now.

00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,626
That's okay.

232
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,299

figure out what I want...

235
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,911

236

Right now I just
want to find out

237
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,783

the woods with a shovel.

238

239

240
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,704
It got wet.

241
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,672
It's all gone.

242
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,258
Come on.

243
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,629
It doesn't look that old.

244

- Yeah?
- I mean, we can't read what they wrote,

245
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,452

they're saying something.

246

What?

247
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:38,422
"We're not alone."
(chuckles)

248

We knew that.
We saw it.

249

People died.

250
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,668
Why are we coming out here?

251
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,039
'Cause we're kids.

252
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,175
It's what they do.

253
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,128

Hey, whatever she wants.

257
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,042
She saved Carl's life.

258

We didn't know her, and she
turned out to be all right.

00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:56,469
That's bullshit, man.

365
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:58,688
Let's go check them cars,
get the hell out of here.

366
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,606
What about the guy?

367
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,074
What about him?

368
00:29:02,076 --> 00:29:03,609
Well, he helped you.

369
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,979
Maybe.

370
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:12,318
He ever pull a weapon on you?

371
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,673
Fine.

372
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,842
Let's put him up a tree.

373
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:31,570
Why are you still here?

374
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:34,807
I liked your mom a lot.

375
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,109
I really don't want you to die.

376
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:40,613
So, come on.

377
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:42,381
- Let's go home.
- My family's dead. That's not home.

378
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:44,216
It's just where I live.

379
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:45,785
It's more than that.

380
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,853
Hey, enough.

381
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,455
I'm fine.

382
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:54,827
You've got a life back there,
and maybe I will, too,

383
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:59,665
but before I can even think about that,
I need to take care of something.

384
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,207
I have to try.

385
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:09,742
So let me help you.

386
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,899
You can't.

387
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,121

<i>(growling continues)</i>

391
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,182
I thought I saw her that night.

392
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,601
I thought I did.

393
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,305
I did.

394
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,394
(growling)

395
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:23,516

396
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:40,332
(snarling stops)

397
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,868
I got her.
I got her.

398
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:02,955
So that's why I was out here.

399
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:34,513
She left me a note.

400
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:39,116
She said I still knew my way.

401
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:43,921
(chuckles)
I never knew my way.

402
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:47,592
You loved your family?

403
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:49,178
Yeah.

404
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:51,204
Then you know your way.

405
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:53,307
It's home.

406
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,110
They're gone.

407
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:02,366
I've been out here chasing
you all over the woods.

408
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:08,021
You've still got family,

409
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:09,923
and you've still got a home.

410
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,301

- Let's go.

<i>(thuds)</i>

412
00:33:49,164 --> 00:33:51,748
He took a pretty hard hit.

413
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,934
Denise needs to look him over.

414
00:33:53,936 --> 00:33:55,752
Yeah.

415
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:57,137
You wouldn't have
gone through with it.

416
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:58,372
You wouldn't have left him.

417
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,841
I would've, right up in a tree.

418
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:04,644
- I would've.
- No. I know.

419
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:07,214
Almost as soon as we got
to Alexandria, you got it.

420
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,683
You saw... you...

421
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:12,736
<i>and Michonne, Glenn,
you all tried to tell me.</i>

422
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:16,606
- So shut up.

00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:21,695
'Cause I'm finally listening.

425
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:31,238
See that bright one?

426
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,040
Yeah, that's the North Star.

427
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:37,711
It's at the end
of the Little Dipper.

428
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:40,347
Yeah.

429
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:45,719
If you get lost at night,
just find that star.

430
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,556
Hey.

431
00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:51,274
Hey.

432
00:34:53,445 --> 00:34:54,661
You have a good day?

433
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:57,397
(babbling)

434
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:59,282
I guess so.

435
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:02,035
I'm gonna take her in.

436
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:04,955
Carl.

437
00:35:13,665 --> 00:35:15,248
I saw what you did.

438
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:18,668
<i>With Deanna.</i>

439
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:26,176
Yeah?

440
00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:29,813
You should've left her
or killed her.

441
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,154
No, that's stupid.

442
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:40,106
What's stupid is you being out
there when you don't have to.

443
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,741
You did the same thing.
You didn't...

444
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,693
you and Spencer didn't have
to go out there, but you did.

445
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:46,246
- That's different.
- It's not.

446
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,498
I wasn't gonna leave her
out there like that.

447
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,950
You wouldn't.

448
00:35:49,952 --> 00:35:52,752
You wouldn't.
I know it.

449
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:54,454
I couldn't kill her.

450
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:57,040
- Why not?
- Because... be...

451
00:35:58,627 --> 00:35:59,793
You could've killed her.

452
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:01,461
No, I couldn't.
I wouldn't.

453
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:02,596
Were you playing some
sort of game out there?

454
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,130
- Did you think that...
- No!

455
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:05,298
Then why?

456
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,633
Because it should be
someone who loved her,

457
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:09,169
someone who's family,
and I... I'd do it for you.

458
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:17,894
I would.

459
00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:23,700
Come here.

460
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:30,790
Me, too.

462
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:05,025
You know, I was thinking...

463
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:06,910
back before we went
out to the quarry.

464
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:10,997
The morning after Reg and Pete.

465
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:14,618
You said we shouldn't be
looking for people no more.

466
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,286
You were right.

467
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,706
No...

468
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,374
I was wrong.

469
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:22,876
You were right.

- Sorry to wake you up.
- Who is this?

473

Come on, man, he's heavy.

474

Oh, that thing,
uh, didn't work out.

It's this asshole's fault.
Sorry.

476
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:00,297
Lay him on the bed.

477
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,464
All right, take a look at him.

478
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:03,383
He ain't staying, though.

479
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,523
We'll see.

480
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:32,278
It is pretty stupid of us
to go out there, isn't it?

481
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,114
Yep.

482
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:36,333

- Yep.
