1
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,399
Strange.

2
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,100
Who would do something like this?

3
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Maybe someone got upset about
their roaming charges.

4
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:17,100
Stealing satellite phones makes sense,
you can hawk 'em.

5
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:20,899
You can write up charges
on somebody else's account.

6
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,800
But burning them?

7
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,800
Youngsters?

8
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,700
...pulling some prank?

9
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,450
No. They would have left a note.

10
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:34,100
"Fuck you", to their parents....

11
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,899
....or the world or whatever

12
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,300
Not a bad idea though.

13
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,600
I brought Peggy here on our
first date.

14
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:06,200
Yeah, we all did.

15
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,899
Not Peggy of course.

16
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,600
I gotcha.

17
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,500
Last sunset of the month.
Always works.

18
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,500
Well, uhm, let's go to the sign.

19
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,299
You okay, Eben?

20
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah.

21
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:16,100
Why  even bother with that, nobody's
going to see it for a month.

22
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:17,567
It's condition.

23
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,799
Kind of put this off til the last
minute didn't ya?

24
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,700
There's a lot of small towns in this state.

25
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:46,299
My boss wants all this gear inspected
and certified by the 31st.

26
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah, I noticed it says barrel for the last.

27
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,400
Are you sure you don't wanna stay?

28
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,865
Me and Jane were kind of hoping...

29
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,299
that you and Eben would rethink this
separation thing.

30
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Thanks.

31
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,200
I, uh...

32
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:07,299
...gotta meet the plane.

33
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,900
Okay sweetie.  I know you can handle ????

34
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Promise I won't live on Oreos and Snapple.

35
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,799
I'm going to Seattle.

36
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,799
Yes you are Kristen,
call me when you get there.

37
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,700
You got a problem?

38
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,200
Nothing I can't handle
my fucking self.

39
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Is this for generators?

40
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,299
Yeah, yeah most.

41
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,500
Beau, I'm going to have to cite
you for it. I can't have it leaking all
over the street.

42
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,299
What?

43
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,799
For that?

44
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,600
...you don't have to cite me.

45
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,700
You don't have to do anything.

46
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Isn't that why we live out here?

47
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,100
You know, for a little freedom?

48
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,900
Happy motoring.

49
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,500
Yeah, I'll add it to my collection.

50
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,299
You know, Beau's not so bad.
Why'd you bother writing him up?

51
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,100
He lives all alone out there
on the south ridge.

52
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:28,799
A little citation now and then lets
him know he's a part of this town.

53
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,500
Eben? Come in Eben.

54
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah Helen?

55
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,799
Something bad happened to John Reese's dog.

56
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,800
[Radio] : Well folks, you're listening to KBRW,
Marrel, Alaska.

57
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:51,000
...today's the last day [fade out].

58
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,000
And we've been to get the last plane
out of here.

59
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,100
Hey Stella, are you okay?

60
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,500
????? Malachi.

61
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Didn't you know what "right of way" means?

62
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm sorry Stella.

63
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
The brakes jammed and....

64
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,200
...Eben wanted this back before
the storm hit. And I was trying to...

65
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,800
Oh shit!

66
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Was going to meet you at the airport.

67
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,900
Wouldn't Eben?

68
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,900
Well, my mom could come down and give you
a tow, but you know she don't move
too fast.

69
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Fuck, where's my phone?

70
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,450
It's me.

71
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,900
Surprise!

72
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,200
I uh, need a ride to the airport.

73
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,700
What?

74
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,500
You're in town and you didn't want to talk?

75
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,767
I had fire marshal work here,

76
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:35,000
..and I just had a little accident.

77
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm stuck on Ransom and 355 and the airport
will close, and I'll never get to Anchorage.

78
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,900
I mean, if you wanna talk,
we can do it on the drive.

79
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,000
Billy.

80
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,800
Stella's stuck at Ransom and 355.

81
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,300
She needs a ride to the airport.
Can you go get her?

82
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,500
Stella, John Reese needs me for something,
so Billy's going to come get you.

83
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,800
Let me know if the day comes
and you do wanna talk.

84
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,300
What sick jerk would do this?

85
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Every kennel, every dog we had.

86
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,100
Did you fuck with anyone recently John?

87
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,700
I'll kill them....I'll kill them.

88
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
This wasn't done long ago.

89
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,700
I'll find him.

90
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
It'll be okay Malachi.

91
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
Where have you been?

92
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
Uh, I couldn't find the damn car keys.

93
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,400
And then I was like..wait, is that like Rogers
and 355 or Ransom?

94
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah, never mind, let's go.

95
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
It would be a lot easier,
if you would just play grandma.

96
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,700
Oh, I don't really care for those sort of
games, if you want to know the truth.

97
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,300
Try your brother.

98
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,700
- Tessek?
- Eben, do you want to play?

99
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh, I can't right now Jake, I'm sorry.

100
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,700
While you were busy with John Reese,
Carter Wilson called.

101
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:59,098
about a vandalism problem at the
utilidorf.

102
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,200
Thanks.

103
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,900
You know, call Point Hope and Wainwright
and see if they have any troubles.

104
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,599
No!

105
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,200
I am not trapped here for a month.

106
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,500
There will be someone you can bunk with.

107
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,000
Uh, don't start Billy.

108
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:43,900
Peggy and me and the 2 girls in one room.

109
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,099
Place of your own.
I can't stay here..I've got bills to put and
my plants will die.

110
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
It will work out.

111
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,599
Of course the process of staying at my place...

112
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,800
...is you can explain to me and Peggy just
what is wrong between you and Eben.

113
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't have enough time this century
to cover that Billy.

114
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:33,099
Eben, how you doing?
Good to see you.

115
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,700
Boy, it's gotta be 10 below out here.

116
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
- Eben
- Wilson.

117
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:48,205
Can't your wife bring you out
a sweater or 2?

118
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:52,500
Bring the whole tribe up,
while she's at it?

119
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,400
When they're ready I guess.

120
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,800
So...

121
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,500
I found all kinds of garbage
over the years.

122
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,700
Blue jeans...bikes.

123
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,599
Sometimes I can yank them out before
the muffin monster chews them
to shit.

124
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,300
The muffin monster?

125
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:20,900
That's old Wilson's helicopter logo,
pulled that stuff out before it got
totally trashed.

126
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,800
You keep a copy of your lock and key,
don't you Wilson?

127
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,400
Yeah, I put it in dry-dock, with
tourists headed south.

128
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,099
Haven't looked at it for days.

129
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,099
They ripped out the throttle, the rotors...
half the fucking helicopter.

130
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,400
It's my life Eben!

131
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,599
Why would someone rip the hell out of
my ??????

132
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,200
Stop!

133
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,098
Stop! Stop!

134
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,000
Who are you people?

135
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
No whiskey?

136
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,000
No rum.

137
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,900
Alcohol's illegal this month.

138
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,400
Folks have a hard enough time in the dark
without booze making it worse.

139
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,300
Well forget about the liquor..

140
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,200
...Lucy.

141
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Just bring me a bowl of...

142
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,100
...raw hamburger.

143
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,000
You only get meat 2 ways around here...
frozen or burnt.

144
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,300
You don't bring me what I want to eat

145
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,100
what I want to drink.

146
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
That's enough pal, leave the lady be.

147
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,900
Hey, what do you say the 2 of us go
outside and have a little talk, huh?

148
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,500
Now what's wrong with a man
wanting a little fresh meat?

149
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,000
Come on. You and me, let's go.

150
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,565
Taking you outside.

151
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,400
I would like to see that.

152
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
I would too.

153
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,900
And Lucy would have to clean up after
Eben kicked your ass.

154
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,300
More trouble than you're worth.

155
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
Hey hey

156
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,569
That's enough.

157
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,438
Stay down.

158
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,300
Fire marshals office will take care of ????

159
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:30,200
It's a funny thing, you never asked.

160
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,700
So you missed your flight?

161
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,100
That sucks, where you gonna stay?

162
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,600
Billy and Peggy are putting me up.

163
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,900
Well, I'll talk to you sometime I guess.

164
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Hey listen, um...

165
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,500
...maybe I'll come along and say hi
to Jake and Helen.

166
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
Bye Lucy.

167
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,300
I haven't seen vandalism like this
in a long time.

168
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,900
You don't know how to take care
of this town without me.

169
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,300
Malachi totaled my car.

170
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Hell of a day.

171
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Just you wait.

172
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,900
-Where are we going?
-Headed back to your house.

173
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,600
My landlady doesn't want a bunch of
pipeline workers keeping her up all night.

174
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,600
That's right.

175
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,200
- Let's head back to my place.
- Neither of you are getting me alone.

176
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,400
Neither!

177
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,300
Share, right?
None of us have to be greedy.

178
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:23,700
Ahh, come on, we'll be good.

179
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:25,100
Oh, you will?

180
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
- Where's ????
- Oh you bad little bitch.

181
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:29,900
Okay, rock, paper, scissors.

182
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,300
Whoever wins, we go to his place.

183
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
- Good idea, do it.
-Hurry up, let's get moving.

184
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
On 3.

185
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,800
One, two..

186
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,300
Gabe?

187
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,300
Gabe?

188
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Let me tell you what I got.

189
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,700
You don't work at the refinery.

190
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,300
You didn't fly in.
Somebody would have seen you.

191
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,100
You're definitely not from around here.

192
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,800
How did you get in?

193
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,700
Alright.

194
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,800
We got a long time to figure this out.
Nobody's coming for you for a month.

195
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,200
Jake, come here a second.

196
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,900
What the hell is that?

197
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,800
Oh, it's pot.
It helps her with her cancer.

198
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,100
Didn't tell you I have a little greenhouse
at home, didn't want you arresting me.

199
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,200
Now I know why you wanted to
go live with grandma.

200
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,200
No, I just thought you and Stella would just
want some privacy.

201
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,700
It worked out.

202
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,100
Ah, computer's down.

203
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,900
I'll call Gus.

204
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,000
Strange.

205
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
The phone's down too.

206
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:47,200
Mr. and Mrs. Sheriff.

207
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,300
Soooo, sweet.

208
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,000
So...

209
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,500
...helpless against what is coming.

210
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,600
He's just trying to freak us out.

211
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,200
It's working.

212
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,500
We have more important things to
think about.

213
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,200
I'll check on Gus.

214
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,700
Check on Gus.

215
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Bar the windows.

216
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,800
Try to hide.

217
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
They're coming.

218
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,700
This time they gonna take me with them.
Honor me.

219
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah, for all that I have done.

220
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,700
They?

221
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,500
Who are they?

222
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Our generator's kicked in.

223
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,800
- I meant ????
- We have to stay here with him?

224
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,400
Sure. We'll keep an eye on him.

225
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
As soon as the lines are back up,

226
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,100
get Billy over here, stay on the walkie-talkie
with me until the power gets back.

227
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,200
Gus!

228
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,100
Gus?

229
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,400
This is sheriff Eben Olson, stay in your homes.

230
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:27,800
...lock your doors, and
load your firearms.

231
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,200
- Is your genny up and running?
- yeah.

232
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,800
Anyone with a genny should go
home immediately just to be safe.

233
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,700
If you don't have one, you should
meet at the diner.

234
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
I heard gun shots Eben.
What the hell is going on?

235
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't know.

236
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,600
Just go home, I'll let you know
when I find out, okay?

237
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,700
Let's just have dinner John.

238
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,500
Please?

239
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,700
John! John!

240
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,900
Ally!

241
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,800
No! John!

242
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,300
John!

243
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,800
Ally!

244
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,000
Ally!

245
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,300
Oh my God!!!

246
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,900
No way out of town.

247
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,850
No one to come help.

248
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:16,900
- Shut up!
- Ignore him Jake.

249
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,200
You can feel it?

250
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,300
That cold ain't the weather.
That's death approaching.

251
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,700
Who do you think they gonna
take first, hmm?

252
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,200
The girl who takes a gun, will help her?

253
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,000
A kid, a sheriff's kid?

254
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,400
Shut up!

255
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Oh, yeah.

256
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,500
Thank you for the plastic.

257
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,500
I can split it apart and pick the lock.

258
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
No it won't.

259
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,500
Jake!

260
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,000
Oh, sheriff.

261
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,700
Helen, get the first aid kit.

262
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,500
All right, time to talk!
Who are you here with?

263
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Who are you here with?!

264
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,700
Who did that to Gus?!

265
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,500
You are dead man.

266
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,100
Where are they!?!

267
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,700
I don't talk to dead men.

268
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:50,800
I DON'T TALK TO DEAD MEN!!!

269
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,200
Well if I'm dead, no one's getting loose
from here.

270
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
You're all dead!

271
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,400
I can take care of that for now, but Doc Miller should...

272
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,800
No.  Wait til the power's back, call Doc Miller then.

273
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,100
This fucker doesn't deserve anything til then.

274
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:28,699
Billy and I will work our way from the south
street to the pipeline.

275
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,500
His friends don't have many places to hide.

276
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll join you.

277
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,100
Oh I got it.

278
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,199
Only you, me and Billy are the authorities.

279
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,699
It's stupid not to take more help.

280
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,600
We got walkie talkies, we'll be fine.

281
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
There's a tazer in the back...

282
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
if he gives you any trouble....

283
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,400
...use it.  Okay?

284
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,100
You drive, I'm riding shotgun.

285
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,800
Stop the car.

286
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,199
What?

287
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,100
Stop the fucking truck!

288
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,100
I thought I saw something.

289
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,300
- Get in the truck.
- What?

290
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,800
Get in the fucking truck!

291
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,699
Jesus Christ!

292
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,000
- Holy Shit!

293
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,699
What was that?

294
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,699
Who is that?  Where was that?
Where was that?

295
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,199
No...no!

296
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,550
- Helen!
- Helen!

297
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,400
Helen! Helen, come in!

298
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:52,000
Jake?

299
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,300
Helen?

300
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,199
Are you here?

301
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,500
Oh shit.

302
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,100
They didn't take me.

303
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
Who did they take?

304
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,100
They didn't take me.

305
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Did they take my brother?

306
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,500
Finish me off.

307
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,000
Finish me off.

308
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,900
Eben.

309
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Eben, look at me.

310
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,100
No.

311
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
What are they?

312
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,200
We don't know.

313
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,600
Wilson, I wanna go home.

314
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
It's okay Dad, it's okay.

315
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,000
You keep shooting and they....

316
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,600
...they just keep coming.

317
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,600
How is that possible?

318
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I don't know.  They're all coked up on PCP
or something.

319
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,700
They don't feel any bullets.

320
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,200
They killed every sled dog in town.

321
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,500
They took Aaron and Gabe.

322
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,400
They took my grandma.

323
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,600
- Lucy, is back there alive?
- Oloft

324
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Jake?

325
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Eben!

326
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,900
Who the hell are these people Eben?

327
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,300
What do they want?

328
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,100
We'll figure that out.
We'll get you guy some place safe.

329
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,700
There's a generator at the ??????

330
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,600
No, it's way major out of town, we need
some place close to hide.

331
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Now.

332
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,700
Charlie Kelso's attic?

333
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,600
It has a pull down ladder, you
can't tell it's there.

334
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,500
He would've boarded up his home
before he left.

335
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:10,500
Which is exactly why it's a good idea.

336
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,400
We'll pull down a board to get it,
and then tack it back.

337
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Carter.

338
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I want you to stay as close to the building
as possible.

339
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,000
If you hear anything, go through a crawl
space and go strait to Kelso's attic.

340
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:27,300
I'll meet you there.

341
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
What are you gonna do?

342
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:39,800
Something's gotta slow them down.

343
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I'm coming with you.

344
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Okay.

345
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Go on, get out of here!

346
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,750
What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

347
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,500
We gotta lose this thing.

348
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:31,700
And go where?

349
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,600
We know a place.

350
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,700
Go!

351
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,800
They seem to work.

352
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Looks well hidden.

353
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,300
...the feet of grandma Helen.

354
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
Like...

355
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,700
...vampires, you know?

356
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,800
Vampires don't exist, Jake.

357
00:43:42,835 --> 00:43:45,300
They don't fall when you shoot them.

358
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,700
Well neither do I.

359
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,900
Well, I don't care what they are.
I just care what we do about them.

360
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,500
What are we gonna do about them?

361
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,000
We'll sleep in shifts.

362
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,100
We'll ration our food, and then
we'll figure out the next step.

363
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,350
We have 2 advantages...

364
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:11,900
We know this town...

365
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,000
...and we know the cold.

366
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,300
We live here for a reason...

367
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,600
...because nobody else can.

368
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, right.

369
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,800
Gondunk lesz rád.

370
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,700
I guess it's good you didn't want
kids huh?

371
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,000
Imagine...

372
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,900
Where, where's Catherine?

373
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,300
Dad, dad.

374
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,600
Mom died a long time ago.

375
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,000
Isaac...

376
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,100
You should go to sleep now.

377
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,000
That's right, that's right.

378
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,800
Go to sleep.

379
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,100
Thank you.

380
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
They're ransacking the Clark's place.

381
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
They're tearing through everyone's home.

382
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,200
We have to move!

383
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,400
When do you suggest we do that?

384
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:55,300
Now...

385
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,700
...while we have the strength.

386
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,300
Until we have some way to stop them,
it's suicide Lucy.

387
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,700
We can stay here til they find us and then....

388
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,350
and they can kill us all,, or we can
run like hell.

389
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:08,900
Now, some of us won't make it, but it's better
than all of us dying.

390
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:10,700
- Shut up.
- You should sit down.

391
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,700
So, maybe Denise or Lucy dies, but that's okay
as long as you still have a chance?

392
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,000
Hey.

393
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,800
If we start to fight, that will get us killed
a lot faster.

394
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,900
We go to the general store, and get supplies,
then we go to the utilidorm.

395
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,100
We'll never make it there without cover.

396
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,200
If we get there, we can last the month.

397
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:11,200
The next blizzard, we'll be ready.

398
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,400
Somebody!

399
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,600
Help!

400
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,300
Help!

401
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Please!

402
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,200
Anyone....

403
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
We need to get her in here
before they find her.

404
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:05,300
- Wait.
- What?

405
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,000
Look at the rooftops behind her.

406
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,500
They're using her as bait.

407
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Please!

408
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,700
Please no.

409
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,400
No, I tried.  There isn't anyone there.

410
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,400
God.

411
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,300
No God.

412
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,600
I've known Kirsten my whole life.

413
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,800
I'm going out.

414
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Why are we waiting here for Eben?

415
00:51:52,935 --> 00:51:54,400
...We can make a run
for it and give it all we got.

416
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,900
- Shhhh
- If I can kill anything, I can kill these things.

417
00:51:56,935 --> 00:51:59,000
We'll die in here otherwise.
- Eben doesn't know what he's doing!

418
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:00,400
- Just move
- Beau.

419
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,265
We agreed to ???????

420
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,200
- Just move!
- We need you here.

421
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,800
Okay, okay.

422
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,100
John.

423
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,700
How long you been under there?

424
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,200
I'm not sure.

425
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:37,800
Where's Ally?

426
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,600
They took Ally.

427
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,000
Couldn't follow.

428
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,900
You okay?

429
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,400
My leg hurts.

430
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,800
I know a safe place.

431
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,300
I'm going to pull it out.
But stay quiet.

432
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,200
Come on.

433
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,300
I'm really hungry.

434
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,800
We'll get you something to eat.

435
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,600
[Howling noise]

436
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,400
What happened here?

437
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,500
Shit.

438
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,100
Eben.

439
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,600
Carl.

440
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,200
John! Stay back!
Stay back!

441
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,400
John.

442
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,200
Are you hurt?

443
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,500
- There's blood.
- Can't breathe.

444
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm okay, I'm okay.

445
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,800
Where's your inhaler?

446
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,900
I lost it.

447
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,500
Oh, shit.

448
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,700
John Reese became one of them.

449
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,400
Isaac!

450
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,600
I'm walking to Wainwright.

451
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,800
It's 80 miles, there's no way to
get there.

452
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,500
- Go upstairs.
- Wilson.

453
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,200
Come on. We need to get out of here.
Bring your mother too.

454
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,000
- We'll die if we go out there.
- No.

455
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,700
I'll die if I stay here, that's what will happen.
Leave me alone.

456
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,200
What's he doing?

457
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,300
Just keep quiet.

458
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,900
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

459
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,400
Let's just go back upstairs.

460
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,300
Is there a bathroom?

461
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,200
Just open the valve afterwards.

462
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,800
Who would've thought we'd make it
this long, huh?

463
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,300
We're ahead of the curve.

464
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,500
Everyday they need more food,
they'll be back.

465
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,400
Dad?

466
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,700
Dad?

467
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,300
No noise.

468
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,700
- Wait, you can't just rush out there.
- He's my father!

469
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,100
No, wait!

470
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,800
Stella, you alright?  What happened?

471
00:58:16,835 --> 00:58:19,000
Isaac went to Wainwright.

472
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,300
Wilson went to find him.

473
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,000
How long have you been down here?

474
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,100
Dad!

475
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,000
Dad!

476
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,700
Dad!

477
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,000
We should've fought harder...

478
01:00:15,899 --> 01:00:17,700
...kept Wilson here.

479
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,799
It's hard to stop someone,
when their family's at stake.

480
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,299
The things you'll do to save your home.

481
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,399
We were like that once.

482
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,399
Weren't we?

483
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:16,500
Let's go on.

484
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:20,700
It's snowing.

485
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,899
As soon as it's safe, we have to move.

486
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,299
Canned goods, Stella ?????

487
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:43,100
Uh, propane, and batteries.

488
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Jake, better get supplies.
We meet back here in 2 minutes.
- Let's go.

489
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,100
My wife and I wouldn't live on these things
while she was gone.

490
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,299
I'm done playing with this one.

491
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,600
Do you wanna play with me now??

492
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:02,600
What?

493
01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:25,398
She was just a girl.

494
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,299
You did the right thing.

495
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,398
It's okay.

496
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:55,700
Who was she?

497
01:05:56,898 --> 01:05:58,398
Does anybody recognize her?

498
01:06:05,898 --> 01:06:07,500
The white-out is over.

499
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,898
We can't stay here.
But the utilidorm's too far without cover.

500
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,398
Eben?

501
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Can you make it to your station,
if someone created a diversion?

502
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,600
How?

503
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:48,299
These things can't survive the sun.

504
01:06:48,398 --> 01:06:52,100
What if we brought the sun early?

505
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,299
Helen had that operation at home.

506
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:58,299
Yeah, she used an ultraviolet light
to grow the stuff.

507
01:06:58,398 --> 01:07:00,500
We can run for her place, 
let them follow me.

508
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,000
And hit them with the sunlamp, while
the rest of you beat it to the sheriff's station.

509
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,200
Just because something stopped 
Bella Legosi, doesn't mean,

510
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:09,200
...it can stop these things.

511
01:07:09,799 --> 01:07:12,600
Why would they send that
stranger to cut us off?

512
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,898
...into the light?

513
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,600
And what if it doesn't work?

514
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:23,100
It has to.

515
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,799
I'll do it.

516
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,000
- I'm the fastest.
- Bullshit!

517
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,398
I weigh less than you, and I 
know grandma's house.

518
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,299
You've got a wife, people need you.

519
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:47,299
Jake.
I saw you in the back with the ax.

520
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,799
You think you're up to doing that
3 or 4 more times?

521
01:07:51,898 --> 01:07:54,700
You don't think this plan will work.
Yeah, but you do.

522
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,600
I'm going.

523
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,898
See you at the station.

524
01:08:02,299 --> 01:08:06,000
You'll need to start the genny first.

525
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,398
See you soon.

526
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,599
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

527
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:44,099
Hey...come on motherfuckers!!!

528
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,000
Come on!!

529
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,000
Come on Stella.

530
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,200
Are you there?

531
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,300
Yeah, yeah it worked.

532
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,599
But they're gonna cut off the power
so.....

533
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:12,300
Stella.

534
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,200
We got em.

535
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,300
Oh, it's good to hear your voice.

536
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,000
Don't wait for me.

537
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,300
Eben, run for Rogers Avenue, towards
the trencher.

538
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,400
It's my turn.

539
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,700
Fuck off!

540
01:14:22,599 --> 01:14:24,500
Open the barrel.

541
01:14:24,535 --> 01:14:26,300
Top of the world.

542
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:17,500
You ain't gonna eat me.

543
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,000
Beau

544
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,099
and Doug.

545
01:17:08,299 --> 01:17:09,799
Now there's 6 of us.

546
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,400
And then there will be just 5.

547
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,000
The little girl in the store.

548
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,299
Changed.

549
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,400
Just so thirsty now.

550
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,400
I couldn't tell you.

551
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,400
That photo is all I got left of my family.

552
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,299
Martha was taking the kids
to visit her mom.

553
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,500
They were hit....

554
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
...by a drunk driver.

555
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,700
Anna wanted to be with me so much.

556
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,299
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

557
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,400
But, I know they're waiting for me.

558
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,600
I can't live forever.

559
01:18:27,799 --> 01:18:29,200
I can't.

560
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,100
Don't let me.

561
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,100
No Carter.

562
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
He told us what he wants.

563
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,500
Do you see that?

564
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,799
Yeah.

565
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,400
It's Billy.

566
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,500
Billy.

567
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,900
It's Peggy and the girls.

568
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,200
I heard the screams.

569
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,500
I didn't want them to die like the rest.

570
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,200
I was about to shoot myself too...

571
01:21:31,235 --> 01:21:33,600
when the fucking gun jammed.

572
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,000
I shouldn't have signaled you.

573
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,700
I just couldn't stand being on my own.

574
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:05,600
You have a family.

575
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,500
You don't ever hurt them!

576
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,200
You don't ever hurt them.

577
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,799
Maybe they tried the utilidorm.

578
01:23:21,799 --> 01:23:23,000
Gail!

579
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,299
Gail!

580
01:23:29,299 --> 01:23:30,700
No, Stella!

581
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,700
I'll meet you at the utilidorm.

582
01:23:53,799 --> 01:23:55,500
No, Billy, stay there!

583
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,700
Eben!

584
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,600
Jake!

585
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,100
Stella?

586
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,200
Gail Robbins?

587
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,500
We don't know.

588
01:27:28,299 --> 01:27:31,000
Stella, this is Eben, come in.

589
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:49,299
Stella, this is Eben, come in.

590
01:29:58,934 --> 01:30:01,299
Chocolates, vitamins and vodka.

591
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,200
Stella, come in, this is Eben.

592
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,900
We should celebrate.

593
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,900
One day til sunrise.

594
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:27,200
You did good getting everybody here.

595
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,500
Eben.

596
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:40,900
Stella.

597
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,700
???? is walking around.

598
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:49,000
Just had to hear your voice.
Like you're there with me.

599
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,000
Where are you?

600
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,799
Are you okay?

601
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,700
???????

602
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,600
I'm freezing Eben.

603
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,500
I can see the car,
the rack on the right.

604
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,299
We're coming to get you.

605
01:31:21,299 --> 01:31:22,900
There's way too many of them.

606
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:26,600
They'd kill us before we got to her.

607
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,600
We have to cut off or they'll hear you.

608
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,299
I'll call you back when it's safe.

609
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,400
The sun comes up tomorrow.

610
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,400
We're going to watch it together.

611
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,600
I'm so sorry baby.

612
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,799
I should never have left you.

613
01:32:02,799 --> 01:32:04,900
The street's filling up with oil.

614
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,299
They broke into the pipeline.

615
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,600
They're burning down the town.

616
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,400
Nobody will know what happened.

617
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,799
They'll just think it was some
horrible accident.

618
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,799
Next time, they'll take out Point Hope,
Wainwright.

619
01:33:21,299 --> 01:33:22,900
Wait, wait.

620
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,600
This building's strong.
Can't we just ride it out here?

621
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,299
They'll kill her if she runs.

622
01:33:41,799 --> 01:33:44,400
She'll burn if she stays.

623
01:33:48,299 --> 01:33:51,400
If you go out there, won't they come
after all of us?

624
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,299
Oh dear God.

625
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,000
When they're all watching me...

626
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:27,799
...get on the walkie talkie.

627
01:34:29,799 --> 01:34:34,100
- And tell Stella to run for it.
- What are you talking about?

628
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,000
When John Reese and Carter changed....

629
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,100
they were only bitten, they stayed who 
they were for a while.

630
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,900
We can't fight them the way that we are.

631
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,000
Thanks, little brother.

632
01:35:02,299 --> 01:35:05,000
Take care of Stella for me.

633
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,200
- Are you fucking crazy?
- That's somebody else's blood.

634
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,299
He's one of them.

635
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,200
- How do you know?
- He won't attack us.

636
01:35:39,299 --> 01:35:42,100
- Maybe we should stop him now.
- Shut up.

637
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,500
Shut up!

638
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,299
Nobody touches him.

639
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,700
I can smell your blood.

640
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,700
You can't fight them all Eben.

641
01:37:00,799 --> 01:37:02,700
Stella, it's Jake.

642
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,900
Get out of there now. Run!

643
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,100
Go!

644
01:40:06,299 --> 01:40:08,299
What did you do to yourself?

645
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:12,400
What I had to.

646
01:40:15,299 --> 01:40:17,000
Should I go after them?

647
01:40:23,299 --> 01:40:24,799
It's almost dawn.

648
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,400
We made it.

649
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,200
The dawn.
