00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,450
Sunday, September 5th

2
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,460
A grade-school boy was on holiday down in Izu with his family.

3
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,730
He wanted to go out and play...

4
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,760
...but there was a TV show he didn't want to miss.

5
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,350
So he recorded it on the VCR in their room.

6
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,030
But the channels down there are different from Tokyo's.

7
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,020
No station there uses that channel, so it should have been blank.

8
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,410
But when he played it back at home, there was a woman on the screen.

9
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,640
You will die in one week, she said.

10
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,080
The kid stopped the tape, and then the phone rang.

11
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,770
``You saw it.''

12
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,610
And a week later, the kid died!

13
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,820
What's wrong, Tomoko?

14
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,470
Who told you that?

15
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,020
Everybody's talking about it.

16
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,470
Yoko?

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
No, not her.

18
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,850
What?

19
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
I saw a weird video the other day.

20
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,010
Where?

21
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,800
With Yoko and the rest.

22
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,930
Did all of you really go and spend the night somewhere?

23
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,030
Nothing happened!

24
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,160
But that night...

25
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,230
...Iwata found this weird video, and we all watched it.

26
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
How was it ``weird''?

27
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,700
It's hard to say.

28
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,320
Just after it ended, someone phoned us.

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,570
It was some kind of prank call.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,110
Yuck.

31
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,430
Everyone else had heard that story.

32
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,830
Today it'll be one week.

33
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,980
Come on!

34
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,530
You're just trying to scare me!

35
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,130
I had you going!

36
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,990
I don't believe you.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,550
You're so easy to fool.

38
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,230
But did you really spend the night there?

39
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,910
So what happened?

40
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,810
I'm not telling!

41
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,590
Confess!

42
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,320
It's a secret.

43
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,690
Is it true?

44
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,680
Masami!

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,180
Masami!

46
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,620
Hello?

47
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,360
She's right here.

48
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,730
Hello?

49
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Oh... Mom!

50
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,910
A friend came over.

51
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,160
OK.

52
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,820
Got it.

53
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,430
Yeah, yeah...

54
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,560
Extra innings.  They'll be late.

55
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,490
Don't scare me like that.

56
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,450
Look who's talking.  I'm going to tell everyone tomorrow.

57
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm going to the toilet.  Don't go upstairs without me.

58
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Sure.

59
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,270
There's this ``video curse'' everyone's talking about...

60
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,250
Yes.

61
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,660
Have you heard what kind of video it is?

62
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,140
Yes.

63
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,990
Don't look at the camera.

64
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,810
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
Again.

66
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,020
Have you heard what kind of video it is?

67
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,270
I heard that suddenly there's this scary woman...

68
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,360
...who says ``you will die in one week''.

69
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,230
They say if you watch late-night TV, she appears.

70
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,070
And then the phone rings.

71
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,030
Late-night TV?  What channel?

72
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,250
I heard it was on a local channel down in Izu.

73
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,030
Izu?

74
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,510
Yeah.

75
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,500
And is there really someone who died a week later?

76
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,300
No one that we know.

77
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,220
What?

78
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,010
A high school student I know told me...

79
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,390
...a girl who'd seen it died on a date with her boyfriend.

80
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,220
An accident?

81
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,310
No.  They were found dead in a parked car.

82
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,310
He'd seen the video, too.

83
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,740
It was in the paper two or three days ago.

84
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,620
Do you know what school?

85
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,810
No.  My friend heard it from a friend of hers.

86
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,200
Ms. Asakawa...

87
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,550
Yes?

88
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,270
Here.

89
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,340
Thanks.

90
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,900
About ten years ago...

91
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,620
...a pop idol killed herself, and people saw her ghost on TV.

92
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,700
Yeah, but everyone you ask about this one...

93
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,770
...talks about the Izu Peninsula.

94
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,220
Well, maybe that's where this one started.

95
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,180
Where did they see the woman whose lips went up to her ears?

96
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,910
Further west, in Gifu.

97
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,810
That was after a big traffic accident down there.

98
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,130
A big accident?

99
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,130
These stories get started when people die horrible deaths.

100
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,840
So what happened in Izu?

101
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,750
I don't know.

102
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,180
Anyway, I'm going.

103
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,930
Good night.

104
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,920
Good night.

105
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,600
Young Couple Found Dead in Car

106
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,160
A 19-year-old Tokyo boy and a 17-year-old Yokohama girl...

107
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,740
...were found dead in a car on the morning of Sept. 6...

108
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,230
Take care of it, will you?

109
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,070
Weren't you leaving early today?

110
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,720
Okazaki, will you do something for me?

111
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,540
Can you find this high school for me?

112
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,980
Sure.

113
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,790
Call me when you find it.

114
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,250
Yoichi!

115
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,590
You're changed already!

116
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,200
I put your clothes out, too.

117
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,650
We need to hurry.

118
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,810
Did Grandpa call?

119
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,650
No.

120
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,270
Why did Tomo-chan die?

121
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,760
Some strange disease, I guess.

122
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,640
Zip me up.

123
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,590
Do kids die, too?

124
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,670
Sometimes they get sick.

125
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,650
But don't talk about that at Aunt Yoshiki's, okay?  It's too hard for her.

126
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,540
Yeah.

127
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,720
Tomoko played with you, didn't she?

128
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Dad...

129
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,830
How's Big Sister?

130
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,300
She's lying down.  Better leave her alone.

131
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,060
I'll go help.

132
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Yoichi, you come sit here.

133
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,860
Reiko-chan.

134
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,660
Does anyone know why Tomoko died?

135
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,690
No, not me.

136
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,020
But the police did an autopsy!

137
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,660
But there was no evidence of a crime.

138
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,970
People don't just die like that.

139
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,250
And it's a closed coffin. Isn't that strange?

140
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,240
Yoichi...

141
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,690
You shouldn't just come in here.

142
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,940
Go downstairs.

143
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,630
Okay.

144
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,900
Go on.

145
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,670
Okay.

146
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,910
Hello?

147
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,310
It's Okazaki.

148
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,860
I found the name of the high school.

149
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,810
Seikei Academy in Yokohama.

150
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,270
Thank you.

151
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:57,280
In Loving Memory Seikei Academy

152
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,360
Excuse me...

153
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,670
Was the girl who died in the car a friend of yours, too?

154
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,870
If there's anything you know...

155
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,040
They all died the same day.

156
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,430
Yoko and Tomoko.  And Iwata, too, on his motorbike.

157
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,030
They saw the video...

158
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,470
The video?

159
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,480
Yoko told us they'd all seen this weird video...

160
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,620
When it was over, they got a phone call...

161
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,800
Tomoko saw it, too?  Where?

162
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,650
They all went and stayed over somewhere...

163
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,030
The girl who was with Tomoko when she died...

164
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,650
She went crazy.  She's in the hospital.

165
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,360
She won't go anywhere there's a TV...

166
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,680
The girl was named Tsuji Yoko.  17, in her third year at Seikei Academy.

167
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,690
The boy was Nomi Tadahiko, 19, doing a college prep year.

168
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,760
The car doors were locked.

169
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,300
I've never seen a corpse that looked like that.

170
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,870
Cause of death?

171
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,830
Unknown.  Their hearts simply stopped.

172
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,080
Drugs?

173
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,810
Nothing in the autopsy.

174
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,120
They'd just started making out, then they just died.

175
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,810
It doesn't make sense.

176
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,510
Yo-chan was at the funeral.

177
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,170
Yes.

178
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,160
He used to go upstairs and play in her room...

179
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
He did, didn't he?

180
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,810
The Photo Shop

181
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,290
I found Tomoko dead here.

182
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,290
Tomoko!

183
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,890
Izu...

184
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,720
I might be late tonight.

185
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,990
Put your supper in the microwave.  Got it?

186
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,210
OK... Mom...

187
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,090
Yeah?

188
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,890
Tomoko saw the cursed video.

189
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,780
Why did you say that?

190
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,480
Don't say anything about that at school, you hear?

191
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,350
I won't.  I'm off.

192
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,750
Monday, September 13th

193
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,730
Izu Parkway

194
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,210
This is crazy!

195
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,850
Izu Pacific Land

196
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,830
``My dad's fat.  My mom's fat.  So I'm fat, too.''

197
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,810
You're here alone?

198
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,290
Yeah, I'm doing a bit of work.

199
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,720
Umm...

200
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,290
These four people stayed here on August 29th.

201
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,890
Did you notice anything unusual?

202
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,280
Just a minute, okay?  August 29th...

203
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,130
That tape...

204
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,510
That one.

205
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,810
What is it?

206
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,340
This one?

207
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,040
Someone must have left it.

208
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,620
ERUPTION

209
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,930
Sada

210
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,050
One week!

211
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,170
Tuesday, September 14th

212
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,840
So Yoichi's in school?

213
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,350
First grade.

214
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,900
So how are you, Ryuji?

215
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,170
Same as always.

216
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,170
What are you doing?

217
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,160
Teaching at a university.

218
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,970
So then there was a phone call?

219
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,220
Yes.

220
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,110
So this phone will ring after I see it?

221
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,960
Four people died, all on the same day!

222
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,110
Go to a shrine and get exorcised.

223
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,910
Take my picture.

224
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,920
Face this way.

225
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,610
Hurry up and take it!

226
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,210
It's over.

227
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,000
No phone call.

228
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,930
Copy this for me.  I'll take a good look at it.

229
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,650
It's not certain death yet.

230
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,260
It's a video.  Someone made it.

231
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,810
I'll check who stayed there.  Also for pirate broadcasts.

232
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,070
Wednesday, September 15th

233
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,200
From the Izu bureau.

234
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,300
Thanks!

235
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,650
Why do you want that list of customers?

236
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,280
Sorry...

237
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,480
I just need to check something by myself.

238
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,230
Was it you?

239
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,660
Did you do this?

240
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,750
Sorry I'm late.

241
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,660
What's wrong?

242
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,920
Nothing.

243
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,720
Well?

244
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,350
No one I phoned took a tape to the cabin.

245
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,520
And they all sounded normal, not like they'd make a tape like this.

246
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,660
Pirate stations?

247
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,480
There's no record of an illegal broadcast anywhere in Izu.

248
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,610
Here's the copy.

249
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,220
Asakawa...

250
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,930
Have you ever seen this woman?

251
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,440
No.

252
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,010
This shot is weird.

253
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,190
From that angle, the cameraman should appear in the mirror.

254
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,230
What do you mean?

255
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,360
Well, you could fix it with special effects, but...

256
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,860
``Eruption''...

257
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,990
Which eruption?

258
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,920
You can't read it on a regular home TV...

259
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,060
Come in.

260
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,850
Takano... A student of mine.

261
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,150
Asakawa.  My ex-wife.

262
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,410
How do you do?  I'm Takano.

263
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm Asakawa.

264
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,340
Sensei, the publisher wants your essay.

265
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,550
Why did they tell you that?

266
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,950
They couldn't find you.

267
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,240
Ask them to extend the deadline a week.

268
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,250
Me?  Ask them yourself!

269
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,290
Okay, okay...

270
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,860
No good...

271
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,820
``Sa...da...''

272
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,490
Is Yoichi all right alone?

273
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,720
He's used to it.

274
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,040
Whoever did this left a sign subconsciously.

275
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,650
He wants to be stopped.

276
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,100
Wait.

277
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,110
``Frolic in brine, goblins be thine.''

278
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,270
It sounds like some sort of dialect.

279
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,550
What does it mean?

280
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,050
I'll check tomorrow.

281
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,800
...who says ``you will die in one week''.

282
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,560
They say if you watch late night TV, she appears.

283
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,550
And then the phone rings.

284
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,380
Thursday, September 16th

285
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,710
I heard it was on a local channel down in Izu.

286
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,140
Hello?

287
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,650
I found it.  As I thought, it is a dialect.

288
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,240
It's something about ``brine'' and ``goblins''.

289
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,640
A dialect from where?

290
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,270
Oshima Island.  The volcano there.

291
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,860
Hello, Yoichi?

292
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,330
I'll be late tonight.

293
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:51,870
Yeah.

294
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,360
You're okay alone?

295
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,780
I'm sorry.

296
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,740
Mt. Miharayama Erupts

297
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,740
Here... but it's a long time ago.

298
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,930
Did Local Woman Predict Eruption?

299
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:48,900
What is it?

300
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,580
Do you have an Oshima Bureau?

301
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,570
I think so.  A correspondent.

302
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,970
Get me the number. Tonight.

303
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,400
Why?

304
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,040
You only have four days left.

305
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,550
I'll handle it with your correspondent.

306
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,000
You stay with Yoichi.

307
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,110
Grandpa!

308
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,890
Well, hello...

309
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Friday, September 17th

310
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,190
Yoichi wants to go fishing with his Grandpa.

311
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,850
Oh, is that so?

312
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,520
C'mon, let's go!

313
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,350
Let's go out and go fishing!

314
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,120
Yeah!

315
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,650
Grandpa!  You've got one!

316
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,510
Aww, he got away!

317
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,830
You're not very good at this!

318
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,300
Okay, let's try it again.

319
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,640
Let's fish over here this time.

320
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,610
All right.

321
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,080
You're home...

322
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,350
Hello?

323
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,470
Your man on Oshima says...

324
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,850
...our woman is probably the one who predicted the eruption.

325
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,710
Her name was Yamamura Shizuko.

326
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,480
She threw herself into the volcano 40 years ago.

327
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,350
What do we do now?

328
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,700
Go down there, I guess.

329
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,210
I'll go tomorrow.

330
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,210
Oshima?  But I only have three days left!

331
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,910
I know.  I have four.

332
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,870
I'll call again.

333
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,230
Is something wrong?

334
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,550
No, just some work.

335
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,340
Auntie...

336
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,840
Yoichi?

337
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,460
Yoichi!  Did you bring that?!

338
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,010
You did, didn't you?  Why?!

339
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,470
Tomo-chan...

340
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,860
Tomo-chan told me to.

341
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,200
I was careless.

342
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,590
I sensed something at your place.

343
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,530
I thought it was the video.

344
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,260
It was Tomo-chan.

345
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,420
She's not Tomoko anymore.

346
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,140
Yoichi can see her, too, then.

347
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,120
It's all my fault, isn't it?

348
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:11,420
It should have ended with Tomoko and the others.

349
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,900
I wonder...

350
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,040
Who did the story start with?

351
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,740
Stories like that don't start with anyone.

352
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,440
People feel anxious, and rumors start flying.

353
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,020
Anxious?

354
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:32,470
Or people start them, hoping things will turn out like this.

355
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,320
Mr. Hayatsu?

356
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:03,000
Hello.  Sorry you've had to come all the way out here.

357
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,050
This way.

358
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,540
Saturday, September 18th

359
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,650
The Yamamuras...

360
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,630
...used to run big fishing crews here.

361
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,440
They're all but out of the business now.

362
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,710
Shizuko's cousin is still alive.

363
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,750
His son and daughter-in-law run an inn.

364
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,110
I've booked you into there for the night.

365
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,050
Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit suicide?

366
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,490
They say she went crazy.

367
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,850
The papers had written some things about her.

368
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,290
She was famous all over the island after she predicted the eruption.

369
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,450
It had always been said that she had strange powers.

370
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,050
She was what they call a seer.

371
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,350
