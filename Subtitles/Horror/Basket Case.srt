1
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,627
Who's there?

2
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:45,607
- Glens Falls Police Department.
- This is Dr. Lifflander. I want ...

3
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,277
Hello?  Can you send
someone to ...? Hello hello.

4
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,363
Oh God!

5
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:43,587
Oh, God ... no!
No!

6
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:52,432
I've got a gun!

7
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,820
I'll shoot!
Get out or I'll shoot!

8
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:03,505
Smoke, smoke I've got joints in bags,
leaves and dime bag, gold Colombian smoke.

9
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:07,221
I've got acid, blanche, rainbow,
wonder paint, speeds, downs,

10
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,784
Seconal, Valium,
mescaline, THC,

11
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:15,149
I've got some good cocaine,
peyote, cannabis, grass, angel dust,

12
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,904
Check it out man!
Tranquilizers, amphetamines, white,

13
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:22,391
ecstasy, methadone,
marijuana, morphine ...

14
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,380
What do you want? Some girls?
I've got some nice girls.

15
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,347
What the fuck is wrong
with you anyway, man?

16
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,644
I sold it to Dirty Lou.
You remember him.

17
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:48,917
He looks like Smuggle in the comics.

18
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:52,861
Dirty Lou ...
The name sounds so familiar.

19
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,584
Wait a minute ...
Didn't he get run over?

20
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:58,259
It was suicide. He hailed a cab
and when it pulled up to the kerb,

21
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,715
he jumped in front of it.

22
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,024
Get out of here!
You're full of crap!

23
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,532
Company ...

24
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:05,829
I'd like a room.

25
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:08,702
- For how long?
- I'm not sure ...

26
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:12,032
A couple of hours?   A couple
of years?  What?  Give me a hint.

27
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:14,337
- A few days.
- Are you by yourself?

28
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:16,267
Yes, alone, by myself.

29
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,699
All alone in this
cold, cruel world ...

30
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:24,392
20 bucks a night.
In advance ...

31
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:27,333
And if you pay by the
day, it's due at noon.

32
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:31,394
And I don't want no junkies in here,
cause this is a respectable hotel.

33
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,075
I just need a place to stay.

34
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:37,018
- What's in the basket?
- Clothes.

35
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:40,901
He's smoking thru' a case of booze.
He's going to throw us a party!

36
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:47,360
- Room 7, third floor.
- Great!

37
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:49,668
20 bucks.

38
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:51,769
Oh, right.

39
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,514
- Is this stuff real?
- Hmm.

40
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:24,456
- Did you see that? He's loaded!
- So are you.

41
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:35,728
Hi, I'm Josephine.
What room are you in?

42
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,030
- Seven.
- Oh, you're so lucky!

43
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,147
That's the best room in the place!

44
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:43,747
It was lived in by a little old lady
who only went out on Sundays.

45
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:46,638
She lived there for ages.
Used to tell everyone she was rich

46
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,964
on oil well in Texas.
Had millions ...

47
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,089
and was hiding from her relatives
who were trying to steal it from her.

48
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:57,027
She'd creep up to you and say:
"They try to take my money,"

49
00:06:57,232 --> 00:07:00,912
"... But don't know where I am!"

50
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:03,064
Everyone thought she was nuts.

51
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:07,432
Then one day, she appeared in the
lobby, dressed with pearls and jewels.

52
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:09,547
Said she was leaving
to tour the world.

53
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:13,138
She paid her bill and left.
No one heard from her since.

54
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,249
We're here.

55
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,926
Is there any place I can get
something to eat around here?

56
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,249
- Nothing too fancy, I hope.
- No, just pizza or burgers.

57
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,505
- Yeah, there're plenty ...
- There's one right across the street.

58
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:58,898
Great, thanks.

59
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,037
Got you something to eat.

60
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,952
Take your time!
There's plenty.

61
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:05,740
<i> PATIENT: DUANE BRADLEY
MD. H.Needleman and J.Kutter</i>

62
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,754
Finished already?

63
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:35,559
Damn!
Kutter's name isn't listed.

64
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,845
Well, Needleman must
have the number.

65
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,307
You're not going to pace
the floor all night are you?

66
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:33,239
No. I don't want to talk now.
Go back to sleep!

67
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:40,103
Oh, come on!
I got to get up early.

68
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,274
We've been through
this before, you know.

69
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,496
Look, I'm not going to
stay up half the night talking.

70
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:53,334
It's 3:30 in the morning.
Go back to sleep!

71
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,951
I'm not going to debate this!
Now good night!

72
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:15,870
For Christ sake!
Shut up and let me get some sleep!

73
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:20,955
Always waste time to
start a conversation.

74
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:25,342
Oh, great!

75
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:29,722
Last week you were in the dumb
waiter, this week it's keyholes!

76
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:32,240
- There's somebody in there.
- I figured that!

77
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:34,775
You should see ... he's got a
roll of bills in them.  Like this.

78
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,214
Oh, give me a break!

79
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:38,977
He's kind of letting him run
loose ... in his pocket!

80
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:42,770
You've got two seconds before
I start pounding on his door.

81
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,361
- No, wait ...
- One ..

82
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:45,662
I'm going!

83
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:49,935
Keyhole peekers,
cockroaches as big as dogs,

84
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,778
saxophones playing at
4 o'clock in the morning

85
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,469
and that crazy broad across the hall,

86
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:59,900
who I know is pissing on
my door step, I mean ...!

87
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:07,680
Just a minute!

88
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,962
Hi, I live across the hall and ...

89
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,577
Well, the reason I'm bothering is ...

90
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:22,260
now I don't want you think I go
around butting into people's business

91
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,520
but somebody has been
snooping around your door,

92
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,538
you know, peeking
through the keyhole and shit.

93
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:29,699
So, if you have anything of value
in there, like money or something,

94
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,812
I wouldn't leave it laying around.

95
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,556
Right, sure.

96
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:36,297
You know I can't stand to
see somebody get ripped off.

97
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:39,693
Especially without a fighting
chance.  My name is Casey.

98
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,821
- Duane Bradley.
- Nice meeting you, Duane Bradley.

99
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,663
What the hell are
you doing in this dump?

100
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:47,393
It was the first hotel I came to.

101
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:50,453
Obviously, a hard man to
please. Where are you from?

102
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,011
Upstate.

103
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,313
- Oh, first time in New York?
- Yeah.

104
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:56,193
Listen, we have to go
for a drink some time.

105
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,765
- Okay, sure.
- Catch you later kid. Bye.

106
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:19,795
Come one. We gotta pay a little
visit to a doctor friend of mine.

107
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,126
Now the drugstore said he never
should have prescribed it to me

108
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:05,366
in the first place.

109
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,310
It's the wrong drug!
I'm allergic to it!

110
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,220
That's terrible!
Does he know you're allergic?

111
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:14,560
Well, he should. It's the second time
he gave me the wrong prescription.

112
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,623
The first time was
just as bad!

113
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:18,579
Oh, my goodness!

114
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,457
I'll be right with you.
It's this typewriter.

115
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,253
It was terrible!

116
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,632
First I got dizzy,

117
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,913
then I couldn't breathe

118
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:30,683
then my throat
felt like it was on fire!

119
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:33,969
Well, you make sure and
tell all this to the doctor.

120
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,934
Okay, this is the one!

121
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:47,592
Hear that?

122
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:50,815
Sounds like
something grinding inside.

123
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,893
And the carriage won't return.

124
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:58,055
Yesterday it was squeaking,
like if a mouse was caught inside.

125
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:01,361
Real high-pitched, like ...

126
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:07,625
I don't know anything about typewriters.
I just want to see the doctor.

127
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,735
Oh, my goodness, I'm sorry!
I just assumed ...

128
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,934
Oh, I didn't think you were a patient.

129
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,704
I'm expecting someone to fix
the typewriter this afternoon,

130
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:22,297
and I just thought, I figured that
was your toolbox or something.

131
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:25,392
Dr. Needleman is an
old friend of the family.

132
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,942
Is there any chance I could
see him without an appointment?

133
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:31,779
He'll tell you no,
friend of the family or not!

134
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:36,295
But as you can see, we have hundreds
of patients waiting to see him.

135
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:38,963
So we'll just pretend you did call

136
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:42,500
and have an appointment
for ... 11:30 ...

137
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:45,777
You're next!

138
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:47,184
Thanks!

139
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:48,533
What's your name?

140
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:49,893
Duane Bradley.

141
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,576
Oh, but don't write that ...!

142
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:56,136
I want to surprise him, and he'd
recognize that name right away.

143
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:59,620
Put down something like ... Smith,
Duane Smith.

144
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:03,339
He'll appreciate this.
He's a million laughs.

145
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:06,676
Okay and you fill out the rest.

146
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:21,032
What's in the basket?
Easter eggs?

147
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:31,059
Just visiting New York or ...?

148
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:33,334
Yes, this is my first time.

149
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:37,000
So have you gone to the Empire State
Building yet and the Statue of Liberty?

150
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,682
No, I haven't had time.

151
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,820
Haven't had the time?

152
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:43,936
What about the Radio City
Music Hall? Or the UN?

153
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:47,699
- Had time for them?
- No, I ...

154
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:51,181
What about the World Trade Towers?
Or the Trolley-cars?

155
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:53,778
- It's not that I don't want to, but ...
- The Met?

156
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:55,580
The Cloisters?
Grummans Chinese?

157
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:58,339
It's just that I don't
know where anything is.

158
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:02,580
Oh, if you need a Tour Guide
I'd be happy to volunteer ...

159
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:09,913
Or even buy you some 3D postcards
and an "I Love New York" T-shirt.

160
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:14,696
You're next!

161
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,743
Come in.

162
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,613
Yes, sir ...

163
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,317
Smith.

164
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:33,989
Smith.

165
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,560
All right.

166
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:41,099
Mr. Smith ...
What seems to be the problem?

167
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:44,742
My chest.
I've got this pain and ...

168
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:47,419
Well, why not you put
whatever that is down,

169
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:51,439
take off your shirt,
step in there and see.

170
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:35,294
So, what did he give you?
48 hours to live?

171
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:37,744
No. We just had a nice chat.

172
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:42,879
- Was he surprised?
- Oh, yeah. Very.

173
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:46,700
Anyway. Coming back to what
we were talking about before,

174
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,496
I get off here tonight at 7:00.

175
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,334
Feeling keen?

176
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:54,778
Well, I'd like to ...

177
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:58,384
... But I can't.
Not tonight.

178
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:03,181
Can't say I didn't try.

179
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,564
- Can I call you tomorrow?
- 233-3000.

180
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,697
He doesn't have hours on Wednesday.
I have the whole day free.

181
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:22,493
- Where do you live?
- I'll write it down.

182
00:21:23,864 --> 00:21:26,415
It's all the way downtown.

183
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,579
Why are we whispering?

184
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:32,558
- I don't want him to hear.
- Who? Does the doctor?

185
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:33,934
I'll see you later.

186
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,258
Lifflander.

187
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:28,515
Not now.
Not yet.

188
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:33,505
Save it.

189
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:47,468
- That was delicious.
- So are you.

190
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:49,456
Come on, have some more!

191
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:52,306
No, really.
I've had enough.

192
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,660
Nonsense!
We're just beginning.

193
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:58,944
Listen, if I have any more,
I won't be liable to ...

194
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:03,095
That's alright, I like you drunk.
You're cute when you slobber.

195
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:06,595
Shit!

196
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,079
Excuse me for a minute, love.

197
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:22,306
Dr. Kutter speaking.

198
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:25,224
- This is Needleman.
- Who?

199
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:31,098
Harold, I thought I made it clear,
you weren't to call me again, ever.

200
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:34,139
You remember Lifflander?
From Glens Falls?

201
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:37,202
Well, a few days ago he left a
message on my answering service

202
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,042
that I was to get in touch with him.

203
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,105
- So?
- So ...

204
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:47,084
So today, a young man comes to see me,
about 20 years old, using a phony name,

205
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,633
and nothing's wrong with him,
except he's from Glens Falls

206
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:52,508
and he has a deep scar
running down his right side.

207
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,135
Please Harold, I'm in
the middle of dinner.

208
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:56,776
But what he said about Lifflander?

209
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,270
I've been trying to get
him and I get no answer.

210
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:01,248
And this kid says it's
because Lifflander is dead!

211
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:03,620
Murdered!
Cut in half!

212
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:07,795
Calm down now, Harold
and pay attention. Ready?

213
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:10,467
Neither of us know any Dr. Lifflander

214
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,105
and neither of us have
ever been in Glens Falls.

215
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:17,396
But one of us wants to get
back to her dinner. Good night!

216
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:24,185
Sorry about that Cuddles.
Now, where were we?

217
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:06,378
Are you leaving now
or should I lock up?

218
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:11,820
No, I'll be a while, but ...
go and lock up anyway.

219
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,717
Okay.
See you on Thursday.

220
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:14,242
She just left.
He's in there alone.

221
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,983
Don't forget the adress book.

222
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,982
Hurry up.
I'll be outside.

223
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,987
Did you get his address book?

224
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:32,124
Great!

225
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:37,004
Kutter is listed.  He's got
her address.  We're in luck.

226
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:08,401
I brought you some goodies.

227
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,124
But first, breakfast.

228
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,927
I also got you a surprise.
But don't look till I'm ready.

229
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,749
I don't see any reason why
you need to come with me today.

230
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,224
I'm just going to case
Kutter's apartment.

231
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:45,258
I gotta find out if she's home
or when she'll be back.

232
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:48,444
Maybe I can find
out where she works.

233
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:49,923
It's going to be dull.

234
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,103
So I figured you'd have
a better time here ...

235
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,219
... with this!

236
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,598
Great, huh?

237
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,549
Got it on 14th Street.
Even has a guarantee.

238
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,138
Listen, I don't know
how long I'll be,

239
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,300
but if you get tired of watching
TV, I also got you the paper.

240
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:15,699
See you later!

241
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:14,125
I got to get these boots off.
My feet are killing me!

242
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,379
That was a rare thrill!

243
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,129
Every time the wind blew,
I thought I was going to collapse.

244
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,759
Listen ...

245
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,750
Don't get mad or anything, but ...

246
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:31,809
I really don't want to see the city.
I just said that as an excuse to see you.

247
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,370
You're not mad?

248
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:34,949
You dummy!

249
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:40,006
I suggested we tour this city for the
same reason you went along with it.

250
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,820
I wanted to be with you too.

251
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:47,597
- You did?
- Duane!

252
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,460
I know an awful lot of guys, Duane,

253
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,320
but you're ...

254
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:55,019
... different.

255
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,460
Don't you have girls upstate?

256
00:35:57,951 --> 00:36:01,568
Well, I keep pretty
much to myself.

257
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:04,827
You're a dying breed, Duane.

258
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:16,485
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Sounds like an animal.

259
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:18,741
- Why don't you check it out, man?
- It's wrecking up the place, man.

260
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:20,748
Alright now, check it out!

261
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:26,869
In here!
In here!

262
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:48,110
What the hell is going on up there?

263
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:49,744
Come!  Let's go!

264
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:57,222
I trying to get some sleep, but
that guy above me, he's gone crazy!

265
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,181
I know, I know.

266
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,306
I gotta get some sleep!

267
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:15,803
Get out of the way, will you!
Come on, let me through!

268
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:17,500
Get out of the way!

269
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:21,431
In here!
In here!

270
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,131
Come on,
back up, please.

271
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:25,762
Back off!
Move back! Huh.

272
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:37,469
What the hell going on here?

273
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:40,105
Looks like a God damn
bomb hit this place!

274
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,744
Where is the kid?

275
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,304
He went out earlier today.

276
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,469
Well, no one came out of here,
I've been standing here all the time.

277
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:50,082
All the while it was being wrecked.
Someone's got to be in here!

278
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:53,409
Unless they climbed out the window,
because this just doesn't make any sense.

279
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:57,261
- These things couldn't get
thrown around by themselves...
- Come on, out, out.

280
00:38:57,472 --> 00:39:00,418
I heard them screaming, they couldn't
have gotten out without me seeing them.

281
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,884
I mean, I was the first one here and
I've been leaning right against the door

282
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:03,985
and no one came out.

283
00:39:04,104 --> 00:39:06,452
Which means they're still in
here.   Somewhere in here.

284
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,084
Well, whoever was in
here, he ain't here now.

285
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:09,290
But that's impossible!

286
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,094
- Oh really. You see anybody?
- There is something wrong in here.

287
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:13,964
- I know there is something!
- Come on.  Donovan! Donovan!

288
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:16,629
Come on Donovan! Come on.
Let's go! Break it up.

289
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:18,905
I don't want anybody
congregating around the hallway.

290
00:39:18,912 --> 00:39:21,687
Come on, get back to your room.
There's nothing here to see any more.

291
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:25,014
Come on!  Go back to your rooms!
Come on, move it!

292
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:26,349
Come on O'Donovan.

293
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:30,791
No, I'm going to my room.
I'm going to lie down for a while.

294
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,862
All right, everybody!
Come on, break it up!

295
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:36,102
Get out of here, let's go.  Come on, guys.
Back to your room.  Please, let's go.

296
00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:38,985
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

297
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:42,872
Look, if this happens again ...

298
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:45,707
I don't know.
What do I know?

299
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:48,471
I only rent the place.  Why
should anybody tell me anything?

300
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:52,101
I don't know nothing.  Why should
I know everything?  No reason for it.

301
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:18,825
Duane, are you all right?

302
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:24,494
Move it!

303
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:33,946
Got to get back.

304
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:38,401
Duane, wait!
Duane!

305
00:41:38,593 --> 00:41:41,805
Down here!  Please hurry.
I don't know what's going on!

306
00:42:11,513 --> 00:42:13,424
Oh, God!

307
00:42:27,513 --> 00:42:30,744
Alright, clear the lobby.
Come on.

308
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:34,189
- Come on, Marlin, outside. Let's go!
- What happened?

309
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,407
Someone killed O'Donovan
and ripped him to pieces.

310
00:42:36,414 --> 00:42:39,533
- They just carried him away.
- But the culprit was scaring everyone.

311
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:41,392
- You can't come in here!
- But I only want ...

312
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,031
Get out of here!

313
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,872
- You heard what they said?
He killed O'Donovan!
- Who?

314
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:49,429
I don't want him kill you!

315
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:57,142
Thanks.  You've been very helpful.
We'll probably have more questions ...

316
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:08,946
Would you hold it a minute?

317
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:12,428
- Do you live here?
- Yes

318
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:14,452
- What's your name?
- Duane Bradley.

319
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:16,988
- How long you been out, Duane?
- Since this morning.

320
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:21,233
- Do you have pets? Any animals in there?
- No, nothing.  Why?

321
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:22,248
Oh, one of your neighbors,

322
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:25,259
a Mr Brian Mickey O'Donovan
was murdered a few hours ago.

323
00:43:25,294 --> 00:43:27,230
And we're just questioning
everybody in the building.

324
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:29,470
- Mind if we come in?
- No.

325
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:43,279
Duane, right before the murder,

326
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,370
some of the tenants claim to have
heard noises coming from this room.

327
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,914
Like someone on a rampage.

328
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:53,750
- Any idea who it was?
- No, I don't know.  I was out.

329
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:56,973
What happened?

330
00:43:57,474 --> 00:44:00,925
That was an accident.  It happened last
night.  We went out for burgers, and ...

331
00:44:01,134 --> 00:44:02,362
We?

332
00:44:02,554 --> 00:44:04,949
No, me.  Just me.

333
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:08,733
And you don't own any pets?
No dogs or anything?

334
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:10,034
No.

335
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:14,183
What's in the basket?

336
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:23,462
Nothing ...

337
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,446
Duane, where are you from?

338
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:31,878
Upstate.  Glens Falls.  Upstate.

339
00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:39,707
Do you always leave
money lying around like that?

340
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:45,664
Uh, must have
fallen off the dresser.

341
00:44:45,874 --> 00:44:49,384
- And you've been out all day?
- Yes, since about 9:00.

342
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:52,113
- Alone or ...?
- With someone.

343
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:56,520
If you have to prove where you were
and who you're with, would you be able to?

344
00:44:56,555 --> 00:44:58,048
Sure.

345
00:45:00,194 --> 00:45:03,193
- How long you going to be staying here?
- A few days.

346
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:05,847
If I wanted to come back again
and look around, will that be alright?

347
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:07,314
Sure.

348
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:14,652
Okay, Mr. Bradley.
Thank you very much.

349
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:17,212
Listen, if you think of
anything that may help us,

350
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,722
I'd appreciate you
getting in touch with us.

351
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:21,566
Okay, sure.

352
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:55,731
Are you crazy?
You could have us arrested!

353
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:59,631
No, no. You can't blame this on me.
I didn't know he would break you.

354
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:00,964
What?

355
00:46:01,514 --> 00:46:03,705
Wait a minute.
Hold it!

356
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:06,565
All right, all right.

357
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:10,064
Okay yes, I was with a girl.

358
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:12,105
Yes, the receptionist.

359
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,503
Yes, I lied.

360
00:46:17,795 --> 00:46:20,668
No, I didn't go to Dr. Kutters.

361
00:46:20,675 --> 00:46:23,708
I knew if I told you, you'd get mad.

362
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:27,784
But I didn't do anything, she just
showed me around, that's all.

363
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:33,369
I'm not deserting you!
I just want some time for myself.

364
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:37,345
Look. I've helped you with
everything so far, haven't I?

365
00:46:37,355 --> 00:46:39,047
Killing Lifflander, was your idea.

366
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:42,052
Coming to New York to get
the other two, was your idea.

367
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:45,711
Now wait a minute!
Let me finish!

368
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:48,606
I'm not saying that!

369
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:53,904
Of course you're right.
They deserve what they get.

370
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:58,493
All I'm saying, it's been your
idea every step of the way.

371
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:01,307
But I've helped you, haven't I?

372
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:07,763
Never desert you, not after all
we've been through, you know that.

373
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:11,231
We'll always be together.

374
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,923
What the hell are you doing here?

375
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:49,510
Wait, no, don't tell me.
It's the first bar you came in, right?

376
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,367
Hi, Casey!

377
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:57,810
You really doing New York in style.
First the broad and now this place.

378
00:47:57,811 --> 00:48:00,834
- Aw, you come here often?
- I don't even drink!

379
00:48:00,835 --> 00:48:05,065
That's obvious.  You're not still
upset about this afternoon, are you?

380
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:07,053
That isn't half of it ...

381
00:48:07,055 --> 00:48:09,954
I'm so messed up
about a lot of things.

382
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:15,305
And now this girl I have met ...
I don't know what's going on anymore.

383
00:48:17,056 --> 00:48:19,517
Tell you what.
Why don't you and that ...

384
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,531
... picnic basket of yours,
join me at the back table?

385
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,364
I've got some heavy boozing to do

386
00:48:24,365 --> 00:48:27,198
and looks like you can use
some good company.  Come on.

387
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:46,925
Now tell me ...
What do you do in Glens Falls?

388
00:48:46,936 --> 00:48:49,152
- I'm a sorter.
- A sort of what?

389
00:48:49,156 --> 00:48:51,866
No, a letter sorter.
I sort mail.

390
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:53,935
You're a mailman?

391
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:02,069
That's great!

392
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:06,874
There is something else
I've been dying to ask you ...

393
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:11,287
What's in the basket?

394
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:14,511
- My brother.
- Your brother!

395
00:49:17,836 --> 00:49:20,254
What is it?
A midget?

396
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:24,153
No, we're twins!
Siamese Twins!

397
00:49:24,316 --> 00:49:27,974
That's funny, you don't look oriental!

398
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:32,231
So what happened?
So bad it shrink him?

399
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:35,015
No, he is deformed!

400
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:40,274
A freak!
He looks like a squashed octopus!

401
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:46,791
Our mother died giving birth to us.
He was attached to my right side.

402
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:50,436
They wouldn't let us go to school
or anything.  They kept us hidden.

403
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:56,035
We were the big family secret.
Everyone hated us, except our aunt.

404
00:49:56,176 --> 00:49:58,142
Listen, he likes the dark,

405
00:49:58,143 --> 00:50:01,530
he doesn't like to be seen,
not even by me, sometimes.

406
00:50:01,534 --> 00:50:02,646
And you know what else?

407
00:50:02,677 --> 00:50:05,405
He talks to me, up
here, without words.

408
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:07,328
I just hear him
whispering in my brain.

409
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:10,109
Sometimes he talks for
hours, he won't shut up!

410
00:50:10,116 --> 00:50:12,437
I used to be able to
talk to him like that,

411
00:50:12,438 --> 00:50:14,717
but that's when we
were still connected.

412
00:50:14,752 --> 00:50:17,384
Our aunt said it
was our special gift,

413
00:50:17,385 --> 00:50:20,396
but since we have been
separated, I can't do it anymore.

414
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:24,524
But he can still do it to me,
in fact, he's even better at it now.

415
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:28,472
- He always knows what I'm thinking.
- Duane, you're giving me the creeps.

416
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:30,368
They didn't want him to live!

417
00:50:30,376 --> 00:50:34,725
But he fooled them.  He
didn't die, he just got stronger.

418
00:50:35,896 --> 00:50:38,230
Oh, if you only knew
what it was like.

419
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:40,917
So in the end, I kept
him from everyone.

420
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,546
Well, both of us are messed up!

421
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:47,108
I don't know which
one of us is worse ...

422
00:50:47,703 --> 00:50:49,090
Duane.

423
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:50,919
Duane!

424
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:57,326
No, no, God no!   I don't
even want it in the house!

425
00:50:57,337 --> 00:51:01,315
It should be dead instead of my wife!
How could you let it be born?

426
00:51:01,316 --> 00:51:04,376
Why didn't kill it
before it killed her?

427
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:08,674
And then, after they
tell me, my wife died,

428
00:51:08,676 --> 00:51:11,905
after they tell me my child
is a twisted block of flesh

429
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:14,733
then she tells me
I need two names for it.

430
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:16,984
One for the child and
one for the monster!

431
00:51:16,985 --> 00:51:19,898
As if I had two sons
instead of one freak!

432
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:22,021
It killed its own mother!

433
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:28,753
You want a name for it, I will
name him "killer".  A murderer!

434
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:35,389
The boy is how old now?
Twelve?

435
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:38,355
You mean "boys".
There are two of them.

436
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:41,935
Boys ...
Yes, of course.

437
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:45,650
They're upstairs.

438
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:49,765
And just how long have you
actually tutored the child?

439
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:53,013
Children.  I've been with
them since they were born.

440
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:57,126
As their aunt, I'm sure you're
doing what you think best.

441
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:01,034
I've got a copy of
your teaching certificate

442
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,077
as well as the
school board's report.

443
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:07,628
However the state does have final say
and I must examine the boy for myself

444
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:10,656
before any tutoring can
replace proper schooling.

445
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:13,132
Now you do understand?

446
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,589
Now, if I may be
blunt, can't they ...

447
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:20,327
Couldn't they have an operation?

448
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:23,013
It's not that simple.

449
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:46,396
I think we should
discuss this downstairs.

450
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:52,612
<i> No, no.  I think we're
making a big mistake.</i>

451
00:52:52,617 --> 00:52:54,853
<i>We're rushing things.
We shouldn't even be here.</i>

452
00:52:54,857 --> 00:52:55,841
<i>Where is boy now?</i>

453
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:58,039
<i>He's upstairs, in bed, asleep.
He can't hear us.</i>

454
00:52:58,057 --> 00:53:00,769
<i>We need time to think
this over, talk it over ...</i>

455
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:04,652
<i>We don't have time.  It must be done
now, while my sister-in-law is away.</i>

456
00:53:04,653 --> 00:53:06,804
<i>I'm not sure.
I've got second thoughts.</i>

457
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:07,905
<i>Bullshit second thoughts.</i>

458
00:53:07,956 --> 00:53:10,791
<i>I've had 12 years of
doctors' second thoughts.</i>

459
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:12,633
<i>I not know ...
I just don't know.</i>

460
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:16,247
<i>Well, you'll sure as hell know if it were
your own son we were talking about!</i>

461
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:20,212
<i> You understand that if we separate the
deformity from Duane, it will probably die?</i>

462
00:53:20,218 --> 00:53:23,196
It's better off dead!  What kind
of life will it have the way it is?

463
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:25,673
- We're talking about your child!
- Child?

464
00:53:25,678 --> 00:53:28,796
Duane is my child,
not that other thing!

465
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:30,757
All I want is Duane to be normal.

466
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:33,689
It's too late to change the
other one, just cut Duane from it.

467
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:35,694
I don't know.
I don't know!

468
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:39,083
The hospital says no, every
doctor I've asked says no ...

469
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:41,575
You two may be my last hope!

470
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:45,373
I don't know who you are, or where
Lifflander found you and I don't care.

471
00:53:45,378 --> 00:53:47,933
No questions asked.
Just separate them.

472
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:51,494
He's right of course.  The boy
should have a chance of a normal life.

473
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:54,749
They don't share organs or
bones, just tissue and flesh.

474
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:58,892
If the operation is successful, the
most Duane will have is a nasty scar.

475
00:53:58,898 --> 00:54:00,873
- And the other one?
- Doctor ...

476
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:03,758
I'm not even sure it's human.

477
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:09,193
No, God no!
Help help!  No!

478
00:54:09,198 --> 00:54:11,436
Stop fighting, God damn it!

479
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:14,254
We're just going into the
dining room, Duane.  Now stop it!

480
00:54:14,258 --> 00:54:17,667
It won't hurt, Duane.
I promise, this won't hurt!

481
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:21,893
Duane, hold still!

482
00:54:22,658 --> 00:54:24,257
Don't fight it ...

483
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:26,618
- We're only trying to help you.
- This is for your own good.

484
00:54:26,653 --> 00:54:29,536
- Now, we've got to hold you still.
- Duane, God dammit!

485
00:54:29,578 --> 00:54:31,858
- Hold his arms.
- No, help!  God, no!

486
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,931
Damn it!
It's for your own good!

487
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,423
No, God!
No, help!

488
00:54:36,758 --> 00:54:39,777
Hold him, hold him, that's it.

489
00:54:43,138 --> 00:54:45,055
Damn it!  If it is squirming around,

490
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:46,356
this is not going to work,
if it's squirming around.

491
00:54:46,378 --> 00:54:49,450
- Hold him still!
- Hold him.  Hold him ...

492
00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:54,434
- Look, I've got it ...
- Okay, hold him.

493
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:44,417
Is that you, Belial?

494
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:46,992
Where?

495
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:49,558
I'm coming.

496
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,935
God damn it, Duane!   If that's you
down there, you'd better answer me!

497
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:35,353
Duane?

498
01:01:18,701 --> 01:01:20,998
It's all right now.

499
01:01:22,021 --> 01:01:25,233
Everyone's gone,
the police have left.

500
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:29,876
They could find no evidence
of who killed your father,

501
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:32,794
nor do they have
any idea what killed him.

502
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:37,592
Dr. Lifflander said that he performed
an emergency operation on your brother

503
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:42,152
and that he died and was
removed from your side.

504
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,893
I am not going to ask
you what really happened.

505
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,899
I know that you and your
brother have gone through hell.

506
01:01:49,901 --> 01:01:54,481
Everyone thinks Belial is dead now
and we'll let them.  It's safer that way.

507
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:58,535
But I'm here now to
care of you.  Both of you.

508
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:15,314
- Aren't thou afraid?
- No, monster.  Not I.

509
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:18,089
Be not afraid.
The isle is full of noises,

510
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,173
sounds, and sweet airs
that give delight and hurt not.

511
01:02:21,381 --> 01:02:25,561
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears,

512
01:02:25,562 --> 01:02:26,969
and sometimes voices,

513
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:31,251
that if I then had waked after long
sleep, will make me sleep again.

514
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:32,653
And then in dreaming,

515
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:36,834
the clouds we thought would open and
show riches ready to drop upon me.

516
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:41,279
That when I awake,
I cried to dream again.

517
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:23,020
Hey, that's your room.

518
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,179
- Yeah, but you're going home first.
- No, you first.

519
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:27,716
All right.

520
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:32,136
Now, yours.

521
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,697
- I'm okay, really.
- Yeah, I know.  Give me your key.

522
01:03:34,698 --> 01:03:37,140
I can do it myself.

523
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:40,700
I'm fine.

524
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:43,977
- Really, I'm really okay ...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
01:03:47,822 --> 01:03:50,013
See?
I'm all right.

526
01:03:50,022 --> 01:03:51,850
Are you sure?

527
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:55,901
- A hundred percent.
- Okay, baby.

528
01:04:54,343 --> 01:04:56,673
Almost forgot him.

529
01:07:56,643 --> 01:07:58,212
Help!

530
01:08:04,535 --> 01:08:06,380
Help!

531
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:12,420
There's something in my room!

532
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:15,955
- Move out!
- I saw it, I saw it!

533
01:08:15,984 --> 01:08:18,153
He tried to kill me!

534
01:08:18,983 --> 01:08:22,036
Just head ...
There's nothing else!

535
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:25,897
That thing is in my room!

536
01:08:48,744 --> 01:08:51,074
I want you to stay with me tonight.

537
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:54,096
You can sleep on my couch.
Are you okay, honey?

538
01:09:11,343 --> 01:09:14,604
- Whatever was in there, is gone.
- No!

539
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:17,654
It's alright, you can
stay with me tonight.

540
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:23,739
All right!   Get back to
your rooms!  Come on!

541
01:09:23,944 --> 01:09:26,999
This ain't a God
damned subway station!

542
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,438
Move it!
Come on!

543
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:34,339
Clear the hallway!

544
01:10:11,264 --> 01:10:14,662
This isn't a hotel, it's a nuthouse!

545
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:53,618
Come on, let's get this over with.

546
01:11:08,445 --> 01:11:12,440
This is a vet.
An animal doctor!

547
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:25,979
Mr. White?

548
01:11:32,865 --> 01:11:35,818
It's the last door at
the end of the hall.

549
01:11:39,584 --> 01:11:40,912
So.

550
01:11:40,924 --> 01:11:44,235
Tell me about your cat.   You
said on the phone he's badly cut.

551
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:46,340
- Yes, on his side.
- Okay.

552
01:11:46,341 --> 01:11:48,596
Let's take him into the next room.

553
01:11:54,305 --> 01:11:56,861
Just sit him there on the table.

554
01:12:01,545 --> 01:12:04,643
Well then.
Let's take a look at him.

555
01:12:04,645 --> 01:12:06,976
- Only it's not a cat.
- I thought you said ...

556
01:12:06,985 --> 01:12:10,494
And I think I should explain how
he got his cut before you see him.

557
01:12:10,505 --> 01:12:13,777
Another vet, Dr. Lifflander,

558
01:12:13,785 --> 01:12:17,361
operated on him
upstate unsuccessfully.

559
01:12:17,385 --> 01:12:19,562
Dr. Lifflander?

560
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,122
Yes, you know him?

561
01:12:22,306 --> 01:12:25,145
Ahh yes, I see.

562
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:27,495
I'm beginning to understand now.

563
01:12:27,505 --> 01:12:31,254
You're that kid Needleman
warned me about.  The Bradley boy.

564
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:33,615
The freak we separated.

565
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:36,578
What a pleasant surprise
after all these years!

566
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:40,061
You seem to have gone through
a great deal of trouble to find me.

567
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,778
The question is, why?

568
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:43,762
I would assume it's to thank me?

569
01:12:43,765 --> 01:12:45,054
To thank you?

570
01:12:45,065 --> 01:12:48,018
Well, after all I made
you normal, didn't I?

571
01:12:48,025 --> 01:12:50,261
You did it to kill my brother!

572
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:53,377
Oh, dear ...
Hostility?

573
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:56,782
You've got two seconds to
haul your ass out of my office!

574
01:12:56,785 --> 01:13:00,595
I'm not going to be threatened by some
adolescent punk with a smoldering grudge,

575
01:13:00,606 --> 01:13:03,897
unless you've got something
else you want to cut off.

576
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,595
What's in the basket?

577
01:13:57,786 --> 01:13:59,021
Doctor?

578
01:13:59,122 --> 01:14:01,022
Dr. Kutter, are you all right?

579
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,585
Open the door!

580
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:04,385
Dr. Kutter!

581
01:14:34,606 --> 01:14:35,906
Doctor?

582
01:14:35,907 --> 01:14:38,846
Dr. Kutter!
Are you all right in there?

583
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:41,365
Dr. Kutter!
Open the door!

584
01:14:41,466 --> 01:14:42,966
Dr. Kutter!

585
01:15:11,706 --> 01:15:13,284
Duane!

586
01:15:14,864 --> 01:15:16,485
Duane!

587
01:15:20,386 --> 01:15:22,577
Oh, God, Duane!
Something awful has happened!

588
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:23,801
What?
Tell me.

589
01:15:23,802 --> 01:15:25,579
I've been with the
police all morning.

590
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,547
- The police?
- Dr. Needleman's been murdered.

591
01:15:28,548 --> 01:15:30,981
They found his body
some time last night.

592
01:15:31,007 --> 01:15:34,267
- They don't think that you ...?
- Oh, no!  Of course not!

593
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:37,618
It's so awful!
I'm still shaky ... I

594
01:15:37,627 --> 01:15:42,139
I mean ... I didn't like the man,
but God, Duane, someone killing him.

595
01:15:42,147 --> 01:15:44,623
I am a wreck ... I

596
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:50,177
I need to be with someone.
I don't want to be alone.

597
01:15:52,266 --> 01:15:54,996
I want to be with you, Duane.

598
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:02,065
I don't know why.

599
01:16:02,066 --> 01:16:05,559
Especially after the way you
acted yesterday, but I just ...

600
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,197
You are the first
person I thought of.

601
01:16:08,227 --> 01:16:11,419
The only person I thought of!

602
01:16:13,267 --> 01:16:15,186
Please don't cry.

603
01:16:15,347 --> 01:16:17,421
It's alright, really.

604
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,440
Come on upstairs.

605
01:16:28,767 --> 01:16:30,780
Well Duane, it was awful!

606
01:16:30,781 --> 01:16:33,153
They wanted me to identify the body,

607
01:16:33,154 --> 01:16:35,508
even though they saw
how bad I was taking it.

608
01:16:35,543 --> 01:16:38,615
I don't understand why
I'm just upset.  I just am.

609
01:16:38,616 --> 01:16:41,420
And don't know why
I've been thinking of you.

610
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:43,519
But it's all I did.

611
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,956
I've been thinking of you all day.

612
01:16:47,347 --> 01:16:49,378
Oh, God, Duane!

613
01:17:56,728 --> 01:17:58,827
Take me, Duane.

614
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:00,456
Oh, God!
What's that?

615
01:18:00,568 --> 01:18:02,820
Duane, let me up.
Let me up.

616
01:18:03,268 --> 01:18:06,207
Duane, let me up!
Let me up!

617
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:07,708
Duane!

618
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:10,868
Duane, let me up!

619
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:13,442
Duane, let go!

620
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:41,225
Duane, open up!
What's happening in there?

621
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:42,203
Duane!

622
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:43,873
Duane, open up!

623
01:18:44,228 --> 01:18:47,142
What are you trying to do to me?

624
01:18:47,143 --> 01:18:50,308
<i>Let me in!
Are you alright?</i>

625
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:53,137
- Go away!
- Duane, let me in!

626
01:18:53,988 --> 01:18:55,860
Duane, let me in!

627
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:57,721
It'll never work!

628
01:18:58,068 --> 01:19:00,899
Damn you!

629
01:19:01,128 --> 01:19:03,229
Duane, talk to me, please.

630
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:06,500
Damn you!

631
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,085
Why?

632
01:19:25,236 --> 01:19:28,049
Duane!

633
01:26:55,691 --> 01:26:57,550
No, never again!

634
01:26:57,559 --> 01:27:00,818
She was good!
She was pure!

635
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,905
She wasn't one of them!

636
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,456
Why her?

637
01:27:04,462 --> 01:27:07,915
Because I loved her?
Because she loved me?

638
01:27:07,924 --> 01:27:10,033
What's wrong with you?

639
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,762
No!  I'll never let you out!
No way!

640
01:27:13,781 --> 01:27:16,433
No, I won't have it!
No!

641
01:27:16,534 --> 01:27:19,740
Just because you can't
doesn't mean I shouldn't!

642
01:27:19,741 --> 01:27:23,026
No!  God damn you!
Damn you to hell!

643
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:26,553
Is this what I have to worry
about every time I find a girl I like?

644
01:27:26,554 --> 01:27:28,346
You climbing on top of her.

645
01:27:28,381 --> 01:27:33,009
If I ever get my hands on you, I'll
kill you!  I swear to God, I'll kill you!

646
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:36,110
The first girl I ever kissed
and you destroy her!

647
01:27:36,163 --> 01:27:38,104
Why did you do that to me?

648
01:27:40,138 --> 01:27:40,854
Damn you!

649
01:27:42,117 --> 01:27:43,699
Duane, what's the matter?

650
01:27:43,734 --> 01:27:45,275
Get out of here!

651
01:28:03,188 --> 01:28:05,692
No ... !

652
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,491
Jesus Christ!

653
01:28:25,816 --> 01:28:27,866
.... bulging biceps.

654
01:28:35,736 --> 01:28:36,925
Oh! What's that?

655
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:40,544
Oh girls, look at that!
What is that?  Oh, no!

656
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:46,877
- Hey, there's a guy up there!
- No!

657
01:28:49,545 --> 01:28:51,939
Hey!
Are you okay up there?

658
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:07,020
Hang on, he's going to
fall on one of you people!

659
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:20,281
Oh, no!

660
01:29:25,514 --> 01:29:27,550
Don't touch him.
