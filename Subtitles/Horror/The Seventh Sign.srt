1
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,440
The fish are dead!

2
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,959
The truck. Please, Mr. Huberty.
Quickly, come on.

3
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
What do you know about Baal-Dahar?

4
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,440
Baal-Da-what?

5
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,799
l was in Jerusalem for a symposium.
Why am l here?

6
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,600
Baal-Dahar`s an Arab village.
lt`s rumoured to be a terrorist base.

7
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,359
l should say "was."
This morning we found it destroyed.

8
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,320
What does that have to do with me?

9
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,640
lt`s how it was destroyed.
That`s where we need your help.

10
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,200
My help? l know nothing about terrorists.
l think you`ve made a terrible mistake.

11
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,640
Please, come with me.

12
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,000
You don`t understand. l`m the wrong man.
l can`t help you. l`m a meteorologist!

13
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,399
We know.
That`s why we brought you here.

14
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,119
You see that...

15
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,640
...was Baal-Dahar.

16
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,679
Yesterday, a kibbutz nearby was attacked.

17
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:12,920
They threw a petrol bomb into the school.
Thirty-four children burned to death.

18
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,679
We tracked the terrorists back to here
and found this.

19
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,160
lt`s incredible.

20
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,760
-Can you explain it?
-lt cannot be explained.

21
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,720
-l have clearance.
-You damn well better.

22
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,160
The Vatican.

23
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,040
l`m sorry...

24
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,720
...Father Lucci.

25
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,760
Can you explain it?

26
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,440
With the proper equipment, l think--

27
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,880
l don`t think so.

28
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,839
They`ll never explain it.

29
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,839
lt`ll melt in a day or a week
and they`ll forget it.

30
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,600
They`ll call it a freak, an aberration.

31
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,760
You don`t think it is.

32
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,920
l would, Colonel, except this kind of thing
happened here once before.

33
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Baal-Dahar has been here for 3,000 years.

34
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,200
But you see, Baal-Dahar was built
on the ruins of an older place.

35
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,799
A much older place.

36
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:26,079
And it too was destroyed.
But you wouldn`t want that to explain this.

37
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,480
Why is that?

38
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:32,200
Because that place that was destroyed
was called Sodom.

39
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,160
Destroyed by the wrath of God.

40
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,359
How`s he doing?

41
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,320
l have to tell you, he`s still a boy.

42
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,839
-ls he kicking a lot?
-He`s very active. Moves all over the place.

43
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,040
That`s great. We`re getting
some good soccer in our last trimester.

44
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,119
l can`t wait. Two months to go.

45
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,040
l want to see you next week.

46
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,079
l`m not completely happy with his growth.

47
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,159
And your amniotic fluid
is a little less than normal.

48
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,799
But you said he`s doing fine.

49
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,760
He is. There`s nothing
to be alarmed about.

50
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,799
But l can`t say definitely that
we won`t run into the same problem again.

51
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,799
l know this time it`ll be okay.
l`ve been eating really well and resting.

52
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,400
That`s good.
So l`ll see you both next week.

53
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,359
"...have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord

54
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:01,440
"He has trampled out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

55
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:05,320
"He has loosed his fateful lightning
Of his terrible swift sword

56
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,280
"His truth is marching on"

57
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,000
They`re so adorable.

58
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,719
Would you like to see
the computer room now?

59
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,760
At the Oaks we start them early.

60
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,359
So your husband is a lawyer...

61
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,280
...and you restore fine arts
for the Hirshenson Collection.

62
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,080
-And the baby`s due...?
-February 29th.

63
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:33,960
-lt`s leap year.
-Of course.

64
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,520
l notice you didn`t write anything under
"Religious Denomination."

65
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,000
Do you mind if l ask why?

66
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,159
Because l don`t have any.
ls that a problem?

67
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,840
No, no. l just don`t like blanks.

68
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,640
Hi, baby dog.

69
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,640
Ace, be careful. Good boy.

70
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,159
Hello?

71
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,159
Well, let`s see.

72
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,280
lt`s $650, utilities included.

73
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,520
lt`s a garage apartment.

74
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,960
No, no problems with the fumes.
We park our car outside.

75
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,760
lt`s partially furnished. There`s a bed
and a table right now, but that`s about it.

76
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,080
l see. Well, okay. Sorry.

77
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,159
Hi, sweetness.

78
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,479
Tragedy continues to strike
around the globe...

79
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:00,640
...as the changing
weather patterns continue.

80
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,400
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

81
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,280
-That`s nice.
-Thanks.

82
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,200
How did it go today?

83
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,520
The State Supreme Court
denied my appeal.

84
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,679
-Are you kidding?
-l couldn`t believe it.

85
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,119
-l thought you had such a strong appeal.
-So did l.

86
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,840
So did l.

87
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,760
The whole petition was based on the fact
that Jimmy`s trial lawyer was incompetent.

88
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,799
l`ve told you that. l thought l proved it.

89
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Shit. What are you going to do?

90
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,599
Appeal again. Fight it.

91
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,239
Anyway, how`s our bouncing baby boy?

92
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,200
Good. We had a good day.

93
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,159
Good.

94
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,719
l know we talked about it
and decided not to...

95
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,880
...but l went to the Oaks today
and put down a deposit.

96
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,599
lt only puts us on the waiting list
for four years.

97
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,280
Why are you doing this?

98
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,799
l just want to be prepared.

99
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,719
l want you to be realistic.

100
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,359
-l am realistic.
-We don`t know for sure if the baby--

101
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,039
l saw Dr. lnness today.
She said l`m doing perfect. No problems.

102
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,719
Really?

103
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,719
This baby is going to be fine.

104
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,039
lt has to be.

105
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,200
lt has to be? What if it isn`t? Then what?

106
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,000
l just don`t want to lose you, that`s all.

107
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,320
Okay?

108
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,719
Okay.

109
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,440
Will you die for Him?

110
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,320
Will you die for Him?

111
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,400
What is it?

112
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,640
What`s the matter?

113
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,599
l was in these rooms.

114
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,280
Oh, God, l could feel it coming.

115
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Death.

116
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,080
lt was just a dream, Abby.
lt was just a dream.

117
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,239
lt`s all right.

118
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,520
lt was just a dream.

119
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,159
Russell Quinn?

120
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,039
Penny Washburn. Sorry l`m late.

121
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,440
l understand you`re quite an expert
on death sentence appeals.

122
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,440
So they say.

123
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,280
What do you know about this case?

124
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,400
So far, not much.
The kid murdered his parents?

125
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,359
He poured gasoline on them and
set them on fire while they were sleeping.

126
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,119
l take it this is not someone
with a lot of remorse.

127
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,119
His parents were brother and sister.

128
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,559
"Executed for the word of God"
is what he said in his signed confession.

129
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,119
Jimmy....

130
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,479
-How`s it going?
-Hello, Russell.

131
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,479
This is Penny Washburn.
She`s going to help us with your case.

132
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,199
-Hello, Penny.
-Hello.

133
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,400
-Can we talk a minute?
-Yes.

134
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,280
Penny`s going to help me
prepare a new appeal...

135
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,160
...but we`ll need your help.

136
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,079
l told you, l do not go to hospital.

137
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,640
l can`t help you unless you let me.

138
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,760
Just talk to her,
tell her what happened, that`s all.

139
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,640
No hospital.

140
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Jimmy, this is important.

141
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,680
lf you go to the hospital,
the doctors may find you incompetent.

142
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,400
Then the court will reconsider your case.
Otherwise, we don`t have anything.

143
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,599
l know what is right
and l know what is wrong.

144
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,680
l did nothing wrong.

145
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,079
You admitted killing your parents.

146
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,439
lt was not wrong. lt was the law of God.

147
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,280
Leviticus.

148
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,079
lsn`t murder a crime too,
in the eyes of God?

149
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,680
lt is not murder to punish the guilty.

150
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,280
lncest may be against the law of God...

151
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
...but it`s the law of California
that we`re dealing with.

152
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,839
They`ve sentenced you to the gas chamber!
Do you want to die?

153
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,839
No.

154
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:46,000
Then go to the hospital and let the doctors
see if you knew what you were doing.

155
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,719
That says l did a crime!
That it was wrong!

156
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,079
lf it`ll save your life, say you`re wrong!
What is it going to matter?

157
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,839
lt matters to God!

158
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,680
No hospital.

159
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,359
Goodbye, Penny.

160
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,400
Jimmy, think about it. Please.

161
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,599
-Hello.
-Hi.

162
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,119
My name is David.

163
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
David Bannen.

164
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,959
l`m here about the apartment.

165
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,640
Please, come in.

166
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
Ace, get down! He usually doesn`t do this.
Go on, get down.

167
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,239
lt`s okay. Hi, Ace.

168
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,959
Get down!

169
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,880
l`m surprised. He never does this.
l`ll go get the keys.

170
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,880
Would you like a towel? You`re soaked.

171
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,599
lt`s terrible out there, isn`t it?

172
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,239
Yes, it is.

173
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,920
lf l can just find these keys.

174
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,479
Where are you from?

175
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,920
All over. l`ve moved around a lot.

176
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,520
-Because of work?
-Yes.

177
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,199
What do you do?

178
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,880
l`m a teacher. Ancient languages.

179
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,199
Over at the university?

180
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:59,680
l`ve been travelling for some time.

181
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,680
l`ve really just come back to town.

182
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,439
May l have some water?

183
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,520
Sure. Let me get you a glass.

184
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,839
-Use the bottled water, it`s better.
-Thanks.

185
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,359
Your baby is due in February.

186
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,479
The 29th.

187
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,719
How did you know?

188
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,000
l saw your calendar.

189
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,359
lt`s kind of nice.
There isn`t a 29th except leap year.

190
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,839
Makes it special somehow.

191
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,439
lt is a special day.

192
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,079
l am getting so absent-minded.

193
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,239
l hope you`re not expecting
something fancy.

194
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,319
This is it.

195
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,719
lt`s a bit small.

196
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,119
l don`t need much room.

197
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:26,280
l`d like it.

198
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,000
-lf that`s all right.
-That`s great!

199
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,520
l`ll discuss it with my husband,
but l`m sure it won`t be a problem.

200
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,079
Call me tomorrow and l`ll let you know.

201
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
-Fine.
-We`ll talk then.

202
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,479
l do hope this will work out.

203
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,400
l hope so, too.

204
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,040
l`m back.

205
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,160
That didn`t take very long.

206
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:58,920
He didn`t need much help.
About all he had was a suitcase.

207
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,079
But he did have
first and last month`s rent in cash.

208
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,160
Did you ask him to dinner?

209
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,319
l did. He said, "No, thanks."
Of course, he didn`t use so many words.

210
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,000
The guy is out there.
He`s a little bit different.

211
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,319
l don`t know, l think he`s just quiet.

212
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:22,439
He`s quiet all right.
He doesn`t have a stereo or a television.

213
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
He doesn`t even want a telephone.

214
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
Really? That`s weird.

215
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,400
What`s weird is that
he has a short-wave radio.

216
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,680
You think he`s a spy?

217
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,199
The spearhead of an invasion force
that will take over and bore us to death!

218
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,359
You`re such a nut. Toss that up.

219
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:43,680
-Where are you going?
-l`m sure you did a great job inviting him.

220
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,520
Looks tossed to me.

221
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:20,880
-Jesus, you scared me to death.
-You snuck up on me!

222
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,599
l was trying not to scare you.
What are you doing?

223
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:26,040
Look at this. lsn`t this wild?

224
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,439
Yeah, it is strange.

225
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,239
David`s in the house.
He changed his mind about dinner.

226
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,000
Maybe he`d change it again
if he saw you snooping.

227
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,640
l`m not snooping.

228
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,640
l`m looking.

229
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,760
So after all that,
the senator wouldn`t even see me.

230
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,599
This poor kid will die in the gas chamber
and l get this aide who tells me...

231
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,280
...he doesn`t think their involvement
is appropriate.

232
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,359
Why?

233
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,520
Because he`s a politician.

234
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,479
He won`t get involved in anything
that could come back and bite his fat ass.

235
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:03,920
-lt`s typical.
-lt`s typical bullshit.

236
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,239
What would you do?

237
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,040
Me? What do you mean?

238
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,719
Would you stop it?

239
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,239
Of course l would, but l have no control.
l can`t do anything.

240
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,520
Maybe you can.

241
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,079
She can`t do anything, David.

242
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:25,160
That`s what l`m saying, nobody listens
anymore. l`m the kid`s attorney...

243
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:28,359
...and they won`t listen to me.
So they won`t listen to Abby.

244
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,000
Maybe you are right.

245
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,719
lt`s not up to us.

246
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,719
-How about dessert?
-Please.

247
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,760
Jesus Christ! Look at this!

248
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,479
Get a broom.

249
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,719
Please don`t!

250
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,680
l wasn`t going to hurt it.

251
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,479
l`m sorry.

252
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,560
That was weird.

253
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,239
Do you know...

254
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,959
...there`s a story about a new-born child
and the sparrow`s song.

255
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,920
lt`s ancient.

256
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,760
Hebrew.

257
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,359
They believed that in Heaven...

258
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,280
...God`s mansion has many halls.

259
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,160
And that one of these halls
is the Hall of Souls.

260
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,560
lt`s called The Guf.

261
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
"The Guf"?

262
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,839
They say whenever a baby is born...

263
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,160
...this is where its soul comes from.

264
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,520
As the soul descends from heaven...

265
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,760
...only the sparrows can see it.

266
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,959
So they sing.

267
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,359
So whenever you hear a sparrow sing,
you know a baby`s about to be born?

268
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,839
The Guf. l like it.

269
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,479
l`ll get the dessert.

270
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,920
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes, please.

271
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,599
Wasn`t that the sweetest story?

272
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,800
lt sounded like a bunch of guff to me.

273
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,719
"The second angel
poured his bowl into the sea.

274
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,680
"And it became as the blood
of a dead man...

275
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,959
"...and every living thing...

276
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,439
"...died that was in the sea."

277
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,400
The prophecies...

278
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,239
...they have begun.

279
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,079
The Guf.

280
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,839
Do you like that?

281
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,199
l do. lt reminds me of a story l heard.

282
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,839
lt`s ltalian. Really good quality.

283
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,479
l don`t know. l`ve spent
so much money already.

284
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,920
But it`s so cute. Yeah, why not?

285
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,160
You only live once, right?
Will this be on your card?

286
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,239
Mrs. Quinn, are you okay?

287
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,040
Yeah, l`m fine.

288
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:06,400
Shit.

289
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
Excuse me, lady.
What are you doing here?

290
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,199
l`m looking for someone.

291
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,400
There`s no one here but the minyan.

292
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,880
l followed him in, he`s wearing a grey coat.

293
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
No one came in.

294
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,400
But l followed him in.

295
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,599
l`ve been here ten minutes.
No one has come in.

296
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,359
You okay?

297
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,079
Are you okay, lady?

298
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,760
Yes, l`m fine.

299
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,319
You better leave now.
We don`t want to disturb kaddish.

300
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,880
Kaddish. The prayer for the dead.

301
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,679
You`re going to be fine.

302
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,879
This won`t hurt.
You`ll just feel some pressure.

303
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,959
Don`t hurt my baby.

304
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:52,239
-Keep breathing.
-Take a deep breath.

305
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:56,280
Just take a deep breath. There you go.
We`re almost through.

306
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,760
You`re doing just fine.

307
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,360
Just hold still. Breathe.
Take a deep breath.

308
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,159
Breathe. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

309
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,280
You`re doing a good job.

310
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,600
lt`s going to come out now.

311
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,719
Good job, good job.

312
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,439
Why does this keep happening to her?

313
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,840
lt`s too early for Caesarean.

314
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,919
Right. The baby`s lungs
aren`t fully matured yet.

315
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,800
But the immediate threat is over.

316
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:39,439
Right now we have to keep her from
going into labour for at least two weeks.

317
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,199
l`ve started her on ritodrine again.

318
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:44,959
Can she go home?

319
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,800
No. l want to keep her here for 48 hours.
She needs to rest as much as possible...

320
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,040
...both mentally and physically.

321
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:55,360
-Can l see her?
-Sure.

322
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,679
There she is.

323
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,159
How are you feeling?

324
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,239
lt`s not like the last time.

325
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,840
Don`t even think about that.

326
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,520
Just rest.

327
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,479
l know that feeling. lt`s different this time.

328
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,919
Something else is causing it.
The pain isn`t even the same.

329
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
lt`s not coming from the inside.

330
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,000
Margaret said you can come home
in a couple of days.

331
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:35,159
Then a couple days in bed,
you`ll be as good as new.

332
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,600
Why won`t she believe me?
Can`t she find out what`s really going on?

333
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,439
She`s trying, Abby.

334
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,439
l know something`s happening.

335
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,120
lt`s different this time.

336
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,239
l know it is.

337
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,879
"The third angel poured his bowl
into the rivers, and they became...

338
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,479
"...blood."

339
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,560
Reports of more fighting near
the Nicaraguan border today.

340
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:22,159
ln the fiercest confrontation of the year,
casualties are mounting on both sides.

341
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,360
Refugee camps have sprung up
in areas considered safe...

342
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:29,520
...but even these have received sniper fire.

343
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,760
l love the news.

344
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,320
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

345
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,719
-Want some dinner?
-Want me to cook?

346
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,280
l`ll take care of it.
How about some pasta primavera?

347
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,399
-Do you know how long that`ll take?
-Twenty minutes. l`ll go pick it up.

348
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,520
...rescuers can only watch
the great beings gasp for breath...

349
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,679
...away from what had always been,
for them and us...

350
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,320
...the protective sea.

351
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:02,360
Locally, a different kind of tragedy today.

352
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,399
A drive-by shooting between rival gangs
claimed the lives...

353
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,120
...of a woman and her 4-year-old child.
Caught in the crossfire--

354
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,600
The death toll in this latest
terrorist bombing is expected to climb--

355
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:17,919
Bloodshed in the war
between lraq and lran--

356
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,280
...raped repeatedly, her body was dumped--

357
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,879
...was apparently set by representatives
of a radical--

358
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,120
ln international news...

359
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,239
...French officials announced
they have two suspects...

360
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,639
...in the bombing
of the Champs Elysees restaurant....

361
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,679
Abby.

362
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:38,639
l`m sorry.

363
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,080
lt`s okay. l thought you were away.

364
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,919
l just came back.

365
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,879
No, please.

366
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,199
l just wanted to....

367
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,560
How do you feel?

368
00:39:57,919 --> 00:39:59,320
l`m all right.

369
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:04,080
l thought l saw you the other day,
in the rain.

370
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,040
l wasn`t sure if it was you,
but l thought you might need a ride.

371
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,800
You are very kind.

372
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,560
That`s rare.

373
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,320
Were you there?

374
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,360
So much misery.

375
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,280
Man against man.

376
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,560
They kill each other. They have no faith.

377
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,639
l used to think the world would change...

378
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,080
...but it hasn`t.

379
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:49,280
No, l guess it hasn`t.

380
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,919
lt`s sad.

381
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,560
The course is chosen...

382
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,360
...and it can`t be turned.

383
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,919
What do you mean, "course"?

384
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,520
Toward death.

385
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,679
l really don`t think we`ll blow ourselves up.

386
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,479
l didn`t mean that.

387
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,360
l better go upstairs now.

388
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,439
Excuse me.

389
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,760
l`m sorry about the baby.

390
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:40,679
After all your travels, Father Lucci...

391
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,919
-...you`ve reached these conclusions?
-l have, Your Eminence.

392
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,399
You have no doubt, no doubt whatsoever,
regarding the signs?

393
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,840
No doubt at all. They were not signs.

394
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,520
Not to try your patience, Father,
but once again:

395
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,000
The snow in the Negev.

396
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,239
Didn`t the lsraeli Army report that?

397
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,719
l was there.

398
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,840
l saw a freak,
an aberration of convective showers.

399
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:14,360
Frigid air from the Balkans
was swept into a cut off low.

400
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:19,040
lt created a storm of such intensity,
it sucked the freezing rain from the sky.

401
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,280
lt turned everything in its path to ice.
A rare occurrence.

402
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:25,639
lt happens once in 100 years.
But a sign from God?

403
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,399
Everything you saw...

404
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,639
...was either scientifically explainable
or a hoax?

405
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,840
Yes, Your Eminence.

406
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,560
My brothers, all these things l saw
were of the natural world.

407
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,639
There have been no miracles.

408
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,239
These were not signs of the Apocalypse.

409
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,959
l will tell His Holiness.

410
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:01,000
He will be quite relieved.

411
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,560
He has tickets next week to Faust.

412
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,479
"2-29." That`s the baby`s birthdate.

413
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:31,479
l can`t understand any of this.

414
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,360
What about the baby`s birthdate on it?

415
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,199
We don`t have a corner on February 29th.
You don`t know that`s what that means.

416
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:42,959
Have you ever seen
strange writing like this?

417
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:48,560
And what about those horrible clippings?
Russell, he`s here because of the baby!

418
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,399
You think David is responsible
for what`s wrong with the baby?

419
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,000
What`s wrong with the baby is called
placental insufficiency!

420
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,399
You`re wrong! l told you, it`s different!

421
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,040
lt isn`t! Nobody is trying to hurt the baby.
lt`s just like last time.

422
00:47:04,879 --> 00:47:08,000
Abby, what do you want me to do?
Kick him out?

423
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,560
Would that make you feel better?

424
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:21,479
All right. He`s gone.
l`ll tell him as soon as l see him.

425
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,520
l`m looking for Dr. Ornstein.

426
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,520
Rabbi Ornstein.

427
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:18,040
You stay.

428
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,840
Are you Dr. Ornstein, the linguist?

429
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:31,080
Among other things. May l help you?

430
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:33,280
l hope so. l`m Abby Quinn.

431
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:43,959
Nice move, lady.

432
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
-What`d l do?
-You touched him.

433
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,120
You don`t touch a Hasidic rabbi
unless you`re his wife.

434
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,919
-Are you serious?
-No. l`m making it up.

435
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,080
lt`s halakah. lt`s the law.

436
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:59,760
-l should apologise.
-l wouldn`t do that.

437
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,919
Just leave. He won`t see you again.

438
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,239
l have to see him.
l need to know what language this is.

439
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,399
That`s Melachim.

440
00:49:11,439 --> 00:49:15,040
lt`s Melachim.
lt`s a secret form of Hebrew, like a code.

441
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,879
ln the Middle Ages,
scholars used it to protect their writings.

442
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,080
You know it?

443
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,040
l hope so. l learned it from him
when l was nine.

444
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:25,280
Then you can translate it?

445
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:29,479
l guess so. lt`s just
a simple replacement alphabet.

446
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,919
Come on. There`s a book l`ll need.

447
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,919
Here it is.

448
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:50,639
So, what is this?
How does this date translate?

449
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,840
That`s not a date.

450
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,399
Of course it is. 2-29. February 29th.

451
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,800
-Have you ever read the Bible?
-Well, yeah.

452
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:06,520
Well, 2:29, it`s a Bible heading.
Chapter and verse.

453
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,080
Chapter 2, verse 29.

454
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,000
Are you sure?

455
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,719
The whole page is a quote from the Bible.
Book of Joel 2:29.

456
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,560
Can you read it for me?

457
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:25,439
"Even upon the menservants
and maidservants in those days...

458
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,600
"...l will pour out my spirit.

459
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,360
"And l will give portents in the heavens
and on the earth...

460
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:33,840
"...blood and fire and columns of smoke.

461
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,520
"The sun shall be turned to darkness,
and the moon to blood...

462
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:40,360
"...before the great and terrible day
of the Lord comes."

463
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,199
What is "the great and terrible day"?

464
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,000
When God passes judgement
on mankind for its sins.

465
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,840
lt`s about the Apocalypse.

466
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,120
Come on! The end of the world?

467
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,040
That`s what the portents are.
The sun going dark, the moon turning red.

468
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:56,080
They foretell the end of the world.

469
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,040
There`s a whole chain of signs,
like a countdown.

470
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,520
Earthquakes, plagues,
water turning to blood.

471
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,919
All kinds of weird natural disasters.

472
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,600
They`re to warn us that God`s wrath
is about to destroy the world.

473
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,439
That`s what this paper`s about?

474
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,639
Yeah, the signs of the end.

475
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:16,840
Didn`t you go to Sunday school?

476
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,199
A long time ago. But they taught us
that God was a God of love.

477
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,399
Are you okay?

478
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,080
But what do Biblical prophecies
have to do with the baby?

479
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,679
Avi, would you translate it anyway,
just to be sure?

480
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:34,760
Here`s my number.

481
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,520
-l guess l could have it for you tomorrow.
-That would be great.

482
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,719
-Bye.
-Okay, Mrs. Quinn.

483
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,280
The Guf, 358.

484
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,399
"ln Judeo-Christian mythology,
The Guf is the Hall of Souls.

485
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,159
"Every time an infant is born,
this is where its soul comes from.

486
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,280
"Folklore says sparrows can see the soul`s
descent and this explains their song.

487
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:37,080
"But a day will come
when the sparrow sings no more...

488
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,479
"...because there are only
a finite number of souls in The Guf.

489
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,600
"lt`s when the last soul is used, and
The Guf is empty, that the world will end.

490
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,639
"The first infant born without a soul...

491
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,399
"...born dead as a soulless child
must be, heralds...

492
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,639
"...the death of the world,
and so is called...

493
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,879
"...The Final Sign."

494
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,159
l`m trying to reach the governor.
lt`s urgent.

495
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,600
l told you it has to do
with Jimmy Zaragoza`s execution.

496
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:22,639
Russell, it`s Abby.

497
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,800
l`ve already spoken to his aide.
l need to speak to him directly.

498
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,879
Yes, l`ll hold. Tell her l`ll call her back.

499
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,879
l tried, but she`s not at home.
She says she must speak to you right now.

500
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:38,040
Cover for me. Abby, are you all--

501
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,719
lt`s not the baby`s birth date,
it`s from the Bible.

502
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,239
He`s here because of the baby.

503
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:45,919
Slow down.

504
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:48,600
He thinks it`s a Bible sign!

505
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,280
He told us about it,
but not the whole story. Listen:

506
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:57,320
"The first infant born without a soul,
born dead as a soulless child must be--"

507
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,959
No, it`s not! He`s a religious fanatic!

508
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,080
He thinks if he can kill the baby,
he`ll end the world.

509
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,439
-Listen to me.
-l`ve got the governor.

510
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,199
Ask him to hold. l want you to go home.

511
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,280
All right? l promise.

512
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,679
Sorry, he wouldn`t wait.

513
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,320
Oh, Christ!

514
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,399
Keep working on this
and l`ll try him from home.

515
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,399
Russell, are you here?

516
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:36,600
-You won`t kill my baby.
-Your baby`s dying because it has no soul.

517
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,320
-Don`t say that.
-The Guf is empty!

518
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,840
l won`t let you kill my baby.

519
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,639
Don`t you think l cry for man?

520
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:48,280
l`ve tried to intercede, but God has judged!

521
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,399
-Man`s sins are--
-Stay away!

522
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,360
l can`t die again, Abby. l wish l could.

523
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,239
-l`m His messenger.
-You`re crazy.

524
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,399
-l was here before.
-Stay away.

525
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,040
lt`s time for you to know, Abby.

526
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,840
l came as the Lamb...

527
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:18,879
...and l return as the Lion.

528
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,479
Now l am His wrath.

529
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,800
Strap her down!

530
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,959
lt`s happening!
Why won`t you believe me?

531
00:56:57,439 --> 00:56:59,320
You have to believe me.

532
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:14,280
Please.

533
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,600
Will you die for Him?

534
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,600
l don`t know what you could have done.
This can happen.

535
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,719
l know the delusions seem extreme,
but she`s under enormous stress.

536
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,919
There`s incredible guilt involved when....

537
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:47,120
Well, you certainly know the history.

538
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:52,040
What do we do now?

539
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,679
This sounds pathetic, but the best
we can do is wait and see. Watch her.

540
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:03,520
The baby`s fine. He`s hanging in there.

541
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:07,199
lf this is just an episode,
she can go home in a couple of days.

542
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,879
Will you be able to stay with her?

543
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,399
-Not all the time.
-Then we should get you a nurse to help.

544
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,040
And l think you should go home now
and get some serious rest.

545
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,000
Of course, God will judge the world.

546
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,320
-Could it be happening now?
-lt could happen any time.

547
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:34,000
Jesus said the end would come
like a thief in the night.

548
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,679
That belief is fundamental
to every religion.

549
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,800
Moslem, Christian, Jew, Hindu.

550
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,560
There are differences amongst them
as to how it will actually happen...

551
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:48,199
...but we all believe in a Messiah
who delivers God`s wrath...

552
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:49,800
...upon the world.

553
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:54,000
Then it could be happening.
The moon has turned to blood.

554
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:57,000
l told you about the paper and the fish.

555
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,199
Yes. ln Revelation,
it is written that the sea will die.

556
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,360
-Then you do see it?
-With perfect clarity.

557
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,760
l see a young man
with a very large imagination.

558
00:59:10,439 --> 00:59:13,479
What you`re forgetting is that
the prophetic signs are signs.

559
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,439
They`re symbols.
They`re not meant to be taken literally.

560
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,360
They`re poetry written to describe
the concept of greater divine judgement...

561
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,320
...not to be checked off like a laundry list.

562
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:27,280
So the moon and the fish?

563
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:31,520
Coincidence. You`re forgetting
the most important aspect of eschatology.

564
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:35,719
That when the end comes,
with it comes eternal life...

565
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,679
...for those of us who are saved.

566
00:59:39,399 --> 00:59:41,760
Well, who`ll be saved, Reverend?

567
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:45,040
The Jew doesn`t think
it will be the Moslem.

568
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,560
The Moslem doesn`t think
it will be the Christian.

569
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:50,560
The Christian doesn`t think
it will be the Buddhist.

570
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,639
What if nobody is saved?
What if we`re all wrong?

571
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,120
My God. What if it`s just
the Hare Krishnas?

572
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,120
-You`re too young to worry so much.
-That`s what my rabbi said.

573
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,000
Believe me, Avi,
someday you`ll make quite a philosopher.

574
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,560
lf there is a someday.

575
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,000
Hello, Mr. Quinn. She`s fine.

576
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,120
Could you give me that number again?

577
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,199
When? Well, l have to leave.
No, it`s impossible--

578
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,080
No, she`s upstairs resting.

579
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,760
l`ll tell her.

580
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,360
l want my baby.

581
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,320
We still house noviciates here, of course.
But we do get quite a few guests, also.

582
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,239
Mostly people passing through
on their way to new parishes.

583
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,000
-ls that what you`re doing, Father Lucci?
-Yes, it is.

584
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,479
-Then you won`t be staying very long?
-Father Morrell?

585
01:03:15,479 --> 01:03:16,959
May l help you?

586
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,719
No, Father, this is Father Lucci.

587
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:22,159
l`m sorry. l thought that....

588
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:25,239
But the resemblance is...

589
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,239
...remarkable.

590
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,199
l don`t believe we`ve met.

591
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:33,399
No, it couldn`t be. That was long ago.

592
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,239
Very long ago.

593
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,159
lf you`ll excuse me.

594
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,479
But the resemblance...

595
01:03:43,439 --> 01:03:44,840
...it`s remarkable!

596
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,159
Really?

597
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,560
Good night, Father.

598
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,000
Abby?

599
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:20,520
Why is this happening?

600
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,800
God`s grace is empty.

601
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:25,919
There`s nothing l can do.

602
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,040
The signs have begun.
As each passes, the end grows closer.

603
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:34,120
Then why are you here?

604
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,000
l`m its deliverer. l`m its witness.

605
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,000
What if a sign didn`t happen?

606
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:49,159
What if a sign could be stopped before
my baby comes? What would happen?

607
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,159
Please, tell me.

608
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:54,879
Then the chain would be broken.

609
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,120
But it would take something
you don`t have.

610
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:01,360
Hope.

611
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,800
How can someone who cared
so little for life...

612
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,679
...give life to the world?

613
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,959
l do care.

614
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,639
l`m going to try.

615
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:35,280
l`m going to try.

616
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:38,600
Any chance at all, sir?

617
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:42,919
What can you do now that
the federal appeal has been denied?

618
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:49,199
With less than 24 hours to go,
can you do anything to stop the execution?

619
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,719
"The windows of heaven," Mrs. Quinn...

620
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:50,840
"...the windows of heaven are open
and the earth is rent asunder.

621
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,439
"lt falls...

622
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:56,360
"...and will not rise again!"

623
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,959
Please, Mrs. Quinn, it doesn`t have to be.

624
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,840
How do you know my name?

625
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,959
l followed the signs. They led me to you.

626
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:10,959
Who are you?

627
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:14,840
A priest who`s come to help you
and your baby. We don`t have much time.

628
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:16,000
Please.

629
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,239
l know what you`re going through.
l know what`s going to happen.

630
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,320
Hey, Mrs. Quinn!

631
01:07:51,479 --> 01:07:54,120
l must know everything he`s told you
if l`m to help.

632
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,040
He said if l can stop a sign,
the chain will be broken.

633
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:58,199
He said that?

634
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,199
Yes, and God would grant the world
a second chance.

635
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,959
Did he tell you which sign to stop?

636
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,959
No, l`m trying to figure it out.

637
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,320
No, no. That`s impossible.
A sign can`t be stopped.

638
01:08:09,439 --> 01:08:11,719
He wouldn`t have told me
if there weren`t a way.

639
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,520
That`s why l have to know the other signs.
You said you knew them.

640
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,479
God has no secrets.
The signs are contained in the seven seals.

641
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,120
The first four have already begun.
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

642
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,319
And their signs are almost over.

643
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,000
-The fifth is the death of the last martyr.
-A death could be stopped.

644
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,919
But whose? Where?

645
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,439
-What about the sixth?
-The sun will turn to darkness...

646
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,680
...and the earth will quake
and the stars shall fall from the sky.

647
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,839
"And when the Lamb opened
the seventh seal...

648
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,439
"...there was silence in heaven."

649
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,279
The silence of The Guf, empty.

650
01:08:52,919 --> 01:08:55,560
The stillbirth of the soulless child.

651
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,839
You are the seventh seal.

652
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:08,240
l`m not going to let my baby die.

653
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,439
One of the signs has to be stopped.

654
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,399
How? Do you know how?

655
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,479
With hope.

656
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,399
Can hope stop an earthquake?

657
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,160
Can it stop a murder
halfway around the globe?

658
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,600
The fourth horseman still rides.

659
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,120
The angels have unleashed the winds
from the corners of the earth.

660
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,799
Can you stop that with hope?

661
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:53,120
Will you die for Him?

662
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,720
Will you die for Him?

663
01:10:06,759 --> 01:10:07,720
No!

664
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,680
You hit him in my dream.

665
01:10:15,839 --> 01:10:17,399
lt was no dream.

666
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,560
You were there.

667
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,759
You`re not here to help.
You want the world to end.

668
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:26,759
Yes, Mrs. Quinn. For a very long time.

669
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:29,759
You are my deliverance.

670
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,759
There`s nothing you can do.
You can`t stop it.

671
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,640
What kind of God are you?

672
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:29,600
Let me in!

673
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:39,479
You were always nosy, Harold.

674
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,439
lt is you, Morrell.

675
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,680
But that was 70 years ago.

676
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,879
That was just yesterday to me.

677
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,120
But you haven`t aged.

678
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,000
You haven`t changed.

679
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,240
ln the name of God, how?

680
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,720
ln the name of God is how.

681
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,560
l was cursed by Him for what l had done.
l struck a man.

682
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:08,520
But, of course, He was no man.

683
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,560
He was the Son of God.

684
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:14,919
l am Cartaphilus.

685
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,959
Pilate`s gatekeeper?

686
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,799
The Roman soldier who was--

687
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:23,520
Cursed to walk the earth
until the Messiah returned.

688
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,839
Cursed to live and never die,
until it was time for the world to die.

689
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,200
And so it has been for 2,000 years.

690
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:34,839
For me, there`s been no escape
from the misery of life.

691
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,319
But l always knew my sentence
would not be eternal.

692
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:40,600
And so, l win!

693
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:44,120
An end has come! My death is at hand.

694
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,879
l won`t be stopped by anyone.
Not her, not you.

695
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,120
l can`t allow it.

696
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,040
You understand, don`t you, old friend?

697
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,359
Thank you.

698
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:15,919
Did you see him?

699
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,560
l`m gonna die?

700
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,240
l tried, Jimmy. l did everything l could.

701
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,120
They don`t understand.

702
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,720
Do you think God will forgive them?

703
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,120
l don`t know.

704
01:13:55,919 --> 01:13:58,560
So we`ve got to stop this death.
Whose death?

705
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,640
l don`t know.
lt`s somebody who`s a martyr.

706
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:05,080
-That`s the fourth sign?
-No, l think it`s the fifth.

707
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,799
The last martyr, an earthquake and....

708
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,879
l don`t know. l can`t think anymore.
You should know this!

709
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,959
That`s not my book,
it`s the New Testament.

710
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:18,439
Pull over. Pull over there!

711
01:14:28,919 --> 01:14:31,720
-What are you doing?
-Getting us a Bible!

712
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:45,799
We need a room!

713
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:52,359
Thirty bucks.

714
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:03,359
-Got it. Revelation 5. "A Scroll--"
-Read me the sixth sign.

715
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:10,040
"When he broke the sixth seal,
there was a great earthquake...

716
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,200
"...and the sun became black as sackcloth
and the moon became red as blood."

717
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,720
An eclipse.
lt`s on my calendar for tomorrow.

718
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,080
Go back to the fifth sign.

719
01:15:22,759 --> 01:15:27,200
"When He opened the fifth seal, l saw the
souls of those slain for the word of God.

720
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,000
"They cried, `Lord, when wilt thou avenge
our blood on those on the earth?`

721
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,959
"They were told to rest until the number
of their brethren was complete...

722
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,720
"...who were to be killed
as they themselves had been."

723
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:40,640
The death of the last martyr.

724
01:15:40,759 --> 01:15:44,160
lt`s someone who dies for the word of God,
before the eclipse.

725
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:45,919
How?

726
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:49,680
Tortured to death? Murdered?

727
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:57,520
Executed.

728
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,359
Attorneys were unable to get
a stay of execution for Jimmy Zaragoza...

729
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,160
...the "Word of God Killer,"
whose parents were brother and sister.

730
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,560
He murdered them, he said,
"because it was God`s law. "

731
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,120
This morning, Jimmy will die
according to man`s law.

732
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:02,959
Hello?

733
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,839
Abby, where are you?

734
01:17:06,959 --> 01:17:09,080
Russell, l know how to stop it.

735
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,640
An eclipse?

736
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,680
Abby, l can`t stop the execution.

737
01:17:16,839 --> 01:17:20,040
You must. He is the last martyr.
You can`t let them kill him.

738
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,439
There`s nothing l can do.
Tell me where you are.

739
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,160
Abby, are you all right?

740
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,200
l`ll meet you at the prison.

741
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:31,000
No! You can`t stop--

742
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,759
l`m going to leave now.

743
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:59,200
Penny! Thank God! You`ve got to
get me in! You`ve got to help me.

744
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,879
Okay, breathe, breathe.

745
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,680
Stop!

746
01:21:48,959 --> 01:21:50,359
Somebody stop him!

747
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:35,640
l did it. lt`s over.

748
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:39,080
Somebody....

749
01:22:41,919 --> 01:22:43,479
Somebody help us!

750
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,799
No!

751
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,279
Somebody help us!

752
01:22:52,919 --> 01:22:54,399
lt`s all right, Abby.

753
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:56,759
God, no!

754
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,040
Sorry. lt`s all my fault.

755
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:10,359
lt`s all right, Abby.

756
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,600
Breathe deeply.

757
01:24:21,879 --> 01:24:23,200
Relax. Breathe.

758
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,000
All right, push.

759
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:47,399
-Breathe, Abby.
-Push!

760
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,560
You`re fine.

761
01:25:02,799 --> 01:25:07,000
lt`s all right. You`re doing good.
Deep breaths!

762
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,160
Can you do it one more time?

763
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,959
One more time, Abby.

764
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:20,479
That a girl. Come on, push!

765
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,560
Hold on! The head is out!

766
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,120
Come on, sweetheart, we`re almost there!

767
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,720
We`ve lost the baby`s heartbeat.

768
01:25:48,879 --> 01:25:50,680
Will you die for Him?

769
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,120
Will you die for Him?

770
01:25:55,799 --> 01:25:57,359
Yes, l will!

771
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,399
l will die for Him.

772
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,160
l will die for Him.

773
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,799
He`s beautiful, Abby...

774
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,919
...just like you said he`d be.

775
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,919
You can`t see him...

776
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:33,879
...but you know.

777
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,759
You always knew.

778
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:57,759
The Hall of Souls is full again.

779
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:03,759
lt was you, Abby.

780
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,759
Just the one person with hope enough
for the whole world.

781
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:36,040
Remember it all.

782
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,479
Write it down.

783
01:29:39,879 --> 01:29:41,080
Tell it...

784
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,040
...so people will use the chance
she has given them.
