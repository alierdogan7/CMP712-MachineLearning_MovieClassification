1
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:51,026
I'm not letting you
drive six counties over

2
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:54,097
with somebody I don't even know!

3
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,067
...for stealing his daddy's
car, what, six damn months ago?

4
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,266
That's not what happened.

5
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,534
And he didn't mean to steal it.

6
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,903
Mindy, I raised you better than this

7
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:03,430
for you to be giving me
this bullshit right now.

8
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:03,930
His dad...

9
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:06,443
You are 16 years old!

10
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,277
Yeah, I'm older than you
were when you got pregnant!

11
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,181
That does not make it
okay for you to run wild!

12
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,550
If anything, it means the opposite!

13
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:16,701
Mindy Prairie Austin, can't you
see I'm trying to protect you?

14
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:17,929
Oh, protect me from what?

15
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,088
It's a concert! Six of
us are gonna be there.

16
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:21,514
What's gonna happen?

17
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:23,826
The answer is no.

18
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:25,961
Do you have any clue
what this means to me?

19
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,618
What this could do?

20
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,893
All my friends are going!

21
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,420
Let's not get overly dramatic, dear.

22
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,647
If you want to hang around
and be with your friends

23
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,274
some other day when you
don't have to drive

24
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,667
a hundred miles outside of town...

25
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,093
You know, I could have lied!

26
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,189
You will not be going out forever!

27
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:45,848
Why don't you go to your room?

28
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:47,950
I am sick of this!

29
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,253
Mom, you can't just yell at me
every time you feel like it.

30
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:56,824
I could've just said I was going to
Sarah's and you'd have never known.

31
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,420
You think about that? Don't
I get any credit for that?

32
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,647
Great job. I am so proud of you.

33
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,836
You're still not goin'.

34
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,262
I hate you!

35
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,052
Joshua, put away the chips.

36
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,479
You already had dinner.

37
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,700
Joshua.

38
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,074
<i>Keep listening to WFKK

39
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,634

Where you at with the new
playground equipment?

47
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,016
Don't try to distract me.

48
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:09,514
It's going well.

49
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,351
Thanks for comin' to the potluck.

50
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:14,189
A little of that makes a
little of this okay, right?

51
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:15,723
Isn't that how it work?

52
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,358
Whatever your motives.

53
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,694
There would've been something
missing without the chief's chili.

54
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,497
Yeah... heartburn.

55
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,997
The point is,

56
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,533
we are almost to our fund-raising goal

57
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:26,535
and you two fine public servants are

58
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:29,437
about to put us over the top.

59
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:31,740
I'm gonna make sure
there's a little plaque

60
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,673
with your names on the teeter-totter

61
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:36,011
in honor of this generous contribution.

62
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:37,048
Lord willing.

63
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:40,050
Ogden, you get a read on that?

64
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,187
Does it mean he's got a
terrible hand and needs help

65
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:46,524
or he's got a great
hand and is bluffing?

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,504
There's your answer. Fold.

67
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,345
I ain't so sure.

68
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,692
Much as I hate to disappoint them kids,

69
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,529
I think I'm gonna make
you show me them cards.

70
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,697
All right then. Call, raise, whichever.

71
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:02,865
Just quit wasting time and
give me my damn money.

72
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,778
This better be life or death, Florence.

73
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,209
It's Mrs. Austin.

74
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:13,310
- Says it's urgent.
- I'm out.

75
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,946
Past time to call it a night, anyway.

76
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,815
Wife is going to be pissed, so...

77
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,185
No, come on. That...

78
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:22,685
That... that can wait.

79
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:25,856
I'm gonna hit your little
boys' room on my way out.

80
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:26,990
Fine.

81
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,893
Just don't forget to
open a window this time.

82
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,997
Shit.

83
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:54,550
What can I do for you, Betsy?

84
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:56,485
Reverend...

85
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,122
it's Joshua.

86
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,322
You have to help him.

87
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:00,947
What is it?

88
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:04,182
It's just like you've been
talking about on Sundays.

89
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,886
Like the Conners boy
and Miss Martindale.

90
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,355
You sure? I mean, there's a...
there's a lot of things...

91
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,781
I'm sure.

92
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,302
Kyle!

93
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:39,460
Kyle!

94
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,149
Kyle, come on!

95
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,086
Kyle, you asshole!

96
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,287
I can see you!

97
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,923
Let me in!

98
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,860
You know I'll stay here all
goddamn day if I have to.

99
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,638
Please go.

100
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,307
And leave your sorry ass all alone?

101
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,642
Not a chance.

102
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,410
You can't be here.

103
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,751
It's worse than I thought.

104
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,587
How long has it been since
you ate a vegetable?

105
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,890
Do you even remember solid poop?

106
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,389
This isn't healthy.

107
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,332
Why are you here?

108
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,657
I'm checking in on you, shithead.

109
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:30,885
Because I care about you.

110
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:33,014
You know people do that, right?

111
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:34,514
Care about other people?

112
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,153
Things are that dull with
your real family then, huh?

113
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:40,123
I'm not even going there with you.

114
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:44,927
Why didn't you call me
when you ran out of food?

115
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:47,472
Were you out of minutes or somethin'?

116
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:48,999
I lost that phone.

117
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,582
Is this you punishing yourself?

118
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,298
Take a fucking shower already.

119
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:54,873
Okay.

120
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,107
I appreciate your judgment,

121
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,777
really do,

122
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,610
but you can quit making me your mission.

123
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,513
I'm doing just fine.

124
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:05,678
You don't owe me anything.

125
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:07,102
Bullshit you're fine.

126
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,948
Look at this place.

127
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:12,049
Maybe your little savings
account will last forever.

128
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,390
You still haven't had
the water turned on.

129
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,892
I don't need it.

130
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:23,162
And bullshit I don't owe you anything.

131
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,931
You know better.

132
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:33,440
It's my home, Megan.

133
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:40,379
Please let me get you some food.

134
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,014
Let me get you out of here...

135
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:44,716
at least for an hour.

136
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:49,053
Maybe you'll luck out and the place
will burn down while we're gone.

137
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,283
One hour?

138
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:58,729
Then you'll leave me alone?

139
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,024
All right.

140
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,628
I'll meet you out front... Don't.

141
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,495
I'll meet you out front in five minutes.

142
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,370
Morning, Reverend.

143
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:07,705
It is a fine one.

144
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,096
Any change?

145
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,562
I'm afraid not.

146
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:13,743
Thank you.

147
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:16,076
I got donuts too.

148
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:18,880
But I'm afraid they didn't
survive the drive over.

149
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:29,224
Is he awake?

150
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,494
I brought him some food this morning,

151
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,429
but I don't know if he ate it.

152
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:39,235
He scares me.

153
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:43,739
The Lord would never abandon
one of his children.

154
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,710
And neither would I.

155
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:49,711
Now...

156
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,749
let's see about your boy.

157
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,725
They really do need to get
more organic produce here.

158
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,592
The selection is pathetic.

159
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,717
Organic shredded wheat.

160
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:18,345
High in fiber. Poops be solid.

161
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:27,039
You shouldn't have brought me here.

162
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,003
I don't know what I ever did
to make you hate me so much.

163
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:32,342
I don't hate you, Megan.

164
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,519
Then why do you avoid
me like the plague?

165
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,476
If I get you this,
you'll call me next time

166
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,811
you need something...

167
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,445
and not the one person on Earth

168
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,014
you're not supposed to call?

169
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,217
Do your 12-year-old students
notice your condescending tone

170
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,520
or is that just me?

171
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,222
Pretty much just you.

172
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,558
I don't want you to
get in trouble again.

173
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,494
Is that so wrong?

174
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,164
I won't call her.

175
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:09,971
Soup preference?

176
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,306
Ech.

177
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,748
Kyle Barnes is here.

178
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,150
That must be a sign, I tell you.

179
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:25,692
Kyle Barnes?

180
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:28,998
Uh, yeah.

181
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:31,668
We went to church with
your mother, Kyle.

182
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,937
Do you remember me? Florence Hall?

183
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,238
Uh... okay.

184
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,774
It's been a long time.

185
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,177
- It's good to see you.
- And you too, dear.

186
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,713
Haven't seen you in
church in a long time.

187
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,857
You really should attend a sermon.

188
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,289
Yeah.

189
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,383
I'll try.

190
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,753
We're asking everyone in Rome
to pray for the Austin boy.

191
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:56,498
- Hm.
- You know the family?

192
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,036
Uh, I don't. No.

193
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,561
Their son, Joshua, bright boy.

194
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:04,480
He's fallen prey to dark forces.

195
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,784
It's like what happened to your
poor mother all over again.

196
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:10,954
It is such a shame. So terrible.

197
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,590
And so soon after the Conners family.

198
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:15,090
Reverend Anderson has been visiting

199
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,126
little Joshua all week.

200
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:19,696
Can you keep him in your
thoughts and prayers?

201
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,065
Yeah.

202
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:24,000
I can do that. Sure.

203
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:26,203
You were always such a sweet boy.

204
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:29,405
We should be going, Flo.

205
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,897
I hope I'll see you soon at the service.

206
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,234
I'll try.

207
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,660
Great.

208
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,528
Thank you.

209
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,163
Are they kidding with
that fucking nonsense?

210
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:46,018
"Dark forces"?

211
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,153
Please.

212
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:50,154
Your mother was sick, and some people

213
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,157
in this backwards town are crazy.

214
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,673
Kyle?

215
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:09,374
Come on!

216
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:10,675
Come on! Come on!

217
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,545
Come out and face me, coward!

218
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:15,613
In the name of Jesus, I command
you to release this child!

219
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,672
You're hurting him!

220
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,133
Go downstairs!

221
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:19,157
Look into my eyes

222
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,118
and see the power I hold over you.

223
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,488
The power given to me by
the Almighty God our Lord.

224
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,991
No... power.

225
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:27,491
You don't belong here.

226
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:28,993
In the name of Jesus,

227
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:31,028
I cast you out!

228
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,665
Oh my God.

229
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:39,837
Oil of the spirit

230
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,807
and the holy water of
the cleansing of God...

231
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:46,744
Joshua!

232
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:49,080
- Baby, wake up.
- Betsy, get out!

233
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,182
- Just wake up, baby.
- Get the fuck out!

234
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,382
Oh!

235
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,252
Oh!

236
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,181
Heavenly Father, please
grant me the strength

237
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,757
to overcome this evil I now face!

238
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,125
- Allow me to drive this demon out
- Joshua!

239
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:01,960
so that his body can be
filled with the Holy Ghost

240
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,596
and put back upon a path to your glory!

241
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:12,642
- Appreciate this.
- The hell?

242
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,303
Is that gratitude?

243
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,049
Shut up.

244
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:18,416
<i>Your
father was a coal miner.

245
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,720
<i>Your grandfather was a coal miner.

246
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,990
This boy those women
are talking about...

247
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,759
you hear anything?

248
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,994
Don't go down that road again.

249
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:31,395
I remember when you first moved in,

250
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:32,730
before Mom and Dad adopted you.

251
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,800
You thought there were demons
hiding in every shadow.

252
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:39,038
And Anderson really filled
your head with some bullshit.

253
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,806
I'm just worried about that boy.

254
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:46,076
Yeah, well, not much you can do there.

255
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:52,983
Hey!

256
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:54,432
You lost?

257
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,436
If you're gonna backseat drive,

258
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:57,935
climb in the back fuckin' seat.

259
00:19:58,001 --> 00:19:59,249
Where are you taking me?

260
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,117
Come on! You've never
even seen the new house!

261
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,852
- Oh, my...
- It's been two years!

262
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,054
Damn it, Megan! No!

263
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:06,690
I know you don't want me
around your daughter.

264
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,202
Your husband hates me.

265
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,740
- Please.
- A nice dinner will be good for you.

266
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,652
You can shower with actual hot water.

267
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,109
I'll give you some of
Mark's old clothes.

268
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,547
- Oh, God.
- Holly loves you.

269
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,653
You don't hate us enough
to jump from a moving car.

270
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:26,156
I'll take that as a win.

271
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,770
Uh, Megan brought me
over against my will.

272
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:46,195
Honest.

273
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,646
Look, Mark, I'm the only person

274
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:49,881
who wants me here less than you do.

275
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,115
Believe me, man. You know how she is.

276
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:53,984
Do I ever.

277
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,237
Honey, is that you?

278
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,240
Yep.

279
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,480
Nice shirt.

280
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,449
Hey, doodlebug.

281
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,308
Uncle Kyle is here.

282
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:11,598
Yeah, I know that.

283
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:13,603
I saw him with my own eyes.

284
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:18,273
Listen, sweetie, can you
go on up to your room?

285
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,009
Need to talk to your mama.

286
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,979
Go on. Scoot.

287
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,016
Now, Holly.

288
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,656
Yes, ma'am.

289
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:34,924
Megan, why?

290
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,693
Come on. You know how I feel about this.

291
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:39,996
It's just one goddamn dinner, okay?

292
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,998
Do you really think he's stable?

293
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:46,134
I mean, you can't tell me that
you feel safe around him.

294
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:48,563
You think it's a good idea to
bring him around our daughter?

295
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:51,240
Well, he's in there, she's in here.

296
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:52,699
Oh, okay.

297
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,500
So, he's just gonna eat in there alone?

298
00:21:54,598 --> 00:21:56,001
That's not gonna be awkward?

299
00:21:57,903 --> 00:22:00,240
Look...

300
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:03,775
I know what he did for you
when you were younger...

301
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,546
and we can never thank
him enough for that.

302
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:10,282
But he took a turn when
he got older, okay?

303
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:11,782
You can't ignore that!

304
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:14,953
How can you be okay with him
being here after what he did?

305
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:16,855
He made a mistake and he did a horrible,

306
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:18,790
unforgivable thing, and...

307
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:20,727
damn it, he's paid for that.

308
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,041
It's ruined his life,

309
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:22,942
and I'm gonna be here for him.

310
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,077
What?

311
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:29,215
You think he's gonna attack
Holly over the dinner table?

312
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,522
It's just dinner, just one night.

313
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,859
He's not gonna hurt anybody.

314
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,761
Please, Mark.

315
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:46,933
Please let me do something nice for him.

316
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,336
He's got nothin'.

317
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,148
Hey.

318
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,718
Uh...

319
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,087
You remember me, right?

320
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,490
I'm... I'm your mama's brother.

321
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,959
You hurt your little girl,

322
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,895
and now you're not her daddy anymore.

323
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,134
That's not...

324
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,317
What is it, honey?

325
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,953
Uncle Kyle left.

326
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,157
Shit. Kyle!

327
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,365
Why would he leave?

328
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,302
Why look a gift
horse in the mouth?

329
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,270
Asshole.

330
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm sure he's fine.

331
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,176
We need to get a patrol
car, have 'em pick him up,

332
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,913
drive him home?

333
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:09,412
Let him walk.

334
00:24:09,512 --> 00:24:12,281
All he ever wants is to be alone.

335
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:33,095
Hello?

336
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:41,005
Kyle, is that you?

337
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:59,137
Amber, honey, come inside!

338
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:35,040
<i>Temperatures are
expected to drop tonight

339
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:38,310
<i>with scattered showers throughout
the afternoon and into tomorrow.

340
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:40,947
<i>We should see some sunshine here...

341
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,380
Howdy.

342
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,584
Offer still good to borrow your car?

343
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,038
Sure.

344
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:24,873
Yeah?

345
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,509
Uh...

346
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:31,515
I heard about your boy, and...

347
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:33,015
um...

348
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,855
Reverend Anderson, is he here?

349
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:40,188
Hold on.

350
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:56,546
Kyle Barnes.

351
00:27:58,307 --> 00:27:59,808
This is a surprise.

352
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,143
Yeah, I know, Reverend.

353
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:05,750
It's, uh, been a long time.

354
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:09,051
I didn't know you were in town.

355
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:10,451
Yeah, um...

356
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:13,189
back about five months now.

357
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,625
I wish we were seeing each other

358
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:18,528
under different circumstances,
but I'm glad you're here.

359
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,214
Okay.

360
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,487
Uh...

361
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:29,547
Hold on, Reverend.

362
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,162
I didn't come to see the boy.

363
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:33,588
Not to help, at least. I came 'cause...

364
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:37,759
I don't really know.

365
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,694
Sure you do.

366
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,871
What you think I did, I
assure you, I didn't.

367
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:46,832
Uh-huh.

368
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,263
Doctors think you should be in therapy,

369
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,898
but we know what this is.

370
00:28:50,923 --> 00:28:52,692
We don't know anything.

371
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:56,596
Whatever you think
happened to your mother,

372
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:58,599
it was you who stopped it.

373
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:00,467
My mother was sick.

374
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,036
I don't know much else about it.

375
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:04,605
I was just a kid.

376
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,734
These things are everywhere.

377
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:10,804
They're all around us.

378
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:11,971
Now, you've been gone a long time.

379
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:13,403
You have no idea how bad it's gotten.

380
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,607
And you might not believe it,

381
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,776
but that doesn't make it any less true.

382
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,678
Why don't we stick to what we know

383
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:22,713
before we start blaming
the bogeyman again?

384
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,948
He's showing signs of very
animal-like behavior,

385
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,584
which is common.

386
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:20,936
I know you.

387
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,242
You think so, huh?

388
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:34,450
When's the last time you
went to school, Joshua?

389
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,719
Pretty cool getting to skip out

390
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:38,953
on school like this, isn't it?

391
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,625
I like school.

392
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:46,661
I miss my friends.

393
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,229
Well, I'm sure they miss you too, bud.

394
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:50,212
Why don't you stop all this,

395
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:52,433
so things can go back to normal?

396
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,142
You're scaring your mom.

397
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:56,377
You're wasting this man's time.

398
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:58,146
Stop pretending, Joshua.

399
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:01,517
He... he hasn't been
speaking like this before.

400
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:02,684
This is new.

401
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:04,787
You're all grown up.

402
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:08,991
You barely even fit in that pantry now.

403
00:31:09,324 --> 00:31:10,925
What?

404
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,327
Padlock on the door.

405
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:16,866
You used to draw pictures on the walls.

406
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:20,536
Don't you remember?

407
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:24,039
You're talking nonsense.

408
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:28,109
I know you, Kyle Barnes.

409
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,810
What do you know, huh?

410
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,480
Got any idea what you're
talking about with all that?

411
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:43,183
You're just a damn kid.
You don't know shit.

412
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:44,986
Kyle, just...

413
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:46,986
Sorry. I... I'm sorry.

414
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:49,455
We all know what we know.

415
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:54,061
Why don't you tell me
what you know then, huh?

416
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:56,895
Come on, kid.

417
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:57,931
Why don't you say something

418
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,967
that makes one goddamn bit of sense?

419
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,037
- Right now!
- Just keep your distance.

420
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:04,938
He's playing games with us.

421
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:06,438
Sit down.

422
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:08,942
I'll light the sage.

423
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:10,777
This... this should calm him.
Just, uh...

424
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:14,180
give it a few moments to...
to fill the room.

425
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:17,583
So long have we tried
to find you, Outcast.

426
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:21,367
Too long have you hidden
your light from us.

427
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:22,857
Now you heed this.

428
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,023
- In the name of the Father,
- Dull. Making us search

429
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:25,892
- the Son, and the Holy Ghost...
- through the darkness.

430
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:57,917
Here.

431
00:33:24,843 --> 00:33:27,012
Here.

432
00:33:28,113 --> 00:33:29,512
No.

433
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:39,092
He ever try to do that to you?

434
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:42,968
What about what he was saying in there?

435
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:45,128
Any of that make sense?

436
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,634
About him... knowing me?

437
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,525
Demons are tricksters.

438
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:53,527
They want you to be more scared
of them than you need to.

439
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:57,598
With the power of God on our
side, we got nothing to fear.

440
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:01,501
"The power of God."

441
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:04,432
You think your mother and
Joshua are the only ones?

442
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,401
There's a house like this one

443
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:11,638
in every town, in every country
of this whole wide world.

444
00:34:11,738 --> 00:34:14,373
And you go into those houses?

445
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:18,811
- Yes, I do.
- Well, what makes you think

446
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:20,713
you can do anything about that?

447
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:24,983
You want my advice?

448
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:26,903
Run.

449
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:31,692
While you still got something left.

450
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,695
There was a time I might
have taken that advice.

451
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:41,034
You know, I wasn't always the, uh...

452
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:45,072
the gung-ho holy warrior
you see before you.

453
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:48,275
I served God, tended my flock...

454
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,711
but I questioned.

455
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:55,115
Then I went into your house...

456
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:58,451
and I saw the devil was real.

457
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,284
And I didn't question anymore.

458
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:01,722
My path was clear.

459
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:04,791
I don't believe it's a coincidence

460
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:06,927
that you set me upon that path,

461
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:09,929
and here you are, walkin' it yourself,

462
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,065
facing all this again.

463
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:16,402
And I don't believe you're gonna run.

464
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,398
Hey, Caleb.

465
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,068
- Working late?
- Yeah.

466
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:50,836
This railing was loose.

467
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:54,407
Didn't want any of our old
folks taking a tumble.

468
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:55,708
Thank you kindly.

469
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,909
I also noticed your screen
door is coming of its hinges.

470
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,215
Might want to get you a
new one before we paint.

471
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:02,315
Paint?

472
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:04,451
I think we can hold
off for another year.

473
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,920
Money'd be better spent on more
important things than a pretty house.

474
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:11,257
Let me just show you.

475
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:32,144
- Damn.
- Yep.

476
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,784
- Maybe we could put up a fence.
- No.

477
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:38,385
- No, they'd only climb it.
- Hm...

478
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,474
You know what? Leave it.

479
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,467
- You sure?
- Yeah.

480
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:47,590
Yeah, let 'em have their fun.

481
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:50,353
We can turn the other cheek.

482
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:51,853
Mmm.

483
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:43,619
Visiting hours are ending, honey.

484
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:46,856
Yeah, uh...

485
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:48,942
I was just leavin'.

486
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,018
Aah!

487
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,588
No!

488
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:44,315
Thanks.

489
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,251
Uh, sorry, I had it all day.

490
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,625
I got some stew going inside

491
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,954
if you haven't had dinner.

492
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:57,271
Yeah, sure.

493
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,440
That sounds good.

494
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:06,213
Elise, I'm sure you don't
remember her, but...

495
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:09,851
she died a year ago this week.

496
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:11,451
I'm sorry.

497
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,822
I didn't know.

498
00:39:15,157 --> 00:39:18,958
We were married longer than we weren't.

499
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,996
Alone just don't... feel right.

500
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:24,931
It gets scarier when it does.

501
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:28,387
I never spent a day away from her.

502
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,891
Barely got through

503
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,329
a conversation without her help.

504
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:36,398
Don't expect you to know
what it's like to lose that.

505
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:41,403
Uh, Allison was a...

506
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:47,478
Well, I started out just
wanting to look at her.

507
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:52,648
And then all I ever wanted
to do was listen to her.

508
00:39:52,748 --> 00:39:54,952
But, um, you know, I...

509
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,086
I think she's the only
person who has ever...

510
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,322
truly known me.

511
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:06,628
I'm sorry for your loss.

512
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:08,496
Oh, she... She didn't die.

513
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,432
We just, uh...

514
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:14,105
It didn't work.

515
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:26,547
Elise...

516
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,856
she would want me to
tell you how sorry I am.

517
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:35,192
We knew what was happenin'.

518
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:39,195
Found you hiding under
our porch often enough.

519
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:44,068
We didn't realize how bad it was.

520
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:49,139
All of that racket, it sounded like...
discipline.

521
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:55,652
It haunted us both.

522
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:57,833
Uh...

523
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:00,536
It was a long time ago, you know?

524
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,516
Don't mean it's okay.

525
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:04,447
Kyle?

526
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,161
Any time you see a light on,

527
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,346
you come by.

528
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:12,585
I'm here...

529
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:15,320
for whatever you need.

530
00:41:25,844 --> 00:41:27,980
Thanks for the ride. My
neighbor's a good guy.

531
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,048
I don't wanna borrow his
car two days in a row.

532
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:32,951
Sorry about the mess.

533
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,119
Just throw them in the back.

534
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:35,887
It's for the kids in the hospital.

535
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:39,322
Folks think being a
preacher is a Sunday job.

536
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:43,139
I spend more time in this little old
beater than I do in the pulpit.

537
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,208
Click it or ticket.

538
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,443
Oh.

539
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,693
That your son?

540
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,079
Yeah.

541
00:42:07,548 --> 00:42:08,949
Matthew.

542
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,094
You know, I could always use
a hand delivering meals

543
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:15,164
if you got the time.

544
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:17,054
No. I'm... not good around people.

545
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:18,795
Really?

546
00:42:20,168 --> 00:42:21,402
You holed up in that house

547
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:24,172
five months in town without
showing your face.

548
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,378
Is that because what
happened to your mother?

549
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:30,045
You think you caused it?

550
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:33,981
You weren't around Joshua.
It still happened to him.

551
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,626
What if you're punishing
yourself for no reason?

552
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:37,693
What if I'm right?

553
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:41,364
Then why are you coming with me?

554
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:44,744
To find answers.

555
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,713
Is that why you came back to Rome?

556
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:51,632
I heard you had a family.

557
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:54,503
Things were going good for you.

558
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,072
Maybe I just missed the house.

559
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:45,052
I read scripture to him.
It didn't do anything.

560
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,918
Holy water irritated him severely,

561
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:51,054
but had no long-term effect.

562
00:43:57,661 --> 00:43:59,730
Will you pray with me?

563
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,527
You are very brave to return.

564
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,521
He doesn't like the light.

565
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,492
My mother didn't either.

566
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:33,637
That day with her, it was the same.

567
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,742
Why don't you like light, Joshua?

568
00:44:37,943 --> 00:44:40,777
Think back on that day.
What else did you do?

569
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:46,217
I hit her.

570
00:44:47,286 --> 00:44:49,353
She attacked me, and...

571
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:50,688
I'd had enough.

572
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:52,190
She'd done it many times before.

573
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,559
This time, I fought back.

574
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,893
It seemed to...

575
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,262
hurt her.

576
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,300
More than it should've.

577
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,635
Just help me get him into the light.

578
00:45:04,737 --> 00:45:06,938
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

579
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:08,436
Come on. Don't think about your mother!

580
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,840
Think about the boy! Come on!

581
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,309
- No!
- You're leaning on my last nerve, boy!

582
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,478
- No! No!
- You're unwelcome here!

583
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:14,978
You do not belong here!

584
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:16,780
In the name of God, I cast you out,

585
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,583
no matter how long it takes!

586
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,342
Stronger than Allison.

587
00:46:15,077 --> 00:46:16,478
Kyle!

588
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,864
What do you want from me?

589
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,813
Kyle!

590
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,751
You gotta stop it!

591
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:29,364
Why won't you leave me alone?

592
00:46:58,226 --> 00:47:02,998
The great merge... cannot be stopped.

593
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:01,737
Mama?

594
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,268
- You're free to go.
- What?

595
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:50,266
Chief, you can't be serious.

596
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,447
Nothing happened here, Officer Holter.

597
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:56,275
The mother's saying it's just
one big misunderstanding.

598
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:57,632
What?

599
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,802
Look, just because you're
friends with the preacher...

600
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:02,670
It doesn't matter what
we think happened.

601
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,768
You can drag him into town,

602
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:05,697
file all the paperwork you want.

603
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:09,132
The fact is, the mother
refuses to press charges.

604
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:11,436
There's nothing more for us to do here.

605
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:12,934
Let's wrap this up.

606
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:32,489
After everything Megan's done for you...

607
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:46,436
Come on.

608
00:49:46,536 --> 00:49:48,039
Take you home.

609
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:34,152
Did you get the answers
you were looking for?

610
00:50:35,418 --> 00:50:36,818
Some.

611
00:50:41,324 --> 00:50:43,996
I've seen a lot.

612
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,398
Thought I'd seen the worst
suffering a man could imagine,

613
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:50,168
but that was...

614
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,905
I've never seen anything
like that before.

615
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:01,179
That what it was like with
your mother in the end?

616
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,184
Different with her.

617
00:51:07,217 --> 00:51:10,338
It wasn't like that with my wife either.

618
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:17,027
I always thought it was
something I did to them.

619
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:20,097
Now I know it's something else.

620
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:23,202
It's still because of me.

621
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:27,905
Seems like they've been coming
after me my whole life.

622
00:52:40,606 --> 00:52:42,125
Allison!

623
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:42,686
Allison!

624
00:52:47,114 --> 00:52:48,514
Amber!

625
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,045
Come on. Breathe, baby girl!

626
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,860
No.

627
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:06,971
Allison, no.

628
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:27,431
Come and get me.
