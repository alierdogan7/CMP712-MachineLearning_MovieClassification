18
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,630
Ushi, are you there?

19
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,100
Yes.

20
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,880
Get something?

21
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,930
Nothing but junk.

22
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,360
Is this the best you can do?

23
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,760
Kyoto's been burned down.

24
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,710
They say the emperor
has escaped to Mount Yoshino.

25
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,410
So no more big battles.
Just skirmishes now.

26
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,990
Can't do any business.

27
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,220
This is good millet.

28
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,860
One more bag.

29
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,200
Take it or leave it.

30
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,100
Say, you want one more bag?

31
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,770
Sleep with me.

32
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,610
I'd never sleep with you,
you bastard!

33
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,160
Hachi!

34
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,490
What are you doing here?

35
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,730
I'm hungry.
Give me some food.

36
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,040
Get him a bowl.

37
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,820
It's a wonder you made it back!

38
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,870
Where's my husband?

39
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,070
Wait a minute.

40
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,080
You came back alone?

41
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,220
I escaped.

42
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,920
Where's my son?

43
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,280
It was the Ashikaga army
that forced us go with them.

44
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,180
We fought in two of their battles.

45
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,080
In the third,
we got caught by the Kusunoki army.

46
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,790
My son too?

47
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,830
Yes, both of us.
So we became Kusunoki men.

48
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,230
All the same to us.

49
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,860
It's the generals' war, not ours.

50
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,700
We didn't even know
what they were fighting about.

51
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,370
There are two emperors now.

52
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,950
Kusunoki fights
for the emperor at Mt. Yoshino,

53
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,110
and Ashikaga
for the emperor in Kyoto.

54
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,060
It means the two emperors
are quarrelling.

55
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,260
At first, we wanted to be heroes,

56
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,500
but killing's not easy.

57
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,570
I could have gotten killed myself.

58
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,770
Once I stabbed a man
in the back with a spear.

59
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,310
He was taking a shit in the bushes,
and I killed him.

60
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,150
What happened to my son?

61
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
It was three days ago.

62
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,830
The Kusunoki army
got clobbered at Minatogawa.

63
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,330
Ashikaga's men
wiped them right out.

64
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,700
It was hell.

65
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:01,630
We couldn't tell friend from foe.
It lasted two days and two nights.

66
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,410
We tried to keep out of harm's way.

67
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,850
The general ordered us to advance,

68
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,990
but we ran around
till they chased us into a paddy field.

69
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:27,030
There was nothing to do
but play dead in the mud.

70
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,830
We fooled them.

71
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,830
We waited for our chance
and then ran for the mountains.

72
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,170
We hid in the bushes all night
and thought we'd starve.

73
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,780
So we went hunting for food.

74
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,950
We thought we'd steal from farmhouses,
but they were empty.

75
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,780
There was no food.

76
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,250
Pretty soon,
some farmers with sticks

77
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,560
came from out of nowhere
and beat us up.

78
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,500
They beat Kichi to death.

79
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,540
I barely escaped with my life!

80
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,720
My son was killed?

81
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,460
And then?

82
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,800
What happened
to the samurai who took you two?

83
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,770
He was killed right afterwards.

84
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,770
An arrow right through his throat.

85
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
He flailed around like a madman
and then keeled over.

86
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,850
Right here.

87
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,780
Serves him right!

88
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,510
He had it coming.

89
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,760
They took my son so suddenly
that we had a hard time surviving.

90
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,930
I was looking forward
to the day he would return.

91
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,100
Only you made it back.

92
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,900
It's a wonder you're still alive.

93
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,870
How do you eat?

94
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,680
There was frost last summer.

95
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,150
Hail fell.

96
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,720
Frost and hail in summer, mind you!

97
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,250
All our crops failed.

98
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,730
Strange things going on in Kyoto too.

99
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,290
A horse gave birth to a calf.

100
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,990
The sun rose black in the sky.
Day was dark as night.

101
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,600
How horrible!

102
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,670
As if the earth had been
turned upside down!

103
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,510
All the farmers are starving.

104
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,980
With all the fighting,
they can't work.

105
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,780
The fields turn to weeds
without men to till them.

106
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,820
How do you eat?

107
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,030
Never you mind!

108
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,390
We're beggars.

109
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,490
Kyoto's been burnt to the ground.
Not even a dog around.

110
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,440
Everything becomes food -

111
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,510
snakes, even earthworms and mice.

112
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,410
You're wearing nice things.
Did you steal them?

113
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,450
You're dressed oddly yourself.

114
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,620
I killed a priest on the way back
and put on his clothes.

115
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,960
People trust a priest.
Makes it easier to get around.

116
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,800
What'll you do now?

117
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,770
Is my hut left?

118
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,470
I suppose so.

119
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,040
I see.

120
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,370
I'll get some good sleep.

121
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,550
I'm very tired.

122
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,620
I'm sorry I came back alone.

123
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,370
What is it?

124
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,370
It's sad!

125
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,080
Fine day.

126
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,130
Makes war seem far away.

127
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,730
That's a big fish you caught.

128
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,640
I have nothing to eat.

129
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,470
What do you do for food?

130
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,640
You don't seem to grow anything.

131
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,440
What do you do?

132
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,900
You steal?

133
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,800
I see. That's it?

134
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,900
Everyone does
where there's fighting going on.

135
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,030
They all steal in Kyoto.

136
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,340
You steal too? Right?

137
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,940
Why didn't you save my husband?

138
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,580
I had no time to.

139
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,080
About 20 farmers attacked us.

140
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,620
I barely got away myself.

141
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,600
You've been waiting for him?
Poor girl.

142
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,700
What are you gonna do?
He's dead.

143
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,370
No use staying
with the old woman, is there?

144
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,040
Mind your tongue!

145
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,650
You're young yet.

146
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,860
How about coming to see me?

147
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,850
Nice day.

148
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,750
Hachi, what are you doing here?

149
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,920
Catching fish. Got to eat.

150
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,500
You have it.

151
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,910
Take what's offered.

152
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,850
It looks good!

153
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,680
What did Hachi say?

154
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,690
Nothing.

155
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,620
That damned good-for-nothing!
Not even sorry he came back alone.

156
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,590
Might have killed my son himself.
No different than an enemy.

157
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,830
Don't be too friendly with him.

158
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,260
Help!

159
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,210
Help!

160
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,520
Help!

161
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,260
Get the one floating away!

162
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,910
He's still alive!

163
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,190
We can eat now!

164
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,480
This is expensive stuff.

165
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,630
How about it?

166
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,770
A good buy?

167
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,580
Is that all?

168
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,670
The farmers are all hiding
in the mountains.

169
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,010
Had a hard time finding this much.

170
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,980
It's risky work.

171
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,850
Bring me some sake.

172
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,300
You were lucky.

173
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,120
It's a wonder you're back.

174
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,980
Good business you have here.

175
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,720
Only while the war lasts.

176
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,530
Don't know how much longer.

177
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,730
They won't quit for a long time yet.

178
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,270
Not until one side's beaten.

179
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,660
They'll go on
even if it ruins the country.

180
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,100
It's a business with them.

181
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,730
I'll take these birds too.

182
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,140
Bring me some good stuff.

183
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,810
Ushi's got himself a good business.

184
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,780
Armies will snap up swords,
halberds and armor.

185
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,890
There's not enough to go around.

186
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:51,260
Nothing for common soldiers,
so they use spears of wood or bamboo.

187
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,030
A good business, all right.

188
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,840
I've heard you two do good work.

189
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,100
How many have you killed?

190
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,810
That's our business.

191
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,380
You stay out of it!

192
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,050
Don't you think
you should let me join you?

193
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,150
I've been trained in war.

194
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,030
I'll come in handy.

195
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,900
Mind your own business.
We can manage on our own.

196
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,300
You hate me for returning alone?

197
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,640
I don't care what you do.
You're on your own.

198
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,740
How about making me her husband?

199
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,720
Idiot! Don't be stupid!

200
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,590
We're turning in.

201
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,530
Go on home.

202
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,500
That no-good bum!

203
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,600
He's after you.

204
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,040
You see his eyes?
Like a dog after a bitch.

205
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,910
Sniffing after you.

206
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,150
Stay away from him!

207
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,070
That louse wants a woman!

208
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,330
I want a woman.

209
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,670
Come to my hut.

210
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,650
I'll be waiting tonight.

211
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,950
Hachi's after you.

212
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,490
Don't let him catch you.

213
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,030
Who's there?

214
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,780
Who's there?

215
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,980
So it's you.

216
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,980
You came.

217
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,400
Hachi!

218
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,230
Hurry!

219
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,160
I get scared
running through the reeds.

220
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,220
Silly.

221
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,000
What are you saying?
You kill people for a living.

222
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,810
Good-for-nothing bastard,
enjoying his nap!

223
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,260
Oh, it's just you.

224
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,300
You like to sleep?

225
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,870
Yes, it's nice to have a little nap.

226
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,610
It's too hot.

227
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,410
Best to sleep in the daytime.

228
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,850
Want to sleep with me?

229
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,990
An old woman like you?

230
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,030
Stupid!

231
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,200
I'm not old on the inside.

232
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,600
Come on.

233
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,500
Try me.

234
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,770
I'm gonna go have a swim.

235
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,310
Hachi, wait!

236
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,220
What is it?

237
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,150
Something good?

238
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,250
Don't act so innocent!

239
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,360
What are you doing
with my daughter-in-law every night?

240
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,130
What do you mean?

241
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,720
I'll slap you!

242
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,040
I saw you both!

243
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,670
What do you plan to do with her?

244
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,970
She's the one who came to my place.

245
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,570
You asked her to.

246
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,580
What's wrong with that?

247
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,380
I'm a red-blooded man.
I can't stand it.

248
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,350
She's another man's wife.

249
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,180
Your son's dead.

250
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:41,190
You worthless bastard,
coming back here alone!

251
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,560
You'd take your friend's wife?

252
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,560
She's not your daughter-in-law
anymore.

253
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,460
Your son's dead.
She needs a man.

254
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:53,470
And no wonder- she's still young.

255
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,040
It's natural.

256
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:58,340
Not if you leave! Go away!

257
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,640
If I left,
they'd take me back to the war.

258
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,810
I'll stay here.

259
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,410
Then leave her alone!

260
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,080
I'll make you an offer.

261
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,790
Let her be my bride.

262
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,530
You've got nerve!

263
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,530
My poor son must be
turning in his grave!

264
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,690
You can't ask a young man
and woman who are neighbors

265
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,270
not to be friends.

266
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,740
If my son's dead, she's all I've got!

267
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,470
I can't get along alone.
I couldn't even kill!

268
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,050
Take her and I'll starve!

269
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,350
Don't worry, I won't.
We'll just be friends.

270
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,450
She'll end up deserting me.

271
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,320
I'll tell her not to.

272
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,830
Hachi, I'm begging you!

273
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:54,490
I can't kill without her!

274
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,460
You ask too much.

275
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,030
Your son's gone.
It's selfish to hold on to her!

276
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,310
When the war ends,
I can farm and manage on my own.

277
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,040
Just till then.

278
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,870
No telling when it'll end.

279
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,740
If all you want is a woman, I'll do.

280
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,020
How about me?

281
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,190
I'm not interested.

282
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,830
So you intend to take her?

283
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,590
Don't you understand yet?
I won't take her! We'll just be friends!

284
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,760
You say that now,
but she'll end up leaving me!

285
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,030
That's not my problem.

286
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,300
Remember those words, you bastard!

287
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,680
What are you gonna do?

288
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,370
I'll stab the two of you
in your sleep.

289
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,720
Then she'll be dead too.

290
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,790
Old bag!

291
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,860
Where are you going?

292
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,440
I can't sleep.

293
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,070
I thought I'd get some fresh air.

294
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,850
Yes, it's hard to sleep tonight.

295
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,160
No breeze at all.

296
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,560
No.

297
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,960
I dreamt that Kichi came back.

298
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,870
My son may return.

299
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,920
Hachi saw him die.
He won't be coming back.

300
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:30,010
Hachi's a bad man.
He might have been lying.

301
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,880
He wouldn't lie.

302
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,720
If Kichi were alive,
he'd have come back.

303
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,850
There'd be no point lying about it.

304
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,060
Aren't you sad my son is dead?

305
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:47,600
I am, but he's not coming back.

306
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,410
I'll find you a good husband.

307
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,640
Be patient.

308
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,280
When the war ends,
the men will come back.

309
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:09,860
We'll find you a good husband
and farm again like we used to.

310
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,230
Fighting!

311
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:30,180
More prey coming our way.

312
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,980
I'll help you.

313
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:16,670
Is that a wild dog?

314
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,750
Not much spirit for a wild dog.

315
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,020
It's after a mate.

316
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,600
Damned pest!

317
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,960
We'll skin you and eat you!

318
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,720
It's a terrible thing.

319
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,440
Once, in Kyoto...

320
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,710
I heard a great priest talk.

321
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,380
Those who sin in this world

322
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,950
go to purgatory when they die.

323
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,020
What's purgatory?
The dead are just ashes.

324
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,920
No, that's not true.

325
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:46,430
They say hell really exists.

326
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:52,870
A hell of fire,
a hell of fury, a hell for sinners.

327
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,970
The terrible mountain of needles,
the lake of blood.

328
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:05,020
The punishment for sinful lust
is the worst of all.

329
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:11,760
Souls with human faces
grow four legs

330
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,800
and fall into sinners' hell.

331
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:20,200
There they're tortured
day and night with red-hot irons.

332
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,310
That's a lie! There is no hell!

333
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:30,210
Hell must exist.
A great priest said so.

334
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,770
It's no sin what men and women do.
Everyone does it!

335
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,750
If it's man and wife, it's all right.

336
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,420
With couples

337
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:45,260
it's quite all right.

338
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,970
It's a terrible thing.

339
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,240
Merciful Buddha...

340
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,050
Now let's go to bed.

341
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,560
Don't be afraid.

342
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,370
I'm a human being, not a demon.

343
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:20,400
I have my reasons
for wearing a mask.

344
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,840
I'm a samurai from a good family.

345
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,920
As you can see,
I've escaped from battle.

346
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,160
I got separated from my men.

347
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,250
I hope to return to Kyoto,

348
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:45,060
but I'm lost in this field of grass.

349
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,600
Show me the road to Kyoto.

350
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,700
Go due north.

351
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,940
That will take you there.

352
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:59,540
Show me the way out of this grass.

353
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,440
After I show you the way,

354
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,560
you'll kill me.

355
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:11,450
What good is there in killing
the likes of you?

356
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,330
Find the way yourself!

357
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,200
Old woman!

358
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,700
Do you refuse?

359
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,540
All right.

360
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,510
I'll take you.

361
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:41,890
I've missed you so.

362
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:45,360
That old woman,
trying to come between us!

363
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:52,560
If we sin, do we go to purgatory?

364
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,300
Sin?

365
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:59,200
People have been doing this
for thousands of years.

366
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:02,080
But I'm willing
to go to hell for you!

367
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,280
A vast field of grass.

368
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:44,080
There's no telling
what demons and snakes live here.

369
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:47,880
And monsters like you
that wander in.

370
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,190
That's right. I'm a demon.

371
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,930
Why do you wear a mask?

372
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,170
Makes me look fierce, doesn't it?

373
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,610
You were defeated,
and now you're running from the war.

374
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:12,080
No use looking fierce now.

375
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,610
You're right.

376
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,210
Many of my men were killed,

377
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:20,720
and many others left me.

378
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:24,160
I was left alone.

379
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,930
I was left alone.

380
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,670
It's your punishment
for starting the war!

381
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,650
Old woman.

382
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,260
Would you like to know
why I wear a mask?

383
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,330
I feared marring my face.

384
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,940
My face is very handsome.

385
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,570
The most handsome face in Kyoto.

386
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:19,040
To protect it in the war,

387
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:24,710
I wore this mask
into the thick of battle.

388
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,650
As a reward
for showing you the road,

389
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:32,280
show me your handsome face.

390
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:41,540
You wouldn't be able to bear it.

391
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,310
I've never seen
anything really beautiful

392
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:53,310
since the day I was born.

393
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,650
Show me your face.

394
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,760
You wish me to so badly?

395
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,250
Show me.

396
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,260
You want to see a face
you could fall in love with?

397
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:13,700
I've never seen anyone so handsome

398
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,600
that it would take my breath away.

399
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,740
Walk on, old woman!

400
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:31,680
This is not a face
to show peasants.

401
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,760
Get going or I'll kill you!

402
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,740
Did you cause many soldiers to die?

403
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,210
A cruel thing.

404
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,940
The dead died in vain.

405
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:15,130
The dead can never come back to life.

406
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,860
Don't talk! Walk!

407
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,350
Serves you right.

408
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:42,790
Men like you killed my son!

409
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:20,270
Now let's see
just how handsome you are.

410
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:08,060
So this is the most handsome face?

411
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,190
This is a samurai general's face?

412
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:29,980
Rest in peace in this hole.

413
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,010
You have friends here.

414
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,720
You caused others to die.

415
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,720
You deserve this punishment.

416
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:00,560
- Isn't it heavy?
- No, not very.

417
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,370
Shall I go along too?

418
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:05,100
No, I'll go by myself.

419
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,700
But it'll be night when you return.

420
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,610
Once it's dark,
it can't get any darker.

421
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,150
I'll be late.

422
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,940
Eat early and go to bed.

423
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,370
Be careful.

424
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,040
What's the matter?

425
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:52,040
You'll catch cold sleeping over here.

426
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:56,740
What is it? Are you sick?

427
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,080
Your face is pale.

428
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,320
Is anything wrong?

429
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,350
No, it's nothing.

430
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,370
What's taking her?

431
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,580
Are there really demons?

432
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:22,690
Well, in hell, I guess.

433
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,930
They exist in this world too.

434
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,540
Did you see one?

435
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,040
No, I didn't.

436
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,440
We've done nothing wrong.

437
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,950
No demon can come after us.

438
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:44,320
Might come after
someone who's bad, though.

439
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,730
Shall we eat?

440
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,930
Shall I go to Ushi's place?

441
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,870
It's too hot in the daytime.

442
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,340
Night's the best time to go out.

443
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:20,280
Ushi's a sly one.

444
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:24,150
If I take too many at once,
he knocks down the price.

445
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:28,160
Better to take a few at a time.

446
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,520
We'll make more that way.

447
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,400
Well, I'll be on my way.

448
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,040
Be careful.

449
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,670
What's the matter?

450
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,900
Did you have a dream?

451
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,410
What kind of dream?

452
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:21,390
You woke me up.

453
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:07,460
Say.

454
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:12,460
You stood me up.
What's going on?

455
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,970
You tired of me?

456
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,930
It's raining. Don't go.

457
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,880
Can't let Ushi put one over on me.

458
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:06,090
Last night he said
he didn't have the millet on hand

459
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,790
and that I should pick it up tonight.

460
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:12,980
It's just a shower.
It'll stop.

461
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,920
It'll be nice and cool.

462
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:20,270
I'll be on my way.

463
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:53,690
Hey!

464
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,120
Hachi!

465
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,310
What is it?

466
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,750
- A demon!
- What?

467
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:16,150
- A demon!
- Silly! There's no such thing!

468
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:54,950
There's no such things as demons.
You just imagined it.

469
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,620
There is.
I saw it with my own eyes.

470
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:01,620
A fox or a badger, maybe.

471
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:04,230
Even weasels can fool people.

472
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,800
My head's clear again!

473
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:13,340
I wish we could live together.

474
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,310
I told you so.
Come live at my place.

475
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,470
Ouch! There's a bug on my back!

476
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,120
Set yourself free
from that old woman.

477
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:27,780
I can't. I might be punished.

478
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,410
For what?

479
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,490
It's Buddha's punishment!

480
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,860
There is no Buddha.

481
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,300
I'll come get you starting tomorrow.

482
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:30,270
Wait!

483
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,480
It's me!

484
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:38,750
I'm not a demon! It's me!

485
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,380
It's me!

486
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:45,660
It's you!

487
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,390
It's me!

488
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:49,930
It's your mother!

489
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,870
Then that demon every night -

490
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:57,030
Yes, it was me!

491
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:01,770
I was wrong. Forgive me.

492
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:07,780
I wore the mask
to scare you away from him.

493
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:12,990
Now I'm being punished for it!

494
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:16,220
The mask won't come off!

495
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:20,690
Why won't it come off?

496
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,630
Why won't it come off?

497
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:27,900
It got wet in the rain
and won't come off.

498
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:30,940
Why won't it come off?

499
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,670
Why won't it come off?

500
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,290
Look at you!
It's your punishment!

501
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:50,020
Please get it off!

502
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:51,980
Get it off!

503
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:00,790
I didn't sin!
This proves it!

504
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,810
You turned into a demon for meddling.
This proves it!

505
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,970
I was wrong.

506
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:11,080
I was wrong to meddle.

507
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,480
Get it off!

508
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:17,210
You turned into a demon!
Now stay that way!

509
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:20,310
Please get it off me!

510
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:23,890
I'm begging you!

511
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:29,460
All right,
but will you do everything I say?

512
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,900
I will!

513
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,530
Exactly as I say?

514
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:40,070
Yes, I will!

515
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,870
Can I see Hachi every night?

516
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,070
Daytime too?

517
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:50,780
You won't complain about us?

518
01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:52,350
No, I won't.

519
01:38:52,450 --> 01:38:54,450
Day and night?

520
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,390
Yes.

521
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:58,350
You sure?

522
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,160
I'm sure!

523
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,660
All right, I'll take it off.

524
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,300
It hurts!

525
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,180
It hurts!

526
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,290
Why is this happening?

527
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:30,050
Hurry, take it off!

528
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,420
Hold on, even if it hurts!

529
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:42,400
It hurts!

530
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,450
- The rain did this!
- It hurts!

531
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:57,550
You're being punished.

532
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:12,370
It hurts!

533
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,770
It's that samurai's curse!

534
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:20,570
What?

535
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:24,540
It hurts!

536
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:27,380
Hold on now, even if it hurts!

537
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,260
I'm going to die.

538
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,200
It came off.

539
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:42,190
The mask came off!

540
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:45,720
A real demon!

541
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,560
Thank you for-

542
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,870
What is it?

543
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,560
Wait!

544
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:02,470
I'm not a demon!
I'm a human being!

545
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:14,480
