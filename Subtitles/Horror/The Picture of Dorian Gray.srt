00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,980
Lord Henry Wotton
had set himself early in life

3
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,249
to the serious study
of the great aristocratic art

4
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,920
of doing absolutely nothing.

5
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,622
He lived only for pleasure,

6
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:01,657
but his greatest pleasure

7
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:04,759
was to observe the emotions
of his friends

8
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:06,463
while experiencing
none of his own.

9
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,732
He diverted himself by
exercising a subtle influence

10
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:13,303
on the lives of others.

11
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:17,442
18, I think
you said, sir.

12
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:22,149
Shall I wait, sir?

13
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,418
Yes.

14
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:29,290
Among Lord Henry's friends was
the painter Basil Hallward.

15
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:32,794
He had been strangely secretive
about his latest painting,

16
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:35,634
and Lord Henry,
sensing a mystery,

17
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,802
determined to discover
what it was

18
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:40,772
that his friend
wished to conceal.

19
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:41,909
Hello.

20
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,444
I'm sorry, miLord.
Mr. Hallward is not at home.

21
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:48,614
Mr. Hallward doesn't
wish to be disturbed.

22
00:03:11,513 --> 00:03:13,482
It's your best work,
Basil.

23
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,150
Of course,
I can't believe

24
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,086
anybody's
really as handsome

25
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:18,554
as that portrait.

26
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:18,922
Who is he?

27
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,025
Why are you being
so secretive about it?

28
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:24,927
You ought to send it
to the grosvenor.

29
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,065
I shall not send it
anywhere.

30
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,934
I've put too much
of myself into it.

31
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:30,470
Ha ha ha!

32
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,939
I knew you'd laugh,
but it's true.

33
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,508
There isn't
any resemblance

34
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,411
between you
and this adonis.

35
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:39,247
You have an intellectual
expression,

36
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:42,282
and intellect destroys
the beauty of any face.

37
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:43,452
Don't flatter yourself.

38
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:45,355
You're not
the least like him.

39
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:48,290
Of course I'm not,
and I'm glad of it.

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,394
The wisdom of Buddha.

41
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:56,234
Why are you glad
you're not like him?

42
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,139
We suffer for what
the gods give us,

43
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,807
and I'm afraid
Dorian Gray

44
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,077
will pay for
his good looks.

45
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:04,379
Is that his name?

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,214
Yes. I didn't intend
to tell you.

47
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,388
If I'm to keep
visiting you,

48
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,557
I'll have to send you
good sherry.

49
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:16,559
Why didn't you intend
to tell me his name?

50
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:18,230
As I've
grown older,

51
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,631
I've come
to love secrecy.

52
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,834
I suppose
that sounds foolish to you.

53
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,903
Come into the garden.
It doesn't sound foolish.

54
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:26,875
You forget
that I'm married.

55
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,409
The one charm
of marriage

56
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,545
is that it makes
a life of deception

57
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,648
absolutely necessary
to both parties.

58
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,384
I believe you're
a good husband

59
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:37,087
but that you're ashamed
of your own virtues.

60
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,090
Your cynicism
is simply a pose.

61
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:41,159
Being natural
is simply a pose--

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,261
the most irritating
pose I know.

63
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:44,863
Tell me
the real reason

64
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,699
you won't exhibit
the picture.

65
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,668
There's little
to tell, Harry.

66
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,838
Besides, you won't
believe it.

67
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,906
I'll believe anything,

68
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:54,008
provided it's
quite incredible.

69
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,844
I'm afraid
this will seem so.

70
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:58,714
There's something
I can't quite understand,

71
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,184
something mystic
about it.

72
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:01,518
Mystic?

73
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:03,554
I can't explain it,

74
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:05,522
but whenever Dorian
poses for me,

75
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:08,459
it seems
as if a power outside myself

76
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:09,695
were guiding
my hand.

77
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:11,564
It's as if
the painting had

78
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:14,335
a life of its own,
independent of me.

79
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,403
That's why I won't
exhibit it.

80
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:18,172
It belongs
to Dorian Gray,

81
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:20,709
and I shall
give it to him.

82
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,578
I want to meet him.

83
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,612
We shall be friends.

84
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:26,682
I always choose my friends
for their good looks

85
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,553
and my enemies for
their good intellects.

86
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,055
I despise
your principles,

87
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,425
but I enjoy the way
you express them.

88
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:35,662
I like persons
better than principles

89
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:37,730
and persons
with no principles

90
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:38,866
better than
anything else.

91
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:41,934
I remember where I heard
the name of Dorian Gray.

92
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,407
Where was it?

93
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:48,277
Don't look startled.
It was at my aunt Agatha's.

94
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:51,346
She said she'd discovered
a wonderful young man

95
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,484
to help her
with her charities,

96
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,687
and his name was
Dorian Gray.

97
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,489
I pictured somebody
with spectacles

98
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,191
tramping about
on huge feet,

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,059
so I avoided
meeting him.

100
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,528
That's a very common
butterfly, Basil--  limenitis sevilla.

101
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,833
Hardly belongs
in a gentleman's garden.

102
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:08,369
I'm glad you didn't
meet Dorian Gray.

103
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,440
I don't
want  you to meet him.

104
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,909
[Piano playing]

105
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,912
who's that at
your piano, Basil?

106
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,634
You've come early
today, Dorian.

107
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:33,970
Have I?

108
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,605
You must lend me
these pieces.

109
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,574
That depends on
how you sit today.

110
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:41,610
I thought the picture
would be finished today.

111
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:43,113
It will be.

112
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:44,382
Please go on,
Mr. Gray.

113
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:47,484
This is Lord Henry Wotton,
an old Oxford friend.

114
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,322
My aunt has spoken
to me about you.

115
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,024
You're one
of her favorites.

116
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,927
You shouldn't go in
for philanthropy.

117
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:56,929
Harry, would you mind
if I asked you to go?

118
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,066
Am I to go,
Mr. Gray?

119
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,903
Stay and explain
about philanthropy.

120
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:03,539
Basil, you've said
you liked your sitters

121
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,609
to have someone
to chat to.

122
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,844
Sit down, then,
Harry.

123
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,547
Dorian, get
on the platform

124
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,850
and don't pay attention
to Lord Henry.

125
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,720
He has a bad influence
over his friends,

126
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,455
with the exception
of myself.

127
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,292
Have you really
a bad influence?

128
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,260
There's no such thing
as a good influence.

129
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,698
All influence is immoral.

130
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:23,966
Why?

131
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:27,468
Because the aim of life
is self-development,

132
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:29,772
to realize one's nature
perfectly.

133
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,274
That's what we're here for.

134
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:34,410
A man should live out his life
fully and completely,

135
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,848
give form to every feeling,

136
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:39,984
expression to every thought,
reality to every dream.

137
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:41,821
Every impulse
that we suppress

138
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:44,024
broods in the mind
and poisons us.

139
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,993
There's one way to get rid
of a temptation,

140
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,896
and that's
to yield to it.

141
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,933
Resist it, and the soul
grows sick with longing

142
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,704
for the things it has
forbidden to itself.

143
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:57,440
There's nothing
that can cure the soul

144
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,676
but the senses,

145
00:07:58,677 --> 00:07:59,677
just there's nothing

146
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,612
that can cure the senses but the soul.

147
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:03,815
Turn left, Dorian.

148
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,785
The gods
have been good

149
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,086
to you, Mr. Gray.

150
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,222
Why do you say that?

151
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,190
You have youth,

152
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,226
the one thing
worth having.

153
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:14,161
I don't feel that,
Lord Henry.

154
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,398
Someday you'll
feel it terribly.

155
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,867
What the gods give,

156
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,268
they quickly
take away.

157
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,071
Time is
jealous of you.

158
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,473
Don't squander the gold
of your days.

159
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:26,078
Live! Let nothing be
lost upon you.

160
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,245
Be afraid of nothing.

161
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:29,882
Your youth will last
such a little time,

162
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:32,318
and you can never
get it back.

163
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,019
As we grow older,

164
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,155
our memories are haunted
by the exquisite temptations

165
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:38,526
we hadn't the courage
to yield to.

166
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,662
The world is yours
for a season.

167
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:43,664
It would be tragic
if you realized too late,

168
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,135
as so many others do,

169
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:48,304
that there's only one thing
in the world worth having,

170
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:50,642
and that is youth.

171
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,177
Dorian Gray had never heard

172
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,647
the praise of folly
so eloquently expressed.

173
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,949
The creed of pleasure soared
into a philosophy of life

174
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:01,321
while Dorian stood as if
he were under a spell.

175
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:04,226
He felt afraid
of Lord Henry's ideas

176
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:06,695
and ashamed of himself
for being afraid.

177
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:09,831
It was as if he were
learning to know himself

178
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,601
for the first time,

179
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,771
as if a stranger
had revealed

180
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:15,940
his own secret thoughts to him.

181
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:16,908
For the first time,

182
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,378
he became conscious
of his youth

183
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,279
and of the fact

184
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,181
that one day
he would lose it.

185
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:24,918
My visit
hasn't been wasted.

186
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,656
I found a rare
and beautiful butterfly.

187
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:28,590
It's very unusual.

188
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:31,625
Don't you think
it's beautiful, Mr. Gray?

189
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:33,061
Yes, Lord Henry.

190
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:34,430
[Basil]
sit down, Dorian.

191
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:36,833
I'm glad you met
Lord Henry after all.

192
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,069
Are you glad,
Mr. Gray?

193
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,104
I'm glad now.

194
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,006
I wonder if
I shall always be glad.

195
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:45,077
Always? That's
a dreadful word.

196
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:46,212
Women are so fond it.

197
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:49,348
They spoil romance by trying
to make it last forever.

198
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,453
The only difference between
caprice and lifelong passion

199
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,823
is that caprice
lasts a little longer.

200
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,692
I believe our hostess
has appeared.

201
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,168
You're just
in time, darling,

202
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,504
to watch me sign
Dorian's painting.

203
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,140
Can I sign it, too?

204
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,008
I think you're
entitled to,

205
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,911
since you haven't
Missed a sitting.

206
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,548
"G" for "Gladys."

207
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,720
[Henry]
which do you prefer, Gladys--

208
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,122
Dorian Gray
or his picture?

209
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:22,491
I like Dorian.

210
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:23,793
You prefer him today,

211
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:25,795
but when you're
a young Lady,

212
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,798
you may prefer
the portrait.

213
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,534
It will look
as it does today,

214
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,237
but we shall
be changed--

215
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:35,038
your uncle and I
and even Dorian.

216
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,476
Dorian won't change.

217
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:39,145
Dorian will
stay just as he is

218
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:40,881
till I'm grown.

219
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,416
Won't you, Dorian?

220
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,753
Of course I shall,
darling.

221
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:46,822
You must say
good-bye, precious.

222
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:49,025
Nanny's waiting.
Come along.

223
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:50,827
Hurry. On your way.

224
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,429
What about me,
young Lady?

225
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,531
Has Dorian Gray
stolen you from me completely?

226
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,235
Good-bye,
Lord Henry.

227
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:59,171
When this is known,
I shall be

228
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,340
torn to shreds
in every drawing room.

229
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,343
Shouldn't a gentleman
remove his hat

230
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:06,212
in the presence
of a Lady, parker?

231
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:06,882
Ha ha!

232
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,250
I never
take off my hat

233
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,520
except when
I'm out of doors.

234
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,022
She'll be as lovely

235
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,458
as your sister
was, Basil.

236
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:15,726
Yes.

237
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,061
But I'm afraid Dorian
has stolen her heart

238
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,732
from me, too.

239
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,335
I must congratulate
you, Basil.

240
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:26,070
Look at yourself,
Mr. Gray.

241
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,534
As I grow old,

242
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:51,436
this picture will remain
always young.

243
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,709
If it were only
the other way...

244
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,611
If it were I who would
always be young

245
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:00,816
and the picture
that would grow old.

246
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,818
That would be hard lines
on your work, Basil.

247
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,789
I should object
strongly.

248
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,958
You oughtn't to express
such a wish around that cat.

249
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,262
It's an egyptian god,
and it's quite capable

250
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,867
of granting your wish.

251
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,002
Lord Henry is right.

252
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,804
When one loses
one's youth,

253
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:18,605
one loses
everything.

254
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:21,774
Perhaps a cup of tea will
bring you around, Dorian.

255
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,979
You will have
some too, Harry--

256
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,348
or do you object
to simple pleasures?

257
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,449
I adore
simple pleasures.

258
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,352
They're the last refuge
of the complex.

259
00:12:29,353 --> 00:12:32,421
It's more than a painting.
It's part of myself.

260
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:35,292
As soon as you're
varnished and framed,

261
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:36,395
you'll be sent home.

262
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,664
Do whatever you like
with yourself.

263
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:39,565
Send the egyptian cat.

264
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,634
The god and the picture
shouldn't be separated.

265
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:43,803
If Dorian wants it.

266
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,907
If only the picture
could change

267
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,775
and I could be always
what I am now.

268
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,879
For that, I would
give everything.

269
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,215
There's nothing
in the whole world

270
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:54,283
I would not give.

271
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:57,052
I would give my soul
for that.

272
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:12,740
Dorian began to venture alone
on warm summer evenings

273
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,909
into surroundings
which were strange to him.

274
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,447
[Piano playing]

275
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,517
filled with curiosity
about places and people

276
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:22,352
remote from his own experience,

277
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:25,455
he wandered to
the haugh world of London,

278
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:28,026
the words of Lord Henry

279
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,295
vibrating in his mind.

280
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:32,297
"Live! Let nothing be
lost upon you.

281
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,033
Be afraid of nothing."

282
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,646

the two turtles is honored
by the visit of a gentleman.

285
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,743
If you please, sir.

286

[Music resumes]

[organ playing]

290
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:48,629
I give you

291
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:52,231
the sweetheart
of the two turtles,

292
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,836
our own Sibyl Vane.

293
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:55,238
[Applause]

294
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:04,046
[piano playing]

295
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:11,523
the snow
was very plentiful

296
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,894
and crumbs were very few

297
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:17,964
when a weather-beaten
sparrow through

298
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,968
a mansion window flew

299
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:24,372
her eye fell
on a golden cage

300
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:28,444
a sweet love song
she heard

301
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,816
sung by a pet canary there

302
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:36,520
a handsome yellow bird

303
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:40,427
he said to her,
Miss sparrow

304
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:43,365
I've been struck
by cupid's arrow

305
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:46,333
will you share
my cage with me?

306
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,406
She looked up
at his castle

307
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:55,278
with its ribbon
and its tassel

308
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:59,449
and in plaintive tones
said she

309
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,193
good-bye,
little yellow bird

310
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:10,964
I'd rather
brave the cold

311
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:15,036
on a leafless tree

312
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:17,973

I'd gladly
introduce you, sir,

316
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,758
but she's proud.

317
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,426
She won't
meet anybody.

318
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:38,267
Come, my delightful dove!

319
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:41,136
Descend and make
a pilgrimage with me

320
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,441

the spoiled and petted
yellow bird

323
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:53,721
could scarce
believe it true

324
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,756
that a common sparrow
should refuse

325
00:16:57,526 --> 00:17:00,427
a bird
with blood so blue

326
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,532
he told her
the advantages

of riches and of gold

328
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:10,707
she answered
that her liberty

329
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:14,111
for gold
could not be sold

330
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,651
she said,
I must be going

331
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:20,187
but he cried,
no, no, it's snowing

332

and the wintry
windstorm blows

333
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,029

for without you,
'twould be dreary

335
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,772
but she only sighed,
ah, no

[all]
good-bye, little yellow bird

337
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:47,520
I'd gladly mate with you

338
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:52,026
I love you,
little yellow bird

339
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,231
but I love
my freedom, too

your daughter.

If you will permit me,
I have a request.

You're
very kind, sir.

will you sing

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,526
the little yellow bird
for me...Now?

360
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,694
[Mrs. Vane]
she will, sir-- gladly.

361
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:14,232
There's no one to play.
Everyone's gone.

362
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:17,167
I think I might manage
the accompaniment.

363
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,138
You will,
won't you, deary?

364
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:21,642
Yes...

365
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,413
On one condition.

366
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:29,785
Please.

367
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,494
I apologize
for my daughter.

368
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:52,545
So good-bye,
little yellow bird

369
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:56,216
I'd rather
brave the cold

370
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:00,922
on a leafless tree

371
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:04,427
than a prisoner be

372
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:08,265
in a cage of gold

373
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,550
[playing classical music]

374
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,726
it's wonderful.

375
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:50,394
Did...Did you
write it?

376
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,301
Frederic Chopin...

377
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:56,237
For a woman he loved.

378
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:58,106
Her name was George Sand.

379
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,643
Someday I'll
tell you about it.

380
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:03,210
I should
like that.

381
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,218
What did the music
mean to you?

382
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:12,591
I don't know.

383
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:15,225
It is full
of emotion,

384
00:22:15,262 --> 00:22:17,196
but it's not happy.

385
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:19,366
No, it's not happy.

386
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:21,901
Why was he unhappy?

387
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,578
Perhaps because
he felt his youth

388
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,147
slipping away from him.

389
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,015
What an odd thing
for you to say.

390
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:33,751
Why?

391
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,355
You're so young.

392
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,889
Yes...And you also.

393
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:44,298
What is
the music called?

394
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,233
Has it a name?

395
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,103
A kind of name.

396
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,770
It is called
prelude.

397
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,729
Is this how you watch
over Sibyl, mother?

398
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,930
James, your sister--

399
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,999
I wish I wasn't going
to australia.

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,202
If only my articles
hadn't been signed.

401
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:42,739
I want Sibyl to
make a brilliant marriage.

402
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,741
Actresses
often marry into upper classes.

403
00:23:44,742 --> 00:23:46,510
Who is this
young dandy?

404
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,646
I don't know,
but he's rich.

405
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,114
What's his name,
Sibyl?

406
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:51,450
What are
his intentions?

407
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:53,351
I don't know
his intentions,

408
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:55,989
but I know his name--
Sir Tristan.

409
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,624
You don't
know his name,

410
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,959
yet you
permitted him to...

411
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,763
You ought not to have
permitted such familiarity.

412
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:04,731
He is good.
There is no evil in him.

413
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,769
Did you see
his face?

414
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,237
No, but I wish
I had,

415
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,407
because if he
ever does you wrong, I'll kill him.

416
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:13,311
You're
foolish, Jim.

417
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,280
You talk like
the melodramas

418
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:16,515
mother used to
act in.

419
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:19,583
I received a great deal
of gratifying attention

420
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,586
in those days.

421
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:23,588
Mother,
watch over Sibyl while I'm gone.

422
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:23,958
Jim.

423
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,205
You're going away
tonight.

424
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:38,009
The ship will
take you far away

425
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,410
over
the dark waters.

426
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,412
Don't let me
remember you

427
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,948
angry and troubled.

428
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:54,361
That's better.

429
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,333
Can't you read
what people are

430
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,036
in their faces?

431
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:00,671
You think I'm silly

432
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,706
when I call him
Sir Tristan,

433
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:04,876
but to me
he's like one

434
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,511
of King Arthur's
knights

435
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:08,881
who took the vow
of chivalry

436
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,217
to battle against
all evildoers,

437
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,152
to defend the right,

438
00:25:13,153 --> 00:25:14,721
to protect
all women,

439
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,957
to be true in friendship

440
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,593
and faithful in love.

441
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:24,767
I've never heard
a sweeter warbler.

442
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,253
Little yellow bird.

443
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,928
Late as usual, Harry.

444
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:46,929
Forgive me,
aunt Agatha.

445
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,900
[Woman] punctuality is
the thief of time,

446
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,067
Harry says.

447
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:51,735
Victoria, darling.

448
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:54,406
I love coming
to your house, aunt Agatha.

449
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:56,441
It's one of
the few places

450
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:58,510
I'm likely to
meet my husband.

451
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,079
Oh. I'm always
dropping it.

452
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,416
Mr. Gray has something
to tell you.

453
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,517
We're dying to learn
what it is.

454
00:26:04,518 --> 00:26:06,887
It can wait until
luncheon is over.

455
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:09,758
[Agatha]
Harry, why do you want Mr. Gray

456
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,727
to give up
the east end?

457
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:13,129
He's a wonderful
musician.

458
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,097
They love
his playing.

459
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:17,099
The east end is
a very important problem.

460
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:19,270
It's the problem
of slavery,

461
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:22,272
and we try to solve it
by amusing the slaves.

462
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:24,277
[Man]
I suspect, Lord Henry,

463
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,179
we're interested
in the poor

464
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,547
to amuse ourselves,

465
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:29,216
especially
as we grow older

466
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:31,118
and are unfit
for other amusements.

467
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,488
Tell  me
how to become young again.

468
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:35,358
Can you remember
any great errors

469
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,827
you committed
in your youth, duchess?

470
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:38,495
A great many.

471
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,630
To regain one's youth,
one must repeat one's follies.

472
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,368
A dangerous theory.

473
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,535
One of life's secrets.

474
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,206
Most people die
of creeping common sense

475
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,240
and discover too late

476
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,142
that one never regrets
one's mistakes.

477
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,547
One pays
a terrible price.

478
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:55,316
We're overcharged
for everything.

479
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:57,652
One pays
in other ways than money.

480
00:26:57,653 --> 00:26:59,388
What sort of ways,
Sir Thomas?

481
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:01,891
I should fancy
in remorse, in suffering,

482
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,860
in the consciousness
of degradation.

483
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:05,696
No civilized man
regrets a pleasure,

484
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:08,764
and no uncivilized man
knows what a pleasure is.

485
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:10,869
I know what
pleasure is--

486
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,904
it's to adore someone.

487
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:14,939
I think I can guess
what you have to tell me.

488
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:16,911
[Laughter]

489
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:20,080
adoring someone is better
than being adored.

490
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:22,884
Women treat us like
humanity treats its gods.

491
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:25,387
They worship us
and keep bothering us

492
00:27:25,388 --> 00:27:27,023
to do something
for them.

493
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:28,624
[Agatha]
Harry, you're incorrigible.

494
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,362
Women give men
the very gold of their lives.

495
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:34,232
But they invariably
want it back in small change.

496
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:37,334
Women inspire us with the desire
to do masterpieces

497
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,339
and prevent us
from carrying them out.

498
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,107
I don't understand you.

499
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:44,011
You seem to
know us women awfully well.

500
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:45,412
I'm analyzing women
at present.

501
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,083
The subject is less
difficult than I believed.

502
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,151
Women represent the triumph
of matter over mind,

503
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:52,621
just as men represent

504
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:54,724
the triumph of mind
over morals.

505
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:57,595
These views
are horrifying, Lady Agatha!

506
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,463
I did not
expect to hear

507
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,366
the devil's advocate
at your table.

508
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,269
I apologize for
my intelligent remarks.

509
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,304
I'd forgotten you were
a member of parliament.

510
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:10,643
You will forgive me
if I leave at once.

511
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:13,814
Before the quail--
the first of the season?

512
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,785
I ordered them
especially for you.

513
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:18,387
Surely not
before the quail, Sir Thomas.

514
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:21,489
Think with the liberals
and eat with the tories.

515
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
[Victoria]
how men argue!

516
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:26,330
I never know what
they're talking about.

517
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:27,332
Do sit,
Sir Thomas.

518
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,501
Lord Henry's ideas
are demoralizing and delightful.

519
00:28:30,537 --> 00:28:33,372
They're not
to be taken seriously.

520
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:44,856
I confess.

521
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,691
I never could resist
Lady Agatha's quail.

522
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,731
What have you
to tell me?

523
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:53,766
From what you said,

524
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,235
my guess is you've
fAllen in love.

525
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,971
I'm engaged
to be married.

526
00:29:08,586 --> 00:29:10,087
Where are we going,
Harry?

527
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:11,521
Grosvenor square,
number 7.

528
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:13,424
It's Dorian
we're going to see?

529
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:16,161
We'll pick him up,
then see his fiancee.

530
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:17,429
Dorian, engaged?
To whom?

531
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,932
To an actress
in a cheap vaudeville.

532
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,468
With dyed hair
and a painted face.

533
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,937
Don't run down
such things.

534
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:25,940
There's extraordinary
charm in them.

535
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:27,442
Surely you can't
be serious.

536
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:30,311
I hope I shall never

00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,337
There was no doubt

715
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,373
that the whole expression
had altered.

716
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,445
The lines of cruelty
about the mouth

717
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:24,415
were unmistakable.

718
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:41,003
There was no such expression
on his  face.

719
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,144
[Thinking]
if only the picture

720
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:46,912
could change

721
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:49,715
and I could be always
as I am now.

722
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,717
For that, I would
give everything.

723
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,155
There's nothing
in the whole world

724
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:55,389
I would not give.

725
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,324
I would give my soul
for that.

726
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,431
But surely his wish
had not been fulfilled.

727
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:05,802
Such things
were impossible.

728
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,838
It was monstrous
even to think of it.

729
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,945
What if someone else
observed the horrible change--

730
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:15,682
his valet, perhaps?

731
00:42:15,683 --> 00:42:19,018
What if Basil Hallward asked
to look at his own picture?

732
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:28,966
But he was
being ridiculous.

733
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:30,701
This was
a mere hallucination--

734
00:42:30,702 --> 00:42:33,869
an illusion brought on
by his troubled senses.

735
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:36,708
The picture
had not changed.

736
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:38,944
He was mad to think so.

737
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:41,880
A painted canvas
could not alter.

738
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,318
He would look at it again

739
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,921
after he had slept,
when he was calmer,

740
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:50,057
and he would laugh
at this fantastic idea.

741
00:42:53,964 --> 00:42:54,864
But in the afternoon

742
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:58,034
when he returned
to examine the portrait again,

743
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,537
fantastic as the idea was,

744
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:02,840
his memory of that cruel look
was disturbingly vivid.

745
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,491
It was true.

746
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,326
The expression
had altered.

747
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,764
There was no doubt of it.

748
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,867
It was incredible,
and yet, it was a fact.

749
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,805
Was this portrait
to become for him

750
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:30,243
the emblem
of his own conscience?

751
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,345
Would it teach him
to loathe his own soul?

752
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:35,683
But if this painting

753
00:43:35,684 --> 00:43:38,487
was to be his conscience
made visible,

754
00:43:38,488 --> 00:43:40,256
he would let it
instruct him.

755
00:43:40,257 --> 00:43:43,260
He would give it no reason
to reproach him.

756
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:46,195
He would live
purely and nobly.

757
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:49,501
He had been cruel
to Sibyl Vane,

758
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,436
but he could
make that right.

759
00:43:51,437 --> 00:43:53,105
She could still
be his wife.

760
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:56,176
He would marry her.
They could be happy together.

761
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:59,213
He implored her forgiveness.
He blamed himself.

762
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:02,348
He gave way to the luxury
of self-reproach.

763
00:44:02,484 --> 00:44:04,520
When he finished
the letter,

764
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,522
he felt that
he had been forgiven.

765
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:10,460

768
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:17,203

769
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:20,004
I'll not go away
until I see you.

771
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:30,384
Dorian, let me in!

772
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:36,894
You shouldn't
lock yourself in.

773
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:38,763
I'm sorry
for it all.

774
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:40,531
You mean
about Sibyl Vane.

775
00:44:40,532 --> 00:44:41,600
Yes, of course.

776
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,702
It's all right.
I'm grateful to you.

777
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:46,005
I've learned to know
myself better.

778
00:44:46,006 --> 00:44:47,607
From now on, I'll do

779
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:49,143
what my conscience
bids me.

780
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,713
What on earth are
you talking about?

781
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:53,214
I'm going to marry
Sibyl Vane.

782
00:44:53,215 --> 00:44:56,450
You're going to say
something cynical about marriage.

783
00:44:56,553 --> 00:44:57,620
Don't say it.

784
00:44:57,621 --> 00:44:59,657
I asked Sibyl
to marry me.

785
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,625
I won't break
my word.

786
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:03,561
Then you don't know.

787
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:03,929
Know what?

788
00:45:04,129 --> 00:45:06,997
Haven't you read
the morning paper?

789
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:09,466
No, I haven't.

790
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:17,010
What is it, Harry?
What's happened?

791
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,021
Sibyl Vane is dead.

792
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:47,549
That's why I hurried
here to see you.

793
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:50,154
I wanted
to see you first.

794
00:45:50,155 --> 00:45:51,322
I assumed you knew.

795
00:45:51,323 --> 00:45:53,624
Don't get mixed up
in the inquest.

796
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,626
They don't
know your name at the theater.

797
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,798
Did Sibyl...

798
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,199
Tell me everything,
Harry.

799
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,369
It was obviously
not an accident.

800
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,173
It must be
put that way to the public.

801
00:46:05,174 --> 00:46:07,509
12:30, She was
leaving the theater

802
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,643
with her mother.

803
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:11,113
She went back to
her dressing room.

804
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:13,817
They found her lying
on the floor.

805
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,352
She'd swallowed
something--

806
00:46:15,353 --> 00:46:16,720
by mistake,
they say.

807
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:19,056
She died
instantaneously.

808
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:20,259
It's tragic,
of course,

809
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,561
but you mustn't
brood over it.

810
00:46:22,562 --> 00:46:23,829
You must see it

811
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,365
in its proper
perspective.

812
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,501
Put it out
of your mind.

813
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:28,502
Come dine with me.

814
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:30,538
Afterwards, we'll
see Don Giovanni.

815
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,673
You can come
to my sister's box.

816
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:34,676
So I have murdered
Sibyl Vane,

817
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:37,079
as surely as if
I'd cut her throat.

818
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,783
I can't see why you
should blame yourself.

819
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:41,318
She thought
she'd lost you,

820
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:42,920
but no woman
destroys herself

821
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,522
who isn't
already unbalanced.

822
00:46:44,523 --> 00:46:45,690
Where's your sherry?

823
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:47,259
If you'd married
this girl,

824
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,496
you'd both have
been wretched.

825
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:50,830
It would have failed.

826
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:51,965
I remember
your saying

827
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:55,001
good resolutions
are always made too late.

828
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,704
Mine certainly were.

829
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:58,808
View this tragedy
as an episode

830
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:00,543
in the spectacle
of life.

831
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:02,378
What is it
that has happened?

832
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:04,614
Someone has killed herself
for love of you.

833
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:06,717
I wish I'd had
such an experience.

834
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:08,686
The women who
have admired me

835
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:10,555
have always
insisted on living on

836
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:13,426
long after I've ceased
to care for them.

837
00:47:13,427 --> 00:47:15,194
They become
stout and tedious.

838
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:17,297
They go in
for reminiscences--

839
00:47:17,298 --> 00:47:18,799
that awful memory
of woman.

840
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,001
I found myself next
to such a woman the other night.

841
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:24,239
She had once proposed

842
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,908
to sacrifice
the world for me.

843
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,044
That moment fills one
with the terror of eternity.

844
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,747
It happened years ago.

845
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,683
She said I'd
spoiled her life.

846
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,752
However, she ate
an enormous dinner.

847
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:37,255
No woman would
have done for me

848
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:38,858
what Sibyl
did for you.

849
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,462
Will you dine
with me tonight?

850
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:43,097
I don't feel up to it.

851
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:45,967
Perhaps
you'll join me at the opera.

852
00:47:45,968 --> 00:47:48,504
My sister's
box number is 27.

Yes, sir. Is there
any message, sir?

No. No. I'll come by
in the morning.

In the morning,

861

the consolation of his friend,
nor his reproaches.

862

His pride
and his sense of guilt

863
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:56,221

an air of indifference.

master of himself

can end a sorrow
as easily as he invents pleasures.

at the mercy of my emotions.

exactly the same,

you would have seen how
deeply I was affected.

I was going through.

00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,840
No one can.

892
00:50:02,841 --> 00:50:04,576
This isn't you
talking, Dorian.

893
00:50:04,577 --> 00:50:05,978
These are
Harry's ideas.

894
00:50:05,979 --> 00:50:08,214
It has nothing
to do with Harry.

895
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:11,250
Harry didn't give you
that yellow book I saw?

896
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:14,388
It's vile, evil,
corrupt, decadent.

897
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:15,557
I detest it.

898
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:18,458
What would you
like me to read, Basil?

899
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:26,070
Since you ask me...

900
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:27,505
The light of Asia.

901
00:50:27,506 --> 00:50:29,074
I'm never
without it.

902
00:50:29,075 --> 00:50:30,309
The story of Buddha?

903
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,945
The story of Buddha,
a good man.

904
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,282
Promise me
you'll read it.

905
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:35,649
I promise.

906
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:41,823
You've done
a sketch of Sibyl.

907
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:44,126
Charming.
May I have it?

908
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:44,493
Of course.

909
00:50:45,028 --> 00:50:46,963
I must go now,
Dorian.

910
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:49,733
I'm relieved to find you
in good spirits

911
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,168
in spite of
what's happened.

912
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:54,070
It's good of you
to be so concerned.

913
00:50:55,174 --> 00:50:57,476
Before I go,
I'd like to look

914
00:50:57,477 --> 00:51:00,045
at my painting of you.

915
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:02,783
There's a screen
in front of it.

916
00:51:02,784 --> 00:51:04,885
I thought the room
looked different.

917
00:51:04,886 --> 00:51:06,354
The light was
too strong.

918
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:09,423
Surely not.
It's an admirable place for it.

919
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:15,366
[Dorian]
wait.

920
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,201
You must not
look at it.

921
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:20,137
Not look at my work?
You're not serious.

922
00:51:20,173 --> 00:51:21,106
Why shouldn't I?

923
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:22,675
I don't offer
any explanation,

924
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:25,644
but if you
try to look at that picture,

925
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,848
I'll never speak
to you again.

926
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:30,418
What on earth is
the matter with you?

927
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:32,520
I'm planning to
exhibit it next month.

928
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:35,657
You told me
a month ago you'd never exhibit it.

929
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:38,862
You told Harry
the same thing.

930
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,231
At that time,
the painting had

931
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:42,767
a strange
fascination for me.

932
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,635
It seemed to have
a life of its own.

933
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,373
It affected me so much,

934
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:50,341
I felt I couldn't
let it be seen publicly.

935
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:51,945
Perhaps you've seen

936
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:53,614
the same mysterious
quality in it.

937
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:56,584
Have you noticed
something curious in the painting--

938
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:59,586
something that
at first did not strike you

939
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:02,693
but revealed itself
to you suddenly?

940
00:52:02,694 --> 00:52:04,027
I see you did.

941
00:52:04,028 --> 00:52:05,662
I saw something in it--

942
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:08,632
something that seemed
to be very curious.

943
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:10,101
You were right.

944
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:13,137
There can be something
fatal about a portrait.

945
00:52:15,108 --> 00:52:17,477
I think I understand
what you feel,

946
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:19,079
and I respect
your wishes.

947
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,149
Perhaps someday you'll
recover from it as I did.

948
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:25,486
I'll certainly not let it
destroy our friendship.

949
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:27,757
I'm glad of that.

950
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:30,259
Good-bye, Dorian.

951
00:52:30,662 --> 00:52:33,129
Good-bye, Basil.

952
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:37,870
It had been mad of him

953
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:41,073
to allow the thing to remain,
even for an hour,

954
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:44,245
in a room to which
his friends had access.

955
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:47,514
Henceforth, he must be
on his guard against everyone.

956
00:52:56,795 --> 00:52:59,997
At the top of the house
was his old schoolroom,

957
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,501
which had not
been used for years.

958
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:05,338
No one ever entered it.

959
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,507
Nothing was in it
but old schoolbooks and toys

960
00:53:08,843 --> 00:53:09,911
gathering dust
and cobwebs.

961
00:53:09,912 --> 00:53:13,079
The picture could be
safely hidden away there.

962
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:15,117
He would lock it up.

963
00:53:15,118 --> 00:53:17,620
He himself
would keep the key.

964
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:20,257
There was no need
for the servants

965
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:22,959
ever to enter the room.

966
00:53:45,424 --> 00:53:48,225
He would have to
let victor go

967
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:49,093
and the others.

968
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:52,229
He must bring new servants
into the house.

969
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:04,680
In this room,

970
00:54:04,681 --> 00:54:07,983
every moment of his childhood
and its stainless purity

971
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:09,219
came back to him.

972
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,488
Here, among the innocent
souvenirs of his childhood,

973
00:54:12,925 --> 00:54:14,726
the hideous portrait

974
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:17,495
would be forever hidden away.

975
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,467
The face painted
in the canvas

976
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:23,136
could grow bestial,
sodden, and unclean,

977
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:26,039
and no one
would ever see it--

978
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,610
no one...Except himself.

979
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:32,849
He was to have
eternal youth

980
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:36,051
while the portrait bore
the burden of his shame.

981
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,027
He was caught
in an evil destiny.

982
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:50,939
As the years passed,

983
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,974
the miracle of Dorian's
changeless youth

984
00:54:52,975 --> 00:54:55,377
caused wonder
but rarely suspicion.

985
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:57,013
Even those who had heard

986
00:54:57,014 --> 00:54:58,982
the most evil things
against him--

987
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:01,485
strange rumors
about his mode of life

988
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:03,855
which became the chatter
of the clubs--

989
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:06,659
could not believe
anything to his dishonor

990
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,960
when they saw him.

991
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:09,328
He had the look of one

992
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:12,497
who had kept himself
unspotted from the world.

993
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:18,140
But while
he fascinated many,

994
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:21,077
there were not a few
who distrusted him.

995
00:55:21,078 --> 00:55:23,413
Curious stories
were current about him.

996
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:26,549
It was rumored
he'd been seen in a low den

997
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:29,420
in the distant parts
of whitechapel.

998
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:31,723
His extraordinary absences
became notorious,

999
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:34,093
and when he reappeared
again in society,

1000
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:36,730
men would whisper
to each other in corners

1001
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,366
or look at him
with cold, searching eyes.

1002
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:42,570
Some of those who had been
most intimate with him

1003
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,275
appeared, after a time,
to shun him.

1004
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,578
Women who, for his sake,
had set convention at defiance

1005
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,215
would seem to go pale

1006
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:53,351
if Dorian Gray
entered the room.

1007
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:56,520
He could not endure
to be long out of England

1008
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:59,459
or to be separated
from the picture.

1009
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,395
He was afraid
that during his absence

1010
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:03,564
someone might gain access

1011
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:05,900
to the room
where it was hidden.

1012
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:08,903
Then suddenly,
some night he would go down

1013
00:56:08,904 --> 00:56:11,641
to dreadful places
near Blue Gate Fields

1014
00:56:11,642 --> 00:56:14,277
and stay there
day after day.

1015
00:56:14,278 --> 00:56:16,746
[Piano playing]

1016
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:58,365
when he had recovered
from visits to the abyss,

1017
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:00,903
he would stand in front
of the picture,

1018
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:03,072
sometimes loathing it
and himself

1019
00:57:03,073 --> 00:57:04,574
but filled at other times

1020
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:06,510
with that pride
of individualism

1021
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:09,546
that is
half the fascination of evil.

1022
00:57:09,615 --> 00:57:11,249
He would examine
with minute care

1023
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,386
the hideous lines that scarred
the wrinkling forehead

1024
00:57:14,387 --> 00:57:17,390
or crawled around
the heavy, sensual mouth,

1025
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:19,527
wondering which were
more horrible--

1026
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:22,529
the signs of sin
or the signs of age.

1027
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,570
He found reasons
to justify his actions.

1028
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:30,006
He told himself
that man was a being

1029
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:32,509
with myriad lives
and myriad sensations.

1030
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,579
To live the simple,
sincere, honest life

1031
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:38,050
was hardly
to live at all.

1032
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:41,054
Was insincerity
such a terrible thing?

1033
00:57:41,055 --> 00:57:42,522
Dorian thought not.

1034
00:57:42,523 --> 00:57:43,423
Twas merely a method

1035
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:46,593
by which we could multiply
our personalities.

1036
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,363
Yet, there was one person

1037
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,467
towards whom he found it
difficult to be insincere.

1038
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,937
It was Basil Hallward's
niece Gladys,

1039
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:57,006
who had loved him
since she was a child.

1040
00:57:57,041 --> 00:58:00,010
So, good-bye,
little yellow bird

1041
00:58:03,016 --> 00:58:05,884
I'd rather
brave the cold

1042
00:58:09,759 --> 00:58:12,425
on a leafless tree

1043
00:58:13,196 --> 00:58:15,864
than a prisoner be

1044
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:19,201
in a cage of gold

1045
00:58:22,974 --> 00:58:25,210
I was close by
and came in.

1046
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:28,178
Found this old song
in your piano bench.

1047
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:28,948
It's charming.

1048
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:31,850
So is the face
my uncle sketched on it.

1049
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,222
He did do it,
didn't he?

1050
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,890
I know his style
so well.

1051
00:58:37,593 --> 00:58:40,194
Did she sing this song?

1052
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:42,198
Who is she?

1053
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:44,067
Do tell me about her.

1054
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:45,903
She died
many years ago,

1055
00:58:45,904 --> 00:58:48,704
when you were only
a little girl.

1056
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:54,813
Did you love her
very much, Dorian?

1057
00:58:55,382 --> 00:58:55,650
Yes.

1058
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:02,925
Good-bye, Dorian.

1059
00:59:02,926 --> 00:59:05,261
I'm looking forward
to your party.

1060
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,863
It will be wonderful.

1061
00:59:15,241 --> 00:59:18,176
I'm not as lovely
as that picture, am I?

1062
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:19,479
Of course not.

1063
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,848
I think
I've discovered

1064
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,083
why Dorian
hasn't proposed to me.

1065
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:24,786
I've decided what to do.

1066
00:59:24,787 --> 00:59:26,020
What have you decided?

1067
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,889
I'm going to ask him
to marry me--

1068
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:30,092
tonight, perhaps.

1069
00:59:30,093 --> 00:59:31,294
What about David stone?

1070
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:33,797
He wouldn't take you
to Dorian's party

1071
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:35,632
if he knew
your intentions.

1072
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:36,934
Of course he would,

1073
00:59:36,935 --> 00:59:39,304
but I don't intend
to tell him.

1074
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:40,606
No, don't tell David.

1075
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:42,909
You cad!
I never thoughtu'd eavesdrop.

1076
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,545
Don't be alarmed
about Dorian, Mr. Hallward.

1077
00:59:45,546 --> 00:59:46,613
Gladys will marry me.

1078
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:48,716
I have nothing
to say about it?

1079
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:50,919
I wouldn't let you
marry that devil.

1080
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,554
Don't say anything
against him.

1081
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,290
There are others
to say it for me.

1082
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,792
There's no evil
in Dorian.

1083
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:59,728
Anybody can see that
by looking at him.

1084
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:00,964
He hasn't asked you.

1085
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:02,901
I'll ask him myself,
tonight.

1086
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:04,302
In front
of those people?

1087
01:00:04,303 --> 01:00:07,238
I'll get him alone.
It's a big house.

1088
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:08,274
Good night, sir.

1089
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,875
Good night,
David.

1090
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:30,567
[Singing in foreign language]

1091
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:00,640
what's wrong, Dorian?

1092
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:03,176
Is there something
I don't know about?

1093
01:01:03,177 --> 01:01:04,512
You must have heard

1094
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:06,481
the stories
they tell of me.

1095
01:01:06,482 --> 01:01:07,849
Don't they
frighten you?

1096
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,151
I don't believe them.

1097
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:10,953
Suppose I told you
they're true?

1098
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:13,922
I will never believe
anything evil of you.

1099
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:18,796
What do
 you  know of evil?

1100
01:01:18,797 --> 01:01:21,632
I only know
there is none in you.

1101
01:01:22,168 --> 01:01:24,871
If you had some
great trouble, Dorian,

1102
01:01:24,872 --> 01:01:26,973
I would
want to share it.

1103
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,643
If I were to marry you,

1104
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:31,146
it would be
an incredible wickedness.

1105
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:34,115
Is that a way of saying
you don't love me?

1106
01:01:39,024 --> 01:01:41,423
If you like.

1107
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,720
It's very beautiful, Dorian.

1108
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:04,088
Thank you.

1109
01:02:06,825 --> 01:02:09,560
Would you
find David for me?

1110
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:14,066
I must go now.

1111
01:02:27,085 --> 01:02:29,585
[Doorknob rattles]

1112
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,430
I've been exploring
your house, Dorian.

1113
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:38,965
It's better
than a museum.

1114
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:42,101
You must have some priceless
possessions in that room

1115
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,839
if you keep them
locked up.

1116
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,974
May I see them sometime?

1117
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:49,143
What rare things have you
stored away there, Dorian?

1118
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:53,316
I suspected as much.

1119
01:02:53,317 --> 01:02:56,052
I want to leave
now, David.

1120
01:02:56,187 --> 01:02:56,555
Of course.

1121
01:02:57,489 --> 01:02:59,124
Good night,
Dorian.

1122
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,158
Good night.

1123
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:01,193
Good night.

1124
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,594
Good night.

1125
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,596
It was november 9th,
the eve of his 38th birthday,

1126
01:03:30,965 --> 01:03:32,767
as Dorian often remembered
afterwards.

1127
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:36,002
He was walking home about 11:00
from Lord Henry's.

1128
01:03:36,205 --> 01:03:39,507
A strange sense of fear
for which he could not account

1129
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:42,679
came over him at the sight
of Basil Hallward

1130
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,015
and prevented him from making
any sign of recognition.

1131
01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:47,152
Dorian!

1132
01:03:47,687 --> 01:03:50,621
I thought it was you--
or your fur coat--

1133
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:52,725
but I wasn't sure.

1134
01:03:52,726 --> 01:03:54,527
Didn't you
recognize me?

1135
01:03:54,528 --> 01:03:55,195
In this fog?

1136
01:03:55,196 --> 01:03:56,963
I can't recognize
grosvenor square.

1137
01:03:56,964 --> 01:03:59,233
My house must be
somewhere about,

1138
01:03:59,234 --> 01:04:00,202
but I'm not certain.

1139
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,671
I've been waiting
for you since 9:00.

1140
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,873
I told your man
to go to bed.

1141
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,476
I'm off to Paris
tonight.

1142
01:04:06,477 --> 01:04:09,179
I wanted to see you
before I left.

1143
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,815
I'm sorry
you're going away.

1144
01:04:10,816 --> 01:04:12,683
I suppose you'll
be back soon?

1145
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:15,187
I shall be gone
for several months.

1146
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:17,056
I'm taking
a studio in Paris

1147
01:04:17,057 --> 01:04:19,958
to finish a picture
I have in my head.

1148
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,162
Gladys will join me
later on.

1149
01:04:22,163 --> 01:04:24,431
May I come in
for a moment?

1150
01:04:24,432 --> 01:04:25,933
Won't you Miss
your train?

1151
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:28,170
It leaves at 12:15.
It's only 11:00.

1152
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:31,105
I was going to the club
to look for you.

1153
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,276
Luggage won't delay me.
I've sent on my things.

1154
01:04:34,712 --> 01:04:35,980
I have only this bag.

1155
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:38,982
Come in, or the fog
will get into the house.

1156
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,555
I hope you're not
going to talk

1157
01:04:43,556 --> 01:04:44,891
about anything serious.

1158
01:04:44,892 --> 01:04:46,426
Nothing is serious
nowadays--

1159
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:47,561
at least,
nothing should be.

1160
01:04:47,562 --> 01:04:50,764
What I have to say
is serious, Dorian.

1161
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:52,066
Don't frown like that.

1162
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:55,069
You make it so much
more difficult for me.

1163
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:59,576
I hope it's not
about myself.

1164
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:00,544
I'm tired of myself.

1165
01:05:00,545 --> 01:05:03,613
It is about yourself,
and I must say it to you.

1166
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,819
I'll only keep you
half an hour.

1167
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,454
You sound
terrifying, Basil.

1168
01:05:08,455 --> 01:05:10,824
It's for your sake
I'm speaking.

1169
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:12,092
I think you should know

1170
01:05:12,093 --> 01:05:15,128
the things that are being
said against you.

1171
01:05:16,966 --> 01:05:18,734
I don't want to know them.

1172
01:05:18,735 --> 01:05:20,770
I love scandals
about other people,

1173
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:23,606
but scandals about myself
don't interest me.

1174
01:05:23,607 --> 01:05:24,607
They lack novelty.

1175
01:05:24,608 --> 01:05:27,644
You must be interested
in your own reputation.

1176
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:30,648
Mind you, I don't
believe these rumors.

1177
01:05:30,716 --> 01:05:33,617
I can't believe them
when I see you.

1178
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:35,722
There aren't
any secret vices.

1179
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,624
Such things
write themselves

1180
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:38,827
across a man's face.

1181
01:05:38,828 --> 01:05:40,462
You, with your
untroubled youth--

1182
01:05:40,463 --> 01:05:43,497
I find it hard to credit
anything against you.

1183
01:05:43,532 --> 01:05:46,135
When I hear these things
people whisper,

1184
01:05:46,136 --> 01:05:48,372
I don't know
what to say.

1185
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:49,173
I absolve you

1186
01:05:49,174 --> 01:05:51,175
from the necessity
of defending me.

1187
01:05:51,176 --> 01:05:52,543
You can't dismiss
these charges.

1188
01:05:52,544 --> 01:05:55,612
Why does the duke leave
a room when you enter?

1189
01:05:55,715 --> 01:05:58,184
Not because he knows
about my life,

1190
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:00,019
but because
I know about his.

1191
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,222
Why are your friendships
fatal to people?

1192
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:04,359
That boy in the guards
committed suicide.

1193
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,028
What about Adrian Singleton
and Lord wayne's son?

1194
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,999
What gentleman would be
seen with either of them?

1195
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,803
The boy in the guards
loved a woman

1196
01:06:12,804 --> 01:06:15,206
he felt he couldn't
live without.

1197
01:06:15,207 --> 01:06:15,940
Am I to blame?

1198
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:18,976
Wayne's son marries
a woman no one receives.

1199
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:19,744
Is that my fault?

1200
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:22,515
Adrian writes
his friend's name across a bill.

1201
01:06:22,516 --> 01:06:23,749
Am I his keeper?

1202
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,084
One can judge a man

1203
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:27,354
by the effect he has
on his friends.

1204
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:30,657
Yours seem filled
with an insatiable madness for pleasure.

1205
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:33,660
And when I think how
fond Gladys is of you...

1206
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:38,201
What has Gladys
to do with it?

1207
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,469
Nothing, I hope,

1208
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,305
and nothing
in the future,

1209
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:43,207
if I can prevent it.

1210
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,242
I'm told things

1211
01:06:44,243 --> 01:06:46,012
it seems
impossible to doubt.

1212
01:06:46,013 --> 01:06:48,515
Lord wallace was
my friend at Oxford.

1213
01:06:48,516 --> 01:06:51,483
He showed me a letter
his wife had written

1214
01:06:51,753 --> 01:06:53,154
when she was dying.

1215
01:06:53,155 --> 01:06:54,488
Your name was implicated

1216
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:57,491
in the most terrible
confession I ever read.

1217
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:59,562
I told him
that I knew you,

1218
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:02,597
and you were incapable
of anything of the kind.

1219
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:04,734
No. Do I know you?

1220
01:07:04,735 --> 01:07:06,336
Before I could
answer that,

1221
01:07:06,337 --> 01:07:09,138
I should have
to see your soul.

1222
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:13,512
To see my soul.

1223
01:07:13,513 --> 01:07:15,482
Yes,
to see your soul,

1224
01:07:15,483 --> 01:07:18,150
but only god
can do that.

1225
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:29,131
You shall see it
yourself, tonight.

1226
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:33,371
Why shouldn't you
look at it?

1227
01:07:33,372 --> 01:07:34,506
It's your own handiwork.

1228
01:07:34,507 --> 01:07:37,508
You can tell the world
about it afterward,

1229
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:38,878
if you like.

1230
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,179
No one will believe you.

1231
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,783
You've chattered enough
about corruption.

1232
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:44,385
Now you'll look at it.

1233
01:07:44,386 --> 01:07:45,653
I'll show you my soul.

1234
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:48,688
I can make no sense out
of what you're saying.

1235
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:52,027
I only ask you
to give me some answer

1236
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:54,064
to the horrible charges
against you.

1237
01:07:54,065 --> 01:07:57,133
Tell me they're untrue,
and I'll believe you.

1238
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:58,369
Come upstairs, Basil.

1239
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,138
I keep a diary
from day to day.

1240
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,875
I'll show it to you.

1241
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:04,544
I don't want to read
anything.

1242
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:07,414
I want a plain answer
to my question.

1243
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:09,416
You'll find that
upstairs.

1244
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:12,152
You won't have to
read long.

1245
01:08:44,896 --> 01:08:47,231
You're the one man
in the world

1246
01:08:47,232 --> 01:08:50,200
who's entitled to know
everything about me.

1247
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:54,138
You've had more
to do with my life

1248
01:08:55,276 --> 01:08:57,743
than you think.

1249
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:06,521
You think it's only god
who sees the soul?

1250
01:09:42,369 --> 01:09:45,771
In spite of the indescribable
corruption of the portrait,

1251
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:49,210
Basil was still able
to recognize

1252
01:09:49,211 --> 01:09:51,879
his painting of Dorian.

1253
01:09:57,955 --> 01:10:00,090
It was from within,
apparently,

1254
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:03,060
that the foulness
and horror came.

1255
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,099
It was as if
some moral leprosy

1256
01:10:08,402 --> 01:10:11,136
were eating the thing away.

1257
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:19,980
He could not believe
he had made this portrait,

1258
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,785
yet there was his name,

1259
01:10:21,786 --> 01:10:24,620
just as he had
painted it.

1260
01:10:46,818 --> 01:10:48,452
But this is monstrous.

1261
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,721
It's beyond nature,
beyond reason.

1262
01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:52,657
What does it mean?

1263
01:10:52,658 --> 01:10:55,559
On the day you finished
this painting,

1264
01:10:55,762 --> 01:10:56,595
I made a wish.

1265
01:10:56,596 --> 01:10:59,865
Perhaps
 you  would call it a prayer.

1266
01:11:02,203 --> 01:11:03,938
My wish was granted.

1267
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:06,907
You told me you had
destroyed my painting.

1268
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:08,710
I was wrong.

1269
01:11:08,711 --> 01:11:10,513
It has destroyed me.

1270
01:11:10,514 --> 01:11:12,850
It has the eyes
of a devil.

1271
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,751
Each of us has heaven
and hell in him.

1272
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:17,254
If this is true,

1273
01:11:17,255 --> 01:11:20,223
if this is what you've
done with your life,

1274
01:11:20,293 --> 01:11:23,260
it is far worse than
anything said of you.

1275
01:11:27,068 --> 01:11:29,903
Do you know
how to pray, Dorian?

1276
01:11:36,346 --> 01:11:39,448
What is it we were taught
to say in our boyhood--

1277
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:42,053
lead us not
into temptation,

1278
01:11:42,054 --> 01:11:43,388
forgive us our sins,

1279
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:44,890
wash away
our iniquities.

1280
01:11:44,891 --> 01:11:46,693
Let us say them
together.

1281
01:11:46,694 --> 01:11:47,860
It's too late, Basil.

1282
01:11:47,861 --> 01:11:50,497
The prayer
of your pride was answered.

1283
01:11:50,498 --> 01:11:52,566
The prayer
of your repentance

1284
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:55,135
may be answered also.

1285
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:58,040
Do you think
I haven't tried?

1286
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,909
I tell you,
it's no use.

1287
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,878
Isn't there a verse
somewhere--

1288
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:03,847
"though your sins
be as scarlet,

1289
01:12:03,848 --> 01:12:06,716
yet I will make them
white as snow"?

1290
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:11,290
Only last week,
Gladys recalled

1291
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:13,760
the day this painting
was finished.

1292
01:12:13,761 --> 01:12:16,030
She remembered
putting her initial

1293
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:17,231
under my signature.

1294
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:20,033
There it is,
just as she made it.

1295
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,771
If she could see it now.

1296
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:29,445
I can still pray,
Dorian, if you can't.

1297
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:33,885
Gladys must never know,

1298
01:12:33,886 --> 01:12:35,153
yet sometime, somehow,

1299
01:12:35,154 --> 01:12:38,155
Basil might reveal
his secret to her,

1300
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:40,527
the one person
in the world

1301
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:43,662
whose good opinion was
indispensable to him.

1302
01:12:45,134 --> 01:12:48,237
An uncontrollable feeling
of hatred for Basil

1303
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:49,605
came over him,

1304
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:50,807
together with a terror

1305
01:12:50,808 --> 01:12:53,176
of the knowledge
he had given him

1306
01:12:53,177 --> 01:12:56,112
and the use
he might make of it.

1307
01:12:56,315 --> 01:12:57,048
Panic seized him.

1308
01:12:57,049 --> 01:13:00,284
He felt like a hunted animal--
cornered, desperate.

1309
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:04,758
Oh!

1310
01:14:17,484 --> 01:14:19,786
It was as if the painting

1311
01:14:19,787 --> 01:14:22,655
had sweated
a dew of blood.

1312
01:14:43,016 --> 01:14:46,084
He felt that he had
struck a mortal blow

1313
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:49,689
not only at his friend,
but at himself.

1314
01:14:50,793 --> 01:14:52,962
It seemed to him
unbearable

1315
01:14:52,963 --> 01:14:56,097
that what he had done
could never be undone.

1316
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:17,893
Basil was dead.

1317
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:21,163
Men were strangled in England
for what he had done,

1318
01:15:21,999 --> 01:15:25,135
and yet, what evidence
was there against him?

1319
01:15:25,136 --> 01:15:27,505
Basil had left the house
at 11:00.

1320
01:15:27,506 --> 01:15:30,176
No one had seen him
come in again.

1321
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:32,845
Most of the servants
were at Selby.

1322
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:34,414
His valet had gone to bed.

1323
01:15:34,415 --> 01:15:37,351
Paris! It was to Paris
that Basil had gone,

1324
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:40,487
by the midnight train,
as he had intended.

1325
01:16:22,343 --> 01:16:24,776
[Door opens]

1326
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,351
I'm sorry to wake you,
francis.

1327
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:30,853
I forgot my latchkey.

1328
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:32,187
What time is it?

1329
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:33,489
Half past 12:00,
sir.

1330
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,259
Wake me at 9:00
in the morning.

1331
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:38,095
I have work to do.

1332
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:38,496
Yes, sir.

1333
01:16:40,532 --> 01:16:42,600
Did anyone call
this evening?

1334
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:43,935
Mr. Hallward, sir.

1335
01:16:43,936 --> 01:16:45,003
He stayed till 11:00

1336
01:16:45,004 --> 01:16:47,507
and then went
to catch his train.

1337
01:16:47,508 --> 01:16:49,175
He was leaving
for Paris.

1338
01:16:49,176 --> 01:16:50,543
Did he leave
any message?

1339
01:16:50,544 --> 01:16:53,214
He said he would
write you from Paris

1340
01:16:53,215 --> 01:16:56,050
if he didn't find you
at your club.

1341
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:57,219
Thank you, francis.

1342
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,054
Is there anything
more, sir?

1343
01:16:59,055 --> 01:17:00,189
I'm writing a letter.

1344
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:02,358
Deliver it early
in the morning

1345
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:03,493
to Mr. Allen Campbell.

1346
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,097
You'll find the address
on the envelope.

1347
01:17:06,098 --> 01:17:08,799
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.

1348
01:17:10,604 --> 01:17:13,671
When Allen Campbell
received his letter,

1349
01:17:13,741 --> 01:17:15,242
he would come.

1350
01:17:15,243 --> 01:17:17,877
He would come at once.

1351
01:17:22,252 --> 01:17:23,052
Allen would help him.

1352
01:17:23,053 --> 01:17:26,089
He was the only one
who  could "" help him.

1353
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:29,293
But what if Allen Campbell
should be out of England?

1354
01:17:29,294 --> 01:17:32,362
Days would pass
before he could come.

1355
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:36,700
Perhaps he would
refuse to come.

1356
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,842
Mr. Allen Campbell, sir.

1357
01:17:44,112 --> 01:17:46,813
This is kind
of you, Allen.

1358
01:17:51,789 --> 01:17:54,790
You said it was a matter
of life and death.

1359
01:17:55,694 --> 01:17:58,195
Listen to this.

1360
01:17:58,364 --> 01:18:01,299
"I sent my soul
through the invisible,

1361
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:04,302
"some letter of
that after-life to spell:

1362
01:18:04,372 --> 01:18:07,306
"and by and by
my soul returned to me,

1363
01:18:07,442 --> 01:18:10,744
and answered:
"" I myself  am heaven and hell."

1364
01:18:14,618 --> 01:18:17,120
That's quite good,
don't you think?

1365
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:20,256
I didn't come to discuss
the verses of Omar Khayyam.

1366
01:18:20,693 --> 01:18:22,660
Of course not.
Please sit down.

1367
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:25,496
I'll tell you
why I sent for you.

1368
01:18:27,134 --> 01:18:30,101
In a locked room
at the top of this house,

1369
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:33,339
a room to which no one
but myself has access,

1370
01:18:33,808 --> 01:18:36,676
a dead man is lying
across a table.

1371
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,347
He's been dead 10 hours.

1372
01:18:38,348 --> 01:18:40,149
Who he is, why he died,

1373
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,853
are matters that
do not concern you.

1374
01:18:42,854 --> 01:18:43,820
What you must do--

1375
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:46,257
there's no need
for you to go on.

1376
01:18:46,258 --> 01:18:49,192
Your horrible secrets
don't interest me.

1377
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:53,700
They'll have
to interest you.

1378
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:56,702
You are the one man
who is able to save me.

1379
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:59,941
I've seen your name
in scientific reviews

1380
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:02,244
in connection with
certain experiments.

1381
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:04,146
What has that
to do with you?

1382
01:19:04,147 --> 01:19:06,916
You have got to destroy
the thing upstairs--

1383
01:19:06,917 --> 01:19:09,885
destroy it so that
not a vestige is left.

1384
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:12,889
Nobody saw this person
come into the house.

1385
01:19:13,392 --> 01:19:14,326
When he is missed,

1386
01:19:14,327 --> 01:19:17,196
not a trace of him
must be found here.

1387
01:19:17,197 --> 01:19:19,900
Change him and everything
that belongs to him,

1388
01:19:19,901 --> 01:19:22,603
including his coat
and his traveling bag,

1389
01:19:22,604 --> 01:19:24,539
into a handful of ashes.

1390
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,907
You must be insane

1391
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:28,876
to suppose I'd lift
a finger to help you.

1392
01:19:29,446 --> 01:19:30,781
It was suicide.

1393
01:19:30,782 --> 01:19:32,315
What drove him
to it?

1394
01:19:32,316 --> 01:19:34,251
You won't
do this for me?

1395
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:36,921
How can you ask me,
of all men,

1396
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:39,756
to mix myself up
in this horror?

1397
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,497
Allen, it was murder.

1398
01:19:43,498 --> 01:19:44,598
I killed him.

1399
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:47,600
He was responsible
for the ruin of my life.

1400
01:19:48,403 --> 01:19:49,470
He didn't intend it,

1401
01:19:49,471 --> 01:19:51,440
but the result
was the same.

1402
01:19:51,441 --> 01:19:53,743
You are certain
to be caught.

1403
01:19:53,744 --> 01:19:55,077
No man
commits a crime

1404
01:19:55,078 --> 01:19:56,712
without doing
something stupid.

1405
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:58,782
I'll have
no part of it.

1406
01:19:58,783 --> 01:20:00,751
We were friends
once, Allen.

1407
01:20:00,752 --> 01:20:01,753
I regret that.

1408
01:20:01,754 --> 01:20:04,555
If you don't help me,
I am lost.

1409
01:20:04,724 --> 01:20:06,326
They will hang me.

1410
01:20:06,327 --> 01:20:06,726
Let them.

1411
01:20:07,461 --> 01:20:08,795
You refuse?

1412
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:09,063
Yes.

1413
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:10,930
I entreat you.

1414
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,366
It's useless.

1415
01:20:14,036 --> 01:20:15,137
I'm sorry, Allen.

1416
01:20:15,138 --> 01:20:17,305
You leave me
no alternative.

1417
01:20:17,306 --> 01:20:19,475
I've written a letter.

1418
01:20:19,476 --> 01:20:21,345
Here it is.

1419
01:20:21,346 --> 01:20:22,479
You see the address.

1420
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,381
If you don't help me,
I must send it.

1421
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:28,186
If you don't help me,

1422
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:29,421
I!!
Will send it.

1423
01:20:29,422 --> 01:20:32,256
You know what
the result will be.

1424
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:43,404
The thing is
quite simple, Allen.

1425
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,675
It would kill her.

1426
01:20:45,676 --> 01:20:47,578
I didn't think
you would want

1427
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:50,446
her name involved
in such a scandal.

1428
01:20:53,419 --> 01:20:55,254
I cannot do it.

1429
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:57,788
You have no choice.

1430
01:21:01,295 --> 01:21:03,464
I shall have to go home

1431
01:21:03,465 --> 01:21:06,400
and get some things
from the laboratory.

1432
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:13,409
You've saved
my life.

1433
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:27,094
Dorian dined that evening
with Lady Narborough,

1434
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:29,096
who had
what Lord Henry described

1435
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:32,299
as the remains of a really
remarkable ugliness.

1436
01:21:34,071 --> 01:21:36,373
You left early last night,
Dorian.

1437
01:21:36,374 --> 01:21:38,776
Did you go home
or to the club?

1438
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:40,478
Why are you
so inquisitive?

1439
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:41,779
I came in
at 12:30.

1440
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,882
If you want
corroborative evidence,

1441
01:21:43,883 --> 01:21:45,584
you can ask
my man.

1442
01:21:45,585 --> 01:21:47,553
Two hours unaccounted for,
Dorian.

1443
01:21:47,554 --> 01:21:49,622
I suspect
they'll bear investigation--

1444
01:21:49,623 --> 01:21:51,057
or perhaps they will not.

1445
01:21:51,058 --> 01:21:52,994
You've hardly
touched my dinner.

1446
01:21:52,995 --> 01:21:54,562
I believe
you're in love.

1447
01:21:54,563 --> 01:21:57,166
I haven't been in love
for a week,

1448
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:59,435
not since Madame de Ferrol
left town.

1449
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:00,270
She's a wonderful woman.

1450
01:22:00,271 --> 01:22:03,405
When her third husband died,
her hair turned gold.

1451
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:04,942
Husbands
of beautiful women

1452
01:22:04,943 --> 01:22:06,644

the criminal classes.

1453
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:08,579
The world says
you're wicked.

1454
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,915
What world says that?

1455
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:12,952
It can only be
the next  world.

1456
01:22:12,953 --> 01:22:14,989
Everyone I know
says he's wicked.

1457
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:17,425
It's monstrous
the way people go about

1458
01:22:17,426 --> 01:22:18,994
saying things
behind one's back

1459
01:22:18,995 --> 01:22:21,463
that are absolutely
and entirely true.

1460
01:22:21,464 --> 01:22:23,465
Women love us
for our defects.

1461
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:25,201
If we have
enough of them,

1462
01:22:25,202 --> 01:22:26,169
they forgive us
anything.

1463
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,105
No one will persuade me
that Mr. Gray is wicked.

1464
01:22:29,106 --> 01:22:32,242
I shall never forgive him
for remaining a bachelor.

1465
01:22:32,277 --> 01:22:35,180
Shouldn't we find him
a wife, Lord Henry?

1466
01:22:35,181 --> 01:22:36,982
I'm always
telling him so.

1467
01:22:36,983 --> 01:22:38,251
I shall go through debrett

1468
01:22:38,252 --> 01:22:41,286
and draw out a list
of eligible young ladies.

1469
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:43,024
With their ages?

1470
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:43,991
Only slightly edited.

1471
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,860
I want it to be
a suitable alliance.

1472
01:22:47,364 --> 01:22:49,999
I shall save you
the trouble of looking.

1473
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,934
I have chosen her,
if she will have me.

1474
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:54,638
I don't believe it.

1475
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,474
Gladys, darling,
will you marry me?

1476
01:23:05,787 --> 01:23:07,721
Of course I will,
darling.

1477
01:23:07,722 --> 01:23:10,359
[Henry]
this is the only marriage

1478
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,493
I've ever approved of.

1479
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:13,596
[Lady Narborough]
how terribly exciting!

1480
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:15,565
[Man]
I congratulate you both.

1481
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:18,100
[Indistinct chatter]

1482
01:23:22,909 --> 01:23:26,310
for months, the mysterious
disappearance of Basil Hallward

1483
01:23:26,413 --> 01:23:29,314
was the sensation
of London.

1484
01:23:30,184 --> 01:23:33,119
You don't mind if
I work while we talk?

1485
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:35,056
Not at all.

1486
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:36,057
It's an urgent matter.

1487
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,795
Tell me what you
discovered in France.

1488
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:39,862
Nothing at all.

1489
01:23:39,863 --> 01:23:41,298
We hunted up
everyone

1490
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:42,800

with my uncle.

1491
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:44,635
Not one
had seen him.

1492
01:23:44,636 --> 01:23:45,603
The Paris police

1493
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:47,906
don't believe
he arrived in France.

1494
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:48,807
Here at scotland yard,

1495
01:23:48,808 --> 01:23:51,377
we're equally convinced
he did leave London.

1496
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:53,246
The man
in the gray ulster

1497
01:23:53,247 --> 01:23:54,881
who boarded
at Victoria station

1498
01:23:54,882 --> 01:23:57,084
was undoubtedly
Basil Hallward.

1499
01:23:57,085 --> 01:23:59,421
What are we
to do now?

1500
01:23:59,422 --> 01:24:00,488
You're both young.

1501
01:24:00,489 --> 01:24:02,991
I understand you're
engaged to marry.

1502
01:24:02,992 --> 01:24:05,562
Go on with your own
lives peacefully.

1503
01:24:05,563 --> 01:24:07,431
Believe me,
that's the best course.

1504
01:24:07,432 --> 01:24:09,767
Scotland yard will not
forget Basil Hallward.

1505
01:24:09,768 --> 01:24:12,671
I thought Gladys
should go away for a while.

1506
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,641
I'm going to my country place
at Selby tomorrow.

1507
01:24:15,642 --> 01:24:18,544
Gladys will join me
with friends on thursday.

1508
01:24:18,545 --> 01:24:21,282
We'd be delighted
if you'd join us.

1509
01:24:21,283 --> 01:24:22,416
I can't get away,

1510
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:23,952
but I'm glad
you're going.

1511
01:24:23,953 --> 01:24:26,121
The diversion
will do you good.

1512
01:24:26,122 --> 01:24:27,489
Thank you,
Sir Robert.

1513
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:29,024
You've been
very kind.

1515

Mr. Gray,

1516
01:24:34,766 --> 01:24:35,700
are you acquainted

1517
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:38,003
with a young man
named Allen Campbell?

1518
01:24:38,004 --> 01:24:40,673
Yes. At one time,
we were great friends.

1519
01:24:40,674 --> 01:24:43,641
It's been a long time
since I've seen him.

1520
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,145
Why do you ask?

1521
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,147
I've just received
a tragic notice.

1522
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:49,484
This morning,
Allen Campbell died

1523
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:50,318
by his own hand.

1524
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:52,554
Why on earth should
Allen Campbell...

1525
01:24:52,555 --> 01:24:55,423
I thought you might
give me a clue.

1526
01:24:55,659 --> 01:24:57,327
He had everything
to live for.

1527
01:24:57,328 --> 01:25:00,430
He was achieving
a name for himself in science.

1528
01:25:00,565 --> 01:25:03,335
He left no note,
no letter, no explanation?

1529
01:25:03,336 --> 01:25:05,671
None. Whatever
drove him to it,

1530
01:25:05,672 --> 01:25:07,740
he took the secret
with him.

1531
01:25:07,741 --> 01:25:09,342
How little
we really know

inside a man.

01:25:13,849 --> 01:25:14,115
Yes.

You've been sad
all evening.

1535
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,729
Is it
Allen Campbell?

1536
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:25,096
Perhaps.

1537
01:25:25,731 --> 01:25:26,131
I'm sorry.

1538
01:25:32,839 --> 01:25:35,676
Let's be married soon--
in a fortnight.

1539
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:36,710

01:25:36,711 --> 01:25:38,813

our closest friends.

You call that soon?

Would Allen's blood
be on the painting now?

1547
01:26:13,891 --> 01:26:16,927
There were other roads
to forgetfulness

1548
01:26:16,929 --> 01:26:19,698
than the one
that Allen took.

1551
01:26:24,606 --> 01:26:24,972
Yes, sir.

One day,
we shall be awakened

with suffering and dismay

1554
01:26:32,415 --> 01:26:35,617
to the realization that the soul
is not a superstition

1555
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:39,488
nor the spirit of man
a material substance

1556
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:42,492

under a microscope.

if he gain the whole world

The soul is not an illusion.

1562
01:26:56,913 --> 01:26:59,448
It is a terrible reality.

01:26:59,449 --> 01:27:02,450

and bartered away.

01:29:38,818 --> 01:29:40,118
I look for him.

1588
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:42,756
Sir Tristan,
my sister called him,

1589
01:29:42,757 --> 01:29:45,158
because he was
like a knight.

1590
01:29:45,159 --> 01:29:48,027
If he was in Rangoon
or Valparaiso,

1591
01:29:48,564 --> 01:29:49,698
I'd find him,

1592
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:52,234
but in London
it's like looking

1593
01:29:52,235 --> 01:29:54,236
for a needle
in a haystack.

1594
01:29:54,237 --> 01:29:56,406
I don't know
his real name.

1595
01:29:56,407 --> 01:29:57,841
I don't even know

1596
01:29:57,842 --> 01:29:59,009
what he
looks like.

1597
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,912
When you find him,
what will you do?

1598
01:30:07,754 --> 01:30:09,790
Maybe he's dead
already.

1599
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:12,458
Did you think
of that?

1600
01:30:19,804 --> 01:30:22,438
I'll keep on
looking.

1601
01:30:25,577 --> 01:30:28,112
You're not English.

1602
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:30,649
What is "English"?

1603
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:33,485
There are men,
and there are women.

1604
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,662
This is Sir Tristan,
Kate, darling.

1605
01:30:40,663 --> 01:30:42,731
Don't call me
that, Adrian.

1606
01:30:42,732 --> 01:30:45,667
I heard Lord Henry
call you Sir Tristan.

1607
01:30:45,703 --> 01:30:48,405
At the time,
I thought it fit.

1608
01:30:48,406 --> 01:30:50,040
Why don't we
see you?

1609
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,643
I have all I need here--

1610
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:56,448
drink and drugs
and no friends.

1611
01:30:58,819 --> 01:31:01,188
I had too many friends.

1612
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,257
[Kate]
oh, he's drawing a picture of you, sir.

1613
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:07,363
Come and look at it.

1614
01:31:07,364 --> 01:31:09,366
What would you like--

1615
01:31:09,367 --> 01:31:11,967
a song, poem, painting?

1616
01:31:14,673 --> 01:31:17,474
I do all three
surpassingly well.

1617
01:31:19,913 --> 01:31:21,681
It seems to me

1618
01:31:21,682 --> 01:31:24,316
there's something lacking.

1619
01:31:31,093 --> 01:31:31,461
I have it.

1620
01:31:34,965 --> 01:31:37,500
But grim to see...

1621
01:31:42,474 --> 01:31:44,877
Is a gallows tree.

1622
01:31:44,878 --> 01:31:47,412
Good-bye, Adrian.

1623
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:51,919
And green or dry,
a man must die

1624
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,955
before it bears
its fruit.

1625
01:31:53,956 --> 01:31:56,623
Good-bye,
Sir Tristan.

1626
01:32:03,835 --> 01:32:06,436
What did you call him?

1627
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:08,474
Sit down.

1628
01:32:09,342 --> 01:32:11,177
I'll draw
your picture

1629
01:32:11,178 --> 01:32:13,580
for the price
of three drinks...

1630
01:32:13,581 --> 01:32:14,814
Four drinks.

1631
01:32:14,815 --> 01:32:16,517
Sir Tristan,
you said.

1632
01:32:16,518 --> 01:32:19,486
And Sir Tristan rode forth
into the forest,

1633
01:32:20,423 --> 01:32:21,991
seeking his only love.

1634
01:32:21,992 --> 01:32:24,826
He has gone
to kill your friend.

1635
01:32:27,231 --> 01:32:29,999
Justice has
come to England...

1636
01:32:31,471 --> 01:32:34,004
Without wig or gown.

1637
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,507
Come on, Kate.

1638
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:40,514
If it's money
you want--

1639
01:32:40,515 --> 01:32:41,716
I'm Sibyl Vane's brother.

1640
01:32:41,717 --> 01:32:44,119
Does that mean
anything to you?

1641
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:44,752
No, nothing.

1642
01:32:44,753 --> 01:32:46,855
Why are you called
Sir Tristan?

1643
01:32:46,856 --> 01:32:48,390
It happens to be
my name.

1644
01:32:48,391 --> 01:32:51,526
You're lying. 18 Years,
I've been looking for you.

1645
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:54,463
How old do you
think I am?

1646
01:33:14,224 --> 01:33:15,892
Why didn't you
murder him?

1647
01:33:15,893 --> 01:33:18,662
They could only
have hanged you for it.

1648
01:33:18,663 --> 01:33:21,366
He's not the man
I'm looking for.

1649
01:33:21,367 --> 01:33:22,433
He's too young.

1650
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:25,104
How old
do you think he is?

1651
01:33:25,105 --> 01:33:26,438
22, I'd say.

1652
01:33:26,439 --> 01:33:26,807
Ha ha ha!

1653
01:33:27,307 --> 01:33:29,409
What are you
laughing at?

1654
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:32,478
Dorian Gray has looked 22
for the last 20 years.

1655
01:33:35,918 --> 01:33:38,686
What did you say
his name was?

1656
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:14,733
In your case,

1657
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:16,936
this strange impulse
to be good

1658
01:34:16,937 --> 01:34:18,071
is merely the effect

1659
01:34:18,072 --> 01:34:19,707
of your approaching
marriage.

1660
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:20,807
It'll wear off.

1661
01:34:20,808 --> 01:34:22,643
Would you pull
that blind?

1662
01:34:22,644 --> 01:34:25,447
The truth is,
I want to be better.

1663
01:34:25,448 --> 01:34:28,284
At least it will be
a novel sensation.

1664
01:34:28,285 --> 01:34:29,785
It needn't
become a habit.

1665
01:34:29,786 --> 01:34:32,456
Marriage
is a habit-- a bad habit.

1666
01:34:32,457 --> 01:34:34,324
I trust
it won't make you

1667
01:34:34,325 --> 01:34:35,927
a hopelessly
reformed character.

1668
01:34:35,928 --> 01:34:37,963
What are people
talking about in London?

1669
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:40,633
They were talking about
Basil's disappearance.

1670
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:41,768
Now they're taken up

1671
01:34:41,769 --> 01:34:43,136
with Allen Campbell's
suicide.

1672
01:34:43,137 --> 01:34:45,372
What do you think
happened to Basil?

1673
01:34:45,373 --> 01:34:47,174
I suppose
we shall be told

1674
01:34:47,175 --> 01:34:49,878
that he's been seen
in San Francisco.

1675
01:34:49,879 --> 01:34:51,112
Everyone who disappears

1676
01:34:51,113 --> 01:34:53,883
is said to be seen
in San Francisco.

1677
01:34:53,884 --> 01:34:55,851
It must be
a delightful city.

1678
01:34:55,852 --> 01:34:58,589
He was a fine painter,
I'm certain.

1679
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,158
The best thing
Basil did

1680
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,427
was that wonderful
portrait of you.

1681
01:35:02,428 --> 01:35:03,561
What is your secret?

1682
01:35:03,562 --> 01:35:06,497
You don't look a day
older than you did

1683
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,367
when that portrait
was painted.

1684
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:09,903
Perhaps I'll
tell you someday.

1685
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:12,573
To get back my youth,
I'd do anything

1686
01:35:12,574 --> 01:35:14,509
except get up early,
exercise,

1687
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,510
or be respectable.

1688
01:35:15,511 --> 01:35:17,713
I sometimes think
I'd give anything

1689
01:35:17,714 --> 01:35:20,515
if I could change
and grow old.

1690
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,882
My good resolutions
may have come too late.

1691
01:35:50,356 --> 01:35:52,557
Though Dorian placed guards
about the estate,

1692
01:35:52,558 --> 01:35:55,860
the consciousness of being
hunted, snared, tracked down

1693
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:58,064
began to dominate him.

1694
01:35:58,065 --> 01:36:00,433
In the small hours
of the night,

1695
01:36:00,434 --> 01:36:02,603
when every sound
is seized upon

1696
01:36:02,604 --> 01:36:04,873
by the distraught
imagination,

1697
01:36:04,874 --> 01:36:07,744
remorse and terror
laid hold of him.

1698
01:36:07,745 --> 01:36:09,011
Each detail of his crimes

1699
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:12,214
came back to him in nightmares
with added horror,

1700
01:36:12,717 --> 01:36:14,118
haunting him relentlessly

1701
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:17,087
with the living death
of his soul.

1702
01:36:20,126 --> 01:36:20,494
[Gunfire]

1703
01:36:20,694 --> 01:36:23,695
with the day
came the cruel necessity

1704
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:26,899
to dissemble to Gladys
and to his guests.

1705
01:36:27,603 --> 01:36:28,003
[Gunfire]

1706
01:36:32,509 --> 01:36:34,611
have you had
good sport?

1707
01:36:34,612 --> 01:36:35,412
Not very good.

1708
01:36:35,413 --> 01:36:37,782
The birds have gone
to the open.

1709
01:36:37,783 --> 01:36:40,550
It may be better
after lunch.

1710
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:47,693
Don't shoot it,
geoffrey.

1711
01:36:47,694 --> 01:36:48,062
Nonsense!

1712
01:36:49,196 --> 01:36:49,564
[Gunshot]

1713
01:36:50,365 --> 01:36:51,465
[man screams]

1714
01:36:51,466 --> 01:36:52,633
I've hit a beater!

1715
01:36:52,634 --> 01:36:55,270
The idiot
got in front of the gun.

1716
01:36:55,271 --> 01:36:57,506
Stop shooting!
A man's hurt!

1717
01:36:57,507 --> 01:36:58,341
Sir, where is he?

1718
01:36:58,342 --> 01:37:01,443
Here. Why on earth don't you
keep your men back?

1719
01:37:02,012 --> 01:37:04,847
Spoiled my shooting
for the day.

1720
01:37:15,463 --> 01:37:16,397
I've told them

1721
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:18,032
the shooting's
stopped for today.

1722
01:37:18,033 --> 01:37:20,469
It wouldn't
look well to go on.

1723
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,002
Is the man--

1724
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:24,038
he's dead. He received
the charge in his chest.

1725
01:37:27,345 --> 01:37:28,211
Thornton. Come in.

1726
01:37:28,212 --> 01:37:30,582
I suppose you've come
about the accident.

1727
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:32,851
Was he married?
Did he have dependents?

1728
01:37:32,852 --> 01:37:35,887
I'll write them any sum
you think necessary.

1729
01:37:36,022 --> 01:37:37,223
We don't know him.

1730
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:39,192
That's why
I came to you.

1731
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:40,895
Wasn't he
one of your men?

1732
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:43,864
Never saw him before.
Seems like a sailor.

1733
01:37:44,367 --> 01:37:44,733
A sailor?

1734
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:47,869
Looks as if he'd been
a sort of sailor--

1735
01:37:48,338 --> 01:37:49,238
tattooed on both arms.

1736
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:52,408
Wasn't anything found on him
that would tell his names?

1737
01:37:52,744 --> 01:37:55,446
Money--not much--
and a six-shooter.

1738
01:37:55,447 --> 01:37:56,815
No name of any kind.

1739
01:37:56,816 --> 01:37:58,984
Decent-looking man,
but rough-like.

1740
01:37:58,985 --> 01:38:00,820
Sort of sailor,
we think.

1741
01:38:00,821 --> 01:38:02,021
Where is the body?

1742
01:38:02,022 --> 01:38:04,890
In an empty stable
at the home farm.

1743
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:16,771
Show me his face.

1744
01:38:39,937 --> 01:38:41,571
[Knock on door]

1745
01:38:41,572 --> 01:38:41,906
come in.

1746
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,475
What is it, Dorian?

1747
01:38:44,476 --> 01:38:46,511
Oh, but you
haven't changed.

1748
01:38:46,512 --> 01:38:49,247
You'll be late
for dinner.

1749
01:38:50,283 --> 01:38:52,917
I wanted to look at you.

1750
01:38:54,789 --> 01:38:55,822
I know, darling.

1751
01:38:55,823 --> 01:38:58,759
I've felt that way
so often about you.

1752
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:11,042
Good-bye, Gladys.

1753
01:39:11,043 --> 01:39:11,443
Good-bye?

1754
01:39:12,645 --> 01:39:15,047
Until
half past 8:00.

1755
01:39:15,048 --> 01:39:17,616
Until half past 8:00.

1756
01:39:37,844 --> 01:39:38,144
Go on.

1757
01:39:41,715 --> 01:39:44,018
Shall I go on,
sir?

1758
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:44,319
Yes.

1759
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:49,924
[Knock on door]

1760
01:39:49,925 --> 01:39:51,360
[Gladys]
Dorian!

1761
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:51,694
Dorian!

1762
01:40:08,616 --> 01:40:10,885
David, what brings you
to Selby?

1763
01:40:10,886 --> 01:40:12,554
Have you seen Dorian?

1764
01:40:12,555 --> 01:40:14,255
What is it?
What's happened?

1765
01:40:14,256 --> 01:40:15,858
Dorian's
gone to London.

1766
01:40:15,859 --> 01:40:16,958
Didn't you know?

1767
01:40:16,959 --> 01:40:18,061
David passed him

1768
01:40:18,062 --> 01:40:20,063
on his way
from the station.

1769
01:40:20,064 --> 01:40:21,398
He looked
black as thunder.

1770
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:24,433
I thought he'd found out
what I'd been up to.

1771
01:40:24,903 --> 01:40:26,805
What have you
been up to?

1772
01:40:26,806 --> 01:40:28,507
You'll put it down
to jealousy.

1773
01:40:28,508 --> 01:40:31,378
I don't deny jealousy's
mixed up in it.

1774
01:40:31,379 --> 01:40:32,979
I had a dreadful
presentiment.

1775
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,715
When you announced
the marriage,

1776
01:40:34,716 --> 01:40:37,218
I grew desperate
to stop it.

1777
01:40:37,219 --> 01:40:39,153
What is it you've done,
David?

1778
01:40:39,154 --> 01:40:41,323
There's a locked room
in Dorian's house.

1779
01:40:41,324 --> 01:40:44,459
I didn't attach
any importance to it at first.

1780
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:46,796
He could have
locked up anything.

1781
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:48,332
Then one
of Dorian's valets

1782
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:50,267
came to see me
about a position.

1783
01:40:50,268 --> 01:40:53,437
It struck me
how often Dorian changed his servants.

1784
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:56,209
This one told me
Dorian locked himself

1785
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:58,212
in that room
at all hours.

1786
01:40:58,213 --> 01:41:00,313
One night,
he heard a noise

1787
01:41:00,314 --> 01:41:01,449
and went to investigate.

1788
01:41:01,450 --> 01:41:03,818
Dorian came out
and looked at him

1789
01:41:03,819 --> 01:41:06,321
as if he could kill him,
he said.

1790
01:41:06,322 --> 01:41:09,024
He accused him of spying
and sacked him.

1791
01:41:09,025 --> 01:41:11,960
I felt if I could
get into that room,

1792
01:41:11,963 --> 01:41:14,964
I might find something
to stop this marriage.

1793
01:41:15,134 --> 01:41:17,668
And did you get in?

1794
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:24,578
I bribed
one of the servants

1795
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:27,480
to get me an impression
of the lock.

1796
01:41:27,849 --> 01:41:28,750
Here's the key.

1797
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:31,819
I waited until Dorian
came down here to Selby

1798
01:41:32,189 --> 01:41:33,422
and then let myself in.

1799
01:41:33,423 --> 01:41:36,492
I know you'll despise me
for stooping to this,

1800
01:41:36,527 --> 01:41:39,495
but it doesn't matter
what you think of me

1801
01:41:39,765 --> 01:41:42,534
if I can stop you
from marrying him.

1802
01:41:42,535 --> 01:41:45,336
What did you find
in the room?

1803
01:41:45,673 --> 01:41:46,506
Nothing, really.

1804
01:41:46,507 --> 01:41:48,508
It's an old schoolroom
with books

1805
01:41:48,509 --> 01:41:50,711
and a portrait with
a covering.

1806
01:41:50,712 --> 01:41:52,513
Portrait? Of whom?

1807
01:41:52,514 --> 01:41:53,448
I don't know.

1808
01:41:53,449 --> 01:41:56,185
The original must be
a monstrous person,

1809
01:41:56,186 --> 01:41:57,119
if an original exists.

1810
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,422
Has a vague family
resemblance to Dorian--

1811
01:41:59,423 --> 01:42:01,891
a sort of middle-aged,
mad, gruesome uncle

1812
01:42:01,892 --> 01:42:04,928
with a debauched face
and blood all over it.

1813
01:42:05,364 --> 01:42:06,597
Your uncle painted it.

1814
01:42:06,598 --> 01:42:09,533
My uncle never painted
such a picture.

1815
01:42:10,437 --> 01:42:12,405
He signed it.

1816
01:42:12,406 --> 01:42:14,374
I'd been counting
so much

1817
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,043
on finding
something to help me

1818
01:42:16,044 --> 01:42:19,213
that I decided I'd
been doing Dorian an injustice.

1819
01:42:19,549 --> 01:42:21,717
I had an impulse
to come here

1820
01:42:21,718 --> 01:42:24,254
and make a clean
breast of it,

1821
01:42:24,255 --> 01:42:25,421
give you my blessing

1822
01:42:25,422 --> 01:42:26,556
and ask
your forgiveness.

1823
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:29,260
Describe the portrait
in greater detail.

1824
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:30,261
There's a curious cat,

1825
01:42:30,262 --> 01:42:33,163
like the one in
Dorian's drawing room,

1826
01:42:33,533 --> 01:42:36,367
only in the portrait
the eyes shine

1827
01:42:36,603 --> 01:42:39,504
in an evil way
that's indescribable.

1828
01:42:44,748 --> 01:42:46,948
Did you notice
anything unusual

1829
01:42:46,949 --> 01:42:48,351
about the signature?

1830
01:42:48,352 --> 01:42:51,019
No,
I don't think so.

1831
01:42:52,523 --> 01:42:54,458
Now that I see you,
Gladys,

1832
01:42:54,459 --> 01:42:56,795
I can't say
what I intended to.

1833
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:58,930
I know that this
marriage is wrong.

1834
01:42:58,931 --> 01:43:02,000
There's something
strange and evil in Dorian.

1835
01:43:02,035 --> 01:43:03,469
Was there a letter "g"

1836
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:06,440
under the signature
on that painting, David,

1837
01:43:06,441 --> 01:43:06,808
like this?

1838
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:11,478
I believe there was.
How did you know?

1839
01:43:11,648 --> 01:43:14,148
[Knock on door]

1840
01:43:17,054 --> 01:43:17,988
yes, gibson?

1841
01:43:17,989 --> 01:43:20,990
Mr. Gray asked me
to bring you this letter

1842
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,361
when I got back
from the station.

1843
01:43:23,362 --> 01:43:26,331
He said I must give it
to you in person.

1844
01:43:40,418 --> 01:43:42,386
[Dorian's voice]
once I said

1845
01:43:42,387 --> 01:43:44,021
that if I were to marry you,

1846
01:43:44,022 --> 01:43:46,090
it would be
an incredible wickedness.

1847
01:43:46,091 --> 01:43:49,059
You thought
it was a way of saying

1848
01:43:49,195 --> 01:43:50,696
I didn't love you.

1849
01:43:50,697 --> 01:43:51,530
I do love you,

1850
01:43:51,531 --> 01:43:53,266
more than anything
in the world,

1851
01:43:53,267 --> 01:43:56,502
but I only bring disaster
on those who love me.

1852
01:43:56,738 --> 01:43:59,540
If you knew how I've
already wronged you,

1853
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,944
you would turn from me
in horror.

1854
01:44:01,945 --> 01:44:03,880
You will never
see me again.

1855
01:44:03,881 --> 01:44:06,815
Try to remember me,
dear Gladys,

1856
01:44:06,817 --> 01:44:07,685
without bitterness.

1857
01:44:07,686 --> 01:44:10,854
This is the only good thing
I have ever done.

1858
01:44:13,693 --> 01:44:16,162
Won't you tell us
what it is?

1859
01:44:16,163 --> 01:44:18,830
Perhaps
we can help you.

1860
01:44:20,568 --> 01:44:23,303
We must go
to London at once.

1861
01:44:31,782 --> 01:44:35,019
[Narrator]
was it true that one  could never change?

1862
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:38,222
He longed for the unstained
purity of his youth,

1863
01:44:38,625 --> 01:44:39,425
before he had prayed

1864
01:44:39,426 --> 01:44:42,161
in a monstrous moment
of pride and passion

1865
01:44:42,162 --> 01:44:44,398
that the painting
should bear the burden

1866
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:47,366
of the years
and of his corruption.

1867
01:44:48,504 --> 01:44:50,104
Sibyl Vane was dead,

1868
01:44:50,105 --> 01:44:51,306
and now her brother

1869
01:44:51,307 --> 01:44:53,843
would be hidden
in a nameless grave.

1870
01:44:53,844 --> 01:44:56,413
Allen Campbell
had shot himself,

1871
01:44:56,414 --> 01:44:58,881
and Basil...

1872
01:45:02,821 --> 01:45:05,556
Nothing could alter that.

1873
01:45:06,293 --> 01:45:09,361
It was of the future
that he must think.

1874
01:45:10,298 --> 01:45:11,699
He had spared Gladys.

1875
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,868
Would there be any sign
of his one good deed

1876
01:45:15,872 --> 01:45:18,440
in the portrait?

1877
01:45:39,902 --> 01:45:42,904
It was there--
almost imperceptible,

1878
01:45:42,906 --> 01:45:45,642
but surely it was there
in the eyes,

1879
01:45:45,643 --> 01:45:48,911
struggling through the horror
and the loathsomeness.

1880
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:52,249
There was hope
for him, then.

1881
01:45:53,252 --> 01:45:56,255
He would go away,
leave England forever,

1882
01:45:56,256 --> 01:45:58,091
live obscurely
in a distant country,

1883
01:45:58,092 --> 01:46:01,327
find peace in a life
of humility and self-denial.

1884
01:46:01,696 --> 01:46:04,664
He would expel
every sign of evil

1885
01:46:04,834 --> 01:46:05,700
from the painted face.

1886
01:46:05,701 --> 01:46:08,838
He would watch the hideousness
fade and change.

1887
01:46:08,839 --> 01:46:11,873
But the painting
would always be there

1888
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:14,112
to tempt his weakness.

1889
01:46:14,113 --> 01:46:15,246
Better to destroy it,

1890
01:46:15,247 --> 01:46:18,382
to grow old inevitably
as all men grow old.

1891
01:46:18,518 --> 01:46:20,320
If he fell
into evil ways,

1892
01:46:20,321 --> 01:46:23,323
to be punished
as all men are punished.

1893
01:46:23,324 --> 01:46:26,093
Better if each sin
of his life

1894
01:46:26,094 --> 01:46:28,496
were to breed
sure, swift penalty.

1895
01:46:28,497 --> 01:46:31,199
The knife that had killed
Basil Hallward

1896
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,269
would kill
his portrait also

1897
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:34,871
and free him at a stroke

1898
01:46:34,872 --> 01:46:37,906
from the evil enchantment
of the past.

1899
01:46:57,634 --> 01:47:00,936
But when the knife pierced
the heart of the portrait,

1900
01:47:02,574 --> 01:47:05,508
an extraordinary thing
happened.

1901
01:47:38,318 --> 01:47:40,387
[Dorian]
father, forgive me,

1902
01:47:40,388 --> 01:47:41,656
for I have sinned.

1903
01:47:41,657 --> 01:47:43,791
Father, forgive me,
for I have sinned.

1904
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:46,894
Through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

1905
01:48:05,487 --> 01:48:08,021
[Doorknob rattling]

1906
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:37,692
heaven forgive me.

1907
01:48:49,009 --> 01:48:51,676
Take Gladys home,
David.
