00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:09,620
Now, I only have one weak link
I got to worry about.

662
00:56:09,694 --> 00:56:12,888
- What ?
- You.

663
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:17,256
Yousee, you're how we foundout
where the victim 'sbody was.

664
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:20,622
And how you found out,
well,

665
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:23,887
that might open up
a real can ofworms for us.

666
00:56:23,959 --> 00:56:28,482
Psychic phenomena,
E.S.P., dreams, visions.

667
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,821
The defense

Iunderstandthere wasbadbIood...

ToIdhis wife

673
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:50,489
Donnie's quite
a ladies' man.

674
00:56:50,557 --> 00:56:52,784

675

677
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:02,121
But at the trial
there can't be any surprises.

678
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:06,448
So, is there anything I need
to know about you or Donnie...

679
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:09,750
orDonnie's wife
orthe victim ?

680
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:12,287
No.

681
00:57:12,355 --> 00:57:14,650
Will that be all ?

685
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:30,279

701
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:22,974
- Yes, sir.
- Your Honor, let the record show...

702
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:27,070
that I'vejust shown Mr. Hawkins
a photograph ofJessica King.

703
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:34,705
You just said that your attention
was drawn to the defendant's pond.

704
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,068
Drawn in--
Well, drawn in what way ?

705
00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:43,240
Me, Wayne Collins
and Kenneth King...

706
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,242
went to see a woman,
name ofAnnie Wilson.

707
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,742
What made you think this woman
would be able to help you ?

708
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:53,572
Well, word around town
was that she was a,

709

when she looked into
her little crystal ball ?

713
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:12,515
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these, uh, special cards.

714
00:59:12,585 --> 00:59:15,846
What did she see when she looked
into her little special cards ?

715
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:18,180
Uh, she didn't actually
see nothing then.

Well, he was

735
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:26,607

Buddy, I got a lot on my mind.
It's not a good time, okay ?

739
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,974
Um, Mrs. Wilson ?

Can you tell me why

744
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,031
All right, well--

- I need to talk to you.
- Buddy.

747
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:05,205
I've been thinking about my daddy
and I've been touching myself.

748
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:08,204
- Touching yourself? How ?
- Why do I do that ?

749
01:01:08,272 --> 01:01:09,828
It's not a good time.

750
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:13,167
- Something's bad wrong with me.
- Look, Buddy--

751
01:01:13,238 --> 01:01:16,203

826
01:06:11,556 --> 01:06:14,749
orthey were happening
somepIace eIse.

827
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:19,981
My granny told me that I--
I had a gift that runs in my family.

828
01:06:20,054 --> 01:06:22,350
And she told me that
I shouldn't be afraid of it.

829
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:27,512
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd-- I'd be all right.

830
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:29,576
So, you'reswearing
before this court...

831
01:06:29,654 --> 01:06:31,812
that you didn't get your information
about this tragedy...

832
01:06:31,886 --> 01:06:34,750
from any other means
than your special ability ?

833
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,809
- Your gift.
- Yes, sir.

834
01:06:37,886 --> 01:06:40,612
I'm swearing that. Yes.

835
01:06:40,685 --> 01:06:43,674
- Thankyou, Mrs. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.

836
01:06:43,752 --> 01:06:46,445
- I have no further questions.
- [Judge]Mr. Weems.

837
01:06:51,352 --> 01:06:52,840
[Weems]
Mrs. WiIson.

838
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,273
How many fiingers am I holding up
behind my back ?

839
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,316
- Objection, Your Honor.
- YourHonor,

840
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:04,110
my client is sitting in this
courtroom on trial for his life...

841
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:07,671
partIybecause ofpowers
that this woman cIaims to have.

842
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:10,681
Now, in all fairness, I believe
I should be given the opportunity...

843
01:07:10,749 --> 01:07:12,681
to test
the alleged powers...

844
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:15,271
instead of having to stand here
and take her word for it.

845
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:18,803
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.

846
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:24,245
Can everyone in thejury box
see how many fiingers I'm showing ?

847
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,908
How many fiingers,
Mrs. Wilson ?

848
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:38,511
I don't know.

849
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:40,772
You don't know ?

850
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:46,800
Seven.
Seven fingers.

851
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:49,503
That-- That doesn't
prove anything.

852
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:52,702
Your Honor, I can't do this,
you know, at the drop ofa hat.

853
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:57,141
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing
it at the drop ofa dollar bill ?

854
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,472
What are you trying to say ?

855
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,941
I'm trying to say maybe this special
gift ofyours doesn't work...

856
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,737
unless you're
being paid for it.

857
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,241
Like they say in the army,
''No money, no honey.''

858
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:09,275
No, that's not true.

859
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,275
Are you aware that in Hatcher County
it's against the law...

860
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:13,501
for a psychic to set up shop
and charge people money ?

861
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:15,564
Well, I don't charge money.

862
01:08:15,642 --> 01:08:17,608
You just testifiied
that you do charge money.

863
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:21,072
No. I accept donations.
People give me gifts.

864
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:25,799
Oh. A distinction
worthy ofa lawyer.

865
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:28,362
Mrs. Wilson,
you a rich woman ?

866
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,463
- No.
- Why not ?

867
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:35,438
If I had psychic powers and could
read the future, I'd be fiilthy rich.

868
01:08:35,506 --> 01:08:37,438
I'dbepIaying
theStockMarket.

869
01:08:37,505 --> 01:08:40,471
I'dbe overin MobiIe
betting on the dogs.

870
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:42,801
I'd certainly warn my husband
not to go to work...

871
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:45,303
on the day I know the Reinhold
Plant's gonna blow up...

872
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:49,599
leaving three little ol' children
to be raised in a carnival sideshow.

873
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,966
Well, it doesn't work
that way, sir.

874
01:08:53,037 --> 01:08:55,003
I can't use my gift
for personal gain.

875
01:08:55,071 --> 01:09:00,298
Except for those, uh,
what you call 'em, donations ?

876
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,559
You've had some personal trouble
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you ?

877
01:09:13,802 --> 01:09:15,734
Yes, I have.

878
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:18,632
Just a few weeks ago, you told him--
I believe the exact words was...

879
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:20,963
you was gonna have
his ass thrown in jail.

880
01:09:21,034 --> 01:09:23,795
- But he was threatening my kids.
- Ain't it also true...

881
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:26,799
that a few weeks ago in one of
those famous readings ofyours,

882
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:28,798
when you were doing
your so-called E.S.P.,

883
01:09:28,866 --> 01:09:31,162
you told Valerie Barksdale,
Donnie's wife,

884
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,596
that Donnie wasjust
an insecure redneck...

885
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,598
and that he wasn't really
crazy enough to kill anybody ?

886
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:45,297
Yes, I did say that.

887
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:47,592
Then why today are you
saying he did kill somebody ?

888
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:49,596
Wait a second.
I've never said that.

889
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:52,186
You might as well have, ma'am.
You wanted his ass in jail.

890
01:09:52,264 --> 01:09:55,628
-He's on trial for his life.
-I just told the sheriffwhat I saw.

891
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:59,255
And how could any of us
ever forget that ?

892
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:03,128
Jessica Kingjust
floatin' up in that tree,

893
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:05,718
naked,

894
01:10:05,796 --> 01:10:08,284
with a chain...

895
01:10:08,362 --> 01:10:10,294
wrappedaroundher.

896
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:15,721
It must be
so much fun foryou.

897
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,954
You must be having
the time ofyour life...

898
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:21,118
entertaining yourself
with your dreams and your visions.

899
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:24,751
You think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir ?

900
01:10:24,827 --> 01:10:26,759
You think that's fun ?

901
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:30,224
Do you think it's fun I have people
trying to strangle me in my sleep ?

902
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:32,452
NowI'm sittinghere
andI'm bIaming myseIf...

903
01:10:32,526 --> 01:10:34,958
'cause some poor crazy man tried
to burn his daddy halfto death.

904
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:36,958
And you think I'm sitting here
having fun ?

905
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,820
I'm sorry, sir.
You're crazy ifyou think that.

906
01:10:39,892 --> 01:10:42,653
No more questions,
Your Honor.

907
01:10:44,192 --> 01:10:46,123
[Judge]
You're dismissed.

908
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:01,747
Like theysay in HoIIywood,
Iet'sjust cut to the chase.

909
01:11:01,823 --> 01:11:05,050
Did you or did you not
kill Jessica King ?

910
01:11:05,122 --> 01:11:07,054
I did not.

911
01:11:07,122 --> 01:11:10,747
Did you or did you not seeJessica
King on the night she was killed ?

912
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:14,083
Yeah, I seen her.

913
01:11:14,155 --> 01:11:16,620
Would you describe
the circumstances, please ?

914
01:11:16,688 --> 01:11:19,483
Well, I'd been seeing her
for quite a while.

915
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:22,951
WouIdyou cIarify what
you mean by ''seeing'' ?

916
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:26,474
I mean, her and me
had been having sex.

917
01:11:26,553 --> 01:11:30,212
Okay, go ahead.

918
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,548
WeII, she caIIedme
about 1 1.:00.

919
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:36,483
So I told her
I'd meet her out at AyJay's.

920
01:11:36,552 --> 01:11:39,109
And I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.

921
01:11:39,185 --> 01:11:42,549
- What happened after that ?
- Well, we got in an argument.

922
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:44,550
She told me she didn't
want to see me no more.

923
01:11:44,618 --> 01:11:47,311
-Did she tell you why ?
-She said she was getting married...

924
01:11:47,384 --> 01:11:49,975
in a couple of months and she
wanted to stop playing around.

925
01:11:50,051 --> 01:11:53,211
At Ieast
tiIIafterthe wedding.

926
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:55,216
Andduring the course
ofthisargument with Miss King,

927
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:57,306
did you at any moment
strike her ?

928
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,414
Yes, sir.

929
01:12:06,349 --> 01:12:08,645
What happened
afteryou struck her ?

930
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:11,375
WeII, she bangedherhead
prettyhard when she went down,

931
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:14,676
so I-- Idecided
to take herto the hospitaI.

932
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:17,804
- Did you reach the hospital ?
- No, sir.

933
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:19,813
Are you feeling okay ?

934
01:12:21,747 --> 01:12:23,679
I'm fiine.

935
01:12:25,113 --> 01:12:27,102
I wanna go back.

936
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,702
I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone--

937
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,712
Someone might see me.

938
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,871
Shesaidshe wasfeeIingbetter,
so Itookherback toAyJay's.

939
01:12:35,946 --> 01:12:40,275
Idroppedheroff,
then I went on backhome.

940
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:44,800
Andthat was the veryIast time
thatyousawJessica KingaIive ?

941
01:12:44,878 --> 01:12:47,867
- Yes, sir. The very last.
- Donnie,

942
01:12:47,945 --> 01:12:51,240
are you guilty
ofthe charge against you ?

943
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:55,188
I'm guilty
ofcheating on my wife,

944
01:12:55,322 --> 01:12:57,753
ofbeinga badhusband,

945
01:12:57,821 --> 01:13:00,343
a badChristian.

946
01:13:00,421 --> 01:13:02,852
But I ain't guilty
of killingJesse.

947
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,385
I swear to God.

948
01:13:05,453 --> 01:13:08,749
No more questions,
Your Honor.

949
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,183
Mr. Duncan.

950
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:14,776
Mr. Barksdale,
you're a wife-beater, aren't you ?

951
01:13:18,586 --> 01:13:21,517
I've swore to tell
the truth here today.

952
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:25,881
Yeah, I've hit
VaIerie before.

953
01:13:25,952 --> 01:13:28,349
I guess
it ain't no secret.

954
01:13:28,418 --> 01:13:31,577
So, you admit to havinga history
ofvioIence against women ?

955
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,513
You also admit to having
beaten up the victim...

956
01:13:33,584 --> 01:13:35,174
on the night
that she was murdered.

957
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,182
I wouldn't exactly say
that I beat her up.

958
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,613
You're the expert. You teIIme.
Just howbadIy doyou...

959
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:43,945
have to beat a woman before it fiits
your defiinition of ''beating up'' ?

960
01:13:44,015 --> 01:13:47,742
Now, yourstoryis thatyou've
been havingan affair...

961
01:13:47,815 --> 01:13:50,679
with the victim.

962
01:13:50,749 --> 01:13:54,112
But tell us why a beautiful
young woman likeJessica King...

963
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,113
from one ofthe fiinest
families in Brixton,

964
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:59,305
just about to be married to a good,
decent professional man...

965
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,107
and with a bright,
shining future in front ofher--

966
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:05,374
Why would a woman like that get
involved with something like you ?

967
01:14:05,447 --> 01:14:09,674
I asked her that
myselfone time.

968
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:12,940
She said I was the only man
in town who knew how to fuck.

969
01:14:13,012 --> 01:14:15,240
[Murmuring]

970
01:14:15,313 --> 01:14:18,006
You're really disgusting.
You know that ?

971
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:21,340
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection sustained.

972
01:14:21,412 --> 01:14:24,502
Mr. Duncan, you will refrain from
making those personal comments.

973
01:14:24,578 --> 01:14:27,510
I apologize, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

974
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:32,867
So, let's get this straight.
Let's clarify this.

975
01:14:32,944 --> 01:14:35,375
You're saying it was
just a coincidence...

976
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:39,034
that on the very same night that you
physically assaulted Jessica King,

977
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:41,235
someone else put
her body in your pond ?

978
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,605
I'm not saying
it was a coincidence.

979
01:14:43,676 --> 01:14:46,267
- What are you saying ?
- I'm saying I got framed !

980
01:14:46,342 --> 01:14:48,535
Oh, well, what an original defense.

981
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:51,006
Did you think ofJessica King
as a stray cat ?

982
01:14:51,075 --> 01:14:52,597
No.

983
01:14:52,675 --> 01:14:54,937
Did you tell SheriffJohnson that
a stray cat had clawed your arm ?

984
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,939
- Yeah.
- Didn't you just tell the court...

985
01:14:57,007 --> 01:14:58,939
-Jessica had scratched your arm ?
- Yeah, but--

986
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:01,996
Didn't you tell SheriffJohnson you
got scratched by the stray cat...

987
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:04,005
because she didn't like it
when you killed her ?

988
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:06,437
Yeah, but I was lying.

01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:38,102
What are you
doing here ?

1155
01:35:45,269 --> 01:35:47,257
Youseeingsomething ?

1156
01:35:56,601 --> 01:36:00,624
I've been thinking
some reaIbad, badthoughts.

1157
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,961

1158
01:36:02,034 --> 01:36:05,261
I'm gIadthatgirIis dead.
Jessica.

1159
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:08,527
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.

1160
01:36:12,432 --> 01:36:15,989
I couldn't sleep.
Met the girls for a drink.

1161
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:19,490
Take offyour clothes.

1162
01:36:25,732 --> 01:36:28,720
[Jessica's Voice]

1163
01:36:28,797 --> 01:36:32,524
[Duncan's Voice] There'sa saying
about Ietting sIeeping dogs Iie.

1164
01:36:33,697 --> 01:36:37,822
You just fucked him,
didn't you ? Hmm ?

1165
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:43,061
Donnie Barksdale ?

1166
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:46,161
So ?

1167
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:49,888
Why would you do this to me ?
Hmm ? I love you.

1168
01:36:49,962 --> 01:36:52,120
Maybe I wanted to be
with a man for a change.

1169
01:36:52,195 --> 01:36:54,626
- Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth. Fuckyou !

1170
01:36:54,694 --> 01:36:57,489
- I'm sorry.
- We're through.

1171
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:00,288
I don't like being spied on.

1172
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:03,622
The only reason I'm with you
is 'cause my daddy likes you.

1173
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:08,125
You horrible little bitch !

1174
01:37:08,193 --> 01:37:10,954
I'll show you a bitch ifyou
don't let go of me. Let go !

1175
01:37:33,024 --> 01:37:35,387
- I think we better go back.
- Nothing's coming to you ?

1176
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:39,323
No.

1177
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:41,617
Nothing.

1178
01:37:50,521 --> 01:37:52,453
You know.

1179
01:37:55,321 --> 01:37:59,117
I knew if I got you close enough
to it that you'd see it.

1180
01:37:59,188 --> 01:38:02,551
- Wayne, I told you--
- No, no. It's okay.

1181
01:38:02,621 --> 01:38:04,813
I swear to God, Annie,
it's okay. It's okay.

1182
01:38:04,886 --> 01:38:06,875
I wanted you to.
I swear to God.

1183
01:38:06,953 --> 01:38:10,908
I wanted you to see it so bad.
I mean, that's why we're here.

1184
01:38:10,987 --> 01:38:13,544
I'm not some killer, Annie.
I'm not.

1185
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,881
You don't-- I mean, do you know
what it was like with her ?

1186
01:38:16,952 --> 01:38:20,611
She was so fucking hurtful
and spiteful and all of it--

1187
01:38:20,685 --> 01:38:22,275
Wayne, I'm not gonna--

1188
01:38:22,352 --> 01:38:25,045
But all of itjust happened
in this flash ofa moment.

1189
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:28,572
- Wayne, I--
- Listen to me. I'm agoodman.

1190
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:31,912
If it had been you instead of her,
none ofthis would have happened.

1191
01:38:31,984 --> 01:38:34,143
Wayne.

1192
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:38,981
It's all right, you know ?

1193
01:38:39,049 --> 01:38:42,277
I won't-- I won't tell.

1194
01:38:45,382 --> 01:38:48,507
I-I-I won't--
I won't tell anybody.

1195
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:52,238
No, Annie--

1196
01:40:05,807 --> 01:40:08,136
You all right, Mrs. Wilson ?

1197
01:40:56,962 --> 01:41:00,860
I thought you were supposed to
be in the hospital.

1198
01:41:00,928 --> 01:41:04,690
I escaped, Mrs. Wilson.

1199
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:07,159
I'm free.

1200
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:11,493
Buddy, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there foryou.

1201
01:41:13,194 --> 01:41:16,216
- I should've--
- Now, don'tyousayanother word.

1202
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:23,153
You was the onIyone
that wasa friendto me.

1203
01:41:24,659 --> 01:41:26,591
And I love you.

1204
01:41:30,092 --> 01:41:33,717
You're the soul
ofthis town, Mrs. Wilson.

1205
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:37,950
And you just need to keep doing
what you're doing.

1206
01:41:53,255 --> 01:41:55,187
I washed it.

1207
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,817
Will you come back
into town with me ?

1208
01:42:12,886 --> 01:42:14,818
Yeah.

1209
01:42:30,652 --> 01:42:33,981
You know you're
gonna have to go back.

1210
01:42:35,818 --> 01:42:38,375
Yes, ma'am, I know.

1211
01:43:11,313 --> 01:43:13,245
Can I have your keys,
ma'am ?

1212
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:36,968
WeII,

1213
01:43:37,178 --> 01:43:40,405
I just talked to Wayne.

1214
01:43:40,477 --> 01:43:43,466
He pretty much admitted
to everything.

1215
01:43:43,544 --> 01:43:47,908
I've known that boy
half my life.

1216
01:43:51,576 --> 01:43:54,507
Itjust goes to show,
you can know somebody and...

1217
01:43:58,241 --> 01:44:00,173
not know 'em.

1218
01:44:02,808 --> 01:44:06,205
How's his, um--
How's his head ?

1219
01:44:06,274 --> 01:44:08,399
Well, you put
a pretty good dent in it.

1220
01:44:08,474 --> 01:44:11,372
Oh, no, Sheriff,
I told, uh--

1221
01:44:11,441 --> 01:44:13,633
I told the deputy
it wasn't me who did that.

1222
01:44:13,707 --> 01:44:16,764
It was, um--
It was Buddy Cole. He saved me.

1223
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:19,862
- No, ma'am. It weren't Buddy.
- Well, yes, it was.

1224
01:44:19,939 --> 01:44:23,462
- Why don't you just ask Wayne ?
- I did.

1225
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:25,868
He don't remember
what happened.

1226
01:44:25,938 --> 01:44:28,200
Head injuries is funny.

1227
01:44:28,272 --> 01:44:33,397
-I'm telling you, it was Buddy Cole.
-What I'm tryin' to say is,

1228
01:44:33,471 --> 01:44:35,800
it couldn't have been Buddy.

1229
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:38,336
I-- Ijust caIIedup
at theState HospitaI.

1230
01:44:38,404 --> 01:44:41,699
- He told me he escaped.
- Ma 'am.

1231
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:45,794
Buddy Cole is dead.

1232
01:44:48,236 --> 01:44:50,758
