1
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,281
Mr. Dobson,

2
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,985
it's time for us to do what
the Good Lord would refer to

3
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,358
as a "cleansing of the wicked,"

4
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,227
and what my brother George,
God rest his soul,

5
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,029
used to call
"100% Alabama ass kickin'."

6
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,494
So you think we're gonna
die here today?

7
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,268
Dying's not an option.
Now, you stick that back

8
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,867
in that gray matter of yours
and you make that stick,

9
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,538
'cause any other thought's
gonna get you cold-slabbed,

10
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,311
toe-tagged and mailed home to your
mom in a plastic bag. Are we crystal?

11
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,648
- Crystal, sir.
- Gentlemen!

12
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,381
Let's do what
God made us to do.

13
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:30,024
This is Sheriff John Quincey Wydell...

14
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,759
of the Ruggsville County
Sheriffs Department.

15
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,858
You're completely surrounded!

16
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,604
You have no chance of escape!

17
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,376
Now would be the time
to vacate the premises peacefully.

18
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,342
There's a million
fucking cops!

19
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,247
Come on.

20
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,149
Otis, the fucking pigs
are everywhere!

21
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,848
- Tell me something I don't know!
- We've gotta do something!

22
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,120
You're completely surrounded.
You have no chance of escape.

23
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,161
Can't take the car,
about 25 pigs.

24
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,594
I know, I know!
Shit fuck shit fuck!

25
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,495
Shit.
Where the fuck is Tiny?

26
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,363
- I ain't seen Tiny.
- Tiny!

27
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,267
- I think he went out last night.
- Everybody shut up!

28
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,242
Mama, what's the matter?

29
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,650
I keep thinking
about... old times...

30
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,848
Iike when you was
a fuckin' baby.

31
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,756
- You looked like an angel.
- I know, Mama.

32
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,818
- You told me that a million times.
- Yeah.

33
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,761
Gentlemen!

34
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,257
On the count of three!

35
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,496
- Ready?
- Yeah.

36
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,802
- One!
- I love you, Mama.

37
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,399
- I love you, Baby.
- Two!

38
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,845
Let's go.

39
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,715
Three!

40
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,520
Fucking pigs!

41
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,034
Stupid motherfucker!

42
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,839
Die, you fuckers!

43
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,553
- You okay?!
- Yeah, are you?

44
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,816
Fuck!

45
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,022
- Ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah, go go!

46
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,203
Wydell:
Man down!

47
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,725
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

48
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,887
Dobson! Get some tear-gas
in that house!

49
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,794
Sir!

50
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,460
Mama!

51
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,399
Let's go! Let's go!

52
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,040
Do not fucking move!

53
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,956
I advise you
to lower that weapon.

54
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,827
I'm sorry, Sheriff,

55
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,885
but you ain't gettin' me.

56
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,193
Looks like you ain't
gettin' off that easy,

57
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,236
huh, bitch?

58
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,805
All right, everybody listen up.

59
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,773
I want this place gone over
with a fine-tooth comb.

60
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,242
Wherever these fuckers are,

61
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,109
- they gotta be close.
- I am standing outside the perimeter

62
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,344
of what is turning out to be
the most horrific crime scene

63
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,681
since Jack the Ripper
stalked the streets of London.

64
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,221
What police have uncovered
reads like this--

65
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,258
words can't describe it--

66
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,657
"Human skulls
used as ornaments,

67
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,163
body parts stuffed
in refrigerators. "

68
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,358
And I can't believe
what it says here:

69
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,628
"A mass grave
of decomposing bodies

70
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,330
dumped under the crawlspace
of the house."

71
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,569
Hey, Chief, you might wanna
check this out.

72
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,614
- What?
- I don't know.

73
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,350
Jesus H Christ.

74
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,387
Motherfucker.

75
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,981
What, you recognize the clown?

76
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,992
Yeah, his name is Spaulding,

77
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,028
Captain fucking Spaulding.

78
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,225
Oh, yeah! Ooh, yes!
Gimme-- give it to me!

79
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

80
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,793
Yeah, ride the horse, baby!
Ride it!

81
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,238
Ride it! Yeah yeah yeah.

00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,578
God! Oh, yeah, honey.
Oh-ho!

83
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,580
- Give it to me.

84
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,809
- Oh, yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- You're the captain.

85
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,182
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah yeah yeah...

86
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,221
Oh, ride me, baby.
Ride it, ride it.

87
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,552
Ride it!
Feels so good!

88
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,092
Yeah! Yes, give it!
Give it up! Give it!

89
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,990
Give it, give it!
Yeah! Oh!

90
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,553
Come on, baby, ride it home!
Yeah yeah yeah...

91
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,793
- Yes! Yeah!
- Yeah, oh!

92
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,885
Ah! Oh, honey!

93
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,717
You gettin'
a good ride tonight.

94
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,584
Next time, you gonna
have to pay me.

95
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,589
Did you just call me
a fucking whore?

96
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,157
Well, I calls 'em
like I sees 'em.

97
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,203
Really?

98
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,033
You think I'm
a fucking whore?

99
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,266
I don't think it,
I know it.

100
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,673
- Whore this, fucker.
- Hey hey hey hey!

101
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,578
Come on now, baby,
hold on.

102
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,708
I'm just messing with ya.
You know us clowns,

103
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,915
we like to just fool around
a bunch, you know? Come on.

104
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,926
- Yeah.
- Laugh.

105
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,132
Clown... Iaugh!

106
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,438
Poopy.

107
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,635
What's the matter,
bad dream?

108
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,873
Yeah, 50-50.

109
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,915
You want to fool
around some more?

110
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,679
Oh, Jesus Christ, woman,
I gotta take a piss.

111
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,743
- No.
- Didn't you get enough ass-banging

112
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,847
Iast night?
God damn it, my dick is still sore.

113
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,949
- Oh, come on, I'm horny.
- No.

114
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,119
Most guys like
that quality in a girl.

115
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,825
Yeah, except you acting like some
kinda spastic mongoloid in heat.

116
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,172
- Fuckin' bitch.
- Hurry!

117
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,508
Spaulding: Ah...

118
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,912
Where is it?

119
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,413
Just calm down,
it'll be on in a minute.

120
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,042
Ah! Ha ha!
There it is!

121
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,484
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

122
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,488
- Yeah.
- You look so sexy.

123
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,890
Captain Spaulding again. I'm here to
tell you about a brand-new attraction.

124
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,397
Mary... the monkey.
Oh yeah, that's right.

125
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,261
- Ha! That fuckin' monkey.
- This here little monkey

126
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,597
... is half real human, half monkey...
- I love that monkey.

127
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,432
...I brought all the way
from the wilds of Borneo.

128
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,271
When y'all come in, make sure you bring
little Johnny and Suzie with you.

129
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,333
She'll scare
the holy guacamole out of 'em.

130
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,972
Ha ha! And remember
while you're down here,

131
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,949
pick up a "Captain Spaulding
for president" T-shirt

132
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,952
all shapes and--

133
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,250
Hey, what the fuck is this?

134
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,449
I paid good money for
this goddamn commercial!

135
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,460
Sheriff, "News Update,"
what is the situation now?

136
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,258
The situation?

137
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,298
Now what?
God damn it!

138
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,668
- What are you--
- Yeah, what?

139
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,363
- Daddy, you gotta get outta there.
- Why?

140
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,566
- The pigs hit us this morning real bad.
- Shut the fuck up!

141
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:00,305
- They're gonna be coming for you too.
- All right, just calm down.

142
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,213
I'll meet you at the Kahiki Palms Motel
just like we always planned.

143
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,514
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

144
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,554
All right,
just go now.

145
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,787
Poopy!

146
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,958
What do you need a gun for?
Where are we going?

147
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,298
- You ain't going nowhere, bitch.
- Oh, Poopy!

148
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,064
Get outta my fuckin' way!

149
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,596
If you're out there listening to this,
I got a message for ya.

150
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,337
I'm coming to get ya.
You can't run forever.

151
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,539
You're gonna have to stop
somewhere, sometime, and when you do

152
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,811
I'm gonna be there to put the wrath
of the Lord up your ass.

153
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,374
Poopy, don't go!

154
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,852
God damn it,
stop calling me Poopy!

155
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,980
- But, Poopy--
- Leave me alone, woman!

156
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,252
- I want my Poopy! Poopy, no!
- Leave me alone!

157
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,670
In an attempt to help the Ruggsville
Police Department,

158
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,710
we here at "News Update"

159
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,405
would like to show you
these mug shots of the suspects

160
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,779
known to have escaped
during the raid earlier this morning.

161
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,744
100. 150.

162
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,581
175.

163
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,221
184 bucks?
What?!

164
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,226
- Candy!
- What?

165
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,923
Candy, come on down here!
Come on, cut that out.

166
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,965
Turn it off.
Candy, come down here!

167
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,233
- Come on down here!
- All right. Shit.

168
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,273
What?

169
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,207
This is bullshit, baby!
What is this?

170
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,110
What do you want me to say?
It's a slow fuckin' night, boss.

171
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,149
All them farmers want is
a quickie hand job and boom!

172
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,891
10 dolla!

173
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,759
Get back on their tractors,
save the real fucking for the sheep.

174
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,923
Jesus, Candy, you gotta figure
a way to hook 'em in.

175
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,968
You gotta hustle
that pussy.

176
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,300
Find a new angle and you might
attract a higher clientele.

177
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, well, I've been
thinking about that.

178
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,068
I was thinking about something spacey
like that "Star Wars" shit.

179
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,911
You know, them losers wanna
fuck Princess Leia, right?

180
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,951
I'd fuck her.

181
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,248
Thank you.

182
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,948
I don't know, you start messing
with that spacey shit,

183
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,218
and you'll really bring out
some sick bitches.

184
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,692
They all wanting
to pretend they're robots.

185
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,924
Last thing I need is horny robots
running around, tripping over shit.

186
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,364
Droids... boss,
they call 'em droids.

187
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,425
Whatever.
I still say it's risky.

188
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,237
Wong's Hong Kong Gardens,

189
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,277
this is Mr. Wong speaking.

190
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,608
Cut the shit, Charlie.
It's me, Cutter.

191
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,547
I got a serious meltdown
going on down here

192
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,779
and I need a place to cool out,
so I'm coming down.

193
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,118
Fuck, man, I don't think it's such
a great idea, you coming around here.

194
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,124
I am coming down... now.

195
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,217
- Whoa, ho-- hold it!
- Fuck.

196
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,024
Hold it!

197
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,495
Fuck!

198
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,321
Man, I don't see him.

199
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,151
Shit, where the fuck is he?

200
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,985
Jesus! Can we get
over this already?

201
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,655
I mean, I just don't
find it funny anymore.

202
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,994
I don't know,
it's still pretty funny.

203
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,899
- I'd say so.
- I hate to be the one

204
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,267
- to tell you I told you so--
- Then don't.

205
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,831
--but ridin' a mechanical bull
is not as easy as it looks.

206
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,537
Technically, she had
a pretty good ride...

207
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,772
until tragedy struck.

208
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,872
Hey, the lesson here is

209
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:35,215
that tube tops are not the proper attire
for bull riding, Glory.

210
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,879
I agree with you.

211
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,924
You gonna have to put a harness
on them little suckers, honey.

212
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,516
Her "tig bitties"
were flappin' around--

213
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,290
My titties don't flap!

214
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,629
They looked like two raccoons
in a gunnysack fighting to get out.

215
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,759
- Oh, Adam, shut up.
- When her top fell down,

216
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,770
I was gonna pee myself!

217
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,533
"l was gonna pee myself!"

218
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,074
You're just jealous
'cause you don't have any titties.

219
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,702
Oh, Gloria, come on,
no reason to get mean.

220
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,746
Come on, baby.

221
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,508
You had one titty going this way

222
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,983
and one titty going that way.
It was pretty amazing.

223
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,317
Chances are high you made
a few fans that night.

224
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,050
Oh, shut up, dipshit.

225
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,217
Well, I told Johnny Cash,
and he said--

226
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,090
did you know I shook hands
with Johnny Cash once?

227
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,598
Roy, how about you go
find me the ice machine?

228
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,599
I need a drink.

229
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,125
I'll get you the ice, but you gotta
promise us an encore tomorrow.

230
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,172
Roy!

231
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,970
You wish, honey.
Don't you wish.

232
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,033
The babes are
going into seclusion.

233
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,241
Man over radio:
The leader of this group who is

234
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,478
a local celebrity goes by the name
of Captain Spaulding

235
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,112
along with two other
suspects known as Otis--

236
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,179
Aw, shit fuck
shit fuck!

237
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,724
God, calm down.
Get rid of the car.

238
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,657
Don't worry,
I'll get us a room.

239
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,991
- Well, hurry the fuck up!
- Fuck you!

240
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,586
Fuck you!

241
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,624
Police revealed today
that they believe

242
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,465
most of the victims were drugged,
kidnapped and sexually assaulted.

243
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,403
God damn it! Fuck!

244
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,575
Hey, Roy, I was doing some research
on that thing I was telling you about.

245
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,546
- What thing?
- Rodeo clowning.

246
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,241
Rodeo...

247
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,050
A rodeo clown?
You been smoking dope.

248
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,754
Yeah-- I mean no,
not right now.

249
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,424
Let me tell you
something.

250
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,866
You spend one second in that pen
and that bulI'd have his horn

251
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:34,394
up your ass
and sticking out your pecker.

252
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,441
That's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

253
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,501
You know, you can never be supportive
of anything I wanna do.

254
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,376
What do you
want me to say?

255
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,416
That you're dressed for the part
and headed in the right direction?

256
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,452
Well, Adam was saying...

257
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,544
I've always been
good with animals.

258
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,589
I mean, dogs love me.

259
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,056
And isn't a horse
kinda like a big dog?

260
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,526
I don't know.

261
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,327
No, you're not
clown material.

262
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,733
Forget it. I'm gonna walk
on over to the gas station.

263
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,568
- You want anything?
- No-- yes.

264
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,165
Get me some
of that beef jerky.

265
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,211
Thanks for talking.

266
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,304
I could've been on that pit crew
down in North Carolina.

267
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,952
Yeah.

268
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,235
Baby:
Meow! Meow.

269
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,271
Hey, pussycat.

270
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,974
Hey, got a light?

271
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,341
No, uh, I don't smoke.

272
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,373
My doctor says I got lungs
like a professional athlete.

273
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,442
Ah, I get it.
You wanna live forever.

274
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,488
Yeah yeah, well...

275
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,525
So what, are you on vacation
all by yourself or something?

276
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:05,052
Yeah-- no. I'm actually out here
with my singing group.

277
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,461
I do the lead singing for it.

278
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,328
It's called
"Banjo and Sullivan."

279
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,301
I used to sing with Johnny Cash.
He shook my hand.

280
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,202
I love famous people. They're so much
better than the real thing.

281
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:18,265
Well, yeah,
I suppose they are.

282
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,834
I bet all the girls
wanna fuck you.

283
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:28,410
- Would you say that again?
- I bet all the girls wanna fuck you.

284
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,454
( both laughing )

285
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,393
Do you kiss your mama
with that mouth?

286
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,897
Trust me, fella, that ain't
the only thing I do with this mouth.

287
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,331
Don't tell me that!
What? Say that again.

288
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,925
That I ain't the only thing
I do with this mouth.

289
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,971
It's so depressing.

290
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,439
Let's talk about some of the symbols
of these groups

291
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,408
Iike the inverted cross
or the pentagram

292
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,412
or the number 666
left at the scene of the crime.

293
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,879
What do you
think about that?

294
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,718
This is not
an isolated incident.

295
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,693
Well, members of these cults
realize they have no chance

296
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,753
of attacking God directly.

297
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:17,325
- So the next best thing...
- Adam, could you switch this?

298
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:21,805
- I can't stand to hear about this.
- What do I look like, Roy?

299
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,239
I'm Sullivan,

300
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,641
Roy Sullivan.

301
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,679
Well... Roy Sullivan.

302
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,910
You gonna take me
back to your room and play with me?

303
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,913
My wife's in that room.

304
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,749
Or is my brother
gonna have to shoot

305
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,516
your fucking teeth
out of your head?

306
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,859
Okay, let's go, Hoss.
Move it.

307
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,657
Just makes me sick
to my stomach to think

308
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,858
that we live in a world
where there are Satanic cults.

309
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,026
Come on, Gloria,
it's a bunch of crap.

310
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,570
- I don't know.
- Look at these two idiots.

311
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,005
They're just exaggerating all this shit
to try and kick up ratings.

312
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,135
They wanna get people scared
so they stay at home,

313
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,611
buy TV dinners.
Fuck me running.

314
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,139
I don't know about that.
That business down in Ruggsville...

315
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,742
Ruggsville?
Ruggsville can kiss my ass.

316
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,152
Ain't nothing but a bunch
of local cousinfuckers

317
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,156
corn-holing the livestock.

318
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,625
Could you just switch it
for me anyway, please?

319
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,131
Jesus Christ, I don't know
how Roy puts up with your shit.

320
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,367
What is taking Roy
so long, anyway?

321
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,601
- Hey!
- On the bed now!

322
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,370
- Get on the bed!
- Let me check my-- all right.

323
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,674
- Easy!
- What's going on here, Roy?

324
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,737
Shut up! Did I tell you
to fucking speak?

325
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,443
- Hey! Hey! Quiet! Quiet!
- Did I tell you you could talk?

326
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,179
Roy, what the hell is this?

327
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,847
- God damn it, look at that jacket.
- What?

328
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,754
On TV.

329
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,694
- Well, fuck the TV.
- Fuck the TV? Fuck you!

330
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,095
Will you keep your head
on the business at hand?

331
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,025
- Who's in the shower?
- That's my wife!

332
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,094
- God damn it!
- Don't fuck with.22.

333
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,607
What are you gonna do, man?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

334
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,700
I wanna know what the fuck
are you gonna do?

335
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,748
Wendy!

336
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,215
Get the fuck out of here!

337
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,490
Don't hurt her, please.

338
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,856
Is this everyone?

339
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,259
Hey, Roy. Open up.

340
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,961
I got some of that Dr. Corndog's
hickory-smoked jerky.

341
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,294
Who the fuck is that?

342
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,500
That's Jimmy.
He's our roadie.

343
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,702
I forgot all about him.

344
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,302
Baby, you all right?

345
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,508
Now I know
I can't trust you!

346
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,313
I'll get him.

347
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:52,083
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I got the wrong room.

348
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,091
I'm looking for
room number two.

349
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,650
No, you got the right room.
Come on in.

350
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,596
- Is Roy in there?
- Roy's in here, all right. Come on in.

351
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,427
Get your ass in here!
On your knees!

352
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,992
Roy, help--

353
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,441
Shut up!

354
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,211
We're at the scene
of a horrific multiple murder.

355
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,345
- No telling how many--
- God damn it!

356
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,218
Fuck!

357
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,554
... in the process
of recovering the corpses

358
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,957
which are in varying states
of decomposition.

359
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,395
It's currently being treated
as a sign of a mass homicide.

360
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,262
- If initial figures prove--
- ( radio shuts off )

361
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,235
Come on, honey.
Mommy has to get to work.

362
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,535
If I'm late one more time,
Mr. McDonnell is gonna can my ass.

363
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,576
I am hurrying!
I dropped something.

364
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,076
Will you get in the car?!

365
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,976
Okay, come on, let's go get in.

366
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,713
- Mom, a clown.
- Yeah yeah, a clown.

367
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,345
Oh-- hi.

368
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,880
Hi. I'm gonna have to
be taking your car today.

369
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,052
See, I have some
top-secret clown business

370
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,392
that supersedes any plans that you
might have for this here vehicle.

371
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,991
What's that about clown business?

372
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,332
Do I stutter, bitch?

373
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,342
Jamie, get in the car.
Lock the door.

374
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,810
Where the hell you going?
Damn it.

375
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,144
Don't you never turn your back
on a fucking clown

376
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,116
- when he's talking to you!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

377
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,093
What's the matter, kid?
Don't you like clowns?

378
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,888
Why? Don't we
make you laugh?

379
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,835
Aren't we fucking funny?
You best come up with an answer

380
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,306
'cause I'm gonna come back here
and check on you and your mama.

381
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,173
If you ain't got a reason
why you hate clowns,

382
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,179
I'm gonna kill your
whole fucking family.

383
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,875
All right, now get
your fucking ass out the car!

384
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,747
Go on!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

385
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,549
Shit! Woo!

386
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,361
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

387
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:24,869
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

388
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,778
Chinese, Japanese,

389
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,077
dirty knees, look at these.

390
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:40,755
Hoss, are you staring
at my sister thinking bad thoughts?

391
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,952
No.

392
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,392
Why not? You a faggot?

393
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,157
No.

394
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,393
Well, what are you?
I mean, you got this hot piece of ass

395
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,401
shaking her shit right
in front of you

396
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,495
and you're not getting any ideas?
What do you call that?

397
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,164
I'm a married man.

398
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,765
A married fucking man.

399
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,606
Hey, that's just great!

400
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,647
Let's give him a big round
of applause, folks, for the married man!

401
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,706
Come on!

402
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,876
Woo! Married man!

403
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,920
All right. Wow.

404
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,354
Okay, Mama,
front and center, on your feet.

405
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,357
Don't hurt her.

406
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,258
Get on your feet.
Come on.

407
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,989
Let's go.

408
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,724
Please, mister,
this is insane.

409
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,358
Boy... the next word
that comes outta your mouth

410
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,925
better be some brilliant
fucking Mark Twain shit,

411
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,905
'cause it's definitely getting
chiseled on your tombstone.

412
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,377
Okay, come on, Mama.
Take that shit off,

413
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,812
Iet's see what's been holding Hoss's
balls at attention all these years.

414
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,679
What?

415
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,083
What? Take off your clothes,

416
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,246
or one of these assholes
is going to die.

417
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,168
Come on, come on.

418
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,364
Shit, way to go, Roy!
She ain't too bad.

419
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,999
She got a tight
little ass on her!

420
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,945
And she got some
child-rearing hips.

421
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,513
Huh, yeah, hey.

422
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,916
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

423
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,479
Here, ooh, Jeez.
Roy, beginning to see what you mean.

424
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,491
Whoa.

425
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,356
Please don't hurt me.

426
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,737
You like this, don't ya?

427
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,673
Say "Yes, I do."

428
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,370
You like that, don't ya?
Say "Yes, I do."

429
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,413
Yes, I do.

430
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,053
Yes, I do.

431
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,353
Yes, l-- I do.

432
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Okay.

433
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,928
Okay, now.

434
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,266
Give me some sugar.
Make it sweet.

435
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,102
Don't want me to tense
up my trigger finger.

436
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,301
- My finger's getting tense...

437
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,588
I want you to say,
"You're the almighty devil,

438
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,962
and I want you to make me
my filthy whore."

439
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,434
Come on, say it.
I know it.

440
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,200
I know you're
feeling it. Say it.

441
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,298
You're... the...
almighty... devil

442
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,869
and I want you...
to make me your... fucking whore.

443
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,666
You make me sick.

444
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,968
Woo-hoo!

445
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,770
I feel like we're all really getting
to know each other now.

446
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,779
All right, ladies.
Me and the boys have an errand to run.

447
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,915
We'll be back
in a little while.

448
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,507
Come on, Hoss,
move it.

449
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,951
Come on, shit stain!
Gotta go!

450
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,989
Come on!
God damn it!

451
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,492
Authorities struggle to
comprehend the grizzly remains found

452
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,123
in what is now being called the most
heinous crime in American history.

453
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,360
The group responsible
for these murders

454
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,870
is now being referred to as "The Devil's
Rejects" by the local media.

455
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,463
A woman known only
as "Mother Firefly"

456
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,474
was taken into
police custody today

457
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,067
after a violent
gun battle with police

458
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,137
that left four officers
dead and seven wounded.

459
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,012
I'm Derek Sanderson

460
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,074
bringing the world
to your doorstep.

461
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,621
Open the gate.

462
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,661
Ma'am...

463
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,763
my name is Sheriff
John Quincey Wydell.

464
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,966
Let's see
who we got here.

465
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,774
Miss Gloria T easdale,

466
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,644
alias Eve Wilson,

467
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,707
alias Southern Betty Woods...

468
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,117
Betsy Woods.

469
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,214
And of course,

470
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,282
alias Mother Firefly.

471
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,658
You can read.

472
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,788
Congratulations.

473
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,128
Four counts,
grand theft auto.

474
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,168
Five counts,
armed robbery.

475
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,499
What's this?
Looks like your specialty...

476
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,670
17 counts, solicitation
and prostitution.

477
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,412
You've been one busy whore.

478
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,281
I bet them old farmboys love you.

479
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,718
Everyone loves me.

480
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,815
Don't you pretend...

481
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,950
you don't fancy me.

482
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,928
Oh, yes, ma'am.

483
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,896
I find you quite irresistible.

484
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,024
- Dobson.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,264
- Put them books over there.
- Got it.

486
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,832
Ma'am, you recognize
these books, here?

487
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,847
Yeah.

488
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:41,010
Oh! Ain't she an angel?

489
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,521
Well, she gonna be one dead angel
when I catch up to her--

490
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,853
you, your whole clan,
you dead already.

491
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,258
You're just ghosts,
just waiting to expire.

492
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,957
The way I figure it,
only choice you got

493
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,829
is to cooperate
and tell me where they are.

494
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,392
That way your little
angel over there

495
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,405
don't have to die like no dog
in the streets when I catch her.

496
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:06,671
- Are you done trying to scare me?
- No, ma'am.

497
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,837
With God as my witness...

498
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,972
I have only just begun.

499
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,676
Oh... Sheriff...

500
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,742
can I show you something?

501
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,185
I'll need this book here.

502
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,225
I did never...

503
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,059
get around to putting these
in the book proper.

504
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,995
And I thought...

505
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,930
you might enjoy them.

506
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,059
Oh... you know...

507
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,263
he was a real sweetie pie.

508
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,774
Tall...

509
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,470
big moustache...

510
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,774
bald head...

511
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,577
You know,
I feel contrite

512
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,277
about blowing
his brains out,

513
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:52,379
'cause he seemed
like such a nice man.

514
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,619
I think...

515
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,629
he said... his name
was also Wydell.

516
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,200
Was he kin to you?

517
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,076
Listen to me,

518
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,544
you gonna listen to me good.

519
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,638
I'm going to kill every
member of your family.

520
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,276
I am gonna hunt them down
like animals and skin 'em alive.

521
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,753
They are gonna feel the pain
and suffering of every last victim.

522
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,588
They're gonna crawl on their hands
and knees and beg me for mercy,

523
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,127
but all I'm gonna
have for 'em is pain.

524
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,822
- You're dead!

525
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,101
You go get 'em, Sheriff!

526
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,334
Go get your ghost!

00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:47,434

00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:53,609
You found yourself into something

529
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,650
We'll get ya!

530
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,852
We'll get ya!
You're dead, Sheriff!

531
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,919
You're dead!
I'll see you

532
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:10,330
in fucking hell!

533
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,804
Hey, Hoss,
you like this song?

534
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,808
Do you like this song?

535
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,710
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess so.

536
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,753
Oh, really?

537
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,312
- Which way?
- Take a right.

538
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,916
You like that T op 40 shit?

539
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,962
I thought you
were like some kinda

540
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,624
true-blue-balls-earnest-kill-'em
country fucker.

541
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,634
You're nothing but a city faggot
with a cowboy hat.

542
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,001
Stop here.

543
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,646
Okay, get out.

544
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,010
This way.

545
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,363
Follow the yellow brick road.

546
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,037
Otis:
That's right.

547
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,074
Go on.

548
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,286
You know, Hoss,
if I'm not mistaken,

549
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,550
I think I can smell your wife's
pussy-stink on my gun.

550
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,559
Hope it doesn't rust the barrel.

551
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,464
Oh, man.

552
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,968
You know, the stress
of the day is really setting in on me.

553
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:30,300
You guys happen to know how a guy
like me could relieve some tension?

554
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,509
Ah, maybe-- I think
your wife Wendy, boy,

555
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,571
Iooks like she could
relieve some tension.

556
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,776
- Mister, where we going?
- Those little titties--

557
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,648
we're going down
the road here.

558
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,086
Those little titties,
she's got a tight little ass.

559
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,358
Does she like it
when you puke?

560
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,222
Is that part of your deal?

561
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,784
Where you taking us?

562
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,532
Well, I guess, it wouldn't
do no harm to tell you none.

563
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,468
We're gonna go dig up some guns
I buried out here a couple years ago.

564
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,370
- Then what?
- Well, there ain't no "what."

565
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,408
That's the end of the road.

566
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,667
What?

567
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,477
- You're not gonna kill us, are you?
- Killing sounds so permanent.

568
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,181
Adam: We did everything
you want, mister, just let us go.

569
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,019
We did what you said.

570
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:25,425
First of all,
I didn't say anything.

571
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,589
And second of all,
I'm calling the shots!

572
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,758
Consider me fucking
Willy fucking Wonka!

573
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,028
This is my fucking chocolate factory!
You got it?!

574
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,797
My factory--

575
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,805
Get him, Roy!

576
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,841
Get the gun, Roy!

577
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,531
Roy!

578
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,954
Please, mister, stop.
Please.

579
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,956
- Stop.
- Stop?

580
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,584
Bitch, I have just started.

581
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,527
You know, I was gonna take
it easy on you, boy,

582
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,862
but you brought this
down on yourself.

583
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,198
You had to come
all fucking-big-stick- walking-tall

584
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,398
Iike a big, fucking hero!
You got yourself to blame.

585
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,340
Look at you now, hero!
You're gonna fucking bleed to death.

586
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,377
Fuck you!

587
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,975
That's what they all say,
"Fuck you!"

588
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,246
Well, it ain't gonna save ya.
It don't scare me none

589
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,015
and don't make you a hero!

590
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,218
Wanna see what happens
to heroes, boy?

591
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,754
You wanna see bad-ass, motherfucker?
I'll show you bad-ass!

592
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,429
Roy!

593
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,269
Roy!

594
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,536
Hoss, I want you
to pray to your God.

595
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,443
I want you to pray that
He comes and saves you.

596
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,346
I want lightning to come down
and crash upon my fucking head!

597
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:03,352
- I pray... Jesus...
- Louder!

598
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,186
Bless the bunnies,
bless the little birds--

599
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:11,057
- I don't feel anything.
---bless the springtime morning.

600
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,655
I feel it!

601
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,189
Oh, Great God Almighty,
I repent, I repent!

602
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,930
I feel the love
of the God-God-God Almighty!

603
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,235
Oh, the Holy Spirit
is in my body!

604
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,118
I am the devil, and I am here
to do the devil's work.

605
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,487
Roy! Roy!

606
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:52,964
Roy! Roy!

607
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,106
You fucking motherfucker!

608
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,842
You fucking motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!

609
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,010
I've got other
plans for you... hero.

610
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,582
Shut the fuck up!

611
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:53,187
Can I go to the bathroom, please?
I'm about to piss myself.

612
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,364
Excuse me...

613
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,503
Can she go to
the bathroom? Please?

614
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,099
What?! I heard you the first time.
I was just thinking.

615
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,007
What are you
gonna do for me?

616
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,876
- What?
- Go piss yourself for all I care.

617
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,644
If you want special favors, you gotta
give me something in return.

618
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,685
What do you want?

619
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,992
I want you
to hit her in the face.

620
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,961
- What?
- I know you heard me.

621
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,435
Go ahead.

622
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,872
Go on.

623
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,366
Make it hurt,
no love taps.

624
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,411
I want to hear it.

625
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,312
Harder, she ain't gonna break.

626
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,460
You better make this
next one fucking count!

627
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,743
- Ah!

628
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,975
Good, very nice.

629
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,018
Now you come here.

630
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,188
Right here.
Kneel down.

631
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:32,090
Give me a kiss and say, "Thank you,
Baby, I'm having a great time."

632
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,995
Thanks, Baby,
I had a really good time.

633
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,535
Now make it fast, bitch!

634
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,165
Don't try anything cute!

635
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,542
Shit!

636
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,545
Now, what do you
want to do?

637
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,133
Damn it, I knew that cunt
would do something stupid.

638
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,864
Shut up!
Open the fucking door!

639
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,907
- Open the goddamn door!
- Okay! Hold it!

640
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,178
Somebody help me!

641
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,378
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

642
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,513
What did I ever
really do to you?

643
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,491
I swear I'll do it.
I'll kill you.

644
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,494
Why would you
want to kill me?

645
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,689
I'm you're only hope,
my brother's fucking crazy.

646
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,460
- Please!
- Wendy, it's all right!

647
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,160
Come on out--

648
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,426
Go ahead, shoot me.
Shoot me right in the ass!

649
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,858
Stupid cunt!
Ain't no bullets in this thing.

650
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,596
It's all fucking mind power.
