- As in lame.

185
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,389
You couldn't protect...

186
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,258
( sighs )

187
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,894
Hershel or Glenn

188
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:50,429
or Maggie.

189
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,231
Michonne, Daryl,

190
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:56,068
or Mom.

191
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:00,739
You just wanted
to plant vegetables.

192
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,491
You just wanted to hide.

193
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:05,444
He knew where we were
and you didn't care!

194
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,412
You just hid
behind those fences

195
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,197
and waited for...

196
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,732
( sighs )

197
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,534
They're all gone now.

198
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:15,069
Because of you!

199
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,922
They counted on you!

200
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,757
You were their leader!

201
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:27,248
( sniffles )

202
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,267
But now...

203
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,472
you're nothing.

204
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,114
( sniffles )

205
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:47,202
( sighs )

206
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,328
I'd be fine if you died.

207
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,735
( grunts )

208
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,802
( grunts )

209
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:03,307
Damn it.

210
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:08,732
( door creaks )

211
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:11,235
( snarling )

212
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,732
( gunshots )

213
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:32,923
( gunshot )

214
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,410
( clicking )

215
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,718
Oh, shit.

216
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,941
Come on.

217
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:01,702
Come on.

218
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:11,545
Come on.

219
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:12,713
( grunts )

220
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,393
Come on.

221
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:29,680
( whimpering )

222
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:43,944
<i>- ( pounding )</i>
<i>- ( panting )</i>

223

224
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:34,127

225
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:43,837
( walker snarling )

226
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:40,170
( panting )

227
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,685
( sobbing )

228
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:04,837
( raspy breathing )

229
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,175
( gasps )

230
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:19,769
( breathing heavily )

231
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,439
( hammer clicks )

00:35:31,782 --> 00:35:33,766
( crying )

235
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,941
( crying continues )

236
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:51,000
I can't.

237
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:56,005
I was wrong.

238
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,760
Just do it.

239
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:04,597
Carl.
( wheezing )

240
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,938
Don't go outside.

241
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:15,107
Stay safe.

242
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,463
I'm scared.

243
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:44,387
( crying )

244
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,973
I'm scared.

245
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,979
I'm scared.

246
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:36,017
_

247
00:37:54,124 --> 00:37:56,208
Mike.

248
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,546
I miss you.

249
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,604
I missed you even
when I was with you.

250
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:14,527
Back at the camp.

251
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:17,947
It wasn't you who did it.

252
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:25,121
( sighs )

253
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:29,992
You were wrong.

254
00:38:29,993 --> 00:38:32,128
Because I'm still here.

255
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:37,216
And you could be, too.

256
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:39,218
And he could be.

257
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:44,223
( sighs )

258
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,396
I know the answer.

259
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:58,320
I know why.

260
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,974
( sighs )

261
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:04,743
( snarling )

262
00:39:19,893 --> 00:39:22,194
Rick: <i>You shouldn't
have risked it,</i>

263
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:24,330
going out there like that.

264
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:26,699
It's dangerous.

265
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:30,135
I was careful.

266
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,941
It's good that
you found more food.

267
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:41,146
I found even more.

268
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:44,066
But I ate it.

269
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,237
What was it?

270
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:53,626
112 ounces of pudding.

271
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,911
( chuckles )

272
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,385
I know...

273
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:06,839
we'll never get things back
to the way they used to be.

274
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:10,309
What?

275
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,396
I only clung to that for you.

276
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:18,067
For Judith.

277
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:24,056
Now she's gone.

278
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:30,829
And you...

279
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:36,785
you're a man, Carl.

280
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:39,421
You're a man.

281
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:43,792
I'm sorry.

282
00:40:47,547 --> 00:40:49,548
You don't need to be.

283
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:42,318
( sobs )

284
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:00,152
<i>( knocking )</i>

285
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:09,678

286
00:42:16,102 --> 00:42:18,554
( chuckles )

287
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,523
What?

288
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:24,860
It's for you.
