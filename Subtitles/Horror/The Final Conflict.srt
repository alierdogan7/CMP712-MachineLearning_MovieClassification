1
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,324
This way.

2
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:07,763
50,000 years ago, mankind faced
its first major threat of extinction,

3
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:11,482
a devastation rocked by nature: the Ice Age.

4
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:16,567
It lasted 5,000 years, rendered four fifths
of the earth's surface uninhabitable,

5
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,884
and wiped out all but the hardiest
of nature's creations.

6
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,931
One of these few was man.

7
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:27,291
From that devastation
dawned a new age - and a new hope.

8
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:32,925
Phoenix-like, man arose from the frozen
wilderness and set forth upon his dream.

9
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:36,449
Mankind has endured
many catastrophes since then,

10
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,730
but none so grave
as the one which faces him today.

11
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:44,170
The economic crisis of the past decade
has brought inflation, famine and chaos

12
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:46,323
to every corner of the globe.

13
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:51,282
Some label it the Great Recession.
Others are calling it Armageddon,

14
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:55,002
that final upheaval of the world
foretold by the prophets of old.

15
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:59,325
But amid all the pessimism,
one voice rings out its faith in the future:

16
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:03,804
Thorn, the world's leading light
in building a new tomorrow.

17
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,046
Trite, rhetorical,

18
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,011
clich?d, inane.

19
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:14,092
Viewers don't pay
much attention to that, Damien.

20
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:19,322
No, you're right. And there won't be
much attention to that bullshit either.

21
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,883
I said I wanted action, not words.
I wanna see Thorn at work.

22
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:27,285
A thousand starving kids
clamouring for a bellyful of Thorn soya.

23
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,046
Thorn medical teams,
construction, engineering.

24
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:34,809
Instead of which, you spend half the
commercial giving us a third-grade version

25
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:37,282
of the history of the Ice Age.

26
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:42,446
Do we have footage of
the Australian drought relief?

27
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,924
Sure, but nothing new,
and most of it's been seen on TV already.

28
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:52,132
We'll find you something.
In the meantime, go with the old commercial.

29
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,807
I don't want that one used.

30
00:05:56,213 --> 00:06:00,286
- What have we got coming up?
- Botswana next week, then the Aswan Dam.

31
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:04,810
- Can we get a film unit to Botswana?
- Sure, but no relief unit till after the coup.

32
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:09,842
- No one's sure how long that's gonna take.
- All right. It'll have to be the Aswan Dam.

33
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:14,961
Have a film unit there when it goes.
Make sure they give our relief units coverage.

34
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:18,011
Don't let the Red Cross beat them to it.

35
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:20,653
Why don't you go?
Now that would be a real coup.

36
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:24,806
Damien Thorn
supervising relief work in person!

37
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:27,202
No, I've got to stay here.

38
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:30,968
- What for?
- To be on hand when the president calls me.

39
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:37,763
He's gonna offer me the post
of ambassador to Great Britain.

40
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:41,732
- I beg your pardon?
- Are you familiar with the Book of Hebron?

41
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:45,647
No, I don't know anything
about the Book of Hebron.

42
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:52,206
It's in the Apocrypha - one of the more
obscure backwaters of the Septuagint Bible.

43
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,925
"And it shall come to pass
that in the end days

44
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:01,689
the beast shall reign one hundred score
and thirty days and nights."

45
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:05,686
"And the faithful shall cry unto the Lord:

46
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,970
Wherefore art thou in the day of evil?"

47
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,125
"And the Lord shall hear their prayers."

48
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:16,172
"And out of the angel isle
he shall bring forth a deliverer,

49
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:20,769
a holy lamb of God
who shall do battle with the beast...

50
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,893
and shall destroy him."

51
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:29,972
"The beast shall reign one hundred score
and thirty days and nights"

52
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:32,692
is another way of saying seven years.

53
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:35,651
That's the time I've been head of Thorn.

54
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:39,328
"And out of the angel isle
he shall bring forth a deliverer."

55
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:43,850
The "angel isle" - the original Latin
has "exinsula angelorum".

56
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,729
England.

57
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,531
The Second Coming.

58
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:52,049
Only it won't be the beast that is destroyed.

59
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,811
It'll be the Nazarene.

60
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,681
You said you were gonna be offered
the post of ambassador to Great Britain.

61
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:03,606
What about our present ambassador?

62
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,524
Afternoon, sir.

63
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,209
Good afternoon, Mr. Ambassador.

64
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:29,047
Good afternoon, Mr. Ambassador.
I just had Mr. Sears on the line.

65
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:32,887
- No calls from anyone.
- He said it was urgent and I was to remind...

66
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,807
- Press office.
- This is the ambassador.

67
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,361
I want a press conference.
Three o'clock.

68
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,530
Come in.

69
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,164
Oh, my God!

70
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:14,804
I know that.

71
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:19,566
No. I'm not giving out any statements -
to him or to anyone else.

72
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,326
It'll only make matters worse.

73
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:25,962
Make sure that the cable
is noncommittal as well.

74
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:27,885
Yeah.

75
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,567
Let me see it before you send it.

76
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,848
Gee. Can you believe that?

77
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:41,250
Some sons of bitches from
the Egyptian opposition party

78
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:46,691
want us to endorse their condemnation
of Israel for blowing up the Aswan Dam.

79
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,333
How the hell do we know
Israel’s responsible?

80
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,530
- My guess is it's the work of the NLF.
- Who?

81
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:55,650
The Nubian Liberation Front -
a quasi-Marxist outfit.

82
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:59,772
They've had a gripe against Cairo since the
'60s, when the High Aswan Dam was built.

83
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:04,563
They claim that it submerged 50 per cent
of their homeland, which, of course, it did.

84
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,644
Until now.

85
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,202
How'd you get this information?

86
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:14,809
One of our Thorn relief teams - they were
on the scene ahead of the Egyptians.

87
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,683
I wanna take a look at that.

88
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,810
It's quite unofficial, of course.

89
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:27,609
I don't have to point out to you that... if we
can prove it had nothing to do with Israel,

90
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:31,242
we could be averting
one mother of a major flare-up.

91
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:37,568
I'll have to check it myself. I wouldn't want
to feed the White House false information.

92
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,041
As to the other matter,

93
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:44,011
I'm afraid I can't accept the post.

94
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:49,042
If I were ambassador to Great Britain,
I'd have to relinquish my control over Thorn.

95
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:52,443
Hell, no! We can take care of that for you.

96
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:57,922
- It is against the law.
- Then we'll just have to bend it a little.

97
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:01,164
But there are two other conditions.

98
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:03,244
What?

99
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,284
Well, first,

100
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:12,685
it could only be for two years,
because of running for the Senate in '84.

101
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:16,368
And second, I'd want
the presidency of the Youth Council.

102
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:22,531
- I've already promised that to Foster.
- I realise it's a problem.

103
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,281
The NL... what?

104
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,967
The Nubian Liberation Front.

105
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,444
- Craig.
- Yes, Mr. President.

106
00:15:55,533 --> 00:16:00,129
I've just appointed Mr. Damien Thorn as our
new ambassador to the Court of St James.

107
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:03,125
Have Eisenberg prepare
a press release to that effect.

108
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,408
Right away, Mr. President.

109
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,328
- Craig.
- Yes, Mr. President.

110
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:21,290
Add to that that I've also
appointed Mr. Thorn

111
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:25,889
as president of
the United Nations Youth Council.

112
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:29,443
- But I thought...
- Just do it... will you?

113
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,008
Well, Damien,

114
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:41,483
your father would have been
very proud of you.

115
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,088
I appreciate your sentiments, sir.

116
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:55,043
Cassiopeia. Right ascension.
One hour, 16 minutes, 12.

117
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,966
Select declination at 22 degrees

118
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:00,169
on an eight-by-four ratio.

119
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,768
Super grid R-3 at eight diagonal.

120
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:07,482
- Eight diagonal.
- Increase focal length to max.

121
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:12,729
- Hold. OK, Tony. Hard copy.
- Right.

122
00:17:21,413 --> 00:17:25,406
Can I see the cell from June 1953?

123
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:30,446
June 1953...

124
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:33,164
Right here.

125
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,086
And... December 1928.

126
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:57,005
- Well, what would you say?
- I'd say I was dreaming.

127
00:17:57,093 --> 00:18:01,450
- And the rate of acceleration?
- A couple of thousand parsecs, minimum!

128
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:06,926
- I'd say we're in for one hell of a bang.
- No. An alignment, not a collision.

129
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:11,564
Let's transfer to the simulator, see if
we can't get an accurate schedule predict.

130
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:13,644
Right.

131
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:18,802
Whenever you're ready.

132
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:54,363
..verbo sanctifiicatur omnia

133
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:58,571
benedictionem tuam effunde
super scuti istas.

134
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:01,369
Per Christum dominum nostrum.

135
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,844
Amen.

136
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,683
Oh, blessed Saviour,

137
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:14,333
who hath, through the confession

138
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:17,928
of thy departed servant Father Spiletto,

139
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:23,485
revealed unto us the identity
of the Antichrist here on earth.

140
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:27,328
Grant us thy strength and guidance

141
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,881
in our holy mission,

142
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:33,807
that we may rid the world of Damien Thorn

143
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:38,808
and thus ensure the safety
of thy Second Coming.

144
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,324
Oh, Lord,

145
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:46,964
bless these seven sacred knives
from Megiddo,

146
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:52,411
which thou hast seen fit to return unto us,

147
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:56,247
that they may serve their holy purpose

148
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:00,805
and destroy the Prince of Darkness,

149
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:06,126
even as he seeketh to destroy
thy child of light.

150
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:19,087
I now call upon each of you
to come forward

151
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,722
and arm yourselves in the name of the Lord.

152
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:25,684
Brother Martin.

153
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,604
Brother Paulo.

154
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:44,961
Each of us must pray to our Lord
in the silence of his own soul.

155
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:49,888
Since we are prepared to lay down our lives
in the pursuit of this enterprise,

156
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:54,171
we must seek
final absolution from God now,

157
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,485
Lest we be denied the redemption
of the blessed last sacrament

158
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,564
at the moment of death.

159
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:06,649
Above all, we must ask God to grant us
courage, guidance and strength,

160
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:11,966
as we prepare to do battle
with Satan and his son, the Antichrist.

161
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:18,242
The exact hour of our Lord's Second Coming,
for which centuries have wept,

162
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,531
has now been revealed to us
by signs in the heavens.

163
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:28,245
It is imperative that the destruction
of the Antichrist takes place before then,

164
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,689
and we have but a short time
in which to carry it out.

165
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:38,005
My brothers, remember that
these seven daggers and ourselves

166
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:42,609
are all that stand between
the son of Satan and the Son of God,

167
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:44,809
for they alone can destroy him.

168
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:57,132
- Can't quite place it, can you?
- No.

169
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:03,611
Waiter, let me have a look at the label on
the bottle of wine we're drinking, will you?

170
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:14,003
Is he really only 32?

171
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:18,450
No idea. Shouldn't be surprised.
Americans always seem to think

172
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:22,731
- they can run before they can walk.
- Like their wine, what?

173
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:28,125
The answer is yes. He's the youngest
ambassador ever appointed by the president.

174
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,967
- Are you part of his staff?
- I'm his private secretary, Harvey Dean.

175
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:34,772
- Kate Reynolds, British television.
- My wife Barbara.

176
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,844
- How do you do?
- We're fine.

177
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:41,171
- Lafite-Thorn.
- Must have bought the bugger out!

178
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:45,686
Amazing what they can make
with soya beans these days.

179
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:50,051
- Would you like to meet the ambassador?
- Yes. Yes, I would. Thank you.

180
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:52,124
Be back in a jiffy.

181
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:54,564
- Good evening, Mrs. Dean.
- Hello.

182
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,565
- When is the happy event?
- Next week, I hope.

183
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:05,686
Damien. I'd like you to meet Kate Reynolds.
Miss Reynolds works for British television.

184
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:10,962
She has her own weekly news show.
It's called The Worldin Vision.

185
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:14,284
- In Focus.
- Excuse me. The Worldin Focus.

186
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:17,445
Or out of focus, as the case may be.

187
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:23,013
How do you do, Miss Reynolds?
The Barbara Walters of British television?

188
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:27,245
On my salary? They don't call us the
British Broadcasting Charity for nothing(!)

189
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:32,202
Well, that makes two of us. I'm in the charity
business as well. What can I do for you?

190
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:36,445
Actually, I'd like to talk about
doing an interview with you sometime,

191
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:40,685
concentrating on your views on youth. I've
heard a lot about them from my son Peter.

192
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:44,488
He's only 12, but your ideas
have made a big impression on him.

193
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:46,564
Excuse me.

194
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,883
The Israeli ambassador has to go.

195
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:57,089
Of course. I'd be pleased to talk to you.
Give Harvey a call. He'll arrange a time.

196
00:23:57,173 --> 00:24:01,291
- How about Sunday?
- Well, Sundays I usually spend with Peter.

197
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,570
Fine. Bring Peter along too. Excuse me.

198
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,927
Come on, you two! You'll get wet!

199
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,602
Mummy, look what Damien's given me!

200
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,332
- No, you can't.
- He can. He just did.

201
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,682
It's safer with him. If I have a collision,

202
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:54,243
we might have some sort of
international crisis on our hands.

203
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,563
I'm not sure you should spoil him so much.

204
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:59,531
Well, to tell you the truth,
he's been spoiling me.

205
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:02,889
It's not every day
you get the chance to be a boy again.

206
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,444
Well...

207
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,728
English weather.

208
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:13,731
- Go on, dog. Go and get it.
- Tell me about Peter's father.

209
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,088
He died just after Peter was born.

210
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:20,451
- Have you never thought of getting married?
- No. I'm too much of a skeptic.

211
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:24,685
- Oh, yes?
- Besides, I've never really had the time.

212
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,250
Peter's always wanted me to buy him a dog.

213
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,291
Well, you should.
Dogs and boys go great together.

214
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:36,331
We've had one of these dogs
in the family since I was a kid.

215
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:40,611
- They used to march with the Roman army.
- Did they?

216
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:43,082
They're as old as sin.

217
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:50,604
- Feel like some lunch?
- Good idea.

218
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:56,404
..probably realised my favourite subject
is me, not only because I'm very beautiful...

219
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:58,131
I am beautiful!

220
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:04,730
People from all over the world
came for our actors,

221
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,488
but where are the new ones gonna train
if we haven't got any stages?

222
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:13,044
And the reason we haven't got stages
is because people are not going to the theatre!

223
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,964
They are watching television.

224
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:19,968
You're sitting in a bar, and at 11 o'clock
they say "You have 10 minutes to drink up."

225
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:24,810
You've paid a fortune for that drink
and they throw you out in the streets.

226
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:30,251
"The day of Christ is at hand" wrote St Paul
in his second letter to the Thessalonians.

227
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,608
"Yet let no man be deceived,

228
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:37,084
for that day shall not come
until the man of sins is revealed,

229
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:40,563
the son of perdition, the Antichrist."

230
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,723
"And be not deceived by him,

231
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:47,728
for Satan himself is transformed
into an angel of light."

232
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:53,683
The hour of Christ's Second Coming draws
nigh. The prophecies fulfilled one by one.

233
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:58,289
Right now, my friends,
in the constellation of Cassiopeia,

234
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:03,652
a holy trinity of stars is converging
to herald our Lord's Second Coming.

235
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:08,853
"Rejoice, you heavens and you that dwell
in them" commands St John in Revelation.

236
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:13,529
"But woe to you, sea and earth, for the devil
hath come down to you in great fury,

237
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:18,209
knowing that his time is short,
and the Prince of Darkness shall be mighty."

238
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:21,410
"And he shall flourish
and destroy the mighty."

239
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:25,964
"And he shall cause craft
to prosper in his hands."

240
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:28,851
"And by peace shall he destroy many!"

241
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:36,288
I followed them through the crowd,
but couldn't get close enough.

242
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:39,206
He was with a woman and a boy of about 11.

243
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:43,969
- Who was the woman?
- She's a television interviewer.

244
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,849
I asked someone who went
up to her for an autograph.

245
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:52,411
Kate Reynolds.
She apparently is quite some celebrity.

246
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,927
- And the boy?
- Probably her son.

247
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:59,529
Please, Father, let it be me. Let me be
the bait to flush him out and destroy him.

248
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:05,051
- Thorn and I have made contact eye to eye.
- That is exactly why it cannot be you.

249
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:07,923
We have to strike him off guard.

250
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:12,962
Yet the target must be still...
for the marksman to be sure of his aim.

251
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,322
A sitting target...

252
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:21,530
- A sleeping target?
- No. His residence is guarded day and night.

253
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,730
- How about the embassy?
- Impossible.

254
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:28,642
There's our sitting target.

255
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:31,204
Where?

256
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:36,842
The Israeli government has denied
responsibility for the Aswan Dam disaster,

257
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:40,528
which has so far claimed
the lives ofover50,000 Egyptians,

258
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:45,084
though many fear that the final
death toll may reach twice that number.

259
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:49,564
Already typhoid has broken out among the
country's thousands of homeless refugees...

260
00:28:49,653 --> 00:28:54,090
- It's OK. I'll do it myself.
- ..and a major epidemic seems unavoidable.

261
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:58,564
The Egyptian government has revealed
that Thorn is supplying soya...

262
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:06,128
At the centre of Thorn’s global operations is
a man who has become a legend for his time:

263
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,169
Damien Thorn.

264
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:12,610
Did you see that woman?
It's not a woman. It's a guy. It's a faggot!

265
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:17,528
- Dressed up like a woman. It's a faggot!
- They're all God's children, Harvey.

266
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,770
..in a career that's already being compared
to that of the late John F Kennedy.

267
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:28,085
After majoring at Yale, Damien Thorn
came to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar,

268
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:32,724
where he captained the Oxford eight to
victory and won the Westchester Cup at polo.

269
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,692
In 1971 he took over
his uncle's business, Thorn industries,

270
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:40,925
and in seven years has turned it
into the world's largest multinational,

271
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:44,722
producing everything from nuclear
armaments to soya bean food products.

272
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:47,486
And now, at the age of 32,
Damien Thorn has...

273
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:49,564
Are you lost?

274
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:53,531
You're not connected
with this programme, are you?

275
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:56,685
- This is stage eight, isn't it?
- Four.

276
00:29:56,773 --> 00:30:00,686
- Studio eight's the next one along.
- Yes. Thank you.

277
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:05,925
A brilliant career
for one so young, Mr. Ambassador.

278
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:09,683
Not when you remember
that Alexander the Great

279
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:12,492
was commanding
the Macedonian army at 16.

280
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:17,488
Of course, that's how many people view you -
as a sort of 20th-century Alexander,

281
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:23,011
Leading the world out of the doldrums of
recession into the golden era of prosperity.

282
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:28,406
- You've seen too many of our commercials.
- But it is the image you put across.

283
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,884
Well, the image of Thorn as a corporation,
not a personal image of myself.

284
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:37,967
But yes, it's true. I certainly have
tremendous optimism for the future,

285
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:41,090
and I wanna see Thorn play
a major part in achieving it.

286
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,323
You have an interest in young people.

287
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:47,247
What are your plans as president
of the United Nations Youth Council?

288
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:51,804
A great many things, but I think
the most important task I have

289
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,966
is to help young people gain
a more prominent role in world affairs

290
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:59,841
than the one we currently
afford them, or rather deny them.

291
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:05,053
I mean, what is this arrogance that makes us
think that we know better than them?

292
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:09,843
We call them immature and naive. "Wait till
you're grown-up. Then we'll listen to you."

293
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:15,725
What we really mean is "Wait till you're
grown old. Then you'll think the way we do."

294
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:20,489
And so youth stands aside because
it has no other choice, and we set to work.

295
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:26,967
We ply them with our values,
we indoctrinate them with our mediocrity.

296
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:30,841
Until finally they emerge from
their brainwashing education

297
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:34,050
as so-called fully fledged citizens,

298
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:37,762
clipped, impotent, and above all safe.

299
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,849
Damien!

300
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:05,561
Grab one of these extinguishers! Come on!

301
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:46,844
God!

302
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:05,648
I need a drink.

303
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:09,645
I keep seeing that face.
How about you? You want one?

304
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:12,531
That was an assassination attempt.

305
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:16,128
What?

306
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,007
I found this on the studio floor.

307
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:27,609
This is one of the seven knives of Megiddo -
the only thing on earth that can kill me.

308
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:34,410
They were discovered in Israel
when I was a child.

309
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:40,568
An archaeologist, Bugenhagen, found them.
He gave them to my father to destroy me.

310
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:43,213
But I had the love of my true father
to protect me.

311
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:45,807
You said there were seven.
Where are the other six?

312
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,487
That's what we have to find out.

313
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:55,452
Someone must have dug them up
from the old Thorn Museum in Chicago.

314
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,730
And now they're in the hands
of someone who knows who I am.

315
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:02,010
And whoever knows who you are
must also know the prophecy.

316
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:05,847
Get hold of Buher right away. Tell him
to get to Chicago as soon as he can.

317
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:12,207
Excuse me, sir. The Harley Street Hospital
has just telephoned for Mr. Dean.

318
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:16,329
Barbara. I...
She went into labor this afternoon.

319
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:21,169
Can I borrow your car?

320
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:25,610
Call by the embassy first.
Get hold of Buher right away.

321
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,082
Are you OK, Damien?

322
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:42,883
"In a statement issued
from the American embassy,

323
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:47,364
Ambassador Thorn stated that he was
satisfied that there was no connection

324
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,968
between himself
and the unfortunate victim."

325
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:53,283
Thorn knows it was no accident.

326
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:58,488
Our priority now is to locate
the holy child as soon as he's born.

327
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:02,291
Brother Simeon and Brother Antonio,

328
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:08,005
I want you to make ready to come with me
tonight to ascertain his birthplace,

329
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:10,687
for the hour draws near.

330
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:15,051
The rest of you must wait until we return
before deciding how we proceed.

331
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:20,493
Our efforts must be
strictly coordinated next time.

332
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:23,292
We can't afford to make a second mistake.

333
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:38,131
- George.
- Yes, Mr. Ambassador?

334
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:42,923
- I won't be needing anything else tonight.
- Right you are, sir. Good night.

335
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,969
My father,

336
00:36:25,053 --> 00:36:28,841
Lord of silence, supreme god of desolation,

337
00:36:28,933 --> 00:36:32,926
who mankind reviles yet aches to embrace,

338
00:36:34,173 --> 00:36:40,328
strengthen my purpose to save the world
from a second ordeal of Jesus Christ

339
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:43,849
and his grubby, mundane creed.

340
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,727
2,000 years have been enough.

341
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:54,166
Show man instead
the raptures of thy kingdom.

342
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,563
Infuse in him the grandeur of melancholy,

343
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:00,247
the divinity of loneliness,

344
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,722
the purity of evil,

345
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:06,806
the paradise... of pain.

346
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:15,806
What perverted imagination has fed man the
lie that hell festers in the bowels of the earth?

347
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:19,852
There is only one hell -
the leaden monotony of human existence.

348
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:23,327
There is only one heaven.

349
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:27,966
The ecstasy of my father's kingdom.

350
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:38,369
Nazarene charlatan,
what can you offer humanity?

351
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:43,288
Since the hour you vomited forth
from the gaping wound of a woman,

352
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:46,763
you've done nothing
but drown man's soaring desires

353
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:50,129
in a deluge of sanctimonious morality.

354
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:57,044
You've inflamed the pubertal mind of youth
with your repellent dogma of original sin.

355
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:01,843
And now you're resolved on denying
him ultimate joy beyond death

356
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:04,322
by destroying me!

357
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:11,167
But you will fail, Nazarene.

358
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:14,807
As you have always failed.

359
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,205
We were both created in man's image.

360
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:27,402
But while you were born
of an impotent god,

361
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,049
I was conceived of a jackal.

362
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:37,008
Born of Satan, the desolate one,

363
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:40,284
the nail...

364
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:48,889
Your pain on the cross was but a splinter
compared to the agony of my father,

365
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,646
cast out from heaven,

366
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,769
the fallen angel,

367
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:56,765
banished, reviled...

368
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:06,006
I would drive deeper the thorns
into your rancid carcass,

369
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:09,210
you profaner of vices.

370
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,488
Cursed Nazarene.

371
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,364
Satan,

372
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:33,731
I will avenge thy torment

373
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:37,331
by destroying the Christ for ever.

374
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,573
Father De Carlo, welcome. Gentlemen.

375
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:31,884
The simulator has established
the approximate location

376
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:35,409
over which the three stars are to converge.

377
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:03,207
- How accurate is that?
- To about 50 square kilometers.

378
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:08,083
Once the alignment has taken place, we can
narrow it down to the nearest square metre.

379
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:31,206
Excuse me, sir. We're at T minus 500.

380
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:34,285
The final countdown is about to start.

381
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:42,324
There, gentlemen, are your three stars.

382
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:45,723
The waiting of 2,000 years... is at an end.

383
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:06,044
Mr. Ambassador!

384
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:12,006
Is there any connection between
the accident at the BBC and today's news?

385
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,812
- No.
- What about Schroeder's revelation

386
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:18,283
that the Israelis were responsible
for the Aswan Dam disaster?

387
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:22,844
- If it's true, it's a sad blow to world peace.
- Is that an official condemnation?

388
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,606
I condemn all violence,
but it's too early for that.

389
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:29,049
The Soviet Union's offered
support to Egypt for retaliation.

390
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:33,445
- How do you react to that?
- Gentlemen, I have nothing else to say.

391
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:39,522
Mr. Ambassador, I tried calling you
last night but there was no reply.

392
00:43:39,613 --> 00:43:42,969
Isn't there something we can do
to make up for what happened?

393
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,647
- Like what?
- Well, like...

394
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,804
- Like finishing the interview?
- Well, yes.

395
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,090
All right. But I'd sooner
we did it at my place than yours.

396
00:43:53,173 --> 00:43:56,768
Yours is a little... dramatic for my taste.

397
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:01,251
Why not stay on for dinner afterwards?

398
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:05,163
- I'd love to.
- All right. I'll have Harvey fix it.

399
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,244
Fine.

400
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:16,444
No, a boy.

401
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,842
Yeah, he sure is ugly.

402
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:20,764
Yeah.

403
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:24,048
All right. Thanks, Paul. Yeah.

404
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:26,244
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

405
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:31,285
That was Buher. He just sent over
the NLF report to the White House.

406
00:44:31,373 --> 00:44:34,490
He said it's so full of holes,
you can drive a truck through it.

407
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:37,326
Thanks for the flowers.
Barbara really appreciated...

408
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:39,290
And the daggers?

409
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:42,490
Apparently all seven came up
for auction a few months back.

410
00:44:42,573 --> 00:44:47,647
They were bought by a priest, and he passed
them on to a monastery in Italy - Subi...

411
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:50,691
Subiaco. The monastery of San Benedetto.

412
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:54,209
Yeah, Subiaco.
We've got our people in Italy working on it.

413
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:57,808
- Unless something happens, they should...
- It's too late.

414
00:44:57,893 --> 00:45:00,930
They're here in England
for the birth of the Nazarene.

415
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:05,249
Trying to destroy me before I destroy them.

416
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:13,171
He was born last night. I feel his presence.

417
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:17,407
Like a virus, a parasite,
feeding on my energy,

418
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:20,291
trying to drain me of power.

419
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:24,963
For every day that he lives and grows,

420
00:45:25,053 --> 00:45:27,647
my force will weaken.

421
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:33,611
Hide if you must, Nazarene,

422
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:37,002
but I will hunt you down.

423
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:50,649
- Why is he just sitting there?
- Waiting for me to follow him.

424
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:54,362
He must be an idiot if he thinks
you're gonna do something like that.

425
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:59,288
- He knows that's exactly what I intend to do.
- But what if he's got one of those daggers?

426
00:46:00,253 --> 00:46:02,892
I'll be wasting my time if he hasn't.

427
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,084
Matteus here. I'm 10 minutes away.

428
00:47:36,173 --> 00:47:39,609
Thorn's about... 500 yards behind me.

429
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,650
Enough!

430
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,724
Enough. It's done.

431
00:49:07,373 --> 00:49:11,002
But it was him! I saw him! I saw him!

432
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:14,847
- Sweet Saviour, spare our minds.
- We're possessed!

433
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:16,924
Spare our minds!

434
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,841
Down there! It's our only way out!

435
00:49:48,573 --> 00:49:51,645
- It's bricked up!
- It's closed here too.

436
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:53,884
There is no way out!

437
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:58,402
We're trapped!

438
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:26,326
There are still three daggers left.

439
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:31,009
But I can't afford to waste any more time.
The only way to be rid of the Nazarene

440
00:50:31,093 --> 00:50:35,291
is to kill every male child in the country
born between midnight and dawn

441
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:39,605
- on March 24th.
- How can we be sure he's in the country?

442
00:50:39,693 --> 00:50:43,925
"And he shall come forth out of the
angel isle." That's what the prophecy says.

443
00:50:44,013 --> 00:50:48,882
One thing pedantic Christians believe in
is sticking to the letter of their prophecies.

444
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:57,170
- How's Barbara?
- Fine.

445
00:50:57,253 --> 00:51:00,325
- And your son?
- Fine. He's fine.

446
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:03,689
He was born on March the 23rd, wasn't he?

447
00:51:04,253 --> 00:51:08,246
Yeah, yeah. Sure. He was born
10 minutes before midnight, March 23rd.

448
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,723
Whenever you're ready, Mr. Ambassador.

449
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,563
Liquidate the Nazarene.

450
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:18,042
Me? How?

451
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:21,925
That's what our people are for.

452
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:28,009
Now, call a meeting for Sunday.
I'll make my own way there after the hunt.

453
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:35,772
Chin up, old boy.

454
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:18,803
Thank you, my dear. I've been waiting
for this drink since the last meet.

455
00:52:40,573 --> 00:52:44,282
Stay close to Susan at the back,
and don't go showing off to Damien.

456
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:48,252
- Don't worry. You'll still get blooded.
- What does blooded mean?

457
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,483
You know perfectly well what it means.

458
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:55,203
If it's your first hunt and they catch a fox,
they smear blood all over your cheeks.

459
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:58,012
Satisfied?

460
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:02,004
Take care.

461
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:13,163
Well, Mr. Ambassador,
you've got the fastest horse in the hunt.

462
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,847
And it's a lovely morning for you.

463
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,724
OK, boys.

464
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:31,338
Take him.

465
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,650
Damien!

466
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:29,610
Damien, did you catch one?

467
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:33,937
The hounds didn't leave
too many souvenirs, but...

468
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:36,055
I saved some of the blood.

469
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,892
Can you blood me? Does it count?

470
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:41,647
It does with me.

471
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:09,333
Disciples of the watch,

472
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:15,452
I stand before you

473
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,690
in the name of the one true god,

474
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:24,653
who was cast out from heaven but is alive

475
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:26,730
in me.

476
01:01:27,459 --> 01:01:29,450
Do you hear me?

477
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:33,851
We hear and obey. We hear and obey.

478
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:37,648
I now command you

479
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:42,089
to seek out and destroy the Nazarene child.

480
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,488
Slay the Nazarene,

481
01:01:46,099 --> 01:01:48,738
and I shall reign for ever.

482
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:51,050
Fail,

483
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:54,289
and I perish.

484
01:01:55,259 --> 01:01:57,295
Slay the Nazarene,

485
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:01,215
and you, my disciples,

486
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:04,731
shall truly inherit this earth.

487
01:02:06,419 --> 01:02:08,410
Fail,

488
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:13,336
and you will perish without trace.

489
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,490
Slay the Nazarene,

490
01:02:18,059 --> 01:02:23,691
and you will know the violent raptures
of my father's kingdom.

491
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:27,373
Fail,

492
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:30,974
and you will be condemned
to a numbing eternity

493
01:02:31,059 --> 01:02:34,449
in the flaccid bosom of Christ.

494
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:36,575
Do you hear me?

495
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:38,775
We hear and obey.

496
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:42,373
Disciples of the watch,

497
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:46,571
there must be no delay.

498
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:50,493
Slay the Nazarene,

499
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:54,492
and the victory will be ours,

500
01:02:55,419 --> 01:03:00,288
now... and for ever more.

501
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:04,209
Do you hear me?

502
01:03:04,299 --> 01:03:06,096
We hear. We hear.

503
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,978
We're going for a walk now, aren't we?

504
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:36,448
With Auntie Carol, hey?

505
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:41,447
- Barbara!
- Hi. I'll be with you in just a minute.

506
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:44,372
There you go. All wrapped up.

507
01:03:44,859 --> 01:03:46,656
- Harvey!
- Yeah?

508
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,573
I'm just going shopping with Carol.
I'm gonna take Junior with me, OK?

509
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:53,935
Listen, don't forget to pick up
my stuff from the cleaner's.

510
01:03:54,019 --> 01:03:56,897
- No, I won't. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

511
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:39,374
Peterson? Harvey Dean.

512
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:43,293
I said "I'm not paying you that much.
You've only been here for two hours."

513
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,735
- What do you expect me to say?
- You've got such a nerve.

514
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:51,888
The Brookman family at 23 Ormsby Road,

515
01:04:51,979 --> 01:04:55,289
Sefton Park, Liverpool.

516
01:04:57,499 --> 01:05:02,892
Listen, Peterson, I don't give a shit
how you feel about this! Just do the job!

517
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:06,051
OK.

518
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:09,734
Now... Sefton Park, Liverpool.

519
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:12,572
And the boy's name is Christopher.

520
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,770
Kirkby Towers.

521
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:21,089
Kirkby 14.

522
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,693
Boy's name is Alexander David.

523
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:26,970
OK?

524
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:29,619
By Tuesday night.

525
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:31,690
Right.

526
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,651
Blake? Dean.

527
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:43,617
Why don't you and Harvey
come over for a meal?

528
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:46,213
Yeah. OK. That's nice.

529
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:48,290
I'll call you later. Bye.

530
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:57,133
We'll soon be home and you can have
something nice to eat. Are you hungry?

531
01:06:02,779 --> 01:06:05,054
Who's a good boy, then?

532
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:07,130
Can you hear me?

533
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:15,848
No!

534
01:06:20,859 --> 01:06:22,929
No!

535
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:37,172
- Name this child...
- Alexander David.

536
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:47,289
I baptise you Alexander David,

537
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:51,975
in the name of the Father and of the Son

538
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:54,768
and of the Holy Spirit.

539
01:06:55,459 --> 01:07:01,011
We receive this child into
the congregation of Christ's flock,

540
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:04,614
and sign him with the sign of the cross.

541
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:23,092
Morning, missis. We've come
to do our good deed for the day.

542
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:01,937
We're devoting the first part
of our programme

543
01:08:02,019 --> 01:08:07,298
to a disturbing phenomenon that's been
puzzling both doctors and police this week.

544
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:11,258
The mysterious deaths of numbers of babies
in the kind of circumstances

545
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:14,456
that coroners are fond
of terming "misadventure".

546
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:20,332
At the turn of the century, the infant mortality
rate stoodata staggering 34per cent.

547
01:08:20,419 --> 01:08:23,775
In 1945 it dropped to 16 per cent.

548
01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:28,774
And nowadays it's been cutback to under
two per cent. That is, until last week.

549
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:32,818
In Greater London, 17 babies
have died in the last seven days,

550
01:08:32,899 --> 01:08:37,370
with a further 14 deaths reported
from Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester,

551
01:08:37,459 --> 01:08:41,452
Leeds and Liverpool. These may
not sound unduly high figures,

552
01:08:41,539 --> 01:08:46,374
but nationwide they represent
a chilling 15 to 20 per cent increase

553
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:48,529
- in the mortality rate.
- Harvey...

554
01:08:48,619 --> 01:08:52,931
- Details are still sketchy at the moment.
- It's just a coincidence, that's all.

555
01:08:53,019 --> 01:08:58,377
..except one - in every case
the victim has been a baby boy.

556
01:08:58,459 --> 01:09:02,418
To throw further light on the subject,
I have with me Dr Richard Philmore

557
01:09:02,499 --> 01:09:05,411
from the Ministry of Health
and Social Security.

558
01:09:05,499 --> 01:09:09,412
- Tell me, what explanation do you have?
- Barbara?

559
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:12,373
It's too soon for us to make any statement,

560
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:15,417
but I’d like to correct you
on a point that you just made.

561
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:19,048
It really is quite inaccurate
to speak of a 20 per centrise

562
01:09:19,139 --> 01:09:22,176
in the infant mortality rate index.

563
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:27,970
Our statistics are based on annual averages
and not on weekly fluctuations.

564
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:33,008
But you admit there's been an unexplained
increase in the deaths among baby boys?

565
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:38,095
A rise, but nothing compared to the rise you'd
expect to find during, say, a flu epidemic.

566
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:41,489
Surely, Dr. Philmore,
we're not talking about a flu epidemic.

567
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:45,128
We're talking about
household burns, drownings,

568
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:48,928
car accidents, suffocation,
food poisonings, electrocution.

569
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:53,649
Scotland Yard has assured us that in their
opinion there is no question of foul play

570
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:57,652
in any of the mortalities reported.
Forgive me if I speak bluntly,

571
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:01,334
but your kind of scaremonger reporting
is the kind of behaviour

572
01:10:01,419 --> 01:10:03,649
that brings the media into bad repute.

573
01:10:06,379 --> 01:10:08,370
- Night, Miss Reynolds.
- Night, Bill.

574
01:10:53,259 --> 01:10:55,409
Miss Reynolds.

575
01:10:55,499 --> 01:10:57,535
I need to talk to you urgently.

576
01:10:57,619 --> 01:11:02,773
- It's about your programme about the deaths.
- A protest march of one. How disappointing.

577
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:07,610
On the contrary, I congratulate you
on your perceptiveness.

578
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:09,815
Well?

579
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,652
- May we go inside?
- I'm sorry...

580
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:15,970
- Father De Carlo.
- I've had a long day, Father.

581
01:11:16,059 --> 01:11:18,778
If you call my secretary,
she'll make an appointment.

582
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:22,010
I told you, I need to talk to you urgently.

583
01:11:24,059 --> 01:11:27,176
OK. But... please keep your voice down.

584
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:29,648
My son's asleep.

585
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:37,968
"Then Herod sent forth and slew
all the children that were in Bethlehem

586
01:11:38,059 --> 01:11:40,414
and in all the coasts thereof,

587
01:11:40,499 --> 01:11:44,253
according to the time of the birth of Jesus,

588
01:11:44,339 --> 01:11:47,217
which he had diligently
inquired of the wise men."

589
01:11:47,299 --> 01:11:49,938
What are you talking about?

590
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:53,728
You stated that the common factor
about these killings is

591
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:57,289
that all the victims have been baby boys.

592
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:00,494
But there is another common factor.

593
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:06,934
All the boys were born between midnight
and 6am on the morning of March 24th.

594
01:12:07,019 --> 01:12:11,615
Every child that's still living born
between those hours is in mortal danger,

595
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:15,931
- if he has not already been killed.
- Are you suggesting they've been murdered?

596
01:12:16,019 --> 01:12:19,489
No, no, I am not. I am stating it as a fact.

597
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:24,498
- Who on earth would do such a thing?
- He is born again, Miss Reynolds.

598
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:28,208
And so is the Antichrist. The son of Satan.

599
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:32,049
As foretold in the Book of Revelation.

600
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:37,819
I'm sorry, Father. Look, I do respect
your faith, but I don't share it.

601
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:42,536
- You are not a practising Christian?
- No, I'm a practising journalist.

602
01:12:42,619 --> 01:12:45,292
One rule of journalism
is to be a doubting Thomas.

603
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:49,372
I need to see evidence with my own two eyes.

604
01:12:49,459 --> 01:12:51,529
Right.

605
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:55,932
Here is your evidence.

606
01:12:56,019 --> 01:12:58,738
Check them for yourself.

607
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:06,095
Copies of the dead boys' birth certificates
from the central registry office.

608
01:13:07,379 --> 01:13:11,577
In every case, the child was born
on the morning of March 24th.

609
01:13:13,499 --> 01:13:17,856
Even if I can't appeal to your faith,
I appeal to your logic.

610
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:23,013
Why else would someone want to destroy
all children born on that date,

611
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:26,728
were it not in an effort
to destroy one child in particular?

612
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:31,847
That child is our blessed Saviour,
Jesus Christ, reborn.

613
01:13:33,099 --> 01:13:37,570
Thus fulfilling his promise that,
at the end of times,

614
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:42,210
he shall come again to deliver
the world from the Antichrist.

615
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:45,336
And who exactly is this... Antichrist?

616
01:13:45,699 --> 01:13:48,816
The American ambassador, Damien Thorn.

617
01:13:49,939 --> 01:13:52,737
That's ridiculous! I know Damien Thorn.

618
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:56,370
You may know the man.
Do you know his soul?

619
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:59,337
Miss Reynolds,
I am a religious man, not a fanatic.

620
01:13:59,659 --> 01:14:02,776
One of the commandments of my faith is

621
01:14:02,859 --> 01:14:07,455
that we shall not
bear false witness against any man.

622
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:10,815
If I had one shred of doubt
about Damien Thorn,

623
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:14,255
my faith would command me
to remain silent.

624
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:17,297
But I've watched him now for 27 years,

625
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:22,768
ever since his father came to our monastery
to seek help in destroying him.

626
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:26,488
I've watched him grow from a boy into a man,

627
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:30,936
seen him exterminate
all those who stood in his way.

628
01:14:33,019 --> 01:14:36,375
Very well. You know Thorn, the man.

629
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:44,011
I'll leave you with our research on him.

630
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:48,650
But you must satisfy yourself
before reaching your opinion.

631
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:55,611
And when you have done so, I would urge
that you contact me as soon as possible,

632
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,054
at this address.

633
01:14:59,899 --> 01:15:02,174
Here.

634
01:15:02,259 --> 01:15:04,727
Day or night.

635
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:07,732
I...

636
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:10,891
I can't promise you anything, Father.

637
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:15,609
You say I know only Thorn, the man -
not his soul.

638
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:19,931
But if I don't even know my own soul,
how can I see into his?

639
01:15:20,019 --> 01:15:22,010
Only God can show you that.

640
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:29,489
There is, however, one sign
that identifies him as the Antichrist.

641
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:33,777
You will find it
in the Book of Revelation, as I told you.

642
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:37,728
You will also find it on Thorn himself.

643
01:15:39,259 --> 01:15:41,648
Under his hair.

644
01:15:42,619 --> 01:15:44,610
Here.

645
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:47,293
The birthmark of the devil.

646
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:51,369
6... 6... 6.

647
01:15:58,939 --> 01:16:02,409
I'll let myself out. Good night, Miss Reynolds.

648
01:16:03,419 --> 01:16:07,048
And may God guide your decision.

649
01:16:44,779 --> 01:16:47,088
The Israelis are onto Schroeder.

650
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:52,014
We've got to eliminate him - now!
Before they have a chance to make him talk.

651
01:16:52,099 --> 01:16:54,897
Then do it.

652
01:16:54,979 --> 01:16:59,530
But we can't get close to him.
They've got him in Tel Aviv.

653
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:03,931
- Damien, you're the only one that can do it.
- You can handle it.

654
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:07,534
- I just told you. We can't get...
- And I told you

655
01:17:09,139 --> 01:17:13,655
that every day the Nazarene lives,
my force would weaken.

656
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:16,936
- Now, how many boys are left?
- Three or four.

657
01:17:17,019 --> 01:17:20,295
- Including your son?
- Now, wait a minute.

658
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:23,212
I've already told you,
he was born March 23rd.

659
01:17:23,299 --> 01:17:27,338
- Now you gotta believe me.
- I'll believe you when the Nazarene is dead.

660
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:33,297
Yes?

661
01:17:33,379 --> 01:17:34,971
Who is this?

662
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:40,332
It's Kate Reynolds' son.
He's calling from a coin box.

663
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:44,488
- But how'd he get this number?
- I gave it to him.

664
01:17:50,259 --> 01:17:52,250
Hello, Peter?

665
01:17:54,139 --> 01:17:59,008
Good. Now, listen carefully.
I want you to follow him wherever he goes,

666
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:01,932
and make sure he doesn't see you, OK?

667
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,012
Yeah, and call me as soon as you find out.

668
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:09,010
All right.

669
01:18:10,539 --> 01:18:15,613
Be careful, Damien. His mother
was on the phone earlier this morning.

670
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:18,611
- She wants to see you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

671
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:22,209
- I wanna talk to her.
- Because she's dangerous.

672
01:18:22,299 --> 01:18:26,497
I decide who's dangerous and who isn't.
Now, get her on the phone,

673
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:29,571
and tell her I wanna see her
tomorrow at the house.

674
01:18:29,659 --> 01:18:31,775
And don't mention Peter.

675
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:53,817
Hi, honey! I'm home!

676
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,128
What are you doing in here?

677
01:20:05,019 --> 01:20:07,613
Don't you come anywhere near him,
you murderer!

678
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:10,497
Murderer? What are you talking about?

679
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:13,571
You lay one finger on him,
and I'll butcher you,

680
01:20:13,659 --> 01:20:16,731
just like you've butchered
all these other children.

681
01:20:16,819 --> 01:20:22,496
A priest came by today. He came to warn me
that Damien Thorn is the Antichrist,

682
01:20:22,579 --> 01:20:28,336
and he'll murder my baby, like he's killed
these others that were born on the same day.

683
01:20:28,419 --> 01:20:31,331
- You believe some religious maniac?
- No!

684
01:20:31,419 --> 01:20:33,853
I found the proof myself!

685
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:36,809
You don't know what you've done.

686
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:47,776
I once hosted a programme,
And Now For The Good News,

687
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:51,010
- which won an RTA award.
- Really?

688
01:20:51,099 --> 01:20:53,852
For the lowest audience
viewing figure of the year.

689
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:58,854
Yet now I'm reporting death and destruction,
and my show's gone to the top of the ratings.

690
01:20:58,939 --> 01:21:03,137
- Everyone loves a mystery.
- I think it goes deeper than that.

691
01:21:03,219 --> 01:21:07,895
We might aspire after good,
but our real fascination lies with evil.

692
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:10,891
- Don't you agree?
- Not really.

693
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:15,894
Most people confuse evil with
their own trivial lusts and perversions.

694
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:19,096
Now, true evil is as pure as innocence.

695
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:22,288
Then what is evil?

696
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:24,370
Come on.

697
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:31,577
- I'll show you where Old Nick hangs out.
- Old who?

698
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:33,650
Old Nick.

699
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:43,767
He's down there somewhere,
lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce.

700
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:46,498
He must be at least 40 by now.

701
01:21:46,579 --> 01:21:49,377
We first met when I was about four.

702
01:21:50,099 --> 01:21:52,567
We've been old friends ever since.

703
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:55,378
You know Old Nick is the name
for the devil in England?

704
01:21:55,459 --> 01:21:59,418
Of course I know.
But it's a great name for a pike.

705
01:22:01,339 --> 01:22:04,137
Do you believe in God?

706
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:09,537
I think you know the answer
to that question already.

707
01:22:12,939 --> 01:22:15,214
- Look, there it goes!
- Where?

708
01:22:15,299 --> 01:22:17,494
Down there.

709
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:24,770
Damien! Help me!

710
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:29,735
Damien! I can't...

711
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:33,650
Help me!

712
01:23:02,859 --> 01:23:04,850
Well, that should fit you.

713
01:23:10,139 --> 01:23:12,937
I feel like a moth

714
01:23:14,019 --> 01:23:17,409
that's flown too close to the flame.

715
01:23:19,419 --> 01:23:21,808
But who is the moth,

716
01:23:22,419 --> 01:23:25,013
and who's the flame?

717
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,610
Don't stop, Damien.

718
01:23:39,419 --> 01:23:41,569
Don't stop.

719
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:43,650
Please don't stop.

720
01:23:46,579 --> 01:23:50,572
What's the matter? What's the matter?

721
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:02,088
You wanna see what I see?

722
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:05,568
I want you, Damien.

723
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:19,497
You're hurting me.

724
01:24:19,579 --> 01:24:22,537
Birth is pain. Death is pain.

725
01:24:22,619 --> 01:24:24,769
Beauty is pain.

726
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:13,010
Damien?

727
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:43,015
- Was Schroeder on the Thorn payola or not?
- No statement.

728
01:28:43,099 --> 01:28:46,648
- Can't we talk to Ambassador Thorn?
- The ambassador is unavailable.

729
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,969
- He's not even here.
- Where is he?

730
01:28:49,059 --> 01:28:52,938
When he is ready to make a statement,
we will let you know.

731
01:29:00,659 --> 01:29:03,935
Damien, I thought you were up at the house.

732
01:29:04,019 --> 01:29:06,613
The press are goin' crazy for a statement.

733
01:29:06,699 --> 01:29:10,328
I can hold 'em off until I've talked to Buher,
but you're gonna have to...

734
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:13,217
What was De Carlo doing
at your house yesterday?

735
01:29:13,299 --> 01:29:15,608
Who?

736
01:29:16,379 --> 01:29:19,132
Now, come on, Dean. Just give me the truth.

737
01:29:20,259 --> 01:29:25,538
I'm telling the truth. I've never
heard of De Carlo before in my life.

738
01:29:25,619 --> 01:29:27,610
Peter.

739
01:29:35,099 --> 01:29:39,331
- Go ahead, Peter.
- "At half past three yesterday afternoon,

740
01:29:39,419 --> 01:29:43,537
I saw the priest called De Carlo
go to 144 Abbey Crescent,

741
01:29:43,619 --> 01:29:47,817
where he spent an hour and 22 minutes
talking to the wife of Mr. Dean."

742
01:29:50,659 --> 01:29:52,650
Damien... Look, l...

743
01:29:54,179 --> 01:29:56,215
I didn't know he was a priest.

744
01:29:56,299 --> 01:29:59,018
- I didn't know Barbara would...
- Kill your son!

745
01:29:59,739 --> 01:30:01,138
What?!

746
01:30:01,499 --> 01:30:06,971
There's only one boy left, and that's your son.
Destroy him... or be destroyed.

747
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,849
Damien, for the love of God!

748
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:12,737
"And God said unto Abraham:

749
01:30:13,819 --> 01:30:17,448
Take now thy son, thine only Isaac,

750
01:30:17,539 --> 01:30:22,135
whom thou lovest,
and offer him for a burnt offering."

751
01:30:24,579 --> 01:30:29,972
Now, if Abraham was willing to slay
his own son for the love of his god,

752
01:30:30,059 --> 01:30:34,177
- why won't you do the same for mine?
- You're all crazy.

753
01:30:35,019 --> 01:30:37,010
Crazy.

754
01:30:42,259 --> 01:30:44,932
Aren't you gonna stop him?

755
01:30:45,019 --> 01:30:47,772
There's no need.

756
01:31:21,259 --> 01:31:23,136
Go on! Go away!

757
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:25,210
Go on!

758
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:30,649
There, now. It's OK, honey. He...

759
01:32:11,419 --> 01:32:14,411
Barbara! Start packing!

760
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,290
Barbara?

761
01:32:58,859 --> 01:33:03,694
Ten o'clock, Miss Reynolds.
Locking up in five minutes.

762
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:05,770
Coming.

763
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:10,730
Miss Reynolds.

764
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:16,011
- What are you doing here?
- You saw him, didn't you?

765
01:33:16,099 --> 01:33:20,012
You know Thorn is the Antichrist,
so why are you protecting him?

766
01:33:20,979 --> 01:33:24,574
Either you get out of here or I'll call security.

767
01:33:25,979 --> 01:33:28,573
Your son... Where is he?

768
01:33:28,899 --> 01:33:33,336
- He's in bed and asleep, of course.
- He is not.

769
01:33:33,419 --> 01:33:35,649
Your son is with Damien Thorn.

770
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:43,217
In body and soul. Your son has become
an apostle of the Antichrist.

771
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:47,336
You think Peter's been at school
for the past three days?

772
01:33:47,419 --> 01:33:50,092
Check with the school
if you don't believe me.

773
01:33:50,179 --> 01:33:55,094
He's been working for Thorn,
conspiring to murder the holy child.

774
01:33:56,499 --> 01:33:59,218
They won't succeed.

775
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:04,451
The holy child is beyond
his powers now. He's safe.

776
01:34:04,539 --> 01:34:09,852
But your child is not. There is only
one way to save your son, Miss Reynolds.

777
01:34:10,299 --> 01:34:14,212
And that's by destroying the Antichrist.

778
01:34:14,299 --> 01:34:18,212
- Are you asking me...?
- No. No, Miss Reynolds.

779
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:21,972
That is to be my sacred task.

780
01:34:22,059 --> 01:34:27,008
But if you value your son's immortal soul,
you must help me to carry it out.

781
01:34:27,499 --> 01:34:30,172
Hurry along, Miss Reynolds.
We're locking up.

782
01:34:30,259 --> 01:34:32,250
I'll be out in a moment.

783
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:40,010
- I'm going home to my son.
- Then I beg you to let me come with you.

784
01:34:40,099 --> 01:34:43,728
There will be no time to lose
when you find he's not there.

785
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:45,810
Please.

786
01:34:59,699 --> 01:35:02,975
You think you've won, do you?

787
01:35:03,059 --> 01:35:08,452
You watched me slay a hundred children
and never lifted a finger to save them.

788
01:35:09,499 --> 01:35:15,131
"Suffer the little children to come unto me."
Your words, Nazarene, not mine.

789
01:35:19,779 --> 01:35:22,976
Oh, Satan, the victory is thine.

790
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:28,769
All praise to thee, for thou hast
delivered this child unto me

791
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:32,329
that I maybe brought
face to face with the Nazarene

792
01:35:32,419 --> 01:35:34,694
at last.

793
01:35:34,779 --> 01:35:38,692
Now, Peter, listen to me and listen carefully.

794
01:35:38,779 --> 01:35:42,374
The Christian faith has ten commandments.
I have only one.

795
01:35:42,459 --> 01:35:46,088
Say it now and we two shall become as one.

796
01:35:47,499 --> 01:35:50,059
- I love you.
- Beyond all others.

797
01:35:50,139 --> 01:35:53,017
- Beyond all others.
- Beyond life itself.

798
01:35:53,099 --> 01:35:55,090
No, Peter. Don't say it.

799
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:00,452
Give me back my son

800
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:04,009
- and I will lead you to the Christ child.
- Where is he?

801
01:36:04,099 --> 01:36:07,774
Give me back Peter first
and I'll take you to him.

802
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:14,412
Very well. You shall lead us both to
the Nazarene, and then Peter shall be yours.

803
01:36:14,499 --> 01:36:18,970
- No, Damien! It's a trick!
- Not if she wants her son back, it isn't.

804
01:36:19,579 --> 01:36:21,570
All right.

805
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:36,535
If you can help me,

806
01:36:36,619 --> 01:36:38,610
help me now.

807
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:26,610
No!

808
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:29,770
Peter!

809
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:35,768
Peter? Peter, dearest!

810
01:37:37,459 --> 01:37:40,849
- No.
- Where is your god now, priest?

811
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:54,612
I'm here, Nazarene!

812
01:37:54,699 --> 01:37:56,690
Where are you?

813
01:37:57,619 --> 01:37:59,610
You hear me?

814
01:38:02,499 --> 01:38:04,490
Face me!

815
01:38:05,459 --> 01:38:07,654
Face me!

816
01:38:11,099 --> 01:38:13,169
It's time!

817
01:38:24,979 --> 01:38:27,368
Show yourself!

818
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:36,088
I know you're here!

819
01:38:36,739 --> 01:38:39,936
Come out and face me!

820
01:39:08,939 --> 01:39:11,533
You bastard!

821
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:10,690
Nazarene...

822
01:40:11,659 --> 01:40:13,729
You have won...

823
01:40:13,819 --> 01:40:16,049
nothing.
