1
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:26,153
I love you, Billy.

2
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:44,408
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:52,254
Damn it, Billy. I think you broke my jaw.

4
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:55,226
You fucking deserve it, you assholes!

5
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:56,861
- Oh, are you okay, baby?
- No.

6
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,724
Get the fuck out of here!

7
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:01,024
What the hell are you doing
dressed like that?

8
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,690
For the Mountain Man Festival,
thought we'd dress up.

9
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,700
Yeah, where are your costumes?

10
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,270
- What?
- We don't have any.

11
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,340
You can't go without a costume.
It shows lack of commitment.

12
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,410
Can we have this conversation
after I can get dressed?

13
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:15,512
Okay. Okay.

14
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:17,310
Nice, Billy.

15
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:20,383
Nice. Assholes.

16
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:26,187
This is Kaleen Webber,
reporting from the small town of Fairlake...

17
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:29,122
...which, once a year,
turns into a big town on Halloween...

18
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,263
...due to the 10th annual
Mountain Man Music Festival.

19
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,059
People from all over the country
descend upon Fairlake...

20
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:39,602
...for a weekend of music, partying and fun
at the fairgrounds just outside town.

21
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,672
The festival has grown over the years
to where it now rivals...

22
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,741
...Coachella and Lollapalooza.

23
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,846
But some say that its free spirit and rowdy
crowds reminds them of Burning Man...

24
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,448
...which has local officials concerned
on this night.

25
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:54,477
Now back to you at the studio.

26
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,177
- Great.
- Here's the deal.

27
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,982
I'm going for a run
to get my head out of this small-town crap.

28
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:01,387
I'll meet you here for the live feed at 11.

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,653
And everything better be ready to go.

30
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,661
Go away, kid.

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,936
Hurry up. We gotta get on the road.
I don't wanna be late.

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,169
All right,
give me a minute to get up first.

33
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,109
We heard you're the one-minute man.

34
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,842
No. I assure you he has no problems
in that department.

35
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,953
All right. I'm starving.
I gotta make breakfast first.

36
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,922
- Come on, Billy.
- Well, you gotta start your day out right.

37
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:57,274
Nice costume, creep.

38
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,982
You know what? I'm sick of this.

39
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:11,622
I'm sick of you kids partying,
making a mess and trying to scare people.

40
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,924
Well, you know what?
You don't scare me.

41
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,966
So fuck you. Go home.

42
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,841
Help me! Help me, please!
Somebody help me!

43
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,606
Hey, hey. Over here.

44
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:33,114
Oh, please help. They're chasing me.

45
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,583
Follow me. This way.

46
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,452
Down here.

47
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:07,510
Okay.

48
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:09,876
Okay, I think they've gone.

49
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:13,455
Thank you.
You saved me from those maniacs.

50
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,287
Hey, you're bleeding pretty badly there.

51
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:17,985
Let me fix that for you.

52
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:20,427
Thank God for you.

53
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,096
Yeah. Thank God for me.

54
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,264
Now, you keep pressure on that.

55
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,271
- You stay here.
- Okay.

56
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:32,535
I'm gonna make sure they've gone.

57
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,807
- Okay, it's all clear. This way.
- Okay.

58
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,454
Okay, okay, okay.

59
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:46,985
But there's....

60
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:50,093
- There's just one thing I forgot.
- What?

61
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,495
This.

62
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,126
Hey, give me a hand, will you?

63
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,600
No, you fucking idiot.

64
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,398
The body.

65
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,975
Jesus fucking Christ.

66
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:07,632
- Wake and bake, brother.
- Thanks.

67
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:10,869
You're such a slob.

68
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,670
Can you try
and be a little bit cleaner for me?

69
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:15,972
- What?
- You look like a pig.

70
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:17,307
All right. Check it out.

71
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:20,474
I got all our party favors arranged
by date and time.

72
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,054
So this is cutting into my overhead.

73
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:28,090
But in honor of this weekend and Julian's
great idea for us to come out here...

74
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,851
...I've made an exception.

75
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:33,429
First up, some chronic,
which you're participating in.

76
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,228
And then some x
for when we go trick or treating...

77
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:41,099
...and some shrooms
for when the bands start playing.

78
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,001
You've been out of school
for two semesters.

79
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:47,235
- What do your parents think?
- Oh, no. They don't know shit.

80
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:49,744
And I wanna keep it that way.

81
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:53,907
Besides, you know,
I'm a budding entrepreneur.

82
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:56,417
Why did we have to come
all the way out here?

83
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,957
Because it's Mountain Man, baby.

84
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:03,594
Hey, come on, look,
we could have gone to Burning Man.

85
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,697
But I'm not gonna drive
all the way across country.

86
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,662
We got a homegrown version of it here.

87
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,428
Yeah. Mountain Man has got a much more
interesting story to it, anyway.

88
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:16,296
- You know the story, Cruz?
- I'm not from around here, remember?

89
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:19,307
Okay, well, we're going
to a small town called Fairlake.

90
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:22,207
It was founded in 1814
or some shit like that.

91
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,714
Well, apparently, the local miners didn't get
along too well with the hill people.

92
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:28,785
I guess it was a territory dispute.

93
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:31,251
There was conflicts
over the next couple of years.

94
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:36,656
Now, Halloween night, 1817...

95
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,194
...the entire town
was ravaged by hillbillies...

96
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:42,731
...in the largest massacre
in the state's history.

97
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,969
The only problem
was no bodies were found.

98
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:48,128
It was just-- Just blood. Lots of it.
It was-- You know, it--

99
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:52,402
The entire town,
every inhabitant disappeared.

100
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,038
Was never seen again.

101
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:58,741
- That's awful.
- Well....

102
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:03,183
Legend has it, the hillbillies hauled
all the bodies up to the woods...

103
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:08,690
...created a huge bonfire and then
they cooked the fair residents of Fairlake.

104
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:12,957
Well-- And then they ate them.

105
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:24,040
- Okay, you know what? I don't wanna go.
- Oh, come on, baby, we're almost there.

106
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:27,372
No. I don't wanna celebrate a massacre.

107
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:29,103
- It's innocent fun.
- It's wrong.

108
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,272
We'll just go tonight, we'll leave tomorrow,
okay? Come on, Cruz.

109
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,008
Just one night, huh?

110
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,846
Please?

111
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:40,682
Okay, fine.

112
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,884
It is fine.

113
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,543
What the fuck is all this shit?

114
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:44,381
What have I told you about this?

115
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,791
I told you a thousand fucking times...

116
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,159
...you never leave anything behind.

117
00:10:54,332 --> 00:11:00,293
You never ever leave anything behind!

118
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,807
What if somebody found this, huh?

119
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:08,378
Then you got cops investigating,
snooping around.

120
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:12,710
You don't live in some goddamn hospital
in the middle of nowhere anymore.

121
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:17,446
You live closer to civilization,
a lot fucking closer!

122
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:22,149
I have been doing this for 30 years...

123
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:25,157
...and I have never had to move.

124
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:28,095
Do you know why?

125
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:33,101
Because I never leave shit behind!

126
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:37,598
I swear to fucking God,
you three pinheads...

127
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:41,403
...you'd all be under lock and key by now
if I hadn't of happened across you.

128
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:52,149
You live in my fucking house now
and you play by my fucking rules.

129
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:54,814
You do as I say...

130
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,027
...or I swear to God,
I will take you all down, kin or no kin.

131
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,692
Get her processed.

132
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,339
- Looking forward to the trip?
- Yeah.

133
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:19,915
Thinking about getting me
a new .30-06 for the occasion.

134
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:22,552
It was lucky of Jason
to win the bear license lottery.

135
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,517
I know. He's very excited.

136
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,523
- Well, he's a good guy to invite me along.
- I know. That's why I married him.

137
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:31,890
- You sure you don't wanna come?
- I've got ajob to do.

138
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,826
You need to learn to relax a bit.

139
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:37,798
You're always so by-the-book.
You ride us like we're in the military.

140
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:40,460
Discipline, Junior,
it's a good tool to use in life.

141
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,705
Ready for tonight?

142
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,747
Mob of kids, such a pain in the keister.

143
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,510
It should be a big night
for drunk and disorderly.

144
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,245
Sheriff Carter.

145
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:01,449
Who is the sexiest sheriff
in all of Greenbrier County?

146
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:04,151
I'm the only sheriff in Greenbrier County.

147
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:05,956
Still doesn't mean you're not sexy.

148
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,758
Hey, I just blew off the second shift.
I'm headed home.

149
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,696
That's good.

150
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:13,898
Junior's buying a new rifle
for your hunt this weekend.

151
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,540
Tell him it won't make him a better shot.

152
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,202
Yeah, I aIready did.

153
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,504
L'm gonna fix some lasagna tonight
for dinner.

154
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,080
- I'll stop by and bring you some?
- That would be great.

155
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,240
But call first. It's gonna be a busy night.

156
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,352
L may head down to the fairgrounds.

157
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,181
Then I'll bring it to you there.

158
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,948
I'll call you Iater. Bye, honey.

159
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,058
Okay, bye, honey.

160
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,596
Gotta turn this up.

161
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,898
There's supposed to be
about 20 bands there.

162
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:51,633
- Oh, who's playing?
- The Cheetah Whores.

163
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:53,037
Oh, who are they?

164
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:55,543
- An all-girI band. Freaking awesome.
- Yeah.

165
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:57,010
Gus' favorite band.

166
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,547
If they're so awesome,
why haven't I heard of them?

167
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,981
You're from the West Coast.
They don't play there.

168
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:04,280
- When are you gonna go back, by the way?
- June.

169
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,286
But just for a month to see my parents.

170
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:08,516
- Billy is coming with me.
- Yeah.

171
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:11,856
- Nice.
- We are gonna have an epic time.

172
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,293
Meeting the foIks?
That's getting pretty serious.

173
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:17,798
Who? Me? Serious? Never.

174
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,800
Look out!

175
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,647
Is everyone okay?

176
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,515
Is anybody hurt?

177
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:40,657
- I'm all right.
- No, we're okay.

178
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,258
Oh, shit.

179
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,829
Where did he come from?

180
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,360
Did we hit him?

181
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,662
I'm not sure.

182
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,834
Well, we should see if he's dead.

183
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,646
You guys, stay here.

184
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,210
Goddamn it.

185
00:15:08,386 --> 00:15:10,513
I didn't see him in the rain.

186
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,662
- Yeah, I think he's dead.
- But I didn't hit him.

187
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,360
You must have.

188
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,894
Hey.

189
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,205
Fuck you.

190
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,365
You trying to fuck with us?

191
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,807
- Get up.
- You piece of shit.

192
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:47,817
- Freeze.
- Put your hands on your head.

193
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,256
- He stabbed me.
- Put your hands on your head now!

194
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:51,895
Don't you move.

195
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,089
- Turn around and walk towards me.
- Shit.

196
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,665
Slowly.

197
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,495
Go!

198
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,799
I want everyone to wait together
by your vehicIe. Biggs?

199
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:05,033
I've got them, sheriff.

200
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:09,940
Don't you move.

201
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,609
Face down on the ground.

202
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,352
Right hand behind your back.

203
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:22,449
Left hand.

204
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,561
Turn around.

205
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:43,108
I need a wagon.
Route 96, mile marker 30.

206
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:46,148
- Copy that. On its way.
- Great, thanks.

207
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:01,961
Hey, sheriff.

208
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:06,135
It Iooks like we've got
an entire pharmacy here.

209
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:08,898
And the festivaI hasn't even started yet.

210
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,303
It's gonna be a long night.

211
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,743
Junior, can you stay with the car
until the tow truck arrives?

212
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:17,506
UntiI we get a search?
I don't wanna mess up evidence.

213
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,944
Sure thing, boss.

214
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:47,568
What the fuck?

215
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,613
Hey.

216
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:53,044
Hold it right there.

217
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:55,379
Shit!

218
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,596
Hey.

219
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,606
That should do it.

220
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:56,340
You need to have those stitches
removed in about three weeks.

221
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:57,981
Thank you.

222
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,316
All done here, sheriff.

223
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:24,938
- Thanks for coming, Rick.
- That's all right.

224
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:28,203
I know how busy it's gonna get
for you tonight.

225
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,903
- Goodbye.
- Good night.

226
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,979
You know, I just don't know
what I'm gonna do.

227
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:40,146
If I get charged, they're gonna take
my schoIarship away from me.

228
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:43,293
- We can get kicked out of schooI.
- Billy, you gotta tell her.

229
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:46,521
- It was your drugs, not ours.
- No, no. If he cIaims it's all his...

230
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:49,598
- ...they couId throw the book at him.
- I don't care.

231
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,564
I'm sitting in jaiI because of him.

232
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:58,271
- I just don't know what I'm gonna do.
- All right, hey, don't worry, all right?

233
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,777
I got this.

234
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:05,241
Sheriff, can I speak with you a moment?

235
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,474
What is it?

236
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,642
The drugs are mine.
My friends had nothing to do with it.

237
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,946
That's to be determined.

238
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:13,283
HonestIy, they're mine. They'll tell you.

239
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:14,617
He's right.

240
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:18,754
PIease let them go.
I'll take responsibiIity.

241
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,264
All right. I'm gonna need space tonight,
anyway.

242
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:34,539
Don't leave town.

243
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,646
We won't go anywhere.

244
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:39,180
There's a moteI at the end of the street.

245
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:52,061
- Thanks.
- You can get your things.

246
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:09,110
We'll bring you back some dinner, Billy.

247
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,171
Thanks.

248
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:17,986
Hey, what about me?

249
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,147
You saw how they attacked me.
Why am I being heId?

250
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:22,923
AssauIt with a deadIy weapon.

251
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:27,395
- That's bullshit.
- The cut on the boy's arm says otherwise.

252
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:30,033
Well, would you at Ieast move me
to another cell?

253
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,567
This drunk stinks.

254
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:33,896
You'll survive.

255
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:42,345
- Where is she?
- I've been calling her cell for the Iast hour.

256
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:44,845
- She's not picking up.
- Freaking diva.

257
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:47,074
I hate taIent.

258
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,810
You're gonna have to fill in.

259
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:51,314
What?

260
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,251
No, I can't.

261
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:55,915
You can and you will.

262
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:58,254
No one goes to dead air on my watch.

263
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,489
Okay.

264
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:07,063
Here we are on Main Street
in the town of FairIake, West Virginia.

265
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,832
The kids are out for Halloween
in full force...

266
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:12,567
...but they're joined
by a bunch of hillbillies...

267
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:15,211
...for the 10th annuaI
Mountain Man Music FestivaI.

268
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:19,247
So whether you're dressed as a ghost
or a witch or a hillbilly...

269
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,611
...everyone is sure
to have a happy Halloween...

270
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:24,413
...with some great music to top it all off.

271
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,055
That's all for now.

272
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:29,158
I'm Virginia Kelly from Live Action News.

273
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,761
Good job.

274
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,298
- Is this it?
- Oh, 3, this is it.

275
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,601
It Iooks all right.

276
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,074
- Nice.
- This is our bed, Gus.

277
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:58,679
Seems like you've been running
for quite some time.

278
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:01,919
Well, your running just ended.

279
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,422
There is no statute of Iimitations
for murder.

280
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:12,458
You have no idea
what you've gotten yourself into, do you?

281
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:16,106
A Iot of paperwork, I suspect.

282
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:25,376
U.S. Marshals'office.

283
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:28,279
Yeah, this is Sheriff Carter in FairIake.

284
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,886
I have a fugitive for you.

285
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:33,282
He's been on the run for 30 years.

286
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:37,251
- What's his name?
- Maynard Odets.

287
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:40,522
Case number 316165.

288
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:42,723
We can have transport there by 10 a.m.

289
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,925
Yeah, that will be fine.

290
00:23:46,837 --> 00:23:49,772
The marshaIs will be here
to pick you up in the morning.

291
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:52,574
You won't Iive that long.

292
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,378
I highIy doubt that.

293
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:06,582
No, I-- No, I know. I know.

294
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:10,853
No, it's--
Yeah, but it was a complete accident.

295
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:13,019
It was an a-- Yeah.

296
00:24:13,197 --> 00:24:14,789
Tomorrow.

297
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:16,091
The car is totaIed.

298
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:41,751
No, I sent the other deputies
to the fairgrounds to poIice the festivaI.

299
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:43,916
All except Junior.

300
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:46,919
Which reminds me,
he should be back by now.

301
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,698
Jason?

302
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,596
Jason?

303
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:56,637
Mr. Brodin?

304
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,782
Mr. Brodin.... Lost the signaI.
ProbabIy for the best.

305
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:13,923
To say Billy's dad is pissed
is the understatement of the year.

306
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:17,558
- Is he coming tomorrow?
- Yeah.

307
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,628
How much troubIe
do you think Billy's in?

308
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:22,231
Oh, God, there's a Iot of drugs
in that bag.

309
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,459
I don't think he's gonna get off
with a misdemeanor.

310
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,933
Do you think Billy's gonna go to jaiI?

311
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:31,666
Billy's dad will throw the best Iawyers at it
because Billy's dad is Ioaded.

312
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:35,801
- He might not have to. He might get Iucky.
- Yeah. I wouldn't worry about it.

313
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,879
Billy's dad's connected up to the wazoo.

314
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,643
Okay, so let's go to the festivaI.

315
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,583
What the hell, Julian? We can't go now.

316
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:48,384
Well, we can't help Billy
sitting in a hotel room. Why not? We--

317
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,322
Come on, we came all this way.

318
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:53,327
- And how do you propose we get there?
- Walk.

319
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:56,796
Well, I'm not going anywhere, guys.
Here, babe.

320
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:01,361
Damn drunk kids.

321
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:14,037
Hey!

322
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,675
What the hell's going on here?

323
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:06,893
Will you shut up?

324
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,895
It's started.

325
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:12,126
They're coming for me and you're dead.

326
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:14,069
But you don't know it yet.

327
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:15,637
Who's coming for you?

328
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:18,174
My boys.

329
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:21,175
They're gonna cut your Iiver out
and eat it in front of you.

330
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:25,679
I don't wanna be in here with this guy.
Can you please put me in the other cell?

331
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:28,910
You're all dead.

332
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,348
You hear me, kid?

333
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,078
Fuck you, old man.

334
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:36,683
You can go home, Mose.

335
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:51,270
- Where are your deputies?
- Covering the festivaI.

336
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:53,272
- Maybe I should stick around?
- What for?

337
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:55,468
You got nobody with you, just in case.

338
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:58,080
It's fine, Mose. He's just a crazy old man.

339
00:28:58,248 --> 00:29:00,648
Just in case.

340
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:04,116
If you don't mind, that is.

341
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:06,715
Okay, but make yourself useful.

342
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,291
Go through the drawers
for the fIashIights.

343
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:12,418
Light ain't gonna save you.

344
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:16,123
If you don't shut up, I'm gonna charge you
with threatening an officer.

345
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,565
Hey, charge away, officer.

346
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:24,167
Shit.

347
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:30,771
Oh, my God.

348
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:35,179
- Is he here?
- Oh, my God, no.

349
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:41,116
Hi, officer.

350
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,418
I think I took a wrong turn.

351
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,561
Can you tell me how to get backstage?

352
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,287
Another wrong turn, huh?

353
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:50,627
I can show you,
but you need a pass to get in.

354
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:53,365
I will do anything to get a pass.

355
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,073
Shit.

356
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:11,185
Deputy Biggs, come in.

357
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:14,188
Junior, it's Angela, come in.

358
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:30,231
Mike, Kevin, you guys out there?

359
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:06,508
Looks like you're all alone,
you dumb bitch.

360
00:31:09,846 --> 00:31:15,580
Four tickets at 90 bucks a pop,
that's 260 bucks.

361
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:17,986
Great.

362
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:24,321
So we sit around in the dark all night.

363
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:26,826
So much fun. So much fun.

364
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:28,464
It's great.

365
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:34,101
You know what? I'm gonna go
and take Billy some food.

366
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:37,502
You think all the power's out
in the jaiI as well?

367
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:43,337
Oh, Iooks like the whoIe town's out.

368
00:31:43,513 --> 00:31:46,949
Yeah. No, of course not. The whoIe
town's out. The whoIe town's out.

369
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:51,213
At the concert, having a good time
like we should be.

370
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:54,787
Here, take this with you.

371
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,949
Oh, thanks.

372
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:02,663
- See you Iater.
- See you, babe.

373
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,664
- See you.
- Bye.

374
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:36,325
Hello?

375
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:10,123
Guys?

376
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,392
Guys.

377
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,331
Guys.

378
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,668
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go see Billy.

379
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,173
- CooI.
- And give you guys some privacy.

380
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:50,567
Happy Halloween, asshoIe.

381
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,106
Son of a bitch!

382
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:56,698
There you go.

383
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,119
What are you doing here?

384
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:19,261
I thought I'd hang out
with Billy and Cruz.

385
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:20,987
Cruz isn't here.

386
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:24,497
What? That's weird.
She left with food about 20 minutes ago.

387
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:25,828
Well, where is she?

388
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,470
I thought she came here.
Maybe she changed her mind.

389
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,697
Visiting hours are over.
Come in the morning.

390
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:33,741
Oh, come on. Can't I just hang out here
for a IittIe whiIe?

391
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:38,745
Yeah, why don't you let him stay?

392
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:42,009
One more dead body to add to the piIe.

393
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:43,851
What the fuck?

394
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,716
This old bastard has been promising
to kill everybody.

395
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,949
He says his boys are coming
to break him out.

396
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,592
And it's just you and the drunk.

397
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,218
- Watch your mouth, kid. I'm sober now.
- It's probabIy best if you go.

398
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:57,525
Don't you want another hand
in case this guy's telling the truth?

399
00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:01,296
You can stay until your friend gets here.
Then you can walk back to the hotel.

400
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:04,463
- What happened to you?
- Fucking kids hit me with a paint balloon.

401
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:06,734
That's why you should walk back
with the girI.

402
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,172
All right.

403
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,910
Hey, man.

404
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,142
So you taIked to my dad?

405
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:20,312
Yeah, I know, he's really, really, really,
extremeIy, monumentally pissed.

406
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,980
Well, I guess I expected that.

407
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:24,991
Yeah, he'll be here in the morning
to post baiI.

408
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:27,356
Did she say
what she's charging you with?

409
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,125
She didn't say,
but there was enough stuff for a feIony.

410
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,469
Man, I'm fucked, aren't I?

411
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,901
Yeah, he's creepy as fuck.

412
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:38,459
Where are you going?

413
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:40,159
Lita....

414
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:42,964
- What?
- I've been thinking.

415
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:45,638
Okay.

416
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:48,004
We both graduate in May.

417
00:37:48,178 --> 00:37:51,909
And I was thinking
we couId move in together.

418
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:57,314
Gus, come on,
you know I'm moving to New York.

419
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,546
I've got my job Iined up.

420
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:02,054
But accounting is so boring.

421
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:04,022
Don't go.

422
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:07,357
Babe, we've taIked about this
a thousand times.

423
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,997
I'm going.

424
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:11,429
Then I'll go with you.

425
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:15,965
Look...

426
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,205
...Gus, I like you.

427
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:22,811
I might even Iove you.

428
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:25,946
But....

429
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,580
I don't know, I just--

430
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:32,721
I need to spend some time on my own.

431
00:38:33,823 --> 00:38:36,018
You understand that?

432
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:38,524
Lita, I Iove you.

433
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,993
And I don't wanna Iose you.

434
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:43,160
Marry me.

435
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,925
What?

436
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:46,966
Oh, my God.

437
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:49,730
You're proposing to me
in some fIeabag moteI...

438
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:52,238
...in the middIe of West Virginia?
Gus, come on.

439
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:55,673
- It's the thought that counts.
- Yeah.

440
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:57,979
Babe...

441
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,842
...come on.

442
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:07,885
Get dressed before Julian comes back.
I'm gonna take a shower.

443
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,795
I'm sorry.

444
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,580
All right. I heard you. Keep your shirt on.

445
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:40,646
Who the fuck are you?

446
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:42,916
You got the wrong hotel room, pal.
Move along.

447
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:47,861
Are you so fucking drunk
you don't speak English?

448
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:50,864
I said, move along, you dumb shit.

449
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:57,138
Gus, who was that?

450
00:39:57,707 --> 00:40:00,175
Some drunk guy from the festivaI.

451
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:01,776
CouIdn't find his room.

452
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:07,546
CooI costume though.

453
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:11,210
Fuck. Stupid shower.

454
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,548
Stupid shower doesn't work.

455
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:15,213
It's freezing.

456
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:20,618
Goddamn, you son of a bitch.

457
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:26,226
Look, I aIready told your drunk IittIe buddy
you got the wrong room.

458
00:40:26,803 --> 00:40:29,203
What is it with you peopIe?

459
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:31,665
What, are you fucking retarded?

460
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:39,505
Gus?

461
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:44,410
Gus, what was that?

462
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:52,383
So where the hell is Cruz?
It can't have taken her this long to get here.

463
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:55,588
- I don't know. You want me to Iook for her?
- She's probabIy dead.

464
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:58,563
My boys aIready got to her on the street.

465
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:00,430
Shut the fuck up, old man.

466
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:04,369
You can say what you like, college boy...

467
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,271
...but your reckoning is on its way.

468
00:41:08,444 --> 00:41:11,140
Hey, can you just shut
this old bastard up?

469
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:13,282
I can't stand Iistening to him anymore.

470
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:15,917
Well, I can't gag him
if that's what you're saying.

471
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:19,179
Give me five minutes with him
and he'll be quiet for the night.

472
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:23,189
You've got yourself in enough troubIe,
young man. Just ignore him.

473
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,290
Gus?

474
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:35,964
Gus?

475
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:32,959
No.

476
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:34,687
PIease.

477
00:42:38,101 --> 00:42:40,092
No.

478
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,781
That's probabIy her now.

479
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,224
Hey, sweetheart.

480
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:05,883
- How's it going?
- It's been an interesting night.

481
00:43:06,062 --> 00:43:09,828
Yeah. I saw the power outage
and I thought I'd bring you some candIes.

482
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:13,633
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks, honey.

483
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:16,533
- Mose, can you Iight some of these for me?
- Sure.

484
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:19,368
So, what's going on?

485
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:23,169
I've got a fugitive who's being picked up
by the marshaIs...

486
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:25,405
...and a kid on drug charges.

487
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,516
- And I bet your night is just starting.
- Yeah, probabIy is.

488
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:30,515
- You hungry?
- Starving.

489
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:34,087
Why don't call your deputies
and come home for a sandwich?

490
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:37,749
I can't reach them
and besides, I should really stay here.

491
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:41,795
Those guys aren't going anywhere.
Take some time for yourself, you know?

492
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,455
Even the sheriff is entitIed
to a Iunch break.

493
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:46,829
- Jason.
- All right.

494
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:49,904
I'll go fix some sandwiches
and I'll be back in a bit.

495
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:52,336
Last supper.

496
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,334
What's his probIem?

497
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:58,776
- Who is that guy?
- Don't ask.

498
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:01,617
Okay. See you soon.

499
00:44:01,784 --> 00:44:03,547
See you Iater.

500
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,290
Help!

501
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,394
Somebody help!

502
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:16,430
PIease! Help!

503
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,897

504
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:22,600
Stop! PIease stop!

505
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,472
Somebody help!

506
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:29,967
Somebody!

507
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:31,545
Help!

508
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:34,381
Help me!

509
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:37,918
Let me go, you crazy fuck.

510
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:42,552
What are you doing?

511
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,417
No.

512
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:46,459
No. No.

513
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:48,657
PIease, no, no.

514
00:45:16,459 --> 00:45:18,120
Fifty cents.

515
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:19,761
Buck.

516
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:21,862
Call.

517
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,902
Who are they?

518
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,971
I don't know.
I never seen the truck before.

519
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:41,316
I told you.

520
00:45:41,784 --> 00:45:44,844
It's my boys. They're here to get me.

521
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:50,322
Shit.

522
00:45:55,064 --> 00:45:57,999
- Help!
- That's Gus.

523
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:03,504
Somebody, please!

524
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:05,334
Help!

525
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:07,135
Help!

526
00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:24,986
Oh, God. We gotta get him out
of the middIe of the road.

527
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:28,922
Oh, I can't. I can't.

528
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:31,699
Give me a hand.

529
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:48,416
One down, huh, sheriff?

530
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:51,951
You're not going anywhere
and you're gonna pay for this.

531
00:46:52,421 --> 00:46:54,582
You hear me, you bastard?

532
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:56,622
What are we gonna do?

533
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:02,557
Get out.

534
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:04,632
- I need to find Cruz.
- And Lita.

535
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,392
Listen to me.

536
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:10,471
You're all deputized.

537
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,466
If you help me, it will go a long way
in my report to the court.

538
00:47:14,643 --> 00:47:17,544
- But I wanna go after my girIfriend.
- No, we all stay here.

539
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,476
We hold out until help arrives.

540
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:22,477
Mose, you watch the front door.

541
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:25,449
You two, cover the windows.

542
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:30,455
They want us to split up. It makes it easier
for them to kill us that way.

543
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:34,619
So we should stick together,
here until dawn. Now, get to your stations.

544
00:47:35,398 --> 00:47:37,866
- We need to call for help.
- Lines are dead. Cell too.

545
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:42,697
Sheriff, Lee has a short-wave radio
in the back of his thrift store. I've seen it.

546
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:45,932
- We need power to operate it.
- Lee has a generator. Good thinking.

547
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:48,508
Listen, I'm gonna go across
the street to the store.

548
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:51,009
I'm gonna fire up the short-wave
and call for help.

549
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,738
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no.

550
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:54,815
You stay
and make sure they don't get in.

551
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:58,044
Not a bright idea there, sheriff.

552
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,485
- SpIit up and die, remember?
- He's right.

553
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:03,386
I will not risk your Iives.

554
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,050
This is my job.
Now, cover me when I'm on the street.

555
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:49,998
Okay.

556
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:52,106
Okay, where are you?

557
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:54,071
Okay, come on.

558
00:48:54,677 --> 00:48:58,306
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you?

559
00:48:59,882 --> 00:49:01,247
Yes.

560
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,528
Okay.

561
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:25,263
Okay.

562
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:32,937
Okay.

563
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:34,309
Gas.

564
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:35,973
Gas.

565
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:39,511
Yeah.

566
00:49:44,927 --> 00:49:46,485
Okay.

567
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:07,404
- We should go help her.
- Nope. I gave my word I'd stay here.

568
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,483
- I'll go.
- Give it a minute.

569
00:50:09,652 --> 00:50:12,382
- Just-- If we hear another shot, we'll go.
- But we don't--

570
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:14,819
We don't know this woman.
She's not Cruz or Lita.

571
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,323
- We should be going after them. Just wait.
- Let's go find the girIs.

572
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:22,089
If you leave, they'll throw the book at you.
Wait a few minutes, see if she comes.

573
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:25,700
- If she does, we'll tell her we're both going.
- All right.

574
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:27,802
Ten minutes.

575
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,097
This is Sheriff Carter of FairIake
decIaring emergency.

576
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:06,468
Ls anyone out there? Over.

577
00:51:11,614 --> 00:51:14,640
Sheriff Carter of Fairlake, West Virginia
declaring an emergency.

578
00:51:14,817 --> 00:51:17,342
Can anyone hear me? Over.

579
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,488
Yup, l hear you, sheriff.

580
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:23,018
What's your name and where are you?

581
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:26,417
Teddy Tabet.
I'm in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire.

582
00:51:26,595 --> 00:51:29,325
Okay, listen to me carefully, Teddy.

583
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:32,797
L need you to call the Virginia State Police
in Moundsville.

584
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:36,597
Have them send every avaiIabIe officer
to FairIake right away.

585
00:51:36,772 --> 00:51:38,137
It's an emergency.

586
00:51:38,774 --> 00:51:40,207
What's going on down there?

587
00:51:40,376 --> 00:51:43,709
The town is under siege by three hillbillies.
They're trying to break...

588
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:47,747
...one of their relatives out of jail.
They've already killed one person already.

589
00:51:48,717 --> 00:51:51,515
Did you say FairIake, West Virginia?

590
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:53,882
Yes, that's right.
And we have no phone service.

591
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:57,219
So I need you to call the state poIice
right away. Can you do that?

592
00:51:57,393 --> 00:51:59,554
Okay, okay. One minute.

593
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:10,430
Are you stoned?

594
00:52:11,306 --> 00:52:12,364
What?

595
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:16,039
Are you stoned or do you just think
I'm stupid?

596
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:19,078
What are you taIking about, Teddy?
I need your help.

597
00:52:19,248 --> 00:52:21,409
Tonight's the Mountain Man Festival,
right?

598
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:24,643
You think it would be funny
to scrambIe the entire state poIice...

599
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,788
...because you convinced
some dork to call?

600
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:28,149
This is reaI.

601
00:52:28,323 --> 00:52:30,484
I am the sheriff and I need your help.

602
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:31,819
This is serious, Teddy.

603
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:35,361
Hey, listen, it's a felony
to file a fake police report, okay?

604
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:38,864
I'm not stupid. We here in Dixville Notch
are a pretty savvy bunch.

605
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,865
You can't pull the wooI over my eyes.

606
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:43,368
So, yeah, have a good night, officer.

607
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,406
Wait, wait, wait. PIease, Iisten, Teddy,
you gotta beIieve me.

608
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,304
This is a matter of Iife and death.

609
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:57,445
- Shit.
- What was that?

610
00:52:57,619 --> 00:52:58,881
Somebody dying.

611
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:02,251
You beIieve me now, asshoIe?
Just call the poIice.

612
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:15,136
- I think I got one of them.
- Shit, shit.

613
00:53:15,704 --> 00:53:18,104
You idiot. What if that was the sheriff?

614
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:29,308
Are you hurt?

615
00:53:30,552 --> 00:53:33,077
Oh, my God. Is that Gus?

616
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:34,347
Is that Gus?

617
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,081
Come inside.

618
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,151
Oh, my God.

619
00:53:42,297 --> 00:53:45,425
All right, okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

620
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:51,201
Julian, let me in.

621
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:56,402
- What happened?
- This drunk nearIy killed my friend.

622
00:53:56,578 --> 00:53:57,943
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

623
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:00,673
- He has no business carrying a gun.
- It was an accident!

624
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:03,841
- I should beat this shit out of you!
- Hey, caIm down. CaIm down.

625
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:06,783
I said, caIm down.

626
00:54:09,825 --> 00:54:11,315
- Were you hit?
- No.

627
00:54:11,493 --> 00:54:12,960
Okay. Have you seen Cruz?

628
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,891
Were you with her?

629
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,457
She left before Julian.

630
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,999
She's dead, Iover boy.

631
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:24,136
ProbabIy being digested right now.

632
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,833
My boys have a taste for fIesh...

633
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:30,808
...especially cute IittIe bIonds.

634
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,971
Will you shut the fuck up?

635
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:37,947
If anything happened to her,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

636
00:54:47,729 --> 00:54:49,560
Let me go...

637
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:53,633
...and maybe the rest of them
will Iive to see the dawn.

638
00:54:53,802 --> 00:54:55,360
You're not getting out of there.

639
00:54:55,537 --> 00:54:58,404
There's four of you and one of her.

640
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:00,599
Think how much you wanna Iive.

641
00:55:00,776 --> 00:55:04,212
You're out of your mind if you think
any one of us is gonna let you out.

642
00:55:04,947 --> 00:55:06,574
Suit yourselves.

643
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:12,111
Did you reach anybody
on the short-wave?

644
00:55:12,287 --> 00:55:14,414
- Yes.
- Great. That means help is coming.

645
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,114
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

646
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:19,749
The dumb shit on the other Iine,
I don't think he beIieved me.

647
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:22,520
- I'm going to Iook for Cruz.
- Hey, I told you, no.

648
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:26,031
- Well, then you better Iock me back up.
- What?

649
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:27,600
All right, I may be a fuck-up.

650
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:32,638
I'm irresponsibIe, I'm unreIiabIe
and I'm definiteIy juveniIe, but I am IoyaI.

651
00:55:33,408 --> 00:55:35,103
I Iove Cruz.

652
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:38,609
I Iove her more than anything
I've ever Ioved in my Iife...

653
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,840
...and I'm not gonna sit in here
whiIe she's out there on her own.

654
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:44,281
I couIdn't Iive with myseIf if I did that.

655
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:48,446
So either Iock me up or let me go.

656
00:55:50,459 --> 00:55:53,895
- Here, you're gonna need this.
- Thank you.

657
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:58,132
- I'm going with you.
- All right.

658
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:02,328
You gonna be all right?

659
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,561
Be carefuI.

660
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,864
We will.

661
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:18,280
We'll Iook around here,
see if we can find her.

662
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,154
All right. Keep your eyes open.

663
00:56:27,496 --> 00:56:29,259
Cruz.

664
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:32,723
Cruz, it's Billy.

665
00:56:32,901 --> 00:56:34,596
Come out.

666
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,032
If Cruz knows what's up,
she'll be hiding and won't come out.

667
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:42,642
Yeah.

668
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,848
I hope that's the case.

669
00:56:59,361 --> 00:57:02,956
- Mister?
- Call me Mose.

670
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:08,036
Why are they doing this?

671
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,561
They wanna break him out, I suppose.

672
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:13,503
But killing innocent peopIe?

673
00:57:14,576 --> 00:57:16,635
Why kill Gus?

674
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:19,940
He had nothing to do
with keeping that old guy Iocked up.

675
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:23,881
I get the feeIing that killing ain't too much
of a stretch for this bunch.

676
00:57:28,056 --> 00:57:29,648
What if no help comes?

677
00:57:30,392 --> 00:57:32,257
It will. Don't worry.

678
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:37,395
And Billy and Julian?

679
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:39,662
They'll find your friend...

680
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,598
...and then they'll be back.

681
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:50,004
Cruz!

682
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:52,711
Are you out there?

683
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:56,380
- Where the hell couId she be?
- I don't know, man.

684
00:57:59,421 --> 00:58:00,445
Jesus Christ.

685
00:58:00,622 --> 00:58:02,487
What the hell was that?

686
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,388
Move, Billy.

687
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,730
Shit. Shit.

688
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:15,134
We gotta get out of the street.
We're sitting ducks.

689
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:16,930
There.

690
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:37,284
Oh, shit. Cruz.

691
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:39,757
Oh, my God, baby.

692
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:40,952
Oh, my God.

693
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:42,391
Oh, my God.

694
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:43,792
Oh, Cruz.

695
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:46,832
What kind of fucking animaIs are they?

696
00:58:47,002 --> 00:58:48,765
There's nothing we can do for her now.

697
00:58:48,937 --> 00:58:50,097
I'm taking her back.

698
00:58:50,272 --> 00:58:53,264
I'm not gonna leave her here
like some piece of trash.

699
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:57,040
Oh, Jesus.

700
00:59:00,148 --> 00:59:01,513
Son of a bitch.

701
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:03,581
Billy!

702
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,116
Julian.

703
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:08,549
Julian.

704
01:00:08,722 --> 01:00:10,451
Wake up!

705
01:00:11,959 --> 01:00:13,620
- Fuck.
- Shit.

706
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:15,318
Oh, God, Bi--

707
01:00:15,496 --> 01:00:17,327
- Billy, what's going on?
- I can't move.

708
01:00:17,498 --> 01:00:19,864
I can't move.
You gotta get out of that chain, man.

709
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,500
Chain?

710
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:22,927
Can you get out?

711
01:00:23,103 --> 01:00:24,593
Shit.

712
01:00:25,773 --> 01:00:27,741
Fuck. No. Just-- No.

713
01:00:27,908 --> 01:00:29,933
- Fuck.
- No, there's--

714
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,840
We gotta call for help. All right?

715
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,406
Help!

716
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:36,048
Help!

717
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,308
Help!

718
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:39,782
Help!

719
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:42,413
- Help us, anybody!
- Help!

720
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:45,353
- Anybody!
- Help!

721
01:00:45,526 --> 01:00:47,084
Fuck.

722
01:00:48,128 --> 01:00:50,790
Where is he? Where is he?

723
01:00:51,265 --> 01:00:52,960
Where is he?

724
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:57,064
Oh, my, God. Oh, my, God.

725
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:03,739
Help!

726
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:05,538
Help!

727
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:09,380
Help us!

728
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,074
Anybody!

729
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,048
Help!

730
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:18,958
Julian. Julian, save me.

731
01:01:19,126 --> 01:01:21,287
Save-- Help me, man!

732
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:23,827
What the--? What the fuck?

733
01:01:23,997 --> 01:01:26,056
No, don't. No, don't.

734
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,064
Fuck.

735
01:01:35,475 --> 01:01:38,603
No, don't-- Don't leave me.

736
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:41,441
Julian, don't leave me. Don't leave me.

737
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,912
No!

738
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,643
No! No! No!

739
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:49,645
Julian! Stop it, you motherfucker!

740
01:02:10,077 --> 01:02:11,271
What--?

741
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,737
We can't sit here all night
and wait for them to come back.

742
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:20,539
- Somebody needs to go for help.
- Yes, and that has to be you, Mose.

743
01:03:21,515 --> 01:03:23,278
Can you do it?

744
01:03:27,621 --> 01:03:30,089
Hey, Lita.

745
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:34,621
Why don't you save yourself?

746
01:03:35,796 --> 01:03:36,956
How?

747
01:03:37,764 --> 01:03:41,791
Convince her to let me out of here.

748
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:44,403
- I can do it, sheriff.
- Take my truck.

749
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,698
Take it to the fairgrounds
and find Junior...

750
01:03:46,873 --> 01:03:49,603
...and the other deputies
and bring them back here.

751
01:03:49,776 --> 01:03:52,404
Do not stop for anyone or anything.

752
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,444
Me and my boys will go...

753
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:58,516
...disappear into the night.
You'll be safe.

754
01:03:58,685 --> 01:04:00,152
I don't trust you.

755
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,447
Why would I stick around here?

756
01:04:02,622 --> 01:04:04,112
Think about it.

757
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:07,954
You're a college kid. Use your head.

758
01:04:08,128 --> 01:04:12,292
Save yourself and your friends.

759
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:14,024
Mose...

760
01:04:15,669 --> 01:04:17,000
...you okay?

761
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:19,597
I couId do with a drink.

762
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:22,232
I won't.

763
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:24,800
You can count on me, AngeIa.

764
01:04:24,978 --> 01:04:28,744
I know not too many peopIe have counted
on me in the past to do anything right...

765
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:33,215
...but I'm turning over a new Ieaf,
starting tonight.

766
01:04:33,387 --> 01:04:36,356
I will be back with help. I promise.

767
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:39,716
Why don't you just give them
what they want? Give them the old man.

768
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:43,795
- You can track them when you have help.
- No. I want justice.

769
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:45,192
Justice?

770
01:04:45,365 --> 01:04:48,596
What about justice for my boyfriend
whose body is Iying on your porch?

771
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:50,293
What about justice for Gus, huh?

772
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,596
Don't you see?

773
01:04:51,772 --> 01:04:56,141
If I let him go, you may never get justice
for your boyfriend.

774
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,473
Look, I'm sorry about what happened
to you, but you're not changing my mind.

775
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:03,874
You ready?

776
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:05,682
Let's do this.

777
01:05:05,852 --> 01:05:09,982
There's a radio in my truck.
Keep in constant contact and be carefuI.

778
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:13,354
My truck is at the gas station
by the junkyard.

779
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:15,222
I'll cover you.

780
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:32,374
Go. Go, go.

781
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:41,884
God, come on, come on, come on.
PIease, please, please start.

782
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,363
You can do it.

783
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:02,432
Mose, can you hear me?

784
01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:06,045
L got you, sheriff.
L'm on my way like a bat out of hell.

785
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,908
I need you there in one piece.

786
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:09,673
Not too fast, okay?

787
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:10,874
Roger that.

788
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:16,952
I'm just getting on the highway now,
sheriff.

789
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:18,682
No sign of them.

790
01:06:18,859 --> 01:06:20,554
Good, keep me posted.

791
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,524
I told you, I wouldn't let you--

792
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,595
Shit.

793
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:36,709
Mose?

794
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,704
Mose?

795
01:06:41,515 --> 01:06:44,109
Mose? Come in, Mose.

796
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:45,615
Mose?

797
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:08,631
Billy and Julian should have been back
by now, shouldn't they?

798
01:08:09,069 --> 01:08:10,593
I know.

799
01:08:11,404 --> 01:08:13,497
They're dead, aren't they?

800
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,538
We don't know that.

801
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:18,335
I don't wanna die here.

802
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:21,347
Neither do I.

803
01:08:21,881 --> 01:08:23,508
I wanna leave.

804
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,843
There's no pIace to go.

805
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,009
There must be a car
or a truck or something.

806
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,384
- Mose took my only truck.
- Well, then I'll steaI a car. Anything.

807
01:08:30,557 --> 01:08:32,491
I just need to get the fuck out of here.

808
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:34,752
You know how to hot-wire a car?

809
01:08:34,995 --> 01:08:36,326
No.

810
01:08:36,496 --> 01:08:40,933
Look, the festivaI will be over soon.
My deputies will be back.

811
01:08:41,401 --> 01:08:43,335
We just have to wait a IittIe longer.

812
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:47,068
- And what if I can't wait that long?
- You really don't have a choice.

813
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,073
To go out there now by yourself
would be suicide.

814
01:08:50,777 --> 01:08:52,711
Not if you come with me.

815
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,676
I can't leave here.

816
01:08:54,848 --> 01:08:56,839
There's two of us left.

817
01:08:57,017 --> 01:09:00,248
What can we possibIy do
if they come for him?

818
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,512
Our best.

819
01:09:01,688 --> 01:09:03,713
I think you're crazier than he is.

820
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,966
Sheriff. Help me, sheriff.

821
01:09:16,136 --> 01:09:18,331
Sheriff!

822
01:09:24,311 --> 01:09:26,472
Sheriff. Sheriff. Help me.

823
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:32,006
Oh, no. PIease. Don't do it.

824
01:09:32,185 --> 01:09:34,153
Help me.

825
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:19,192
You can surprise her.

826
01:10:19,366 --> 01:10:23,598
Take her weapon
and force her to let me out.

827
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:27,531
- I can't.
- She's just a woman.

828
01:10:27,707 --> 01:10:28,935
Leave me alone.

829
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:30,974
I wanna see you Iive.

830
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:34,045
You're smart, Lita. Too smart to die.

831
01:10:34,214 --> 01:10:35,977
I said, leave me alone.

832
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,276
You're smarter than your friends.

833
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,646
Hell, you even got away
from my boys once.

834
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,651
You deserve to Iive.

835
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:47,857
I will tell my boys to let you Iive...

836
01:10:48,027 --> 01:10:51,190
...if you help me.

837
01:10:51,431 --> 01:10:52,693
I don't beIieve you.

838
01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:55,624
Well...

839
01:10:56,069 --> 01:11:00,506
...you and that bitch are certainIy gonna die
if you just stand there and do nothing.

840
01:11:01,141 --> 01:11:04,076
That I can guarantee you.

841
01:11:07,547 --> 01:11:09,481
No. No.

842
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:11,173
No.

843
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,613
No!

844
01:11:12,786 --> 01:11:14,310
No!

845
01:11:14,487 --> 01:11:16,751
No!

846
01:11:16,923 --> 01:11:18,982
No!

847
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:24,021
Do you hear that?

848
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,858
What?

849
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,249
It's Mose.

850
01:11:45,418 --> 01:11:46,908
Well, where's it coming from?

851
01:12:07,607 --> 01:12:10,303
He's in the thrift store. Here, take this.

852
01:12:10,477 --> 01:12:13,071
Watch him.
If anyone comes in, shoot them.

853
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,646
- Wha--? What are you gonna do?
- What I can.

854
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:18,181
Oh, God.

855
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,255
Now's your chance.

856
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:39,063
No.

857
01:12:39,239 --> 01:12:41,173
Oh, don't be stupid.

858
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:43,002
Save yourself.

859
01:12:43,176 --> 01:12:46,168
Have some vision.

860
01:12:46,346 --> 01:12:47,836
You're smart.

861
01:12:48,014 --> 01:12:49,413
And you wanna Iive, don't you?

862
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:53,643
Yes.

863
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,720
Well, then open this cell.

864
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:59,347
I will go away and so will my boys.

865
01:12:59,926 --> 01:13:01,450
Think.

866
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:06,031
- How can I trust you?
- Well, you have the gun, don't you?

867
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,393
You open this cell...

868
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:12,094
...and I will walk away.

869
01:13:12,272 --> 01:13:13,364
Promise.

870
01:13:16,442 --> 01:13:20,310
The keys are in the gun Iocker
to your left.

871
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:24,176
That's it.

872
01:13:26,786 --> 01:13:28,481
Good girI.

873
01:13:29,022 --> 01:13:32,924
It is as simpIe as turning a key in a Iock.

874
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:38,120
That right there in your hand
is the key to your Iife.

875
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,964
If I let you out of here...

876
01:13:43,136 --> 01:13:44,467
...you let me go free, right?

877
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:47,197
You and your men,
you don't come after me.

878
01:13:47,473 --> 01:13:50,033
That's the deaI, right?

879
01:13:50,209 --> 01:13:51,904
Done deaI.

880
01:13:52,078 --> 01:13:54,444
If you try anything...

881
01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:57,981
...I swear to God, I will kill you.

882
01:13:58,151 --> 01:14:01,177
All I want is to get out of here.

883
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:03,349
Back up.

884
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,888
Go.

885
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,832
Okay, get out of here. Slowly.

886
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:28,076
Move.

887
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:44,026
You know, Lita, you did the right thing.

888
01:14:44,197 --> 01:14:45,721
Just get out of here.

889
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,198
Oh, and...

890
01:14:50,803 --> 01:14:53,567
...you know what I was saying
about vision?

891
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:03,983
Somebody help me.

892
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,085
Somebody help me.

893
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,653
- Lita?
- My eyes.

894
01:15:09,822 --> 01:15:11,187
God.

895
01:15:13,726 --> 01:15:15,785
I warned you, bitch.

896
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,324
Goddamn it.

897
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:25,266
Lita. Come on. Come on.

898
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,167
- My eyes.
- You're gonna be all right.

899
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,171
- You're gonna be all right.
- My eyes.

900
01:15:29,342 --> 01:15:30,832
Come on.

901
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,374
- Come on. Go.
- Oh, my God.

902
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:35,639
Oh, my God.

903
01:15:40,353 --> 01:15:42,685
Get your fucking hands up.

904
01:15:43,322 --> 01:15:45,950
- Get--
- Fuck you.

905
01:16:11,951 --> 01:16:14,749
I'm gonna bandage you
to stop the bIeeding, okay?

906
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:17,546
Put your head back.

907
01:16:22,228 --> 01:16:24,560
Oh, God, I'm so stupid.

908
01:16:32,305 --> 01:16:34,000
Okay, sweetie, okay.

909
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,570
What happened?

910
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:39,041
He promised.

911
01:16:39,212 --> 01:16:42,181
He promised he would just leave
if I let him out.

912
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,873
- And you beIieved him?
- I didn't know what eIse to do.

913
01:16:45,051 --> 01:16:48,418
Lita, you're gonna have to Iisten to me
if we're gonna make it out aIive.

914
01:16:48,588 --> 01:16:51,113
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

915
01:16:51,557 --> 01:16:52,922
Good.

916
01:16:53,092 --> 01:16:56,459
What about me? I'm bIeeding here.

917
01:16:56,629 --> 01:16:58,654
Yeah, you're on your own.

918
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,729
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy watching you die.

919
01:17:04,403 --> 01:17:06,268
Not if you die first.

920
01:17:07,573 --> 01:17:10,269
Go ahead. Shoot me again.

921
01:17:10,743 --> 01:17:13,541
- Get it over with.
- Don't tempt me.

922
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:15,578
You're a fucking coward.

923
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,074
You don't have the guts.

924
01:17:22,155 --> 01:17:25,056
I'm gonna be there
when they stick a needIe in your arm.

925
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,623
Yeah.

926
01:17:26,793 --> 01:17:29,887
Well, you just go right on telling
yourself that, baby.

927
01:17:34,534 --> 01:17:35,558
I'm gonna go for help.

928
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:38,465
You stay here and don't do anything,
okay?

929
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:43,575
- I'm gonna Iock the door behind me.
- You ain't never coming back, bitch.

930
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,883
Jason?

931
01:18:20,513 --> 01:18:22,037
Jason.

932
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:31,847
No. Oh, no. Jason.

933
01:18:32,024 --> 01:18:34,857
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.

934
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:38,860
Oh, God.

935
01:18:39,031 --> 01:18:40,396
Oh, God.

936
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,185
I want you to remember this voice, Lita...

937
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:41,392
...because it's gonna be the Iast one
you'll ever hear.

938
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,965
I'm gonna whisper in your ear
right before I sIit your throat...

939
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:50,394
...which is only a matter of time now.

940
01:19:51,103 --> 01:19:54,869
Just shut up. Shut up.

941
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,669
Maybe I won't kill you right away.

942
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:01,109
Maybe I'll keep you aIive a IittIe whiIe.

943
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,770
Yeah.

944
01:20:03,516 --> 01:20:04,847
Because I'm gonna fuck you.

945
01:20:05,017 --> 01:20:06,143
No.

946
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:09,117
Shut up, just shut up!

947
01:20:09,288 --> 01:20:11,552
And then my three boys
are gonna fuck you.

948
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,316
No.

949
01:20:14,493 --> 01:20:16,290
And then when we're done...

950
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:20,131
...I'm gonna cut your titties off
as a souvenir.

951
01:20:20,299 --> 01:20:22,597
Oh, God.

952
01:20:24,103 --> 01:20:26,537
You run away.

953
01:20:27,974 --> 01:20:30,272
That makes it more fun.

954
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,578
You run, IittIe girI.

955
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,153
Because I'm coming to get you.

956
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:05,809
Well, now, Iooks like
we've come full circIe, huh, sheriff?

957
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:08,173
I Iove irony.

958
01:21:08,347 --> 01:21:10,008
- Don't you?
- They'll find you.

959
01:21:10,182 --> 01:21:12,207
Oh, I highIy doubt that.

960
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:14,444
We're just fixing to leave town.

961
01:21:15,087 --> 01:21:17,317
I hope you burn in hell.

962
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:23,956
Well, now, sorry to disappoint,
but you're the one that's gonna burn.

963
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,791
All right, boys, that'll do it.

964
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:40,476
Now, sheriff,
out of the kindness of my heart...

965
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,944
...I am offering you a choice...

966
01:21:43,115 --> 01:21:45,879
...which is reaI gentIemanlike of me,
don't you think?

967
01:21:46,052 --> 01:21:47,110
Fuck you.

968
01:21:50,423 --> 01:21:53,187
A fighter to the end, huh?

969
01:21:55,895 --> 01:21:57,829
AdmirabIe.

970
01:21:58,798 --> 01:21:59,958
Now...

971
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:05,832
...as I am a man of mercy, let me expIain
to you what is happening here.

972
01:22:06,405 --> 01:22:10,205
I am gonna duct-tape this shotgun
to your mouth...

973
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:13,038
...and I have attached a wire
to the trigger...

974
01:22:13,212 --> 01:22:15,043
...which is aIso attached to your foot.

975
01:22:15,214 --> 01:22:19,082
So that when you come down
off your tippy-toes...

976
01:22:19,718 --> 01:22:22,619
...the wire is gonna pull the trigger.

977
01:22:22,788 --> 01:22:26,451
Essentially, I am offering you a way out,
sheriff.

978
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,149
If I were you, I would take it...

979
01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:33,264
...because burning to death
is one painfuI way to die.

980
01:22:33,432 --> 01:22:35,024
You son of a bitch.

981
01:23:00,459 --> 01:23:03,485
Tick tock, sheriff.

982
01:23:03,662 --> 01:23:04,686
Gotta go.

983
01:23:14,373 --> 01:23:16,398
There, that ought to do it.

984
01:23:18,544 --> 01:23:22,503
Now, all you have to do...

985
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,816
...is let go.

986
01:23:25,985 --> 01:23:29,318
HeeIs to the fIoor and:

987
01:23:31,724 --> 01:23:33,658
No more.

988
01:23:35,461 --> 01:23:38,396
Oh, you don't need to thank me, sheriff.

989
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,295
You hang on in there, huh?

990
01:24:47,132 --> 01:24:50,295
All right, let's get out of here.

991
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,027
Stop.

992
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:22,395

Oh, please.

Oh, thank God you stopped.

1001
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,851
They killed my friends.

1002
01:25:48,027 --> 01:25:51,588
You need to call the police
before they kill the sheriff, please.

1003
01:25:51,764 --> 01:25:53,959
PIease help me.

1004
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:01,134
Oh, thank God.

Thank God.
