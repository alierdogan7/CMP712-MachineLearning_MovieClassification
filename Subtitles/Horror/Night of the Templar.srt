272
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,357
So you're a professional

Actually, no.

me after the show.

gave me the gig.

me the number one rule?

Amy.

290

We're not supposed
to tell anyone
why we're here

because it will
ruin the surprise
and defeat the challenge.

Excellent. But,
as coordinator,

293

day, huh?

523
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,419
Picking apples.

524
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,622
Hm. What can I say?

525
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,691
I love the orchard.

526
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:30,594
[shouting]

527
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,664
And the blood?
Is it yours?

528
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:39,369
[grunts and groans]

529
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,638
It is now.

530
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,274
Messy business, huh,
this apple picking.

531
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:48,145
It is. How are
you, my brother?

532
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:51,114
I'm ready to go
to battle again on
your command, my lord.

533
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,717
I'm not your lord,
I am your brother.

534
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,318
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

535
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,221
[horse neighs]

536
00:35:58,223 --> 00:36:00,290
(stunted speech)
We won,
Gregoire, we won!

537
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,659
Yes, again we
were victorious.

538
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:07,430
When will I be
ready to fight,
my lord?

539
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,132
We've spoken
of this, Koko.

540
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,735
Every day!

541
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,703
Then when?

542
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,739
It is not your time,
little one.

543
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,241
It is not
your place.

544
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,110
You always say--

545
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:23,280
Koko, is there not
somewhere of more importance

546
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,148
where you should be?

547
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,384
Yes, my lord.

548
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,119
Then get there.

549
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:33,089
<i>Aha, yes, my lord.</i>
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

550
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,693
But when you need
me, I am ready.

551
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:42,232
[laughing]

552
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,134
Get that from him.

553
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,535
He is waiting
for the day

554
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,870
you allow him to
shield and fight.

555
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,372
And he'd be
lost in an instant.

556
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,776
<i>His strength lies</i>
<i>not in sword,</i>
<i>dear Melkon--</i>

557
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,844

558
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,447
his heart.
Sergeant?

559
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,217
Vicinity scouted,
my lord. All sound.

560
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,319
Excellent.
Where's Devereux?

561
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:06,556
<i>Dwyer?</i>

562
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,192
How many did we lose?

563
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:14,798
Nearly a third, my lord.

564
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,734
Prisoners?

565
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,502
Prisoners?!

566
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,738
None, they would
not surrender,
my lord.

567
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,610
Ah. Such valor.

568
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:30,180
If only their
beliefs were proper.

569
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,882
Ah then,
scour the acre.

570
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,851
We leave no man behind.

571
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,655
<i>We've already been</i>
<i>around twice, my lord.</i>

572
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:42,792
Then you need
only scour
once more.

573
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,893
Yes, my lord.

574
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,862

Hello, children.

578
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,741
I heard we had
some visitors
in town,

579
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,809
and I wanted to take
the opportunity--

580

<i>(Shauna)</i>
<i>Who is it?</i>

581

Is there something
we can help you
with, Father?

583
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,692
<i>Because if this is</i>

we happen to be short
on money at the moment.

585
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,196
This is not
about money.

586
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,699
It's just that I
wanted to welcome
you to town

587
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:26,703
and take the opportunity
to invite you to
the house of God.

588
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,571

from here, and

590
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,946
we've never
seen you before.

591
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,451
You attend Mass?

592
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:43,920
- No.
- No.

593
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,757
Well, that's why
you haven't seen me.

594
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:51,661
But now we
know each other,

595
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:58,768
I'll be sure that
I see you again
very, very soon.

596
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,508
And I'm looking
forward to it.

597
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,358
Well, who do
we have here?

598
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,996
I'm really glad
I stopped by.

599
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,504
It's certainly--

600
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,340
a refreshing surprise--

601
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,842
to have you all here.

602
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,053

I had bargained for.

But it's most strange,

608
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:20,016

00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:41,438
Oh, that? No, just
a hobby I picked up.

613
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,740
Mostly for cardio.

614
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:47,677
You know, trying to keep
the old midsection flat.

615
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,982
I've tried so many things.
Tennis, swimming.

616
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:57,987
But, uh-- that
one stuck.
Go figure.

617

So, what can
I do for you?

620
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,898
Oh, right. I'm at
the Rhein estate

621
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,636
I'm here to pick up an order
for a, uh, chef called Shauna

Coming right up.

626
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,848
Thank you.

627

Yeah, he comes
in here, uh--

628
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:35,859
once in a while

01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:38,713
Aye, and t'is our unity
that gives us strength,
is it not?

1056
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:42,517
By God's divine grace,
we are a glorious force.

1057
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,219
Skilled at
confronting the enemy,

1058
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,654
luring him in,
catching him unawares.

1059
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,523
Victorious time
and time again!

1060
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,158
Aye, victorious.

1061
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,060
And to the victors
goes the spoils.

1062
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:55,096
Such is the way of
conquering nations,
is it not?

1063
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,532
Conquering nation?

1064
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,268
I did not
know we'd become
a conquering nation.

1065
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,606
I was under the belief
that we're still yet
an order. Hm?

1066
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:07,876
And I say to you it
is time we cease
to worry

1067
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:11,546
<i>about the welfare</i>
<i>of the poor and</i>
<i>the weak!</i>

1068
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:14,149
Let their fate
be in the hands
of God.

1069
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:18,520
How has your heart
become so blackened?

1070
01:09:18,522 --> 01:09:21,389
<i>I see it in your eye.</i>

1071
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,091
You've lost your way.

1072
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:25,627
Nay, Brother.
I have found it.

1073
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:29,430
And I will attain it
with the treasure in
yond wagon.

1074
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:32,267
Let us seize this
opportunity together, Gregoire.

1075
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,537
<i>Truly we would have</i>
<i>none of it if not</i>
<i>for you.</i>

1076
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:39,174
Think of the comforts
such a treasure
would buy.

1077
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:43,745
The pleasures that
we might finally
delight in.

1078
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,547
What say you, brother?

1079
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:48,383
I would rather be eaten
by a pack of wolves

1080
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:51,586
than allow your evil venom
to course through my veins.

1081
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:55,790
You are
an honorable man.

1082
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,758
Pity.

1083
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,398
Melkon! Behind you!

1084
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:09,604
[grunts and groans]

1085
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,473

1086
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,867

My lord--
my lord--

1087
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,636
Shhh.

1088
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:43,871

1089
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:45,139

<i>I'm sorry, milord.</i>

1093
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:52,880
I am but
small and weak.

1094
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,415
[weeps]

1095
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:57,252
I failed you.

1096
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,387
Would you forgive me?

1097
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,623
<i>You are braver</i>
<i>than any man</i>

1098
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,358
I have ever
met in battle.

1099
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,261
Was I a good servant?

1100
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,529
Servant? No.

1101
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:13,234
I see you more
as a leader
of men.

1102
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:15,436
[distant thunder]

1103
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,506
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you.

1104
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:30,218
Brother, how will
you sleep tonight?

1105
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,420
Knowing that I'm
no longer number two.

1106
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:33,388
[sword slides]
Oh!

1107
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,357
[panting]

1108
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,360
Turn. Turn
and look at me

1109
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:43,564
that I
may see your face
as I take your life.

1110
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:47,669
No, I will not give
you that satisfaction.

1111
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:51,839
You have not earned it.

1112
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:55,576
I am better
than you.

1113
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:59,947
Only in cowardice,
my dear brother.

1114
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,483
Only in cowardice.

1115
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:03,584

[groan]
[thud]

1117
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:15,330
Best of friends,
dear Melkon.

1118
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:18,232
We were--best of friends.

1119
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:25,239
<i>Dear brothers, farewell.</i>

1120
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:29,610
We shall ride again--

1121
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:33,881
backstabbers.

1122
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:34,949

1123
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:38,319

<i>(Renault)</i>
<i>The people can fend</i>
<i>for themselves, brother.</i>

1125
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:46,561
In the meantime, I shall
enjoy enough fortune for
ten lifetimes of excess!

1126
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,730
[laughing]

1127
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:52,867
And now Gregoire,
it is time for
you to die.

1128
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,837
So be it.

1129
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:59,540
But I will avenge
the deaths of my brothers.

1130
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:03,311
You have made your pact
with the devil, Renault.

1131
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:08,783
You will have your
ten lifetimes of excess.

1132
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,285
But then--

1133
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:12,387
I will
come for you.

1134
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,024
All of you.

1135
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:19,427

1142
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:44,419
[weeping]
Whoever wrote
this inscription

1143
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,924
wasn't kidding.

1144
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,528
Passion, loyalty,
deceit, betrayal--

1145
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:54,996
And revenge.

1146
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:00,868
Right.
And revenge.

1147
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:04,505
[sniffing]

1148
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:08,609
Do you think Gregoire
is going to carry out
his curse?

1149
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:12,079
Yes.
Most definitely.

1150
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:18,653
They have
like 10 lifetimes.

1151
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,989
[sniffing]

1152
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:26,861
Say they realize
their mistakes,

1153
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:29,564
that they made--

1154
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:34,702
and they
try to rebuild--

1155
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:38,539
what is it called?

1156
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,108
Their spiritual temples.

1157
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:45,112
Do you think that
he would spare them?

1158
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,949
<i>(Jake)</i>
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1159
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:52,553
But I believe one
must truly desire
to change.

1160
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:56,824
(Jake)
And even then, ultimately,
it'll be in God's hands.

1161
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,493
[thunder]

1162
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:00,862
And if they don't
change their ways?

1163
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:02,897
<i>Then as prophesized--</i>

1164
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,500
Lord Gregoire will
kill them all,

1165
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,134
without mercy,

1166
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:11,038
and take
their wretched
souls to hell.

1167
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,442
It is spoken
from his lips
to God's ears...

1168
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:17,645
it is the inevitable.

1169
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,528
What are your thoughts?

1170
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,763
I'd say go
for the ten
lifetimes of excess.

1171
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,164
I mean, what
the fuck, right?

1172
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,433
<i>I don't agree.</i>

1173
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:45,640
But I guess everybody
has a right to their
own opinion.

1174
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:48,743
[coughing]

1175
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:53,180
You're smart.
And you're cute too.

1176
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,516
<i>You think I'm cute?</i>

1177
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:59,754
Yep. I noticed you
first time we got
in the car.

1178
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,155
I think we should
spend this time

1179
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:04,992
to get to know
each other better.

1180
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:08,095
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1181
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,564
I'm just getting
to know you.

1182
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:10,865
What happened
to Celine?

1183
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:12,600
Celine isn't
here right now!

1184
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:14,735
Stop! Stop it!

01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:15,703

01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:24,645
Fine! Fuck it.
Not her then,
my fault.

1191
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:27,048
Shit.

01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,616

01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:41,095
I should have never
left you alone

01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,999
Look at me.
It won't happen again.

1196
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,602
He'll never
touch you again.

1197
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:50,738
Hear me?

1198
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,039
I'm sorry, Amy.

1199
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,511

to hell for all eternity.

1231
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:26,447
I believe that's
why I'm here.

1232
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:31,385
I will come for
you, all of you.

1233
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:35,522
<i>And as spoken</i>
<i>from his lips</i>
<i>to God's ear,</i>

1234
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:39,793
<i>he will return</i>
<i>for his vengeance.</i>

1235
01:21:39,795 --> 01:21:41,428
[sword sliding]

1236
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:45,966
[Jake's voice, echoing]
It is the inevitable.

1237
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,119
Like the threads?

1238
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:08,322
You do wear
it well.

1239
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:10,457
Thank you.

1240
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,327
It's befitting
of you and habitual,

1241
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:17,064
once again mimicking
the life of a man of God--

1242
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:18,465
and now a priest.

1243
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,267
A great cover,
don't you think?

1244
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:25,940
Free meals.
A cut from
the Sunday basket.

1245
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:29,009
No tax and most of all,

1246
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:33,013
beautiful nuns
and the altar boys.

1247
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:35,249
What could be better?

1248
01:22:35,251 --> 01:22:40,087
I tried the Rabbi
thing, but--

1249
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:41,488
too much to learn.

1250
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:46,427
And that Kaballah, oy!

1251
01:22:46,429 --> 01:22:50,297
You just love giving
religion a bad name,
don't you?

1252
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:54,501
I aim to please.

1253
01:22:54,503 --> 01:22:56,437
Did you get
my calling card?

1254
01:22:56,439 --> 01:23:00,007
[screams]

1255
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:08,048
<i>I kill these two over,</i>

1257
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:15,322

1258
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:24,331
Nobody steals

1259
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:29,903
Yours? It was never
yours to begin
with, Renault.

1260
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:31,438
Renault?

1261
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,542
<i>Anyway--you know</i>
<i>the old saying,</i>

1262
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:40,581

1263
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,429
<i>Have you considered</i>
<i>any of the turning</i>
<i>the other cheek business?</i>

1264
01:23:55,431 --> 01:23:59,099
You know, let
bygones be bygones.

1265
01:23:59,101 --> 01:24:01,001
Not today.

1266
01:24:01,003 --> 01:24:04,538
Pity. Do you remember
the man you made
the mistake

1267
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,341
of calling
the second
greatest swordsman

1268
01:24:07,343 --> 01:24:11,078
<i>in all of the</i>
<i>Mediterranean? Menas</i> !

1269
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:20,220
If she's Menas,

be--Melkon.

1270
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:25,559
<i>Once again.</i>
<i>The advantage of surprise.</i>

1271
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,295
Really? Catch.

1272
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:37,004
Hm. Delicious.

1273
01:24:37,006 --> 01:24:40,074
I see you've returned
to picking apples.

1274
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:42,342
Occupational hazard.

1275
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:46,547
Any of that
blood yours?

1276
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:48,382
T'is now.

01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:50,150
<i>Who the hell is he?</i>

1278
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:52,419
The Shopkeeper
from down the road.

1279
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,188
<i>The shopkeeper?</i>

1280
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:57,491
And how in God's name
is he going to help you?

1281
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:03,097
He wasn't always
a shop keeper.

1282
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:07,201
Hello Menas.
It's been a long time.

1283
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:08,635
Yes, it
has been, Melkon.

1284
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:12,039
Melkon? I thought I was--

1285
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:15,742
Melkon? You
must be shitting me.

1286
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,744
[indistinct]

1287
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:19,413
<i>(Menas)</i>
<i>As you took</i>
<i>your dying breath,</i>

1288
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:21,615
I did not regret your
death, my brother,

1289
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,750
<i>but only the fashion</i>
<i>in which it occurred.</i>

1290
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:25,552
You chose it.

1291
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:28,255
<i>I intended on</i>
<i>killing you honorably.</i>

1292
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:31,291
I robbed myself
of knowing that
I was the best.

1293
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:34,027
<i>And since that night</i>
<i>I've waited in limbo</i>

1294
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:37,564
for 700 years
for this very moment,

1295
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:40,100
to prove that I am
the superior swordsman.

1296
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:42,169
I have no desire
to fight you.

1297
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:46,373
<i>I'm not leaving</i>
<i>you with a choice.</i>

1298
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:50,544
Ah.
My liege.

1299
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,384
<i>Looks like we'll have</i>
<i>ourselves a fair</i>
<i>fight this time.</i>

1300
01:25:57,386 --> 01:26:01,755
Yes, my lord.

1301
01:26:01,757 --> 01:26:05,092
If I've told you once,
I've told you
a thousand times:

1302
01:26:05,094 --> 01:26:08,762
I am not your lord,
I am your brother, Melkon.

1303
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:13,167
[chuckles]
Yes, my lord.

1304
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:14,301
Whatever.

1305
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:36,156
[groaning]

1306
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:39,259
I will not live in
your shadow
any longer.

1307
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:40,694
The only shadow
you live in

1308
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:45,399
is the one you
cast for yourself.

1309
01:26:45,401 --> 01:26:47,801
I shall cut you ten times.

1310
01:26:47,803 --> 01:26:49,603
Once for each
lifetime of excess.

1311
01:26:49,605 --> 01:26:53,207
Or perhaps 700, eh?
One for each year of sin.

1312
01:26:53,209 --> 01:26:56,843

Come and get it!

You betrayed us.

You swore never
to betray us
and then you did!

1319
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:33,814
So Renault,
as promised--

1320
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:35,349
I'm taking
you to hell.

1321
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:37,251
Ah yeah,
that little thing.

1322
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:40,687
Well, I'm certainly fine
when you're having fun.

1323
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:44,391
Are you sure it's been
already 10 lifetimes?

1324
01:27:44,393 --> 01:27:49,696
Because I'm only counting
8 or 9 at the most.

Oh well,

01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:32,806
I just want
to let you know--

1330
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:36,943
each one of my lives
was more decadent
than the last!

1331
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:39,913
I did the unimaginable
to people!

1332
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:41,648
I know.

1333
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:42,582

01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,324
I am better than you.

1336
01:28:50,326 --> 01:28:51,858
Prove it.

1337
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,728
Not with swordsmanship,
but with humility.

1338
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,863
No!

1339
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,711
You only defend,
attack me!

1340
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:16,350
I will not give you
that satisfaction.

1341
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:18,752
I have waited 700
years for this moment.

1342
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:22,489
Now you pick up your sword
and you fight me.

1343
01:29:22,491 --> 01:29:26,360
What are you doing?
Fight me like a man.

1344
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:30,897
Put it in your hand now!

1345
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:36,670
Fighting you will
not make me a man.

1346
01:29:36,672 --> 01:29:39,506
Pick it up. Put
it in your hand
and fight me!

1347
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:40,741
Why won't you fight me?

1348
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:42,642
Because--

1349
01:29:42,644 --> 01:29:44,644
Because you're a coward.

1350
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:48,615
No.

1351
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:52,452
Because I love you.

1352
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:56,790
Remember as children, how
we played together everyday?

1353
01:29:56,792 --> 01:30:00,961
<i>And how our</i>
<i>mother loved us?</i>

1354
01:30:00,963 --> 01:30:02,929
<i>And how she made</i>
<i>us promise to her</i>

<i>that when the day came</i>
<i>that she would leave us,</i>

1356
01:30:04,867 --> 01:30:07,734
that we would
watch over
each other?

1357
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:11,071
Just like brothers should.

<i>and I will now.</i>

If my brother
doesn't love me,

You understand?
Back off!

I'm sorry,
Jake, I'm sorry.

1381

I failed you.

1382

It's not your fault.
It's just destiny.

This has no weight to it.

It's like a butter knife.

Look, I've waited 700
years for this moment.

Point taken but--why
do you have to be so
mean about it?

a great fighter?

01:32:54,536 --> 01:32:59,205
Ah, that is what makes
me a great fighter.

1404
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:02,909
- And chicks dig it.
- Ah.

1405

1407
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:09,583
- My lord.
- Thank you.

1408
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:12,586
Oh, not you, too.

1409
01:33:12,588 --> 01:33:17,090
Well, at least you're
not killing each other.

1410
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,192
And now Renault, old friend.

1411
01:33:19,194 --> 01:33:21,227
T'is your time to die.

1412
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:25,565
So be it, Gregoire.
Ha.

1413
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:28,969
And now your blood,
shall be mine.

1414
01:33:28,971 --> 01:33:30,570
[chuckles]

1415
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:32,872
See you around.

1416
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:35,208
Ahh!

1417
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:43,016
[shouting]

1418
01:33:43,018 --> 01:33:45,051

Jake!

1425
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:32,065
Jake?

1426
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:34,034
Excellent performance,
my lord.

1427
01:34:34,036 --> 01:34:37,704
Excellent performance.
Bravo.

1428
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:40,073
A little over the top.

1429
01:34:40,075 --> 01:34:44,244
But given the circumstance
and no rehearsal--

1430
01:34:44,246 --> 01:34:46,680
How else could
you play it?

1431
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,282
But tell me,
my lord,

1432
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:50,984
how can you be such
a great leader

1433
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:54,888
when you're so dramatic?

1434
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,657
That is what makes me
such a great leader.

1435
01:34:57,659 --> 01:34:59,125
And chicks dig it.

1436
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:04,964
Touche.

1437
01:35:04,966 --> 01:35:07,000
Wait. You're
not shot?

1438
01:35:07,002 --> 01:35:09,636
No, he missed
me by a mile.

1439
01:35:09,638 --> 01:35:13,139
And hey, nice
save by the way.

1440
01:35:13,141 --> 01:35:15,108
<i>Aren't you</i>
<i>guys forgetting</i>
<i>about something?</i>

1441
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,078
The six hacked up
mutilated bodies?

1442
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,346
Six?

1443
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,115
Only a couple
are mine.

1444
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:25,685
Four. Four
were yours.

1445
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:26,853
Four.

1446
01:35:26,855 --> 01:35:30,724
I'm impressed.

1447
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:33,359
I say we pin
it on the priest.

1448
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:38,665
Nice. See, I told you.
You're a leader of men.

1449
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,200
Don't even think
that I'm not
really pissed

1450
01:35:40,202 --> 01:35:41,768
at you at you right now.
I just can't have

You're like Koko
