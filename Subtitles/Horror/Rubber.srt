1
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,322
In the Steven Spielberg movie "E.T.",

2
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:45,283
why's the alien brown?

3
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,620
No reason.

4
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,498
In "Love Story",

5
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,502
why did the two characters
fall madly in love with each other?

6
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:57,796
No reason.

7
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,133
In Oliver Stone's "JFK",

8
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:05,471
Why's the President suddenly
assassinated by some stranger?

9
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:07,974
No reason.

10
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:12,103
In the excellent "Chainsaw Massacre"
by Tobe Hooper,

11
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:15,064
why don't we ever see the characters
go to the bathroom...

12
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:18,777
or wash their hands,
like people doing in real life?

13
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,820
Absolutely no reason.

14
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:24,574
Worse, in "The Pianist" by Polanski,

15
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:28,912
how come this guy has to hide
and live like a bomb...

16
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,832
when he plays the piano so well?

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,209
Once again the answer is "no reason".

18
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,712
I could go on for hours
with more examples.

19
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,380
The list is endless.

20
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:41,008
You probably never gave it a thought.

21
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,427
But all great films,

22
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,388
without exception,

23
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:49,058
contain an important element--
a "no reason".

24
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:50,810
And you know why?

25
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,354
Because life itself...

26
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:56,566
is filled with "no reason".

27
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,611
Why can't we see the air all around us?

28
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,112
No reason.

29
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,116
Why're we always thinking?

30
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:05,575
No reason.

31
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:09,913
Why do some people love sausages
and other people hate sausages?

32
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,417
No fuckin' reason.

33
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:16,295
Come on, don't waste your time
explaining that garbage. Let's go!

34
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,380
Just one minute. Let me finish.

35
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:22,927
Ladies, gentlemen,

36
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,097
the film you're about to see today

37
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,642
is an homage to the "no reason"--

38
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,105
that most powerful element...of style.

39
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,688
Why did they destroy all those chairs.

40
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,858
- Too sad on those.
- Yeah, it's really a pity.

41
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,610
Quiet, please.

42
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,116
Everybody turn around.

43
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,122
Good. Enjoy.

44
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,920
Excuse me, is it going to be in color
or black and white?

45
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,117
It's already boring.

46
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,620
Don't be so negative.
It's just the beginning.

47
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:10,039
It's going to pick up. Just be patient.

48
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:17,755
I hope that's not an old silent film.

49
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,591
I can't hear thing.

50
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,345
Yes, you can hear the wind a little.
If You listen.

51
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:26,473
Somebody see something?

52
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,436
I see a dump, there, straight ahead.

53
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:21,813
RUBBER

54
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,571
Amazing. He just blew up a bottle
without even touching it.

55
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,449
Really? Let me see.

56
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,242
That's odd.

57
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,162
It looks like he has telepathic power.

58
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,831
You mean Psychokinetic?

59
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,292
I don't care about the right word.

60
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,420
Has it just blown up
the bottle with its mind?

61
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:56,172
It is most likely. Yes.

62
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,549
That's awesome. I'm starting to like it.

63
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:02,261
I think the kid is right.
Psychokinetic powers.

64
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,598
Excuse me, but do you have to
comment everything aloud?

65
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:09,686
We are not commenting,
we are only trying to understand.

66
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:12,147
- What do you think of it?
- Nothing.

67
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:17,569
You know you're not allowed to film
the film. That is forbidden by law.

68
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:20,697
It is?

69
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,783
Yeah, they'll put you in jail for that.

70
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:24,535
Jail?

71
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:25,911
That's kidding me?

72
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,040
Yes, she's right, it is piracy.
I'll be careful if I were you.

73
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,544
My wife could not come.
I just wanna show her.

74
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,213
This's piracy anyway.

75
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,760
Thanks for that. I won't in the future.

76
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:21,365
Come on!

77
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,034
Starting again!

78
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,077
Wake up!

79
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,413
Let's go!

80
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:33,962
Jesus, I almost slept awake.
Fuckin' insects!

81
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,631
I was really cold myself.

82
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,883
Quiet!

83
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:39,843
Wake up!

84
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:44,306
Excuse me. Would it be possible
to have some coffee and toast?

85
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,360
Dad, I'm hungry.

86
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,946
Dad?

87
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,376
Where is he?

88
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,961
Straight ahead.

89
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,381
He just woke up.

90
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,632
Oh, thanks.

91
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,093
Anyone got any food?

92
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,372
Oh my god!

93
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,354
Not bad at all.

94
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:50,897
Well, let me see.

95
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:53,650
It is the first time in my life
I identify with a tire.

96
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,945
Stop that. Give me that!

97
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,198
Her ass is not that great,
but I understand.

98
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:02,868
You're hard to pleased.
It is fine with me.

99
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:04,412
Her ass isn't that great

100
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:07,978
but she has quite a wag on it.
You think the tire is gonna get laid?

101
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,251
I would like to see it!
What position do you think?

102
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:12,795
I think she'll start with
a good blowjob.

103
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:13,839
Oh yeah...

104
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:16,236
Jesus, you think you're
gonna shut up some time

105
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,343
and let's watch in
peace? I can't stand it.

106
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:19,969
Come on. Can't you take a little joke?

107
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:24,120
Yes, there is plenty of space. Go
somewhere else if we're bothering you.

108
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:26,727
You should be the ones to move if you
have to laugh so loud, don't you think?

109
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:30,272
No. Why don't you just do like that
cripple, and plug on your walkman

110
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,732
and listen to your music and
then no one bother you any more.

111
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,443
It's not a walkman
It's a medical gismo.

112
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,487
Come on, let's just forget it.

113
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:38,739
Brats.

114
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:43,160
Hi, brats.

115
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,532
Mom, it's me. I'm gonna spend the night
in a motel. I don't wanna try anymore.

116
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,409
See you tomorrow. I love you. Bye.

117
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,358
Anything interesting?

118
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,443
He just switched the channel.

119
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:58,072
Okay. Well...
wake us if we miss anything major.

120
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,907
Good night, everybody.

121
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:04,037
How long before humans start to
eat each other out of hunger?

122
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,788
Don't talk crap. Just sleep.

123
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:07,665
Are you rustlers?

124
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,584
You're gonna let us starve
without doing a thing?

125
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:11,294
I found the blown-off rabbit.

126
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:13,088
You are really so cruel!

127
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:15,966
- I think it's okay to eat, right?
- Idiot!

128
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,717
Can't you see it's fake?

129
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,325
Yes, master.

130
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,038
Very well, master.

131
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,124
Certainly.

132
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,919
I understand perfectly.

133
00:31:32,004 --> 00:31:34,965
I am gonna do it
tomorrow morning without fail.

134
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:37,926
Yeah. First thing in the morning.
You can count on me.

135
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,180
Salutations, master.

136
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:33,985
Morning.

137
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,946
- Can I clean your room?
- Yeah.

138
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,784
Why not?

139
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:20,158
Food!

140
00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:33,547
Food!

141
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:57,113
Animals.

142
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:41,243
Anybody there?

143
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,955
Excuse me,
you want me to come back later?

144
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,640
Fucking weirdoes!

145
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,982
I just saw a live tire.

146
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,528
You get nothing better to do than
come here to start talking rubbish?

147
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,531
I swear... it's true.

148
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,158
Look. He locked himself in room 16.

149
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,578
Did you get homework to do or something?

150
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,414
I am on holidays.

151
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,541
And you don't know what
to do with yourself.

152
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,293
Well you're bugging me.

153
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,128
You don't believe me.

154
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:12,755
You shut up!

155
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,341
Look, here.

156
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:18,678
Get on your bike,
and go get me a pizza, alright?

157
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,972
I give you ten minutes to kill.

158
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:25,059
You go have a look
in room 16 now. Please!

159
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:28,146
Would you get on your bike
and get  me a pizza?

160
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:30,023
Cut this bullshit out?

161
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:31,942
Do it!

162
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:36,571
And don't forget the double toppings!

163
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,638
Here's your double topping, dickhead.

164
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:51,525
And the tire's supposed to float?

165
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:54,528
An inner tube, yes. Not a tire.

166
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:57,740
Really? I'd rather bet
just the opposite.

167
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:04,789
Feeling any better, son?

168
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:08,418
It's burning hard.

169
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:10,587
Daddy, I beg you call a doctor.

170
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:13,089
Come on. Probably just ate too fast.

171
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:15,342
It's gonna be alright. Don't worry.

172
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,344
We all ate too fast.

173
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,349
It's hurting bad, I told you!

174
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,726
Does anybody know anything
about medicine?

175
00:40:24,894 --> 00:40:26,603
No, sorry.

176
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,585
Well, do you happen to
know anything about physics?

177
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:31,442
Would a tire sink or float?

178
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:33,944
It would sink.
We just saw it a minute ago.

179
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:39,158
What is going on?

180
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,751
Oh, damnit! It's a hell.

181
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:48,877
Oh, help me!

182
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:50,295
What's happening to us?

183
00:40:50,463 --> 00:40:51,880
We're poisoned.

184
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:53,632
The turkey was a trap.

185
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,133
A trap?

186
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,805
Oh! Is this how they
they treat the audience?

187
00:40:59,973 --> 00:41:02,975
Don't worry ma'am.
They're not gonna get away with this.

188
00:41:03,143 --> 00:41:04,893
I am still here.

189
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,688
And I want my show.

190
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:11,108
Sure I want my show.

191
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,682
Anybody there?

192
00:41:47,189 --> 00:41:48,397
Tire?

193
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:41,619
...the pool there.

194
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,044
It is right here.

195
00:42:51,214 --> 00:42:52,798
This tire is alive.

196
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:54,800
The tire story again?

197
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:56,719
It doesn't look very alive to me.

198
00:42:56,886 --> 00:43:00,139
I saw the tire get into room 16.

199
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:01,682
He locked himself in.

200
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,393
You know what, I've heard
enough rubbish for the day.

201
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:08,731
Now get the dirty tire out of the pool,
or I'm gonna get really mad!

202
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,944
- Sorry, lieutenant.
- Nothing.

203
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:14,946
But tell me...

204
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:20,535
Don't you find it strange
we can't see the air around us?

205
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:24,039
Why do you say that?

206
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,666
Just like that.

207
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:29,253
No reason.

208
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,721
Okay, kid, listen to me.

209
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:42,308
Nothing to worry about.
It's a perfectly ordinary tire.

210
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:44,644
Yeah, same here.
You see it's not moving.

211
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:48,356
- Well, maybe it drowned.
- Would you stop with this crap, okay?

212
00:43:48,524 --> 00:43:50,108
You're putting me ashamed in front of

213
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:51,422
- a police officer.
- Don't be rough.

214
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:53,716
- There is no need to do that.
- You know, someone died here, okay?

215
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:55,864
We don't joke about things like that.
Do you understand?

216
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:56,802
Yeah, that is true.

217
00:43:56,866 --> 00:44:00,681
I'm not joking. I am sure
that this tire killed Martina.

218
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:02,475
Oh, that is enough! Alright?

219
00:44:02,538 --> 00:44:05,958
I don't want to see you anymore. Okay?
We will settle this tonight. Now squirm!

220
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:08,085
You're getting on my nerves, go!

221
00:44:11,006 --> 00:44:12,047
You're a little jumpy.

222
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,383
Not usually.

223
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:17,845
And take your fucking tire, would you?!

224
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,267
Sorry.

225
00:44:23,852 --> 00:44:26,979
Mr. Hugues, can I ask you some
questions for the investigation?

226
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:28,064
Sure, go ahead.

227
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,775
How was your relationship with Martina?

228
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:34,863
We got along fine, you know,
employer, employee.

229
00:44:35,031 --> 00:44:37,407
- You were satisfied with her work?
- Yeah.

230
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:41,078
Nothing in particular you'd mention
about her behaviour?

231
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,121
No.

232
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,333
Very good.

233
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:50,671
It's been 6 hours, the poison has
had time to take effect. We can stop.

234
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:53,299
- The poison?
- Yes, we poisoned the spectators.

235
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:56,343
And go home now, Mr. Huges.
We don't need you anymore.

236
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:58,804
- Thank you very much.
- I don't understand.

237
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:01,224
It was a pleasure working with you.

238
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:34,425
Everybody, listen!

239
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,094
I have something important to announce.

240
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,558
Pay attention, please.

241
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:51,818
You can all relax.

242
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:53,945
It's over. We're stopping now.

243
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:55,906
Thanks, and...

244
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:58,533
congratulations to all.

245
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:00,254
Great job.

246
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:02,454
What did you mean, Chad?

247
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:06,250
I meant exactly what I just said.
It's over.

248
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:08,168
You can go home with your families now.

249
00:46:08,795 --> 00:46:10,588
It's been a pleasure working with you.

250
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:12,392
You're out of your mind?

251
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:14,300
Why do you want us to go home?

252
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:20,181
Come on.
Stop acting like this is real life.

253
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:24,477
I'm telling you we're done.
There's no one watching anymore, okay?

254
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:26,938
No use going on.

255
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:29,441
Stop.

256
00:46:30,818 --> 00:46:32,694
Finish. We're packing in.

257
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:37,908
But... this is real life, Chad.
We have a dead body over here.

258
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,451
No.

259
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:43,038
Come on. It's not real life.

260
00:46:43,206 --> 00:46:46,208
Look at you, you have a stuffed
toy alligator under your arm.

261
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:53,758
So?

262
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:02,037
Okay. I'm gonna show you something.
Denise, take your gun.

263
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:06,646
- Why?
- Take it, I tell you!

264
00:47:06,814 --> 00:47:08,231
It's an order!

265
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:17,032
- Now point it to me and shoot.
- No way!

266
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:19,284
Doug, you do it.

267
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,461
Don't think. Just shoot.

268
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:35,218
Oh God!

269
00:47:37,346 --> 00:47:38,263
You see?

270
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,349
I don't feel a thing.

271
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:45,437
No pain whatsoever.

272
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:47,981
It's not real.

273
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:49,941
You understand?

274
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,402
Everything is fake.

275
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,239
Shoot again.

276
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:03,748
Now you believe me?

277
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:09,170
This situation is not real.

278
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:13,091
Go home.

279
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:15,218
It's all over.

280
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:16,511
Thanks.

281
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:22,058
What about the cleaning lady?
She's really dead?

282
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:25,020
Open the bag. You might be surprised.

283
00:48:34,948 --> 00:48:36,615
It is a regular corpse.

284
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,826
Give her a good slap, you'll see.

285
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:42,204
Stop your bullshit. She's got no head.

286
00:48:42,372 --> 00:48:43,664
It's not funny.

287
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,000
Shake her up.

288
00:48:50,756 --> 00:48:53,132
So? Nothing happened.

289
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:56,428
She is dead. The body is cold.

290
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:01,975
How cold?

291
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:11,610
One of the spectators
didn't eat the turkey.

292
00:49:12,279 --> 00:49:13,946
He's alive

293
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:16,699
and watching as we speak.

294
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:18,617
Damn!

295
00:49:19,995 --> 00:49:21,787
You sure this is true?

296
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:23,206
Master.

297
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:25,875
You have to go on.

298
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:44,978
Okay. Excuse me, please.

299
00:49:45,146 --> 00:49:46,939
I made a little mistake.

300
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:50,901
Forget everything I just said.

301
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:09,462
I'm sorry.

302
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:14,259
I got a little out of myself.

303
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,595
We're not quite done.

304
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,972
How was your relationship with Martina?

305
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,308
- You're bleeding, lieutenant.
- Don't mind that.

306
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,434
It is nothing.

307
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,770
Let's proceed. Answer my question.

308
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,189
Ah, like I've said,

309
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,359
We got along fine, you know,
employee, employer.

310
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,528
You were happy with her work?

311
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,196
Like I said before, Yeah.

312
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,158
Nothing in particular you'd mention?

313
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,202
No.

314
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,498
Were you in contact with her family?

315
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:48,336
I met her brother once.
He was... ah... rather obese.

316
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,380
We really didn't talk.

317
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,175
Okay. Do you know if Martina was...

318
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,511
in good terms with her obese brother?

319
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,472
Maybe.

320
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:02,392
Do you think the obese brother...

321
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,396
could be directly or indirectly...

322
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,439
involved with Martina's death?

323
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,114
Mr. Huges?

324
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:41,600
"Oh God, the kid was right."

325
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,686
"The killer is a tire."

326
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:23,123
You killed Martina?

327
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:30,797
You're gonna be in trouble
with the police.

328
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,385
You know what the police are?

329
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,514
Do you talk? I mean...

330
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:39,890
Talk... Mm...

331
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:41,976
Me.

332
00:53:42,144 --> 00:53:44,020
Human. Boy.

333
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:47,440
Answer me!

334
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,928
This is what our killer looks like.

335
00:54:16,096 --> 00:54:17,263
A tire?

336
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:19,265
Exactly.

337
00:54:21,393 --> 00:54:25,354
I give you an hour to find him.
It can't have run far.

338
00:54:26,273 --> 00:54:28,316
If you have any questions,

339
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:30,735
It is now or never.

340
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:34,364
What brand of tire?

341
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,492
We don't know yet.

342
00:54:39,328 --> 00:54:41,163
Probably brandless.

343
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:44,041
- Is it worn?
- Yes.

344
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,922
Is it black?

345
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:57,847
It escaped on the road. That way.

346
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:29,088
So...

347
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,883
What might you fancy?

348
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:36,053
Farm chicken?

349
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:40,516
Or maybe potato mashed with olive oil
and mushroom fricassee.

350
00:55:41,852 --> 00:55:43,436
I'll be fine, thank you.

351
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:46,564
Wait until you see the rest.

352
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:51,590
Tuna Tartare on a bed of artichoke

353
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:54,448
with violet flavor and white asparagus.

354
00:55:54,615 --> 00:55:55,782
It's tempting, isn't it?

355
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,161
Okay, you know, I'm not hungry.
So just forget it.

356
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:03,415
Dessert then, perhaps?

357
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:13,801
Chocolate eclairs.

358
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,992
It's... whoof... lovely. How could...

359
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:22,435
Hey, hey, I'm telling you
I'm not hungry, alright?

360
00:56:22,603 --> 00:56:26,106
And you're wasting my time.
Just go away.

361
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:31,194
Come on. You gotta eat something.

362
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:33,488
It is unhealthy.

363
00:56:35,366 --> 00:56:38,264
You can't go on like this.
You can't... You...

364
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:41,246
Have a yoghurt, at least.
Just do that for me.

365
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,084
I just want to watch the end in peace.

366
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:50,172
Wait all you want,
'cause there is no end.

367
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,799
Fine, I'll watch it anyway, alright?

368
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,259
I like it.

369
00:56:57,097 --> 00:56:58,473
What's happening?

370
00:56:58,755 --> 00:57:03,061
What's happening? He's rolling.

371
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:05,355
The cops are chasing him.

372
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:09,234
It's a pretty exciting scene.

373
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:10,861
Is that so?

374
00:57:11,029 --> 00:57:12,321
Where? I can't see.

375
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:14,281
Right there. I see it.

376
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:17,993
- Where?
- Here.

377
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:19,328
Go on.

378
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,479
Then, one day,

379
00:58:24,647 --> 00:58:28,004
My father wanna do something nice for us

380
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:31,561
and he took us on a vacation
to the mountain. But...

381
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:34,823
...because we had no money, we...

382
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:38,338
...couldn't take a skiing. So...

383
00:58:38,745 --> 00:58:40,788
...along with my brother,

384
00:58:40,956 --> 00:58:44,500
we started going on
these walks in the snow.

385
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:47,044
We didn't even have shoes.

386
00:58:48,547 --> 00:58:49,881
It's funny...

387
00:58:54,053 --> 00:58:55,136
And then...

388
00:58:55,888 --> 00:58:59,516
my brother... climbs up a rock,

389
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:02,811
and slips, falls into a crack.

390
00:59:03,354 --> 00:59:04,771
Dumb accident.

391
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:09,777
You surely don't wanna try the eclair?
It's amazing.

392
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:11,320
I'm fine, thanks.

393
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:15,366
where was I?

394
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:16,742
Ah yeah...

395
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:20,746
My brother falls into a crack.

396
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:23,958
and I don't know why,

397
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:26,169
but instead of offer help,

398
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:29,422
I take this some enormous rock

399
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,926
and I smash him into the face with it.

400
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:37,764
And then he stops screaming.

401
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:46,231
Damn.

402
00:59:46,775 --> 00:59:50,486
You have something for stomache?
I ate too fast.

403
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:55,324
Oh, shit!

404
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,335
That stuff was supposed to be
for you to eat!

405
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,383
Oh God, it burns!

406
01:00:13,386 --> 01:00:15,303
I don't want to die!

407
01:00:20,602 --> 01:00:22,269
Help me!

408
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,237
Help me. Oh God, please!

409
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:37,577
Oh, it burns!

410
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm going to die! I don't want to die!

411
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:49,923
Help me please. Help me...

412
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:45,294
You can't do that.

413
01:04:45,462 --> 01:04:46,587
Really?

414
01:04:47,297 --> 01:04:50,841
Well, you can if you want,
but it's against the rules.

415
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:55,429
So what... can I or can't I?

416
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:00,101
Unit 4 central. You receive?

417
01:05:01,061 --> 01:05:03,104
We located the tire.

418
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,357
You receive?

419
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:10,862
I repeat. We located the tire
inside a house.

420
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:12,572
You're on.

421
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:14,991
We receive you, unit 4.

422
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:17,369
What did you mean by "located"?

423
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:20,580
We just saw him.
He's in a house on Belly Ball Road,

424
01:05:20,748 --> 01:05:23,500
watching TV. What should we do?

425
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,794
Stay put. We're on our way.

426
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,017
You alright?

427
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,477
We're gonna neck him.

428
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:27,359
The door just opened. He's coming.

429
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:29,319
Alright, go ahead, read.

430
01:06:30,238 --> 01:06:31,071
Come.

431
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:32,781
Closer.

432
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,265
Come on. Closer. I was expecting you.

433
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,247
Come on. Come here.

434
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,708
Articulate.

435
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:45,586
Come on. Come here.

436
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:48,839
"Come here and kill me,
you son of a bitch."

437
01:06:50,342 --> 01:06:52,343
Come closer and kill me,
you little jerk.

438
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:55,221
Stick to the text. Go on.

439
01:06:55,389 --> 01:06:56,848
Son of a bitch.

440
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:58,683
Come on.

441
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,435
Closer.

442
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:02,687
That's good. He's biting.

443
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:03,897
Go on.

444
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:09,444
Come on.
You know I've been very naughty.

445
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:11,405
You have to punish me.

446
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:14,241
Come. Come punish me.

447
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:16,160
Who wrote this garbage?

448
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:19,204
Don't worry about that. Go on.

449
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,499
You like me?

450
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,710
You think I'm sexy?

451
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,505
Come on, be a good boy,

452
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:30,383
blow my head off, you big slut...

453
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,718
Sorry, I can't read that.

454
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,345
It is too aweful.

455
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:37,265
Get out of the way.
You're gonna ruin everything.

456
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:53,740
Blow my head off, you big slut.
You hear me?

457
01:07:55,994 --> 01:07:59,371
I have a very...
I have been a very naughtly girl.

458
01:07:59,435 --> 01:08:02,750
I need a good thrashing.

459
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:06,817
Come on, now! Go ahead.

460
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,382
Kill me! Go on!

461
01:08:09,591 --> 01:08:11,426
I want to die.

462
01:08:11,593 --> 01:08:12,677
Do it!

463
01:08:12,845 --> 01:08:14,533
I think he suspects something.

464
01:08:14,534 --> 01:08:16,222
I think we should stay
with the woman's voice.

465
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,307
Shit!

466
01:08:17,475 --> 01:08:18,933
Take back the mic.

467
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:24,856
Come on. Go ahead! Go ahead! Come on!

468
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:26,608
Where are we?

469
01:08:26,776 --> 01:08:29,820
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Improvise. Quick!

470
01:08:31,906 --> 01:08:33,407
Hey, blow my head off.

471
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:35,826
What're you wait for?

472
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:38,204
Very good. Go on.

473
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:41,259
Come on, I'm ready! Now!

474
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,491
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you, but...

475
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:58,850
The way I look at it,
this scene makes no sense at all.

476
01:08:59,018 --> 01:09:02,687
And not that as great as we began
with, for at least I understood it.

477
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:05,399
Now, it's uh... it's totally confused.

478
01:09:05,817 --> 01:09:08,610
That's why I took the trouble
to come over this way.

479
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,946
What do you mean?
What don't you understand?

480
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:14,825
What don't I understand is
the bait with the dummy.

481
01:09:14,993 --> 01:09:18,537
It doesn't make sense. And what's
the point? What's the purpose?

482
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:22,062
Can't you see, it's a lure.

483
01:09:22,543 --> 01:09:23,751
There's nothing confusing.

484
01:09:23,919 --> 01:09:26,713
Yeah, I get the lure, okay?
I am not stupid.

485
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,883
What I don't get is why
it takes so many hours.

486
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:32,990
Why don't you just ice the bloody tire?

487
01:09:33,971 --> 01:09:35,388
Now that he's...

488
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:38,391
He's standing in front of
the lure dummy,

489
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:40,560
with a Bazooka-
even better, no, no, listen, listen--

490
01:09:40,728 --> 01:09:45,274
even better, you get one of
your guys with a flamethrower.

491
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:46,839
Just woo!

492
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:50,362
You gotta do something. I mean,
do something, anything.

493
01:09:50,363 --> 01:09:51,198
No, no...

494
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:55,242
The idea was for him to blow up the
dummy himself instead of the dynamite.

495
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:59,789
That way, he will pop
himself off himself, so to speak.

496
01:09:59,957 --> 01:10:01,624
That's brilliant. That's actually
brilliant. What I'm asking...

497
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:03,876
is speed up the action. That's all.

498
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,962
You know? Boom, boom!

499
01:10:06,171 --> 01:10:09,591
Yeah. But then we wouldn't be here
if you've eaten the damn turkey.

500
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:13,094
That's true enough, but...

501
01:10:13,262 --> 01:10:16,546
Listen, we like you told us.

502
01:10:17,225 --> 01:10:19,309
We will try to speed things up now.

503
01:10:20,144 --> 01:10:24,189
- You can go back to your place.
- Thank you.

504
01:10:29,779 --> 01:10:30,946
Asshole.

505
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:32,698
Who's that guy?

506
01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:35,034
Come on, let's get on with it.
I'm exhausted.

507
01:10:35,202 --> 01:10:36,994
Read the last sentence there.

508
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,417
You're nothing but a rubber shit.

509
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:43,710
Once again.

510
01:10:44,128 --> 01:10:46,337
You're nothing but a rubber shit.

511
01:10:47,089 --> 01:10:48,371
Again.

512
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:51,051
You're nothing but a rubber shit.

513
01:11:10,697 --> 01:11:12,365
damn, it didn't work.

514
01:11:31,427 --> 01:11:32,928
May I ask what you intend to do?

515
01:11:33,096 --> 01:11:36,098
I'm gonna blow up this
rubber shit myself. Be done with it.

516
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:37,599
No. You can't do that.

517
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,811
What about the dummy blow-up?

518
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:43,314
You promised man.

519
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:53,449
"The End". Bye.

520
01:11:56,328 --> 01:11:57,704
That's it, ah?

521
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:00,206
That's all you got?

522
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,376
You can't stop here man.

523
01:12:04,295 --> 01:12:06,504
Come on. What kind of racket you wanted?

524
01:12:11,469 --> 01:12:12,970
Wait!

525
01:12:14,013 --> 01:12:18,016
It is not the end.
It's been reincarnated in a tricycle.

526
01:12:18,184 --> 01:12:19,435
Come back!

527
01:12:21,563 --> 01:12:22,897
Wait, wait, wait.

528
01:12:24,858 --> 01:12:28,527
I'm not a character. I'm just watching.

529
01:12:28,904 --> 01:12:30,613
You just stay there.

530
01:12:31,406 --> 01:12:32,824
Stay put.

531
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:35,702
No, stay put!

532
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:37,370
Good.

533
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:06,631
In the Steven Spielberg movie "E.T.",

534
01:20:07,842 --> 01:20:10,301
why's the alien brown?

535
01:20:12,722 --> 01:20:13,930
No reason.

536
01:20:15,016 --> 01:20:16,516
In "Love Story",

537
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:20,562
why did the two characters
fall madly in love with each other?

538
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:22,356
No reason.

539
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:25,567
In Oliver Stone's "JFK",

540
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:29,738
Why's the President suddenly
assassinated by some stranger?

541
01:20:30,824 --> 01:20:32,533
No reason.

542
01:20:33,243 --> 01:20:36,996
In the excellent "Chainsaw Massacre"
by Tobe Hooper,

543
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:40,166
why don't we ever see the characters
go to the bathroom...

544
01:20:40,334 --> 01:20:44,128
or wash their hands,
like people doing in real life?

545
01:20:44,296 --> 01:20:46,089
Absolutely no reason.

546
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:49,718
Worse, in "The Pianist" by Polanski,

547
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:54,097
how come this guy has to hide
and live like a bomb...

548
01:20:54,265 --> 01:20:56,808
when he plays the piano so well?

549
01:20:56,976 --> 01:20:59,019
Once again the answer is...

550
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:00,729
"no reason".

551
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:04,441
I could go on for hours with
more examples. The list is endless.

552
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:07,403
You probably never gave it
a moment's thought.

553
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,030
But all great films, without exception,

554
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:14,410
contain an important element--
a "no reason".

555
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,120
And you know why?

556
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:20,667
Because life itself is made up
of tonnes...

557
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:22,585
of "no reason".

558
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,046
Why can't we see the air all around us?

559
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:26,423
No reason.

560
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,050
Why're we always thinking?

561
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:30,802
No reason.

562
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:35,474
Why do some people love sausages
and other people hate sausages?

563
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:37,559
No fuckin' reason.

564
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:41,605
Come on, don't waste your time
explaining that garbage. Let's go!

565
01:21:41,773 --> 01:21:44,358
Just one minute. Let me finish.
