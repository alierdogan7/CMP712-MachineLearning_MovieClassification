1
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,731
Alright, quiet, come on.

2
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,806
Calm down.

3
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,581
Who wants to see ghosts?

4
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,215
Who wants to see some ghosts??

5
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,254
Ghosts!

6
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,556
Alright, that's better.

7
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,627
First of all, hello, welcome.

8
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:34,894
My name is David Williams, this
is my colleague, Clare McManus.

9
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,134
We are archivists in the
National Film Archive.

10
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,970
Today you're going to see a
series of films, dated from 1895
to 1905.

11
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:48,507
It's worth bearing in mind that
everyone you see in these films
are long since dead

12
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,248
all these people, men, women
and children have vanished off
the face of the earth forever.

13
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,119
So, in a way, it's like
watching real ghosts.

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,258
Alright, alright!

15
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,194
Let's just watch it and see
what you think.

16
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,566
Thanks.

17
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:52,071
Don't worry.. she'll love it.

18
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,178
Hi!

19
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,081
Hey.. nice to see you!
How are you?

20
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,482
This is my wife Alice.

21
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,685
Hi
Hi! Great to meet you!

22
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,687
So nice to finally meet you.
Sorry I couldn't make it the
last time. I was... busy

23
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,692
No no no no... not at all!

24
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,429
So... I'm going to let you go
on in, take a look for
yourselves.

25
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,830
I'll be right here waiting for
you, take as much time as you
need.

26
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,432
Alright, thank you.

27
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,401
Come on then!

28
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,880
Go on; you first.

29
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,727
Are you coming?

30
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,128
No. I'm too nervous.

31
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:54,600
Go on, you go round.

32
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:03,803
I love it!

33
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,361
Alice..

34
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,629
you got a message.

35
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,402
..you got a message

36
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,408
Who is it?

37
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,809
Mam..

38
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,211
Dad

39
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,612
Hey sweetie...

40
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,215
I heard a noise and I woke up
and now I need to go toilet.

41
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,451
I'll go.

42
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,297
Da.. are you afraid of the
dark?

43
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,070
No. Of course not.

44
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,471
Why, are you?

45
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:12,771
No, but there could be
something hiding in the dark

46
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,377
Hmmm.. like what?

47
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,245
Monsters.

48
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,885
Night night. Ok. I love you.

49
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,386
Night Dad, love you.

50
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,554
Do you want to tell me
dinosaurs I can name

51
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,459
Maybe tomorrow.

52
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:33,659
Can you say night night to my
dragon heads?

53
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,031
Good night!

54
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,910
Is he alright?

55
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,915
Yeah, he's fine.

56
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,123
Who was the message from?

57
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,457
Steve.

58
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,432
In work.

59
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,702
Just because he doesn't have a
life he thinks everyone else
should be on a 24 hour call.

60
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,369
I'm sorry. I should have
switched it off earlier.

61
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,183
I love you.

62
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,733
Good night.

63
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,117
What time do you start work?

64
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,918
What's this?
Not 'til 10.

65
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,154
Alright, come on.

66
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,259
Have a good day, sweetheart.

67
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,962
Bye. Love you. You too.

68
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,063
Thank you.

69
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,801
Bye boys!

70
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,736
Bye Mam!

71
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,174
Allosaurus, Bwontosaurus,
T-Rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus,
that's the best one!

72
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,418
Wow! God you're getting so
clever, that's more than I can
name!

73
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,157
Do you think I'd be able to
swim in there?

74
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,293
No way.. no.. it's too deep.

75
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,995
Would you be able to swim in
there?

76
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,696
No..

77
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,364
No It's too deep for me too.

78
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:28,734
Billy... Billy..

79
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,109
Billy! Billy!!

80
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,445
Hey don't go in there, I told
you

81
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,182
A girl in our school saw a
ghost in there

82
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:43,348
Well I don't know about ghosts,
but there could be rats in
there.

83
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:46,985
It's filthy.

84
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,155
Mmm?

85
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,526
Can I throw a stone and see
if a ghost comes out?

86
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,928
Throw a stone?

87
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,329
Alright, just one.

88
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,797
Then we've got to go.

89
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,097
You got one?

90
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,738
Ok?

91
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,140
Can I throw another one?

92
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,309
No! Come on, we're going to be
late.

93
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,647
I'll pick you up later.

94
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,049
Bye Dad!

95
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,386
Have a good day.

96
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,123
I hope you feel better than
you look.

97
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,960
I didn't get much sleep last
night.

98
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:28,260
Mmm!

99
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,762
Why, do I look that bad?

100
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,396
Mmm..

101
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,131
<i>o worse than usual!</i>

102
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,435
Anyway, I probably don't look
much better!

103
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,573
I was up til 4am watching
Cat People and the Curse of
the...

104
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,476
Cat People? It was on?
I love that movie!

105
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,010
Yeah.. I was going to give you
a call, but... I figured you
need your beauty sleep!

106
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,482
Yeah.. very funny.

107
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,886
Listen, I don't mean to spoil
the day with work, but some
films came into the archive;

108
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,856
some from the police archive,
could be interesting.

109
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,259
Yeah

110
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,494
Would you look at them for me?

111
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,228
Sure

112
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,964
Great. Thanks.

113
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,821
Hey.. that's my road.

114
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,573
I had a really strange day
today.

115
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,142
I watched a 1902 film, our
house was in it.

116
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,742
There was a murder here. A man
killed his wife. It happened in
this room.

117
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,681
What?

118
00:11:55,682 --> 00:12:00,018
I wouldn't worry about it.
Horrible things happen in every
old house.

119
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,689
Only these dinosaurs rule
their...

120
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,797
You look amazing Mrs Williams!

121
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,568
Oh!
Thank you, Sophie!

122
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,003
This is my husband, David.

123
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,404
Hi!

124
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,806
Hi.

125
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,641
Sophie used to be the nanny for
the Thompsons, two doors down.

126
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,108
Mam, Sophie never even
heard of Stegosaurus.

127
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:31,550
Well, not everyone knows
about dinosaurs, you know!

128
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,286
OK, make yourself at home,
and help yourself to any food
in the kitchen.

129
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,188
We shouldn't be home too late.

130
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,560
See you tomorrow.

131
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,961
Sleep well.

132
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:49,067
Pleased to meet you.

133
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,146
Alice!

134
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,547
Hi!

135
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,416
Alex is here.

136
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,518
I'm sure you remember David,
my husband.

137
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,920
Hi

138
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,087
You're the, eh, the librarian?

139
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:12,491
The... archivist.

140
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,794
Nice to see you again.

141
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,598
You too.

142
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,533
I'm sure you won't mind if I
borrow your lovely wife for a
couple of moments there's somebody I'd really
like her to meet.

143
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,601
No no, not at all!

144
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,671
I'll get a drink.

145
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,133
Can I help you sir?

146
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,203
Can I get a..

147
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,239
another gin and tonic.

148
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,845
Hi.

149
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,279
I'm sorry about all that.

150
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,781
What was all that about?

151
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,382
Um..

152
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,984
work stuff.

153
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,020
He wanted me to meet this
client, but I didn't want to.

154
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,790
Not tonight.

155
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,492
I thought he was the client.

156
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,893
Yes...

157
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,294
he is.

158
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,696
But he wanted me to meet
another one.

159
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:02,501
A colleague of his.

160
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,804
Let's dance.

161
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:07,839
I'm just going to finish this.

162
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,263
I love you.

163
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,829
Whoa!

164
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,163
Sorry! I couldn't resist.

165
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,935
You alright?

166
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,336
Yeah.

167
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,737
You look pale.

168
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,139
No I'm alright.

169
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,540
Yeah?

170
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,942
Paler than usual, even.

171
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,343
Um..

172
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,816
I have the last 7 or 8 of those
donated films lined up in the
screening room, take a look?

173
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,884
Yeah, sure.

174
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,487
Twinkle twinkle little star,
how I wonder what you are.

175
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:09,527
Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky..

176
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,792
Kiss!

177
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,061
Bye boy.

178
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,929
Bye Mum.

179
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,597
Wait for your Dad, Billy!

180
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,471
Hey, don't work late tonight.

181
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,872
Come straight home.

182
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,274
Why?

183
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,510
What's wrong?

184
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,212
I won't be too late, I
promise.

185
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:43,688
Bye.

186
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:31,736
Alice!

187
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,943
Alice!

188
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,521
Hello?

189
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,825
Dad! I'm still at school,
are you collecting me?

190
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,362
Dad, did you forget about me?

191
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,797
I just lost track of time.

192
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,331
I'm sorry.

193
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,836
Adam and me were the only ones
left.

194
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,771
Adam said a gowilla could beat
a winosaurus in a fight, is
that true?

195
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:16,114
No.

196
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,610
The master wants you.

197
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,282
The master wants you.

198
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,502
David...

199
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:34,906
please..
don't..

200
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,343
I don't want to...

201
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,179
David...

202
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,516
please..
don't..

203
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,920
I don't want to die

204
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,959
Hi, it's Alice here, sorry I
missed your call.

205
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,497
If you want to leave your name
and number I'll get back to you
as soon as possible. Thanks.

206
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:32,423
Detective McNamara.

207
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,137
So, when did you last see her?

208
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,738
Em.. yesterday morning.

209
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,239
We said good bye, I took
Billy, my son, to school.

210
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,511
And has she stayed out all
night before?

211
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,912
No.

212
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,314
No, never.

213
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,054
She said she was working late
last night, but I asked a work
colleague of hersand she said Alice left
around about five.

214
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,589
Did you have an argument?

215
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,990
No.

216
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,391
You sure?

217
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,560
Yeah.

218
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,129
You been in touch with her
family and friends?

219
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,531
Yes.

220
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:14,932
And they've heard nothing from
her?

221
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,334
No.

222
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,406
Ok..

223
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,144
Hair colour?

224
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,290
Some of them are a little old.

225
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,258
That's all I could find.

226
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,929
Dad..

227
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,399
when will mummy be coming back?

228
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,403
I told you... she'll be home
soon. Don't worry.

229
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,811
Pretty..

230
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,882
Hey.

231
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,249
Hiya.

232
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,721
Is there any news?

233
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,492
How's Billy?

234
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,894
Yeah, he's fine.

235
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,463
I put him to bed about an hour
ago.

236
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,998
He wanted to sleep in your
room.

237
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,438
Do you know there's black
stuff on your hands.

238
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,174
They took my fingerprints to
eliminate me.

239
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,642
In case there's an
investigation.

240
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,647
Em.. I put Billy to bed about
an hour ago.

241
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,419
He wanted to sleep in your
room.

242
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,487
He's fine. All day. We get on
really well!

243
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,693
He's a great kid, I really
like him.

244
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,795
I get to know everything about
dinosaurs!

245
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:24,996
Yeah!

246
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,867
I'd better go.

247
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,469
Yeah.

248
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,870
Thanks.

249
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,271
Yeah.

250
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:39,877
See you in the morning.

251
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:27,291
Billy... Billy! What are you
looking at?

252
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,463
Come here...

253
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,468
I had a dream about Mammy.

254
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,304
I miss her.

255
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:18,609
Man came forward yesterday
claiming to be your wife's
lover.

256
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,615
Says he was with her the
night she disappeared.

257
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,453
They've been seeing each other
for about a year.

258
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,759
You know anything about that?

259
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,127
No.

260
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,301
Well, according to him,
she was planning to leave you.

261
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,703
That's impossible.

262
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,104
She loves me.

263
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,506
She has a lover, David.

264
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,975
He's lying!

265
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,745
Well, several of her friends
have backed him up.

266
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:59,016
By all accounts, she was in
love with the bloke, and he with
her.

267
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,396
Sorry.

268
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,632
Fucking acid reflux.

269
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,904
Total fucking pain in the
arse.

270
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,042
Want one of these?

271
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,377
No.

272
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,048
I've got a very weak stomach,
David.

273
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,857
You didn't kill her, did you?

274
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:40,157
You've no right to be asking
me these things.

275
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:44,628
I love, I love my wife.

276
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,267
I'd never, I'd never do
anything to hurt her.

277
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:57,641
Never.

278
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,109
Are you asking her lover
these questions, are you?

279
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,511
Yeah.

280
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,912
You asking him if he killed
her?

281
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,948
Yeah.

282
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,482
He's got an alibi.

283
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,620
His boss called just as she
was leaving his house,

284
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,689
they both heard her insist
on going home by herself

285
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:19,196
and then stayed on the phone
for over an hour, so it's cast
iron mate!

286
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,169
Uh..

287
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,372
people always suspect the
husband.

288
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,841
Do you know why that is?

289
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,811
Cause it's always the husband.

290
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:37,848
Every fucking time.

291
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,476
Is this your wife?

292
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,112
This your wife, Alice
Williams?

293
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,017
Yes.

294
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:23,821
Yes, it's my wife.

295
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,089
There was no evidence of foul
play or assault.

296
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,895
She drowned.

297
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,229
She must have fallen in.

298
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,101
It was an accident?

299
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,769
Yes.

300
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,939
I think so.

301
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,943
One of the heels of her shoe
had snapped off, which we think
may have caused her to fall in.

302
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,946
So in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary,

303
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:52,116
we have to conclude
that it was an accident, yes.

304
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,856
Do you agree?

305
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,760
You did know she was pregnant?

306
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,170
Very sorry for your troubles.

307
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,238
Thank you.

308
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:54,111
Nana.

309
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:58,148
Ohh!

310
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,485
She loved you.

311
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,922
You know that, don't you?

312
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,693
Yes?

313
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,095
Yes?

314
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,496
She loved you.

315
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,163
More than anything else in the
whole world.

316
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,136
Yes.

317
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:19,436
Oh Billy!

318
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,241
Billy.

319
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,642
Billy!

320
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:31,115
Come on, go with Clare, ok?

321
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,820
How's he doing?

322
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,556
Yeah, he's alright.

323
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,058
Children are strong.

324
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:41,592
They are stronger than most
adults, even.

325
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:49,366
Of course, they don't really
understand, do they?

326
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,070
Maybe I should take him for a
while.

327
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,075
It might be good for him.

328
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:01,044
I think Alice would have liked
that.

329
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,214
He should be around another
woman.

330
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,417
A mother figure.

331
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,052
We've got Sophie living with
us now...

332
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,587
Billy's nanny...

333
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:16,627
I think it's best if stays
home with me.

334
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,767
Did you hear about Alex?

335
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,036
Alex?

336
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,871
Alice's boyfriend.

337
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:28,238
Apparently he's taken
Alice's death very badly.

338
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,378
He's completely devastated.

339
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,513
They say he need to go into a
hospital.

340
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,615
To recover.

341
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,784
Yes.

342
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,018
I couldn't give a shit.

343
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,923
Do you understand me?

344
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,192
I couldn't care less, I have
my son.

345
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,331
A lot of people loved her.

346
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:59,603
I loved her.

347
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,940
I have to go.

348
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:10,113
Just say goodbye to Billy.

349
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,584
It's been a long day.

350
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,399
You alright?

351
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,537
I lied.

352
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,542
I, eh, I lied to the police.

353
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,244
I did know about that guy in
the house

354
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,678
Oh...

355
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,681
em...

356
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,417
it doesn't really matter now
anyway, does it.

357
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,152
It was an accident.

358
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,356
The thing is...

359
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,692
on the night she disappeared

360
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,794
I went to his house,

361
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,729
that guy, and I went in after
them

362
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,434
and I saw them together in bed.

363
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:11,308
I didn't do anything.

364
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,743
You know, I could have done, but
I didn't. I just left.

365
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,411
They didn't even see me.

366
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,380
On the way home I felt..

367
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:20,217
so sick, I just had to go to
the public toilets

368
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:20,450
beside the canal and I just
threw up, everywhere,

369
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:28,692
and I remember, I was just
being sick, and I looked up,

370
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,695
and there was someone looking
over the cubicle wall at me.

371
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,430
It was a man.

372
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,667
I managed to get to the door,
and just before I blacked out

373
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:40,237
I swear I saw him with his
hands around her throat,

374
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,607
and he was, he was trying to
kill her.

375
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,811
He was killing her, and I
couldn't move, I couldn't do
anything.

376
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,216
And then when she didn't come
back home the next day..

377
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,253
I mean, what I seen was real..
Clare...

378
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,654
it was really real.

379
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,389
Then you need to tell the
police.

380
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:04,094
Tell em what, what I told you,
I don't even,

381
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,463
I don't even know
what the man looked like.

382
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,864
It doesn't matter, tell them
anyway

383
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:08,365
Once I tell them I followed
Alice into that house, that is
it.

384
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,036
Alright?

385
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,971
They'll, they'll just,
they'll just think it was me.

386
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,307
What are you going to do?

387
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,343
I have to find him first.

388
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:22,346
I just have to.

389
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,799
David!

390
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,635
David!

391
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,037
What?

392
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,405
The old camera.

393
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,241
Eh, no, sorry.

394
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,642
I'll do it now.

395
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,044
It's ok.

396
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:35,445
Do it in the morning.

397
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,880
What's this?

398
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:40,350
It's just..

399
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,487
eh, just..

400
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,990
unsolved crimes.

401
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:47,157
Murders that happened
in the city around the canal.

402
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,363
I found it online.

403
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,898
Just going through it.

404
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:58,034
See if I can find
similarities.

405
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,937
David.

406
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:01,471
You should be taking time to
grieve, not thinking about stuff
like this.

407
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,477
I'll find something.

408
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,145
Yeah, I just have to keep
looking, that's all.

409
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:26,363
Dad, look what we did!

410
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,798
Wow! It's great!

411
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,200
I hope you don't mind.

412
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,601
I know how busy you are.

413
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,603
No, course not.

414
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,005
I totally forgot.

415
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,408
Dad, lift me up, so I can
put the angel on top.

416
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,709
You want to put the
angel on top, do you?

417
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:46,082
Up right the top.

418
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:46,449
You ready?

419
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:51,555
Wherever you want..

420
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:57,594
1-2-3.. come on, reach!

421
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:30,360
Sorry for disturbing you.

422
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,596
I was thinking that we could
make a real effort with the
decorations and stuff this year.

423
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,767
I think it would be good for
Billy.

424
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:41,304
What do you think? I could
buy more lights for the stars.

425
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:41,871
And yes, I thought I could
decorate all the other rooms
and stuff..

426
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:48,411
make it, like, really
Christmassy.

427
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,813
Yeah.

428
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,514
Yeah.
That sounds a good idea.

429
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,882
Are you alright?

430
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:59,623
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

431
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,162
Mr Williams.

432
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,798
Night Sophie.

433
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,392
Do you want us to move?

434
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:15,565
No it's ok, stay where you
are.

435
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:51,501
Hello..

436
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,338
is someone there?

437
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,268
Sophie?

438
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,273
Sorry!

439
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,176
Ah..

440
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:07,577
sorry.

441
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,079
Sorry..

442
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,983
Look, could you come
to my room for a second?

443
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,890
Why?

444
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:25,061
Eh, just for a second.

445
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,471
Don't you... listen! It's
really faint.

446
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,872
What is it?

447
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:38,975
Just listen.

448
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:42,278
You hear it?

449
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,615
I can't hear anything.

450
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,420
No it's stopped.

451
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,388
There's something behind
there.

452
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,790
Maybe it's just a rah.

453
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,191
No no.

454
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,495
It's not a rat.

455
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,798
I can't hear anything.

456
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:04,000
What can you hear?

457
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,603
It's whispering like someone's
praying.

458
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,041
Maybe it's just from the house
next door.

459
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,243
No...

460
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:19,382
the walls are too solid.

461
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,784
Dad what are you doing I was
asleep?

462
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,520
Billy..

463
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,921
Billy go to bed.

464
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,322
It's alright.

465
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,724
It's nothing.

466
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:29,259
Everything's ok.

467
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,628
Take him to bed, will you.

468
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:34,864
Come on.

469
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,568
We have to go to bed.

470
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,969
I want to stay.

471
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:45,742
What's Dad doing?

472
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,213
What's wrong??

473
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,321
Billy, go to your room, get
dressed.

474
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,457
You and Sophie are getting out
of here.

475
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:07,857
I'm just going to put the belt
on you.

476
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,596
There we go.

477
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:14,998
Alright, I'll see you
tomorrow.

478
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,033
I love you.

479
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,107
I'm not sure about this.

480
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:26,342
I'm sorry, sorry about this.

481
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,911
You're just going to have to
trust me. Alright?

482
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,080
It's not safe here, It's not
safe for you and Billy.

483
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,049
Everything is paid for at
the hotel, they're expecting
you

484
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,654
OK

485
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,555
You can buy anything
you want on room service.

486
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,957
I'll see you tomorrow.

487
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,358
Thanks.

488
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,829
Yeah.

489
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,600
Come on...
come on...

490
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,038
Ok, it's just coming up...

491
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,307
Ok there..

492
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:00,877
there it is, you see it?

493
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:01,811
Yes..

494
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:02,979
I see it.

495
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,414
There's someone there.

496
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:05,248
Ok, there's more..

497
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,683
just wait...

498
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,450
and there...
there...

499
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,087
you see his outline?

500
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:11,554
It's hard to tell, it could
just be a shadow

501
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,625
Oh come on, there's someone
there.

502
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:16,759
Maybe. It's really hard to
tell

503
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:23,032
Tell me you believe this ok?

504
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,434
Believe what?

505
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:28,071
This is the man that killed
Alice.

506
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:31,040
This is the same man that I saw
on the night that she was
murdered.

507
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,442
What do you mean?

508
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:33,176
I think there's ghosts in my
house.

509
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,850
David!...

510
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:41,751
I know this sounds crazy,
believe me, I know how fucking
crazy this sounds, but I've seen things, I've
heard things, it's the only
rational explanation

511
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,389
Hmmm..

512
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,824
I don't think it is!

513
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,225
Yes it is!

514
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,626
Ok, ok, wait until you hear
this.

515
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,762
In the 1930's they held
seances in my house,

516
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,964
the people said they saw a
shadowy figure,
a shadowy figure

517
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,366
It's a coincidence, that's all.

518
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,502
The previous owner, right, the
estate agent told us it was an
old lady that went senile,

519
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,741
but it wasn't.

520
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,876
They lied to us.

521
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:08,711
She was a young woman who tried
to burn her house down while her
family was asleep.

522
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,549
Now her son died in the fire,
but she swore she didn't do
it.

523
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,488
Like me with Alice.

524
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,556
She said it was the demon.

525
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,392
She said a man she couldn't see
tried to rape her.

526
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,496
She said he was a demon
who lived behind the walls.

527
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:27,897
The walls, Clare.

528
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:29,298
Stop for a moment.

529
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,368
Stop for one moment.

530
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:36,372
Will you just think about what
you're saying.

531
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:40,009
You think I'm having a
nervous breakdown don't you?

532
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,379
Well maybe I am.

533
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,986
No.

534
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,387
Well maybe...

535
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,555
You're just exhausted.

536
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,326
Ok?

537
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,662
Yeah.

538
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:13,409
Billy?

539
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,946
Sophie?

540
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:20,016
Billy can you hear me?

541
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,951
Dad why did you not come to
see us today?

542
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,820
I'm sorry.

543
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,022
I wanted to, I just wasn't
feeling very well.

544
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:29,325
Can you come in and see us
tomorrow?

545
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,726
Yeah.

546
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,963
Yeah, promise.

547
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,364
What have you had to eat?

548
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:35,698
We had burgers, chips,
icecream and coke for dinner.

549
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,837
Wow..

550
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,841
My tummy is big, look how fat
I am Dad!

551
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,575
Billy is Sophie back in the
room with you?

552
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:23,880
No she's still in the shower.

553
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,817
Billy I want you to move
the laptop around, ok?

554
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,654
Just move the laptop around so
I can see the rest of the room,
go on.

555
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:34,156
Please?

556
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,091
Keep moving...

557
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,526
keep moving the laptop.

558
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,160
That's it.
Good boy.

559
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,296
keep moving some more...

560
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,098
that's it...

561
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:43,833
just need to see the...

562
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,501
the room.

563
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:49,138
What is that?

564
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,080
Billy...

565
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,482
BILLY!

566
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,883
BILLY GET OUT OF THE ROOM!!

567
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,285
BILLY!!!!

568
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:07,423
Ahhh!!

569
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:53,869
How did you get here so fast?

570
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,172
Mr Williams?

571
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,813
I'm not sure if I can work
here anymore.

572
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,783
I don't know what's going on.

573
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,184
And..

574
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,621
if it wasn't for Billy I think
I'd leave right now.

575
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:48,958
I understand.

576
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:55,131
Yeah you're right, you should
go.

577
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,370
I can't guarantee your safety
anymore and...

578
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,411
it's not safe to be around us.

579
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:09,912
I don't want to leave Billy
behind...

580
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,718
but I really don't think
you're well, Mr Williams.

581
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,992
Maybe if you told me what was
going on I could understand or I
could help.

582
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:30,332
Please Sophie, you must go
tomorrow.

583
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,136
You better sleep in here with
us tonight.

584
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,106
I'll take the floor, you can
have the bed.

585
00:59:40,544 --> 00:59:41,944
No it's alright.

586
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,345
I'll be ok.

587
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,747
No.

588
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,148
No, no, please.

589
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,551
You won't.

590
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:49,819
Mr Williams, I want to talk to
you about this again in the
morning.

591
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:53,622
About me leaving, I mean.

592
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,995
Yeah.

593
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,664
Goodnight.

594
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,473
Come on...

595
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,477
Come on...

596
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,146
No..

597
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,163
No!... what are you doing??

598
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,564
Arrhhh!

599
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,633
Just come down the stairs..

600
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:20,936
Let me out!

601
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,474
Let me out!!

602
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:29,745
Mr Williams!!

603
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,184
Where's Dad, who's in the
house?

604
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:40,889
I don't know...

605
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,926
No-one

606
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,868
Mr Williams, let me out.

607
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:56,171
Let us out..

608
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,809
Billy's afraid..

609
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:07,650
I've checked everywhere

610
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:10,953
Dad!

611
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,921
Me and Billy..

612
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,456
were following somebody
outside...

613
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,660
Ok then I heard you screaming.

614
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:21,163
They're trying to separate us.

615
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:21,363
Did you see anyone up there?

616
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:26,268
Did you?

617
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,437
Come on Billy!

618
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,439
No..

619
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,576
Billy's staying with me.

620
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,846
Sophie!...

621
01:03:57,634 --> 01:04:01,537
Billy...

622
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,374
Do you ever see other people
in the house?

623
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,482
Billy..

624
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,651
if you see someone,
you know you have to tell me?

625
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:17,052
Did you?

626
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,254
Are you sure?

627
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:23,892
Where's Sophie?

628
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,865
She left this morning.

629
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,968
She's not coming back.

630
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:44,747
Billy..

631
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:46,148
do you see that woman?

632
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:48,684
Where?

633
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:50,085
There...

634
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,954
you see, she's hiding in the
long grass?

635
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:55,023
I don't see anyone.

636
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:11,507
Are we going to see my teacher
today?

637
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,111
No.

638
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,081
Not today.

639
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,790
Billy..
Billy get back.

640
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,224
Go on. Get back...

641
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,193
go... go hide behind the wall.

642
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,270
Go on...

643
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,671
turn around...turn around,
count to 10.

644
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,072
Ok?

645
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,073
One...

646
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:45,941
two...
go on...

647
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:49,111
1...

648
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,949
2...

649
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:00,088
...4...

650
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,701
...10!

651
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,709
Is this a game of hide and
seek, can I open my eyes now?

652
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,555
Clare...

653
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,957
David..

654
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,358
you Ok?

655
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,793
Hi, Billy!

656
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:40,262
Hi!

657
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:41,663
Eh..

658
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,065
I need to develop this.

659
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,733
What is it?

660
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,401
It's nothing.

661
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,705
Just let me develop it,
it won't take me long.

662
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:49,938
You have to tell me what it is
first.

663
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:53,609
Please, Clare, don't make me
beg.

664
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,846
I need to see this.

665
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,518
Please.

666
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,486
Ok.

667
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,255
But it'll be a couple of days
though.

668
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,656
No.

669
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,424
No, I need to see it today...

670
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:10,826
em...

671
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,227
well...

672
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,795
I need to see it now.

673
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,564
It's fully booked in here.

674
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:15,931
Ok, I'll get it done, promise.

675
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,537
I'll even drop it down to you
when it's done, Ok?

676
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,341
Look...

677
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:29,444
I've been thinking...

678
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:29,878
maybe you should talk to
someone?

679
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:36,652
A bereavement counsellor or
something.

680
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:39,888
Just...

681
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:48,130
think about it, Ok?

682
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:58,840
If anyone walks here tonight,
we'll see their footsteps

683
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,342
It's like snow!

684
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:01,743
Can I have a go?

685
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,445
Yeah!

686
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:07,249
Now no one can get in without
us knowing.

687
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:31,673
You're like me

688
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,294
What's with all the powder,
Dave?

689
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,763
It's flour from the kitchen.

690
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,165
Oh..

691
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,566
is that right?

692
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,501
What's with all the flour,
are you making a cake?

693
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,637
What do you want?

694
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,038
Get your clothes on.

695
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:10,839
You're coming with me.

696
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:15,644
We found a hammer in the canal,
with your fingerprints on it.

697
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,015
A hammer that belonged to your
wife's lover.

698
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,255
He says it went missing
the night she disappeared.

699
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:27,989
Can you explain that?

700
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:33,161
There was a murder in my house
in..

701
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,997
in 1902.

702
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,566
What...

703
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,333
You could look all of this is
up; and a man killed his whole
family.

704
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,638
You understand me...

705
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,640
and I think he was the one who
did it.

706
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:46,241
I have proof, I've captured
something on film.

707
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,046
It's a ghost.

708
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:56,084
You can see it in a few days.

709
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,087
As the senior welfare officer I
have no choice but to recommend
his case to social

710
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,194
services and recommend that
the child is taken into care.

711
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,764
Isn't that a little harsh?

712
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,365
Mr Williams has just lost his
wife.

713
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:14,970
His symptoms are clearly
part of a grieving process.

714
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,437
Are locking nannies in
cupboards and hearing voices
behind walls part of the
grieving process?

715
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,546
It was only one nanny and
people react differently to the
death of a loved one

716
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:32,547
and, by the way, this is the
same nanny that Mr Williams
caught smoking drugs in her
room, so...

717
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,003
No way!

718
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,404
No way!!

719
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,973
Yes.

720
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,243
Yes, we can do that.

721
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,612
We'll wait for the report back
from the psychiatrist and then
we'll see what to do after that.

722
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,554
I'm not going to a
psychiatrist.

723
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:07,022
There's nothing wrong with me.

724
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,423
You have to.

725
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:09,457
We agreed to it.

726
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,892
You did.
I didn't.

727
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:11,927
I'm not going.

728
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:14,796
I have to get back to Billy

729
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,907
Dad...

730
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,109
who are those men?

731
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,511
They're the police.

732
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:34,649
Don't look.

733
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:45,560
Don't look.

734
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,032
Is there somebody outside?

735
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,670
No.

736
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,606
Dad..

737
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,712
What?

738
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,680
You'd never leave me, would
you?

739
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,850
No.

740
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:12,854
Of course not.

741
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:16,524
What if you die like Mammy,
what would happen to me then?

742
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,095
I'll never leave you, Billy.

743
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:23,899
Never.

744
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,537
And we'll always be together,
you and me.

745
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,238
Ok?

746
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:36,878
Right now, close your eyes.

747
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:16,931
Did you watch it?

748
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,766
No.

749
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,070
Would you...

750
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:27,275
would you watch it with me?

751
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:27,642
I'm afraid to watch it on my
own.

752
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,149
Ok.

753
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,550
Ok.

754
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:35,917
Come watch on TV...

755
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:56,938
David... do you
remember calling me last night?

756
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:00,375
Last night?
No.

757
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,178
You did.

758
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:09,284
You were delirious, I
hardly recognised your voice.

759
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,288
You were crying.

760
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,095
You said you wanted to
tell me something about Alice.

761
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:24,799
That wasn't me.
I didn't call you.

762
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:29,237
Sit down.

763
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:39,681
If you did hurt her, if you
did do it, maybe you should
just...

764
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,956
get it over with...
go to the police.

765
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,230
I'll go with you if you want
me to.

766
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,899
I'll tell them what a good
person you are.

767
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:04,372
I'll help you.

768
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,041
Clare they sacrificed children
in this room...

769
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:10,411
don't you know?

770
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:15,984
David what are you talking
about?

771
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:19,120
Baby's blood is the most
powerful, you see?

772
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:22,890
They would carry the bodies
from here through the sewer and
dump them in the canal.

773
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,529
In the canal!

774
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,797
They...
they thought of everything...

775
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,232
David, stop it, stop it!

776
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:31,699
Stop it...
look at me!

777
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,906
Did you kill Alice?

778
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:46,047
just say you didn't do it...
look me in the eye

779
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:48,383
Say you didn't do it.

780
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:48,716
Say you didn't do it, please!

781
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:52,720
Just tell me!

782
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,022
Whatever you say, I'll believe
you.

783
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,059
Whatever you say, anything you
say, I'll believe you.

784
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:04,399
I'll believe you...

785
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,800
I'll believe you...

786
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,435
Just tell me...

787
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,175
just tell me...

788
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:14,809
just tell me...

789
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,930
Just watch this.

790
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,166
Then you'll understand.

791
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,100
Yeah, we'll...
we'll watch this.

792
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:01,356
Ok there she is...
do you see her?

793
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:01,856
She's moving...

794
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,259
you see?

795
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:08,830
David...

796
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,968
there's nothing there.

797
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:16,437
Just wait...
there's more.

798
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,243
Ok... there...
there!

799
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:22,343
Do you see, there, look!

800
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:24,078
What is that there?

801
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:26,481
She's moving toward us,
do you see her?

802
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,352
What is it?

803
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,226
Yes...
I see som...

804
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,694
You see it??

805
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:39,961
I see something

806
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,330
I told you I'm telling the
truth..

807
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:42,964
What is it??

808
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:46,334
I'm not going insane!

809
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:47,402
Do you understand me...

810
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:48,603
look there!

811
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,071
What is it??

812
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:56,411
David...

813
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:57,645
David, turn it off!

814
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:58,246
Turn it off, what is it??

815
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,549
What is it??

816
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,223
David please!!
No!!

817
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,198
Nooo!!!!

818
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:22,603
Stop!!!

819
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:26,240
Arrrrghhhh!!!

820
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:40,755
What's up then?

821
01:22:42,224 --> 01:22:43,624
It wasn't me.

822
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:48,629
We saw him go into the house
with a woman, then we heard her
screaming. What have you done, David?

823
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,063
What have you done?

824
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:53,768
I didn't do it!

825
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:59,240
Open the door, David!

826
01:22:59,241 --> 01:22:59,907
Mr Williams...

827
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:01,342
David!
Open the door!

828
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,443
Open the fucking door, David.

829
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,558
Upstairs!

830
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:22,597
David!

831
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,031
Come back!

832
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,166
Stop!

833
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:26,934
David!

834
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,838
Stop it...
stop it...

835
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:35,042
Look at me..

836
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,952
look!
Right, there she is.

837
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,320
There!
She's moving.

838
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:48,923
David..

839
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,325
there's nothing there..

840
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,828
There..
she's moving towards us...

841
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:54,328
DO YOU SEE HER??

842
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:56,731
Look!

843
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:57,732
I want you to see her.

844
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:59,166
You can see her!!

845
01:23:59,167 --> 01:23:59,367
There's nothing there!!

846
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:23,591
Go that way!!

847
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:37,471
The master wants her.

848
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,508
Give her to him.

849
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,260
I couldn't help it..

850
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,262
You're a fucking whore!

851
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,663
David, I love you!

852
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,231
You're a fucking whore!

853
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:05,633
That's what you are!

854
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,301
I didn't mean for this to
happen.

855
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,070
I need to leave, I need to
take Billy with me..

856
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:10,538
..No no, David, I'm sorry...

857
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,242
No no....

858
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:16,644
Fucking bitch!

859
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,414
David...

860
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:26,220
No, David!!

861
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,621
Da...

862
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,023
David!!

863
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:30,424
David!!!

864
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:31,826
Euurgh!!

865
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,227
DAVID!!!

866
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:34,628
Hellp!

867
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,063
David!

868
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,900
Aghh!

869
01:26:02,124 --> 01:26:04,558
Alice...

870
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:10,031
Alice...

871
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,551
David....

872
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:34,422
Aggghhhh!!

873
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:40,728
Arrrgghhh!

874
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:42,129
Arrrggghhhh!!

875
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:16,430
Arrrgghhh!

876
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,280
You alright?

877
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,064
When's the first viewing,
then?

878
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,866
Next Monday.

879
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:55,636
Will that give you enough
time? Oh yes yes,

880
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:57,404
the house will be cleared
by next Friday. I don't want time wasters.

881
01:27:57,405 --> 01:28:00,040
I only want serious people
looking at this house.

882
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:00,474
Of course.
I feel the same.

883
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:07,381
Nana, can I go inside and get
my dinosaur book?

884
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:08,282
Yes, yes - don't be long,
we're going now.

885
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,723
I have a list of appointments
already lined up for next week.

886
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:41,348
Billy...

887
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:41,615
Billy, over here!

888
01:28:44,186 --> 01:28:45,452
It's Daddy...

889
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,827
I'm here with your mother.

890
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:57,198
Do you miss us?

891
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:06,140
Do you want to stay here with
us?

892
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,251
Do you want to stay here with
us forever?

893
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:20,654
I love you Billy.

894
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:24,291
I love you.
