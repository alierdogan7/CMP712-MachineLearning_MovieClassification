1
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:33,426
That night, penetrating deep into
the heart of Transylvania...

2
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:37,061
...Professor Abronsius was unaware
that he was on the point...

3
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,176
...of reaching the goal
of his mysterious investigations.

4
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:45,178
In the course of which he had journeyed
throughout central Europe...

5
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:50,980
...accompanied by his one and only
faithful disciple, Alfred.

6
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:56,291
A scholar and scientist
whose genius was unappreciated...

7
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,826
...Abronsius had given up all
to devote himself body and soul...

8
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,965
...to what was, to him, a sacred mission.

9
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:06,465
He had even lost his chair
at Kurnigsburg University...

10
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:11,972
...where for a long time his colleagues
used to refer to him as ´´The Nut. ´´

11
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,791
Welcome!

12
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,558
Welcome!

13
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:48,035
Professor.

14
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,769
Quick, quick!

15
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,394
-Hurry, hurry!
-Here!

16
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,124
-No, no, over here.
-Don`t push me!

17
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,495
Not against the stove,
because of gangrene!

18
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,569
Hot beer!
Hot beer and cinnamon!

19
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,232
Gently.
lt will break like glass.

20
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,865
-A mustard bath for his feet!
-His nose as well. His nose as well.

21
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:31,207
-No! Not the nose!
-Stand him up! Stand him up!

22
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,372
No!

23
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,660
Rebecca! Where is the bikos
for the gentlemen, no?

24
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,887
lt`s ready, it`s ready!

25
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:10,074
We drive on a little further
until we get to Bubuski....

26
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,448
Now we get to Fulidnish....

27
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,503
Garlic.

28
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:36,108
Garlic, my boy. Garlic.

29
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,646
You think....

30
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,874
Without a doubt.

31
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:52,689
Here.

32
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,124
Here.

33
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,689
ls it finished?

34
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:01,826
-Yes, it`s finished.
-Wait, wait. We don`t go to Brevarsky?

35
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,562
To Brevarsky.

36
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,604
-No, no, no.
-We don`t go to lski?

37
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,073
No, no, not to lski, no.

38
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,139
The whole winter, if need be.
lndeed, the summer as well.

39
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:17,445
lt`s a home away from home, no?

40
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,589
-Tell me....
-l`m telling you!

41
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:24,419
-Listen, you`ve got--
-The garlic.

42
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:25,993
-Garlic.
-No, no, no.

43
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:29,325
-What is all the garlic doing here?
-Where?

44
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,060
Here.

45
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,273
Not garlic, professor.
Please, not garlic.

46
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,877
ls there, by any chance,
a castle in the district?

47
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,639
By any chance a castle
in the district?

48
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:51,849
On the word of Yoyneh, there`s no
more a castle here than a windmill.

49
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,256
Does anybody here know a windmill
in the district?

50
00:07:56,425 --> 00:08:00,191
No? You see? And a castle,
anybody know a castle?

51
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,662
-There`s a castle just over--
-You see?

52
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,667
No castle, no windmill.
Eat, eat, eat.

53
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:12,240
The bikos is good. You like?
Eat! Look, the little one, he`s eating.

54
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,743
There. You see?

55
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:25,183
You have the best room in the house.
With its own bathroom. Come.

56
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,791
You`ll be very warm, nice, comfortable.

57
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,225
Please, just take a look.

58
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,336
l`d forgotten Sarah!

59
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,737
l mean, this bath will be free
when this--

60
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,571
l promise, it will be free tomorrow.

61
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:53,010
Tomorrow, professor.

62
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:57,282
Use the conveniences in the corridor.
Last door on the left.

63
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,353
Good night, gentlemen.

64
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,393
Dear boy!
All these signs!

65
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,256
All these signs!

66
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,127
We are nearing our goal at last!

67
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,098
We are nearing our goal!

68
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,164
Last door on the left?

69
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,907
We are nearing our goal.

70
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,837
No!

71
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,585
l told you to stay in your room!

72
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,114
-But you always take a bath!
-No!

73
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,651
-l`ll give you that bath!
-l won`t! l won`t, Papa! No!

74
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,493
-l told you, every day you are having baths!
-l won`t!

75
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:49,627
l told you, no bath!
No bath! No bath! No bath!

76
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,634
Now you satisfied. Now you got it.

77
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,935
lncredible.

78
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,111
Read this.

79
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:38,243
``According to Elibori...

80
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,754
...they cast no reflected image.

81
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:48,390
Thus, for example, one cannot see them,
nor can they see themselves, in a mirror.

82
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:52,697
ln a mirror.

83
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:57,561
Mirror. Nor in any other
object serving the same purpose...

84
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,574
...like water, windowpanes, etcetera.``

85
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,576
Water, windowpanes....

86
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,477
What`s next? What`s next?

87
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,278
Someone is walking in the corridor.

88
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:36,335
Quickly, take them off! Take them off!

89
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:56,357
Always singing.

90
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,740
What`s my good little fairy up to?
What`s she doing?

91
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,903
Your good little fairy is mending
your nightshirt.

92
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,740
This nightshirt is mine?
No. Yes?

93
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,944
Right, good. lt`s perfect as it is.

94
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,783
l`ll try it on.

95
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:25,449
lf you try your nightshirt
in my room, l scream.

96
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,365
Yoyneh! Yoyneh!

97
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,799
Hurry, hurry!

98
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:40,373
Forget about the buttons.

99
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,277
That hunchback, Alfred.
That hunchback. Did you notice?

100
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,320
Revolting.

101
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:28,822
Why were you under the table?

102
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,935
l think we have a clue!

103
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,347
l want you to follow him.

104
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:21,173
l am not completely daft, you know.

105
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,113
l`m telling you.

106
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:27,881
Someone last night
bashed me on the skull.

107
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,205
l don`t see a bump.

108
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,564
l`m not disturbing you, am l?

109
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,363
Not at all. Not at all.

110
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:01,135
l just don`t know what to do with myself.

111
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,110
l get so bored. You can`t imagine
how bored l get.

112
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:10,549
Don`t know. l`m just not used to
being locked up the whole time.

113
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,686
You mean you`re always locked up?

114
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,322
At school...

115
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,051
...we had fun there.
We used to skip over the wall.

116
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,457
-Did all kinds of things.
-Yeah?

117
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,962
You know what l mean.

118
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,798
Then Papa....
Don`t know what happened to Papa.

119
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:34,102
My room is full of garlic.

120
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,103
He says it looks pretty.

121
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,041
Pretty.

122
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:44,781
-l brought it back from school.
-Oh. lt`s a...

123
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,545
...good one.

124
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,156
-Soft.
-Soft.

125
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,824
Listen.

126
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:57,557
l adore it.

127
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:03,604
l got into the habit of it at school.

128
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,433
He`s funny, Papa.

129
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:11,340
You just can`t change your habits
in a couple of months, can you?

130
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:13,344
Besides...

131
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,443
...it`s good for your hair.

132
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,951
Once a day is the very least.
Don`t you agree?

133
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,680
Yes.

134
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:29,225
Do you mind if l have a quick one?

135
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:34,893
l don`t mind at all, but--

136
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,506
Thank you. You`re being very nice.

137
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,402
Could you get me some hot water?

138
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:06,360
-Where are you going?
-All right, dear, l`m not going!

139
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,338
Thank you.

140
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,627
What about the umbrella?

141
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,935
Are you crazy?

142
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,173
l saw him! l saw him! He`s there! There!

143
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,376
Sarah!

144
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:52,731
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency Von Krolock!

145
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,892
Give me back my daughter!

146
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,664
Give her back to me!

147
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:03,277
Your Excellency!
Little Sarah! Excellency!

148
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,845
-Shagal, Shagal!
-My little girl!

149
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:09,848
-Shagal.
-l beg you!

150
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:13,974
Careful. Take care. Careful.

151
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,242
Careful.

152
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,129
What?

153
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,935
Yoyneh!

154
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:51,071
Look, Alfred.

155
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,299
They have drained him
in the twinkling of an eye.

156
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:58,037
They are mighty fierce
this winter, the beasts.

157
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,775
-We ought to organize a beat.
-Found one in the forest...

158
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,010
...with his throat ripped!

159
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:08,815
Now they have taken to devouring
each other. Poor Shagal.

160
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,949
-To end in the jaws of a wolf.
-A wolf.

161
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:16,563
A wolf! You blind wretches!

162
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,063
Open your eyes!

163
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,896
You know perfectly well
who has been at work.

164
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,062
-Ripped.
-Ripped.

165
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,373
You poor victims of your own cowardice!

166
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,382
Stick it where?

167
00:30:40,555 --> 00:30:42,887
Madam Shagal,
l have already explained...

168
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:47,016
...the body of Mr. Shagal is destroyed,
but one can save his soul...

169
00:30:47,195 --> 00:30:48,924
...by sticking it in.

170
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,088
-Sticking it in?
-Yes.

171
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,494
-Where?
-ln the heart.

172
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,602
According to the works of Elibori
and my own research...

173
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,331
...it is the only way.
Like this, in one go.

174
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,900
-Not.
-Yes!

175
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,136
The works of Elibori.

176
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,679
ln whose heart?

177
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,080
Sticking it in...

178
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:18,657
...in my Yoyneh`s heart?

179
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:20,657
Stick in my Yoyneh`s heart?

180
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:22,090
You hear, Yoyneh?

181
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:26,563
This swine wants me to stick
this shank in your heart!

182
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:31,535
You stupid old goat!

183
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:33,697
Stick it?! l`ll stick this...

184
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,173
-...right through you, you old fool!
-l will!

185
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:55,188
You one-eyed, blind...!

186
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:49,338
One, two, three!

187
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:54,378
-Great.
-He`s gone?

188
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:01,050
Not bad, this little wine.

189
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:43,154
Have you got the wrong vampire!

190
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:51,198
There. ln there.

191
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,972
l thought so.

192
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:04,709
Madam Jackal-- Shagal.
We must all get down to work.

193
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:09,288
Of course we shall need your assistance.
First we must block up the window.

194
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:23,069
Good. Good. Next, garlic.
Plenty of garlic everywhere.

195
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:27,037
And some crucifixes.
l`ll lend you some.

196
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,644
Tomorrow l will see to the transfusion.

197
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:35,413
ls everything clear?
Well, let me repeat.

198
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:39,519
The garlic, window blocked, crucifixer...

199
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:44,147
...here, there, there.

200
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:12,149
Professor, the other way around.
Other way around.

201
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:30,544
-l can feel something soft.
-Where are you?

202
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:33,015
Here.

203
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:35,155
Here.

204
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,814
lt`s a curtain.

205
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:45,821
There is a door behind it.

206
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:24,395
l have a funny feeling
we are being watched.

207
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:29,838
Oh, since you are here, my friend,
perhaps you could tell me--

208
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:51,073
So this is how one worms
one`s way into my castle.

209
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:57,121
-Well, to be precise, sir--
-Count Von Krolock.

210
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,033
``Professor Abronsius.
Kurnigsburg University.``

211
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:16,265
This alters everything.

212
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:19,640
l have had the opportunity
of reading your work:

213
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:22,338
The Bat, its Mysteries.

214
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:26,213
-No, really?
-Remarkable.

215
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:30,982
l must have a copy somewhere.
l would like you to inscribe it for me.

216
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:36,221
l-- Well, Your Excellency is too kind.

217
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:41,834
-So you lost your way?
-No. Actually, we were running after--

218
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:45,494
You were running after...?

219
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:49,472
A pteropus. Yes, we were
running after a pteropus.

220
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:52,271
Fancy that.

221
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:56,212
l thought bats fell into a deep sleep
throughout the winter months.

222
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,180
Not always, Your Excellency.

223
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,945
Nevertheless, that is what
l read in your book.

224
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:05,854
Precisely, so you can understand the
amazement of my assistant and myself.

225
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:08,790
We could not believe our eyes.
lsn`t that so, Alfred?

226
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:12,864
-No, we couldn`t. lt was like--
-Now, imagine, a chiroptera...

227
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:17,299
...flitting about in December? lncredible.

228
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:22,033
What`s more, it was as big as this.
Wasn`t it, Alfred?

229
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:26,737
-Like....
-Of course, the case is not unique.

230
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:29,438
ln my second volume,
actually at the printer`s...

231
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:33,552
...l site several analogous cases
supplied to me by reputable colleagues...

232
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,952
...such as Falkman at Munich,
Dr. Athener of Prague.

233
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:42,391
-Curious.
-Curious, yes, but in no way inexplicable.

234
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:46,020
l think we can look for the cause
in the purely mechanical need...

235
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:49,362
...to fight against the torpor
of hibernation...

236
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:54,200
...to restore circulation
by primary motion...

237
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:59,607
...to cause the vital limbs
to work without thinking.

238
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:05,682
This, in consequence,
makes them fly...

239
00:45:05,852 --> 00:45:09,549
...without being aware of it.

240
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:12,453
Of course, l only refer
to the very rare species...

241
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,720
...not conforming
to the laws of hibernation.

242
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,593
Rather like sleepwalkers?

243
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:24,530
Yes.

244
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:28,663
Let us say, they fly in their sleep.

245
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,868
l had an aunt who was a sleepwalker.

246
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:34,980
At night she frequently
ran about on the battlements...

247
00:45:35,148 --> 00:45:39,107
...without causing me any surprise,
because there was actual contact.

248
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:41,015
But the walking isn`t flying.

249
00:45:41,188 --> 00:45:43,986
How is it possible to avoid
an obstacle when flying...

250
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:47,524
...while being simultaneously asleep?

251
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:52,631
Your Excellency is a very great authority.

252
00:45:55,368 --> 00:45:59,566
The natural sciences
greatly interested me...

253
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:03,940
...when l was a young man.

254
00:46:06,313 --> 00:46:08,781
My library.

255
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:25,463
lt`s at your disposal.

256
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:33,833
To fly in one`s sleep, you say.
How is it possible?

257
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,078
The rays.

258
00:46:43,483 --> 00:46:47,044
-Rays?
-The rays.

259
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:59,198
Gentlemen, Koukol informs me
that your beds are prepared.

260
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:01,960
Your Excellency,
we have kept you up very late.

261
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:07,573
l`m a night bird.
l am not much good in the daytime.

262
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:20,052
Their little heads contain
a fantastic mechanism, sort of....

263
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,986
Anyway, this mechanism emits the rays,
the nature of which escapes me...

264
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:27,217
...but one thing is absolutely certain,
that these rays...

265
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:32,024
...come into contact with every obstacle
in the way and rebound off that obstacle...

266
00:47:32,198 --> 00:47:34,598
...back into their little heads
and warn them.

267
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,566
That would explain why they
can fly in utter darkness.

268
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:39,830
Exactly!

269
00:47:42,742 --> 00:47:44,710
Herbert, my son.

270
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:48,507
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

271
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,916
Good evening.

272
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:26,245
Here is your room.
And this one is for you.

273
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:30,412
-What?
-The rooms...

274
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,115
...communicate.

275
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:54,337
Good night, gentlemen.

276
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:21,003
The fellow is no fool, you know.

277
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:26,111
Did you hear how he held his own
on the subject of the bats?

278
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:34,510
Really sound arguments.

279
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:39,356
Not like those morons from Kurnigsburg.

280
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:42,927
-You see, my boy?
-Yeah.

281
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,291
Professor?

282
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:47,960
Aren`t we going to barricade?

283
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:51,535
No, l don`t think that
will be very good tactics.

284
00:49:51,704 --> 00:49:53,672
l thought we were going to barricade.

285
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,638
No, the best thing is to sleep
with one eye open...

286
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,836
...or to take the watch in turns.

287
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:05,282
What is it? What is it?

288
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:10,282
What are you doing?

289
00:50:10,457 --> 00:50:11,947
l`m going to bed.

290
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:15,617
What has come over you?
Go to your own bed.

291
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,424
-Alone?
-Go.

292
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:27,369
We can keep the door open.

293
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,304
At the slightest alarm...

294
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:32,809
...we call out.

295
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,480
Mr. Koukol, l`m not disturbing a soul here.

296
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:35,917
There`s plenty of room.
People can pass over here.

297
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:43,085
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

298
00:54:43,262 --> 00:54:46,925
Mr. Koukol, please.

299
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,233
Mr. Koukol, what are you
doing to me, please?

300
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:53,395
l beg of you--

301
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:55,541
Look, l--

302
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,813
Please, it`s not comfortable here.

303
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:06,349
lt`s dirty here. Look, the day`s coming.

304
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:11,354
There`s too much light
here for me. Mr. Koukol....

305
00:55:15,795 --> 00:55:19,253
So now you are satisfied?

306
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:28,872
What can you do with such people?

307
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,601
Hunchback swine.

308
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:34,747
What does it cost?
Does it cost him anything?

309
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:38,680
He should leave me in there.
Why does he bring me here?

310
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:56,001
Sarah.

311
00:56:17,223 --> 00:56:18,918
Sarah.

312
00:56:59,899 --> 00:57:01,389
He`s got a nerve.

313
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:04,832
-A nerve?
-Von Krolock, he`s brazen.

314
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,302
You remember last night?

315
00:57:07,473 --> 00:57:12,809
``l am a night bird.
l am not much good in the daytime.``

316
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:16,437
-That`s what he said.
-Yeah? So what?

317
00:57:16,616 --> 00:57:20,916
lt`s obvious.
During the daytime he rests, he reposes.

318
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:24,716
-Reposes?
-ln the crypt with his fellows.

319
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:29,093
Maybe there is no crypt in this castle.

320
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:35,258
Don`t be foolish. A castle without
a crypt is like a unicorn without a horn.

321
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:39,768
You`re not going to start arguing with me
like my colleagues from Kurnigsburg?

322
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:45,273
Oh, first-rate, this bed.

323
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:48,242
Did you sleep well?

324
00:57:50,449 --> 00:57:52,383
l heard singing.

325
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,020
Well, that`s no reason
to look so worried.

326
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:58,122
l`m sure it was Sarah. Sarah, yes.

327
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:01,920
-And who is Sarah?
-Sarah, Shagal`s daughter.

328
00:58:02,094 --> 00:58:04,824
Oh, yes, of course.

329
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:10,193
l must confess l rather enjoy luxury.

330
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:13,702
All these years running uphill...

331
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:18,606
...and down dale,
debating with morons.

332
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:22,111
Trying to convince a pack of fools.

333
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:26,183
Oh, and the expense,
perpetual expense.

334
00:58:26,352 --> 00:58:27,580
l`m sure it was Sarah.

335
00:58:27,753 --> 00:58:31,348
Do you know what that robber Shagal
charges us for board and lodging?

336
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:34,049
-Her father?
-Four dollars, my boy.

337
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:37,821
Yes, by Jupiter. Four a day.

338
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:42,661
Bed without breakfast. The ruffian.

339
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:46,498
-Do you feel in good shape, at least?
-Yes.

340
00:58:46,672 --> 00:58:48,970
-We`ve got a lot on our plate.
-To find Sarah?

341
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:51,268
Now, keep calm. The crypt comes first.

342
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:57,246
-But what about Sarah?
-We mustn`t put the cart before the horse.

343
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:45,489
-What`s he up to?
-He`s woodworking.

344
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,930
But it`s a coffin.

345
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:53,795
-Footprints.
-She`s dead.

346
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:57,739
-Eureka!
-Dead. Dead.

347
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,470
Who is dead?

348
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:03,513
-Sarah.
-When?

349
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:09,176
-What ``when``?
-Sarah`s death.

350
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,913
Oh, my God.

351
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:14,287
-Where is she?
-l don`t know.

352
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:19,261
What are you driveling about? How can you
tell me she`s dead when you don`t know?

353
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:23,562
-The coffin, it`s for her.
-No, no, no, no. They are still working on it.

354
01:00:23,736 --> 01:00:28,298
lf she were dead, she would already be in it
like one of them, screened from the light.

355
01:00:28,474 --> 01:00:31,136
-She`s not dead?
-Work it out for yourself.

356
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,370
You may be sure they`ll make her
last as long as they can.

357
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,037
lt`s their idea of fun.

358
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:39,150
ln that case, who is the coffin for?

359
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:42,481
Oh, for her or....

360
01:00:59,872 --> 01:01:03,035
Don`t look at him. Behave naturally.

361
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:07,009
Recite for me the 1 2 signs of the Zodiac.

362
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,946
Leo, Virgo...

363
01:01:10,116 --> 01:01:13,882
...Gemini, Cancer, White Boar.

364
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:17,352
What are you talking about?

365
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:22,160
No panic.

366
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:26,196
This lout guards the crypt like a Cerberus.

367
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:29,493
We must think of a stratagem.

368
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:36,130
Just whistle as if nothing has happened
and let`s turn back.

369
01:01:39,845 --> 01:01:43,042
Not so fast.

370
01:05:07,419 --> 01:05:09,614
l`m stuck.

371
01:05:09,788 --> 01:05:12,484
You`ll have to help me, my boy.

372
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,370
lmbecile!

373
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,414
l can`t get a grip.

374
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:45,622
You will have to operate on your own.

375
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,759
-Operate on my own?
-Yes.

376
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:50,087
What has to be done?

377
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:52,662
The stakes, my boy.

378
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:55,095
The stakes?

379
01:05:55,267 --> 01:05:57,792
-These stakes?
-What other stakes could there be?

380
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,438
They must be driven in.

381
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,341
-By me?
-They`re not going to drive in on their own!

382
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:08,742
-Not that, master. Please, not that.
-Come on, my boy, show some guts!

383
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:10,711
l`m here.

384
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,818
First you must remove the lids.

385
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:17,183
Oh, Mama. Remove the lids?

386
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:18,914
lt`s an order.

387
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:35,131
Go on.

388
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:38,504
Open it, for heaven`s sake!

389
01:06:47,286 --> 01:06:49,277
l can`t, master.

390
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:54,051
For the sake of Shagal`s daughter, open it!

391
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,470
Open your eyes.

392
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,474
Open your eyes!

393
01:07:18,717 --> 01:07:20,344
Who is it?

394
01:07:22,087 --> 01:07:23,714
-His Excellency.
-Good.

395
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:26,357
Now, the other one.

396
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:48,711
And this one?

397
01:07:51,783 --> 01:07:54,183
His Excellency`s son.

398
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,512
And....

399
01:08:00,692 --> 01:08:02,387
And what?

400
01:08:03,795 --> 01:08:06,423
-And what?
-Shagal!

401
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:10,926
He`s there?

402
01:08:11,904 --> 01:08:14,839
Very well. Open the case.

403
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,171
Pick up a stake...

404
01:08:21,346 --> 01:08:23,405
...and a hammer.

405
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,514
Now...

406
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:28,209
...go do the count.

407
01:08:29,154 --> 01:08:34,148
Search for the right spot, in between the
seventh and eighth on the left. Don`t forget.

408
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:41,196
Place the stake over the spot.

409
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:45,265
Not upside-down!

410
01:08:45,604 --> 01:08:47,128
That`s it!

411
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:49,732
Raise the hammer...

412
01:08:50,142 --> 01:08:51,734
...and...

413
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:54,242
...strike!

414
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,175
Strike!

415
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:59,408
Oh, mutiny, is it?

416
01:08:59,585 --> 01:09:02,247
l will take an oath if there is mutiny.

417
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:06,423
Come on, my baby. Hit.

418
01:09:06,592 --> 01:09:10,961
There`s a good little scout.

419
01:09:12,864 --> 01:09:16,994
Are you going to hit it or not,
you good for nothing--

420
01:09:30,148 --> 01:09:31,877
All right.

421
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:34,351
Everything back in the case.

422
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,786
lt`s no use.

423
01:09:38,223 --> 01:09:43,820
You will have to pull me out.
From the other side, dumbbell!

424
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:47,989
Mind he doesn`t catch you.

425
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,753
-Sarah!
-lt`s you!

426
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:29,100
Sarah....

427
01:11:37,242 --> 01:11:40,905
l`m going to save you.
We`ll go away together.

428
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,513
Where do you want us to go?

429
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:47,277
l don`t know.
To your parents`, perhaps.

430
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:51,013
They said Papa will be coming
to see me soon.

431
01:11:51,757 --> 01:11:53,691
They said that?

432
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:57,555
Yes. You-- You`ve seen my dress?

433
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:59,492
Beautiful, isn`t it?

434
01:11:59,664 --> 01:12:01,222
Very beautiful.

435
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,494
They gave it to me for the ball tonight.

436
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,370
Ball?

437
01:12:06,972 --> 01:12:08,599
The midnight ball.

438
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:11,937
This evening, here? A ball?

439
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,907
At midnight?

440
01:12:14,179 --> 01:12:15,737
They`ll all be there.

441
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:18,474
But we can still have a dance together,
you know?

442
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:21,778
Sarah, you must follow me.

443
01:12:21,953 --> 01:12:23,250
Follow you?

444
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,652
l beseech you.

445
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:30,457
Well, tomorrow, perhaps.

446
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:33,826
But tomorrow will be too late.

447
01:12:37,235 --> 01:12:39,100
Turn around.

448
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:09,928
Sarah?

449
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:11,563
May l turn around?

450
01:14:58,877 --> 01:15:02,973
My head is swimming around.

451
01:15:07,485 --> 01:15:11,683
l`m no longer the age
for this sort of activity.

452
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,192
Look! How wonderful nature is.

453
01:15:19,764 --> 01:15:21,755
Yes. Wonderful.

454
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:26,563
The sun is setting.
Glorious! Magnificent!

455
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,837
The sun is setting
and they are going to rise.

456
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:33,569
lt`s in the order of things.

457
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:52,988
Oh, what a pity not to have the time.

458
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:57,328
Once l get stuck into it,
l am engulfed for a week!

459
01:15:57,502 --> 01:15:59,094
This way, master.

460
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:00,794
Wait.

461
01:16:27,932 --> 01:16:30,366
Pretty well-equipped.

462
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:38,474
Professor....

463
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:42,546
Here is Orion!

464
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:47,182
And here is Saturn, with its ring!

465
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:51,850
Come. Come and have a look, my boy.
There it is.

466
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:20,006
Courage, my good woman, courage.

467
01:17:30,195 --> 01:17:32,595
Bless my soul.

468
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:38,028
Shiver my timbers!

469
01:17:39,037 --> 01:17:42,131
Unless they barricade thoroughly....

470
01:17:42,307 --> 01:17:45,333
l know what l am talking about--

471
01:18:14,739 --> 01:18:16,366
Sarah?

472
01:18:23,314 --> 01:18:25,282
Are you ill?

473
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:29,516
How pale he is!

474
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:31,348
l`m not pale.

475
01:18:31,523 --> 01:18:35,084
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
l assure you.

476
01:18:38,696 --> 01:18:40,891
You are as white as a sheet.

477
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,533
-No!
-Yes, Alfred.

478
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,497
You must have a rest.

479
01:18:57,615 --> 01:19:01,346
Have a little rest and you`ll feel
much, much better.

480
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:03,680
l don`t like to see you in this state.

481
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:11,326
There, now. Feeling better?

482
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:14,397
lsn`t there a ball tonight?

483
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:18,267
How long they are.

484
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:22,405
They look like golden threads.

485
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:25,640
Your lashes.

486
01:19:25,944 --> 01:19:28,003
My lashes?

487
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,277
Golden....

488
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:42,954
Who told you there`s going
to be a ball tonight?

489
01:19:43,428 --> 01:19:46,022
Nobody. l`m just guessing.

490
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:48,825
With a great castle like this,
it`s possible.

491
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,230
He`s just guessing. But it`s true.

492
01:19:51,402 --> 01:19:53,836
You`ve guessed correctly
with your pretty head.

493
01:19:54,005 --> 01:20:00,433
Yes, Alfred, there`s going to be a ball,
and you will be able to dance.

494
01:20:07,452 --> 01:20:10,717
What is it you`re clutching there
like a little treasure?

495
01:20:10,955 --> 01:20:13,355
Here. Show me.

496
01:20:13,524 --> 01:20:15,856
Alfred, show me.

497
01:20:22,967 --> 01:20:25,561
So that`s the big secret.

498
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:28,069
Somebody is in love.

499
01:20:28,506 --> 01:20:32,840
Somebody`s little heart is beating
around in their bosom.

500
01:20:33,044 --> 01:20:37,811
Pitter-pat, pitter-pat, pitter-pat,
like a rat in a cage.

501
01:20:39,384 --> 01:20:41,579
``Seventieth way:

502
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,856
Place the left arm around
the shoulders of the loved one.

503
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:49,718
Put the left hand on her left shoulder...

504
01:20:49,894 --> 01:20:53,955
...like a little birdie alighting
on a branch.``

505
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:56,657
Good. Excellent.

506
01:20:56,935 --> 01:21:00,200
``Then let an angel pass.``

507
01:21:00,538 --> 01:21:03,632
Shall we allow an angel to pass?

508
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,869
``Once the angel has passed...

509
01:21:08,046 --> 01:21:11,243
...bend the face towards the locks
of the loved one...

510
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:14,977
...and brush them with the lips.``

511
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,873
Close the door!

512
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,442
-Playing games?
-Close the door!

513
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:35,015
He went berserk.
Did you provoke him or what?

514
01:23:35,259 --> 01:23:36,886
No.

515
01:23:37,061 --> 01:23:40,121
-He got excited all on his own.
-On his own. On his own.

516
01:23:40,731 --> 01:23:43,029
-Oh, l meant to tell you--
-What?

517
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:46,500
-Elibori`s theory is correct.
-Which one?

518
01:23:46,804 --> 01:23:48,829
The one to do with the reflections.

519
01:23:49,006 --> 01:23:52,407
-ln the mirror. l was--
-Explain yourself more clearly.

520
01:23:52,577 --> 01:23:58,072
l was in front of a mirror,
sitting on the edge of a bed and....

521
01:23:58,249 --> 01:24:00,217
And, well, l was alone...

522
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,410
...yet he was by my side,
but nothing from him.

523
01:24:03,588 --> 01:24:07,115
No reflection. Nothing. Blank.

524
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:10,783
-Not even his clothes?
-Not even his shirt.

525
01:24:11,562 --> 01:24:13,860
l`d love to have seen that.

526
01:24:14,031 --> 01:24:16,591
One doesn`t see a thing.

527
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,702
You found something to eat?

528
01:24:19,871 --> 01:24:21,566
l? No.

529
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:25,368
There is a smell of garlic sausage.

530
01:25:18,496 --> 01:25:20,589
Good gracious!

531
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:24,662
l`m frightened.

532
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:27,470
lt`s quite impressive.

533
01:25:27,638 --> 01:25:30,300
-You think they are all--?
-Undoubtedly!

534
01:25:30,474 --> 01:25:33,739
-Oh, my God.
-You should never have come here.

535
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:37,369
-So why did we come?
-Ask the professor.

536
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,748
Oh, so you`re here. You`re here.

537
01:25:40,918 --> 01:25:45,048
lf you have no objection,
l`m not hibernating.

538
01:25:46,023 --> 01:25:48,617
-You don`t seem very pleased.
-l am surprised.

539
01:25:48,793 --> 01:25:52,126
Keep your surprise for later on,
you`ll need it.

540
01:25:57,268 --> 01:26:02,035
You didn`t foresee this in your
second volume, still at the printer`s.

541
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,568
lt will be my pleasure to fill in
the gaps in your learning.

542
01:26:05,843 --> 01:26:08,971
When you attain my spiritual level...

543
01:26:09,146 --> 01:26:13,242
...we shall then have the long winter
evenings before us for our discussions.

544
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:16,511
The long evenings...

545
01:26:16,687 --> 01:26:19,986
...of many winters.

546
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:25,284
Your young assistant will make
an excellent companion for my son.

547
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,621
He`s already quite fond of him.

548
01:26:27,798 --> 01:26:30,699
He`s told me so. He`s a gentle...

549
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:33,302
...sensitive youth.

550
01:26:34,038 --> 01:26:37,906
ln the course of the centuries,
they`ll learn to know each other better...

551
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:40,168
...just as we shall.

552
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:46,509
As brooks flow into streams,
streams into rivers...

553
01:26:46,684 --> 01:26:48,345
...and rivers into the sea...

554
01:26:48,519 --> 01:26:53,456
...so our adepts flow back to us
and swell our ranks.

555
01:26:53,624 --> 01:26:56,422
Soon we shall be
victorious and triumphant!

556
01:26:56,594 --> 01:26:58,824
We shall then hold sway over this Earth...

557
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:02,796
...which awaits our coming
as autumn awaits winter.

558
01:27:08,572 --> 01:27:12,099
Look at him, almost an old man...

559
01:27:12,276 --> 01:27:14,676
...with his flabby stomach
and spindly legs...

560
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:17,439
...bring, with dog-like devotion,
a fresh adept...

561
01:27:17,615 --> 01:27:20,812
...who only a few nights ago
was under his protection.

562
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:25,081
Look well at this man who secreted
another girl more closely...

563
01:27:25,256 --> 01:27:27,724
-...than a miser hoarding his gold.
-Sarah!

564
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:33,125
But tonight he`s happy.
See how he frisks and capers.

565
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:45,032
l must leave you now.

566
01:27:45,209 --> 01:27:47,677
See you later, gentlemen.

567
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:51,913
Meditate while awaiting your turn...

568
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:55,712
...for it would be extremely difficult
for you to get away from here.

569
01:27:55,886 --> 01:27:58,787
Unless, of course, you have wings.

570
01:28:00,591 --> 01:28:02,252
Like a bat.

571
01:28:48,839 --> 01:28:53,435
He displeased me as much this evening
as he impressed me the first time.

572
01:29:03,187 --> 01:29:05,052
What they deserve is...

573
01:29:05,222 --> 01:29:07,952
...a good cannonball right in the--

574
01:29:24,608 --> 01:29:27,543
Quick, help me turn it around!

575
01:29:37,922 --> 01:29:39,651
A little more.

576
01:29:42,426 --> 01:29:43,893
More.

577
01:29:53,938 --> 01:29:57,271
Would you mind giving me a hand? Good.

578
01:29:59,743 --> 01:30:01,938
Put the wood under the cannon!

579
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,511
Under the cannon, under the cannon.

580
01:30:57,835 --> 01:31:01,635
Takes me for a nincompoop.
That necrophile.

581
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:32,798
A year ago....

582
01:31:34,271 --> 01:31:39,675
A year ago, exactly on this same night,
we were assembled here in this very room.

583
01:31:39,843 --> 01:31:43,870
l, your pastor, and you,
my beloved flock.

584
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:47,073
With hopefulness in my heart,
l told you then...

585
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:53,281
...that with Lucifer`s aid we might look
forward to a more succulent occasion.

586
01:31:53,991 --> 01:31:56,221
Cast back your minds.

587
01:31:56,393 --> 01:32:00,523
There we were, gathered together,
gloomy and despondent...

588
01:32:00,698 --> 01:32:05,658
...around that single meager woodcutter.

589
01:32:07,338 --> 01:32:09,670
A year has elapsed...

590
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,708
...and although travelers turn up
more and more seldom in these parts...

591
01:32:13,877 --> 01:32:17,779
...in spite of this,
l have this evening a great...

592
01:32:17,948 --> 01:32:21,782
...a wonderful surprise for you!

593
01:32:22,152 --> 01:32:25,349
Dearly beloved brethren...

594
01:32:25,522 --> 01:32:27,888
...come closer.

595
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,795
This isn`t all.

596
01:32:37,968 --> 01:32:39,902
This isn`t all!

597
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:45,303
Yet another human
is at this very moment being groomed.

598
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:46,704
And!

599
01:32:46,877 --> 01:32:49,209
And! And!

600
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:54,750
Two more humans are in our hands!

601
01:33:39,563 --> 01:33:41,656
Go on, go on. Have your bath now.

602
01:33:41,832 --> 01:33:43,265
Then turn your back to me.

603
01:33:43,434 --> 01:33:46,699
All those ladies and gentlemen
are awaiting you. Listen!

604
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:49,065
Listen to the music.

605
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,906
Come on, take it off!

606
01:33:52,076 --> 01:33:55,409
-Don´t you look.
-I´m not looking, I´m not looking.

607
01:33:55,846 --> 01:34:00,044
-Will I be seeing His Excellency?
-Yes, you´ll see His Excellency.

608
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:02,378
It´s for me, this lovely dress?

609
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:06,546
Yeah, for you, this lovely dress.
And so are the shoes.

610
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:09,284
I wonder what His Excellency´s like.

611
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:12,918
Look here, what are you doing? Oh, no!

612
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:17,724
Now, listen, I´m old enough to be your--
I´m still your boss, my girl.

613
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:21,061
If you do that again,
I´m telling His Excellency.

614
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:24,207
-Forget your precious Excellency a minute.
-Shagal!

615
01:34:27,111 --> 01:34:29,204
What? Who spoke?

616
01:34:29,379 --> 01:34:31,847
I did!

617
01:34:35,486 --> 01:34:37,454
Who is speaking, who?

618
01:34:37,621 --> 01:34:41,387
How dare you ask questions, you letch!

619
01:34:41,558 --> 01:34:44,026
Please! Forgive me!

620
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,993
l didn`t mean to ask questions.
You understand. Thank you.

621
01:34:48,165 --> 01:34:50,133
Have you unhitched the horse?

622
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,667
Horse? Oy. l`ll go. l`ll go at once!

623
01:34:53,837 --> 01:34:57,068
l`ll need it harnessed, you idiot!

624
01:34:58,075 --> 01:35:01,511
-Oh, and Shagal, about that girl....
-Yeah?

625
01:35:01,678 --> 01:35:05,774
-Don´t you touch her again!
-l`m not touching! Who`s touching?

626
01:35:44,988 --> 01:35:47,718
You`re pulling my leg.

627
01:35:51,461 --> 01:35:54,487
You wouldn`t do a thing
like that to Yoyneh.

628
01:35:55,098 --> 01:35:58,067
Hey. Answer me.

629
01:36:28,265 --> 01:36:32,463
lf they had listened to me,
all this would never have happened.

630
01:36:33,003 --> 01:36:34,698
Can`t we do anything for her?

631
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,499
She`s one of them already.

632
01:36:36,673 --> 01:36:38,732
And Sarah?

633
01:36:38,909 --> 01:36:41,104
Quick, professor, quick!

634
01:36:45,082 --> 01:36:46,344
The case.

635
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:49,345
That damned case.

636
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:52,679
Why did you have to lose it?

637
01:38:01,024 --> 01:38:02,753
lt is l.

638
01:38:04,294 --> 01:38:06,592
Life has a meaning once more.

639
01:38:07,364 --> 01:38:09,423
We are going to save you.

640
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:22,703
You spoke to her?

641
01:38:32,556 --> 01:38:34,786
l had a word with her.

642
01:38:42,099 --> 01:38:44,431
After a good transfusion...

643
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:52,270
...and a few days` rest,
you will be as right as rain, my child.

644
01:39:07,824 --> 01:39:10,918
We`ve got a congress in Venice.

645
01:39:11,094 --> 01:39:15,827
The palaces, the sky.
Venice, Sarah, Venice.

646
01:39:15,999 --> 01:39:21,369
The gondolas. The sun. The sea.

647
01:39:23,073 --> 01:39:26,270
At the next turn, we make for the door.

648
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:37,411
-Light. Life. Love.
-When l say ``hop,`` we make for the door...

649
01:39:37,587 --> 01:39:40,112
-...and run for it.
-Our love.

650
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:29,698
Snatch the girl from them!

651
01:40:56,533 --> 01:40:58,023
Sharpen your teeth!

652
01:41:36,973 --> 01:41:39,305
The bats!

653
01:41:44,114 --> 01:41:47,277
l`ve never come across
such remarkable specimens.

654
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:51,112
-We haven`t got the time!
-l would have to examine them in detail...

655
01:41:51,288 --> 01:41:55,486
...but here and now l can assert
we are dealing with Pteropus Poliocephalus.

656
01:41:55,659 --> 01:41:58,253
We haven`t got the time.

657
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:41,598
Go. One, two, three, four. Good.

658
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:57,805
Go! Go, Koukol, go!

659
01:43:57,981 --> 01:44:01,007
Give them a little hell, fire and blood!

660
01:44:01,184 --> 01:44:05,553
Go! Catch them!

661
01:45:31,441 --> 01:45:33,739
Go on, sleep.

662
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:39,348
Your....

663
01:45:39,516 --> 01:45:44,920
Your tiny hand. lt`s frozen.

664
01:45:47,557 --> 01:45:49,525
Professor, she`s....

665
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,121
Tiny hand is....

666
01:46:00,303 --> 01:46:02,533
l thought that....

667
01:46:04,741 --> 01:46:10,577
My little hand, my pretty hand.
Soon l will be sleeping--

668
01:46:24,527 --> 01:46:30,022
That night, fleeing from Transylvania,
Professor Abronsius never guessed...

669
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:35,137
...he was carrying away with him
the very evil he had wished to destroy.

670
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:41,608
Thanks to him, this evil would at last
be able to spread across the world.
