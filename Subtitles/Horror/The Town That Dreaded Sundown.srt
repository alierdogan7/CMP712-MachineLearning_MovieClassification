It was based on nothin'.

868
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,380
But Hank McCreedy's
pregnant wife,

869
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,306
she demands an autopsy.

870
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,635
And then it come out.
He wasn't run over.

871
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,312
He was stabbed
more than two dozen times,

872
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,684
right next to the tracks.

873
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,477
My daddy, he had
a theory about that.

874
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,315
He said that the Phantom
killed McCreedy,

875
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:49,197
you know, his last victim,
his final goodbye.

876
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,660
And then he hopped
a train to California.

877
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,834
Mr. Pierce, I've read everything
there is to read on this.

878
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,831
I've never even heard
of this Hank McCreedy.

879
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,332
It should have been
front-page news.

880
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,167
But while the Arkansas
police were findin' McCreedy,

881
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,844
the Texas police,
they were arresting Sewell

882
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,671
and so you got
two different camps

883
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,035
each saying
they got the Phantom.

884
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,346
And what neither of them
is piecing together is that

885
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:16,349
Sewell was in custody
when McCreedy was killed,

886
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,101
proving that neither
one was the Phantom.

887
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,975
So Sewell was in jail,

888
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,107
and then, did anything
ever come from McCreedy?

889
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,688
Oh, he's dead.

890
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,782
Yep, and dead men
don't complain much.

891
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,700
But his pregnant wife, Mary,

892
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:31,868
she's pissed as shit.

893
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,195
Her name was Mary?

894
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,031
My daddy tracked
her down in 1974.

895
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,367
And, oh, she was still bitter.

896
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,544
She said that Texarkana

897
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,667
had done worse than
killed her husband.

898
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,544
It had shat on his memory.

899
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,172
And in the process, it was
shitting on her life.

900
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,877
It was shitting on
her son's life.

901
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,713
Who you think is the Phantom?

902
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,299
No! No!

903
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,134
Sorry.

904
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,221
Hank McCreedy's dead.

905
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,648
His son is dead.
His grandson

906
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,733
is still alive.

907
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,811
That's your Phantom,
right there.

908
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:06,975
You're making this shit up.

909
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,571
No! Boy, listen to me.

910
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,742
I am telling you what
I know to be true.

911
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:15,071
That Mary McCreedy did pour
poison about Texarkana

912
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,700
into Hank Jr.'s ear.

913
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,578
Hank did the same
thing to his son!

914
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,409
They did, consciously
or unconsciously,

915
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,335
they bred themselves a killer!

916
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:27,675
Mr. Pierce, do you have any
proof of this being true,

917
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,002
or is this just something
that your father told you?

01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,520

922
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,864

about the McCreedys.

01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,204
He was my best friend.

924
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,038
Now he's deceased.

925
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,089
I tracked down
Mary McCreedy in 1986.

926
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,543
I found that scary old
bitch on her deathbed,

927
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,636
and she warned me.

928
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,968
She said that her
grandson would do

929
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,470
what her son didn't have
the balls to do.

930
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,892
Make Texarkana
pay for its sins.

931
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,980

939
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,628
if McCreedy did
have a grandson,

940
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,177
he'd probably be in his 20s
or his 30s, at least. Nick.

Now, his name wasn't even
mentioned in the papers.

952

He doesn't have
a plaque anywhere.

953

He's not even in the movie that
they show every damn year.
