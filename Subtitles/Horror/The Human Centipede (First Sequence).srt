Yeah we got you a present.

20
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,000
No we can't tell you what it
is, it's a surprise.

21
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Oh yeah, the other thing is that 
we met this cut German waiter.

22
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
<i>Jenny thinks he's pretty cute</i>

23
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,300
<i>Yeah, and he invited us to a party

24
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
So we're going to go.

25
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,300
But we should go.

26
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,500

32
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,000
I think we were suppose to turn

33
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,600

34
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,000
I thought you know exactly
where we sere going!

35
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,100
Do we go left or right?

36
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,300
I'm sorry, but I just don't know
where we are.

37
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
What was that?

38
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,400
I have no idea.

39
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,100
You must have run over a pot whole or something.

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,800
There's always a signal.

58
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,500
Not out here in the middle of nowhere.

59
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,100

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Do not understand what he says.

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,700
Um, can you call someone?

81
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,000

Is your door locked?

89
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Yes, my door is locked.

90
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,300
Why's he still staring at us?

91
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,300

We need to walk and find someplace, 
somebody who can help us.

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600

How do you know?
All trees look the same.

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,200
Leaving the car
is the stupidest idea.

103
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
We would have been waiting for hours, Jenny.

104
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,500
I'll fetch a towel.

187
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,400
What just happened?

188
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,500
I don't know.

189
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,900
We need to get out of here right now.

190
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah.

191
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,400
It's freaking me out.

192
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,800
You want to? just call a taxi
so we can go back to the hotel.

193
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Let's go back to the Hotel, okay.

194
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,200
- We'll get the car in the morning car.
- Okay. Yeah.

195
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,500
I am really tired.

196
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,600
Listen, If you could just call a taxi service,
we're just going to go back to the hotel.

197
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,300
No. I don't do another phone call.

198
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Can I call you then?

199
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,000
No.

200
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
- I'm tired.
- What?

201
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm tired.

202
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,700
What's going on?
Look at me.

203
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,000
It's a rape drug.

204
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,300
What?

205
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,600
Rohypnol.

206
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh my God! What!

207
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,600
It causes, droziness, dizziness,
disorientation and memory loss.

208
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,300
Are you kidding?!
What have you done?

209
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,400
Jenny!
God!

210
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
What is it?

211
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
Jenny.

212
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,100
Jenny.

213
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Jenny!

214
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Jenny!
Jenny, wake up!

215
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Jenny!

216
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,700
God!

217
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Jenny.

218
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,100
Lindsay!

219
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,000
Jenny!

220
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,300
What's happening?

221
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,000
What are you doing?

222
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,700
What's this?

223
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,900
What the fuck are you doing to us?

224
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,100
What are you doing?

225
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,600
Jenny!

226
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,300
Let us out!

227
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
My friend ...

228
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
You don't match.

229
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Have to kill you.

230
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Don't take it personally.

231
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,200
What 's this?
What are you doing to us?

232
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,400
What is this?
Stop!

233
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,500
Jenny!

234
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,100
Japanese

235
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,000
Please ...

236
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
It's gonig to be okay.

237
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.

238
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,900
Japanese

239
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:40,000
Retired but still very well known as 
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins.

240
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,500
Japanese

241
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,200
Six months,

242
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,600
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore... 

243
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,000
but creating.

244
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,500
I transformed my three Rottweiler

245
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,300
into a beautiful three hound construction.

246
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Good news!

247
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Your tissues match.

248
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
So ...

249
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,200
I will explain this spectacular operation
once.

250
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
We start ...

251
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,600
 with cutting the ligament patelar.

252
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,400
 The ligaments of the knee caps.

253
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,300
So knee extension...

254
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
is no longer possible.

255
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,700
Pulling from "B" and "C"

256
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,000
The central incisors,
and lateral incisors and Canines.

257
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,500
from the upper and lower jaws...

258
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,100
The lips from"B" and "C"...

259
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,100
and the anus of "A" and "B"...

260
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:59,500
are cut circular along the boarder
between buttock and rectum.

261
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,500
The mucus retains so.

262
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,500
Two pet acellular grafts
 are prepaired

263
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,000
and lifted from the underlining tissue.

264
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
The shape incisions.

265
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,900
Below the chins, of "B" to "C"

266
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,100
up to their cheeks.

267
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,900
Connecting the circular skin parts...

268
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,500
of anus and mouth.

269
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,600
From "A" to "B"
and  "B" to "C".

270
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Connecting...

271
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,000
the pet acellular grafts
to the chin/cheek incisions  .

272
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Creating ...

273
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,200
a siamese triplet...

274
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,700
connected

275
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,800
by the gastrict system.

276
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Ingestion by "A"

277
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,800
past through "B"

278
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,800
and excretion by "C".

279
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
A human centipede.

280
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,700
First sequence.

281
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,600
Here's your breakfast.

282
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Japanese

283
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400

general anesthesia.

284
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,000
Lindsay!

285
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,100
Jenny ...

286
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,200
I want my mom!

287
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,100
German

288
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,800
No!

289
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
<i>Open up!</i>

290
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,500
Please!

291
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,900
Stop!
Why do this?

292
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,100
Open!

293
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Need help!
You're a sick man!

294
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,700
I am a sick man.

295
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,200
<i>HAHAHAHAHA!</i>

296
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,200
If you do not open immediately I will....

297
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,800
cut your knees

298
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,300
<i>and pull your teeth out
one by one!</i>

299
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,400
<i>without anesthesia.</i>

300
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
<i>It's your choice!</i>

301
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
Open the door!

302
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,400
<i>Open the door!</i>

303
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,400
Stop!

304
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,600
No!

305
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,500
Please!
Please!

306
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,800
Why do this?

307
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,200
Let me and Jenny go.

308
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,300
Please.

309
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,900
We'll give you anything.

310
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,100
Anything you want,
just let us go.

311
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,600
Don't worry ...

312
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,100
it's only a tranquilizer 

313
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,400
Keep your head very still.

314
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,300
I don't want to loose one of yout precious eyes.

315
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,300
Just kill me!

316
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,700
Ahhhh.

317
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,000
One of my Rottweilers
tried to flee

318
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,900
just before the operation.

319
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,700
After I caught the dog....

320
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,900
He had to take the middle postion.

321
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
in this postion...

322
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
the healing pains...

323
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,100
are twice as intense.

324
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,900
Do you already regret your little escape.

325
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,500
In fact I'm thankful for it.

326
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,800
Because now I know definitely,
you are...

327
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,800
the middle piece!

328
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,000
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.

329
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,600
Game Over.

330
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,300
Damn.

331
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,500
power is cut of again..

332
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,300
Sorry!

333
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Damn!

334
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,900
I'm so sorry.

335
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,800
Help!

336
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,600
my sweet centipede ...

337
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,400
Looks good.

338
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,700
Heal well.

339
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Suffering will be over soon.

340
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,900
Your in alot of pain, I know.

341
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,200
Nice.

342
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,800
Okay.

343
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,700
better and better.

344
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,100
My Lead ...

345
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,300
My Lead.

346
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,600
Hey, man.

347
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,800
Hey, man.

348
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,900

356
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,000
Japanese

357
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,600
Japanese

358
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,500
Take the newspaper and bring it to me.

359
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Yeah, good boy.

360
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,200

365
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,600

366
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,400
Then let's walk a little.

367
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,200
Japanese

368
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,900
Atention!

369
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,500

You want me to bite?

375
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,100
