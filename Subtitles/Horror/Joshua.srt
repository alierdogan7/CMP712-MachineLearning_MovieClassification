1
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:08,210
(drumroll)

2
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:11,297
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,131
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:42,044
(children laughing and playing)

5
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:00,798
(people cheering)

6
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:06,531
You're playing like
a bunch of little girls!

7
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,272
You're playing like a little girl!

8
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,774
Good, good hustle.

9
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:13,719
Good hustle!

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,052
Hustle!

11
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,420
What? Okay, I'm coming!
Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry.

12
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,255
Excuse me!

13
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,289
We got to go.

14
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:27,290
Sorry.
We've got to go!

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,167
It's an emergency!

16
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:34,305
Come on, come on, buddy.

17
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:37,342
Hey!

18
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:41,370
Joshua, let's go!

19
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:43,306
Let's go, buddy.

20
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:44,574
Josh!

21
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:45,909
Oh...

22
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,919
Ah...

23
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,055
(horn blaring)

24
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:52,314
(baby crying)

25
00:02:56,423 --> 00:03:01,759
(babies fussing and crying)

26
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,239
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

27
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:32,215
Oh, my little worm.

28
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:35,260
Oh, God, I love her so much.

29
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,390
Hello, sweetie.

30
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:42,297
She looks like...

31
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,094
She...

32
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,402
(laughing)

33
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:49,407
(laughter continues)

34
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,867
Look at this little...

35
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,175
(laughing)

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,471
Hey.

37
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:57,314
Did it hurt, Mommy?

38
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:02,582
Oh, yeah, it did, but not anymore.

39
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,886
(piano playing gentle melody)

40
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,758
(piano continues playing)

41
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:15,825
Oh, you did?

42
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,998
- (speaking gibberish)
- (barks)

43
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:20,597
Oh, not you, Buster.

44
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,831
Oh, Buster!

45
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,534
Baby, I thought we were
keeping him locked up.

46
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:25,869
Okay, okay.

47
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,280
You been listening to Bartok?

48
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,816
(playing gentle melody)

49
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,510
I'll see your Bartok

50
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,685
and raise you one
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

51
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:41,351
You hammer any
of these nails yourself?

52
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:43,687
Uh, no, Dad, we had a contractor.

53
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:45,755
I can't imagine what that cost you.

54
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:48,124
Shame, nothing like putting
your own sweat into a home.

55
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:51,968
Oh, there's sweat in here,
believe me.

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,477
HAZEL: By the way it's not rare
to have a grandmother

57
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,904
stay and help with the newborn.

58
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,006
- Oh, no...
- It would be my pleasure.

59
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,407
- No, Hazel.
- (baby fussing)

60
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:06,109
We're fine.

61
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,410
Are you sure, Abby?

62
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,079
Yes, Mom, we'll be fine.

63
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,649
- Because, you should have help.
- (fussing)

64
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,817
No.

65
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:17,490
HAZEL: At least have a nanny.

66
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,556
I mean, isn't that what
rich people do in New York?

67
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,391
- Mom, we're fine, really.
- We're also not crazy

68
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:25,201
about this idea of
a stranger living here.

69
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,964
Well, you would hardly notice me.

70
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,933
(playing stops)

71
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:33,670
These ten little Indians
are all out of arrows.

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,377
Well, I hope you won't
make me sing, Ned.

73
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,643
A glorious light
should shine, Hazel.

74
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:40,977
(Hazel laughing)

75
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,245
You flatterer.

76
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:43,279
NED:
You know, I don't know

77
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,581
if you were interested
in seeing a show.

78
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,882
I can get you tickets.

79
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,752
HAZEL: I only want to see
one of your shows, Ned.

80
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,254
Well, you're three years
too late on that one.

81
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,264
Aw, but what a success.

82
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,158
(begins playing classical piece)

83
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:57,966
Mmm, I suppose.

84
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,831
Oh, this is the piece that he's
playing for the school recital.

85
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:06,261
Uh-huh. Can he play, like,
"Jesus is my Savior" or...

86
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,005
BRAD:
I don't think so, Mom.

87
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,306
Oh, that's a shame.

88
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:13,149
(continues playing)

89
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:16,051
Abby, do you think

90
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:19,049
you could part with that
bundle of joy for just a second?

91
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,950
I need some cuddle time.

92
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,724
Oh!

93
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,826
Oh, precious little lady.

94
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,932
Look at you!

95
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:35,965
Oh, well, she sure has that
solid-as-a-rock Cairn chin,

96
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,467
doesn't she?

97
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,802
JOE:
You can tell she's salt of the earth.

98
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,969
You can just tell.

99
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,746
So, sis... how is everything?

100
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,847
Fine, how are you?

101
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,978
I'm fine, how are you feeling?

102
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,980
I'm feeling fine.
I'm good... I am.

103
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,616
Neddy, I'm good, I'm great even.

104
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:55,418
No blues? No blahs?

105
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:56,820
Nope.

106
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,456
'Cause I have some exquisite
medication I can get you.

107
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,292
(laughs):
No, it's nothing like last time.

108
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,727
Nothing.

109
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,228
Good.

110
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:09,004
(playing grows louder)

111
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:10,834
ABBY:
Joshua.

112
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,969
Do you think we could have
a little intermission?

113
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,604
Hmm?

114
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,073
I wonder how many rats
live in this building?

115
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,108
Joshua.

116
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,375
I'm guessing at least a hundred.

117
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:20,643
Joshua!

118
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:25,056
Do you think we can keep
it quiet for the baby?

119
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,883
(muffled hammering)

120
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,218
HAZEL:
What's that?

121
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,822
Lunch break is probably over.

122
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,889
That's, uh...

123
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,357
that's gut renovation
on the penthouse.

124
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:35,692
JOE:
How charming.

125
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:39,604
You baptizing this one?

126
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,165
Oh, well, you know, since we
didn't baptize Joshua, we're...

127
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,167
ABBY:
Yeah, I think it's time for Lily's nap.

128
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,835
So that's a no to baptism?

129
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:48,371
BRAD:
Uh, I think, you know, we're going to let

130
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,740
our kids make up their
own minds about religion.

131
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,610
Hey, why don't we all
sing Lily a sleep tight song?

132
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,145
ABBY:
Good idea.

133
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:56,946
NED:
Come on, everybody.

134
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:59,584
- Come on.
- All right.

135
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,661
BRAD:
It's going to be okay.

136
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:06,163
It's okay, Ma.

137
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,258
- (single note plays on piano)
- (baby fussing)

138
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:12,637
- (playing piano)
- Twinkle, twinkle, little star

139
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:17,073
How I wonder what you are

140
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:21,773
Up above the world so high

141
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:26,045
Like a diamond in the sky

142
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,911
Twinkle, twinkle...

143
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,287
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my Lord.

144
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,985
Sorry. I'm sorry.

145
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,062
(Joshua retching)

146
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,406
BRAD:
You feeling better?

147
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,063
What's going on over here?

148
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,498
Did you feed Nero today?

149
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,738
Yeah?

150
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,135
Dad?

151
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:53,236
Yeah.

152
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,205
I don't like soccer.

153
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,082
I-I thought I did,

154
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:01,312
and I wanted to...
but I don't.

155
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:04,185
Oh...

156
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,748
Well, you know, that's...

157
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,329
that's okay, you know?

158
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:16,228
I don't like baseball either.

159
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,794
Well, that's all right.

160
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,963
You ch... you do something else.

161
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,438
You can do whatever you want.

162
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:23,466
You know?

163
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,668
Do you ever feel weird, Dad?

164
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:27,370
Weird?

165
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,038
Yeah, yeah, sometimes.

166
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,641
Like if I don't exercise
for a while

167
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,476
or wake up in the middle
of a dream...

168
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:38,446
or have too much
coffee or something.

169
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,984
Do you ever feel weird about me?

170
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,151
(laughs softly)

171
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:45,130
Your weird son?

172
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,324
No.

173
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:51,326
No, no, no, no, not at all.

174
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,437
Not at all.

175
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:55,465
You know that magic trick

176
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,300
where the magician puts
the person in the box

177
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,802
and spins the box
and makes the person disappear?

178
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:00,937
Yeah?

179
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,705
I know how that trick is done.

180
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,541
If you look carefully, you can tell.

181
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,543
Well, you know, hey,
maybe magic is your thing.

182
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,145
We could take you to a magic store.

183
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,155
Get you some tricks.

184
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,421
You know, you don't have to love me.

185
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,552
That's not like a rule or something.

186
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:17,654
But I do love you.

187
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:18,955
You're my son. You're my boy.

188
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:22,025
I'll always love you,
no matter what.

189
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,667
Okay?

190
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,543
(static clicking softly)

191
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:43,956
(low breathy sound over monitor)

192
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:47,016
Brad.

193
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:48,584
BRAD:
Mm?

194
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:49,585
Brad.

195
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:50,987
Hmm?

196
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,221
Do you hear that?

197
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,623
Hmm? What?

198
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,725
I think there's someone
in the baby's room.

199
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,060
(static clicking softly)

200
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,162
No, that's static, sweetie.

201
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,964
No, there's someone in Lily's room.

202
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,266
Abby, wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

203
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,368
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

204
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,703
Sweetie?

205
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,045
Abby.

206
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:12,174
Damn it.

207
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,551
She's breathing, right?

208
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,918
She's fine, sweetie.

209
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,556
She's fine.

210
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:28,031
I thought she was choking
or something.

211
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,194
It's amazing how tiny they are.

212
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:33,939
ABBY:
It's almost heartbreaking.

213
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,696
(piano music begins playing
classical piece)

214
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:02,501
(piano continues playing)

215
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,832
(baby cooing)

216
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,270
Hey, did you walk the dog?

217
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,745
Okay, let's roll, little man.

218
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,176
(mumbles)

219
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,911
(baby fussing)

220
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,279
Oh.

221
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,450
Oh, don't cry.

222
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,517
(piano continues playing)

223
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:30,253
Um, yeah, put it on the...
put it on the desk.

224
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,554
All right, thanks a lot.

225
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,022
Listen, hey, I'm running late.

226
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,296
I got to... Okay.

227
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,826
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

228
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:38,594
High five. Down low.

229
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,402
Two. Hey, hey, come on.

230
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:42,732
You all right?

231
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,200
Okay.

232
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,210
I'll see you later.

233
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:48,838
Hey!

234
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,823
(continues playing
classical piece)

235
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,594
Did you solve them all already?

236
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:06,563
(piano continues playing)

237
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:11,256
And ten million's the minimum
for this particular fund.

238
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,930
Of course... of course
we would love your support,

239
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,231
but ten is the number.

240
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:16,933
It's not six.

241
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,234
(mumbles)

242
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,303
(whispers)

243
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,840
Yeah.

244
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,819
(piano continues playing)

245
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,916
(slide projector clicks)

246
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:35,016
WOMAN:
Okay, now let's

247
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,220
take a moment talking
about how and why

248
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,088
these ancient people
embalmed their dead.

249
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:40,256
BOY:
Mummies?

250
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,291
Yes, mummies.

251
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,476
(laughs)

252
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,845
Oh, you're like a bird
trapped in a garage.

253
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,380
Yeah. That's...

254
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,048
Come on.
Serve.

255
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,884
(whistle blows)

256
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,863
(piano continues playing)

257
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:24,739
(piano continues playing)

258
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,223
(door opening)

259
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,258
(piano playing stops)

260
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:44,620
(resumes playing,
finishes piece)

261
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,630
(keys clattering)

262
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,467
(Brad humming)

263
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,038
Hey.

264
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,430
Hey, I didn't see you there.

265
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,898
ABBY:
Brad...

266
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:57,500
- BRAD: Sweetie, I'm...
- It ricochets.

267
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,734
I'm cultured, I swear.

268
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,336
- (laughing)
- See?

269
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,904
(baby coos)

270
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:04,212
God.

271
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,075
You know,
someone died in this apartment.

272
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,243
BRAD:
Oh, yeah?

273
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,949
Really?

274
00:15:10,056 --> 00:15:12,381
I-I-I... I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

275
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,416
If you think
about it,

276
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,523
someone has died

277
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,288
on pretty much every inch
of this planet.

278
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:21,991
You know, dig down anywhere,
and you'll find bones.

279
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,292
(Abby laughs)

280
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,494
ABBY:
I don't know. I think you...

281
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:28,464
We'd probably know if
someone was killed here.

282
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,966
I didn't say killed.

283
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,809
Why do you think killed?

284
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,904
Do you have that sense, too?

285
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:36,872
(Brad chewing loudly)

286
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:39,077
Nobody died here, man.

287
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:40,376
Are you sure?

288
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:41,711
ABBY (laughing):
I'm pretty sure.

289
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,012
Kind of sure.

290
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:44,180
(baby cooing)

291
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,481
What? Tell him about it.

292
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:46,682
(talking gibberish)

293
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,320
Tell him about your shots.

294
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:50,987
She had her shots today.

295
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:52,121
BRAD:
Oh, yeah?

296
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,556
Yeah. She was so good.

297
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:54,991
- I was a mess, however.
- Ah...

298
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,792
Oh, you poor thing.

299
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,012
What was I like as a baby?

300
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:00,263
BRAD:
You were great.

301
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:01,330
You were... you were very, uh...

302
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,566
You had a lot of... spirit.

303
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:05,468
- (clears throat)
- (laughs)

304
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:07,203
You certainly knew
what you wanted,

305
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,504
that's for sure.

306
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,805
What did I want?

307
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,374
Ah...

308
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:13,784
We could never tell.

309
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,514
But I was all right?

310
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,080
You...

311
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,448
Yeah.

312
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,750
ABBY (laughing):
You were fine.

313
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,351
BRAD:
You were great.

314
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,619
You really were.

315
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,689
You were a good kid.

316
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,258
(baby crying)

317
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:07,330
BRAD: Oh, yes, here we are
with Joshua, eight days old.

318
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,798
BRAD:
Mommy... and son.

319
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,300
ABBY:
Brad, what are you doing?

320
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,737
BRAD (upper crust accent): I'm just trying
to get a slice of life here, you see.

321
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:15,905
Well, not now.

322
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,473
Please just get out of here.

323
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,141
(shushing baby)

324
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,211
BRAD: Mommy's very tired,
very tired, and she's trying to...

325
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,546
ABBY:
Brad, fuck off.

326
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:26,182
BRAD:
Just give a little... Okay. Okay.

327
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,483
Just leave me alone right now.

328
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,784
BRAD:
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

329
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,152
(baby crying)

330
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,987
BRAD (whispers):
I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop.

331
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,090
BRAD:
And here we are behind the scenes

332
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,525
- with Brad and Abby Cairn.
- (baby crying and screaming)

333
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:37,693
- Hello, Mommy!
- Brad...

334
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:39,228
BRAD:
Okay, okay, okay...

335
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:40,663
- (baby screams)
- BRAD: Ow!

336
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:42,198
ABBY:
Get out!

337
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,472
(baby crying)

338
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,577
(Abby sniffles)

339
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,812
(baby crying)

340
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,143
(Abby inhales deeply)

341
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,417
ABBY:
I'm fine, I'm fine.

342
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:59,582
(crying):
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

343
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm fine.

344
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,786
(exhales loudly)

345
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:07,723
(whispers): I'm fine. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.

346
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,028
(Abby sniffles, baby cries)

347
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:14,565
(baby crying)

348
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:17,066
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

349
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,101
(baby crying)

350
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,048
(loud static)

351
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,150
(volume increases)

352
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,380
(crowd murmuring)

353
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,982
(laughing):
What's going on with you?

354
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,620
MAN:
Hey, it's the new parents.

355
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,720
- BRAD: Hey, how you been?
- Brad!

356
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,688
BRAD:
Fred, Ruth, how you guys doing? Hey...

357
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,490
- Hello, Abernathys.
- WOMAN: Hello.

358
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,658
Where you guys been?

359
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:43,993
- South Africa.
- BRAD: Oh, nice.

360
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:45,728
My mother finally died.

361
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:46,896
Oh, sorry.

362
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,097
The weather was unbelievable.

363
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,132
I caught the biggest
shark you've ever seen.

364
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:52,101
- Mm. Really...?
- WOMAN: So, how's the new girl?

365
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,269
It's Lily, right?

366
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,570
ABBY:
Yeah. She's good.

367
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,238
You look fabulous.

368
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:57,506
- Yeah.
- BRAD: No kidding.

369
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,308
- Thank you.
- BRAD: What do you use for...?

370
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,110
- Well, you finally had another. That's great.
- Yeah.

371
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,345
MAN: It took me three hours
to bring in that shark.

372
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:04,513
Hey, how's Tommy?

373
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,081
Well, we'll see. Uh...

374
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,550
The trumpet was a real mistake.

375
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,018
There is a reason

376
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,086
- that nobody plays the trumpet.
- (laughter)

377
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:14,323
So, are we all prepared for
an hour of unspeakable music?

378
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,458
Speak for your own child.

379
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:19,895
I tell you, two kids really
changes everything, huh?

380
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,530
- (Abby clears throat)
- MAN: Try three.

381
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,698
(laughs)

382
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,333
All right, we'll see you out there.

383
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:25,668
- Okay.
- Break a leg.

384
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:27,678

385
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:28,904
(sighs)

386
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,306
I hate these people.

387
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,575
(whispers)
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, keep it down.

388
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,076
(sighs):
Are we these people?

389
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,377
It's just a school, baby.

390
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,545
Hey, bullshit.

391
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,113
It is not just a school.

392
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,782
- It's a way of life.
- Shh, shh.

393
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,151
And we're smack dab
in the middle of it.

394
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,161
- Hi.
- Hey.

395
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,323
(sighs)

396
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,891
(whispers):
There he is.

397
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,125
Sorry, I'm late, sis.

398
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,360
Yeah, whatever.

399
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,862
You're right on time.

# Ave Maria #

403

Little Star" fluidly)

408

What's he doing?

409
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:00,729
(plays a wrong note)

410
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,105
Uh, I don't know.

418
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:27,692
(plays fluidly)

419
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,690

discordant notes)

420
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,104
(plays more discordant notes)

421
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,969
(plays many atonal notes)

422
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,506
BRAD:
This is... This is...

423
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:47,236
This is all...
This is all wrong.

424
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,012
No. Actually, I think he's...

425
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,616
he's hitting every note.

426
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:55,125
(playing atonal music)

427
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:00,864

(plays atonal music
loudly and confidently)

430
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,577
(music crescendos)

431
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,490
ABBY:
Joshua? Oh,Joshua...

432
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,135

panicked voices)

Excuse me!

BRAD:
You all right?

436
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,001
Hey, hey.

437
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,169
- ABBY: You okay?
- You're okay.

438
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,504
He's okay.
You okay, buddy?

439
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:49,805
Say something.

440
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,607
- You okay?
- Come on, buddy, let's go.

441
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:53,475
Bring him...Just let me bring him.

442
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:56,345
MAN:
First I thought he was kidding around with...

443
00:22:56,355 --> 00:22:59,916
(sighs heavily)

444
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,850
What were you doing up there?

445
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,719
You were probably just nervous, huh?

446
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:05,020
NED:
Hey,

447
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,890
I threw up the first time
I ever went on stage.

- Hey, hey, hey.

450
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,194
Goddamn it.

451
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:14,963
Will you not drive like
a fucking idiot, please?!

452
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:17,498
(sighs)

453
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,609

Honey, honey, honey.

Honey, honey, honey, honey.

- What's wrong?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

465
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,138
Nothing. She just started crying.

466
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,606
- What did you do?
- Shh, shh.

467
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:58,807
I didn't do anything. I...

468
00:23:58,817 --> 00:24:00,142
Well, she's fine.

469
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:02,244
- I fed her not too long ago.
- Shh, shh, shh.

470
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:03,946
- Here... No, no, no.

- She's fine.
- What's going on with her?

474
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:11,253
Is it night terrors or something?
What's happening?

475
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,021
No. She's fine,
she's fine, she's fine.

476
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:14,189
She doesn't like it...

477
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,858
She likes it when you
support her h...

478
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,292
She's fine, she's fine.
I'm fine, okay?!

479
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:18,460
I can handle this.

480
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,466
Just go to bed!

481
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:22,770
(baby crying)

482
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:25,734
Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Come on, baby...

-Jesus.

486
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,714
Oh God, you scared the...

487
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:40,720
tar out of me.

488
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,451
Everything all right?

489
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:45,589
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

490
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:46,855
How're you feeling?

491
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,857
You feel, you feel better?

492
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,325
She's crying.

493
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,994
Yes, she is.

494
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,162
(chuckles)

495
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:56,317
Come on, buddy,
back to bed, let's go.

496
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,738
(baby crying)

497
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,570
So how long has she been crying now?

498
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,576
- Uh, five days.
- Hmm.

499
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,074
Yeah, she has a slight diaper rash.

500
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:07,509
You think that, that's it?

501
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,178
- Could that be it?
- Well...

502
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:10,779
you know, um...

503
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,280
some babies just like to cry.

504
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,883
- (crying continues)
- Yeah.

505
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:16,889
Here you go.

506
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:18,891
(crying continues)

507
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:20,893
Not this, not again.

508
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:22,895
Not, not this one.

509
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:24,893
You know, she was,
she was perfect

510
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,899
until five days ago.

511
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:28,897
Maybe she just has a lot to say.

512
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,899
- (crying continues)
- Okay.

513
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,001
Could you take her for a second?

514
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,011
Yeah, sure.

515
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,047
(crying continues)

516
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:01,206

519
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:42,473
(rock on headphones)

520
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,927
Where have you been?

521
00:26:57,896 --> 00:26:59,896
Hey, what's...

522
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:01,998
(baby crying)

523
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,226
What is that, is that the,
is that the baby

524
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:05,560
- or the dog?
- Or me?

525
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,895
- What?
- Take a deep breath, Brad.

526
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,230
That's our life you're smelling.

527
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,464
Give me the binky.

528
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:10,532
Wait.

529
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,136
Good God, ma...

530
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,509
Mommy's upset, huh?

531
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:18,273
- (crying continues)
- Oh, no, little baby.

532
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,942
Look we have the binky.

533
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,610
The binky's here.

534
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,945
There's the binky.

535
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,046
Yeah.

536

Shh, shh, shh, shh,

538
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:40,701
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

540
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,569
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

541
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,575
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

542
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,581
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

543
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,396
(door creaking)

544
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,602
Hey, pal.

545
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,604
Hi.

546
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,102
What's going on here?

547
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:21,436
What are you...

548
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,438
what are you doing
with all your stuff?

549
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,444
I'm giving it away,

550
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,442
- to the poor.
- (chuckles)

551
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:29,511
You're giving it away to the poor?

552
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,346
Every one of your toys?

553
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,189
Josh...

554
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:37,285
You know, these,
these toys aren't cheap.

555
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,291
I'm starting over.

556
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,389
Starting over?

557
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,523
From what?

558
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:42,691
Mom said I could.

559
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:45,261
Mom said you could.

560
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,634
Uh-huh.

561
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:50,265
Yeah, of course she did, well...

562
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:53,244
at least you're keeping Pandy.

563
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,706
Dad, is Mommy all right?

564
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,813
Yeah, yeah,

565
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:02,815
she's just tired, pal.

566
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,817
Why do you ask?

567
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,819
Nothing.

568
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,617
Lily asleep?

569
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:10,619
Yeah, I got her to fall asleep.

570
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:11,787
Pretty good, huh?

571
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:13,789
You're better at it than Mommy.

572
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,357
(laughs)

573
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:16,892
I'm not sure about that.

574
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:18,493
You are. Really.

575
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:20,529
What's going on with your hair here?

576
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:23,198
Huh, what is it, made of plastic?

577
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,700
Hey, I know things have
been kind of stressful

578
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,502
around here lately.

579
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:30,481
It can't be easy for you.

580
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,146
You okay?

581
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,144
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

582
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:38,146
What are you...
what are you doing?

583
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:39,314
In Egypt,

584
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:41,316
when they embalmed
people, like pharaohs,

585
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:43,318
they broke the nose
and removed the brain

586
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,324
through the opening.

587
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:46,822
Ahh.

588
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:48,824
(chuckling):
Josh, that's...

589
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,826
They drained the body
of all its fluid

590
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:53,100
on a special stone slab.

591
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,763
Josh...

592
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:56,598
Josh,Josh,

593
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,266
Josh, wh-wh-why are you doing that?

594
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,935
Why... don't...

595
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:03,345
This guarantees him
a glorious afterlife.

596
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:09,220
(humming)

597
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,115
They chanted
something, too,

598
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,183
but I'm making that part up.

599
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:17,193
(grunting)

600
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:19,258
Filthy animal.

601
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:21,256
You filthy, filthy animal.

602
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,325
Oh...

603
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:25,435
That's right.

604
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,631
You're a disgusting dog.

605
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,064
(panting)

606
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,899
No, no, Brad!

607
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:32,734
- Huh?
- Buster.

608
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:33,902
No!

609
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,070
What's wrong?

610
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,671
- (barking)
- All right, come on, come on.

611
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,839
Come on, Buster.

612
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,849
Let's go, come on.

613
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:46,497
I mean can't your parents take him?

614
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,050
No.

615
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,056
They can't take him.

616
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,387
(sobbing)

617
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,397
What's wrong, sweetie?

618
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,759
Nice that everything is quiet.

619
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,261
Ugh, are you kidding me?

620
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,267
I still hear her echo.

621
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,765
Sweetie, what's, what's going on?

622
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,400
You okay?

623
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,406
I love you bunches.

624
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,904
I love ya.

625
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,071
(sighs)

626
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:11,806
Sweetie.

627
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:13,808
Look at this, this is beautiful.

628
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:16,678
All right, come on, that's my side.

629
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:18,113
Let's go.

630
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:19,548
I'm gonna take a look at this.

631
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:21,416
Let me get, let me get
a little slice of this.

632
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,951
(sighing):
Please.

633
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,119
Don't worry
about Lily,

634
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,620
I'm gonna feed her tonight, okay.

635
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,789
Okay, but you have
to warm the breast milk.

636
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,799
No problem.

637
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:33,495
You look so good.

638
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:34,996
Look at this, voluptuous.

639
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:36,331
This is so nice.

640
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:38,333
That's Latin for fat pig.

641
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:40,669
No, baby, this is
just good clean fun.

642
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,003
This is beautiful.

643
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:43,672
It's love.

644
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,678
Come on, sweetie.

645
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:47,680
Not in the mood, huh?

646
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,587
Oh, we can't have sex anyway.

647
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,681
Well, we can do other things.

648
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,687
You know, like...

649
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:56,351
- (skittering upstairs)
- stuff.

650
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,686
You know...

651
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,853
Do you hear that?

652
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:00,859
What?

653
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,024
I think someone's upstairs.

654
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:05,193
Yeah, well, maybe
it's the owners

655
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:06,861
checking up on the progress.

656
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:08,697
At 1 0:30?

657
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,565
You know I love the
smell of your pits.

658
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,000
- Brad...
- Maybe it's rats, I don't know.

659
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,435
Maybe, there's got
to be a hundred

660
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:14,703
in this building.

661
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:16,204
- Don't worry about it.
- No, not now, okay.

662
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:18,679
May-- Maybe soon but not now.

663
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,649
Okay.

664
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,655
- (sighs)
- (exhales)

665
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,567
(distant phone rings)

666
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,669
(exhales)

667
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,839
Hey!

668
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,842
Not good, huh?

669
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:47,769
No, no, it was...

670
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,437
It was an aggressive position,

671
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,705
but it'll work out.

672
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,674
- I hope.
- Hey, I got to take off

673
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:53,842
- early.
- Yeah?

674
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,010
Yeah.

675
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,944
Reason?

676
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,612
Teacher-parent meeting.

677
00:32:57,622 --> 00:32:58,880
Send the nanny,

678
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,881
that's what I do.

679
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:01,249
(laughing):
That's funny.

680
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:02,651
Not a joke.

681
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:06,087
It'll be up a point
by the time the market closes.

682
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:07,255
Now that is a joke.

683
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,990
It's... I'll see you tomorrow.

684
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,225
(chuckles)

685
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:13,204
Thanks, pal.

686
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:16,598
(baby crying)

687
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,608
(Abby sighs)

688
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,053
(mumbling):
I don't know.

689
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,777
- I don't know what it is.
- Mmm.

690
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:31,252
You pick her up
and she cries,

691
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:33,281
you put her down and she cries.

692
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,287
I don't know.

693
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:37,352
I don't know why you just
don't hire a nanny.

694
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:39,487
Get Mary Poppins for Christ's sake.

695
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:41,756
Did Brad put you up to this?

696
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,591
No.

697
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:45,093
I'm just saying you need a break.

698
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,629
Go... shopping, go out to dinner.

699
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,964
Go get a hotel room and take a nap.

700
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:51,966
Just get out of here
for a little while.

701
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:53,268
It'll do everybody some good.

702
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,438
I could never leave her
with anybody else.

703
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,973
Have you spoken to your shrink?

704
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:00,979
So sick of shrinks.

705
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:04,045
I've given them 1 7 years,
what have they given me?

706
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:05,213
A migraine.

707
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:06,648
I'm just saying
you got to stay

708
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:07,949
on top of these things.

709
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:10,285
Speaking from personal experience.

710
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:13,355
I mean, I'm a little worried here.

711
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:16,366
(distant baby crying)

712
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,464
Look at this.

713
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,700
Look at this, maybe I'm...

714
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,525
maybe I'm not providing for her.

715
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,921
Well, that's quite a device.

716
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:29,471
It looks like you're giving
oxygen to your tit.

717
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,540
Shut up.

718
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,007
Oh, I was kidding.

719
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:34,175
No, you shut up!

720
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:35,844
Oh, please.

721
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:37,846
- (crying)
- I was kidding.

722
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:41,257
Look, it's not all that bad.

723
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,355
And it's... shh.

724
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:45,019
It's gonna get better.

725
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:46,588
This is the slog.

726
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:48,123
This is the slog, right?

727
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,625
Soon enough our little
Lily's gonna be adorable

728
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,628
and all of this is
gonna be forgotten.

729
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,638
(crying stops)

730
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,210
See.

731
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,214
ABBY:
Oh, God, please.

732
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:09,648
Hi, honey.

733
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:11,312
Joshua, my boy.

734
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,348
Can I go out for a bit, Mom?

735
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,953
- Sure.
- Off to bury the evidence, huh?

736
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,053
ABBY:
Where are you going?

737
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,922
I have some more toys for Goodwill.

738
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:24,927
Okay, but just come home
right afterwards, yeah?

739
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,055
You let him walk the
streets by himself,

740
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:33,234
at nine years old?

741
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,569
Oh, come on.

742
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,905
I mean, does he seem like
your typical nine-year-old?

743
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,915
Yeah, I suppose not.

744
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:45,346
BRAD:
<i>Mrs., uh...</i>

745
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,148
DANFORTH:
<i>Ms. Danforth.</i>

746
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:48,316
<i>Ms. Danforth, hi.</i>

747
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,551
<i>- Yes, hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

748
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,718
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

749
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:52,287
<i>Oh, no that's fine.</i>

750
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,455
<i>I, uh...</i>

751
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,356
got tied up.

752
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:56,858
Hey, which one's his desk?

753
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,293
Oh, it's right here.

754
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,794
Front and center.

755
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,696
Oh, well, that's good,
eager beaver, huh?

756
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,031
(giggles)

757
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,933
Um... yeah.

758
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:06,501
Oh, um,

759
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:08,069
can I ask a question, Ms. Danforth?

760
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,404
Yes, Mr. Cairn.

761
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,406
- (giggles)
- (chuckles)

762
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,412
Joshua, he's, uh...

763
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,909
How smart is he?

764
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,579
Well, this might be getting
ahead of ourselves,

765
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,614
but we think Joshua
might benefit

766
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:20,782
by skipping a grade,

767
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,617
maybe two.

768
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:24,623
Hmm.

769
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,621
Yeah, we're so different.

770
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:28,627
Me and my son.

771
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:29,958
My son and I...

772
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:32,493
I-I-I, uh...

773
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,662
You know, I'd probably
be the kid in the class

774
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:38,157
who picked on him
'cause he was different.

775
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:42,478
Hey, where are the
animals in the...?

776
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,406
Oh, a couple of weeks
ago, they all died.

777
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:48,317
It was a horrible day.

778
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:50,445
Oh, that is horrible.
What happened?

779
00:36:50,455 --> 00:36:54,516
We think maybe there was
a fungus in the food pellets.

780
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:57,461
We've contacted the manufacturer.

781
00:36:57,562 --> 00:37:02,407
In fact, we're using it as
an exercise in consumer rights.

782
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
(baby crying)

783
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,670
(crying continues)

784
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:14,143
(crying)

785
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:30,252
(glass breaking)

786
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:35,487
Clumsy, Abby.

787
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:38,892
Yeah, she's so clumsy
when she's tired.

788
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:57,846
Mm-hmm.

789
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,949
You were right.

790
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:03,152
There are ghosts here.

791
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:08,537
Everywhere there are ghosts.

792
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,088
Um...

793
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:16,965
Joshua, um,

794
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,068
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

795
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,762
I'm sorry.

796
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,865
Come here.

797
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:25,636
(glass crunching, gasps)

798
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:29,543
Oh.

799
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:37,512
Oh... oh, God.

800
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,217
Poor, clumsy Abby.

801
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:48,925
(glass drops)

802
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,160
Oh.

803
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:52,860
Oh, I feel it.

804
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,204
You know, and it
feels kind of prickly.

805
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:01,677
Hmm.

806
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:05,681
Oh... oh, yeah.

807
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:09,523
You know, I used to have
a pair of red boots.

808
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:13,253
My God, they were so sexy.

809
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:39,307
- (door closes)
- Hey.

810
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:41,376
Hey. How are you, sis?

811
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,311
I'm so glad you could come.

812
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,321
15 stitches.

813
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,325
She's a trooper.

814
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,820
I can, I can stay.

815
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,055
No, no, no, go home.

816
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:55,656
Go home, we'll be fine.

817
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,961
We're good, get some sleep.

818
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:00,361
I'll see you later.

819
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:04,205
(piano plays)

820
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,632
(door opens)

821
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,866
BRAD:
Hello?

822
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,876
(door closes)

823
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,975
(keys rattle)

824
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,740
Hey, hey, buddy.

825
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,049
What you doing?

826
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:52,213
Huh?

827
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:54,319
Scoot over.

828
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:55,817
Is Mommy going to get better?

829
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:56,818
Yes, she will.

830
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:59,633
Look what I got.
I got you a book.

831
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,098
<i>Valley of the Kings.</i>

832
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Pretty cool, huh?

833
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:06,594
You like that?

834
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:08,429
Thank you so much.

835
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,669
You're welcome so much.

836
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:12,834
You know, people
say the Met,

837
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,001
but the Brooklyn Museum's

838
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:16,103
the place to go for Egyptian art.

839
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,206
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

840
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:20,308
Your father's a wealth
of information.

841
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:22,310
You didn't know that, did you?

842
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,360
Maybe we'll go sometime.

843
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:28,282
Hey, there she is.

844
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:29,450
Hi, sweetie.

845
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,118
- How are ya?
- How're you doing?

846
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:32,453
I'm good.
You look tired.

847
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:33,788
- Oh.
- (mumbles gibberish)

848
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:35,289
(laughs)

849
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:36,958
How are they doing?

850
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:38,526
Good and it's fine here.

851
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:40,127
Everything is quiet.

852
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:42,942
Lily settled down, Abby's in bed.

853
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,632
You should take a nap, too.

854
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:46,367
- Yeah.
- It's the weekend, for heaven sakes.

855
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,302
Go on and get some sleep.

856
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:49,737
I appreciate you
coming all this way.

857
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:51,806
Please, will you go have a rest?

858
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,541
Thanks, but I'm not tired.

859
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:57,112
- Look, I'm here so you can relax.
- Okay.

860
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,849
ABBY:
Hazel, I don't need another goddamn thing.

861
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,484
Hey, hey, hey, ooh.

862
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,494
Slow down. It's me.

863
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:08,957
How's your foot?

864
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:12,126
It's fine.

865
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:13,561
Are you pumping?

866
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:14,896
Yeah, I'm pumping.

867
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:16,564
You know,
if your saint of a mother's

868
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:18,566
going to be feeding
Lily at night,

869
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:20,568
she's going to need some milk.

870
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,603
Abby...

871
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,172
Don't take Lily away from me.

872
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:27,074
Of course not, of course
I'm not going to take her...

873
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,644
She needs me, not some
dried up old sponge.

874
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:31,650
Abby, Abby, Abby.

875
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,656
Sweetie.

876
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:35,919
Y-you...

877
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:38,853
Let's all try to get along,
you know what I mean?

878
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:40,990
Come on.

879
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:42,823
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

880
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,258
She's here to help.

881
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:46,093
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

882
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:48,228
I got your prescriptions.

883
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:55,674
This is for your foot,

884
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,544
and this is going to make you...

885
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:00,374
feel better.

886
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:03,444
It'll help your, uh...

887
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,554
You know what I mean?

888
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:10,494
Can I breast-feed?

889
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:14,455
No.

890
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:17,127
No, sweetie,
but this is,

891
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:18,559
this is just a hurdle.

892
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:20,594
Abby, you know, once you get
over this hurdle,

893
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,697
you can ease off the medication.

894
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:24,065
You can start breast-feeding again.

895
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:26,400
It's just a few weeks,
maybe a month.

896
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,410
That's all.

897
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:34,442
I'm going to take care
of everything, you know?

898
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:36,444
I'm going to take
care of the laundry.

899
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:37,878
I'm going to take care of Lily.

900
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,714
Don't you worry.

901
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:42,818
Okay?

902
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:44,218
Mommy, Daddy?

903
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,321
Hey, sport.

904
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,255
I'm going to go and walk the dog.

905
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:49,590
Okay, sport.

906
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,359
Just around the block.

907
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:53,728
-JOSHUA: Mommy, Daddy?
- Yeah?

908
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:55,738
I love you.

909
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:06,846
When did you start
calling him "sport"?

910
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:12,654
(keyboard clacking)

911
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,876
(clears throat):
Hey.

912
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:45,046
- Tough week, huh?
- Yeah.

913
00:45:45,056 --> 00:45:46,113
(blows raspberry)

914
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:47,314
I think it's getting better.

915
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:50,418
I mean, Lily's slowly
figuring life out.

916
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:51,852
And I think Abby's
starting to see

917
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,320
the light at the end of the tunnel.

918
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,422
I don't know.

919
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:55,723
Excuse me?

920
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:58,930
I mean, all in all, I'm positive.

921
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:01,028
Oh, well, I am so relieved.

922
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:03,531
See I thought
we were losing money

923
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,799
hand over fist.

924
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:06,634
I thought we were
on the verge

925
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:09,703
of losing a year's gains
in the matter of a month.

926
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,205
I thought we were fucked.

927
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:13,541
But as long
as everybody's happy

928
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:16,177
at home, then I just--
I feel so much better.

929
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:18,712
Okay, uh, I know it looks bad.

930
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:19,980
It is bad!

931
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,149
Our long is looking short!

932
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:23,684
Okay, okay.
But we've got to sit tight.

933
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:25,052
It's just a little sell-off

934
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:27,655
and then it'll be a big buyback.

935
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:31,396
It's gonna work out, Chester.

936
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:34,130
It's gonna get better.

937
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:42,203
Hazel, you don't have to do that.

938
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,071
Oh, I enjoy it.

939
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:47,482
I'm having a grand old time.

940
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:50,053
And where is Lily?

941
00:46:50,154 --> 00:46:52,622
- Napping.
- Oh.

942
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,198
(muttering)

943
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:10,273
(distant pounding, whirring)

944
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:22,451
(racquetball bouncing)

945
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:26,913
(cell phone ringing)

946
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:31,385
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

947
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,625
Sorry.

948
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:35,856
(phone continues ringing)

949
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:42,137
Yeah?

950
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:14,169
(door unlocks)

951
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:20,534
Where, where is he?

952
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:23,012
He's in the kitchen, sweetie.

953
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:30,819
(bag drops)

954
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:41,389
(sobbing):
Oh, Buster.

955
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,358
Hey, pal.

956
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:48,031
(sniffling)

957
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:52,006
Oh, no.

958
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:56,171
(sobbing)

959
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:09,716
(imitating Brad):
Oh, Buster.

960
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:16,027
(sniffling):
Hey, pal.

961
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:19,994
No!

962
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:23,940
(sobbing)

963
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:32,773
Well, what should we do for food?

964
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:33,874
I-I don't know.

965
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:35,609
I'm not going into that kitchen.

966
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:36,610
They'll be here soon.

967
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,379
Did he eat anything in the park?

968
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:43,349
Joshua? Hey.

969
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,086
Did-did he eat anything in the park?

970
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:49,224
Anything peculiar at all?

971
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,991
No.

972
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:53,806
And then you took him right home?

973
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:55,929
(snapping fingers):
Josh?

974
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:57,931
- Did you take him right home?
- Yeah.

975
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,937
(Lily begins crying)

976
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:02,436
Did you give him anything at all?

977
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:04,004
Did you give him anything?

978
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:05,372
Brad, he was an old dog.

979
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:11,651
Every dog has its day, and
Buster had a shitty fucking day.

980
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,380
(doorbell buzzing)

981
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,249
Join the club.

982
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:17,318
(Lily crying)

983
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:21,023
(doorbell buzzing)

984
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:35,369
Wait, wait, wait.

985
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:37,870
(unzipping)

986
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:42,077
We should keep this.

987
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:45,119
(Lily crying)

988
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:57,429
(Lily crying over monitor)

989
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:02,270
(thumping and pounding overhead)

990
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,215
Brad?

991
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:15,709
Yeah, sweetie?

992
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:17,978
You have to come home right now.

993
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:20,247
They're coming through the ceiling.

994
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:22,249
(drilling and hammering)

995
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:24,284
Hmm?

996
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:27,592
They're coming through the ceiling.

997
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,429
Hi!

998
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,968
Hi, sweetie.

999
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:40,234
We have to hurry.

1000
00:51:40,244 --> 00:51:42,244
Okay.

1001
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,910
W-where is it?
Is it in the bathroom?

1002
00:51:53,724 --> 00:51:55,983
I don't understand. Is it...

1003
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:59,861
Uh... I'm sorry? Where?

1004
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:09,205
Shit.

1005
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:12,303
Uh-huh.

1006
00:52:12,313 --> 00:52:13,634
There's nothing?

1007
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,644
No, I mean, uh...

1008
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,539
There's a crack up there,
but I mean,

1009
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:19,940
that crack has been there forever.

1010
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:21,950
Is everything okay?

1011
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:25,345
Because I've got to...

1012
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:29,189
I've got to be at Midtown...
for the...

1013
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:30,951
- (sobbing)
- What's going on?

1014
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:34,522
Look at me.

1015
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:36,023
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1016
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:39,366
It's okay, but now I've got to go.

1017
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,466
(sighing)

1018
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,838
Sweetie.

1019
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,466
I'm so sorry.

1020
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:46,667
I'm sorry.

1021
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:47,801
I love our kids.

1022
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:50,109
I love our kids, too.

1023
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:12,526
Reach to Him, the hand
that is always there!

1024
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,536
The hand of Jesus.

1025
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,096
He is always there!

1026
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:19,303
Reach to Him
and He will embrace you!

1027
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:21,235
He will prepare you.

1028
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:24,838
He will arm you
with the sword of righteousness

1029
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:28,944
so you will not have
to fight this battle alone!

1030
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:35,051
(sawing and hammering)

1031
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:43,729
(sawing and hammering
grows louder)

1032
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:46,598
We have big news.

1033
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:48,161
Good news.

1034
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:49,162
What is it?

1035
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:51,031
Joshua.

1036
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:53,100
I want to get born again.

1037
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,101
(laughing)

1038
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:55,569
You what?

1039
00:53:55,579 --> 00:54:00,380
I took Joshua to
a prayer meeting today

1040
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:02,509
and he was touched by the spirit.

1041
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,177
Weren't you, son?

1042
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:06,780
And he wants to get
right with Christ.

1043
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,049
Well, too bad his mom
is a big, fat Jew.

1044
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,183
Mom.

1045
00:54:10,193 --> 00:54:12,819
Well, his father is
a proud, strong Christian.

1046
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:14,488
And Joshua made this
decision for himself.

1047
00:54:14,498 --> 00:54:16,023
Mom...

1048
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:18,292
- I'm-I'm sorry, but that's not happening.
- No.

1049
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:20,127
Well, you said it was his decision.

1050
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:23,897
And he's old enough now
to make that decision.

1051
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:25,465
Mom, I think we have some say.

1052
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:27,734
Well, you said
that it was his decision.

1053
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,136
- ABBY: You fucking bitch.
- Mom.

1054
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,804
- Abby, Abby, Abby.
- No, no, no, no.

1055
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:32,239
No! No!
No child of mine

1056
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:34,474
is going to grow up to be
a goddamn Evangelical nut case.

1057
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:35,475
Okay, okay.

1058
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:36,810
Okay, Abby.

1059
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,545
No! You've been whispering
poison into his ears.

1060
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:40,514
You fucking narrow-minded
medieval scold.

1061
00:54:40,524 --> 00:54:41,582
Abby! Abby!

1062
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:44,151
You know, Abby,
I feel sorry for you.

1063
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,752
That motherhood is such a chore.

1064
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:46,753
You know what?

1065
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:48,488
Get out of my house!

1066
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:51,892
Okay, okay, let's-let's turn down
the volume a little bit here, okay?

1067
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,193
You know, maybe
you should try Christ

1068
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:54,428
instead of all those pills.

1069
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:55,929
You know what? Get out!

1070
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,764
Ow!

1071
00:54:57,774 --> 00:55:02,143
Calm down, calm down.

1072
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,437
(sobbing)

1073
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:05,881
It's always a battle,Joshua.

1074
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,544
Just hold tight to your sword.

1075
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:12,679
BRAD:
Mom, I'm just saying he's young.

1076
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:16,183
He doesn't know, he doesn't know
what he wants yet, okay?

1077
00:55:16,193 --> 00:55:18,218
And he's reading the...
the Bible!

1078
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:20,228
And my-my-my wife,

1079
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,489
just as things are
starting to get good...

1080
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:24,224
now I've got to medicate her...

1081
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:26,760
because... because
you crossed the line.

1082
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,228
Now is not the time, Mom.

1083
00:55:28,238 --> 00:55:29,496
I-I need you here.

1084
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:30,731
Wait a second.
Wait a sec.

1085
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:32,733
Wait one second, little man.

1086
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:35,268
Now I want you to listen.

1087
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:38,538
I have been quiet and nice
the last few weeks.

1088
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:41,346
But now I have something to say.

1089
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:44,249
This is no place for a family.

1090
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:46,354
This is not a home.

1091
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:47,848
This is my home.

1092
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,449
No, this is a house.

1093
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:52,758
It's an apartment.

1094
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:55,022
(sniffling):
It's not a home.

1095
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:56,223
Okay.

1096
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:59,693
All this shouting
and this rage and anger,

1097
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:02,095
you know, that infects
a soul, Bradley.

1098
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:04,403
You know that.

1099
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:06,840
Regardless of God.

1100
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:08,368
Okay, okay, okay.

1101
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:10,037
So stop acting
like a boy,

1102
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,905
and start acting like a man.

1103
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:16,318
And take care of your family!

1104
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,416
You leave New York.

1105
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:19,946
You come home.

1106
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:23,915
You've been playing
city long enough.

1107
00:56:24,027 --> 00:56:27,588
It's time to grow up, Bradley.

1108
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:30,724
Once and for all.

1109
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,834
(footsteps approaching)

1110
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,298
(sighs)

1111
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,606
So, you love Jesus, huh?

1112
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:45,045
Go to bed.

1113
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:48,700
(indistinct crowd chatter,
birds chirping)

1114
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,900
(distant chatter
of children)

1115
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:59,453
(children screaming
and chattering)

1116
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:01,555
MAN:
Can you help me out, little man?

1117
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:04,193
Just something.

1118
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:07,600
Anything.

1119
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:09,704
I'm no chooser here.

1120
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,799
(children shouting)

1121
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:20,320
I'll give you five dollars
if I can throw a rock at you.

1122
00:57:22,753 --> 00:57:24,044
(door opening)

1123
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:25,245
NED:
Knock, knock.

1124
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:26,480
(gasps)

1125
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,924
Hello, hello, hello!

1126
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:30,183
(laughs)

1127
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:31,585
Hazel, are
you ready

1128
00:57:31,595 --> 00:57:33,687
for your big night out on the town?

1129
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:35,021
(laughs)

1130
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:37,023
Dinner at Joe Allen's
followed

1131
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:39,194
by the magic of...

1132
00:57:39,302 --> 00:57:40,927
<i>The Lion King.</i>

1133
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:42,662
(laughing):
Oh, Ned.

1134
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:44,833
I can't wait. Uh...

1135
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:48,968
Let me just, uh,
quickly fix my face.

1136
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:54,641
(horn honks)

1137
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:56,543
BRAD:
<i>Honey, I can't...</i>

1138
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:59,522
I can't get home right now, okay?

1139
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,948
I'm expecting a thing of beauty.

1140
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:04,654
Sleep tight.

1141
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:07,020
Hi. You know I...
You know I told you

1142
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,822
I need to nail this tomorrow, right?

1143
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:11,391
You know, I told you this
a million times, right?

1144
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:13,693
Joshua's fine, everyone's fine.

1145
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:16,062
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me, listen, listen.

1146
00:58:16,072 --> 00:58:17,330
Shh, shh, shh, listen, listen.

1147
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,666
Just be the wonderful mother
that you are, okay?

1148
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:21,535
And everything's going
to be just fine.

1149
00:58:21,545 --> 00:58:23,470
- I got to go, okay?
- (baby crying through phone)

1150
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,220
Just... I got to go,
I got to go. I love you.

1151
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:28,842
Hey.

1152
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:31,582
(inhales and exhales deeply)

1153
00:58:31,688 --> 00:58:33,747
(sniffles)

1154
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,552
- (gasps)
- Mommy?

1155
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:40,928
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1156
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:50,678
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1157
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:56,036
(door squeaking)

1158
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:07,280
(heavy sigh)

1159
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,049
Ah, she finally fell asleep.

1160
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,118
(laughs)

1161
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,759
(shallow breathing)

1162
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:18,300
Are you okay, Mommy?

1163
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,401
Yeah, yeah.

1164
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:21,995
I just...
(sniffles)

1165
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:23,430
Mommy's just being silly.

1166
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,731
(laughs)

1167
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:26,099
You know, hormones.

1168
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:27,267
What moans?

1169
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:28,869
(laughs)

1170
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:30,604
N-Never mind.

1171
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:32,654
(inhales shallow breath)

1172
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:34,107
So...

1173
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:37,245
Are we safe, Mommy?

1174
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:39,914
Well, what do you mean?

1175
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:42,514
Does Daddy love me?

1176
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:45,060
Of course he loves you.

1177
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:47,320
Yes, he loves you very, very much.

1178
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,326
Yeah.

1179
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,332
But not like a mommy.

1180
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,033
(sighs heavily)

1181
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:11,311
Can we play together?

1182
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:12,779
(sniffles
loudly)

1183
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:15,248
Yeah. Yeah, let's play a game, huh?

1184
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:17,417
What do you want to
play, backgammon?

1185
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:18,885
Hide-and-seek.

1186
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:20,520
Hide-and-seek?

1187
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,658
Oh. Well, I...

1188
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:25,894
Okay, fine.

1189
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:27,928
Good. I'll hide, you seek.

1190
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:29,896
Yeah, I figured as much.

1191
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:32,766
You close your eyes and count to 50.

1192
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:34,067
Okay.

1193
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:35,769
And Mommy?

1194
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:37,779
Yeah?

1195
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:40,146
No peeking.

1196
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,808
Okay.

1197
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:42,976
(sniffles loudly)

1198
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:44,144

four, five,

1201
01:00:49,092 --> 01:00:51,458
six, seven,

1202
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:54,428
eight, nine, ten,

Ready or not, here I come.

1211
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:33,962
I'm going to get you.

1212
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:38,906
Are you here?

1213
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:47,348
Where are you?

Where are you?!

1216
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:07,000
Huh?

1217
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:14,475
Where are you?

(door creaking)

1222
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:10,009
You know how to get a-a
Polish guy out of a tree?

1223
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:12,092
(laughs)

1224
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:14,027
A one-armed Polish
guy out of a tree.

1225
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:15,328
I-I already messed it up.

1226

1227
01:03:16,539 --> 01:03:18,264

You wave to him.

That's a...
little ditty I...

1231
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,873
What?

1232
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:28,675
Joshua!

It's okay.

It's okay.

Everything's fine.

1270
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:39,077
You're going to be okay, sweetie.

You're okay.

1274
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:51,481
You're my angel.

1275
01:06:51,491 --> 01:06:54,581
You're my little angel.

1276
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:57,819
Hey, kiddo, you okay?

1277
01:06:57,927 --> 01:07:00,157
- (moans)
- Shh!

1278
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:02,188
It's okay, sweetie.

1279
01:07:02,198 --> 01:07:04,198
It's okay.

1280
01:07:05,368 --> 01:07:06,592
It's okay.

1281
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:08,602
Did you get hurt?

1282
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,204
Are you hurt?

1283
01:07:14,214 --> 01:07:16,678
Lily's fine.
See, look.

1284
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,137
She's asleep in her crib.

1285
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:20,581
She's fine. See?

1286
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:23,447
- Okay?
- You!

1287
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:24,711
Sweetie, sweetie.

1288
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:26,379
You!

1289
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:28,614
Did you even look for me, Mommy?

1290
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:30,624
(Abby screams)

1291
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:36,364
- You!
- Abby! Abby! Abby!

1292
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:38,466
- (Abby screams)
- Abby!

1293
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:43,491
- (crying and screaming)
- Abby, come here.

1294
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:52,310
BRAD:
Ah! You scratched me!

1295
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:14,201
(plays notes)

1296
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:28,107
NED:
Sorry I-- (clears throat)

1297
01:08:28,117 --> 01:08:30,777
I didn't go inside.
It's the smell.

1298
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:33,379
- BRAD: Yeah.
- You know, it brings up...

1299
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:35,482
unpleasant memories.

1300
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:38,219
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

1301
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:40,327
(lighter clicks)

1302
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:42,822
How is she?

1303
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:45,191
She's pretty heavily medicated.

1304
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:47,201
- Good.
- (chuckles)

1305
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,598
The doctor said she hasn't
been taking her medication,

1306
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:55,805
but I... I-I-I made sure every day.

1307
01:08:55,912 --> 01:08:58,037
- I mean, I thought I was on top of that.
- Yeah.

1308
01:08:58,047 --> 01:08:59,939
- You know?
- We Davidoffs are crafty.

1309
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:03,407
She's probably cheeking the dose.

1310
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,344
Why, why? Why would she do that?

1311
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,652
It's the eternal question.

1312
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,021
I've been playing
spot the loony,

1313
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:17,031
but it's hard to tell.

1314
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:21,535
She was really...

1315
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,366
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

1316
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:30,402
Oh, what are you sorry about?

1317
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:32,138
I feel like I let her down, dude.

1318
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:35,141
Oh, come on, man.
This runs in the family.

1319
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:38,211
She'll get better, she will.

1320
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,812
It's--you've got to be optimistic.

1321
01:09:39,822 --> 01:09:43,477
They've made great
strides in psychotropics.

1322
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:49,497
(groans)

1323
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:55,328
You sure you want to do this?

1324
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:58,831
Oh, Chester, I don't
think I have a choice.

1325
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:00,933
You know, a lot of people
find comfort in work

1326
01:10:00,943 --> 01:10:02,668
when things are tough at home.

1327
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:04,737
You give up on work,

1328
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:06,739
you might find yourself
with nothing, chief.

1329
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:08,674
I'm just taking a vacation.

1330
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,843
Is that what you're calling it?

1331
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:13,117
Yeah, two weeks vacation.

1332
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:14,680
I've got personal days, too.

1333
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,682
This is not the time for a vacation.

1334
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:18,351
- I'll be checking in.
- Buddy.

1335
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:20,286
Wait, are you my friend?

1336
01:10:20,296 --> 01:10:21,521
Are we really buddies?

1337
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,623
Because if we are,
then you'll understand.

1338
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:25,191
If we're not, that's fine.

1339
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:26,692
But you're gonna have to fire me.

1340
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:28,427
- Whoa, there.
- Hey, hey.

1341
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:30,329
I can't-- Do you love your kids?

1342
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:32,335
Yeah, of course.

1343
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:33,966
I-I have to be home right now.

1344
01:10:33,976 --> 01:10:38,413
Okay? Cover for me or don't.

1345
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:03,029
Hello?

1346
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:05,937
Mom? Joshua?

1347
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:09,076
Anybody here?

1348
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:47,010
What're you looking at?

1349
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:49,448
Seth.

1350
01:11:49,552 --> 01:11:50,943
He's the god of chaos.

1351
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:53,183
Seth?

1352
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:55,281
That's the name of the god of chaos?

1353
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,759
Pity those heathens.

1354
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:02,192
<i>Seth cut Osirus into 1 4 pieces.</i>

1355
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,090
Bad Seth.

1356
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,694
But Seth is also good.

1357
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:08,861
Without Seth, there is no order

1358
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,162
because Seth is the only one

1359
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:12,365
who can battle
the evil serpent, Apep.

1360
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:15,276
- Huh.
- Apep is all bad.

1361
01:12:15,378 --> 01:12:16,869
Pure darkness.

1362
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:18,919
He eats his own screams.

1363
01:12:18,981 --> 01:12:21,541
That's his only nourishment.

1364
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:23,647
Enough of this myth.

1365
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:27,384
If Apep swallowed you,
you become nothing.

1366
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,148
A nonbeing.

1367
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:32,251
Till the end of existence,
you'd remain in Apep's guts,

1368
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:35,187
slowly digested for all of eternity.

1369
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:37,089
And nobody would care
'cause nobody would

1370
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:39,224
realize you were missing.

1371
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:45,128
And then came Moses
to stop all this nonsense.

1372
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,475
(piano playing)

1373
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:09,622
HAZEL:
Practice carrying...

1374
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:12,777
You'll grow into it, honey,
we all do.

1375
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:21,041
(chuckles)

1376
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:56,744
(footsteps)

1377
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:20,793
(crying)

1378
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:40,146
BRAD:
Nothing. She just started crying.

1379
01:14:40,156 --> 01:14:41,447
ABBY:
What did you do?

1380
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,667
BRAD:
I didn't do anything.

1381
01:14:52,468 --> 01:14:53,626
Hi.

1382
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:55,261
How you doing?

1383
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,296
Going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

1384
01:14:57,306 --> 01:14:59,306
Let's go, let's go.

1385
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:16,482
You know what, sweetie,

1386
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:19,251
I really need to use
this little girls' room

1387
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:21,620
right here for a sec, all right?

1388
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:24,605
You stay right here with the, uh...

1389
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:47,816
Uh...

1390
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:54,887
(man yelling)

1391
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:57,491
What the fuck...

1392
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,034
(two men yelling)

1393
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:28,562
HAZEL:
Joshua!

1394
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:32,432
Joshua!

1395
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:45,012
Joshua!

1396
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:47,306
(Lily crying)

1397
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:50,309
What were you doing?!

1398
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,344
- Where were you?
- Where were you?!

1399
01:16:52,354 --> 01:16:54,354
(Lily crying)

1400
01:16:57,459 --> 01:17:00,121
(crying)

1401
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:01,687
Brad.

1402
01:17:01,697 --> 01:17:03,697
(mumbles)

1403
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:06,029
(crying continues)

1404
01:17:06,135 --> 01:17:08,861
(crying):
So sorry. My God, Bradley.

1405
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:10,062
Jesus Christ, Mom.

1406
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:13,303
(crying):
I'm so sorry.

1407
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:15,334
Bradley.

1408
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:17,403
I'm sorry.

1409
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,708
I'm so sorry.

1410
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:21,507
(sniffles)

1411
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,517
(mumbles)

1412
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:27,046
(cries)

1413
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:29,148
You gave me such a fright.

1414
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:31,820
(crying)

1415
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:33,927
Shh, shh, shh.

1416
01:17:33,963 --> 01:17:36,221
HAZEL:
Don't! No! No! Oh! You...

1417
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,231
(thudding, woman gasps)

1418
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:47,341
Nana!

1419
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:53,271
No!

1420
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:55,407
WOMAN:
Does somebody have a cell phone?

1421
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:56,675
I don't know...

1422
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:57,910
(Joshua whimpering)

1423
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,718
(crowd chatter)

1424
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,015
I'm just so sorry about your mother.

1425
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:04,883
I... those stairs.

1426
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:06,919
They were just
an accident waiting to happen.

1427
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:10,729
Yeah. I don't know
what happened, you know?

1428
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:14,234
She was up there

1429
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:16,336
with Josh...

1430
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:20,474
Yeah.

1431
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:26,781
You know, they say she slipped.

1432
01:18:29,351 --> 01:18:30,809
No doubt about it.

1433
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:33,624
You have had one fucked-up month.

1434
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:36,021
I think he pushed her.

1435
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:37,316
Who?

1436
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:39,326
Joshua.

1437
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:43,929
Come on. That's...

1438
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:49,335
Come on. You're...

1439
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:53,272
You're talking
about a nine-year-old boy.

1440
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,567
I think all of this
has been his doing.

1441
01:18:55,577 --> 01:18:57,703
Do you hear me?
I think Abby...

1442
01:18:57,713 --> 01:19:00,706
I think the screaming--
Lily's screaming...

1443
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:02,941
There must be something we can do.

1444
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,309
You don't understand.
I'm trying...

1445
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:09,723
Maybe you should think
about talking to someone.

1446
01:19:09,825 --> 01:19:11,517
What are you talking about?

1447
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:13,419
You mean like a shrink or something?

1448
01:19:13,429 --> 01:19:14,787
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1449
01:19:14,797 --> 01:19:17,095
I know if you...

1450
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,792
This isn't about me.
I'm talking about...

1451
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:22,202
Ah!Joshua, my boy.

1452
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:30,300
(whispering)

1453
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,925
Lily's sleeping with me from now on.

1454
01:19:52,935 --> 01:19:55,495
Daddy?

1455
01:19:55,604 --> 01:19:57,229
Yes?

1456
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:59,198
I'm scared.

1457
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,904
Yeah? Well...

1458
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:05,912
Daddy?

1459
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:07,873
Yeah?

1460
01:20:07,883 --> 01:20:09,475
I don't understand.

1461
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:11,485
Go to bed.

1462
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:18,748
(footsteps)

1463
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,362
(footsteps)

1464
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:47,478
Daddy?

1465
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:49,448
Do you like my house?

1466
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,458
I made it last night.

1467
01:21:04,173 --> 01:21:06,632
I know what you're doing,Josh.

1468
01:21:06,642 --> 01:21:10,977
<i>I don't know why you're</i>
doing it, but I'm on to you.

1469
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,147
They're just blocks, Daddy.

1470
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:18,583
You're not going
to hurt anybody else.

1471
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,880
Are you mad at me?

1472
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:26,020
Do you still love me, Daddy?

1473
01:21:29,965 --> 01:21:32,126
I think you're sick,Josh.

1474
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:40,871
I don't feel sick.

1475
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:42,976
Not at all.

1476
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:50,409
Why are you doing this?

1477
01:21:50,519 --> 01:21:53,147
Huh?

1478
01:21:58,393 --> 01:22:01,538
You know what
the best part is, Daddy?

1479
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:16,534
(Lily crying)

1480
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:23,050
(crying continues)

1481
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:29,318
(crying continues)

1482
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:35,928
(crying continues)

1483
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:42,364
(crying continues)

1484
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:47,406
(crying continues)

1485
01:23:16,305 --> 01:23:19,570
(ice in glass rattling)

1486
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:38,284
(ice rattling)

1487
01:23:40,095 --> 01:23:43,861
(ice rattling)

1488
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:46,024
(doorbell rings)

1489
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,145
Hi. How are you?

1490
01:24:07,155 --> 01:24:08,780
Good to see you.

1491
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:10,349
Really good to see you.

1492
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,504
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

1493
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:34,882
Hey, buddy, this is Dr. Polsheck.

1494
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:36,742
She's here to talk to you.

1495
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:38,176
Oh, no. Betsy, please.

1496
01:24:38,186 --> 01:24:40,950
Hello,Joshua.

1497
01:24:41,056 --> 01:24:44,184
Betsy's a child psychologist.

1498
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,318
She's going to talk to you.

1499
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:49,354
Yeah. Maybe you could
show me your room. I hear

1500
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:52,023
you have a guinea pig.
I love guinea pigs.

1501
01:24:52,033 --> 01:24:54,627
My guinea pig?

1502
01:24:54,736 --> 01:24:58,228
Okay.

1503
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,265
Great.

1504
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:02,800
Have fun, buddy.

1505
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:04,703
Do you like to draw?

1506
01:25:04,713 --> 01:25:06,713
Oh, I love drawing.

1507
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:33,606
Keep drawing.
That's good.

1508
01:25:44,252 --> 01:25:46,292
That's really something.

1509
01:25:54,095 --> 01:25:58,054
Joshua, come here for a second.

1510
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:00,125
Why don't you do me a favor,

1511
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:02,627
and go in your bedroom? All right?

1512
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:04,637
Just for a second?

1513
01:26:08,777 --> 01:26:12,037
Listen, I should be alone
with the boy, okay?

1514
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:14,277
Yeah. Sure.

1515
01:26:14,382 --> 01:26:16,873
Do you see...? This...

1516
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:19,110
this is off.
Something is wrong here.

1517
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,046
This has got to be the sign
of some kind of...

1518
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:22,981
- You got that right.
- Sociopath?

1519
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:25,221
No, no, no, Mr. Cairn.

1520
01:26:25,327 --> 01:26:26,685
That's...
that's not it.

1521
01:26:26,695 --> 01:26:28,993
What is this?

1522
01:26:29,097 --> 01:26:32,794
This picture is
a textbook example of abuse.

1523
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,427
Okay? That boy is being abused...

1524
01:26:35,437 --> 01:26:36,962
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1525
01:26:36,972 --> 01:26:38,864
to such a degree that I can't...

1526
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:40,232
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1527
01:26:40,242 --> 01:26:42,100
Let me tell you what
you're dealing with here.

1528
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,134
- I don't care...
- He probably...

1529
01:26:43,144 --> 01:26:44,503
He probably researched it.

1530
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:46,137
He probably looked it up
on the computer.

1531
01:26:46,147 --> 01:26:47,606
He probably knew exactly
what to draw.

1532
01:26:47,616 --> 01:26:49,841
This is abuse
I'm talking about right here.

1533
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:51,409
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1534
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:54,279
What are you...?
Nobody's beating him.

1535
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:55,614
I'm not... He probably...

1536
01:26:55,624 --> 01:26:56,948
Why are you being so defensive?

1537
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:58,783
- I'm not being...
- I'm just pointing out the fact

1538
01:26:58,793 --> 01:27:01,186
- that your son has been abused.
- Listen, you have to...

1539
01:27:01,196 --> 01:27:03,391
Back off!. Okay?

1540
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:21,673
Talked to your headmaster.

1541
01:27:21,683 --> 01:27:22,941
- You did?
- Yeah.

1542
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,943
We agreed you're not
being challenged enough,

1543
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:28,480
so we're going to send you
somewhere else far away.

1544
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,348
You're going to learn how to ski.

1545
01:27:30,358 --> 01:27:33,122
It's going to be great.

1546
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:34,252
But how could...?

1547
01:27:34,262 --> 01:27:35,720
End of discussion, little man.

1548
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:37,755
No buts, okay?

1549
01:27:37,866 --> 01:27:39,224
You're going away.

1550
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:40,692
You understand?

1551
01:27:40,702 --> 01:27:42,093
Hey.

1552
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:44,103
Josh...Joshua!

1553
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:49,034
What?

1554
01:27:49,044 --> 01:27:51,084
What are you looking at?

1555
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:07,226
Josh?

1556
01:28:08,897 --> 01:28:13,317
Josh, I want you to come here
right now, you hear me?

1557
01:28:14,402 --> 01:28:16,294
Josh.

1558
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:18,363
Hey, boy.

1559
01:28:21,676 --> 01:28:24,406
It's me. I want to talk to you.

1560
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:27,147
We're going to talk about this.

1561
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:31,818
Josh?

1562
01:28:33,388 --> 01:28:35,388
Joshua?

1563
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:38,091
Josh!

1564
01:28:38,126 --> 01:28:40,752
Everything's okay, buddy.
Come on out.

1565
01:28:40,762 --> 01:28:42,354
I know you're here.

1566
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:45,424
Listen, nothing's
set in stone, okay?

1567
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:49,861
(to himself):
All right, suit yourself.

1568
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:51,329
Josh?

1569
01:28:51,339 --> 01:28:53,339
Josh!

1570
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:31,568
(distant whining)

1571
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:39,584
(whining grows louder)

1572
01:29:43,024 --> 01:29:45,584
(whining continues)

1573
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:50,963
(Lily coos)

1574
01:30:08,683 --> 01:30:11,516
(whimpering)

1575
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:18,491
(crying)

1576
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:31,137
(crying continues)

1577
01:30:36,244 --> 01:30:37,469
(crying grows louder)

1578
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:39,504
(whispers):
Joshua.

1579
01:30:40,582 --> 01:30:42,407
Joshua.
What are you doing?

1580
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:43,708
Come out from under there.

1581
01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:45,176
I don't want to go.

1582
01:30:45,186 --> 01:30:46,277
Joshua, come on.

1583
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:47,412
Come out from under there.

1584
01:30:47,422 --> 01:30:48,580
(sniffles)

1585
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:50,782
- I want to stay here
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1586
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:53,485
- with you and Lily...
- Shh, shh, shh.

1587
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:56,788
- and Mom when she gets better.
- Shh, shh.

1588
01:30:56,798 --> 01:30:58,022
- Come here.
- I want to stay.

1589
01:30:58,032 --> 01:30:59,424
- Come on.
- Ow!

1590
01:30:59,434 --> 01:31:01,434
Ow!

1591
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,762
- Come here.
- (groans)

1592
01:31:03,772 --> 01:31:05,768
What's going on?

1593
01:31:05,778 --> 01:31:07,332
Ah, oh.

1594
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:09,801
My God,Joshua,
what happened to you?

1595
01:31:09,811 --> 01:31:11,436
- What happened?
- I slipped.

1596
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:12,504
You what?

1597
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:14,372
I slipped.

1598
01:31:14,382 --> 01:31:16,508
- I-I...
-Joshua, please tell me what happened.

1599
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,243
- I slipped, really.
- Who did this to you?

1600
01:31:18,253 --> 01:31:20,078
- I slipped, really.
- Who did this to you?!

1601
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:23,114
- I slipped.
- You tell me who did it to you.

1602
01:31:23,124 --> 01:31:27,151
Look, it's just there, okay?
That's all.

1603
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:29,560
It doesn't hurt much.

1604
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,599
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1605
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,827
(cries)

1606
01:31:34,936 --> 01:31:38,081
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, okay?

1607
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:55,013
- Stay, stay with me.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1608
01:31:55,023 --> 01:31:57,019
- Stay.
-Josh.

1609
01:31:57,029 --> 01:31:58,716
- I got to go check...
- Stay.

1610
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:00,151
I got to check on Lily.

1611
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:02,153
- Stay with me.
- I got to go.

1612
01:32:02,163 --> 01:32:03,655
Stay like you used to.

1613
01:32:03,665 --> 01:32:05,323
You're gonna...

1614
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:08,200
Stay with me like you used to.

1615
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:14,599
Okay, okay, okay, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1616
01:32:14,609 --> 01:32:17,499
Just go to sleep.
Just go to sleep.

1617
01:32:20,248 --> 01:32:22,288
Just go to sleep, buddy.

1618
01:32:24,686 --> 01:32:27,018
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1619
01:32:52,313 --> 01:32:54,313
(gasps)

1620
01:32:56,384 --> 01:32:58,511
Josh? Josh.

1621
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:08,762
Shh. She's almost done.

1622
01:33:10,164 --> 01:33:13,649
You were hungry this
morning, weren't you?

1623
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:18,463
It's a beautiful day.

1624
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:22,213
After this, how about
we go outside and play?

1625
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:35,304
(children shouting playfully
in distance)

1626
01:33:48,436 --> 01:33:50,436
Joshua...

1627
01:33:52,473 --> 01:33:55,135
Beware of the Jabberwock.

1628
01:33:55,243 --> 01:33:57,973
What?

1629
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:00,775
(cries)

1630
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:02,840
Shh...

1631
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:05,148
shh, shh, shh, shh.

1632
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:08,222
(crying continues)

1633
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:11,916
Did he just...

1634
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:14,218
just take your fuckin' binky?!

1635
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:17,061
(crying continues)

1636
01:34:17,165 --> 01:34:18,489
Joshua.

1637
01:34:18,499 --> 01:34:19,891
Joshua.

1638
01:34:19,901 --> 01:34:21,726
Joshua!

1639
01:34:21,736 --> 01:34:23,494
Where's Lily's binky?

1640
01:34:23,504 --> 01:34:25,296
- (Lily crying)
-Joshua!

1641
01:34:25,306 --> 01:34:27,065
(crying continues)

1642
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,339
Joshua, come down.

1643
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:33,071
Josh.

1644
01:34:33,081 --> 01:34:34,172
Josh.

1645
01:34:34,182 --> 01:34:37,879
(Lily crying)

1646
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,813
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1647
01:34:41,823 --> 01:34:43,448
It's okay, it's okay.

1648
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:45,216
(crying continues)

1649
01:34:45,226 --> 01:34:46,317
Come on.

1650
01:34:46,327 --> 01:34:47,352
Let's go.

1651
01:34:47,362 --> 01:34:48,753
Come on, let's go.

1652
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:51,155
I'm talking to you.
You better come down here right now.

1653
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:53,157
- You better come down here right now.
-Joshua.

1654
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:55,397
(Lily crying)

1655
01:34:55,503 --> 01:34:57,503
-Joshua.
-Joshua.

1656
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:02,700
-Joshua...
-Joshua.

1657
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:04,569
I'm not fucking around
with you right now,

1658
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:06,579
you understand me?

1659
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:10,842
Come down right now.

1660
01:35:10,852 --> 01:35:12,043
Come down right now.

1661
01:35:12,053 --> 01:35:14,053
Goddamn it!

1662
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:16,547
- WOMAN: Bobby, get down from...
- Where is it?

1663
01:35:16,557 --> 01:35:17,915
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1664
01:35:17,925 --> 01:35:19,350
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1665
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,418
Where's Lily's binky?

1666
01:35:20,428 --> 01:35:21,452
Where's Lily's binky?

1667
01:35:21,462 --> 01:35:22,687
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1668
01:35:22,697 --> 01:35:23,888
You answer me.

1669
01:35:23,898 --> 01:35:25,523
- You answer your father.
- You answer your father.

1670
01:35:25,533 --> 01:35:26,624
Answer your father!

1671
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:28,634
No, no, no, Daddy!

1672
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:30,828
(woman gasps in distance)

1673
01:35:30,838 --> 01:35:33,739
(onlookers murmuring)

1674
01:35:33,841 --> 01:35:35,633
Josh.

1675
01:35:35,643 --> 01:35:37,941
I'm sorry.

1676
01:35:43,117 --> 01:35:45,847
Nobody will ever love you.

1677
01:35:53,661 --> 01:35:56,129
(stifled moans)

1678
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:03,202
(ominous music plays)

1679
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:44,210
(door opens)

1680
01:36:44,245 --> 01:36:47,703
Oh, Chester, thank God.

1681
01:36:47,815 --> 01:36:49,340
- Hey, buddy.
- Sit down, sit down.

1682
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,374
What's going on here?

1683
01:36:50,384 --> 01:36:52,009
When am I getting bail?

1684
01:36:52,019 --> 01:36:53,544
Not till Monday.

1685
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:54,812
Don't you know?

1686
01:36:54,822 --> 01:36:56,981
Never beat up your kid
in public on the weekend.

1687
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:58,549
Chester, um, I-I appreciate
you coming.

1688
01:36:58,559 --> 01:37:00,017
- All right.
- I've had a long...

1689
01:37:00,027 --> 01:37:02,894
Whatever!
Whatever! I'm here!

1690
01:37:02,997 --> 01:37:05,292
You see the judge tomorrow.

1691
01:37:07,802 --> 01:37:10,862
I've been doing
a little snooping via a friend.

1692
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:12,130
This is bad.

1693
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:13,131
This is really bad.

1694
01:37:13,141 --> 01:37:14,365
Yeah, I know it's bad, okay?

1695
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:15,566
It isn't the whole story, Chester.

1696
01:37:15,576 --> 01:37:16,567
We'll, let's see.

1697
01:37:16,577 --> 01:37:18,302
- It's not...
- Let's see.

1698
01:37:18,312 --> 01:37:20,371
Uh, over 30 eyewitnesses,

1699
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:22,573
your boy tells the cops
he's been being abused

1700
01:37:22,583 --> 01:37:24,375
since his sister was born,

1701
01:37:24,385 --> 01:37:26,010
bruises all over his body,

1702
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:28,012
a sheaf of Joshua's
drawings

1703
01:37:28,022 --> 01:37:29,480
that have the
authorities drooling...

1704
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:33,718
Chester, goddamn it,
it isn't the whole story, okay?

1705
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:35,052
- Look...
- I'm trying to tell...

1706
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:36,821
I have to get out of here now.

1707
01:37:36,831 --> 01:37:41,734
They say you were tampering
with Abby's medication.

1708
01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:46,205
What? That's-that's insane.

1709
01:37:46,307 --> 01:37:49,276
(piano playing gentle melody)

1710
01:37:54,415 --> 01:37:56,374
No, look,
I don't care

1711
01:37:56,384 --> 01:37:57,675
if she's from
the Philippines

1712
01:37:57,685 --> 01:37:59,110
or Philadelphia,
I just need

1713
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,860
someone who knows how
to take care of a baby.

1714
01:38:02,924 --> 01:38:05,082
Listen, if it looks like
it's for a kid,

1715
01:38:05,092 --> 01:38:07,084
pick it up and pack it,
okay? Thanks.

1716
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:08,953
(playing "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star")

1717
01:38:08,963 --> 01:38:12,023
Oh, for the love of God,
please, today.

1718
01:38:12,033 --> 01:38:15,127
Yes, yes.

1719
01:38:15,236 --> 01:38:16,928
Imelda sounds great.

1720
01:38:16,938 --> 01:38:18,229
Yes.

1721
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:22,744
Great, send her over.
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

1722
01:38:22,777 --> 01:38:24,235
Bye.

1723
01:38:24,245 --> 01:38:26,440
(sighs)

1724
01:38:26,547 --> 01:38:28,543
Hey...

1725
01:38:28,553 --> 01:38:30,007
Imelda...

1726
01:38:30,017 --> 01:38:33,509
sounds like she is one
fabulous cook,

1727
01:38:33,621 --> 01:38:38,058
which makes you one
very, very lucky girl.

1728
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,185
Want to suck on your hand instead?

1729
01:38:41,295 --> 01:38:46,735
Oh! Your sister's just about the
cutest thing in the whole world.

1730
01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:49,785
I love her more than anything.

1731
01:38:56,344 --> 01:39:00,075
You know, siblings
are very important

1732
01:39:00,181 --> 01:39:03,116
in strange times.

1733
01:39:03,217 --> 01:39:05,879
Speaking from experience.

1734
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:08,148
Like you and Mom?

1735
01:39:08,256 --> 01:39:10,952
Yeah.

1736
01:39:11,058 --> 01:39:12,049
(plays pretty melody)

1737
01:39:12,059 --> 01:39:13,751
- Ned?
- Mm-hmm?

1738
01:39:13,761 --> 01:39:16,525
I'm glad you're here.

1739
01:39:16,631 --> 01:39:18,522
I mean...

1740
01:39:18,532 --> 01:39:21,501
you, me, th...

1741
01:39:21,602 --> 01:39:24,064
this feels right, doesn't it?

1742
01:39:24,074 --> 01:39:26,030
The way it always should have been.

1743
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,338
(notes trailing off)

1744
01:39:30,378 --> 01:39:33,836
We should compose
something together.

1745
01:39:33,948 --> 01:39:35,506
(clears throat)

1746
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:37,108
(smacks lips)

1747
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:41,248
(plays plaintive chords)

1748
01:39:41,355 --> 01:39:47,453
# Nobody ever
called me "Daddy" #

1749
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:50,421
(a capella):
# Actually, that's not true. #

1750
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:52,490
Ugh!

1751
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:55,932
(playing soft arpeggios)

1752
01:40:01,842 --> 01:40:05,141
(plays sparse melody)

1753
01:40:05,246 --> 01:40:08,841
# You know they
didn't ever #

1754
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:13,352
# Have to love me #

1755
01:40:13,454 --> 01:40:17,584
# No, no, no #

1756
01:40:17,692 --> 01:40:23,653
# And no one will ever
love them now #

1757
01:40:28,903 --> 01:40:32,839
# But they always
wanted somehow #

1758
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:36,267
- # To save me #
- (footsteps approaching)

1759
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:40,077
# Why, oh, why? #

1760
01:40:40,181 --> 01:40:42,006
# For pity's sake #

1761
01:40:42,016 --> 01:40:46,385
# They should have
saved themselves #

1762
01:40:50,424 --> 01:40:57,853
# But you, you always said
I never missed a note #

1763
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:09,668
# And nobody ever knew me
like you do #

1764
01:41:15,349 --> 01:41:21,185
# You always said
it was gonna be okay #

1765
01:41:26,894 --> 01:41:33,060
# I only ever really
wanted to be with you. #

1766
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:35,167
(stops playing)

1767
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:52,076
(acoustic guitar strums
folk-rock rhythm)

1768
01:41:52,086 --> 01:41:54,554
(man singing)

1769
01:45:41,382 --> 01:45:43,382
(music fades)
