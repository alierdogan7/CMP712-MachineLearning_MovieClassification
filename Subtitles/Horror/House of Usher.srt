I should like to see Miss Usher.

3

Well, I'm afraid
that's not possible, sir.

4
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,346
Miss Usher
is confined to her bed.

5
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,560
She's ill?
Yes, sir.

6
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,681
Is it serious?
Sir?

7
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,024
My name is Philip Winthrop.

8
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,063
Miss Usher and I
are engaged to be married.

9
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,153
I cannot admit you, sir.

10
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,819
Cannot?
By whose order?

11
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,783
Mr Roderick, her brother.

12
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,653
He has expressly forbidden...
Then I shall speak to him.

13
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,870
I insist you announce me.

14
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,039
Yes, sir.
If you'll just come in.

15
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,423
Your coat, sir.

16
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,351
If you'll just follow me.

17
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,061
Yes? What is it?

18
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,984
Your boots, sir.

19
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,366
What about them?

20
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,362
Do you mind taking them off?

21
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,997
Taking them off?

22
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,749
What on earth for?

23
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,167
I'm sure Mr Roderick
will explain it to you, sir.

24
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,550
A strange request.

25
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,140
This is the first time
I've ever been...

26
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,592
Sir!

27
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,548
If you'd care to put
these on, sir.

28
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,719
Thank you.

29
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,604
Well, if we may go now.

30
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,365

31
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,401
What is the meaning of this?

32
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,358
I---

33
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,322
This is Mr Winthrop, sir.

34
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,033
How dare you
admit anyone into this house?

35
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,868
WINTHROP:
I insisted, sir.

36
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,579

37

Well, we can't talk out here.

38

Please come in.

39
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,548
I gather you know who I am, sir.
If you please...

40
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,551
Mr Winthrop, softly.

41
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,268
An affliction of the hearing.

42
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:33,235
Sounds of any exaggerated degree
cut into my brain like knives.

43
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,438
My apologies.

44
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,908
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave, Mr Winthrop.

45
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,448
I've come to see Madeline.

46
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,118
That is quite impossible.

47
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,370
She is confined to her bed.

48
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,459
Mr Usher, your sister
and I are betrothed.

49
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,881
It was a mistake.
I don't believe that.

50
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,130
Please don't argue with me, sir.

51
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,679
You must leave this house now.

52
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,559
It is not a healthy place
for you to be.

53
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,022
Mr Usher...

54
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:18,151
I have ridden all the way
from Boston to see Madeline,

55
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,694
and I do not intend to leave
without seeing her.

56
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,533
Now, if...
WOMAN: Philip!

57
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,989
Madeline.

58
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,209
Madeline, in heaven's name,
you must return to your bed.

59
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,663
Madeline.

60
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,837
You came all the way
just to see me?

61
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,756
Yes, to see you.

62
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,844
Madeline, I must insist.

63
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,883
We shall talk later, Philip.
Mr Winthrop is leaving.

64
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,428
Leaving?
I'm not leaving.

65
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,057
He must stay, Roderick.

66
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,185
Please let him stay, Roderick.

67
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,397
Very well, he will stay.

68
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,196
Now, for pity's sake,
return to your bed.

I think your fireplace
needs a screen.

72
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,444
Does it?

73
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,541
I was just admiring this painting here.
Is it your own work?

74
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,163
It is.
And you also play this lute?

75
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,174
I do.

76
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,880
Mr Winthrop, are you actually
planning to marry my sister?

77
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,807
Mr Usher,

78
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,062
during the time we spent together in
Boston, it never occurred to me that...

79
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,766
and I dare say to
Madeline either,

80
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,815
that we were not destined
for each other.

81
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,486
When she left me, she said to me,
"I will love you forever."

82
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,745
Does it seem so incredible, then,
that I would want to marry her?

83
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,330
If you only knew how incredible.

84
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,917
And I suppose this...

85
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,166
this vision includes children?

86
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,215
God willing.
God willing!

87
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,462
If you knew the nightmare
you are picturing for me, sir.

88
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,009
Nightmare?
That's what I said.

89
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,930
Why shouldn't Madeline marry
and have children?

90
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,598
Because the Usher line
is tainted, Mr Winthrop.

91
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,022
Tainted, sir?
You saw Madeline and you see me.

92
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,937
We are dying, Mr Winthrop.

93
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,483
As you saw her today,
she is and will remain.

94
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,331
Believe me, sir,
I bear you no malice.

95
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,371
Were things otherwise, I should
welcome you into our family joyously.

96
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,216
But under the circumstances
it is quite impossible.

97
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,712
But why do you assume that...
that you are dying?

98
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,890
There are many reasons.

99
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,134
Pray give me one, then.

100
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,062
Madeline and I
are like figures of fine glass.

101
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,732
The slightest touch
and we may shatter.

102
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,992
Both of us suffer from
a morbid acuteness of the senses.

103
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,654
Mine is the worse
for having existed the longer,

104
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,122
but both of us are
afflicted with it.

105
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,664
Any sort of food more exotic
than the most pallid mash

106
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,289
is unendurable to my taste buds.

107
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,965
Any sort of garment other than
the softest is agony to my flesh.

108
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:14,258
My eyes are tormented by
all but the faintest illumination.

109
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,019
Odours assail me constantly.

110
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,643
And, as I've said,
sounds of any degree whatsoever

111
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,518
inspire me with terror.

112
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,987
That's why your servant asked
me to remove my boots.

113
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,148
Yes.

114
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,867
And even so,
I could hear your coming.

115
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,204
Every footstep,
every rustle of your clothes.

116
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,915
I could hear your
horse approaching,

117
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,788
hear the clatter of its hooves
across the courtyard, your knock...

118
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,917
The grating of the door bolt
was like a sword stroke to my ears.

119
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,215
I can hear the scratch of rat
claws within the stone wall.

120
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:03,190
Mr Winthrop, three-quarters of
my family have fallen into madness,

121
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,903
and in their madness have
acquired a superhuman strength,

122
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,111
so that it took the power
of many to subdue them.

123
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,030

00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,161
Very well.

I suggest we retire too,

eat much usually.

358
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,094
It's the air itself.

359
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,764
Nothing can survive it long.

360
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,978
My great-grandfather.

361
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,701
His wife.

362
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,714
My grandfather.

363
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,686
My grandmother.

364
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,356
My father.

365
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,074
My mother.

366
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,599
This is monstrous!

367
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:01,061
Whose idea was this?
Your dear brother's?

368
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,350
There's one for him too.

369
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,599
Does that absolve him?

370
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,185
It waits for me.

371
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,608
No, it does not.

372
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,992
They all wait for me.

373
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,119
Oh, Madeline, Madeline,
you must stop this.

374
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,124
Can't you see
what you're doing to yourself?

375
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,712
You don't understand.

376
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,003
I understand, but you must
leave the dead to themselves.

377
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,876
Oh, Madeline,
come away with me now.

378
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,340
(SCREAMS)

379
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,768
What have you done?

380
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,941
Give her to me.

381
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,856
Thank you.
See to the crypt, will you?

382
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,945
Yes, sir.

383
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,084
Well, are you content now,
Mr Winthrop?

384
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,250
It is not I who force her
to live in a cemetery.

385
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,049
Do you think
that I wish her harm?

386
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,337
I think you still
do not understand.

387
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,635
And I think it's time
that you did.

388
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,348
The tarn is very deep.

389
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,271
One of the Usher women
drowned herself in it.

390
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,269
She was never found.

391
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,236
I dare say it's deep enough
to swallow this house entire.

392
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,950
I'm waiting, Mr Usher.

393
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,655
Last night you asked me
about the singular aridity

394
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,783
of the land around this house.

395
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,913
Once this land was fertile.

396
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:37,713
Farms abounded. Earth yielded
her riches at harvest time.

397
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:43,591
There were trees and plant life,
flowers, fields of grain.

398
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,388
There was great beauty here.

399
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,226
At that time this water
was clear and fresh.

400
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,976
Swans glided
upon its crystal surface.

401
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,731
Animals came to its bank,
trustingly, to drink.

402
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,735
But this was long before my time.

403
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,414
Why do you tell me these things?

404
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,128
And then something crept
across the land and blighted it.

405
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,794
The trees lost their foliage.

406
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,510
The flowers languished and died.

407
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,263
Shrubs grew brown and shrivelled.

408
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,097
The grain fields perished.

409
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:33,398
The lakes and ponds
became black and stagnant.

410
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,937
And the land withered
as before a plague.

411
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,981
A plague?

412
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,780
Yes, Mr Winthrop.

413
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,242
A plague of evil.

414
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,365
Anthony Usher.

415
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,834
Thief, usurer...

416
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,254
merchant of flesh.

417
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,797
Bernard Usher.

418
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,180
Swindler, forger,

419
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,096
jewel thief, drug addict.

420
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,764
Francis Usher.

421
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,983
Professional assassin.

422
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,406
Vivian Usher. Blackmailer...

423
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,152
harlot, murderess.

424
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,656
She died in the madhouse.

425
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,085
Captain David Usher.

426
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,795
Smuggler, slave-trader...

427
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,248
mass murderer.

428
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:47,256
Mr Usher, I don't see that this has
anything to do with Madeline and myself.

429
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,851
I don't believe in the sins of the
fathers being visited upon the children.

430
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,099
You do not, sir?

431
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,403
The House of Usher
seems to you, then, normal?

432
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,367
The house, sir, is neither
normal nor abnormal.

433
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,485
It is only a house.

434
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,159
You are very wrong,
Mr Winthrop.

435
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,250
This house is centuries old.
It was brought here from England.

436
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,745
And with it
every evil rooted in its stones.

437
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,588
You really believe this!

438
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,549
Evil is not just a word,
it is a reality.

439
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:33,101
Like any living thing, it can be created.
It was created by these people.

440
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:42,102
The history of the Ushers is a
history of savage degradations.

441
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,900
First in England,
and then in New England.

442
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,650
And always in this house.

443
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,661
Always in this house.

444
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,661
The pall of evil
which fills it is no illusion.

445
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,876
For hundreds of years,

446
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,713
foul thoughts and foul deeds have
been committed within its walls.

447
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,174
The house itself is evil now.

448
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,218
No, I... I cannot believe this.
But you must.

449
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,343
For Madeline's sake,
you must.

450
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,311
Most of all
does this evil reside in her.

451
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,940
And this is your
dreadful secret?

452
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,601
Mr Winthrop,

453
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,031
do you think those coals jumping from
the fire onto you were an accident?

454
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,869
Do you think that chandelier
falling was an accident?

455
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,363
Do you think that falling
casket was an accident?

456
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:38,287
Are you trying to tell me that the
house made those things happen?

457
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,784
Yes.

458
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,167
Oh, no, sir.
That's ridiculous.

459
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,465
But even if it were true...

460
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:51,053
even if this house were
full of evil, Madeline is not.

461
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,094
Nor, for all of your talk,
are you.

462
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:58,220
You cannot take my sister
out of this house.

463
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,267
If she were to wed and
bear children,

464
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,517
the Usher evil would spread anew -
malignant, cancerous.

465
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,985
You are mad. I will not listen to you.
Yes, you will.

466
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,275
No, I will not!

467
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,570
I'll tell you what's evil
in this house, sir. You!

468
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,116
I will not let your sickened
fancies destroy Madeline's life!

469
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,743
She leaves with me today.

470
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,384
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

471
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,337
Who is it?

472
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,342
We're leaving... now.

473
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,760
Philip...
Madeline, you have no other choice.

474
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,015
If you remain here,
this house will destroy you.

475
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,897
Then you know.

476
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,067
Your brother has poisoned you
with his absurdities.

477
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:54,944
This entire atmosphere of sickness
and disillusion is his doing.

478
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:02,284
Madeline, there's nothing wrong with you
that leaving this house won't cure.

479
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,377
Do you love me?

480
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,925
You know I do.
Then leave with me now.

481
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,966
I Will.

482
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,519
Pack just a few belongings.
I'll get my things ready.

483
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,268
How will we go?
You'll ride with me.

484
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,110
Later on we'll get a
coach to Boston.

485
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,736
Oh, Philip, can it truly be?

486
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,076
Darling, within an hour
we'll be away from here.

487
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,072
I love you.

488
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,121
I love you.

489
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,078
Pack, quickly.

490
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,231
MADELINE: No, Roderick.
No, I will not listen.

491
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,976
I've been here long enough.
Please let me go.

492
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,105
I don't care what you say!
You can't keep me here!

493
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,276
You have no right.
RODERICK: I say you can't go.

494
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,903
MADELINE: No, I will not listen.
Please let me go.

495
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,530
There may be no hope for you,
but there is for me.

496
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,124
I say I will!
Madeline.

497
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,086
I must leave, Roderick. Please let me.
Madeline!

498
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,297
I don't care what you say.

499
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,291
There's nothing you can say,
Roderick. I will leave!

500
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,589
Madeline, open the door.
(SHE SCREAMS)

501
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,337
Madeline!

502
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,973
What have you done to her?

503
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,114
Madeline?

504
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,617
Madeline.

505
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,573
Madeline.

506
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,588
No.

507
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,385
No.

508
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,935
Madeline?

509
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,687
Madeline?

510
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,946
No.

511
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,494
Yes, she's dead.

512
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:48,075
I told you she could
never leave this house.

513
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,248
What did you do to her?
I didn't touch her.

514
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,246
You killed her!

515
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,465
There is no mark on her.

516
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,835
You are the one who killed her.

517
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,131
I...
I told you she was not well,

518
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,508
and yet you persisted.

519
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,933
Her heart could not withstand
the strain you put upon it.

520
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,017
No.

521
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,727
It's no matter now.

522
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:21,032
At least she has been spared
the agony of trying to escape.

523
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:42,420
One candle left to burn now...

524
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,270
before the darkness comes.

525
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:23,929
At least...
she has found peace now.

526
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,597
Has she?

527
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,305
Why do you say that?

528
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:36,149
Because I do not believe that for
the Ushers there is peace hereafter.

529
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,314
Is there no end to your horrors?

530
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,109
No.

531
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,527
None whatever.

532
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,571
For they are not mine alone.

533
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:51,664
Mere passage from the flesh
cannot undo centuries of evil.
