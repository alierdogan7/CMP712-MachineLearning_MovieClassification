<i>Parasites

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,047
then they hatch and
consume the creature

108
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,383
from the inside out.

109
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,320
Margaret Allerdyce

111
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,858
I think
they're wasps.

112
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,326
Wasps.

113
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:08,598
Where have these things
come from?

114
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,100
<i>Well,
they're prehistoric.</i>

115
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:12,035
There's
no recorded instance

116
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,038
of a human ever being
parasited by an ichneumonidae.

117
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:18,041
So this is
the first time

118
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,444
this species has been in
contact with a human population.

119
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:26,249
Because Fortitude has only
been inhabited for 100 years.

120
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,051
They're way older
than that.

121
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,420
So where could they
have come from?

122
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,188
Permafrost?

123
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:34,991
They could survive
frozen in the permafrost?

124
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,493
<i>If they were
in a larval state</i>

125

No. I've never seen

You know he attacked

158
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:29,649
Jason's out there,
and the whole town

159
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:31,084

Jason found the

166
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,600
Now we think
those remains

167
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,869

infectious,

168
