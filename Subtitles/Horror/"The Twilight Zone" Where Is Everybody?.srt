1
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:16,769
It's so green.

2
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:18,764
Well, hello there, folks.

3
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,504
Hi. We're movin' in today.

4
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:22,637
Ah. Could I see
some I.D., please?

5
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,238
Thank you.

6
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,681
Well, welcome
to Evergreen Estates...

7
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:33,155
Mr. and Mrs. Winslow.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,487
The, uh, moving van...

9
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:35,492
delivered your things
this morning.

10
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:36,720
Thank you.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,387
And these must be
your daughters.

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,896
Hello there, sunshine.

13
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:47,894
I have a sunflower on my ass
if you're interested.

14
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,938
Maple street
is your third left turn.

15
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:12,121
Meet the Winslows:

16
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:14,131
a family searching
for a way...

17
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,792
to control
their troubled teen.

18
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,460
How far
they're willing to go...

19
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,332
will take them
to a gated community...

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,895
whose address
can only be found...

21
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,237
in The Twilight Zone.

22
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,308
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna...

23
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:31,837
let your bad attitude
get to me...

24
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,713
but damn it, I am tired
of your antics.

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:35,275
Ed, please. You know
what the doctor said...

26
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,286
about getting upset.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,287
You think she cares...

28
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:38,481
if she gives me
another heart attack?

29
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,251
That is mean.

30
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,054
You should apologize, daddy.

31
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,286
Did she apologize to me...

32
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:44,658
when she nearly
burned down her school?

33
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:46,162
Did she apologize to anyone?

34
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:49,633
All right. I see the geeks...

35
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,336
now show me some freaks.

36
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,272
What's that?

37
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:59,901
I don't know.

38
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:03,277
She's not the only one
who feels like crying.

39
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,292
Hel-lo.

40
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,165
Break time!

41
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:26,464
I'll have a shot of tequila...

42
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:27,834
with a lime wedge.

43
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,175
Or... lemonade will work.

44
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:08,138
The lemonade...

45
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,713
what did you guys put in it?

46
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:14,149
Honey, it's for your own good.

47
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,628
You're traveling
to another dimension...

48
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,296
a dimension not only
of sight and sound...

49
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:35,328
but of mind...

50
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,976
a journey
into a wondrous land...

51
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,344
whose boundaries are only that
of the imagination.

52
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,978
You're entering...

53
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,502
The Twilight Zone.

54
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:14,402
What?

55
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:21,614
What the?

56
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,770
What?

57
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,800
What?! Crap!

58
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:50,337
You bastards!

59
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,781
Mommy, how could
you do this to me?

60
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,249
This is my body!

61
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,410
And look how you've been
treating it.

62
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:56,419
Ed.

63
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:57,647
Oh, what?

64
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,053
You don't like
my tattoos, huh?

65
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,522
I'll get bigger ones!

66
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,455
You don't like my hair?

67
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:02,720
I'll shave it off!

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,888
They made me take
my earrings off, too.

69
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:07,829
This is insane!

70
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,163
You drug me, you take my tats...

71
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,565
my CDs, everything!

72
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,331
Honey, it is
for your own good.

73
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,270
Your parents love you
very much, Jenna.

74
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:16,772
They've told me many times.

75
00:05:16,807 --> 00:05:17,933
Who the hell are you?

76
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,442
Cliff Brooks...

77
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,909
head of the Evergreen
Homeowners Association.

78
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,468
So this was your idea?

79
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:25,004
Jenna, do you realize...

80
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,743
what your parents
had to sacrifice...

81
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,751
to move here?

82
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,184
Everything we own.

83
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:32,154
Your parents
are providing you...

84
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,679
a haven from
the outside world...

85
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:36,022
with its drugs, gangster
rap, violent movies.

86
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:38,084
Oh, you mean
everything I care about?

87
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,358
Life is full of trade-offs.

88
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:42,365
Whatever.

89
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,594
You're not gonna change me.

90
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,526
That wasn't fair, daddy.

91
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,601
Cigarettes gave daddy
a heart attack.

92
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,706
Not according to him.
He thinks I did.

93
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,547
How'd you sneak
'em in, anyway?

94
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,076
In the trunk, underneath
the jumper cables.

95
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:08,789
Listen, Jules,
I gotta get outta here.

96
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,851
You mean running away?

97
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,452
Yeah. I... I gotta get away...

98
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,225
while I still know who I am.

99
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,232
You're just gonna leave me here?

100
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:18,234
No. I'll come back for you...

101
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,735
just as soon as I get
a place, some money...

102
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,135
The hell you will.

103
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,402
Hey, watch your language.

104
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,409
But mom and dad moved here...

105
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:28,172
because of you.

106
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:31,113
Well, maybe they can
get a refund.

107
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,885
Mike. Wait.
How you guys doin'?

108
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:51,732
So they got you with
the lemonade, too, huh?

109
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,895
Yep, the same way
they stripped me clean...

110
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,370
my first night here.

111
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,832
Welcome to heavenly Evergreen.

112
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,468
How long have you lived here?

113
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,877
Long enough to know
that if there was a way out...

114
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,437
I'd have found it already.

115
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,541
How do you survive?

116
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,245
I got ways.

117
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:11,547
I'm Logan.

118
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:13,289
Jenna.

119
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,483
Winslow, I know.

120
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,560
16 years old.

121
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:19,789
Arrested twice for possession.

122
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,663
Got suspended from Holy Cross...

123
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,223
for sleeping with
a teacher's aide. Nice.

124
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:26,133
I... I'm assuming it was a "he."

125
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,330
How do you know about all this?

126
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,670
Well, the Homeowners
Association has files...

127
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,299
on all the families
living here...

128
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:36,540
and I happen to have
a key to the file room.

129
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,572
This place is like a prison.

130
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:43,313
Yeah. Although it's not
as bad as Arcadia.

131
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:44,411
Arcadia? What's that?

132
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,446
I think it's, like...
like a military school.

133
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:49,391
See, if you piss people off...

134
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:50,688
that's where they send you.

135
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,422
And if Brooks and the rest
of the storm troopers...

136
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,158
send you someplace,
you know it ain't good.

137
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,758
So, what do you do
to have fun around here?

138
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,029
Well, there's...

139
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,468
there's always homework.

140
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,703
Or I got a stash of MP3s...

141
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:07,972
a bottle of Jack,
and a little weed...

142
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:09,740
all buried not far from here.

143
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,179
My hero.

144
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:14,012
There's a community picnic
this Saturday...

145
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:16,781
sack races, 3-bean salad...

146
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,084
clay making for the kiddies.

147
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:21,249
Oh, you'll be there.
Yeah, it's mandatory.

148
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,758
Everyone's there.

149
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:28,390
But I say that we meet up...

150
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,457
grab a blanket...

151
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,833
sneak back up here,
and break some rules.

152
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:38,736
I'm in.

153
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:55,281
That's the way I like it.

154
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,705
<i>You should
have him come over...</i>

155
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,799
<i>spend some time.</i>

156
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:33,559
<i>Found him yet?</i>

157
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:35,064
<i>Not yet, but we will.</i>

158
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:36,224
<i>There's no place to hide.</i>

159
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,927
<i>I'm afraid he's gone.</i>

160
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:42,833
Jack, seriously...

161
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,070
Logan's had plenty of chances.

162
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:47,906
He's our only son.

163
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:50,777
His fate is in the hands
of the Community Council.

164
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:56,745
Jules, what are you doing
sneaking around?

165
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:57,947
You're supposed to be in bed.

166
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:01,219
So should you. It's past 10:00.

167
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,726
Oh, I'm breaking
my curfew. I'm so scared.

168
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,729
They're gonna send me
to Arcadia. Oh, no.

169
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:08,287
I'll be good. I promise.

170
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,060
That's not funny.

171
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,632
What are you doing reading
the Evergreen bylaws?

172
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:17,970
Huh?

173
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,977
This crap
will warp your brain!

174
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,381
I'm just doing it
to make mom and dad happy.

175
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:32,455
You coming inside?

176
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:33,820
In a minute.

177
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:36,686
Wait.

178
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,264
No good night?

179
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,397
You can be such
a butthead sometimes.

180
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,133
That's me.

181
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,416
Mom! Dad!

182
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,922
It's me! Let me in!

183
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,720
Let me in! It's me!

184
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,018
Logan!

185
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,327
Hide! Now!

186
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:22,430
Logan... surrender.

187
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,770
There is nowhere to run.

188
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:30,703
What took you
chuckleheads so long?

189
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:58,432
Jenna! Downstairs, right now!

190
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,840
Coming!

191
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:10,175
We'd like to talk
to you about Logan.

192
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:12,917
What about him?

193
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,856
He's in very serious trouble.

194
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,256
Several witnesses
saw the two of you...

195
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,783
together the other day.

196
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,729
Yeah, so? We weren't
doing anything.

197
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:23,522
Did you know about all that crap
he had buried in the woods?

198
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,794
Look, who's in trouble here,
me or him?

199
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:28,542
Are you aware that he had
a hunting knife out there, too?

200
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,763
And he attacked
one of our security guards...

201
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,035
quite brutally, I might add.

202
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,441
Logan...

203
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:42,417
I told him that he was
gonna get in trouble.

204
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:45,818
I know this has been...

205
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,585
a difficult transition
for you, Jenna.

206
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:49,854
In the future...

207
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:53,124
if someone approaches you
with anything off-limits...

208
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,393
I'd like to believe
you'll report it.

209
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:02,202
I'll keep my eyes open.

210
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,639
We'd appreciate it.

211
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,950
You know your daughter.
Can we trust her?

212
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,543
<i>I'd like to think so.</i>

213
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,520
<i>What's gonna
happen to that boy?</i>

214
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:20,284
<i>Oh, he'll turn over
a new leaf...</i>

215
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:21,790
<i>one way or the another.</i>

216
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:23,292
<i>We'll decide at
the Community Council...</i>

217
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,988
<i>at the high school tonight,
which is mandatory, by the way.</i>

218
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,426
Look, I'm tellin' you...

219
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,058
there is somethin' seriously
wrong with this place.

220
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,069
I went online and ran
all kinds of searches...

221
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,162
on Arcadia Military School.

222
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,502
There's no such thing.

223
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,801
There's no school
with that name.

224
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,240
Well, why would
they lie about that?

225
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,141
I don't know, but I know
that they are lying about...

226
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,769
Logan cutting up that guard.

227
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:44,643
There's no way.
There is just no way.

228
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,012
So what are you gonna do?

229
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:49,644
I'm gonna figure out
what's going on around here.

230
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,677
We should get back inside.

231
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:55,316
Jen, mom and dad
signed a contract.

232
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,588
If we get kicked out
of this place...

233
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,254
we lose everything.

234
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:04,623
You're gonna have to trust me.

235
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,863
OK, Jules?

236
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,761
West side, report.

237
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:12,240
7-10. All clear.

238
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,056
While we wait
for the official count...

239
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:06,995
I'd like to move on
to other business.

240
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,124
Now, in the light
of this recent incident...

241
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,533
I propose that we
instate random car checks...

242
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,231
upon reentry into Evergreen.

243
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:17,398
Obviously, this is troubling...

244
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,067
but unless we stop contraband...

245
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,406
from coming into
this community...

246
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:21,740
we're gonna find ourselves...

247
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:23,575
right back here
in the same situation.

248
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:34,583
Uh, Ron... Nell...

249
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,251
I want you to remember...

250
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,123
that Logan will always
have a place in this community.

251
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:42,495
We've already picked out
a beautiful spot for his tree.

252
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:53,203
For God's sake,
he's my only child.

253
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
A number of us have
sent kids off to Arcadia...

254
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,309
myself included.

255
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:05,412
But it must be done for
the good of this community.

256
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:08,652
And people, let us not forget...

257
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,591
that we've saved
plenty more than we've lost.

258
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:11,889
Plenty more!

259
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,954
And if we have to toss out
a few bad apples...

260
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:18,092
I say it's worth it.

261
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:19,692
Let's face it...

262
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:21,226
Evergreen is the good life.

263
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,829
Keep moving.

264
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,933
<i>We got the Agar boy.
We're bringing him in.</i>

265
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:47,428
Logan!

266
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,658
Get out!

267
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:49,687
The sign!

268
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:51,597
- What?
- The sign!

269
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:52,760
Get out!

270
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:55,794
Don't! Run! Run!

271
00:16:58,441 --> 00:16:59,533
Run!

272
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,975
Looks like one
of the Winslow girls.

273
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:14,283
Jules! Jules! Jules!

274
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,552
Hurry up, wake up.
I need your help.

275
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:16,684
What's going on?

276
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:17,715
I gotta get out of here
before they find me.

277
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,125
They're gonna
be here any minute.

278
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:20,220
What'd you do this time?

279
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,730
I can't explain it to you.

280
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:22,890
You wouldn't even believe me
if I told you.

281
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,797
- It's a nightmare.
- You're scaring me.

282
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,267
Just listen to me, OK, Jules?

283
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,701
All right, when they get here,
I want you to tell them...

284
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:29,227
that you saw me,
and you spoke to me...

285
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:31,035
and I said that I was
gonna be hiding...

286
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:33,406
in the ravine
down by Willow Road.

287
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,001
Where will you really be?

288
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:36,909
I'm gonna be
waiting for you, OK...

289
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:38,379
at the park down the street.

290
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:40,541
As soon as they leave,
I want you to sneak out...

291
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,847
and come find me, OK?

292
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:45,047
We're gonna find a way
out of this together.

293
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:47,579
I promise.

294
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,819
Can you do this for me?

295
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:53,618
Ok?

296
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,335
Jules?

297
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,369
You scared me.

298
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,746
Jules, what's wrong?

299
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,056
Why?

300
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,689
Jules, why?

301
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:33,634
You were going to ruin
everything again.

302
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:40,567
No!

303
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:52,251
Mommy! Daddy!
Please don't let me...

304
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,687
please don't do this!

305
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:57,056
Mommy, daddy, please don't
let them do this to me!

306
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:00,426
Mommy, daddy, please don't
let them do this to me!

307
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,899
Now, Julie...

308
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:37,358
Let this tree be a reminder...

309
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,697
that there's something good...

310
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,533
in each and every one of us.

311
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,766
That's my good girl.

312
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,407
The Winslows have finally...

313
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:58,249
taken back control
of their family...

314
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:01,883
but it cost them
one teenage daughter...

315
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:06,725
a deal brokered only
in The Twilight Zone.
