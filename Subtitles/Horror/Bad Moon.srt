Thor thought he heard something
in the woods, practically threw a fit.

367
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,775
Woke up the whole house.
Lucky you were in the Airstream.

368
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,910
Anyway, I finally let him out.

369
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,438
He ran out into the woods
and he didn't come back.

370
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:43,192
I tried calling him with that dog
whistle but he kept barking.

371
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,703
So?

372
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,538
What did he find?

373
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,536
Nothing.

374
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,628
What do you think it was all about?

I'm not that worried.

Big predators, they can travel a long
distance if their habitat runs dry.

Just because there hasn't been
anything dangerous in this forest recently

380

doesn't mean it's always gonna be safe.

If I were you, I wouldn't let Brett
play out there for awhile until...

383
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:22,914
There weren't supposed to be
any wolves up where I am.

384
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,749

I mean it's the same difference!

All I'm saying is you have
to be a little more cautious.

Take the dog more seriously
and don't let him play out there.
