It was my understanding that Captain
Bingley was in want of a wife.

Oh, he is.

Those are his sisters,
Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst.

180

nearly £100,000.

I consider dancing to be the first
refinement of polished society.

219

Don't you agree, Mr. Darcy?

220
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,968
No.
Every savage can dance.

221

do it to some degree of success.

522
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,009
Has Anne been presented?

523
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,111
Oh, no. No, Mrs. Bennet.

524
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,914
Her ill health prevents it.

525
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,682
I told Lady Catherine that
the court has been deprived

526
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,986
of its brightest ornament.

527
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:19,189
I have a talent, you see, for delivering
these very delicate compliments

528
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,591
with an unstudied air.

529
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,761
It would seem, sir, that all
you lack now is a wife.

530
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,866
I must confess,
Mrs. Bennet,

531
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,602
the fairest wifely choices
be right here in this room.

(GLASS CLINKS)

533
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,541
I declare that I am

534
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,110
enchanted by
your daughter, Jane.

535
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,915
And request to speak
to her alone, if I may.

536
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,550
MRS. BENNET: Oh, dear Parson.

537
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,485
I'm afraid Jane
is already spoken for.

538
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,287
We expect a serious
proposal imminently.

539
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,558
Oh, fuddle.

540
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
But Liz is
quite available,

541
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:58,161
and almost
as fair as Jane.

542
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,763
BOTH: (MOUTHING) What?

543
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,800
Is there absolutely
no negotiating over Jane?

544
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:06,636
The early bird catches the worm, Mr.
Collins. Oh, indeed.

545
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,339
Be mindful of your talent
for the delicate compliment, sir.

546
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,509
Oh, no. Yeah...
Why, yes...

547
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:16,213
She is almost as fair
as the other one.

548
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,448
Splendid.

this morning,

552

00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,234

willing to accompany you.

557
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,136

of course.

559
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,006
Well, I should
be delighted,

560
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:46,977
but only if Mr. Bennet will consent
to release me from my reading.

561
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,845
With a heavy heart, sir.

562
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,614
Mr. Bennet, I am
susceptible to flattery,

563
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:53,416
and you, sir,
are very charming.

567
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,591

I must confess,

589
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,527
I was unaware that
zombies possessed

590
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:13,663
the required acuity
to set such traps.

591

be running for Parliament.

to our Meryton regiment

in your regimentals.

a prior engagement.

624
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,757
I said she is baking.

625
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,227
I was very keen to be on time

626
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,863
because, apparently, Aunt Phillips'
muffins are splendid, you see.

627
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,198
Is that so?

628
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,168
Yeah, and Lady Catherine
herself abhors tardiness,

629
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,404

with a real sense of order.

for accompanying us

Are you going to be stationed
here all winter, Mr. Wickham?

635
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,717
Well, that depends entirely
on what the manky dreadfuls

636
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,039
have in store for us,
Miss Bennet.

you promised

641
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,965
you'd throw a ball
at Netherfield.

642
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,937
Are you quite recovered?
She is.

643
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,472
Then I shall begin
the preparations immediately

644
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,640
for the most glorious ball
Hertfordshire has ever seen.

00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,269

Lieutenant Wickham come?

646
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,083
Of course, an invitation shall be
sent to all my fellow officers.

647
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,655
Excuse me.

00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,896

my beautiful nieces.

650
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,531
Oh!

651
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,337
Please join us, Mr. Wickham.

652
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,738
No. Duty calls, I'm afraid.

653
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,740
Oh...

654
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,808
Um...

655
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,476
I must know, Mr. Wickham,

656
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,073
what is amiss
between you and Mr. Darcy?

657
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,031
Are you much
acquainted with him?

658
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,454
More than I wish to be.

659
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,889
He's been here for
less than a month

660
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,891
and is already the least
popular man in the county.

661
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,728
Yes, it always gives me
great pain to see him.

662
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,130
I have been connected
with his family from infancy.

663
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,932
My father managed
the late Mr. Darcy's estate.

664
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,021
Darcy and I
grew up together.

665
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,704
His father treated
me like a second son.

666
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:44,574
I cannot begin to do
justice to his kindness.

667
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,576
He bequeathed me with the
best living in his gift.

668
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,178
I had my heart set
on joining the church.

669
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,648
But when he was slain
in the Second Battle of Kent,

670
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,970
Darcy ignored his wishes and
gave my living to another man.

671
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,953
What could have induced
him to behave so cruelly?

672
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,489
Pride.

673
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,227
He thought me too low to be
worth his consideration.

674
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,162
I loved his father dearly,
so, I can never expose Darcy

675
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,430
or challenge him to a duel.

would keep you away.

he must go, not I.

873
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:49,431
Did you happen to see four
gentlemen pass this way?

874
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,169
In top hats?
You saw them?

875
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:56,372
No, but they were
undoubtedly pallbearers.

876
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,439
This is a cemetery.

877
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,676
Uh, Miss Bennet?

878
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:06,482
I want to take you somewhere
very special to me.

879
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,724
It's a secret place I've never
shown another living soul.

880
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,988
I stumbled upon it
quite by accident

881
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,991
when I was first stationed
in The In-Between.

882
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:18,727
But somehow, I believe I was always
destined to find it, Miss Bennet.

883
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,654
You go in. I'll join you
after I see to my horse.

884
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,860
Don't be afraid.

885
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:54,997
I'm not.

886
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,238
MAN: "And I brought
your fathers out of Egypt.

887
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,840

00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:34,470
WICKHAM: No, don't! Don't.

901
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,339
It's all right.

902
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,708
It's all right.

903
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,412
"Happy are those

(GASPS) Brains.
No. They're pigs' brains.

909
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,538
You have nothing to fear.

910
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,807
You see, if they
never consume human brains

911
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,777
they will never fully
transform into zombies.

912
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:16,679
St. Lazarus is the key
to finally ending

913
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,647
the struggle between
the living and the undead.

914
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,349
We must force some
kind of understanding

915
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,851
with the most advanced
among them.

916
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,821
Well, surely the Crown
will support such a venture.

917
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,490
The war has almost
bankrupted Great Britain.

918
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,925
I know not where to turn.

919
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,962
It's only a matter of time
before they outnumber us.

920
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,701
GUARD: Rider at the gate!

921
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:41,003
Attention!

Charlotte?

923
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,315
I didn't know
you were coming to visit.

924
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:54,650
I have some news.

925
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,054
I'm engaged to be
married to Mr. Collins.

926
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,094
You must be surprised.

927
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,197
I'm not. I'm relieved.

928
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,598
I believe that my chance
of happiness with him

929
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,967
is as fair as most
women can hope for.

930
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,905
And that's all you expect?

931
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,607
At 25, it's more
than I expect.

932
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,912
(SIGHS)

933
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:29,451
Charlotte, if you're
happy for you, then I am, too.

(CHUCKLES)

935
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,624
Well, I am to be
presented to Lady Catherine

936
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:38,260
and if I am to stay the night
at Mr. Collins' rectory,

937
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:39,928
I will require a chaperone.

938
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,867
Charlotte... She's said to be
quite an imposing figure.

939
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:47,736
And the thought of facing her without
you makes me deathly nervous.

940
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,304
So, please?

941
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,572
(CHUCKLES)

942
00:56:55,979 --> 00:57:00,449
I'll come, but I have
one stipulation.

943
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,217
Anything.

944
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:04,119
COLLINS: Now,
when we meet Lady Catherine,

945
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:06,388
a simple curtsey will suffice.

946
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,892
Maintain eye contact, but don't
speak unless spoken to, please.

947
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,163
Lady Catherine's
famed Black Guard.

948
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:16,398
They can't move.

949
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,035
Here, look at this, you could
tickle him with a feather. Oh!

950
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,904
GUARD: Lower the gate!

951
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:25,507
COLLINS: An extraordinary
sight, is it not? Oh!

952
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,578
Such splendor.

00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,618
<i>Lady Catherine

954
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,554

00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,712

LADY CATHERINE:
So you are Elizabeth Bennet.

I am, Your Ladyship.

967
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,636

00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,442
COLLINS: Well,
it's very kind of you

969
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:36,945
to invite us over for tea,
Lady Catherine. Really.

970
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,146
(DOOR OPENS)
Very grateful.

971
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,415
Mr. Darcy?

972
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,585
Miss Bennet.

973
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,154
You know my nephew?

974
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:48,790
Yes, I had
the tremendous pleasure

975
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,032
of meeting him
in Hertfordshire.

976
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,328
Mr. Wickham.

977
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,731
Is this the soldier you spoke of?
FRANKLIN: Yes.

978
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:57,132
Miss Bennet
requested he attend,

979
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:58,901
that he might
confer with Your Ladyship

980
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,136
about a strategy with which
to combat the scourge.

981
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,273
Mmm, a lieutenant? Really?

982
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:05,474

00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,609

is brought up.

00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,478
Oh! Shall we?
Oh, delighted to.

985
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,579
Please.

wealthiest woman in the kingdom.

The rest is up to you.

WICKHAM: <i>Your Ladyship
has perhaps heard</i>

989
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:24,159
that some of the stricken
have not succumbed

990
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,761
to the urge to feed
upon the living,

991
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:27,863
and in so doing have
maintained their human ways.

992
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,464
And they have
managed to resist this

993
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:31,466
most primal of
zombie urges, how?

994
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:33,435

996
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:38,507
Yes, fortified by religious
piety and pigs' brains,

997
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,609
which they receive in communion
as the blood of Christ.

998
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,945
The pig brains quench their
appetite for human brains.

999
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,013
Oh, yes, of course.

1000
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,682
The Crown's funds
have been drained.

1001
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,184
You're here to
solicit money?

1002
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:51,486
I am here to propose a venture
that would end the war forever.

1003
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:54,623
These new zombies
can be reasoned with.

1004
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,792
With the proper funding,
I believe we can cultivate trust

1005
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:59,661
and even goodwill with this
new iteration of the undead,

1006
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:01,396
who seem to possess
an inherent power

1007
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,931
over the lower
ranks of their kind.

Zombie aristocrats?

(LAUGHING)

1011
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,074
Oh, yeah.

1012
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,217
WICKHAM: I prefer to think of
them as souls lost in purgatory.

1013
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,848
The common hordes
look to them for leadership.

1014
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,850
It takes just one of them
to realize their power

1015
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,085
and then to lead
the hordes into battle...

1016
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:25,187
The undead are like locusts.
Locusts.

1017
01:00:25,189 --> 01:00:29,558
They go forth and destroy.
They have no use for leaders.

1018
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,393
COLLINS: Oh, um, except one. Actually.
Hmm?

1019
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,965
Oh, well, um, according
to the Book of Revelation, actually,

1020
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,202
the Antichrist
shall lead the undead

1021
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:44,973
on the day that shall be
the last day of mankind.

1022
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,376
How cheery, Collins.
Thank you, Lady Catherine.

1023
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:50,045
Very generous. Franklin,
are there more scones?

1024
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,080
WICKHAM: If we could negotiate
with this select group of...

1025
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,049
LADY CATHERINE:
Aristocrats? To what end?

1026
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,484
A treaty.

1027
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:56,985
DARCY: Appeasement?

1028
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,253
Never.

1029
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,255
Well, then the human
race is surely doomed.

1030
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,960
Your Ladyship, the undead
will always multiply faster

1031
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,528
than the living can procreate.

1032
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:07,796
Nine months to make a baby,

1033
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:09,765
then 16 years
to make a soldier,

1034
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,668
and one raw second
to make a zombie.

1035
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,504
You must realize, if they were to
organize, we cannot defeat them.

1036
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:18,173
The only hope is to find a way
to coexist with them,

1037
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,809
before they find
their Antichrist.

1038
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:30,224
I have tolerated your presence
here long enough, Wickham.

1040
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,463
Please do remember
this moment,

1041
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:43,365
and the opportunity
so glibly spurned.

1042
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,202
The day of the zombie
has already broken.

1043
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,471
Wake and face the light,
or slumber into oblivion.

1044
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,454
Mr. Darcy, you are
