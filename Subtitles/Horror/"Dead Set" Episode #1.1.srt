I mean, you know,
what is TV, anyway?

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,660
It's just a big fat arrow
pointing away from the problem.

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,170
Especially shows like this.

Mmm.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,260
I thought to myself,
"OK, I can ignore it,

12

"or I can engage with
and alter it from within."

You know, and if just one person

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,980
hears me and thinks, "Wow.

"l never saw it like that.
This guy's really opened my head,"

16

Who would you like to kill?

25
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,180
- Who do you think? Wonderbra.
- And her spastic henchman.

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,980

It sounded like someone
spanking a wet rat!

(Angel) And who needs to hear that?

when they grunt.

from my mistakes

we fully went through

00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,940
..and the cameras ain't moving.

528
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,220
Big Brother ain't watching us.

529
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,650
(Shit.)

530
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,370
Shit.

531
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,450
YELLING

532
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,270
Aargh! Aargh!

533
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,940
Aargh!

YELLING AND ROARING

535
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:04,220
SOBBING

536
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,020
(Veronica) This ain't right.
No cameras, no fucking point.

537
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,900
- (Marky) They might be broken.
- (Joplin) All of them?

538
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,820
- Could be electrics.
- They're doing it on purpose.

539
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,340
- Yeah, like a task.
- Where the cameras don't move?

540
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,820
Like that's gonna be entertaining.

541
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:18,460
(Joplin) They want to see how we react
to a sudden absence of authority.

542
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,220
Well, it's freaking me right out.

543
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,420
That's what they want.
Don't give it to them.

544
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,470
- We're not freaked out!
- I am!

545
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,380
MUFFLED ARGUING

546
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,340
(Veronica) Give me the answer.
Tell me what's going on.

547
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,020
(Angel) Big Brother, man,
what the fuck...?

548
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,260
(Veronica) Look, we've been
really good, playing games.

549
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,520
We just wanna know what's going on.

550
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,420
(Veronica) Hello?

551
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,380
(Angel) If the cameras don't start
moving any minute, I'm walking.

552
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,890
Remember I told you...

553
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,020
- I'm going on the roof.
- We're not allowed there!

554
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,260
Exactly! If they don't stop me, we'll
know something's definitely wrong.

555
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,770

(Grayson) They'll throw you out!

559
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,340
Just leave him!
Let 'em throw him out!

560
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,500
(Angel) You know what? Fuck 'em.

561
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,580
- (Grayson) Oh, my God!
- (Veronica) Look!

562
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,300
(Veronica) That's what it is!
They've given us a new housemate!

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

564
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,940
Oh, fucking hell. Unbelievable!

565
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,380
See, I told you!

566
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,340
(Veronica) Course it is! Look at her!

567
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,500
- She's a bit strange.
- What's your name, then?

568
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,220
- (Marky) Uh...
- (Angel) Coo-ee! Hello!

LAUGHING

570
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,650
What's she doing?

571
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,370
Hello?

572
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,260
Fine. Whatever.

573
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,660
- Are you a mong?
- Shh! She might be.

574
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,300
(Angel) Is that fake blood on her?

575
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,220
(Grayson) Don't listen to them.
They're idiots, sweetheart.

576
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,460
- I wouldn't bother, Gray.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

577
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,740
(Marky) Let Joppers in.
Come on, Jops.

578
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,260
Um, 'hello'.

579
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:11,890
My 'name' is Joplin.

580

SNIGGERING

581
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,350
And I'm 'happy' to 'meet you'.

582
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,020
- There's one in there.
- One what?

583
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,580
(Grayson) Have you been outside
all this time?

584
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,780
Can I ask you a question?

585
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,780
- How am I coming across?
- (Marky) Oh, you big queen.

586
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,340
- Am I popular?
- Yeah, you're the favourite.

587
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,340
Ha! No autographs for you.
Hear that? I'm the favourite!

588
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,260
- This is such a put-on this!
- Is that fake blood?

589
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,700
Shut up.

590
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,220
You must try harder.
LAUGHING

591
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,660
- I said shut up!
- (Grayson) All right.

592
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,300
She's mental. Look at her.
Her mechanism's gone.

593
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:49,870
(Angel) It's just attention-seeking.
Ignore her, she'll stop.

594
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,930
GROWLING
Fuck.

595
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,540

Fuck.

598
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,220
(Marky) Did they give you
specific instructions,

599
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,220
or just tell you to come in
and act weird?

600
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:47,680
- I'm not acting. I work here.
- What, as a window-cleaner?

601
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,980
Something's happening.
Some sort of outbreak.

602
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,860
- Oh, here we go.
- Just let her talk.

603
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,060
OK. Go on.

604
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,090
- People get this thing.
- Thing?

605
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,740
They wanna kill you, and they change.

606
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,260
And then their bums fall off.
LAUGHING

607
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,340
- What do you mean, they change?
- I dunno. They're dead.

608
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,500
- Dead?
- Sorry, what did you say?

609
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,820
They're dead.

610
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,500
They're dead,
and they're still alive.

611
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,100
They're everywhere.

612
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,580
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

613
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,540
- There's one in here.
- This is quality, this is.

614
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,420
Hammer House of horseshit.

615
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,930
You're brilliant, you.

616
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,780
Come on, now. That's enough.

Is that Davina?

626
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,050
Sort of.

627
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,610
Get off my fucking suit.

628
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,180
(Joplin) Dear Big Brother,
may I say how impressed I was

629
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,420
at your inclusion of a clearly
mentally unhinged woman

630
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,180
into the house?

631
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,660
Maybe something has happened.

632
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,300
(Veronica) I just wanna know, is that
fake blood? I just wanna know.

633
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,780
(Joplin) Even if she's not mentally ill,
this is in very poor taste.

634
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,700
(Marky) You seriously think
there's a bunch of dead biffers

635
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,260
strolling about, eating people?

636
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,420
They're coming to get you, Barbara.
(Manic laughing)

637
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,820
Well, I just want it noted
that I do not approve of this.

638
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,900
Shut up! Shut up, you fucking idiots!

639
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,620
You fucking idiots! I'm trying
to tell you there's one in there!

You're live on Channel 4!
Don't swear or say "fuck" or nothing!

644
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,050
Maybe he's deaf and dead.

645
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,660
Hello? Hello?

646
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,260
No, can't hear anything.

647
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,380
Don't do that.
(Marky) There's nothing here.

648
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,700
(Veronica) Marky, get away from that.
It's the fire exit.

649
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,180
Don't open that door.

650
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,100
What, this door?

651
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,300
- Open that door and I'll stab you.
- What?

652
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,780
Marky, don't wind her up.
Seriously, she's fucking weird.

653
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,260
Shut the door!
(Angel) Shut the door!

654
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,940
Shut the fucking door!

655
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,740
- Close it! Fucking close the door!
- Marky, close it.

656
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,900
You fucking well
better close the fucking door!

657
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,820
All right! Fucking hell!

658
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,300
What you gonna do with them?

659
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,150
Sorry. I'm just having a look.

You've got to get them in the head.
