171
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,549
Thanks.

175
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,713
Oh, kitty! Muffin, I'm sorry.
Oh, Muffin. Kitty?

176
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,177
Here, kitty. Muffin.
Oh, yes. It's okay.

177
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,692
- Let's go by and scare the girls tonight.
- But we're not invited.

178
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,142
Just a baby scare. I mean,
you know girls love to scream.

179
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,192
I don't know.

180
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,289
What's the worst that can happen?
I mean, so they get mad at us.

181
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,443
- They could beat the shit out of us.
- Like they did in the fucking gym.

182
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,949
Three times.

183
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,561
That's them now.

184
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,393
Go ahead and finish your coffee.

185
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,774
- Who is it?
- We're here for the orgy.

186
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,403
Open the door, let us in. Hurry!

187
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:10,412
Look what I scored from my older
brother. And that ain't the half of it.

188
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,244
Gee, that's swell. Soda pop.

189
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,005
What's the matter with you?

190
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,638
Cast your eyes on this.

191
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:30,641

193
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,101
I was just leaving.

194
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:41,902
Trish, I won't tell if you don't let your
parents know I scared you to death, okay?

195
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,659
- Hey, go easy on the Maui Wowie.
- For sure, Mr. Contant.

196
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,985
And if you need me
I'm right next door.

197
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,242
- Thanks.
- Good night.

198
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,559
- Big doings next door, I see.
- It's none of our business.

199
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,566
How come you weren't
invited to the party?

200
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,192
I was. I just turned them down so I could
take care of my darling little sister.

201
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,065
Like hell.

202

Jones once said...

205
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,043
Hello?

206
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,964
Yeah, hold on. It's some boy.

207
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,793
Hello?

208
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,461
Hi, Gordon.

209
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,389
Quit glommin' all the chips.

210
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,688
This is the best time to do it, before
Diane gets here and eats them all.

211
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,686
Quit glommin' the joint.

212
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,021
- What does that guy see in her, anyway?
- She's beautiful.

213
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,196
I think she has a big mouth.

214
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,038
Hey, it's not how big your mouth is.
It's what's in it that counts.

215
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,867
What I don't see is what
she sees in John Minor.

216
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,330
Maybe it's what we don't see.

217
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,873
Hey, it's not how big
it is, remember?

218
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:19,541
(IN UNISON)
It's what's in it that counts.

219
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,599
I left the burner on.

220
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,979
- Will your mom be mad?
- I'll have to replace it. It's okay.

221
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,711
At a recent Tinseltown bash, the lovely Brook
Shields shocked everyone by turning up

222
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,538
with a new frizzy hairdo.

223
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,621
I thought she looked
like Charles II.

224
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:08,253
And her close friends thought she
stuck her finger in the wall socket.

225
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,384
- Dog's in the trash again.
- So go take care of it.

226
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,221
What do you think I am, stupid?

227
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:19,972
I'm not going out there
alone in the dark. You go.

228
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,024
It's too bad Mom and Dad didn't get
a divorce before you were born.

229
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,322
I love you too.

230
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,251
Talking about getting caught in the
act, guess who got caught in the act?

231
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:12,333
Who?

232
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,428
- Who?
- Got caught in the act?

233
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:16,012
- Yeah. In bed.
- Who?

234
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,558
- Stephanie and Joe.
- What? Are you kidding?

235
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,556
Oh my god.

236
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,558
You know what? That must have been the
reason she didn't show in class Friday.

237
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,024
I have her in my third period
class. She wasn't even there.

238
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:28,976
Well, you know why?

239
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,944
Because she was sore.

240
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,491
They were in bed, and guess
who came up the stairs?

241
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:39,610
- Where were they?
- They were in her house.

242
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,531
- Her parents' house?
- Yeah, her parents' house.

243
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,998
And her parents came up the stairs.

244
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:46,870
Oh my god. What'd they do?

245
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,090
So they just made it.
They didn't get caught.

246
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,257
They just kind of
flew out really fast.

247
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,253
There she goes.

248
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,164
I'm glad I've never been in
that situation, aren't you?

249
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,844
Me too. How embarrassing.

250
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,469
What's the big deal?
I don't get it.

251
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,147
Her parents walked in on them
while they were screwing.

252
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,984
I don't think I've been giving Kim
the attention she deserves.

253
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,773
Who would have guessed?

254
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,069
But Stephanie didn't show
up to third period, right?

255
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,732
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,704
- And Joe hasn't been in class for...
- God, I bet they're grounded forever.

257
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,750
- Well, they didn't get caught, right?
- I know, but they almost got caught, Diane.

258
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:31,964
- Well, it's their fault.
- You've never been in that position, Diane.

259
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,802
- What did we do to deserve this?
- I think we died and went to heaven.

260
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,517
Courtney, what are you doing?

261
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,023
I'm upstairs doing
my biology homework.

262
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,606
Why do I find that hard to believe?

263
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,730
Don't laugh, I have to concentrate.

264
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:00,655
Ok, but do me a favor and don't
tear out the centerfold this time.

265
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,991
What do you say we order a pizza?

266
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,869
- No anchovies.
- Mushrooms and olives.

267
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,249
Hey, since I'm the only one dressed
I'll go get wood for the fire.

268
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,719
Bring it in through the garage
so you don't scuzz up the rug.

269
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,072
Yuck!

270
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,540
Gross.

271
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,044
Hi, Mr. Contant.

272
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,500
Hi Diane, I hope
I didn't startle you.

273
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,879
- No, not at all. You're on a snail hunt?
- Uh-huh. That makes 53 tonight.

274
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,972
And this is the only
good way to get 'em.

275
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:08,719
They come out after dark and
they eat up my vegetable garden.

276
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,139
My dad goes on snail hunts too.
He doesn't like to use pesticides.

277
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,686
It's not organic.

278
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,736
- Right. Goodnight, Mr. Contant.
- Goodnight.

279
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,945

00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,082
Hey, did you hear something?

282
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,510
No, I didn't. Look, I've got
an idea. Come on.

283
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:52,643
Hey, listen to this: Boy, 10,
sucked down sewer but survives.

284
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,607
Diane!

285
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,734
Why don't you read this
thing's horoscopes?

286
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,155
- Sign?
- Scorpio, of course.

287
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,864
Of course.

288
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,410
Your power with the opposite
sex will get you ahead.

289
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:11,873
Not too bad.

290
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,664
Depends on whose head.

291
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,874
Taurus.

292
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,965
You'll get the rest you deserve.
Relax and enjoy it.

Hey, is it getting cold in here?

294
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,420
Sort of.

295

Why don't you read more
about that sewer boy?

boy who was swept into the...

Diane. Did you remember to close the
garage door when you brought the wood in?

299
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,248
I don't know.

My doll, I... I threw
it away this morning.

303
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:13,393
- It must be those boys.
- Close the curtain Jackie.

304
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,641
The garage door...
I have to go check it.

305
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,146
I'll go with you.

306
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,238
Shit, the lightbulb's out.

307
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,292
- See? I closed it.
- Yeah, but you didn't lock it.

308
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,419
My dad's got a lot of
valuables in here.

- Come on, hurry up.
- You have to step on it, like this.

Everything is okay, come on.
Let's get down to some partying.

- Fork it over, shortcakes,
- Why not? I already finished it.

- Pervert.
- Look who's talking.

- Courtney!
- Leave it alone.

Jason is the athletic type.

He enjoys bike riding and
tennis and surfing at dawn.

He's a straight-A student and

Yuck!

319
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,068
You faker. You were beating
off boys in the fifth grade.

I was not, you creep.

Hey Val, did you tell mom?

323
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:07,879
Tell mom what? About the
fifth grade? I made that up.

324
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,962
You did not. I hate you.
I hate you, you creep!

325
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,006
I'll get you for this.

326

Hi, boo boo.

327
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:35,910
Boo boo?

328
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,739
I love you, too. I miss you.

329
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,993
Yeah, it's okay.
Trish doesn't mind.

330
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,913
I love it, too.

331
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,666
Do you think I'm getting better?

332
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,304
Shh. Hold on.

333
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,425
I think our first
amendment's been violated.

334
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,183
Not the word I would have chosen.

335
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,315
Very immature, you guys.

336
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,937
- Oh my god.

Perhaps it we should make a run for
it. Valerie Bates lives next door.

if we all just stuck together now...
