369
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,687
It was thought, Mr. Ward,
that he had gained possession

370
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:21,124
of a book called
the necronomicon.

371
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,691
Have you heard of it?

372
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:25,595
No.

373
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:27,263
Well, it obviously
never existed,

374
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,298
except in the minds
of the superstitious.

375
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:31,634
But they claimed
it held enough secrets

376
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:34,337
to give a man
absolute power.

377
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:38,907
Of course, every mythology
has such a book,

378
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:43,112
but the necronomicon
supposedly contained formulas

379
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:48,684
through which one could communicate
with or even summon the elder gods...

380
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:53,322
the dark ones from beyond
who had once ruled the world

381
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,693
and now are merely waiting for an
opportunity to regain that control.

384

Still, the people
of Arkham believed it.

385
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:12,308
They claimed that Joseph Curwen
and two other warlocks

386
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,711
were trying to open the
gates to these dark gods.

387

388

Joseph Curwen was trying

with humans

could regain their control.
