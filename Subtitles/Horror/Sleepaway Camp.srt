Okay, let me have your
attention for one minute.

683
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,528
The last few days we've been using
the regular activity schedule.

684
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,238
And that bites the big one,

685
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,782
so today we're going
to try something a little different, okay?

686
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,535
Like in Color War,
you're gonna be separated into

687
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,996
two groups and we're gonna
play capture the flag.

688
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:16,044
For you guys who have never played before,
Gene is going to explain the rules.

689
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,713
Alright, gangsters, listen up,
because this is going to be a lot of fun.

690
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:21,925
Now, depending on what team you're on,
you're going to be wearing white strips

691
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:25,428
or blue strips. The guys with the blue
strips have to capture the white flag,

692
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,597
and the guys with the white strips
have to capture the blue flag.

693
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,890
Sounds easy enough, right?

694
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,893
Now, to capture the flag you've got to
sneak into the other guy's territory.

695
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,562
Capture his flag without getting
one of your strips taken off.

696
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,650
First guy to capture the flag wins,
and that's about it.

01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:09,345
A little girl would be so much nicer.
Don't you think so, Angela?

1024
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,723
Angela...

1025
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,767
Such a lovely name.

1026
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,061
Why, I believe it means "angel."

1027
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,230
Why, yes.
I'm sure it does.

1028
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,524
I know you're going
to like that name.

1029
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,735
Won't you, Peter?

[SNARLING]

1031
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,492
How can it be?

1032
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:33,661
[SNARLING]

1033
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,749
My God, she's a boy.
