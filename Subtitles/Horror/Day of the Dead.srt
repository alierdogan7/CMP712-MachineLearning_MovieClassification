Ouch.

00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,168
[Man]
Shit. Shit.

4
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,398
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,997
It's okay.
I have another one.

6
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,440
All right.

7
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,212
Slow down.

8
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,511
Just follow me.

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,982
[Man]
You like that?

10
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,075
[Woman]
Uh-huh.

11
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,713
Tell me you like it.

12
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,154
I just did.

13
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,091
Please don't tell me you're taking
lessons from that Neanderthal.

14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,228
No. No.

15
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,772
Good.
I want us to be special.

00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,842
Ah-choo!

[snorts]

19
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,251
That's disgusting.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,185
Hey, let's explore.

21
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,595
[woman laughs]

22
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,501

[horns honking]

24
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,246
Hey, what's the holdup?
This sucks.

25
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,409
Why is there traffic?

26
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,917
What is going on?
What is that?

27
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,385
This is crazy.

28
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,819
[radio]
A spokesman released a statement

29
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,947
ten minutes ago

30
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,789
saying that the quarantine exercise
will be for 24 hours...

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,521
[military radio]
Charlie 1-4, this is Charlie...

32
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,461
We have visual contact.

33
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,022
We got reservations at 7.
You mean to tell me we can't get through?

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,965
This is bullshit. Bullshit.

35
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,094
You can't do this.
We're in America.

36
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,071
Who gave the order
for this exercise?

37
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,471
Sir, my orders are to keep
this road sealed off

38
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,100
for the next 24 hours.

39
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,475
You can take your son
to the hospital in town.

40
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,776
Those guys don't know their asses
from a hole in the ground.

41
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,076
I want to go to a real hospital.

42
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,548
Sir, I understand.

43
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,643
Not unless you have kids,
you don't fucking understand.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,086
Honey,
you're not helping.

45
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,055
We're going to Boulder.

46
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,389
Corporal Cross? Platoon up.

47
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,328
You heard the man.
Let's go. Let's go.

48
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,558
Sir, I'm asking you politely.

49
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,431
Please turn
your car around. Please.

50
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,968
Mrs. Leitner?
What?

51
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,103
Sarah, what are you
doing here?

52
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,942
Your mom told me
you were never coming back.

53
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,711
Well, you know
how she exaggerates.

54
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,843
Besides, I'm needed here.

55
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,477
Look, I'm sorry
that I yelled,

56
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,818
but can you
get us out of here?

57
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,323
Cody is really sick.

58
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,053
Mr. Leitner, I understand
that you're upset,

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,652
but the best thing that
you can do for Cody right now

60
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,923
is to get him
to the medical center.

61
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,760
The Army's
brought in specialists.

62
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,595
They're already there
at the hospital.

63
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,761
That'll be much quicker
than driving to Boulder.

64
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,202
She's right.

65
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,466
[Sarah]
Thank you.

66
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,314
All right, get the rest
of these cars turned around.

67
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,577
[Man]
Okay, you heard the captain.

68
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,414
Let's get all of the cars turned around.

69
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,817
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,913
Sir.

71
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,424
Did I just
tell them the truth?

72
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,757
Corporal, your orders are
to keep this shit hole town--

73
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,855
Excuse me.
Your shit hole town sealed off.

74
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,092
Now do it.

75
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,566
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,728
[radio]
0616, over.

77
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,863
Yeah, where the hell
are those med 'chines?

78
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,634
They were supposed to
be here three hours ago.

79
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,936
They haven't reported in, sir.

80
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,567
We've got teams searching now.

81
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,544
No. Both of them?

82
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,586
Nina?

83
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,922
[mice squeaking]

84
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,872
Nina?

85
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,379
Hello.

86
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,545
Gotcha!
Aah!

87
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,750
I got you.

88
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,125
Not really.
Yeah, right.

89
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,028
What'd you find?

90
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,797
I don't know.

91
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,133
You want to check it out?

92
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,038
Find a cool little spot?

93
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:53,374
In a dark hole?
I don't think so.

94
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,075
Hey, didn't you
say something

95
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,947
about your mother
being sick with the flu?

96
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,418
Yeah, she's in bed.

97
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,388
You think she'd know
if we were on your couch?

98
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,957
[claps]
Zip it up, Kyle.

99
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,618
What?

100
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,525
We're out of here.
Come on.

101
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,390
I'm not really done here.

102
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,663
You want a ride? You're done.

103
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,003
Your friend's
a real buzz kill.

104
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,838
Tell me about it.

105
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,572
Oh, God.

106
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,646
Jesus, you okay, man?

107
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,019
Chill. It stopped.
Are you my mom?

108
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,922
Okay, okay, come on. We gotta go.

109
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,188
Nina and I have, you know, plans.

110
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,232
My parents aren't getting home
for a couple of hours.

111
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,531
Want to come over?

112
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,697
Are you nuts?

113
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,400
If you got me sick,
I'll kill you.

114
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,407
No.

115
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,273
Come on, Kyle!
Bus is leaving!

116
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,436
Let's go!
Wait!

117
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,377
This is KSWT,
broadcasting live

118
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,881
from downtown
Leadville, Colorado.

119
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,781
[Man]
So I have some travel news

120
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,184
for all of you trying to get out of town.

121
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,553
Route 40 will be closed
until 7:30 tomorrow night.

122
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,958
Still, they keep saying
this is just an exercise.

123
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,826
Now, Uncle Sam wouldn't be
trying to lie to us, would he?

124
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,265
No. Stay tuned for further bulletins.

125
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,896
In the meantime, when the man
gives them to me,

126
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,837
I'll give them to you.

127
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,673
And now, some more
inane bull stuff.

128
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:35,771
So, as a cog in the military
industrial complex,

129
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,315
are you capable of
independent thought?

130
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,613
Sir, my orders are to relay
the information to you

131
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,346
so you can pass it on
to the public.

132
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,820
This ain't about
that flu thing, is it?

133
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,687
So what the fuck
is it about?

134
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,358
You are gonna talk to me,
so help me God.

135
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,389
Or...Celine Dion.

136
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,302
You probably like her.

## [rock]

138
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,641
Well, hey, come on.

139
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,803
You know, it was
just my allergies.

140
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,506
Look,
I'll give you money.

141
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,605
What?

142
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,547
Well--
Fuck you.

143
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,278
I'm walking home.

144
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,721
Where'd she go?

145
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,128
She said she needed
some exercise.

146
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,298
# Everything is all right #

147
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,202
# Things can be
as they should #

148
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,137
# If you look after me #

149
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,142
# The way
I looked after you #

150
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,377
We're so over, Kyle.

151
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,282
[creaking]

152
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,841
Kyle?

[loud growl]

154
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,766
Aah!

155
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,103
[panting]

156
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,915
Whoa!

157
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,221
Aargh!

158
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,124
Aah!

00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,391
[siren]

160
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,407
Hey, Private,
why don't you be all you can be

161
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,911
and grab them damn batteries?

162
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,143
Can you believe they're
gonna give that bitch a gun?

163
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,717
Get this to Captain Rhodes
as soon as you can.

164
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,784
Corporal Cross.

165
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,228
We were given orders
to report to your squad.

166
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,435
Think I'm gonna like it here.

167
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,665
You were at Fort Bragg, right?

168
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,138
Yes.

169
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,265
Yeah, I heard about you.

170
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,173
You and my homie Henry Fat

171
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,042
was hitting it for
a couple months, right?

172
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,479
You and your homie
got your wires crossed.

173
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,481
It didn't happen.

174
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,812
If you say so.

175
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,443
As of now, you two
are on guard duty.

176
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,817
This is your barricade.

177
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,220
No one gets through.
You got that?

178
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,222
Crain, you the driver?

179
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,758
Yes, sir. Um, God.

180
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,758
Ma'am.

181
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,692
You up for a road trip?

00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,751
Yeah.

183
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,492
No one gets through.

184
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,928
How long we supposed
to stay here?

185
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,370
We'll try and be back
before breakfast.

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,169
That's, like, 12 hours!

187
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,266
We'll bring you a bagel.

188
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,437
Ahem. Are we really
spending the night together?

189
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,707
Not a chance.
Okay, good,

190
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,545
because that wouldn't be appropriate.

191
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,983
He was definitely
hitting that.

192
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,611
Shut up.

193
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,593
I-- I thought
you wanted me to drive.

194
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,130
I know the way.

195
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,756
You just join?

196
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,664
Really? You can tell?

197
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,464
Yeah, seven months ago.

198
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,163
I was studying
radar and countermeasures.

199
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,001
My first time being called out.

200
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,439
Kind of wish it was something
a little more exciting.

201
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,703
Be careful what you wish for.

202
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,802
I've seen exciting.

203
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,346
You don't have to worry.

204
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,904
Nothing really happens
in this town anyway.

205
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,644
Yeah, it seems
like a real shit hole.

206
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,319
Where are we going anyway?

207
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,048
My house.

208
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,990
Oh, so you're from here?

209
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,290
Born and raised.

210
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,798
Well, it's kind of
a charming shit hole.

211
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,609
All right, I'll be back.

212
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,274
Listen,
Crain sounds so formal.

213
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,284
What do your friends
call you?

214
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,513
Um, my friends call me Bud.

215
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,579
Bud. Okay.

216
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,024
Well, when we're not around the others,
you can call me Sarah.

217
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,055
[car door shuts]

218
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,766
Whoo.

219
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,172
## [rock]

220
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,075
Nothing on TV?

221
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,810
Sarah?

222
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,445
Haven't you heard of knocking?

223
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,921
Uh, this is
my house, too.

224
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,959
You want privacy,
find a new place.

225
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,393
What's going on, Nina?
Nothing, really.

226
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,089
Your father still
teaching Sunday school?

227
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,290
This is so not cool.

228
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,423
You know what, you missed
a button right there.

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,694
What the hell are
you doing here?

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,894
Enforcing the quarantine.

231
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,061
What's up with not
returning my calls?

232
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,468
What quarantine?
What calls?

233
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,664
You're kidding me.

234
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,639
I called your cell phone,
like, five or six times.

235
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,903
You know what?
Where's Mom?

236
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:05,966
In bed, I guess.

237
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,569
You guess.
I just got home.

238
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,635
She wasn't feeling well
this morning.

239
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:09,578
And you didn't
check on her?

240
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,615
I check on her every day.

241
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,615
That's a lot more
than some people.

242
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,276
Get over it, Trevor.

243
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,517
Hey, Mom.

244
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,186
Sarah, honey.

245
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,229
I didn't know you were coming.

246
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,490
[cough]

247
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,397
I guess you were too busy to call.

248
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,661
How are you feeling, Mom?

249
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,929
I'm okay.

250
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,630
No, you're not.
You're burning up.

251
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,673
Please, you have more
important things to do

252
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,571
than worry about me.

253
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,109
What are you doing here?

254
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,439
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

255
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,536
Don't be silly.

256
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,139
It's just a cold.
I took some vitamins.

257
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,207
Mom, I'm taking you
to the hospital, okay?

258
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,513
Let's get you dressed.

259
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,282
[panting]

260
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,721
[coughing]

261
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,188
My dad's left a dozen messages.
They're at the hospital.

262
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,388
How long has Mom been sick?

263
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,953
Since this morning.
It's a cold.

264
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,658
Everyone's got it.
And when did you start caring?

265
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,825
Don't start with me.

266
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,027
Kyle had it really bad.

267
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,467
His nose
was gushing blood.

268
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,333
Where is he now?

269
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,839
Home. He found his dad's
supply of medical hash.

270
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,308
I'm gonna run over there
and check on him.

271
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,571
Wait, wait.

272
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,135
Wait, you can't even
go upstairs

273
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,407
to check on your own mother,

274
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,847
and now you want to go
all the way across town?

275
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,715
No. You're gonna
go upstairs,

276
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,879
make sure
Mom gets dressed,

277
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,047
and don't leave
until I get back.

278
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,852
Do you think
you can handle that?

279
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,586
I'll go check on Kyle.

280
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,424
Aye-aye, Admiral Bitch.

281
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,497
Everything okay?

282
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,193
No, it's not.

283
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,765
[knocking]

284
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,445
Kyle.

285
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,106
Anybody here?

286
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,658
Oh, shit.

287
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,694
Don't worry. It's not loaded.

288
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,282
Oh, my God.

289
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,806
What the hell happened here?

290
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,944
Aah! Fuck!

291
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,611
Fuck! Uhh! Oh!

292
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,758
What's there?

293
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,462
The phone is dead.

294
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,089
Fuck.

295
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,760
Oh, God.

296
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,271
[beeping]

297
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,601
I don't have any service.

298
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,866
Yeah.
Come on.

299
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,002
Let's go.

300
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,311
Fitzsimmons,
14 Cypress Pond Road.

301
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,044
The boy Kyle is missing.

302
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,915
The bodies look like they
were mauled by something.

303
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,546
I couldn't call the police.
All the phones are dead. Over.

304
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,816
[Rhodes]
Yes, I know, Corporal.

305
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,414
We're blocking all phone lines

306
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,722
until we get control
of the situation.

307
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,558
Got a whole lot of wild
rumors running around here.

308
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,825
I'll get that info to the police.

309
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,025
Where are you?

310
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,796
I need to take my mother
to the hospital, Sir.

311
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,427
Well, I'm headed
over there right now

312
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,028
to see if I can find
some missing doctors.

313
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,801
You get back to
that roadblock ASAP.

314
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,069
Yes, sir. Over and out.

315
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,443
Why isn't your gun loaded?

316
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,581
It's complicated.

317
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,420
Cool.

318
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,583
I'm a vegetarian, by the way.

319
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,092
Maybe we should just
keep that between us.

320
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,971
Was Kyle stoned?

321
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,341
He wasn't there.

322
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,280
Did his parents
know where he was?

323
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,283
No.

324
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,910
Oh, oh. I'm bleeding.

325
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,786
There's gauze
in the kit.

326
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,346
All right.
Here, here, I got it.

327
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,356
Here,
tilt your head back.

328
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,620
Careful.
You got it?

329
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,927
So when are you
going back to Denver?

330
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,436
[coughing]

331
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,133
[siren]

332
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,869
[Sarah]
Park it and meet us inside.

333
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,274
[Bud]
Yes, Ma'am.

334
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,422
[coughing]

335
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,690
Slow down!

336
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,259
Oh!

337
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,362
Jerk!

338
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,374
Excuse me, ma'am,
my mom needs a doctor.

339
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,239
Yeah, her and everyone else.

340
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,642
Look, here.

341
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,340
Just write her name on the list,
and we'll get to her.

342
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,874
I-I can't wait.

343
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,851
Listen, lady,
half the town's sick.

344
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,443
We're overwhelmed
and understaffed.

345
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,614
Just write her name
down on the list.

346
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,816
[coughing]

347
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,822
Mom... look, they're
a bit overwhelmed, okay?

348
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,330
We're going to have to wait.

349
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,160
What?

350
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,362
Do you mind?

351
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,931
I found my mom and dad.

352
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,374
They're in a room,
waiting for the doctor.

353
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,036
You want to come with?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

354
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,273
Trevor, wait!

355
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,876
Stay here.

356
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,683
Salazar, you're supposed
to be on guard duty.

357
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,882
Williams and Elders
have it covered.

358
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,117
Captain had me
come with him.

359
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,682
You know the phone lines
are down.

360
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,818
The cell phones
aren't even working.

361
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,919
I heard it was orders
from Washington.

362
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,396
[coughing]

363
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,558
You think this is still
just an exercise?

364
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,832
Nah. There's some real
serious shit going down.

365
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,269
Corporal Cross.

366
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,907
Sir.

367
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,413
There's a doctor here
from the CDC.

368
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,181
He wants to ask you about
the bodies at Cypress Pond.

369
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,984
He was annoyingly insistent.

370
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,581
[coughing]

371
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,426
Sarah's great, huh?

372
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,527
I wish
she were around more.

373
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,040
Um, does she have
a boyfriend?

374
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,335
She's hot, huh?

375
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,178
Oh, she's so hot.

376
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,143
You think she'd ever
go out with a private?

377
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,015
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm a little bit--

378
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,387
Are you all right?

379
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,482
Oh, my God.

380
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,254
You're freezing.

381
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,852
[Man]
I need some help over here!

382
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,021
Come on, man.

383
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,928
Stay with me.
Talk to me, talk to me.

384
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,557
Talk to me,
talk to me, talk to me.

385
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,931
Um...

386
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,701
Okay, um, Mrs. Cross,

387
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,705
I'm going to go get Sarah.

388
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,001
Okay?

389
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,799
Corporal Cross!

390
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,280
It has to be airborne.

391
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,374
But once in the blood,

392
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,782
it mutates faster
than anything else--

393
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,911
Dr. Logan,
this is Corporal Cross.

394
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,615
Thanks for coming.

395
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,817
Can you give us a minute?

396
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,922
I find people
speak more freely

397
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,759
without a superior
officer around.

398
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,427
I'll be outside.

399
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,331
You've had quite a night.

400
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,434
You could say that.

401
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,001
About the bodies,

402
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,842
you said they looked
like they were mauled.

403
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,108
Could it have been
an animal attack?

404
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,151
If an animal can hide
a body in a closet.

405
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,151
The son is missing?

406
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,744
Yes.

407
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,119
Did the wounds
look like bite marks?

408
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,122
What?

409
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,659
It's a simple question.

410
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,887
How would I know?

411
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,259
Maybe it's the avian flu.

412
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,354
Don't say that.

413
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,763
Dad, seriously,
that's so not possible.

414
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,961
I heard about this case
in France where--

415
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,697
Dad?

416
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,968
Daddy, what's wrong?

417
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,968
Dad?

418
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,045
[echoing]
Daddy?

419
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,107
What's going on?

420
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,681
Daddy?

421
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,848
Dad!

422
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,558
Dad?

423
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,889
[growling]

424
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,522
Okay, we-- we really
need a doctor.

425
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,493
Aah!

426
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,332
Aah!

427
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,666
Raah!

428
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,832
Aah!

429
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,876
[crunching]

430
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,146
Sir? Sir?

431
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,185
Corporal, you gotta
come to the waiting room.

432
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,349
Something's happening.

433
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,086
To my mom?
To everybody.

434
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,492
What is it?
Something bad. I don't know.

435
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,741
[Woman]
Hey, I thought you guys left hours ago.

436
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,252
[grunting]

437
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,583
What the--

438
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,249
[screeching]

439
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,952
No! No!

440
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,322
No! Oh! Aah!

441
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,388
Aah!

442
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,402
[zombies groaning]

443
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,774
[people screaming]

444
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,785
[groaning]

445
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,682
[Man]
Oh, my God! Anybody!

446
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,353
[woman crying]
[yelling]

447
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,795
So this chick takes
her top off, right?

448
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,332
[laughs]
And I swear to God--

449
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,931
[electricity crackling]

450
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,498
What the--
[laughs]

451
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,010
Now this here's just
a little too much for this cowboy.

452
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,511
Now, you see this button here?

453
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,070
You press it, and you talk into that

454
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,740
if you've got something
to say to the folks

455
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:56,082
because my shift has now ended,
and I am going to mosey on home.

456
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,178
[woman screaming]

457
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,148
Or not.

458
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,186
[man screaming]

459
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,628
[horn honking, tires squealing]

460
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,867
[car crashes]

461
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,467
Hey, where the hell are you going?

462
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,820
Hey, I thought you said
there were two bodies.

463
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,880
Yeah.
Now there's three.

464
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,721
Show me.

465
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,059
[pounding at door]

466
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,035
Freeze!
Oh!

467
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,402
[gunshots]

468
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,557
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

469
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,154
Hey, maybe you shouldn't
go down there!

470
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,295
Huh?
[groaning]

471
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,732
Aah! Aah!

472
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,309
What the fuck?

473
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,543
[shrieking]

474
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,228
What the fuck?

475
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,561
[screaming]

476
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,169
[sirens in distance]

477
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,938
[groaning]

478
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,581
Aah! Aah!

479
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,281
Aah!

480
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,221
Aah! Aah!

481
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,383
Come on, come on,
come on.

482
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,120
[screaming]

483
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,559
Go, go, go, go.

484
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,620
God!

485
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,725
Aah!

486
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,061
Oh, my God!

487
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,904
Aah! Aah!

488
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,908
No, no, no, no!

489
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,181
No! No!

490
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,586
Here they come!

491
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,885
Aah!

492
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,290
What the fuck was that?

493
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,395
Let me in!

494
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,169
Come on. Come on.

495
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,956
What the hell?

496
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,198
What the hell is happening
to these people?

497
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,360
I don't know.

498
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,835
Where's the basement?

499
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,893
Right there.

500
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,530
My mom's in there.

501
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,596
We'll go undercover.

502
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,732
That's an order, Corporal!

503
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,053
Come on!

504
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:01,931
Here.

505
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,490
We're safe!

506
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:09,974
Grrr!

507
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,440
Aah!

508
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,340
What the hell was that?
You almost got me killed.

509
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,511
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

510
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,282
[Sarah]
Bud! Help me.

511
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,754
[knocking]

512
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,104
[horn honks]

513
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,796
Oh, my God.

514
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,741
[knocking]

515
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,475
What are we going to do?

516
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,323
Aah!
Aah!

517
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,330
Fuck!

518
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,491
[sobbing]

519
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,659
Come on.

520
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,737
Aah!

521
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,959
Look at the radio station.

522
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,001
Look, there's somebody
in there.

523
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

524
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,232
Hey.

525
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,174
We're going to make it,
okay?

526
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,938
I swear.

527
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,534
We can make Molotov cocktails.

528
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,669
Great, and I'll just build a bus
and drive us out of here.

529
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,212
Come on,
we have weapons.

530
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,611
I don't have a gun.
What?

531
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,582
I'm in communications.
We aren't issued weapons.

532
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,140
So basically you're useless.

533
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,185
Shut up, Logan.

534
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,345
Come on.
You've got one.

535
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,649
We can shoot
enough of them.

536
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,087
It's not loaded.

537
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,182
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

538
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,124
What the hell kind
of soldier are you?

539
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,719
You don't want to find out
right now, okay?

540
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,560
Bud, where did you park the Humvee?

541
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,601
The lot was full, so l--
Oh, shit.

542
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,260
They must have come out
when I was--

543
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,101
Great. A driver without keys
and a soldier without bullets.

544
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,731
It must be my fucking birthday.

545
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,275
What's with you two?

546
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,334
You know what?
It's complicated, okay, pal?

547
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,605
How did you get here?

548
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,611
Taxi.

549
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,272
Great. Well, you're nominated

550
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,374
to go out
and hail us another one.

551
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,919
Captain Rhodes' Humvee.

552
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,556
He should have the keys on him.
We've got to go get them.

553
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,326
What? No! No. No way!

554
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,628
Those things are everywhere.

555
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,500
Not everywhere.

556
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,474
Come on.

557
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,478
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

558
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,852
Hello.

559
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,914
Hello. Hello, hello, hello!

560
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:48,924
Somebody.

561
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,517
Hello! Hello?

562
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,153
Stop pounding. Look!

563
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,788
Oh, God! Oh, God!

564
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,197
Oh, God!
Shh!

565
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,393
Oh, God, I'm gonna die!

566
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,799
Open the damn door!

567
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,030
Grrr!

568
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,629
Open the door now!

569
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,799
Open up!

570
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,342
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

571
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,570
Open the door!

572
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,111
Someone help!

573
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,874
Someone open the door!

574
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,938
Oh, God! Hurry! Hurry!

575
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,687
Are you one of them?
No!

576
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,016
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

577
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,317
You better not be!

578
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,633
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner.
Oh, you're all right.

579
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,760
Where's Cody?
Is he okay? Is he--

580
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,339
We wanted to get Cody
to a doctor,

581
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,637
but your sister
wouldn't let us,

582
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,869
and now he's dead.

583
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,377
[Mrs. Leitner]
Andrew, stop it!

584
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,845
[cough]

585
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,149
My cough--
I had it before all this.

586
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,984
I'm not sick.

587
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,047
[coughing]

588
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,391
Come on.

589
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,741
[zombies growling]

590
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,879
Jesus.

591
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,223
Raah!

592
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,765
Sweet mother of God!
Don't--

593
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,634
Yuck!

594
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,066
God.

595
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,515
[Bud]
Do you want me to go?

596
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,050
Yeah. But I outrank you.

597
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,262
Okay.

598
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,441
[door opens]

599
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,222
Salazar. Are you all right?

600
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,123
Not if you keep
karate kicking me.

601
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,284
How did you get away?

602
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,389
When everybody started tripping,
I just jumped in the closet.

603
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,956
Keep laughing, bitch.

604
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,663
All right,
I'm taking Rhodes' Humvee.

605
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,204
Oh, man.

606
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,467
You won't be needing this.

607
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,810
I got 'em. Let's go.

608
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,120
Correct, my shit. Uhh!

609
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,655
Go.

610
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,369
Grrr!
No!

611
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,640
What?
What happened?

612
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,204
What is it?
Aah!

613
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,180
Give me some room! Go!

614
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,651
Come on!

615
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,119
He's got me!

616
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,212
Grrr!

617
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,050
Stop!

618
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,226
Pull!

619
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,923
Let's go! Come on!

620
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,090
Go!

621
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,628
Aah!

622
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,567
Aah!

623
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,017
Catch! Come on!

624
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,676
Pull!

625
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,516
Tell me you remembered
the keys.

626
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,108
Raah!

627
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,313
Aah! God!

628
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,418
God!

629
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,492
Ah, fuck, he got me.

630
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,121
Oh, fuck, he got me.

631
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,597
Oh, fuck, he got me.
He got me.

632
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,657
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:35,297
Aah! Aah! Aah!

634
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,240
Aah! Oh, fuck!

635
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,302
This is gonna be quick.

636
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,608
No, no!

637
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,148
You saw what happened
to Rhodes

638
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,343
when he got bit, okay?

639
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,612
This is the only way.

640
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,017
I put bleach on it.

641
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,749
[growling from above]

642
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,188
Shut up!

643
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,249
Put the gun down.
That's an order.

644
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,522
I don't know if you noticed,

645
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,826
but there's people out there
eating each other, okay?

646
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,763
So fuck you and your orders.

647
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,164
[growling from above]

648
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,601
I said shut up!

649
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,306
What are you going to do?
You going to shoot me?

650
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,672
Hey, look, Rhodes was bitten
hundreds of times, him once.

651
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,973
Besides, bleach kills
just about everything.

652
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,307
Who the fuck are you?

653
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,712
Look, I'm a doctor, okay?
I know exactly what's--

654
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,343
Man, ain't nobody trying
to hear that CSI bullshit.

655
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,319
He gotta go.

656
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,287
[growling from above]

657
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,984
Didn't I say
shut the fuck up?

658
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,391
Sir.

659
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,695
Look, I will take responsibility for him.

660
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:40,669
And if the time comes, I'll
do what has to be done, okay?

661
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,365
So just back down!

662
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,410
Look, I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

663
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,011
We need to figure out
how to get the fuck out of here.

664
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,214
I'm watching.

665
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,917
My eye's on you!

666
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,901
Call the police, the National Guard,

667
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,965
and if by any slim chance
the fucking FCC are listening,

668
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,340
they might take notice.

669
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,141
[coughing]

670
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,206
I gotta take a break.

671
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,514
This fucking blood
pressure's killing me.

672
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,556
I shouldn't have done
that kumquat diet.

673
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,456
It's probably too late
to stop smoking.

674
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,397
I'm the one who should be worried.

675
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,400
Your wife's been hacking up
a storm since you got here.

676
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,560
What are you trying to say?

677
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,762
Can I give this a try?

678
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,065
Hey, you got a license?

679
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,332
No.

680
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,395
Me, neither.

681
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,341
I ain't got a fucking license.

682
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,653
If anyone's there--

683
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,915
You go, kid.

684
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,457
If anyone can hear this,
we are trapped at the radio station

685
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,154
KXWT on Elm Street
in Leadville, Colorado.

686
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:15,096
Uh, uh, we are under attack.
Repeat. We are under attack.

687
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,065
If anyone is there at all--

688
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,396
[growling, moaning]

689
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,029
... we need help. Okay?
Something 's happening.

690
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,936
People are going out of their minds.

691
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,907
Please, please,
please, send help.

692
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,067
There's five of us here.

693
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,077
It's me, my girlfriend Nina,

694
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,737
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, and the DJ.

695
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,974
Just somebody
send something, okay?

696
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,348
We're at the radio station
KXWT on Elm Street.

697
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:40,186
Oh, oh, and if you hear my voice,
do not go to the Pine Valley Hospital.

698
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,485
Okay? It's not safe there.

699
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,119
Repeat. Do not go to the hospital.

700
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,200
[Sarah]
We should go now.

701
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,694
Okay.

702
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,262
Take this and give me
one of your guns.

703
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,535
What, you little
Miss MacGyver now?

704
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,372
That shit ain't gonna work.

705
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,747
Give me one of your guns.

706
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:05,907
If something happens to you,

707
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,245
we can't risk
losing both of them.

708
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,957
I know how to shoot
one of those.

709
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,015
I bet you do.

710
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,551
Sweet spear.

711
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,956
You see a black man
with a sharp stick

712
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,056
and it's supposed
to be a spear?

713
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,623
Oh, no,
that's not what l--

714
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,535
Bud, can you throw this
chair through the window?

715
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,038
Yeah.

716
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,698
Do you have your lighter?
Yeah.

717
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,073
Let's do this.
Are you ready?

718
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,339
Yeah.

719
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,711
Okay...Now!

720
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,297
You gotta shoot them
in the head.

721
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,598
Raah!

722
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,638
Oh, my God!

723
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:10,602
Jesus!

724
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,543
Oh, my God.

725
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,387
Let's go, Doc!

726
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,686
Watch out!

727
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,895
Shit!

728
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,571
Watch out!

729
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,650
[Sarah]
Oh, shit.

730
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,453
Let's go.

731
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,264
Please help me.

732
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,998
I'll help you.

733
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,973
Aah!

734
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,749
Come on, y'all!

735
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,608
I got him!

736
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,854
I'm out.

737
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,050
Me, too. Shit.

738
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,094
Where's Logan?

739
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,095
[car engine starts]

740
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,859
[woman screams]

741
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,830
What a dick.

742
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,373
There's more of
these motherfuckers?

743
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,876
Light 'em.

744
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,580
Come on.

745
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,707
Okay.

746
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,784
Oh, shit!

747
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,265
That worked.

748
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,537
Yeah.

749
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,082
Behind you!

750
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,688
Nice shot.

751
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,629
It was kinda gangsta, huh?

752
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,104
We gotta get some more ammo.

753
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,072
Hang on.

754
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,322
This is bullshit.

755
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,311
Hey, yo, Gomer.

756
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,350
Don't give up, man.

757
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,649
Yeah, I won't.

758
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,191
Shit!

759
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,759
What you dodging them for?
Run their ass over.

760
00:48:58,835 --> 00:48:59,767
They're still somebody.

761
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,736
Not anymore.

762
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,173
That was kinda fun.

763
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,274
That is unbelievable.

764
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,784
We have
to get out of here.

765
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,046
Do you have a car?

766
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,417
No, I ain't going out there.

767
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,752
Hey, dude, if you're feeling lucky,
you go for it.

768
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,655
I'd be like prime rib
to those fuckers.

769
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,591
I'm sitting my fat ass right here
till the help comes.

770
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,492
Let's just wait.
Somebody will come.

771
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,224
They have to.

772
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,959
[door creaks]

773
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,548
So which one of you
had the nosebleed?

774
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,312
What?
You heard her.

775
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,512
Anybody have a nosebleed?

776
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,886
Just sit down and
answer the question.

777
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,254
What is wrong with you?

778
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,623
Nina, put that down.
What are you doing?

779
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,161
Everyone who changed
had a nosebleed.

780
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,196
Who's lying?

781
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,423
Had to be one of them.

782
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,762
I said sit down.

783
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,631
Hey, you don't wanna eat this.
Major indigestion.

784
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,728
She hasn't had a nosebleed,
and neither have l.

785
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,102
Look at them.
They're covered in blood.

786
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,572
Shut up!

787
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:45,630
My son attacked a nurse.

788
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,108
It's her blood!

789
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,269
Hey, check them
for bite marks.

790
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,312
No one's touching my wife.

791
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:50,346
Just answer
the fucking question!

792
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,541
Don't you get it?

793
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,675
Someone in here is infected.

794
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,652
We're all in danger.

795
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,692
[Sarah]
All right. Let's make this quick.

796
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,532
What about
your boy back here?

797
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,040
Bud, I'm sorry.

798
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,668
No, no. I understand.

799
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,413
You all right?

800
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,247
Yeah.

801
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,308
Do me a favor.

802
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,979
Yeah. Anything.

803
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:37,789
Grab me a gun, too,
and, um, load mine.

804
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,606
Yeah, that's the type of
shit I'm talking about.

805
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,981
Ooh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

806
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,732
Fucking tell us.

807
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,831
Yeah. Now, just--

808
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,932
Ah...

809
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,536
choo!

810
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,614
Oh, God.

811
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,513
You scared me.

812
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,449
Paul?

813
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,815
Get off the couch!

814
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,769
Okay.

815
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,862
Is anyone alive out there?

816
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,873
Can anyone hear me?
Anyone? Anyone?

817
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,239
The police? Someone?
We just need someone.

818
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,504
Something's fucking happened.

819
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,546
We need someone. Please, anyone.

820
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,713
Don't think they know
who they fucking with.

821
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,513
Automatics
have no firepower.

822
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:13,044
Oh, yeah? Says who?

823
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,755
This shit right here
was made for me.

824
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,195
Uh-huh. Whoo.

825
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,927
By the power of Grayskull.

826
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,060
Okay.
Yeah.

827
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,069
Stop fucking around

828
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,070
and start loading
the stuff up.

829
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,902
How long you gonna
keep cussing at me?

830
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,340
You see this? This is a machete.

831
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,471
Unappreciative ass.
See if I save your ass again.

832
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,183
Oh, shit.

833
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,816
No! He's restrained.

834
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,916
What if he gets loose?

835
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,862
Then I'll shoot him.

836
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,363
Look, I'm not riding
with this motherfucker.

837
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,230
Yes!
Shut the fuck up!

838
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,131
My, God, he listened.

839
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,659
[Radio]
Sales of new homes rose--

840
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,821
Plus, with pop--

841
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,057
Ever since day one--

842
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,156
I don't understand.

843
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,224
They're not saying
anything about this.

844
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,633
Word hasn't gotten out yet.

845
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,931
... the Army, the National Guard,

846
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,529
anyone with weapons...

847
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,538
Oh, my God.

848
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,801
Is anyone still alive?

849
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,911
What the hell are you doing?

850
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:46,078
Out of town
is the other way.

851
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,251
That's my brother.

852
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,719
Your brother's a DJ?

853
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,586
Just send someone.
We're being attacked.

854
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,889
We need help.
We need help now.

855
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,521
Damn it, where the fuck
is the cavalry?

856
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,428
What are you doing?

857
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,759
Oh, my God. Mom!

858
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,737
Trevor!
I have to let her in!

859
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,034
Trevor, wait!

860
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,421
Oh, shit!

861
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,793
That's what I'm talking about!

862
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,090
Run their ass over!

863
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,994
Now you're driving.

864
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,328
Wait! Wait!

865
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,997
She could be infected!
No!

866
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,199
Why'd you lie
about the nosebleed?

867
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,142
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

868
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,702
I promise.

869
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,712

Trevor, it wasn't her.

875
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,165
Not anymore.

00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,735
Nina, is there
anybody else up there?

877
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:17,932
Yes.

878
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,565
Bring them down.
We're getting out of here.

879
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,574
We are?

880
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:22,304
Go!

881
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,539
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,249
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner,
we've been rescued. Come on.

883
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,053
It's time to go.

885
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:51,139
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner?

886
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,232
No!

887
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,528
Raah!
Aah!

888
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,574
Trevor, I'm sorry.

889
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,044
Yo, survivors.

890
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,446
Hello!

891
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,150
[Salazar]
Come on.

892
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,120
It's soldiers. Come on!

893
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,487
Aah!

894
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,307
Nina! Hey!

895
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,054
Quick, get over here.

896
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,556
Come on, man.
They're coming, man.

897
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,751
Hurry up. They're coming!

898
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:20,159
Aah! Oh, no! Oh, no!

899
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,787
We need to leave.

900
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,382
[zombies moaning]

901
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,078
Let's go!

902
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,138
This shit is ridiculous.

903
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,334
I mean, why Thriller over here
ain't trying to eat us?

904
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,604
He's a vegetarian.

905
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,338
That's the best explanation
you can come up with?

906
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,543
You got a better one?

907
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,178
All I'm saying, as long
as he don't try to mistake me

908
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,814
for a soybean burger,
we gonna be all right.

909
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,457
They seem to retain
some part of themselves

910
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,327
before they were infected.

911
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,559
Must've retained his hormones

912
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,567
because he definitely
remembers who you are.

913
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,873
Guess that also means
he remembers who was boss,

914
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,636
huh, bitch?
[groans]

915
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,371
Bad soldier.

916
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:43,810
Ten hut!

917
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,646
That's some crazy-ass shit.

918
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,232
Williams,
Captain Rhodes is down.

919
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,031
Do you have any idea
where--

920
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,004
[screaming, shouting]

921
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,251
Check if the SATCOM's working.

922
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,385
[shouting]

923
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,562
Come on. Let's go!

924
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,103
Let's get out of here!

925
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,237
Whoo!

926
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,103
Them fools were shooting at me!

927
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,806
What we taking,
a back road out of here?

928
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:28,145
There is no back road.

929
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,048
Sarah, go up
Hidden Lake Road.

930
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,711
We could get to Boulder
on the fire road.

931
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,552
Yeah, you're right.
Good thinking.

932
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,220
Okay, hold on.

933
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,222
Hey.

934
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,489
You okay?

935
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,024
Remember I said
we're gonna make it?

936
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,330
We are.

937
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,338
[sighs]

938
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,400
Never going back, are we?

939
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:32,346
I don't know, Trevor.

940
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,680
You know, why did you
leave in the first place

941
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,844
instead of opening
the bike shop?

942
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,409
You think I was gonna
wait around for you

943
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,978
to get your shit together?
Who built the first bike?

944
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:41,580
That broke
and almost killed me

945
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,682
when we were, like,
50 miles from home?

946
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,558
Could y'all save that shit
for Oprah, please?

947
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,392
[hiss]

948
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,091
What the fuck was that?

949
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,165
Kyle.

950
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,272
[hissing, shouting]

951
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,024
Come on, get out!

952
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,367
What's happening, player?

953
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,532
[groans]

954
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:33,802
At ease, soldier.

955
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:43,514
All right.

956
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,417
Kyle.

957
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,059
Is there any reason
why we're keeping this bitch around?

958
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,722
Everyone grab as much
firepower as you can.

959
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,287
Look at that shit.

960
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,299
He likes you.

961
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,301
Got a little zombie crush.

962
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:03,270
We need to find cover,
some place we an defend.

963
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,863
The old Nike site's
about a mile from here.

964
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,273
Yeah, you're right,
we can hole up there,

965
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,708
wait for daylight.
Good call.

966
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,246
All right, we're gonna
keep Bud with us.

967
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,542
Why?

968
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,014
He might be useful
against them.

969
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,176
And he follows orders.
I like that.

970
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,379
But if he tries anything...

971
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,150
Head shot.

972
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,818
Yeah, come on,
Mr. Follows Orders.

973
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,121
About face!

974
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,723
Oh, my--

975
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,630
Forward march!

976
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,507
[growling]

977
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,940
What was that?

978
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,672
I don't know,
but be ready for anything.

979
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,714
Let's move out!

980
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,534
Come on, let's go.

981
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,211
Have a seat.

982
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,305
[door closes]

983
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,514
What the hell
you looking at?

984
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,416
I know you're not
looking at her ass.

985
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,390
I think ol' Gomer
over here wants--

986
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,390
Grrr!

987
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,950
Salazar,
leave him alone!

988
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,291
Trevor.

989
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,295
Good idea.

990
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,956
I'll lead with this.

991
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,126
Don't count on me.

992
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,897
Look, you wanna drop
the passive aggressive bullshit

993
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,632
for once, please?

994
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,300
Over some bicycles?
What's with you two?

995
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,536
It's complicated.

996
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,875
He's a kid.

997
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,710
Yeah, but we all have
to grow up sometime.

998
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,215
Now would be nice.

999
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,511
[groaning, moaning]

1000
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,142
[screaming]

1001
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,210
Bud! Bud! Stop it!

1002
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,755
[screaming]

1003
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,815
Bud! Bud, stop it!

1004
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,360
[screaming]

1005
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,501
Aah!

1006
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,765
Let's go!

1007
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,537
Hey! Follow me!

1008
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:42,829
This way!

1009
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,024
Let's go!

1010
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,765
Whoa.

1011
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,118
Hey, guys.

1012
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:12,189
Come on!
Cover him!

1013
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,432
Nice shot.

1014
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,535
Thanks.

1015
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,441
Hey, come on.

1016
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,990
[Salazar]
What the hell?

1017
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,859
A Puffy video.

1018
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,043
Of course.
[crash]

1019
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,275
Yo, we got company.

1020
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,714
Trevor, you loaded?

1021
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,513
Full up.

1022
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,918
All right, stay here with Nina, okay?
We'll be back.

1023
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,715
Wait, please don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1024
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,683
The fuck are you doing here?

1025
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,118
I-- I was trying to get away.

1026
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,678
Those things were after me.

1027
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,690
I found this compound.
I just came here for shelter.

1028
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,589
So you took off
to save your own ass?

1029
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,786
No.

1030
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,089
And destroy some kind
of evidence, huh?

1031
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,294
Says something
about Project Wildfire.

1032
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,598
Your name's on every one of them.

1033
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,137
What is
Project Wildfire?

1034
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,433
I don't know how my name--

1035
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,269
Listen to me!
My mom's dead.

1036
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,139
My hometown's turned into
a fucking slaughterhouse.

1037
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,542
You either tell me
what you know,

1038
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:45,671
or so help me, I will
shoot you dead right here.

1039
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,773
Look, if you'll just
give me a second to explain--

1040
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,579
[chambers round]

1041
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:50,914
Don't lie to her.

1042
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:51,975
If you'll let me finish--

1043
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,079
Go ahead.

1044
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,158
There were a few select scientists
studying certain biochemical agents.

1045
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,717
Including you?

1046
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,195
Were you studying them
or creating them?

1047
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,825
Look, I was in Washington
to give a report.

1048
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,630
I couldn't reach anyone here.

1049
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,695
Then I heard about the quarantine.

1050
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,765
Look, we don't know our
research has anything to do

1051
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:14,968
with this outbreak.

1052
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,739
Yes, we do.

1053
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:23,580
Ahem.

1054
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,017
The virus--

1055
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,054
It was three days ago.

1056
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:28,589
...has mutated, and somehow

1057
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,592
we have all become
infected or eaten,

1058
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,127
and I'm the last.

1059
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,685
I think I've killed them all:

1060
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:38,563
Tom, Grace, and everyone.

1061
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:41,296
I, uh...[gagging]

1062
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,168
have sealed myself
inside this bunker.

1063
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,505
I've destroyed the samples
and archived my notes.

1064
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,034
And I don 't know why the infection
is moving so slowly,

1065
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,206
but I can feel it.

1066
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,716
I can feel the malevolence.

1067
01:10:55,784 --> 01:11:00,380
I'll die here like the pharaohs

1068
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:04,392
with my legacy,
a beautiful weapon...

1069
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,520
beautiful weapon.

1070
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,003
What was this virus
supposed to do?

1071
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,804
It was designed
to paralyze enemy troops

1072
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,242
by shutting down
their neural system

1073
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,371
for six to seven hours.

1074
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,914
We didn't think
it would mutate.

1075
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:28,313
Come on,
this would have allowed us

1076
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,249
to capture people
without killing them.

1077
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,718
It was intended to save lives.

1078
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,584
Yeah,
hell of a job, Doc.

1079
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,118
He got out.

1080
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,422
Yeah, the door was open
when Nina and I got here.

1081
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,452
Why aren't we all sick?

1082
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,465
Some people have
a natural immunity

1083
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,500
to specific viruses.

1084
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,831
Lucky us.

1085
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,598
But from what l
understand,

1086
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,367
once bitten,
there's no protection.

1087
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,271
Whatever, man.
Where's the back door?

1088
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,502
There isn't one.

1089
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:55,770
[distant growling]

1090
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,421
Oh, shit.

1091
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,501
Stay here.

1092
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,040
You back?

1093
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,200
I'm not going to
die down here,

1094
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:31,406
but you,
you knew about this.

1095
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,004
No, I didn't know.
I swear.

1096
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:36,245
Nina, Nina, no.
He's not worth it.

1097
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,389
He's smarter than the others.

1098
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:47,995
Don't believe this shit.

1099
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,759
I'm not going back
into that airshaft.

1100
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,391
Raah!

1101
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,301
Shut up, bitch.

1102
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,203
Hey, did you guys get him?

1103
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,371
He's in the ventilation system.

1104
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,142
Yeah, I got his little girlfriend, though.

1105
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,707
[clanking, groaning]

1106
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,613
That's Dr. Engel.

1107
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,386
He was the best man
on the team.

1108
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,360
If they do retain
something of what they were,

1109
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,227
we are so screwed.

1110
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:24,856
We have to find a way out.

1111
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:25,991
That's the only way out.

1112
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,330
That's why
we chose this place.

1113
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,394
Man, I thought scientists
were supposed to be smart.

1114
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,905
Here, follow me.

1115
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:32,998
Dumb asshole.

1116
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,508
This place
is a Nike site, right?

1117
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,804
Yeah.

1118
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,778
Well, they weren't making
sneakers up in here.

1119
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:40,246
Nike sites were built
during the Cold War

1120
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,249
to house missiles.

1121
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,682
What?

1122
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,846
What, you were smoking weed
during history class?

1123
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:51,222
Anyways, there were missiles,
and there had to be missile silos.

1124
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:55,024
We find one of those,
and we'll have our escape route.

1125
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:01,532
Hey, what happened
to Fuck-Face?

1126
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,400
[gasps]

1127
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,099
Oh, Jesus.

1128
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,836
[groaning]

1129
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,746
We have to find
that silo.

1130
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,130
It's going to take forever
to search all these hallways.

1131
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,103
We've got to split up.

1132
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,264
We meet back here
in five minutes.

1133
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,207
Why do white people
always want to split up?

1134
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,504
I'm not doing it.

1135
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,773
He's right.

1136
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:46,508
Whatever. It's y'all's funeral.
Who is going with who?

1137
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:47,514
Trevor, you're gonna
go with me.

1138
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:50,916
No. Trevor and l
stick together.

1139
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,147
We'll be okay.

1140
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:54,951
All right. Five minutes.

1141
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,149
Not a second longer.

1142
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,159
Be careful.

1143
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,335
You look hot.

1144
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,535
Shut the fuck up.

1145
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,876
Lucky somebody paid attention
during history class.

1146
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,648
Yeah, you're not
as dumb as you look.

1147
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,280
Oh, yeah?

1148
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,155
Well, you're not
as annoying as you look.

1149
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:41,029
Just in case.

1150
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,367
Go!

1151
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,200
Sarah, run!

1152
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,816
[Salazar screams]

1153
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:39,419
Are you all right?

1154
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,190
Yeah. Salazar?

1155
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,423
Great.

1156
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,063
Holy shit.
What?

1157
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,105
It's missile propulsion tanks.

1158
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,197
Are you sure?

1159
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,536
Yeah.

1160
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,975
We can rig these
like giant flamethrowers,

1161
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,477
get all those things
in one place,

1162
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,377
and just blast
the shit out of them.

1163
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,847
All right.

1164
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,374
As soon as Nina knocks
the nozzles off the tanks,

1165
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,911
all I have to do is--

1166
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,054
Are you all right?

1167
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,118
It's fine.

1168
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,569
All right, I'm going
to be running like hell.

1169
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,939
As soon as I clear,
you fire the tanks, okay?

1170
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,136
Got it.

1171
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,473
And don't worry,
it's going to work.

1172
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,343
I know.

1173
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,347
Hey, Sarah?

1174
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,111
Yeah?

1175
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:37,446
Don't get eaten.

1176
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,101
[growling]

1177
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,327
Hey!

1178
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,159
[screaming]

1179
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,406
Now!

1180
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:37,431
[Sarah]
See if Logan left the keys.

1181
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,850
[Radio]
An update on the outbreak
in Leadville, Colorado.

1182
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:58,442
We're getting sketchy reports

1183
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,488
that bodies are still being discovered,

1184
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,524
but a spokesman
for the military has assured us

1185
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,356
that the flu-like virus
has been fully contained.

1186
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,293
So while travel to and from the area

1187
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:10,729
won 't be fully restored
for several days,

1188
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:13,359
it looks like the danger is over.

1189
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:17,303
This is Haley Schue reporting
for KDSX, Colorado County.

1190
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,498
Aah!

1191
01:22:18,499 --> 01:22:19,499
