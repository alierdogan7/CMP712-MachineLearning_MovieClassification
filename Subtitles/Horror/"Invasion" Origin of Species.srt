Synced : panost

4
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,935
You remember how to get there ?

5
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,909
Yep, route 27, 20 miles north.

6
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,086
Boca chica motel.

7
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,222
Yeah, the road's still blocked,
but I got you clearance.

8
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:38,941
I'll try to get up there
as soon as I can.

9
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,420
I won't count on it.

10
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,399
Hey, come on, it was my idea.

11
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,469
It's okay, honey.

12
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,180
Just find out what was inside that alligator,

13
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:47,788
and then come meet us when you can.

14
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:50,712
A little solo stepmother time
might be good for everybody.

15
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:52,320
Okay.

16
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,721
Hey, daddy, does the hotel
have a pool?

17
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,756
They got a big pool,

18
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:58,651
and they got cinnamon pancakes
the size of Jesse's head.

19
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,077
Oh, wow.

20
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,429
How come you're not goin'?

21
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:05,702
I got some work to do, but I'll try to meet up
with you guys tonight.

22
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,212
- Do you wanna drive?
- Yes.

23
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,183
Go for it.

24
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,314
All right.

25
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:16,916
When I get back, I want answers to all
the secrets of the universe.

26
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,103
Well, I'll try and have one.

27
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,149
- Take care of our baby.
- I will.

28
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,825
- Bye.
- Bye.

29
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,807
- You have fun, kids.
- Okay.

30
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:28,220
- Is this on tight?
- Seat belts?

31
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:29,710
- Okay.
- Bye, dad.

32
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,197
See ya later.

33
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:43,459
Dave, I'm goin' into work early.

34
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:44,947
Listen, I need you to promise me

35
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:47,460
you're not gonna say anything
about what we found until I...

36
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,417
Dave.

37
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,082
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

38
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,453
<i>I hope you're all sittin' down
right now,</i>

39
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:32,699
<i>because I have got some major news.</i>

40
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,764

41
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,943
<i>That's right, bloggers.</i>

42
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,677

00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:40,810

00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,261

47
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,502
That son of a bitch.

48
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:50,730
Okay, okay.

49
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,817
Okay, all right, easy.

50
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,273
Who the hell are you?

51
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:07,309
Ah. Okay.

52
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,249
No, don't.

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,371
Please, please, please.

54
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:59,106
Will you please just tell me what's going on here?

55
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,080
Your dream has come true, Dave.

56
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:03,858
You've been abducted.

57
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,322
You can't leave people in the dark.

58
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:17,098
Listen, if we don't get power back
in this town soon,

59
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:19,042
they're gonna burn my house down, Howard...

60
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:20,658
Don't let me down.

61
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:22,075
Good morning, Sir.

62
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,090
Ah, good morning to you,too, Lewis.

63
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:27,242
You're in early this morning.

64
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:29,363
- Yeah, a little work out.
- Good for you, Sir.

65
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,586
- And how's mrs. Underlay feeling today?

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,471
- Much better.

67
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,209
- Thanks for asking.
- Good.

68
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:41,306
Oh, I got an I.D. on that body we dredged up
the other night.

69
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,393
Oh, yeah?

70
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:44,648
Yeah.

71
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:47,508
Brandi Marie Kotner.
32 years old,

72
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,453
resident of florida city.

73
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:51,850
That was very enterprising of you, Lewis.

74
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:54,573
I'm trying to figure out
what she was doin' in that cove, sir.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,978
I believe  she was drowning.

76
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,461
But that's just it.
The coroner's report

77
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,650
says that she had sea water in her lungs,

78
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,426
- Not brackish.
- So?

79
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:07,930
So I'm thinkin' she died elsewhere,
and somebody moved the body.

80
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,633
You think she was murdered?

81
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,341
N-no, sir. There's no evidence of foul play.

82
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,464
Then why would someone move

83
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,631
a dead hurricane victim from one place to another?

84
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,929
- It's a puzzler, sir.
- Yes, it is,but then again...

85
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:25,815
Sir?

86
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,178
Hurricanes have been known
to move a lot of things.

87
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,582
I'll tell my wife you asked about her.

88
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:42,256
We're doing the right thing.

89
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,386
We're gonna have to go find someone else
if it's not him.

90
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,126
- Give me a little bit of time.
- No, no, no.

91
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,981
We need to find out if his blood test is...

92
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:51,569
I'll do my best. I need at least an hour.

93
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:53,438
An hour? I don't know if we have an hour.

94
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,145
His family's gonna start
lookin' for him very soon.

95
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,697
- We don't have all the materials.
- I'll give you as much time as I can.

96
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:59,038
Go ahead and do what you have to do.

97
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,413
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:17,470
Who are you?

99
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,886
If you're offering that to me,
I'm not thirsty.

100
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,206
What does that mean?

101
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,908
Why won't you talk to me?

102
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,019
I just want you to talk to me.

103
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,131
I just need to know what's goin' on, that's all.

104
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,580
- Get up.
- Why?

105
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:14,180
We're moving.

106
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:46,309
What the hell is wrong with you?

107
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,087
You run now, you'll never know the truth.

108
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:03,218
What truth?

109
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:04,780
We've been readin' your blogs, Dave.

110
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,654
We understand you had an encounter with something
that may not be of this world.

111
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:13,875
Me, too.

112
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,170
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:42,960
Lookin' for my brother-in-law Dave Groves.

114
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,180
Oh, crazy Dave?

115
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:47,946
- Yeah. I guess he comes in here a lot.
-Yeah, he's not in here now.

116
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,339
- Was he in here this morning?
- Nope.

117
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,674
- What time are you guys open?
- Uh, 5 A.M.

118
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,196
And you're sure he wasn't in here this morning?

119
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,273
Positive, but you're the second person
in as many days that's asked about him.

120
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:03,785
Who was the first?

121
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,231
Uh, the Iraqi woman.

122
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,412
What Iraqi woman?

123
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:09,240
I don't know her name.
She's Iraqi...

124
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,398
or Arab or Persian or somethin'.

125
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:12,847
Been talkin' him up about some old naval yard

126
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:15,992
from the civil war.

127
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,661
- Cold war.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

128
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,757
I think she really wanted to take him up there.

129
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:22,624
He didn't seem that interested.

130
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:28,183
Did you know that our whole town
has been invaded by ebays?

131
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,520
Your scars look  lot different than mine.

132
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:39,341
- Mine are older.
- How old?

133
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,824
Two years.

134
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,481
Those things have been out in the water for two years?

135
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:45,620
Not here.

136
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:51,182
Why don't you sit down?

137
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:54,732
Don't worry, the tests are over.

138
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:57,858
Tests?

139
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:58,475
I'm sorry, Dave.

140
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,568
We had to find out
if you were really who you said you were.

141
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:02,812
Hold on, hold on,hold on.

142
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:06,099
- Are you sure you don't want some?
- Yeah, no, I mean...

143
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:10,298
Do you have any beer?

144
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,776
No. Please sit.

145
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,890
Why'd you take my blood?
Why'd you put me under water?

146
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,064
On one of your blogs,

147
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:27,031
you wrote about
a hurricane survivors' meeting in a local church.

148
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,079
Yeah. I went to a couple of 'em.
I scoped 'em out.

149
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:30,940
Why?

150
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,368
Well, because a lot of people in this town

151
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:37,388
have been actin' pretty weird since the hurricane.

152
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:40,224
- This guy that Russell was working with--
- Russell's your brother-in-law.

153
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,245
- How did you know that?
- You've written about him.

154
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:43,845
I know about your whole family.

155
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,363
- I didn't get your name.
- Healy.

156
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:50,809
- Healy.
- Right.

157
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:52,694
- Is that your real name?
- No.

158
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,764
Right. Not like I haven't asked you
this about 1,000 times,

159
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,136
but what the hell is going on here?

160
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:59,072
- We were hopin' you could tell us.
- You first.

161
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,108
- Who's that chick who was in the back of the room?
- You'll meet her.

162
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:04,427
- You always kidnap people off the net?
- No, and I'm sorry we had to do it this way,

163
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:06,227
- No, and I'm sorry we had to do it this way,

164
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:09,036
but based on your last message, we felt that
there was some urgency.

165
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:11,851
What was my last message?

166
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,592
"Hey, bloggers, it's me again, Dave.

167
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,716
"I'm on the verge of being able to report

168
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:25,762
"that the lights in the water
may contain human D.N.A.

169
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:30,067
"Oops. Guess I just reported it."

170
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:34,393
This alligator you found
with the partially digested alien in its belly,

171
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:37,136
that was from a dying part of the glades?

172
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,260
Yeah, Russell's not even certain
that it is an alien.

173
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,607
But again, I'm available via e-mail.

174
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:46,101
I didn't need in the middle of the night
and have my head shoved...

175
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:48,504
- into a vat of water.

176
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,097
- Pria !

177
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,240
We need you now.

178
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,088
Connie?

179
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:11,111
- You took this statement?

180
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,596
Sir, I just talked to the victim's parents.

181
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,587
What victim?

182
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,300
Brandi Marie Kotner...

183
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:20,577
the girl we pulled from the water
a couple nights ago.

184
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,766
Oh. I thought she didn't have any family.

185
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,736
The coroner thought so, too,
but I did a little research,

186
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,801
and apparently, she was adopted,

187
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,592
and though her adoptive parents have passed on,

188
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:39,913
her real parents, her birth parents
are still very much alive.

189
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:43,645
Lewis, why did you do this?

190
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,938
Because I felt so badly for what happened to her...

191
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,565
and to die in such a terrible way...

192
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:56,565
And have no one there for--
Well, I prayed on it last night, Sir.

193
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:57,666
You--you prayed on it?

194
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,247
I pray about a lot of things, Sir,

195
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,912
and like me, these people were curious

196
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:04,885
how sea water managed to get into
their daughter's lungs.

197
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,175
Your wife was confused about it, too.

198
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,165
You talked to Mariel?

199
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:12,173
Well, she was the one who originally
discovered the body.

200
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:16,591
Come here.

201
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,653
This is not a good thing you've done, Lewis.

202
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:33,454
Why not?

203
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,739
Because you've gone into people's lives--

204
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,648
perfectly happy people's lives--

205
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,383
and brought them tragedy.

206
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:41,095
- But, Sir, I--
- and on top of that,

207
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:43,685
you did it without talking to me.

208
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,447
How many jobs were available to you
after your tour of duty?

209
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,540
How many sheriff's departments
wanted to hire you?

210
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:57,550
None, Sir, only you.

211
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,193
And why do you think that is?

212
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:04,003
- I don't know.
- Because I knew you'd be loyal.

213
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:09,447
- I was counting on your loyalty, Lewis.
- And you have it, Sir...

214
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,532
but I'm loyal to someone else first.

215
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:17,368
Who?

216
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,425
God, Sir.

217
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:33,299
Give me the family's phone number,
and I'll talk to them.

218
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,353
- Thank you,Sir.
- Meantime...

219
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:37,384
You know that in let over on Biscayne

220
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,550
where the kids like to party?

221
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,090
One of the sugar companies
may be dumping out there again.

222
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,032
I want you to meet  me down there tonight.

223
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:48,389
- We'll see what we see.
- I'll be there, Sir.

224
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,712
Why did he call you Pria?

225
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:45,067
- Because that's my name.
- Your real name?

226
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:48,076
- No.
- No.

227
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:49,563
What is with you people?

228
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,429
We have to be careful, Dave.

229
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:54,554
- You should be, too.
- Oh, come on, come on.

230
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,867
You've been buggin' me around
that coffee shop for weeks now,

231
00:16:58,214 --> 00:17:00,039
spinnin' me your stupid
little conspiracy theories,

232
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,665
tryin' to drag me out to some cock amamy naval yard.

233
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,086
I still need more time.

234
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:10,778
Time for what, huh?

235
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:14,102
- Who are you?
- We're survivors like you.

236
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,749
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not a survivor.

237
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,417
I spent the entire night of the hurricane
huddled in my sister's bathroom.

238
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:19,748
I never went near the water.

239
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,836
And I told your buddy here
that I only went to that church

240
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:24,091
- to check things out.
- And?

241
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:27,520
I don't know. They seemed
pretty normal to me...

242
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,052
but then I guess, you can't really trust anybody,
can you, Connie?

243
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,397
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit down.

244
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,805
As a matter of fact, I wanna leave.

245
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:40,178
That's what I'm gonna do.

246
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:43,374
I-if you leave now,
everyone you care about may die.

247
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:49,699
- Is that the truth you were talkin' about?
- Yes.

248
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,304
Then both of you need to stops
peakin' in Yoda right now...

249
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:58,389
and tell me everything you know,
or I'm outta here.

250
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:04,395
I think you should hang around.

251
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:06,972
How'd you find me?

252
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:09,242
I followed your mouth.
Who are you?

253
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,816
He says he's Healy.
She says her name's Pria,

254
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:14,282
- but yesterday, she was Connie, so...
- Put down the gun.

255
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,740
Also, he's got scars all over his body
just like Paxton

256
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,331
like the ones on my legs.

257
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,092
See if they're armed.

258
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:24,111
Okay.

259
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,241
All right. I think we're okay.

260
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:41,980
Sit down.

261
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:52,113
Why'd you bring him here?

262
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,249
We wanted a safe place where we could talk.

263
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,835
- They were readin' my blogs.
- We wanted to know who he was...

264
00:18:57,449 --> 00:19:00,568
- and what he was.
- "What he was"?

265
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:03,122
Your brother-in-law has noticed
a lot of changes

266
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,242
in people around town lately, Russell.
Haven't you?

267
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:07,813
Your ex-wife, maybe?

268
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,510
Let us show you something.

269
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:27,513
It's Bonaire, off the coast of northern Venezuela.

270
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,521
Three years ago, fishermen caught in a hurricane

271
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:33,989
reported strange and beautiful lights landing in the water.

272
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:40,043
The next day, all the fishermen showed up on a beach--

273
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,785
naked--not a mark on 'em.

274
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:47,244
A week later, they all killed themselves.

275
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,649
That's La Isla de la Juventud,
The Isle of Youth, off Cuba.

276
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:59,774
One of Castro's nastiest prisons is there.

277
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,139
A year ago, on the heels of hurricane Charley,

278
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,031
the guards reported seeing "las luces" in the water.

279
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,201
Lights.

280
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,401
Shortly there after, the place imploded.

281
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:11,089
How?

282
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,793
After murdering half the prisoners,
all the guards committed suicide,

283
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:16,046
and none of this was made public, of course.

284
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,522
I only knew about it because
I was in Cuba at the time.

285
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,233
- Brazil?
- That's where we met.

286
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:27,334
That's enough.

287
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,058
Tell me what you know

288
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:35,171
- about my ex-wife.
- I think we already have.

289
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,570
You're saying she's gonna kill herself?

290
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,355
- I can't sit here any more.
- Sit back down.

291
00:20:38,356 --> 00:20:39,574
You're treating us like hostages.

292
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:41,133
What the hell do you think you were doin' to him?

293
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:43,537
We don't have time for this.
There are people out there

294
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:48,008
who may be dying right now,
killing themselves and their children

295
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:51,277
because they can't reconcile what's happened to them.

296
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,086
Who are you?

297
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:57,909
I'm an archaeologist...

298
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:01,385
and you're keeping me from my work.

299
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,321
Pria and her husband...

300
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:16,605
they were in Brazil in 2004

301
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,566
when the first hurricane ever recorded down there
made landfall.

302
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:28,794
They were separated by the storm,
but they found each other two days later.

303
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,364
He was in remarkably good shape
considering what he'd been through,

304
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,193
but he wasn't the same man.

305
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:38,811
They'd gone deep into the forest on a dig
and taken their children with them,

306
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:41,859
and one night while they were asleep,
he snapped.

307
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:47,954
He doused himself with gasoline, set himself a blaze,
and he walked into their tent.

308
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:54,073
Pria lost her whole family that night.

309
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:01,851
How long after the hurricane did this happen?

310
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,621
Less than a week.

311
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,019
I'm sorry, but we just can't trust
anyone anymore.

312
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:36,880
See anything out there, Lewis?

313
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:38,556
Nothin' yet, sir.

314
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:40,311
What exactly are we looking for?

315
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:43,778
Any sign of chemical contaminants,
discoloration.

316
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:53,492
Sir?

317
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,077
I think I see somethin'.

318
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,276
Lewis?

319
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:45,938
Lewis!

320
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:42,575
Where is it?

321
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,640
It's in the back.

322
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:48,798
Let's go.

323
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:09,320
- Looks like a piece of fish.
- I wish it were.

324
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,548
- Those your kids?
-  Yeah.

325
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,149
You wanna see 'em again?

326
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,919
All you have to do
is tell us what this is.

327
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,064
I think you know more than I do.

328
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:29,776
If that were the case, we wouldn't be here.

329
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,033
What were you doin' in Cuba?

330
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:38,391
You military? C.I.A.?

331
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:42,163
Why do you keep lookin' in the mirror?

332
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,231
Something out there scare you?

333
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:45,209
Change.

334
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:47,696
I don't know what the hell that means.

335
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,296
A lot of people went missing in the hurricane,

336
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,974
but no one's committing suicide here.

337
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:55,352
In fact, many people, my ex-wife included,
seem to be--

338
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,456
adapting?

339
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:59,398
You're right, Russell.
Things are different here,

340
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,416
and that should concern you.

341
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:06,636
When an invasive species enters the park,
what do you do?

342
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:08,197
I study it.

343
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:11,512
And if it poses a threat?
You kill it.

344
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:15,359
You think that's what we're dealing with here,

345
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,738
an invasive species?

346
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:17,997
I don't know, but whatever it is,

347
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:20,089
the people affected here seem to be thriving.

348
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:23,404
They're goin' to church,
supporting each other,

349
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:25,520
developing a community.

350
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:28,816
So I gotta ask myself,
what is it about this place

351
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:30,680
that makes everything so different?

352
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:33,308
Now these things have been in the water everywhere,

353
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:37,613
but in Cuba and in Brazil,
most everyone's dead now.

354
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,712
So what is it about this place?

355
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:40,896
I don't know.

356
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:43,104
I think we owe it to your children to find out...

357
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:45,237
don't you?

358
00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:01,600
What color?

359
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:03,582
I'm thinkin' maybe, like,
peachy kinda like.

360
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:04,684
Oh, yeah, I love that.

361
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:06,362
Yeah.
Morning, daddy.

362
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,693
Hey, hey.

363
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,940
- Honey.
- Hello.

364
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,101
What's the matter, eggs no good?

365
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:14,384
No. No, they're fine.

366
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:19,309
Are you okay?

367
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:24,715
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just thinkin' about stuff.

368
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,214
Lewis told me that he spoke with you.

369
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:33,428
Yeah. He mentioned that they found sea water
in that girl's lungs.

370
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:37,426
I told him that she could have drowned elsewhere.

371
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:40,084
That's possible, isn't it?

372
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:42,789
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

373
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,799
Is that what's bothering you?

374
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:47,216
You know me.

375
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:49,902
I always like to be thorough.

376
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:53,905
You can't save everybody.
You're only human.

377
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:00,607
See ya later, okay?

378
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:02,512
Okay.

379
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:51,429
- Lewis.
- Sir.

380
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,486
What are you doing here?
I mean, I...

381
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,266
How did you get to my house?

382
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:57,599
- I walked.
- You walked.

383
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,229
- Walked from where?
- The beach.

384
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,501
Come on in.
Come on.

385
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,363
Lewis...

386
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:18,326
do you know what happened to you last night?

387
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:23,097
- Not really, sir.
- Are you sure?

388
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:27,745
Yes, but I don't think
that really matters now.

389
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:30,605
Who am I to question a miracle?

390
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,062
Well, I don't know if
I'd call it a miracle, but...

391
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:37,115
Oh, it's a miracle, sir.

392
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:43,975
It's a miracle.

393
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,906
The human D.N.A. came
from blood, that was in this tentacle.

394
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:02,202
I think it acts like a feeding tube.

395
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:03,570
These are the suckers at the end here,

396
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,513
and this looks like a proboscis that could

397
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,606
- easily pierce the skin.
- Guys, I have to pee.

398
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,485
- Hold on.
- No, man, I can't.

399
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:10,855
I've been strapped in this chair all night.

400
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,379
Why does he get to walk around, and I don't?

401
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,740
- We'll take you outside in a minute.
- I can't wait that long.

402
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:18,856
Any trace of a digestive enzyme?

403
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:22,178
No.

404
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,005
I'm not sure this even leads to a stomach.

405
00:30:24,352 --> 00:30:26,328
I mean, most of this is blubber, but right here...

406
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:29,757
this tissue is different.

407
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:32,423
It's muscular.
It's lined with a soft membrane.

408
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:35,089
It's similar to what you might find
in the inner lining of a uterus.

409
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:38,251
So it's a womb?

410
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:41,568
All right, if somebody doesn't come over
and let me out of this chair,

411
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,242
- I'm just gonna piss all over everybody.
- Shut up!

412
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:44,689
You shut up, man!
I gotta take a piss!

413
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,329
- What do you want me to do?
- You gotta be quiet.

414
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,194
What, is that--is that what you're afraid of?

415
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,793
Are you afraid somebody might hear me?

416
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:51,358
Are you afraid someone's gonna hear me yellin'

417
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,745
about how I'm gonna take a piss?!

418
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:54,648
Hey! Stop it!

419
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:01,886
I'll take him outside.

420
00:31:14,397 --> 00:31:15,153
Unstoppable.

421
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,581
For two... and another two.

422
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,835
What could I possibly say to him, Tom?

423
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,208
It has to be a miracle, and if he wants
to tell the world about it, he should.

424
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:28,837
I'm left-handed.

425
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,784
- But who would believe him?
- The faithful.

426
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:34,493
No, they won't.

427
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:36,743
They'll think he's a freak.

428
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,203
Tom, every sunday

429
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:44,436
I stand behind my altar
and proclaim the mystery of faith,

430
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:47,826
a mystery that is at the very center of my beliefs--

431
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,341
death and resurrection.

432
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:53,781
It happened to me...

433
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,874
the night of the hurricane, I was dead,
but God chose to save me.

434
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:01,708
He's done the same for Lewis in a way

435
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,652
we could never possibly imagine.

436
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:04,977
But you're not hearing me, father.

437
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:09,859
I need you to tell this boy that
what happened to him is wrong,

438
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,265
that it goes against nature.

439
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:13,981
Believe me, it's in his best interests.

440
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,192
People are terrified of what they don't understand,

441
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:18,437
and they won't understand him.

442
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:20,553
Please, somebody call me on the double dribble.

443
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:21,561
They'll wanna dissect him.

444
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:23,077
Hell, they'll wanna dissect all of us,

445
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,584
and I cannot let that happen.

446
00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:34,946
Perhaps he could be convinced
that this miracle is his and his alone...

447
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,756
A private communion with God.

448
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,022
Or...

449
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:47,067
as a test of his faith...

450
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:53,209
maybe a greater sacrifice is necessary.

451
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,050
Oh. You know, if you had've just
told me your name

452
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:06,602
in the first place, this would have been a little easier.

453
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:08,852
I couldn't.
We had to know who you were.

454
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:11,677
Ah. So if these things really are changing people,

455
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:13,352
is this, like, the end of the world?

456
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,534
I have no idea.

457
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:18,044
Oh, 'cause I, uh...

458
00:33:18,393 --> 00:33:20,261
spent some time with Russ's ex recently,

459
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:23,055
and she seemed pretty good--

460
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,340
nicer than she used to be, actually.

461
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,208
So if this has happened to her,

462
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:29,531
I--it doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing,
does it?

463
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:30,826
I mean, just 'cause something is different,

464
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:33,036
doesn't necessarily make it bad.
It could still be good, right?

465
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:34,026
Well, it wasn't good for me.

466
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:37,747
Maybe Russel have the answer

467
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,029
Pria?

468
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:45,947
- Russell!
- What's wrong?

469
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:47,178
- She's been shot.
- What?

470
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:48,179
It's okay. It's okay.

471
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,291
It's okay. It's okay.

472
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,416
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

473
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:54,599
Stay here!

474
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:56,471
We gotta get her to a hospital.

475
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:59,531
- I'm all right.
- No, you're not.

476
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,514
Please. It's too far.

477
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:02,542
Pria.

478
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:07,038
I have to show you something.

479
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,531
It--it's amazing.

480
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:22,158
I got so used to the one,
that having two just feels so...

481
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:24,518
abundant.

482
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:27,193
I am truly blessed.

483
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,746
We all are, Lewis.

484
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,918
Are you sure there are poachers living here?

485
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:35,234
It looks abandoned.

486
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:39,956
You never know,
and even if there aren't...

487
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:44,602
it's nice to be so close to the water, isn't it?

488
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:47,698
- It feels good.
- Actually, it does.

489
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,670
Water saved my life.

490
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:55,050
- The plane crash, sir?
- Yeah.

491
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,152
That was a nightmare, Lewis,
but I lived through it.

492
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:03,095
I survived.

493
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,598
Not that everyone was happy
about that, mind you.

494
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:10,611
- What do you mean, sir?
- Well, a lot of people resented me...

495
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,545
thought I was a...

496
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,141
I don't know, a freak or somethin'.

497
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:19,807
The first years, they were the toughest.

498
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:26,892
My "miracle" brought the people
around me a lot of grief.

499
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,423
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

500
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,991
But maybe my experience...

501
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,767
could spare you the same fate.

502
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,306
People don't like different, Lewis.

503
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:01,383
Sir.

504
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:02,693
It won't be good for you.

505
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:06,248
It won't.

506
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:10,009
When you were in the hospital,

507
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,792
you posted a blog about a skeleton

508
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,303
you found in the water near everglades city.

509
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:15,012
Yeah.

510
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:16,956
You said it was in the trunk of your car.

511
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,243
It was you.You took it.

512
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:27,154
It looks like the person was killed
by one of these creatures from the water.

513
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:33,895
It's almost 10 years old, which would make it
the first we know of.

514
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:36,218
I've been reconstructing the skull.

515
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:39,191
It's back there.

516
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,398
Pria!

517
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:47,797
- You see who did this?
- No...

518
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:52,027
but if they know we're here,
they'll be back.

519
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:53,438
- Who?
- Who are you talk--

520
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:55,114
who's after you?

521
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,321
- Who do you think?
- Where are you going?

522
00:36:57,483 --> 00:37:00,297
- We'll be in touch.
- Russ. Russ!

523
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:01,589
Dave, we gotta go.
We gotta get outta here.

524
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,378
No, come here. Come here.
You gotta see this.

525
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,605
She's given it a face.

526
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,028
This isn't God's plan, Sir.

527
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:40,024
- How do you know?
- Because he gave me a gift.

528
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,206
That's right, Lewis.

529
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:42,781
- So why do you wanna go against him?

530
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:44,160
- Go against him?

531
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,923
He took your arm for a reason, son,
to challenge you.

532
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:49,053
It defines who you are now.

533
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,558
Wasn't that his plan?

534
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:56,634
Yeah.

535
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,133
I don't know what to do, sir.

536
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:07,419
I don't know what to do.

537
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,858
Listen. Listen.

538
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:16,105
Then do what's right.

539
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,458
Okay?
