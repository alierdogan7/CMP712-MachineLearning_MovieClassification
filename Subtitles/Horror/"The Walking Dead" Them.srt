00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,927
No!

Begging me for mercy.

5
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:10,865
Maybe it's because we're still the same.

6
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:13,474
I don't think I can be...
Not anymore.

7
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:15,033
We made it.

8
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:16,484
It's gone.

9
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:19,212
He did the math and realized that Washington
is the place where there'd be a chance.

10
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:22,066
We should go.
We should go to Washington.

11
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:25,231
You gotta hold on, man.
Hold on!

Oh, shit.

17
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,196
It's been a day and a half.

18
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:07,802
They didn't find any either.

19
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:10,740
- Sasha:<i> How do you know?</i>
- I know.

20
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,517
How much longer we got?

21
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,021
60 miles.

22
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:27,057
I wasn't talking about that.

We're not at our strongest.

We'll get 'em when it's best.

30
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,352
High ground,
something like that.

31
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,187
They're not going anywhere.

32
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:07,057
It's been three weeks
since Atlanta.

33
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,559

00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:18,466
She's hungry.

36
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:23,202
She's okay.

37
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:25,272
She's going to be okay.

38
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:30,440
We need to find water, food.

39
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,776
We'll hit something in the road.

40
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,350
<i>It's gonna rain sooner or later.</i>

41
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:42,416
I'm gonna head out.

42
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,717
See what I can find.

43
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,720
Hey, don't be too long.

44
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,219
I'll go with you.

45
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:51,251
I got it.

46
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,118
You gonna stop me?

47
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,218
Found this when we were
looking for water.

48
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,285
What is it?

49
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:05,686
I think it used to play music.

50
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:08,286
<i>It's broken.</i>

51
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:12,957
Thanks, Carl.

52
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,958
I thought you might like it.

53
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,834
I used to joke these
things were leftovers

54
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:31,037
from the days of hair shirts.

55
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,806
The church actually made...

56
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,513
shirts out of hair.

57
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,416
So if you wore it,
you could atone

58
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,753
just a little for your sins.

59
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,523
I know what a hair shirt is.

60
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,524
My daddy was religious.

61
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:51,829
I used to be.

62
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,768
If you ever want to talk

63
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,208
about your father

64
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,709
or about Beth...

65
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:03,744
Please, stop.

66
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:09,449
Whenever you're ready, I'm here.

67
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:11,952
You never even met them.

68
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:16,525
- I know you're in pain.
- You don't know shit.

69
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,766
You had a job.

70
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,967
You were there
to save your flock, right?

71
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,905
But you didn't.

72
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:26,809
You hid.

73
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,714
Don't act like
that didn't happen.

74
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,590

75
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:04,110
We can take 'em.

76
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,582
Rick's right.

77
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:10,951
We barely have anything left.

78
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,288
No use in spending it all now.

79
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,558
I can take 'em.

80
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:22,701
Your brother was pissed, too,

81
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,766
after what he lost.

82
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,569
- It made him stupid.
- We are not the same.

83
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:34,343
We never were.

84
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:36,345
But it's still the same.

85
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,386
It just is.

86
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,880
<i>Anything?</i>

87
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:05,082
No, it's too dry.

88
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:06,615
There ain't nothing here.

89
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,685
Maybe we should start back.

90
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:10,487
You go.

91
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,189
I think she saved my life.

92
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,197
She saved your life, too, right?

93
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,834
It was hers.

94
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,680
We're not dead.

95
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:51,085
That's what you said.

96
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,797
You're not dead.

97
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,368

98

We're different.
I can't let myself--

99

But you...

100
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,081
I know you.

101
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:17,087
You have to let
yourself feel it.

102
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,847
You will.

in the same day...

162

it was ever really there.

to fight it anymore.

189
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:12,913
What else are we gonna do?

190
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,672
Not this.

191
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:16,959
We don't know who left it.

192
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:19,462
If that's a trap, we already
happen to be in it.

193
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:23,100
But I, for one, would like to
think it is indeed from a friend.

194
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,135
What if it isn't?
They put something in it?

195
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,939
- Rosita: Eugene.
- Tara: What are you doing, dude?

196
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,073
Quality assurance.

197
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,922
We can't.

Rick: Everybody get the bags.
Anything you can find.

205
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,342
I'm sorry.

206
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,778

She had a gun.

214
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:34,594
She could have shot herself.

215
00:30:36,197 --> 00:30:38,633
Some people can't give up.

216
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,172
Like us.

Carol:
<i>He's gonna be okay.</i>

220
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:28,556
He bounces back

221
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:30,724
more than any of us do.

222
00:31:30,726 --> 00:31:34,695
I used to feel sorry for kids
that have to grow up now.

223
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:36,662
In this.

224
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,230
But I think I got it wrong.

225
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:46,564
<i>Growing up is getting
used to the world.</i>

226
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:51,835
<i>This is easier for them.</i>

227
00:31:51,837 --> 00:31:53,937
This isn't the world.

228
00:31:55,804 --> 00:31:57,407
This isn't it.

229
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:07,351
It might be.

230
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:10,956
It might.

231
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,658
- That's giving up.
- It's reality.

232
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,065
Until we see otherwise, this
is what we have to live with.

233
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:35,188
When I was a kid...

234
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,155
I asked my grandpa once if he ever
killed any Germans in the war.

235
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:44,655
He wouldn't answer.

236
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:49,425
He said that was
grown-up stuff, so...

237
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,031
so I asked if the Germans
ever tried to kill him.

238
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,669
But he got real quiet.

239
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:11,582
He said he was dead the minute
he stepped into enemy territory.

240
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:18,058
Every day he woke up

241
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,760
and told himself,
"Rest in peace.

242
00:33:20,762 --> 00:33:22,662
Now get up
and go to war."

243
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:29,503
And then after a few years
of pretending he was dead...

244
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,279
he made it out alive.

245
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,951
<i>That's the trick of it, I think.</i>

246
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,389
We do what we need to do

247
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,991
and then we get to live.

248
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,328
<i>But no matter</i>
<i>what we find in DC,</i>

249
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,865
I know we'll be okay.

250
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:58,739
Because this is how we survive.

251
00:34:01,478 --> 00:34:03,778
We tell ourselves...

252
00:34:05,914 --> 00:34:08,919
that we are the walking dead.

253
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:25,201

He was.

00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,871
So was she.
