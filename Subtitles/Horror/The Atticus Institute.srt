Good.

7
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,349
My dad had three kids.
Ahem.

8
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,644
Me, my sister, and the institute.

9
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,107
That's just the way it was.

10
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,831
You knew that if you had
a baseball game

11
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,649
or, I don't know,
some sort of special event,

12
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,896
there was always a good chance
he might not be there.

13
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,288
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he was there a good amount of the time.

14
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,370
Just not all the time.

15
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,501
I remember I tried to trick him
into thinking I had ESP.

16
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,792
Or that I was moving stuff
around with my mind,

17
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,711
hoping it might get him
to pay a little more attention.

18
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,597
And he'd play along
for a few minutes,

19
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,885
but then he'd leave for work.

20
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,264
I was four, um,
when it happened.

21
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,183
So I don't have too many
memories of my father.

22
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,068
I kinda remember what it felt like
to be with him.

23
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,652
Talking with me, holding me.

24
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,214
One thing I've always remembered
is this game we used to play

25
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,736
on nights when
he'd put me to bed.

26
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,406
He'd ask all these questions
about animals.

27
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,121
How many eyes does a fish have?

28
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,126
And I'd say, "Two."

29
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,708
How many noses
does a monkey have?

30
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,714
How many ears
does a gopher have?

31
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,126
That's really all there was to it.

32
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,420
I remember thinking it was fun.

33
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,302
We got married in 1965.

34
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,438
I wanted children right away,
but Henry wanted to wait.

35
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,691
'Cause it was about that time
that he was starting the institute.

36
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,899
And then he had
a different research lab job

37
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,066
at the same time
so we could make rent.

38
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,486
He worked a lot.
Even after we had both kids.

39
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,613
But he loved it.

40
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,782
You know?

41
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,668
A man has the right
to love his work.

42
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,591
Lawrence Henault: Our goal was
to conduct unbiased, empirical research

43
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,473
on exceptional human abilities.

44
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,885
Psychokinesis, ESP, precognition.

45
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,522
Things that are typically considered
fringe science or parapsychology.

46
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,402
Dr. West, and the rest of us,
quite frankly,

47
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,904
all believed that
there was real science

48
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,905
to be discovered
in these areas.

49
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,240
We had a good time
doing what we were doing.

50
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,076
We were underfunded, of course,

51
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,115
but we were still relatively young,
so it didn't matter.

52
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,250
In the first few years alone,

53
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,539
we published close to
30 journal articles between us.

54
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,675
And there were
some truly exceptional cases.

55
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,302
All documented.

56
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,221
Well, we did a lot of different
kinds of tests, but, uh,

57
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,309
probably the most effective one
to measure clairvoyant abilities

58
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,394
were the Zener cards.

59
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,184
This one?

60
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,943
It's the lines.
The wavy lines.

61
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,484
WHEELER: Well, if you
select each card at random,

62
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,699
then the success ratio
will be <i>close</i> to 20%.

63
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,240
But we had several subjects

64
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,876
whose ratio was closer to 30%.

65
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,288
And that might not seem
like very much,

66
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,128
but if you realize
that we did each test

67
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,543
over 200 times,

68
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,427
you begin to understand

69
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,214
the virtual impossibility
of that figure.

70
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,434
SUSAN GERMAN:I think we were all secretly hoping

71
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,813
to discover the next Nina Kulagina.

72
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,601
She was a woman
from the former Soviet Union.

73
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,644
Truly remarkable.

74
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,733
Nina's psychokinetic abilities were
probably the most well-documented

75
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,244
and they stood up
to the strictest of scrutiny.

76
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,033
The closest we encountered
to that level was Norman LeClair.

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,747
French-Canadian man.

78
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,007
Norman's PK abilities
were astounding at times.

79
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,179
- (GAME VIBRATING)
- DR. WEST: That's how it works.

80
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,934
Pretty simple, huh?

81
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,390
- Yeah.
- (GAME SHUTS OFF)

82
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,896
Try to vibrate the game board.

83
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,535
It's all right.
Take your time.

84
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,213
That's all right. You gave it
your best shot. We can try again later.

85
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,834
HENAULT: Dr. West brought in colleagues,

86
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,972
some well-known and esteemed researchers
at the time,

87
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,303
to observe Norman.

88
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,308
All the necessary steps
were taken

89
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,346
to prevent any claims
of researcher bias

90
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,980
or improper testing methods.

91
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,688
GERMAN: All outside variables were controlled,

92
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,820
for this was to be
the moment the snickering,

93
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,653
the talking behind hands
would finally stop.

94
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,159
This was proof.

95
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,334
- God, I can't believe that.
- Explain that.

96
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,299
- As we said.
- How do you explain that one?

97
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,163
- (CHUCKLING)
- How do you explain that?

98
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,294
- What do you guys think?
- Oh, my God.

99
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,251
WHEELER: Oh, they were clearly impressed.

100
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,040
Even though, I'd have to say,

101
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,051
they didn't really
allow themselves to show it.

102
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,554
I was happy-
I was happy for Hem!!-

103
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,216
He had worked so hard
for that moment.

104
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:56,479
But then,
just before the researchers left...

105
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,561
one of them noticed
something odd

106
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,444
on the wristwatch
of one of our research assistants.

107
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,900
And it turned out that this watch

108
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,569
had been rigged with a small
neodymium magnet.

109
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,578
And every one of our tests

110
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,910
involved metal in some capacity.

111
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,623
Even the trace amounts
of iron in the cereal.

112
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,501
And this guy had been complicit
with Norman's ruse

113
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,086
right from the start.

114
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,798
Right under our noses.
It was-

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,713
it was a crushing blow.

116
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,348
For the institute's credibility

117
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,010
and for Henry's reputation.

118
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,304
It was... it was awful.

119
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,450
Is there something else
we should know about?

120
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,990
Judith?

121
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,500
With you?

122
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,214
(WHISPERING)
It's like, um...

123
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,428
it's like being
in a well sometimes.

124
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,855
I can see it, I can hear it,
but nobody knows I'm there.

125
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,948
I'd... I'd like to help you.

126
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,285
Whatever is going on.

127
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,744
WHEELER: Judith was first
brought to the institute

128
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,662
in September of 1976
by her sister-

129
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,170
sister Margaret.

130
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,549
She had been reading
about the work we were doing

131
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,459
in a small magazine
or something.

132
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,256
And she thought we would
be interested in testing Judith.

133
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,970
The first thing she did
when she walked in

134
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,510
was she told me
it was my birthday.

135
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,976
Which caught me
a bit off guard.

136
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,187
Not because it was my birthday.
It wasn't, it was the day before.

137
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,398
Maybe it was a guess.

138
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,233
You see, that's something

139
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,114
you always have to guard against
with the work we did.

140
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,617
Lucky guesses.
False positives.

141
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,122
If you let yourself fall victim
to a belief bias of any kind,

142
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,410
that's when you start
forcing the pieces together.

143
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,829
Even when they don't fit at all.

144
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,043
Judith...

145
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,712
she seemed average.

146
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,551
She's in her early 40s.

147
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,057
Can't say there's anything particularly
remarkable about her appearance.

148
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,140
She was kind of the type of person
that you would pass by

149
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,724
on the street in any town.

150
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,731
You might say hello, smile,
but that's about it.

151
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,274
You would have no idea

152
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,438
that Judith was what she was.

153
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,665
I was older than her
by seven years.

154
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,452
She was a silly kid.

155
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,121
And we had a lot of fun.

156
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,339
There was one day,
she was around 35,

157
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,472
she slipped on a patch of ice
on the sidewalk

158
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,600
and hurt her back pretty badly.

159
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,396
And after that,
she had a little trouble moving,

160
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,432
getting around.

161
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,899
And her pain was consistent.

162
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,280
It was chronic.

163
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,613
It was enough that
my husband and I decided

164
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,994
that she shouldn't be
living alone anymore.

165
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,123
So she moved in
with us and the kids.

166
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,285
About a year after
Judith moved in,

167
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,954
she began to withdraw.

168
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,340
I mean, she would stay
in her room for days.

169
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,297
I'm not sure
she would even eat.

170
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,465
I don't know what she did
when she was alone.

171
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,056
She was reading
some very unusual books.

172
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,470
And that's when it all started.

173
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,560
And I knew things weren't right.

174
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,521
There were things-

175
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,153
there were things
that I saw her do

176
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,486
that I just-

177
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,650
I had to do something.

178
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,698
And to this day,
part of me still regrets

179
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,333
doing what I did, but I had to.

180
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,166
GERMAN: But Dr. West was intrigued
with Judith almost immediately.

181
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,549
Yeah, we all were.

182
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,461
By this point,
we'd researched hundreds of cases,

183
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,131
brought in almost as many
subjects into the lab.

184
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,723
Judith was different, though.

185
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,848
We just had no idea
how different at this point.

186
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,485
DR. WEST: Um, ahem.
Can you tell us your name, please?

187
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,871
Ahem. Judith Winstead.

188
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,702
And what's your date of birth,
Judith?

189
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,959
February 18th, 1935.

190
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,120
And your marital status?

191
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,038
I'm not married.

192
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,878
Have you ever been?

193
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,509
Okay.
How many siblings do you have?

194
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,717
One.

195
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,677
Are your parents still alive?

196
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,062
- Judith, are your parents still alive?
- No.

197
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,724
Okay. Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

198
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,736
Judith's behavior was always odd.
Even from the first day she arrived.

199
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,569
But in our field, it wasn't uncommon
to encounter odd people.

200
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,608
So we didn't give it much thought.

201
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,242
WHEELER: Ms. Winstead?

202
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,829
Right-handed.

203
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,119
DR. WEST: And when did you first realize

204
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,754
you had certain abilities?

205
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,084
Are you... are you all right, dear?

206
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,253
- (SHUDDERING)
- Oh...

207
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,094
You're bleeding.
Oh, my God.

208
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,803
- (YELLS)
- WHEELER: Here's some...

209
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
DR. WEST: Give her some towels.

210
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,103
WHEELER: Oh, uh, tilt your head back, okay?

211
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,542
- (LAUGHING)
- Pinch your nose.

212
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,182
DR. WEST: It's not her nose,
it's her hand. Her hand is bleeding.

213
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,147
WHEELER: What?
Did you... did you bite yourself?

214
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,439
DR. WEST: Why?

215
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,530
Susan, let's get her...
get her to the ladies' room, please.

216
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,615
GERMAN: As long as you're okay with it.

217
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,404
That's all right.
Just take her-that's all right.

218
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,494
DR. WEST: Just take care of her.

219
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,373
- GORMAN: Judith?
- (LOUD BANGING)

220
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,957
- Wait, is she... no, no, no.
- (JUDITH SCREAMING)

221
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,542
What is she doing?
Stop.

222
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,799
- GORMAN: Just stop. Calm down.
- JUDITH: Let go.

223
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,335
DR. WEST: Ms. Winstead.
Judith, stop, please.

224
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,632
Well, for starters,
Judith came to us in an unusual way.

225
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,301
Most times, we learn of someone
and seek them out.

226
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,596
We had no idea
Judith was even out there.

227
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,149
Nevertheless, she tested beyond

228
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,310
what any of us thought
was even possible.

229
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,985
There was no measure.

230
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,322
Truly no measure
for her abilities.

231
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,280
If you can, try for seven this time.

232
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,074
Any combination.

233
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,378
DR. WEST: Three and four.

234
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,381
- (DICE THUDS)
- One and six.

235
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,918
- (DICE THUDS)
- Three and four.

236
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,178
- (DICE THUDS)
- One and six.

237
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,802
- (DICE THUDS)
- Two and five.

238
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,222
Uh, Judith, what I'd like you
to try to do

239
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,141
is to move the wheel
without actually touching it.

240
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,822
Try to concentrate your mind.
Focus your thoughts.

241
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,657
She outperformed every subject
we'd ever studied.

242
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,703
There was no comparison
to be made.

243
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,714
I understand how peculiar
it might seem

244
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,547
to hear her abilities described
in this way, but they were godlike.

245
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,561
Okay, Judith,
what do you see this time?

246
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,475
- Judith?
- Star.

247
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,147
- And this time.
- Square.

248
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,444
- (LAUGHS)
- And what do you see this time?

249
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,362
<i>Mm.</i>

250
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,326
(JUDITH STUTTERS)

251
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,115
Judith, are you all right?

252
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,875
Are you all right, Judith?
Do you...

253
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,707
can we continue
with the exercise?

254
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,671
- I think she's-
- Judith?

255
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,628
I think she's okay.
All right, let's resume.

256
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,087
Judith, what...

257
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,046
- The card bent.
- What?

258
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,076
- That card bent. We're taking a break.
- What do you mean?

259
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,852
Dr. West?

260
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,273
WHEELER: Looking back, I-

261
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,812
I guess I should've known better.

262
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,490
I mean, yes, we'd seen...

263
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,995
witnessed amazing things
in the past.

264
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,496
But nothing like that.

265
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,749
Nothing, nothing like that.

266
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,961
Inverse square law.

267
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,621
Conservation of momentum.

268
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,632
These were well-established
laws of physics

269
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,043
that were being violated.

270
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,132
The second law
of thermodynamics.

271
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,299
All of these.
We should've been scared.

272
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,342
Someone
with that much power would-

273
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,683
but we were too excited
to be scared.

274
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,473
We finally had the proof...

275
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,517
not another hoax-

276
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,732
that we'd been seeking for years.

277
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,741
We had our Nina Kulagina.

278
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,504
GORMAN: What I remember,
she was due to...

279
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,506
stay overnight in the lab
through the weekend.

280
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,105
We did this quite often
with subjects

281
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,843
because anomalous events

282
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,675
sometimes occur
during the deep-sleep cycle.

283
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,341
And we monitored the subjects
through the night

284
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,930
using various recording devices.

285
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,852
During Judith's first overnight,
we only had one staff member present.

286
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,440
Kenneth.

287
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,073
I don't ever think
I knew his last name.

288
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,360
He was a graduate student
at the time.

289
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,903
Nice, quiet kid.

290
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,572
Came from a fanning family.
I remember that because so do I.

291
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:45,670
He was... he was alone
with Judith that night

292
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,205
sitting not far from her bed.

293
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,295
I don't even think he knew
that he was being recorded

294
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,426
because you can
see him smoking,

295
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,713
which he wasn't supposed
to be doing in the lab.

296
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,720
Nothing happened for hours.

297
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,032
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

298
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,113
Nobody ever found out
what happened.

299
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,996
But whatever did...

300
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,040
that was it for him.

301
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,080
Never came back.

302
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,115
W-we tried contacting
Judith's sister, Margaret.

303
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,992
We couldn't reach her.

304
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,070
She'd disconnected her phone.

305
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,787
It became clear at that moment...

306
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,122
that Margaret
had abandoned her.

307
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,505
The decision now
was what we were gonna do.

308
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,917
I could tell that Lawrence was already
reaching a bit of a breaking point.

309
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,506
It was obvious.

310
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,889
It wasn't so obvious
with Dr. West.

311
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,674
Not to me anyway.

312
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,355
WHEELER: Well, we simply
made the decision

313
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,517
that we were going
to continue our testing with her.

314
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:17,359
But after that night,
it became extremely difficult.

315
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,863
It was so unnerving.

316
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,528
Her behavior.

317
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,573
It was so incredibly...

318
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,707
she would say things

319
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,369
and do things that made you...

320
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,547
She would scream in that voice.

321
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,253
- (SCREAMING)
- Grab her!

322
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,423
It wasn't hers.

323
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,634
It was like an animal.

324
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,434
WHEELER: Henry seemed most affected by it.

325
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,938
He tried his best
to shield the others from that.

326
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,394
I knew him well enough to know

327
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,185
that he was deeply affected.

328
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,242
STEVEN: I watched my father change firsthand.

329
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,074
And I have no doubt whatsoever
that what happened in that lab

330
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,989
caused that change.

331
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,955
CATHLEEN: I remember being
in the seventh grade

332
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,790
years later,

333
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,955
and other kids making fun of me.

334
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,296
Call him crazy.

335
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,256
They'd say I'd be crazy.

336
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,265
PATRICIA: Back then,
it was different than it is now.

337
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,892
Now everyone has a therapist.

338
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,554
They go for anything-
stubbed toe.

339
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,188
But back then,

340
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,442
you went if it was
something bad.

341
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,616
And especially
if medication was involved.

342
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,244

it was.

00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,971
THERAPIST: I can't help you
if you don't tell me

349
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,490
- what you think is happening.
- DR. WEST: I can't tell you.

350
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,182
THERAPIST: What are you so afraid of, Henry?

351
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,978
I know it's very trying,

352
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,489
but we would really like
to continue.

353
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,652
- Can you please stop that, Judith?
- Can you please stop that, please?

354
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,164
We'd really like to continue-
(VEINS)

355
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,417
We had about 10 different degrees
between us.

356
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,624
Including one in medicine,

357
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,288
three in psychology.

358
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,584
And we knew...

359
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,720
that was not normal.

360
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,099
WHEELER: Judith was not
a typical test subject.

361
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,057
She had made that
abundantly clear by that point.

362
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,690
And I felt we needed help.

363
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,659
ROBERT KOEPP: I received a file
from another analyst.

364
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,857
It was something he thought
I should take a look at.

365
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:15,332
We started a program to
investigate psi in the early '10s.

366
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,038
Psi-related phenomenon.

367
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,375
About five years after KGB
conducted similar studies.

368
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,967
I didn't have the highest
expectations going in.

369
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,094
I felt we'd already
been down that road.

370
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,132
And it proved to be
a waste of time and money.

371
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,802
But Marcus was a friend of a friend,
and so I went.

372
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,064
It's difficult to explain.

373
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,693
But you could feel something...

374
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,945
a weight, an invisible weight.

375
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,237
The whole lab
took on that feeling

376
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,747
the minute he stepped
through the door.

377
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,373
Henault: It was if he represented
a challenge to her,

378
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,209
to her power.

379
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,341
Everything we had seen
up until that point,

380
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,127
everything Judith had done,
everything we'd witnessed,

381
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,924
it barely compared
to what happened after he arrived.

382
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,219
KOEPP: I assumed they'd run
through the usual battery of psi tests.

383
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,481
The cards, the elaborate devices
with the numbers, but they didn't.

384
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,643
They told me that those tests
weren't right for her.

385
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,111
DR. WEST: This here's a way
to convince anyone.

386
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,154
Easiest and simplest way
to begin the demonstration.

387
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,561
Now you understand
why we've called you in here.

388
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,098
That can't be accounted for

389
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,894
through any known
rational explanation.

390
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,404
And she's able to repeat it
with a variety of different materials.

391
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,440
Breaking the third law
of thermal dynamics.

392
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,493
GERMAN: By the time the man
from the Defense Intelligence Agency,

393
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,377
Robert Koepp, arrived,

394
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,504
we'd given up on
our standard testing procedure.

395
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,291
Well, we'd simply talked to her.

396
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,175
It was so difficult.

397
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,300
She knew...

398
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,187
too much.

399
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,474
Think of any object.

400
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,518
- KOEPP: Something in the room?
- No, it doesn't have to be.

401
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,404
No, let's make it something
not in the room.

402
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,856
- GORMAN: Okay.
- KOEPP: Okay.

403
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,820
Draw what you see, please.

404
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,715
And what object
were you thinking of?

405
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,550
A hammer.

406
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,392
(NO AUDIO)

407
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,897
- Excuse me.
- Susan?

408
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,774
- Susan.
- Henry, she...

409

- (BANGING)
- You don't frighten me!

410
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,316
- You don't fucking know!
- Susan! Stop it!

411
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,107
- What are you doing?!
- DR. WEST: Marcus!

412
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,571
- Susan, calm down.
- SUSAN: How dare you?!

413
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,235
- You don't know anything!
- Take her outside, please.

414
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,404
Just take her outside.

415
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,823
GERMAN: She had drawn a shamrock.

416
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,290
Back in 1973,
three years earlier,

417
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,046
I had travelled back to London
for my mum's funeral.

418
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,926
I was devastated.

419
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,010
Her family had immigrated
to London from Ireland

420
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,925
and she was very proud
of her Irish heritage.

421
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,103
And in her casket,

422
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,764
she had worn the same brooch
that she'd worn

423
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,978
almost every day of her life.

424
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,150
It was a shamrock.

425
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,111
As soon as I saw that picture,

426
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,822
I realized what Judith
had whispered to me.

427
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,284
"You weren't there."

428
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,126
Which is true, I wasn't.

429
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,629
My mother died
the day before I made it home.

430
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,296
And that woman...

431
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,053
that thing somehow knew that.

432
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,340
And how much guilt.

433
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,139
She wanted me
to behave that way.

434
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,600
She wanted me to react that way.

435
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,815
To humiliate me
in front of my peers

436
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,274
by turning me into everything
I had tried so hard not to be.

437
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,118
Well, the incident with Susan
was very unsettling

438
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,500
because it demonstrated
Judith's ability to influence us.

439
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,332
She was definitely
influencing Henry.

440
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,795
He started to pull back.
Which was unlike him.

441
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,256
I thought he was gonna fight
the government's involvement,

442
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,886
but that didn't happen.

443
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,390

it became
a very different scenario.

00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,632
It didn't matter what
my preconceived notions were

before visiting the institute.

469
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,380
What mattered now
was national security.

The DIA report prompted swift action.

495

We looked at the evidence,

496
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,062
we reviewed the footage
of the seizure incident.

497
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:02,067
Dr. West had no history of epilepsy
or any related condition,

498
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,977
so it's highly unlikely

499
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,817
that the flashing lights
could've triggered it.

500
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,981
We could not say definitively

501
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,901
that Ms. Winstead
caused the seizure,

502
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,412
but we certainly
couldn't rule it out either.

503
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,417

the seriousness of this threat.

I can't speak to the specifics
of what was discussed,

505
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,960
but suffice it to say

506
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,844
if you're gonna inform the White House
of something as crazy as this,

507
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,424

impossibly high electrolyte levels.

molecular compound

512

was found in her tissue.

Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

1042
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:25,082
The situation was a disaster
in all possible ways.

1043
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,921
Local law enforcement
got involved,

1044
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,256
the media.

1045
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,386
They all wanted to know
what happened, naturally.

1046
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,468
They had a right to the story.

1047
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:36,134
Just not to all of it.

1048
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,645
I'm still not at liberty to discuss
much more than I have.

1049
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:43,604
Especially as it pertains to the events
that took place after that night.

1050
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,315
But I can tell you this...

1051
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,024
the measures taken were done

1052
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,565
with the best interests
of this country in mind.

1053
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:56,616
MARGARET: It wasn't until fairly recently

1054
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:01,125
that I found out
what happened to my sister.

1055
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,129
And as horrible
as it probably sounds,

1056
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,085
I preferred it that way.

1057
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,046
She was a good person.

1058
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,801
She was.

1059
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,008
But people change.

1060
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,223
Even good people.

1061
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,478
I know that the official story
was that he was crazy.

1062
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,685
He was a mad scientist

1063
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:28,319
who had finally lost the last
of his widely scattered marbles.

1064
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,649
But believe me when I tell you,

1065
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,989
Henry West was not crazy.

1066
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,828
Which I suppose...

1067
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,791
leaves us with
the alternate explanation.
