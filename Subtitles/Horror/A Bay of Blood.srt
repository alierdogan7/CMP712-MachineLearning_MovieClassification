1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,000
A BAY OF BLOOD

2
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,519
It's so nice,
the calm after the storm.

3
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,120
What is it?

4
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,200
Can you hear it?

5
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,879
What?

6
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,159
- It's a squonk.
- A squonk?

7
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,080
And what's that?

8
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,799
The squonk?

9
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,639
You surprise me.

10
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,200
A girl of your intelligence
doesn't know what a squonk is?

11
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,480
It's an animal
covered in moles

12
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,679
that can camouflage
itself perfectly.

13
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,200
I think it's exclusively female,
but it's easy to find

14
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,759
because it's very vain and
it never stops whining.

15
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,559
And when it's captured...
it dissolves into tears.

16
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,240
You act like a thief
where love's concerned.

17
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,360
You take it and run.

18
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,240
Other characteristics of the squonk
are sulkiness, diffidence

19
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,559
and possessiveness.

20
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,399
Very inconvenient qualities
for a personal secretary.

21
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,360
Well, more than that...

22
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,320
a partner in an affair as important
as this.

23
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,799
- Where are you going?
- To the bay.

24
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,480
We're on the home stretch,
I've got to close the deal.

25
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,720
The police suspended investigations
into the Countess' death,

26
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,679
there was no evidence.

27
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,840
A case of suicide.

28
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,480
Everything's fine.

29
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,720
I just need a signature.

30
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,000
Bye!

31
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,679
- Franco!
- Yes?

32
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,399
- Take me with you.
- Better not right now.

33
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,879
Maybe later.

34
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
But call me first.

35
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,440
Bye, squonk!

36
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,480
Bye. Be careful!

37
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,840
Give them to me!

38
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,519
You'll have a heart attack
chasing after that bug!

39
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,039
How do you know
it's the same one?

40
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,679
Because it's the only insect
that's escaped you.

41
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,080
Not the only, but he...

42
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,440
...is very intelligent and remembers
last autumn

43
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,679
when I put a ring round one of
his horns and let him go.

44
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,279
- Why?
- To study his habits.

45
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,879
Sure... to see if he's horny!

46
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,879
Men should leave others to
enjoy their freedom.

47
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,399
Even that poor octopus
was free once, Simone.

48
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,519
I study beetles because I love them.

49
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,200
Yes, you pin them to boards

50
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,080
or preserve them in display cases.

51
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,159
At least I eat my octopus.

52
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,559
I don't kill as a hobby like you!

53
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,559
My God, Simon,
you make me feel like a murderer!

54
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,279
I didn't say that,
Mr Fossati.

55
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
When one kills contrary to the laws
of nature, one becomes a monster.

56
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,159
But man isn't an insect,
dear Simon.

57
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,399
We have thousands of years
of civilization behind us.

58
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,440
I don't know about that.

59
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,480
I wasn't there.

60
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,679
You've changed...

61
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,840
...ever since Federica was killed.

62
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,440
Suicide... Mr Fosatti.

63
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
Suicide.

64
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:48,399
The police said it was suicide.

65
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,240
Of course...

66
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,200
Sorry... a slip of the tongue!

67
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,559
Don't worry, Your Honour.

68
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,639
By tonight I'll have all the
documents signed by the heir.

69
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,600
Of course.

70
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,799
No, everything's in order.

71
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,639
We'll wait a while before starting
work, out of respect.

72
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,600
The poor Countess... well, she came to
a rather nasty end.

73
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Of course, I don't think I'm
underestimating your problems.

74
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,120
But it's an important enough deal
to justify a bit of a risk.

75
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,679
Leave it to me, Your Honour.

76
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,000
Everything will go smoothly.
Just take care of the permits.

77
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,440
Okay, Your Honour. Certainly.

78
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,519
I'll drop by and see you.

79
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,759
My respects, Your Honour.

80
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,279
Ready, sir.

81
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,039
- Here. Goodbye.
- Thanks.

82
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,879
Look how beautiful it is!

83
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Look, it's lovely!
It's like a paradise on earth.

84
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,039
Well, we mustn't fall from grace
here then!

85
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,919
Why not? That's what we came for!

86
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,799
Go, Roberto!

87
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,039
- Hands off!
- I haven't even started yet.

88
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,360
Yes, you have!

89
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,360
- Fetrol, gentlemen?
- Petrol!

90
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,799
You've been here a year
and you can't say it yet!

91
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,320
You Italians only teach us
the dirty words!

92
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,000
Come on, Roberto!

93
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,679
Who cares, we didn't come here
to teach them Italian.

94
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,960
- Don't you like me anymore?
- I'll show you how much!

95
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,879
Look how lonely it is here!

96
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,519
Come on, Robert.

97
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,000
Come on...

98
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,559
We've found a night club, come on!
There's even a dance floor!

99
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,279
Let's go! At least we can dance!

100
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,640
Louise, give me the tape recorder.

101
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
Here it is!

102
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,400
Sylvie, put on some music.
It's like a mausoleum in here!

103
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,880
No point trying to set the scene
for some Latin seduction!

104
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,119
This place is more Sibelius
than Puccini!

105
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,119
Hold the culture!

106
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,640
Come on, climb up!
You too!

107
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Great, there's a platform too!
Come on, Robert, let's do the shake!

108
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,880
You and me will do the tango.

109
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,759
The Aleph...

110
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,680
...the one... the all...

111
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,200
the void...

112
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,400
The lines of air, water,
fire and earth

113
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,359
are complete.

114
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,640
Paolo!

115
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,160
You could at least
answer when I call!

116
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,480
Don't yell,
you'll upset the little fellows.

117
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,039
You and your hateful bugs!

118
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,359
It's be absurd to think
you're capable of love.

119
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,880
Me?

120
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,559
I love many things,
but you'd never understand.

121
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,839
We don't understand anything,
right, Ferdinando?

122
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,880
Clouds of blood
are gathering over the bay.

123
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,359
Really? Just think, Ferdinando!
Now what?

124
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,599
The Aleph came out at the end
of the line of fire.

125
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,559
The Zaren was suspended
between the lines of water and air.

126
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,640
The sickle of death
is about to strike!

127
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,279
Oh really, your cards sometimes!

128
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:39,000
Last week the Aleph
came out first

129
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,119
and gusts of joy
were going to blow over The Bay.

130
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,119
Instead someone hanged
poor Federica!

131
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,640
You're more insensitive
than your beetles!

132
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,480
Can't you feel the chill of
death's icy breath?

133
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,839
All I hear is Ventura holding
the usual orgy in his cottage!

134
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,519
You hate Ventura for the same reason
you hated Federica's husband,

135
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,119
because he enjoys life
and you don't!

136
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,799
The formalin, be careful!

137
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,359
I hate him because he wants to turn
The Bay into a sea of cement.

138
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,799
But I won't let him!
Even if I have to...

139
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,759
- Not dancing, Robert?
- I'm no good at it.

140
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,240
Come on!

141
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
I'll take you to a private room.

142
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,759
Stop it! You're tickling me!

143
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,440
I only do it in bed.
And it must be comfortable!

144
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,480
Bourgeois!

145
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
I'm coming!

146
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,960
You big, sexy doll!

147
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,079
Come and see the swimming pool!

148
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,400
God, what a stink!

149
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,279
Here I go!

150
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,359
Careful, you'll trip!

151
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,640
I'll dive in!

152
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,039
I'm coming, Roberto!

153
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,880
Are you mad? Want to get typhus?
There might be a corpse in there.

154
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,920
You always say terrible things!

155
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,200
Maybe I found the bed.

156
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,759
- I'm going to swim in the sea.
- You'll get pneumonia.

157
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,720
- You want to die here?
- Let's go. Come on!

158
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,480
- Let's go and find this bed.
- But let's bring Roberto too.

159
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,160
Why him?

160
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,079
Don't leave me with this maniac!

161
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,440
Come on, boys!

162
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,039
What do you want?
Go for a swim!

163
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,039
- In this cold?
- Yes, this cold!

164
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,599
She's used to it. In her country
they eat whale blubber.

165
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,319
- It's like a museum.
- Maybe there's a watchman!

166
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
If you're scared, beat it.

167
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,039
Go on, push!

168
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,440
I knew it'd be locked.

169
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,240
Let's not be stupid!
This is private property.

170
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,640
- And the bed?
- Luca will take care of that!

171
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,839
Don't worry. A locked door
won't stop me!

172
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,720
Come on, Luca!
Show us what you're made of!

173
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,119
Don't you like girls?

174
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,200
What is this, a threesome?

175
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,119
- Actually, I...
- You did it, you're fantastic!

176
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,640
Come on, Roberto,
you're invited too.

177
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,799
Where are you going?
Look, yours is in the water.

178
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,799
The bed!

179
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,240
Sylvie,
go check out the bed.

180
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll be right with you.

181
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,240
The party's over for you.

182
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,400
You dumped the other one
to bother us? Are you a voyeur?

183
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,759
Here, be a native,
but do it outside!

184
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,599
Where's Roberto?

185
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,160
Just when I've found the bed!

186
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,079
What do you care about Roberto?
I'm here, aren't I?

187
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,680
Leave me alone!

188
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,839
Rapist!

189
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,759
Don't be so rough!
Where are you taking me?

190
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,680
Roberto, is that you?

191
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,200
Roberto, answer me!

192
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,119
Don't fool around!

193
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,440
I found a body!

194
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,079
Hell's bells!

195
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,440
He always pretends he can't hear!

196
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,639
Well, Alberto? Are you coming?

197
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,639
The kids.

198
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:03,159
It took me half an hour to get them
to go to sleep.

199
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,559
- Why leave the light on?
- You know they don't like the dark.

200
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,360
If you'd listened to me,
they'd be at their aunt's now,

201
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,719
but your sentimentalism...

202
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,760
At that harridan's?

203
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
Kids should be with their parents.

204
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,760
Don't start! Think about what
to ask the Fossatis.

205
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,159
Me? I thought I didn't know
how to think!

206
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,039
It's the truth, or we wouldn't
be reduced to this!

207
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,880
Good evening!

208
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360
Are you Mr Fossati?

209
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,480
I'm Donati's daughter. I'd like some
information about my father.

210
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,800
Is it convenient?

211
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,400
Excuse me, may we come in?

212
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,400
I'd like to talk
to your wife too.

213
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,400
Of course, Filippo Donati's death

214
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,679
threw a very strange light
on dear Federica's death.

215
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,480
Suicide, said the police.

216
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,199
But...

217
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,119
Suicide! Her!

218
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,639
I knew her well.

219
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
She clung to life, and how!

220
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,880
And she clung to her
property even more!

221
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:41,320
As I understand it, what you
actually want to say is that...

222
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,559
...Federica wouldn't have committed
suicide but...

223
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,760
Excuse me if I'm frank,
ma'am, but...

224
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,239
...your father wasn't suited
to this place.

225
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,760
Right, Ferdinando? Drink!
Another drop, and then to bed!

226
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,760
And tomorrow morning
a nice flight in the woods!

227
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,360
Excuse me, but,

228
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,800
you father was... a bit...
you understand?

229
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,960
Women... gambling...

230
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,119
escapades of every kind...

231
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,280
The idea to turn The Bay
into a luxury resort

232
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,639
was always doomed to failure

233
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,679
because, as you can see, dear lady,

234
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,800
this place is full of insects

235
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,880
I imagine that's why the two of you
came to live here then.

236
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,440
My husband believes that even
insects have a soul.

237
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,159
On the other hand,
if Filippo Donati has a soul,

238
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,079
insects also do.

239
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,719
Maybe Renata meant that you
settled here

240
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,119
for the natural life.

241
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,559
Natural or unnatural, one could even
kill one's wife

242
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,440
if it meant would one could
enjoy life more fully.

243
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,079
I came to find out
about my father's disappearance,

244
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,280
not to hear judgement passed on him.

245
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,159
I don't understand
what you're getting at.

246
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,599
Nothing.

247
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,159
Nothing, my dear lady.

248
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,840
I just hope you don't intend
to reopen the night club,

249
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,679
the gas station and all the other
devilries installed by your father

250
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,000
that have almost destroyed
the fauna here.

251
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:27,320
If you manage to inherit The Bay.

252
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,760
- Remember all that, Ferdinando?
- Ferdinando doesn't remember.

253
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,039
- Ferdinando doesn't remember...
- No!

254
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,320
Inheriting isn't so easy.

255
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Maybe Federica's will

256
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,280
leaves everything to
her biological son.

257
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,599
Biological son?

258
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,760
Yes! Federica did have
her brighter moments.

259
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,159
Didn't you know Simone is the fruit
of her secret love affair?

260
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,960
No, actually.
Who is this Simone?

261
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
He lives in a cabin by The Bay.

262
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,480
He's part watchman,
part woodsman, part petty thief.

263
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,679
- Anna!
- What?

264
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,400
He's a good chap, but lately
he's had some strange ideas.

265
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,440
Federica kept him in college
until he was 16.

266
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:32,000
Then she had him build that cabin
and kept him there like an animal.

267
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,039
A constant reminder
of her weak flesh.

268
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,119
Maybe he knows something
about my father.

269
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,320
I doubt it, he always avoided him.

270
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,719
He didn't approve of your father's
marriage to Federica.

271
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,360
But we should ask him
if he knows anything.

272
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,920
Maybe Franco Ventura
might know something.

273
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,440
He owns the cottage nearby.
He knows your father very well.

274
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,760
It's better not to take the car.

275
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,960
See that path?

276
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,639
lt'll take you straight there.

277
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,639
What did you do
to your hand?

278
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,719
I cut myself with the penknife.

279
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,000
Your father's disappearance wasn't
enough, now there's a son too!

280
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,960
We're even worse off
than before!

281
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,280
If you'd stop whining and use
your brain, you'd find a solution.

282
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,440
- There's no way out.
- There, you've already given up.

283
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,239
There's only one thing
between us and that inheritance.

284
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,840
- What?
- Nothing!

285
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,280
Okay, Simone, tomorrow...

286
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Go and see who they are!

287
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:43,960
Are you Simone?

288
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,840
No, everything's fine.

289
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,960
Tomorrow we'll celebrate together.

290
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:57,519
As soon as we get the go ahead,
I'll take a long holiday.

291
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,199
No, you've got to
keep things moving.

292
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,519
I can't right now.

293
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,400
Nothing,
just a little complication.

294
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,119
No, nothing serious.

295
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,320
Come on, don't start!

296
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,000
I said no!

297
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,360
Okay, get all the details
and I'll take care of it.

298
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,719
Okay...

299
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,440
Bye, squonk!

300
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,920
You don't remember
when you last saw Filippo Donati?

301
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:32,920
You must have had some
dealings with him.

302
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:36,960
You've lived here for years,
this isn't New York!

303
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:39,119
He was the owner of The Bay.

304
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,440
But you knew him, right?

305
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,320
You're a man of few words!

306
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,400
It's horrible! It's my father!

307
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,840
I feel sick!

308
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:09,000
I found him in the sea.

309
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,119
Take her to Ventura's cottage,
it's over there.

310
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,800
Mr Ventura!

311
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,480
Come on, calm down.

312
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,159
Looks like there's no one here.
How are you? Feeling better?

313
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,840
Get the car, hurry!

314
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,960
I heard your wife scream.

315
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:30,599
We found Donati's body.

316
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,039
- Where?
- In Simone's boat.

317
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:02,039
- Have you seen my wife?
- Down there, on the path.

318
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,440
That busybody! Anna!

319
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,239
Alberto! Come here, quick!

320
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,199
- Did you see?
- Yes, I did it.

321
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:24,119
- You did it?
- Why that face?

322
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,639
This isn't the right moment
to get all sensitive!

323
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,239
Stop that idiot before he calls
the police and ruins everything.

324
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,199
- But how?
- Go on, move it!

325
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,800
Go on, go!

326
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,440
Police...

327
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,880
332...

328
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,400
Three... three... two.

329
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,760
Hello? Police?

330
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:15,239
Three... three... two...

331
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:42,039
Give me a full tank.

332
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,599
- Is there a 'phone here?
- Yes, it's inside.

333
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,039
- Should I check the oil?
- Yes, thanks.

334
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,639
Stop yelling, are you crazy?

335
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,679
I killed him.

336
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:50,159
Those two could have saved
themselves...

337
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,079
...if they'd minded their own
business.

338
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,039
Now there are no more witnesses.

339
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,920
You mean that you...

340
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,920
- The wife too?
- Don't be such an old woman!

341
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:03,719
In certain situations
you have to act decisively.

342
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,239
Old woman?
I just killed a man!

343
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,480
Listen, let's get out of here.

344
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,360
Things will turn nasty.

345
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,519
If you're such a coward as to dump
everything on my shoulders, do it.

346
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,039
I won't give up The Bay
when it's ours for the taking.

347
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,000
But how?

348
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:26,599
Haven't you understood?

349
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:31,000
Simone!
We just have to get rid of Simone.

350
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,119
Who's that?

351
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,000
What if she saw us?

352
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:41,599
We'll do what we have to.

353
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:55,639
Laura!

354
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,719
- My God! What happened?
- Get Simone, quick.

355
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,880
- But you're wounded!
- Simone!

356
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:13,480
Bring Simone here, quick!

357
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:15,639
Don't waste time.

358
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:58,000
Ventura's wounded, quick!
He needs help!

359
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,199
- Why did you close it?
- You finally came back to The Bay.

360
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,840
What do you mean?

361
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:11,360
You convinced that bastard, Donati,
to kill my mother.

362
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:13,280
Your mother?

363
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:14,679
Me?

364
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:18,039
Don't play the innocent,
you whore!

365
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,679
Whore!

366
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,760
You drove him to murder!

367
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You wanted him
to marry you at all costs!

368
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,360
You wanted to become
Mistress of The Bay!

369
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,800
But now I'll you
like I killed him!

370
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,599
I had nothing to do with it!

371
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,960
I was dragged into this
against my will.

372
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,719
I didn't want to, let me explain.
I was forced!

373
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,440
It was Ventura, that's the truth.

374
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:55,039
It was all Ventura's idea.

375
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,840
He wanted to buy The Bay.

376
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:01,559
It seems immoral to let The Bay
disappear under the vegetation...

377
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,320
...when it could...
- Disappear under cement?

378
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:10,360
I already suffered enough
over The Bay.

379
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,119
I prefer the chaos of vegetation
over what you'd like to bring here.

380
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,840
But it's not for love of property
that I keep it.

381
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,000
If my house wasn't here,
I'd have sold The Bay long ago.

382
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:25,280
I assure you that I would retain
it's natural beauty.

383
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:28,440
I'd only build villas...
very exclusive, modern.

384
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:33,280
Your reasons are not sufficient
to convert me to modernism.

385
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:37,239
I already made the mistake
of entrusting The Bay

386
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,360
to someone with
a penchant for modernism.

387
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,440
Excuse me, but your husband...

388
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,480
I don't want to hear another word
about that man!

389
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,199
We could review the price
if that's the problem.

390
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:57,000
A gentleman would not insist
so much, Mr Ventura.

391
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,679
Excuse me,
it's time for my nap.

392
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,400
- Young lady...
- Countess...

393
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,360
Even the most stubborn
can be persuaded to think again.

394
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:30,599
"January 8th. I am now sure
that Filippo feels estranged from me.

395
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,360
I agreed to his project
for developing The Bay

396
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:37,360
in the hope of saving
our marriage.

397
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,519
Instead it's floundering."

398
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,119
Stop it, I don't care about
the Countess' love life.

399
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,840
Here! It was all over between them
on February 13th.

400
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,320
Listen.

401
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,960
"February 13th. It's over.

402
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:01,199
I'm tired,
my life has no purpose."

403
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,920
Poor thing!
She must have been devastated!

404
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,880
Read that page again.

405
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:14,960
"It's over. I'm tired,
my life has no purpose."

406
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,559
What is it?

407
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:26,079
February 13th...

408
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,599
Tell me, didn't Donati
once take a liking to you?

409
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,719
Don't be ridiculous.

410
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,199
I met him when you took me
to that night club at The Bay.

411
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,840
It's time to let him start courting
you again.

412
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,840
In fact, you're the one who'll
court him.

413
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:50,559
What do you intend to do?

414
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,159
It's simple.

415
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,320
Look.

416
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,880
What does it mean?

417
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:07,840
The Countess is tired of life
and commits suicide.

418
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,679
Suicide?

419
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,159
Yes.

420
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,480
On February 13th,
just like it says here.

421
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,920
On the night of the 13th,
Donati will kill the Countess.

422
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,119
The next day the body will be found
with a suicide note beside it.

423
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:30,719
Donati inherits the bay
and sells it to me.

424
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,199
Clear?

425
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:52,159
If Donati falls in love with you,
things could be a lot easier.

426
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,199
He pushed me into
seeing Donati.

427
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,880
Then Ventura intervened himself.

428
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,519
He was the one
who carried out the plan.

429
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,199
That bastard!

430
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:13,480
And you're worse than him!

431
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,479
I loved that poor cripple!

432
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,640
You killed her
for this shitty bay!

433
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,039
And me... I was stupid enough

434
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,600
to let you involve me
in your dirty deal.

435
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:31,000
I'll kill you!

436
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:33,000
Bastards!

437
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:34,840
I'll kill all of you!

438
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:25,680
<i>No! I said no!</i>

439
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,359
<i>You can't keep</i>
<i>teasing me like this!</i>

440
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,000
<i>I don't want to be</i>
<i>the other woman.</i>

441
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,479
<i>Get rid of Federica.</i>

442
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,840
<i>- Then we'll see.</i>
<i>- I thought about it, but...</i>

443
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:39,840
...<i>it's not that easy.</i>

444
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,560
<i>But it seems to be the only way.</i>

445
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,039
<i>So, will you do it?</i>

446
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:22,720
<i>I had to do it, they found</i>
<i>Donati's body.</i>

447
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,560
<i>You've got yourself into</i>
<i>some serious trouble.</i>

448
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,520
<i>Put them in the bathroom for now,</i>
<i>then we'll dump them in the sea.</i>

449
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,560
<i>You'd better get out of here,</i>
<i>go abroad!</i>

450
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,239
<i>Where will I get the money?</i>

451
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:40,760
<i>That can be arranged.</i>

452
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,520
<i>If you sign over The Bay to me,</i>
<i>you could get a loan.</i>

453
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:51,680
<i>But get me a copy of that will</i>
<i>so it's all above board.</i>

454
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,279
<i>Okay.</i>

455
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,000
<i>Here, sign.</i>

456
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,159
<i>Good. Tomorrow morning</i>
<i>you'll get your money,</i>

457
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:06,800
<i>air ticket and passport.</i>

458
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,439
<i>Thank you.</i>

459
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,800
There are two more things...

460
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:26,159
come on.

461
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,760
They're here, I've found them.

462
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:08,680
What's happening?

463
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,800
Renata, where are you?

464
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,880
Yes?

465
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,920
I didn't think you had it in you.

466
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:39,800
It's the least I could do
for my family.

467
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:42,520
We'd better clear out of here.

468
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:48,880
We'll come back as owners,
when The Bay is legally handed over.

469
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,760
It was lucky we found
my father's body.

470
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Now no one can accuse him
of being a murderer.

471
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:58,119
All's well that ends well!

472
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:02,079
Mummy! Daddy!

473
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,680
They're good at playing dead,
aren't they?

474
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:38,319
Let's go to the bay!
