1
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,445
"Welcome to Inveree"

2
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,199
Fuck!

3
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,035
Oh fuck, shit!

4
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,918
From the car off!

5
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,089
No, No, no, no, damn it,

6
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,677
Please not another,

7
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,939
Where did he go?

8
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,063
Who then?

9
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,942
The man you've just run over,

10
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,279
But apparently I did not,

11
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,194
And so there is no reason,
arrest me,

12
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,574
This is probably my lucky night,
-Meinst You?

13
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,285
Listen, I'm damn rights,

14
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,295
Not so hard! Tell Just,
that you would like to dominate,

15
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,629
then we take a room,

16
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,307
You know, handcuffs are at
the police here rather unusual,

17
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,516
Oh really? As a girl, I
a soft spot for wristbands,

18
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,400
"Missing"

19
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,281
Sergeant MacReady '?

20
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,494
They come with gifts?

21
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,339
Yes, My mother taught me,
never show up empty-handed,

22
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,666
Well that's all well before going on,

23
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,674
The young Caesar is one of our
Regular customers, do not you, boy?

24
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,173
Yes, but this is bullshit, Jim,
I did not do anything, I swear,

25
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,683
For you, Sergeant MacReady, boy,

26
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,054
And I am the way,
Constable Rachel Heggie,

27
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,108
But of course, They seem
yes to be quite eagerly,

28
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,106
The only question is, why you
are then stranded here?

29
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,239
We all have to start somewhere,
-Yes, And believe me,

30
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,113
from here it can only go up,

31
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,032
I have told you before,

32
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,415
Pass on what you say,
-Large God!

33
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,538
Also for you, do not take that tone, Thank You,

34
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,876
There are a few croutons for you here,
-Okay,

35
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,958
Then we want you times
message in the guestbook,

36
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,716
Yes!

37
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,974
Fuck! -I Am coming!
Still -Wait, I also equal!

38
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,482
Oh Man ,,,

39
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:25,032
I swear,
My Joanne was never so tight

40
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:30,032
even before she got the kids,
-The Makes the pelvic floor muscles, sweetheart,

41
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,156
Ready for another round? '

42
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,333
Oh fuck, give me a minute,

43
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,961
Lightweight,

44
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,498
Bitch,

45
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,176
How did you just call me?
-You Heard,

46
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,554
Bitch,

47
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,301
Mother's again,

48
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:01,690
So then:Francis Sargison,
also known as Caesar,

49
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,197
Again a joyride, yes?
-But This time without fun,

50
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,821
And your driver's license?

51
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,038
He almost killed someone,
Ah, no, I have not,

52
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,369
Where is the victim?
-Good That you ask, Caesar,

53
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,088
That's what I'll find out
while you strip,

54
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,174
Hop hop!

55
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,224
Mundie ,,, come on down!

56
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,936
I think we'd better back,

57
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,062
Come on,

58
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,240
You animal!

59
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:01,586
Ah, it goes straight to the point,
Let the prelude from simple?

60
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,884
This will now be under profiling, Sarge,
I'm prejudiced here,

61
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,132
If you were part of a minority,
Who would you maybe interested in,

62
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,177
Here is the squad leader,
Are you there, people?

63
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,600
<I> Warnock? Mundie? </ I>

64
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,270
Present, Sarge, Loud and clear,

65
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,981
Here someone wants to say "hello",

66
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,207
Hi folks, here speaks
Constable Rachel Heggie,

67
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,580
Please keep your eyes open
for a man - White,

68
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,330
<I> 1 meter 80, beard and
likely to be injured, Thank you! </ I>

69
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,351
We should also contact the local
Hospitals check,

70
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,849
"Prisoner file"

71
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,432
"Date of Birth:05/10/1957
Occupation:Teacher "

72
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,059
"Chronicle:Domestic violence currently
Domestic violence - 07,14,2014 "

73
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,910
Sir?

74
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,326
Sergeant MacReady '?

75
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,499
Seriously, Constable, you are sure
They form is not an all?

76
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,377
There was blood on the headlights, sir,
Well no,

77
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,469
I would like to have the car checked,
if we had a victim, Is that so?

78
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,698
I set up shop under control,
In most cases, it is quiet here,

79
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,201
What do you mean?
-How They say:

80
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,288
Without victim no crime,

81
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,958
I told you,
I've told you,

82
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,373
Oh God,
Sorry, what was that? '

83
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,080
<I> Sierra One, what exactly do you mean by </ i>

84
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,877
"White"? Shall we now have a
Search fucking snowman?

85
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,347
Flap! Makes your job and find him,

86
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,225
Yes, sir, Sarge, We keep our eyes open,

87
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,310
It's just ,,,

88
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,148
<I> sounds as fun to
can be as suspect their testimony, </ i>

89
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,565
That's enough!

90
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,983
Please bring us even with a coffee,
We sit on dry land,

91
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
Do you want anything?

92
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,535
Except that confidential documents
be treated as such?

93
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,786
No,

94
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,078
Yeah, good luck with that,

95
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,081
Even at the local nail salon
hear less gossip than here,

96
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,159
Hello?

97
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,165
Hello?

98
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,249
Can I smoke a lot
before I get involved?

99
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,884
Here's smoking ban,
-Is This a joke?

100
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,176
Your room, sir,

101
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,351
Have fun with the free
Skid marks on the pillow,

102
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,228
I had half a box
Cigarettes when I came here,

103
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,981
That was all counted accurately,
-Now Tell me you suspect

104
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,891
that we steal your butts,

105
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,644
He assumed it,

106
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,280
He will be assumed
you steal his butts,

107
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,531
A spokesman assumed
a listener suspected,

108
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,198
The one place where it is felt
To be sure - and there he is,

109
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,035
Something you have to swallow, Caesar,

110
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,500
Is nice if you have more time than
than at school want to spend,

111
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,504
We thought we doing you a favor
and bring the school to you,

112
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,383
Why is he here?

113
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,888
Because he just like his women
likes his whiskey - 12 Years Old?

114
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,721
Constable Heggie, Mr, Beswick,

115
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,733
You complain yet
constantly about class sizes,

116
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,781
This is our way to help
with some private lessons,

117
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,324
That's it, right? He is a fanatic,

118
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,378
I knew it, Dirty pervert,

119
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,963
Go back, away from the door,
-How's It twice with "please", bitch?

120
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,054
What the hell? That's assault,

121
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,844
Man, fuck brutality!

122
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,435
Just do it,
what is said to you, bitch,

123
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,522
Okay, all right,

124
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,152
You saw that, right?
You are my witness,

125
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,360
She was trying to break my arm,
-I Have not seen anything,

126
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,904
Oh come on, wake up!
If we approach this correctly,

127
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,985
we are still before the last
Round out here,

128
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,329
You simply have to say,
what you have seen,

129
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,916
I'll sue you, and this
Be photographed scratches,

130
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,541
Sometimes, Francis,
need to be disciplined people,

131
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,125
This preserves the natural order,

132
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,332
Is that what you did? '

133
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,546
I have read the file,

134
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,715
Pretty dirty,
how to maintain order, right?

135
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,394
Well, every story has two sides,
-sure, Of course,

136
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,348
Yours is certainly true maudlin,

137
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:13,204
So one, my boy, is commonly
known as a wire brush,

138
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,343
The salvage people do not respond,
I need to call a tow truck later,

139
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,509
Provoke getting your prisoner?

140
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,313
In fact, I do not even smoke,

141
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,315
Types such as Caesar come with
Authority not well understood,

142
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,904
So I use a number
different methods,

143
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,782
And cell 4?

144
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,119
He seems pretty convinced of
Ralph?

145
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,407
This man needs a sandbag,

146
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,997
His wife is for all
certainly not suitable,

147
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,880
He is also a regular guest here?
-You Can set the clock after,

148
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,125
And I guarantee that it tomorrow
early the charges will drop,

149
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,466
Unfortunately, a widespread problem,

150
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,723
If there is abuse in relationships,

151
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,051
Oh, that's so, Constable?

152
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,479
The little girl,
the back, came here,

153
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,610
The world is full of evil,
That goes double for police stations,

154
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,912
Hey, hey, calm, buddy, This way,

155
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,291
<I> Hey, Sarge? We found him, </ I>

156
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,998
Ah, you must be the new one,

157
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,216
Mundie,

158
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,506
We've known,
I ,,, just kidding, you know?

159
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,389
Good work, Mundie,

160
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,187
Heggie? Warnock,

161
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,268
Is that him? 1 meter 80, beard,
pretty spaced out,

162
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,481
Yes, he is,

163
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,109
They are straight before
run a car, what?

164
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,124
He has a blow off in any case,
When we found him, he wandered around,

165
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,875
He was right in front of us,

166
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,957
and then just go away,

167
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,386
Probably due to the adrenaline,
-Yes, But adrenaline decreases,

168
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,139
Better call to Dr, Hume,
His number is on the wall,

169
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,886
What is your name, sir?

170
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,729
Cosy chat is
not with him, Sarge,

171
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,941
Hi, I'm calling from the police station,

172
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,319
We have an injured person here
the medical needs help,

173
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,316
Your name, my friend?

174
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,571
Honestly, I think,
from having a bit of a wheel, boss,

175
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,031
It looks like a
From concussion,

176
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,449
Thank You,
-What's Your name?

177
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,216
And the first in your day,

178
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,885
I tell you so that uniform does it,

179
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,609
It thus seems women
Uniform to like what?

180
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,907
Looks like,

181
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,033
To me it's better if they only
Handcuffs and the hat wearing,

182
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,950
but anyway ,,,

183
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,460
Do I have to tie you about?

184
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,836
Space, boy,

185
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,593
Now let us all Medical Play, yes?

186
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,682
Where is he?

187
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,226
To the patient, please click here along, Doctor,

188
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,729
Its injuries seem
just to be on the outside,

189
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,695
No evidence of toxicity,

190
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,534
So he has a clear head?

191
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,207
He definitely has something about him,

192
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,711
So I would say "yes",
His silence could be voluntary,

193
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,167
Then he comes over night in a cell,

194
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,046
Why that? His refusal to talk about?

195
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,181
Well then we just vagrancy,

196
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,559
In addition, he is tonight
went before a car, right?

197
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,895
Until you his identity
have found

198
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,315
it is probably best if he stays here,

199
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,892
Have you found a name, Constable?

200
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,647
No, No wallet, no ID,
no phone, no key,

201
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,983
Only this book, which is full of names,

202
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,406
Just what is his?

203
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:06,201
If any, Maybe he just
only the phonebook depreciated,

204
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,952
There is something compulsive,

205
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,880
There are small icons, small characters,
It must have a meaning for him,

206
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,340
I told you so,
the guy has a Hau away,

207
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,388
Since you can sometimes nice
determine Heggie, right?

208
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,142
Find out! Try it
times during the pat mills,

209
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,970
Maybe even a missing security wing
his diarist,

210
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,939
So I got him safely
never seen before,

211
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,604
What is unusual,
in such a small town here,

212
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,818
And damn lifeless it is,

213
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,786
I beg your pardon? What did he just say?

214
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,616
Doctor Hume?

215
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,361
He knows it,
-What Does he know?

216
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,241
Everything,

217
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,415
What does he know, Duncan?
What does he know?

218
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,618
So, so, Doctor Hume,

219
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,197
He's here to view our
To cure diseases,

220
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,368
What is it, Doctor? Are you here,
to investigate my wrist?

221
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,210
Go back cushion Hume,
-From Moral superiority

222
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,875
You are here below all
far away, Doctor,

223
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,052
But we all make mistakes, right?

224
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,051
Take care of your stuff, Beswick,
-Oh, I will, if he does it well,

225
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,894
But if I can not stand one
then a hypocrite,

226
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,642
How do you explain your
Presence tonight?

227
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,311
An whopping Swatter for Mr, Beswick!
-And What brings you this? '

228
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,395
I could watch,

229
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,152
And now have a cool little
Story for all my friends,

230
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,151
Threaten you about me, Francis?
-I Name is Caesar,

231
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,822
And no, I open
only the discussion,

232
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,872
what my silence you and the
good doctor could be whom,

233
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,042
You know, maybe I am
not literate,

234
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,708
Mr, Beswick, but I ,,,
-You Are not smart, Caesar,

235
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,678
You're an idiot,

236
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,051
So just sit back,

237
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,178
Keep your mouth shut

238
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,094
and listen to flush out the wildlife,

239
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,157
She used it for a can of cider and
made a thumb in the ass with everyone,

240
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,079
The evolutionary ladder climbs up
not saying anything, boy?

241
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,280
Small, sticky fingers,

242
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,854
So, according to our records
and your fingerprints

243
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,074
Are you Alexander Monroe from Port Glasgow,

244
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,578
And you are died in 1983,
In a fire

245
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,323
at the age of 79 years,

246
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,704
I must say you look healthy from, Al,

247
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,128
The advantage of a clear conscience,

248
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,093
And this

249
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,550
is applied modern policing,

250
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,216
Technology, completely unreliable,

251
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,929
But tonight we
proceed according to the old school,

252
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,314
Keep it up, then make
we really "perhaps,

253
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,782
Okay,

254
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,908
Let's forget for a minute
who you are, and ask why,

255
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,240
For example, why did you
Doctor Hume attacked?

256
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,585
Because the clock is ticking and midnight approaches,

257
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,254
He said, "you know it,"

258
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,832
What exactly do you know?

259
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,848
That the price of our
Sins are paid for with blood,

260
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,977
And I ,,,

261
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,188
"That I must be unsteady on earth,"

262
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,401
"And that slay me,
whoever finds me, "

263
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,607
I meant,

264
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,571
One common feature,

265
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,666
We are both Christians,
-Only That you have more to

266
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,127
Old Testament tend, right?

267
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,168
The blood and vengeance,

268
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,556
The sweat

269
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,846
and the sperm,

270
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,720
I can smell it,

271
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,894
I must say that I know
not from the Sunday School,

272
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,981
I just do not - but I
am also exited,

273
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,444
So do not believe in God?
-That I did not say that,

274
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,326
But I would like damn
some say talk to him,

275
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,696
It is not for us,
after asking why,

276
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:05,124
No! Because we can do here
what we want, right?

277
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,678
Create it away,

278
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,219
Get him down!

279
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,010
Coffins, I do not think so ,,,
Right Away!

280
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,711
Oh wonderful! I just wanted to
ask up to a round of tea,

281
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,125
Can it be that I'm above a
Pack of chocolate biscuits've seen?

282
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,688
Listen, should tomorrow morning
You have to be out here, okay?

283
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,874
Mundie?

284
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:38,879
You damned ,,,

285
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,444
Good God, are you okay?

286
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,908
So who's the first?

287
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,291
Hey, Hey, are you okay?
-Let It!

288
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,042
It was nothing, Leave me alone!

289
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,968
This "we have two girls
hold together number you can bend,

290
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,846
You and I are not friends,

291
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,549
We are nothing,

292
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,530
Still busy with Mrs, Hume, Sarge,

293
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,199
Sarge?

294
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,414
It is now more than
an hour on the phone,

295
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:39,000
The whole world could
Expert ability of these women testify,

296
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,590
Driving times out and take with Jen,

297
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,219
"Her husband is in prison"
is personally getting better,

298
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,347
I think it is better,
if you do tell her, Sarge,

299
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,596
I need to do some research here,

300
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,730
Let's see if I can not figure out
who our top crafty friend really is,

301
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,736
Rachel,

302
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,023
You stay here and make
for us patrols,

303
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,158
Drink tea,
answer the phone,

304
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,575
bake a cake,

305
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,823
Make just stay out of trouble, okay?
-Sir, Do you really think it's smart,

306
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,874
a single police officer with four
To let prisoners alone?

307
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,703
As long as you do not all
for a finger food buffet

308
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,422
and a few rounds Bridge let out,
I mean even know this was possible,

309
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,713
I am aware that you think, we live
here all in a fucking cookie jar,

310
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,472
But the fact is that you made me a
very good reason have been allocated,

311
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,395
I say this only once
for the cheap seats:

312
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,100
If you want to survive the probationary period,

313
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,106
you will learn to sit still,

314
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,272
To curb your temper

315
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,653
and to keep your damn mouth,

316
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:48,618
Got it?

317
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,878
<I> 25 </ i> years, I have never seen such a
blatant insubordination experienced,

318
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:08,263
"Missing"

319
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,020
We find that here is very convenient -
curb to the temperament,

320
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,861
Hilarious,

321
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,108
The Sarge has been right,

322
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,035
You have at your social
Skills to work,

323
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,156
I will definitely
take with you lessons,

324
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,242
Just call your friend on,

325
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,287
Thank you, I can do without it,

326
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,840
Okay, well then have fun
with the crossword puzzle,

327
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,097
On the one bites from the teeth,

328
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,019
Night,

329
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,385
I am very sure that you
provide a few more eggs,

330
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,588
I do not want my French
Waive toast, not because of you,

331
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:18,894
Who knows, maybe we are
tomorrow morning no longer here,

332
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,393
Sure, of course, Have a
Escape plan or something?

333
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,062
I thought you were the one
digging the tunnel,

334
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,062
I decorate just my cell, man,

335
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,194
Maybe you should learn first time,
how do you spell that, Francis,

336
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:36,112
But that would mean that I time
spend in school - with you,

337
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,827
And yet we're stuck here together firmly,

338
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,117
in the midst of offenders,

339
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,004
Right there you are also out -

340
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,293
Mr, Beswick,

341
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,636
How do you know my name?

342
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:57,932
What do you think?

343
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,997
"David Brundridge (the acid bath killer):
deceased "

344
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:23,852
"Bryan Heffington (the whale):
deceased "

345
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,290
<I> Wait until morning, </ I>

346
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,537
