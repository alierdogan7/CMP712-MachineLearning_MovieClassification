Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:04,766
Aaron: My name is Aaron...

3
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:08,070
Sasha: He has a camp, he wants
us to audition for membership.

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,271
Aaron: If we found a group,

5
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:12,691
we wanted to be able to bring
them all home.

6
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:14,242
There's enough room
for all of us.

7
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,079
Michonne: We need this.
So we're going.

8
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:19,114
All of us.

9
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:22,951
Rick Grimes: Some time tonight
we'll be outside his camp's walls,

10
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:26,288
I'm going to have to decide
whether to bring my family in.

11
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:29,558
I'm not sure if anything can
convince me to go in there.

12
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:58,053

14
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,570
We brought dinner.

15
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,409
Aaron:
<i>It's okay.</i>

16
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:22,828
Come on in, guys.

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,948
Before we take this any further, I need
you all to turn over your weapons.

18
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,368
Stay, you hand them over.

19
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,454
We don't know
if we want to stay.

20
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:07,339
It's fine, Nicholas.

21
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:10,792
If we were gonna use them, we
would have started already.

22
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,961
Aaron: <i>Let them talk
to Deanna first.</i>

23
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,513
Who's Deanna?

24
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:17,299
She knows everything you'd
want to know about this place.

25
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,853
Rick, why don't you start?

26

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,226

(gunshot)

29
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,491
It's a good thing we're here.

Hello.

00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:33,936
I'm Deanna Monroe.

Rick Grimes.

35
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:38,820
- You mind if I film this?
- What?

36
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,643
Do you mind if I film our talk?

37
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,779
Go ahead.

38
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:49,290
- Rick:<i> Why film this?</i>

Deanna: <i>We're about
transparency here.</i>

40
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:58,433
Please.

41
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,268
<i>How long have you</i>
<i>been out there?</i>

42
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,220
Since the beginning.

43
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,721
<i>How did you all find each other?</i>

44
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,273
<i>Did you know each other</i>
<i>before or--?</i>

45
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,392
We didn't know
each other before.

46
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,819
I was a congressperson.

47
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,955
Ohio, 15th district.

48
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:23,074
You?

49
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,159
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it matters anymore.</i>

50
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:26,794
Oh, I know it does.

51
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:30,331
What is this place?

52
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,251
This is the start
of sustainability.

53
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,720
That's what the brochures
we found say.

54
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,056
This was a planned community

55
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:41,759
with its own solar grid,
cisterns,

56
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:44,596
eco-based
sewage filtration.

57
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:47,932
Starting in the low 800,000s...

58
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,935
(laughs)
...if there is such a thing.

59
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:52,854
And they sold them all.

60
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:54,572
How did you end up here?

61
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,358
Well, my family and I were
trying to get back to Ohio

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,445
so I could help my district
manage the crisis.

63
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,530
And...

64
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:05,116
(sighs) ...the army
stopped us on a back road

65
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,452
and directed us here.

66
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:09,454
They were supposed
to come later.

67
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,790
They didn't.

68
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,179
But there were supplies here

69
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:20,298
and we made the best of it.

70
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,767
You put up the wall?

71
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,970
Well, there was
this huge shopping mall

72
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,972
being built nearby.

73
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:30,942
And my husband Reg is a
professor of architecture.

74
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:36,564
And who he was
mattered quite a bit.

75
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,983
He got the first plates up
with our sons.

76
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:43,821
And after a few weeks,
more people arrived

77
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,624
and we had help.

78
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,459
We had a community.

79
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:52,664
You've been behind these
walls this entire time?

80
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,802
We need people who have
lived out there.

81
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:00,388
Your group is the first
we've even considered

82
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,724
taking in for a long time.

83
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,343
You should keep
your gates closed.

84
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,263
Why?

85
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:14,852
Because it's all
about survival now.

86
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:16,437
At any cost.

87
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:21,826
People out there are always
looking for an angle.

88
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,328
Looking to play
on your weakness.

89
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,366
They measure you

90
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:31,869
by what they can take from you.

91
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:34,756
By how they can use you to live.

92
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:41,045
So bringing people into
a place like this now--

93
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,382
Are you telling me
not to bring your people in?

94
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:47,719
Are you already
looking after this place?

95
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,474
<i>Aaron says I can trust you.</i>

96
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,526
Aaron doesn't know me.

97
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,278
I've killed people.

98
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,482
I don't even know
how many by now.

99
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:05,737
But I know why they're all dead.

100
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,290
They're dead so my family,

101
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:12,577
all those people
out there, can be alive.

102
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,079
So I could be alive for them.

103
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,751
Sounds like I'd want
to be part of your family.

104
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:26,007
Rick,

105
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,010
northern Virginia was
effectively evacuated.

106
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:32,146
Millions of people gone.

107
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:34,432
For a long time, there's
hardly been anyone here,

108
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,684
living or dead, but still...

109
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,905
we have lost people.

110
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:44,776
And...

111
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,944
I've done things.

112
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:51,282
What have you done?

113
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:57,255
I exiled three men
who didn't work out.

114
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,457
And we both know that's
as good as killing them.

115
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:05,880
What do you want from us?

116
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,851
These families...

117
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,140
these families should be
able to raise their children

118
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,692
in a safe environment.

119
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:21,279
Your son, your daughter,

120
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:24,615
should have a place to grow up.

121
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,400
What do I want?

122
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:31,706
I want you to help us survive.

123
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,742
I know you can help us do that.

124
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,379
How?

125
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,801
I am exceptionally good
at reading people.

126
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:47,004
If I didn't win reelection,

127
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,507
I was gonna be a
professional poker player.

128
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,008
(scoffs)

129
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,844
I'm not kidding.

130
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,680
Rick...

131
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,851
it's 3:37 P.M.

132
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,187
You're skeptical.

133
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,826
You have a right to be.

134
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,413
But it's time to decide

135
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:14,782
if you're the one
who's doing the deciding.

136
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,964
I was a sheriff.

137
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:37,772
<i>Yeah, I knew it was</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

138
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,708
They're still your guns. You can check
them out whenever you go beyond the wall.

139
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:52,328
But inside here,
we store them for safety.

140
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:19,222
Should have brought another bin.

141
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:29,983
- Both of 'em?
- At your disposal.

142
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:32,819
I'd call dibs on that one.

143
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:35,572
It's got more curb appeal.

144
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:40,376
Listen, I know you're
still feeling us out,

145
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,829
but I'm glad you came.

146
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:46,499
Anyway, Deanna's asked everyone
to give you your space

147
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,551
so they aren't all
coming at you at once.

148
00:10:48,553 --> 00:10:52,505
Take your time.
Explore.

149
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,924
You need anything, you call me.

150
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:59,145
I don't-- we don't
have phones.

151
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,265
I-- I meant...
I'm four houses down.

152
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:04,684
- Thank you.
- So...

153
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,012

154
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,614
<i>(knocking)</i>

155
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:54,544
Hey.
I work in the pantry.

156
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:56,963
Deanna asked me to bring these
over for you and your friends.

157
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,135
Thank you.

158
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,971
We're just cleaning up.

159
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,522
I can see that.

160
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:09,475
You still have some shaving
cream on your chin.

161
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:14,397
I'm Jessie.

162
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,317
(sighs)
Rick.

163
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:21,204
You know, I used
to be a stylist.

164
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:23,539
And 12 other things.

165
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,825
I could give you
a cut if you want.

166
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,330
You don't even know me.

167
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,334
I can take care of myself.

168
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,339
I have two boys, Ron and Sam.

169
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:45,061
Ron's my oldest boy.
He's about your son's age.

170
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,512
I could introduce them.

171
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:49,349
- If that's okay with you and--
- It's just me.

172
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:53,603
No, that'd be--
that'd be great.

173
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,857
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:05,114
Electricity, showers,

175
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,283
haircuts--

176
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I never thought
I'd see those again.

177
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,873
Come on.

178
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,626
Haircuts were never going away.

179
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,131
It's okay if you're
not okay with this yet.

180
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,606
That's better.

181
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:42,568
Deanna: <i>You're welcome
to sit, Daryl.</i>

182
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,570
I won't bite.

183
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,122
Yeah, I'm all right.

184
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,993
Daryl, do you want to be here?

185
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:56,632
The boy and the baby,

186
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,085
they deserve a roof.

187
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:02,755
I guess.

188
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,318
You can look.
Just be quick.

189
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,019
Okay.

190
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,675
These are like mansions.

191
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:43,129
Mm-hmm. And they're
just giving them away.

192
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,384
You coming?

193
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,636
Yeah, in a sec.

194
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,820
They're right next
to each other, but--

195
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,540
They took our weapons and now
they're splitting us up.

196
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

197
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:16,662
We'll all be staying
in the same house tonight.

198
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,000
<i>(thumping, wood creaking)</i>

199
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,603
<i>(thumping)</i>

200
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:47,637
<i>(Michonne sighs)</i>

201
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:50,756
How long was I in there for?

202
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,258
Rick:
<i>20 minutes.</i>

203
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,727
God, I could not stop brushing.

204
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,766
Huh.

205
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,852
I've never--

206
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,604
I've never seen
your face like that.

207
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:07,440
That's what I felt
before and after.

208
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:11,077
Look...

209
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,080
I get why we're playing it safe.

210
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:15,665
We should.

211
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,284
I just--

212
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:22,538
I have a good feeling
about this place.

213
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,008
Well, I hope you're right.

214
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,545
Yeah, me, too.

215
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:31,631
<i>(knocking)</i>

216
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:35,968
Rick, I--

217
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:39,605
- Wow.
- (groans)

218
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:42,608
I didn't know
what was under there.

219
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,394
Listen, I don't
mean to interrupt.

220
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:48,064
I just wanted to stop by and
see how you were all settling.

221
00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:52,652
<i>Oh, my.</i>

222
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:56,322
Staying together.

223
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:57,823
<i>Smart.</i>

224
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:59,742
Rick:
<i>No one said we couldn't.</i>

225
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:02,745
You said you're a family.
That's what you said.

226
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:07,166
<i>Absolutely amazing</i>
<i>to me how people</i>

227
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,085
<i>with completely</i>
<i>different backgrounds</i>

228
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:12,054
<i>and nothing in common</i>
<i>can become that.</i>

229
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:13,973
<i>Don't you think?</i>

230
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,009
Everybody said
you gave them jobs.

231
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:19,061
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

232
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:21,514
Part of this place.

233
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:24,233
Looks like the communists
won after all.

234
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:27,019
Well, you didn't give me one.

235
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:29,021
I have.

236
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:32,441
I just haven't told you yet.

237
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,099
Same with Michonne.

238
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,197
<i>I'm closing in on</i>
<i>something for Sasha.</i>

239
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:42,034
And I'm just trying to figure Mr.
Dixon out, but I will.

240
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:46,706
You look good.

241
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,088
If this is how
you're saying it is...

242
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:48,726
then this is what we wanted.

243
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,897
We're ready for this.

244
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,017
Deanna:
<i>All of you?</i>

245
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,019
(sighs)

246
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,022
All of us.

247
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,694
They said explore.

248
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:08,696
Let's explore.

249
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:10,665
Nah, I'll stay.

250
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:14,618
All right.

251
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:24,211
Lori and me,

252
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:27,214
we used to drive through
neighborhoods like this.

253
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:30,851
Thinking, "One day..."

254
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:34,722
Well, here we are.

255
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,728
We'll be back.

256
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,532
- Come on. Come on.
- (laughing)

257
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,058
(clatters)

258
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,510
Rick, you okay?

259
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:14,011
Did Carl and Judith walk by?

260
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:16,597
We were out and they
were ahead of me.

261
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,816
It's okay. I think I
know where they are.

262
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:24,488
That's Natalie and Bob Miller.

263
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,108
They had five kids
and 12 grandkids.

264
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:33,080
It's been a long time since anyone
around here has seen a baby.

265
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:35,199
She's gonna have to put up
with some pinched cheeks.

266
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,785
Thanks.
I just, um--

267
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,171
It's okay.
I get it.

268
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:49,880
Look, I'm sorry I broke
whatever that was I broke.

269
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:52,716
It's a sculpture
I'm making with the boys.

270
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:54,218
It's an owl.

271
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,637
I mean, it will be.

272
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,355
I just can't get the eyes right.

273
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,608
Right, the eyes.

274
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,276
You didn't even get
a good look at it.

275
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:04,645
(sighs)

276
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,064
I was in the middle
of losing my mind.

277
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,033
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

278
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:13,988
Hey, Rick.

279
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,707
Would it be okay
if Carl came over now?

280
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,325
Ron really wants to meet him.

281
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:27,218
Ron:<i> We're almost always here after
school, so you can come by any time.</i>

282
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,170
You go to school?

283
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:31,338
It's in a garage.

284
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,840
Little kids go in the morning

285
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,508
and then it's us
in the afternoon.

286
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,594
Probably you, too, right?

287
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,345
Probably.

288
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:41,932
Guys, this is Carl.

289
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:44,852
Carl, this is Mikey and Enid.

290
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:46,854
Hey.

291
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,939
Hi.

292
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:50,941
Enid's from outside, too.

293
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,776
She just came eight months ago.

294
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,363
Oh, um...

295
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:58,699
is this yours?

296
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,534
Sorry.

297
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:02,870
We didn't know you guys
got that house.

298
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:05,589
We mostly just hang out
there and listen to music.

299
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:06,874
That's Enid's.

300
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,682
Want to play some video games?

301
00:24:14,684 --> 00:24:16,851
Or Mikey's house
has a pool table,

302
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:19,470
but his dad's
kind of strict about it.

303
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:21,722
It's okay.
He's at work.

304
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,727
Um...

305
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,235
Sorry, I guess we
come on kind of strong.

306
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:37,037
<i>We can just hang out.</i>

307
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,123
Mikey: <i>You don't even have
to talk if you don't wanna.</i>

308
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,743
Ron: <i>Yeah, took Enid three
weeks to say something.</i>

309
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:47,047
Pull it together, sport.

310
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:52,136
Let's, um--

311
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:53,837
let's play some video games.

312
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,391
Ron:
<i>Cool, yeah.</i>

313
00:24:57,393 --> 00:25:00,427
This is the kind of place
my mom wanted for us.

314
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:03,764
Deanna:
<i>I'm sorry you lost her.</i>

315
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:07,985
I didn't just lose her.

316
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:11,272
I killed her.

317
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,776
It had to be me.

318
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,661
Hey.

319
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:21,248
How was Ron's house?

320
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,451
What do you think of this place?

321
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:28,455
Well, I think it seems...

322
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,959
nice.

323
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:33,711
Yeah.

324
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:35,963
I like it here.

325
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:37,464
I like the people.

326
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:40,968
<i>But they're weak.</i>

327
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,220
And I don't want us
to get weak, too.

328
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:46,690
Hmm.

329
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:14,885
Deanna hasn't
given me a job yet.

330
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:16,670
You want one?

331
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,341
Yeah.

332
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:23,394
Do you?

333
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:26,013
That's signing the papers.

334
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:29,600
That's saying yes,
this is how it is.

335
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,185
You afraid to do that?

336
00:26:31,187 --> 00:26:33,654
Aren't you?

337
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:35,773
No.

338
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,611
So then why are we both awake?

339
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,038
I'm gonna take a walk.

340
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:08,222
Man:
<i>You're Rick.</i>

341
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,895
Yeah.

342
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:18,449
My wife cut your hair.

343
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:22,202
Yeah.

344
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,709
Welcome to Alexandria.

345
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:52,016
I did laundry, gardened, um...

346
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:55,306
always had dinner
on the table for Ed

347
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:56,765
when he came home.

348
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,723
Um...

349
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:03,788
I miss that stupid,
wonderful man every day.

350
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:08,426
You know, I really didn't have
much to offer this group,

351
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:10,879
so I think I just sort of
became their den mother.

352
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:13,381
And they've been
nice enough to protect me.

353
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:17,936
Deanna: <i>Where do you
think you'll fit in?</i>

354
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:20,772
Oh, um, hmm.

355
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,609
Well, I'd like to be involved
in the community.

356
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:26,644
Do you have anything
like a Junior League?

357
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:28,813
I'm a real people person.

358
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:32,617
Ow.

359
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:34,702
<i>(door opens)</i>

360
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,658
Time to punch the clock
and make the casseroles.

361
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,160
What?

362
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:44,045
Make dinner
for the older people--

363
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:47,332
moms who need a break,
people who can't cook.

364
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,584
Get to meet a lot
of the neighbors that way.

365
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:51,970
(scoffs)
All right.

366
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:53,755
Have you taken a shower yet?

367
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,890
Mm-hmm.

368
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:58,059
Take a shower.
I'm gonna wash that vest.

369
00:28:58,061 --> 00:29:00,395
We need to keep up
appearances, even you.

370
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,230
Hey, I ain't starting now.

371
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:04,148
I'm gonna hose you
down in your sleep.

372
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,436
You look ridiculous.

373
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:10,571
We need to make this work.

374
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:13,942
Deanna:
<i>Why?</i>

375
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:17,829
'Cause...

376
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:21,616
we were almost
out there too long.

377
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:47,585
Glenn, Tara, Noah?

378
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:50,088
Nice to meet you.
I'm Aiden.

379
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,873
You met Nicholas
pulling gate duty.

380
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,591
- Nicholas:<i> Hey.</i>
- You're Deanna's son?

381
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,878
That's right. I hear you got
experience making supply runs.

382
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,014
I saw your pantry. You guys
seem to do pretty well.

383
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:03,601
Yeah, well, had some
training before this. ROTC.

384
00:31:03,603 --> 00:31:06,270
Was nearing lieutenant
when this shit blew in.

385
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:09,474
- My dad did ROTC.
- He didn't make it?

386
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:12,527
Nah.

387
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,696
I'm sorry.

388
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,484
I'm sorry a lot these days.

389
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,702
Come on, I'll show
you the ropes.

390
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:23,571
We're doing a run today?

391
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,657
Just a dry run.

392
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:30,128
Show you the terrain outside
the walls, see how you do.

393
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,497
Weigh each other's sack
a little, you know?

394
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:36,134
No, I don't, but cool.

395
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:38,302
- What about weapons?
-<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

396
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:41,923
We pulled out some sweet-ass
biscuits for today.

397
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:18,009
<i>(distant metal clanging)</i>

398
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:46,120
- (metal clanging)
- (snarling)

399
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:07,558
(snarling)

400
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:37,205
<i>(walkers snarling)</i>

401
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:16,160
Get ready.

402
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:36,814
Dad.

403
00:34:56,171 --> 00:34:58,889
Aiden: We've been increasing
our radius mile by mile,

404
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:02,059
spreading in a semicircle
around the town.

405
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:05,896
Nicholas: We've made it
53 miles out so far.

406
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:09,149
Aiden: We break into two groups
when we step outside our vehicle.

407
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,351
If shit hits, we fire a flare.

408
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:13,687
One group gets the other.

409
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,656
Noah:
Good system.

410
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:18,025
It is.

411
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:20,827
Still, you're standing here because
we lost four people last month.

412
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,913
What happened?

413
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:26,583
Aiden: <i>We were on a
run, roamers came out,</i>

414
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,251
<i>they didn't follow the system.</i>

415
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:30,620
They were good people.

416
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:32,956
They were.

417
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,509
They were just scared.

418
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:39,796
Look, I can be
a hard-ass.

419
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:42,632
And I know I'm a douchebag.

420
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:44,885
Someone's got to call
the ball around here

421
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:47,437
and that someone is me.

422
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,640
If you're on this crew,
you do exactly as I say.

423
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:53,527
Sorry you lost your people.

424
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,780
Yeah.
We got ours.

425
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,234
Managed to snag one of the
deadheads that took them down.

426
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,070
Strung it up there.

427
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:06,206
What? Why?

428
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,492
Now we have a little
pregame ritual.

429
00:36:08,494 --> 00:36:10,794
Get our heads on straight.

430
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:12,996
Remind us what we're up against.

431
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:15,248
(flies buzzing)

432
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,718
Son of a bitch!

433
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,336
Help me find it.

434
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:21,588
Look at this shit.

435
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,141
Blood's still wet.
It's nearby.

436
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,727
- (whistles)
- Shh!

437
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:29,679
Hey-- hey, hey.
It's gone.

438
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,598
It took down one of our friends.

439
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,150
It's nearby, we're not
letting it go.

440
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,985
(whistles)

441
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:37,437
-<i> (clapping) Hey!</i>
- (snarling)

442
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:40,107
Hey, over here.
Come on. Come on.

443
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:42,743
Hey, come on.
Come at me.

444
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,828
- No, don't touch it.
- The rest of you, back off.

445
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,413
Come on. Come on.
Come here.

446
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:49,699
Come on. Come on.
Come on now. Come on!

447
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,620
<i>Get him.</i>

448
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:55,705
Damn it!

449
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:04,464
Aiden:
<i>No, hold on to it!</i>

450
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:13,640
- What the hell?!
- Yeah, what the hell?

451
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:16,526
- You almost got her killed!
- I told you all to stay back!

452
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,229
I told you to listen
to every damn thing I said.

453
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:20,864
I told you that.

454
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:34,494
You three need new gigs.

455
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:38,048
You're not ready for runs yet.

456
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,167
Yeah, pretty sure
you got that backwards.

457
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,637
Hey. Hey.

458
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:47,257
Look, we got a way of
doing things around here.

459
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:50,260
- You tied up walkers.
- It killed our friend.

460
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:53,396
Look, I'm not having
this conversation.

461
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,182
<i>You obey my orders out there.</i>

462
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,267
Then we're just as screwed
as your last run crew.

463
00:38:02,774 --> 00:38:04,324
Say that again.

464
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,193
Tara:
<i>No, back off, Aiden.</i>

465
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:08,695
- Come on.
- Come on, man. Just take a step back.

466
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:10,864
Come on, tough guy.

467
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:12,999
No one's impressed, man.

468
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,534
Walk away.

469
00:38:14,536 --> 00:38:17,003
Deanna:<i> Aiden!</i>
<i>What is going on?</i>

470
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,372
This guy's got a problem
with the way we do things.

471
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:24,427
Why did you let these people in?

472
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,713
Because we actually know
what we're doing out there.

473
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:29,466
Aiden, no!
That's enough!

474
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:33,303
Deanna:
I said that is enough!

475
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:34,971
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

476
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:37,190
- Let's not do this now.
- Tell him.

477
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,559
You want to end up
on your ass again?

478
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:41,778
- Aiden:<i> Cool, all right?</i>
- Rick: Daryl.

479
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,065
(coughing)

480
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,490
I want everyone
to hear me, okay?

481
00:38:53,492 --> 00:38:56,660
<i>Rick and his people are part</i>
<i>of this community now</i>

482
00:38:56,662 --> 00:38:59,746
in all ways as equals.

483
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,919
Understood?

484
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:10,307
Understood.

485
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:16,146
All of you,
turn in your weapons.

486
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:18,265
Then you two come talk to me.

487
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:30,777
I told you I had a job for you.

488
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,862
I'd like you to be
our constable.

489
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,117
That's what you were.

490
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,620
That's what you are.

491
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:47,677
And you, too.

492
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:54,434
Will you accept?

493
00:39:57,472 --> 00:39:59,472
Okay.

494
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,976
Yeah, I'm in.

495
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:04,945
(scoffs)

496
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:11,785
Thank you.

497
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:14,654
For what?

498
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:16,656
For knocking him on his ass.

499
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:34,140
You don't like me, do you?

500
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:42,232
Rick: <i>You should keep
your gates closed.</i>

501
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,351
Deanna:<i> Why?</i>

502
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:50,106
Because it's all about
survival now.

503
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,108
At any cost.

504
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,698
<i>People out there are always</i>
<i>looking for an angle.</i>

505
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,034
<i>Looking to play</i>
<i>on your weakness.</i>

506
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,205
<i>They measure you</i>

507
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:08,675
<i>by what they can take from you,</i>

508
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,294
<i>by how they can use you to live.</i>

509
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,060
We good?

510
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:28,862
Yeah.

511
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:30,857
You a cop again?

512
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:33,560
(sighs)

513
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:35,612
I'm trying it on for size.

514
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:41,735
So we're staying?

515
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:46,790
I think we can start
sleeping in our own homes.

516
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,709
Settle in.

517
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:52,913
If we get comfortable here,
we let our guard down--

518
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:56,416
this place is gonna
make us weak.

519
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:59,085
Carl said that.

520
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:00,887
But it's not gonna happen.

521
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,680
We won't get weak.

522
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:14,267
That's not in us anymore.

523
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:19,522
We'll make it work.

524
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:24,578
And if they can't make it...

525
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,616
then we'll just take this place.
