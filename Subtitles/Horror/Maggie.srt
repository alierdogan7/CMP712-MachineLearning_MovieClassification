00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,610
<i>Dad.</i>

2
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,161
<i>I've gone to the city.</i>

3
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,403
<i>Please don't come for me.</i>

4
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,327
There's a curfew here.
Just... just keep them safe.

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,004
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

6
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,329
<i>I love you.</i>

7
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,923
<i>You are listening to NPR.
I'm host, David Newborn,</i>

Now for today's top headlines.</i>

9
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,128
<i>Months after the initial
worldwide outbreak,</i>

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,726
<i>national and local governments
are beginning to suppress</i>

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,241
<i>the necroambulis virus epidemic.</i>

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,485
<i>The Department of Agriculture has found
no solution for infected, dying crops.</i>

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,803
<i>Agriculture Officials are encouraging
farmers to burn their crops</i>

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,964
<i>in a desperate attempt to destroy
what may be preventing growth.</i>

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,927
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,048
<i>Curfew is at 8:00.</i>

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
<i>While citizens of inner cities</i>

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,847
<i>and metropolitan areas
remain hardest hit,</i>

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>through quick response and quarantine,</i>

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,247
<i>weekly infections reports
have dropped 30%.</i>

21
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,243
<i>Cleanup and martial law
are still in effect.</i>

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,971
<i>Medical officials,
along with the CDC,</i>

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,771
<i>have been tight-lipped
about a cure or vaccine.</i>

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,967
<i>As for the infected,
scientists are now suggesting</i>

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,010
<i>that an elevated sense of smell
is the telltale sign</i>

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,767
<i>of what's being referred to
as "the turn."</i>

27
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,570
Check this one for infection.
Look at that skin.

28
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,290
Yeah, we caught another, 10-4.

29
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,842
- Curfew-breaker. See if infected, over.
- Get her here.

30
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,410
<i>Doctors with stage
three patients are reminded</i>

31
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,246
<i>quarantine pickup is at 1700 hours.</i>

32
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,849
Sir? You shouldn't be in here.

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,168
This is the shelter
for the infected. It's dangerous.

34
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,209
But my daughter is here.

35
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,370
- What's her name?
- Maggie.

36
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,205
Marguerite.
Marguerite Vogel.

37
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,522
Marguerite Vogel...

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,684
Mr. Vogel?

39
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,451
Your daughter's bite wound
was very severe.

40
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,961
Now, we may know a lot about this,

41
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,646
except that we can't stop this yet.

42
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,730
She's probably going to show
more signs of aggression.

43
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,881
She's gonna lose her appetite,
and then she's gonna get it back again.

44
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,209
Look at me.

45
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,966
When that happens,
take her to quarantine.

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,841
I wouldn't normally release
someone with her type infection.

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,082
I'm doing this
as a favor for Vern.

48
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,129
Quarantine is eight weeks in.

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,648
Say your goodbyes and
get her straight to Blaire.

50
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,041
I'll send all the necessary
paperwork to Vern.

51
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,522
He'll follow up and answer
any questions you have.

52
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,044
Good luck, Mr. Vogel.

53
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,686
Dad? Dad!

54
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,682
- I'm sorry.
- I've been searching everywhere for you.

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,320
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,204
What did he say?

57
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,331
The doctor?

58
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,129
Vern helped us get you out.

59
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,924
Stop picking at it!

60
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,049
- Where are you going?
- Inside.

61
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,204
- Mag.
- I'll be fine.

62
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,563
Hello?

63
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,724
Hello?

64
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,405
Maggie? Maggie?
Get in the truck!

65
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,451
- What's wrong?
- Just do it right now. Come on. Go.

66
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,361
Mom! Daddy's home!

67
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,729
Slow down, honey! Oh!

68
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,087
- Did you pack your bag?
- Mm-hm.

69
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,005
- Is Pretty Pony going?
- Mm...

70
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,243
You're not taking Pretty Pony?

71
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,162
- Got everything you need?
- Yeah.

72
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,726
Daddy!

73
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,481
We missed you.

74
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,201
- It's so good to see you.
- Hey. Hey, Moll.

75
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,408
What happened to your arm?

76
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,005
Oh, uh...

77
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,407
I just got hurt.

78
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,443
I scratched mine,

79
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,171
but Mommy fixed it.

80
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,761
- Who fixed yours?
- Uh, the doctors.

81
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,651
Is that where you were?

82
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,770
Yeah. it took
a while for them to fix it.

83
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,405
I missed you.

84
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,766
Dad said you were sick...

85
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,770
but you're dying, huh?

86
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,849
Bobby...

87
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,881
A few kids at my school
got infected.

88
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,169
I knew one of them. Steven.

89
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,841
I didn't like him much,
but... I don't think he deserved to die.

90
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,445
Does it hurt?

91
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,446
No. Not anymore.

92
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,768
Why do we have to stay
with Aunt Linda?

93
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,208
Because I'm contagious.

94
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,121
Mom's afraid we'll get it.

95
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,728
Just because she loves you.

96
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,570
Hey. Go on,
and be nice to Molly.

97
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,683
Bobby?

98
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,243
- I missed you, kiddo.
- Missed you, too.

99
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,769
Ready?

100
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,081
<i>They tell us that
patients have days left</i>

101
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,961
<i>before what
they're considering the final stage.</i>

102
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,967
<i>And stay tuned at the top of the hour.
We'll be in conversation...</i>

103
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,567
Why don't you get settled
and help me with the dishes?

104
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,402
Caroline is fixing us
something to eat.

105
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,847
I'm not hungry.

106
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,808
Allie called a few times.

107
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,883
Two weeks?

108
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,208
You spent two weeks
out there looking for me?

109
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,725
Yeah.

110
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,767
I made a promise to your mother...

111
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,843
that I would protect you.

112
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,089
Yeah, but...
what about you guys?

113
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,802
- What if I hurt you?
- Don't worry.

114
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,884
Caroline and I,
we know the precautions.

115
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,731
You shouldn't
have brought me back.

116
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,404
You have to eat something.

117
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,605
For me.

118
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,086
I'll try.

119
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,841
Maggie?
Where are your bandages?

120
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,562
I'm so glad I came down.

121
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,001
I know, I know. I...

122
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,686
I just can't look at it.

123
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,764
I can't see it, knowing what's
going to happen to her.

124
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,083
I just can't do it, Wade. I'm...

125
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,924
I'm Sorry.

126
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,881
I just don't understand. I...

127
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,010
I keep asking Him and asking Him,

128
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,881
but... He's not giving me any answers.

129
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,850
Wade?

130
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,807
<i>- You've reached Fred and...
- Ken.</i>

131
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,122
<i>And we're out on the farm.</i>

132
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,681
<i>Leave us a message
and we'll get back to you.</i>

133
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,968
<i>Oh, that was awful.</i>

134
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,043
<i>That was pretty funny, though.</i>

135
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,400
<i>What do you
think about the schools opening up?</i>

136
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,164
<i>No, you need to stop pretending</i>

137
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,890
<i>bad things ain't happening out there.</i>

138
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,201
<i>Bad things?</i>

139
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,284
<i>Well now,
as the government sanction...</i>

140
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,762
<i>...people are ID 'ed in the system
and sent home with families.</i>

141
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,280
<i>They even have forced appointments
with their local doctors,</i>

142
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,891
<i>who report back
to the hospitals in the cities.</i>

143
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,680
<i>And if they violate their allotted time,</i>

144
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,171
<i>the authorities come to get them.</i>

145
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,800
<i>And how long does it take to turn?</i>

146
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,644
<i>How long is that allotted time?</i>

147
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,241
<i>They say six to eight weeks
for any one person to turn.</i>

148
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,200
<i>But, well, we know it's different
depending on who you are.</i>

149
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,964
<i>And what if someone turned early?</i>

150
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,964
<i>I mean, how many people
they gonna hurt...</i>

151
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,170
Maggie!

152
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,408
No. No.

153
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,131
<i>You don't
do that and then leave.</i>

154
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,240
<i>You don't send half of them
home to their families</i>

155
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,691
<i>and hope they come back to be killed.</i>

156
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,171
<i>You just kill them. That's all.</i>

157
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,125
Mag! Are you okay?

158
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,051
Your finger!

159
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,321
Come on, I've got you.

160
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,210
Here, sweetie. Sit down.

161
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,123
- Caroline?
- Let's see what I have.

162
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,201
I'll call our doctor.

163
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,365
Yes, it's Mrs. Vogel.
Caroline Vogel.

164
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,320
Yes, I'm... I'm calling
about my stepdaughter.

165
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,004
It's urgent.

166
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,411
It's an emergency.

167
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,250
Get behind me.

168
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,449
Nathan.

169
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,161
No, don't!
Please, Dad. No. Please!

170
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,086
Go home. Just go home.

171
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,084
Please, say something.

172
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,689
Nathan, please.

173
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,287
I asked him to say something.

174
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,125
Maggie used to babysit for her.

175
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,887
It had to be done.
Ain't nobody fighting that.

176
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,529
Bonnie was wrong
for what she done.

177
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,966
Was she?

178
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,169
She kept them in the house
and didn't notify anybody.

179
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,051
She should have brought
them into quarantine.

180
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,567
We had damn near the
whole station out there.

181
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,245
Now we can't
even find Bonnie.

182
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,690
Look, Wade.
When the time comes...

183
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,923
- Now, Ray...
- I know.

184
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,881
I know what you're thinking,
but... it's for the best.

185
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,080
You think about what those
two could have done today

186
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,931
if you hadn't have been out there.

187
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,760
Quarantine rules apply
to everybody, Wade.

188
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,531
- I mean, wake up! Look at the...
- Holt!

189
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,284
Go call the trucks down from Owensboro.

190
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,522
Tell them we've got
two bodies to clean up.

191
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,487
Holt.

192
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,407
Unbelievable.

193
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,401
Now, Ray, you and I,
we go back a long ways.

194
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,329
You've always done us right,

195
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,842
especially after Sarah's passing.

196
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,367
But I swear to God,

197
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,490
if you, him, or anyone else
come out here for her...

198
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,007
She's my daughter, Ray.

199
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,044
Trucks will be down here
in the morning, pick up the remains.

200
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,481
Wade...

201
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,365
Think about what
you had to do today,

202
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,245
what you might have
to do in the future.

203
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,369
How is she?

204
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,320
She asleep?

205
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,529
Her finger is gone.
She made sure of that.

206
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,404
I got it all bandaged up,

207
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,924
but she's still refusing
to go to the doctor.

208
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,242
I figured that.

209
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,923
What did Ray say?

210
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,562
He said that Bonnie
kept them locked up for a while.

211
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,609
Too long.

212
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,245
I killed them both.

213
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,449
No. You, uh...

214
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,648
They'd already moved on.

215
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,686
- There was something in their eyes.
- Wade.

216
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,487
You can't do this to yourself.

217
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,405
Bonnie should have taken them in.

218
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,368
And what about Mag?

219
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,489
What happens when she gets close?

220
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,928
Don't think about that right now.

221
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,688
Just... just...

222
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,288
Let's enjoy the time we have with her.

223
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,531
- What is it?
- Shh.

224
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,324
Wade?

225
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,564
Stay here.

226
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,689
Bonnie?

227
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,049
It's late.

228
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,164
How's Mag?

229
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,600
About as good as she can be.

230
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,086
Doctors gave us
all these special rules

231
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,086
and papers for children
with her condition.

232
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,247
"Lock subject in room at night.

233
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,489
"Avoid touching subject
without gloves."

234
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,689
Never once said her name.

235
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,320
Julia.

236
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,727
She's just four.

237
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,201
She was scared.

238
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,921
She slept with us most nights
as it was, so we'd...

239
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,800
We'd take turns
with her through nights.

240
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,082
She got worse.

241
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,571
One night Nathan went in,

242
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,441
didn't wake me for my turn.
Next morning, door was locked.

243
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,730
Locked himself in with her.

244
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,044
I pounded and pounded
on that damn door,

245
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,767
cried till I couldn't no more.

246
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,766
Still, never answered.

247
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,562
But he knew.

248
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,688
He knew what he was doing.

249
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,971
Take me to where they're at.

250
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,723
Dad!
There's someone on the phone.

251
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,088
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Vogel?</i>

252
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,409
- Yes?
<i>- Yes. Hello, sir. This is Mr. Garmen</i>

253
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,291
<i>from the quarantine unit
of St. Mary's Hospital.</i>

254
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,649
<i>We're calling to inform you that
we've scheduled a follow up appointment</i>

255
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,804
<i>with Dr. Vern Kaplan to track
your daughter's progress</i>

256
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,321
<i>in advance of quarantine.</i>

257
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,083
Tomorrow we're
gonna go and see Vern about your finger.

258
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,767
No arguments.
You hear me?

259
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,730
James, Carrie,
get over here.

260
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,207
Right now!

261
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,442
Come here, sit by Mama.

262
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,522
Wade.

263
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,331
- Vern.
- Maggie.

264
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,682
Take a deep breath for me.

265
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,444
Let it out.

266
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,647
Lungs are clear.

267
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,049
Scans show that the asthma
has receded already,

268
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,806
and your heartbeat
is abnormally strong.

269
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,406
That's a good sign.

270
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,566
Now... let's have a look at your arm.

271
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,364
Looks like the origin site
is spreading.

272
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,811
Maggie, what happened here?

273
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,561
- She broke it.
- I cut it off.

274
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,404
Why would you
do such a thing?

275
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,370
What good's a finger
if your arm's falling off?

276
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,285
Maggie, your arm
is not going to fall off.

277
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,920
Now, there's a lot we don't
know about this thing,

278
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,802
but this decay, it'll stop.

279
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,329
Your arm is yours to keep.
You got me?

280
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,648
I'm gonna take
a sample, okay?

281
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,688
Allie's been asking about you.

282
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,050
Said she tried
to call a few times.

283
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,210
I know she'd love
to hear from you, so...

284
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,330
give her a call, okay?

285
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,050
Doctor's orders.

286
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,481
All right, all done.

287
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,048
All we gotta do now
is put a dressing on it.

288
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,363
I'll have Judy come in
and take care of that.

289
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,563
There you are.

290
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,361
She's strong,

291
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,449
but from what I've seen,

292
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,489
it's progressing fast in her.

293
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,487
Pretty soon,
she ain't gonna want any food.

294
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,246
She's gonna want something more.

295
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,325
Skin will start smelling like meat.

296
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,450
When it finally happens,
you're gonna have a few choices.

297
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,281
One, take her to quarantine.

298
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,171
I'm not gonna do that.

299
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,243
I wasn't suggesting it.

300
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,051
My report will say
she's progressing slow,

301
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,407
so it'll buy you some time.

302
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,609
Option two:

303
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,048
We give her the cocktail
they'd give her in quarantine.

304
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,601
At least this way she'd be
with you when she takes it,

305
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,367
and not a bunch of strangers
or other infected people.

306
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,850
But you know how she doesn't
feel anything right now?

307
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,844
She will feel this.

308
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,449
Reports say that it's painful.

309
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,886
Extremely.

310
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,129
All the way up till the end.

311
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,689
What's option three?

312
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,161
Make it quick.

313
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,882

314
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,691

321
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,448
Caroline, the food is delicious.

322
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,241
Oh...
Ah, the stove is shot. I...

323
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,801
Some of it's really...

324
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,447
You think this is funny? Hm?

325
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,282
Well, no dessert for either of you.

326
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,211
Is that a threat
or a stay of execution?

327
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,688
Why do you even still
have this piece of crap?

328
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,882
Well, because I trust
this piece of crap.

329
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,128
You know,
Caroline had four cars now,

330
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,090
- and they all broke down.
- Yeah, I know.

331
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,686
I had to pick her up the last time.

332
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,571
What did you pick her up in?

333
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,165
You see?

334
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,331
What are you reading there?

335
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,484
Uh, it's called
"Morning Light of the Past."

336
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,120
It was in one of Mom's boxes.

337
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,329
It's like really, really weird.

338
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,524
Your mother was a bookworm.

339
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,970
Until today, I still don't
know what she saw in me...

340
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,163
because she had everything.

341
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,721
She was smart, beautiful,

342
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,645
- and she had those long legs.
- Okay. Okay, Dad. Thank you.

343
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,441
- That's enough.
- What? I mean, I'm just saying.

344
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,366
I mean, the whole time we dated,
she always pushed books on me.

345
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,727
She always
wanted me to read more.

346
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,922
And I just didn't have
the time with the farm and all.

347
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,647
- You read to me all the time.
- Only because she made me.

348
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,442
I remember just
before you were born...

349
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,446
and I bought a whole bunch of books.

350
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,285
And your mother had
a hell of a green thumb.

351
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,681
And there was this one book

352
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,525
that I read to you
over and over.

353
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,327
It was called "A Daisy's Journey."

354
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,444
That's actually how you got your name.

355
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,481
- There's a Marguerite in it?
- And your mother loved those flowers.

356
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,768
She just loved them.

357
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,324
And she was so strong.

358
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,131
I mean, every time
she needed to fight back,

359
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,567
she did.

360
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,441
You have a lot of your mother in you.
You know that?

361
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,962
You know, maybe
it was the, um, truck.

362
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,527
What?

363
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,240
Why Mom loved you.

364
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,050
Well, that's for sure.

365
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,083
My truck.

366
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,851
<i>No!</i>

367
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,162
<i>No!</i>

368
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,048
No! No!

369
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,448
Maggie? Allie's here.

370
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,726
Hey. Oh my God.
There she is!

371
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,326
Shut up.

372
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,720
- Oh...
- Hi!

373
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,723
Where have you been?

374
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,850
Oh. Well, I haven't
been feeling too well.

375
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

376
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,127
Well, how are you feeling right now?

377
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,051
- Uh, right now?
- Yeah.

378
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,527
Um... why?

379
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,968
Okay. All right. Trent and Candace
and a few other people

380
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,288
are going out to the reservoir tonight.

381
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,287
I know it's not like
a super fun trip to KC or whatever,

382
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,330
but school starts soon
and I doubt our parents

383
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,165
are gonna let us out
much further than that.

384
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,245
- Trent's going?
- Yeah. Did you hear?

385
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,086
Yeah. How's he doing?

386
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,369
I don't know. I mean,
he seems all right,

387
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,767
but don't take my word for it.

388
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,161
You should come see for yourself.

389
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,766
Right.

390
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,130
Come on. Everybody misses you.
They wanna see you.

391
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,890
I miss you,

392
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,407
and I'm not going without you. Okay?

393
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,770
Hey, uh, hold on real quick.

394
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,605
- What?
- Here.

395
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,482
I found it on the couch the other day
and threw it on this old thing.

396
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,371
I figured you might wanna wear it.

397
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,927
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.

398
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,926
Go, get out of here
before Allie explodes.

399
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,411
Yeah, I know, right?
We are late.

400
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,969
And you have a nice
young man waiting for you.

401
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,770
Is it gonna be like
this all night?

402
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,729
- Um, yes.
- Oh God!

403
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,247
- Yes, it actually is.
- Take me now.

404
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,724
Oh, here we go!

405
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,245
- Hey! How are you?
- Hey.

406
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,801
- Hey!
- Hi. Long time no see!

407
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,128
<i>I don't get why they're
opening up the school so soon.</i>

408
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,762
- Gotta get back to normal.
- Normal?

409
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,082
What's normal about all of this?

410
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,208
Now, we have teachers missing.

411
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,124
Still have a bunch of infected people.

412
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,281
No offense. Not you guys.

413
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,370
But like the Andersons. You know?

414
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,763
- How many more are like that?
- What happened?

415
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,922
She had them locked up in a room.

416
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,971
Didn't tell anybody.

417
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,323
And they got out,
and Mag's dad found her.

418
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,245
Holy shit, Mag.
What'd your dad do?

419
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,926
Look, does it matter?
They're dead.

420
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,969
Point is, she screwed up.

421
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,523
I mean, how many other people
have people locked away? You know?

422
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,722
What should Bonnie have done?

423
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,121
What would you do?

424
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,887
What should my dad
do to me? Quarantine?

425
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,805
Do you know
what it's like there?

426
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,850
My uncle works
at the hospital in KC.

427
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,924
He said that they tell
people everything's nice.

428
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,926
That they'll...
They'll hold your hand until the end,

429
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,885
but they don't.

430
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,084
They throw you in a big room
with everyone else.

431
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,720
They don't separate the phases.

432
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,491
Everyone's all bunched up together,

433
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:27,804
people eating people,

434
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,089
and they don't care.

435
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,480
So what would you do?

436
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,727
You know what I would do to me?

437
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,164
I'd put a gun right here.

438
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,606
Bang.

439
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,447
Mason's a dick.

440
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,680
He's just afraid.

441
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,531
Yeah, but he's still a dick.

442
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,850
You know he stayed over
the night before I got bit?

443
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,202
Played video games
and got into all of Dad's beer.

444
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,200
And when he found out, he put me
to work in the field the next morning.

445
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,723
She looked really bad, Mag.

446
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,200
I don't know why I went
over to her, but I did.

447
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,091
Felt bad, I guess.

448
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,602
I told her to stay there,

449
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,486
but when I turned around
to call for Dad...

450
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,123
she bit me.

451
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,284
I could see it in her eyes.

452
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,006
She regretted it.

453
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,640
Probably didn't even know she did it.

454
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,849
Then Dad showed up.

455
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,322
He shot her in the chest
and in the head.

456
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,969
I'm sorry.

457
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,122
It's not your fault.

458
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,842
No. No. I mean...

459
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,889
about us.

460
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,084
I figured I'd done something wrong.

461
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,564
No. I was just...

462
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,802
scared, I guess.

463
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,884
Yeah. Me, too.

464
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,289
I missed you.

465
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,283
I missed you, too.

466
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,766
I missed that.

467
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,729
So did I.

468
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,850
Well...

469
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,611
Thanks.

470
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,082
Yeah. I'm gonna see you
again this weekend, right?

471
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,289
Yeah. I promise.

472
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,206
Okay. Well, I'm going to hold you to it.

473
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,408
Yeah, when don't you?

474
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,730
Hey, wait. Wait.

475
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,087
I love you, okay?

476
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,522
I love you, too.

477
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,081
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Okay.

478
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,409
Dad?

479
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,370
Hey.
There's no need to shout.

480
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,409
He's downstairs.

481
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,441
- Here. Let me see.
- Not too close.

482
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,364
I'll be fine.

483
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,807
Do you smell that?

484
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,806
No.

485
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,363
Are you sure?
It smells like food.

486
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:33,248
It's probably your father
cooking up something you shouldn't have.

487
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,807
I'll get the drops.

488
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,441
Wade?

489
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,926
Caroline?
You find the drops?

490
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,084
No! No. Hold on a sec.

491
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,162
Oh, hey, did you find them?

492
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,241
Thanks.

493
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,847
So, what was Dad cooking?

494
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,088
- Caroline?
- Oh, uh...

495
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,006
Nothing. Hm... Nothing.

496
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,567
Maggie? Phone!

497
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,370
Hello?

498
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,602
Trent?

499
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,085
What?

500
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,408
Trent.

501
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,801
Please.

502
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,207
Just open the door.

503
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,049
Please.

504
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,491
What are you doing in here?

505
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,047
Just let me talk to him.

506
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,246
Trent?

507
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,609
Maggie.

508
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,284
I can't open the door.

509
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,569
I smelled him, Mag.

510
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,841
I can't go to quarantine.

511
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,761
<i>We're ready for
the extraction and will confirm with you</i>

512
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,446
<i>- that we are en route.</i>
- Easy, gentlemen. Easy.

513
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,400
<i>Go ahead with the extraction.</i>

514
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,927
Your uncle said
he would take care of you!

515
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,890
- He said it wouldn't be like the others.
- I won't go!

516
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,286
Look, I know
that you're scared.

517
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,370
I am, too.

518
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,601
But you are so strong.

519
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,404
I've always seen that in you.

520
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,889
Just... just let me in!

521
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,963
This is the police.
We are entering the home!

522
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,681
Let's go.

523
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,848
Get away from the door,
Maggie.

524
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,044
Maggie? Please?

525
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,125
You need to open the door!

526
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,566
Come on, son.
It's time.

527
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,202
Trent?
Just open the door.

528
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,890
Step back, son.

529
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,962
Dad? Please? Dad, please!

530
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,690
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Listen.

531
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,002
- It's gonna be okay! Trent!
- Maggie!

532
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,607
It's gonna be okay!

533
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,281
Go home, Maggie.

534
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,851
Just go home.

535
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,841
Dais? Maggie!

536
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,568
Wade? Oh!

537
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:33,123
Maggie!

538
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,362
Wade!

539
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,042
Wade!
We have to take her in!

540
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,202
- No! No! No!
- We have to take her in now!

541
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,850
No!

542
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,281
Look at me. Look at me.

543
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,609
Good, Daisy baby.
That's good.

544
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,764
Now tell me.
What happened?

545
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,763
- Hey, come on.
- Don't!

546
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,845
I'm not moving!
I'm not moving.

547
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,849
He was afraid of me.

548
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,281
I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.

549
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,011
I swear, I didn't know it.
I didn't know it.

550
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,970
What was?
What was afraid of you?

551
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,125
The fox. The fox.

552
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,401
I heard...
I heard it and then I...

553
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,366
And then I caught it in the trap,
and it smelled...

554
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,326
I couldn't stop.

555
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,842
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.

556
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,571
Daddy, I just wanted to help it!

557
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:46,645
Daddy, I just wanted to help it!
I'm sorry!

558
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,849
Don't.

559
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,690
I'm sorry.

560
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,250
It's okay.

561
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,570
It's okay.

562
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,568
Wade, please,

563
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,610
just call them.
It's time now.

564
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,205
She has to go in.

565
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,808
What if it was Molly?

566
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,885
Or Bobby?

567
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,085
After everything
that we've been through,

568
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,322
you still think it's about that?

569
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,165
I've loved her like she was my own,

570
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,368
but she's not her anymore.

571
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,323
- Wade, please.
- Don't.

572
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,246
I'm chewing so loud.

573
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,841
She was afraid of me,
wasn't she?

574
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,329
When did she leave?

575
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,409
Yesterday.

576
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,325
I don't feel well.

577
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,084
You got enough firewood there?

578
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,766
Well, if you'd get
the power turned back on again,

579
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,127
I wouldn't have
to do this everyday.

580
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,601
Well, you know
that's not my department.

581
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,285
So, why are you here?

582
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,530
Need to talk to you about Mag.

583
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,444
The time's come, Wade.

584
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,123
Can we see her?

585
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,569
- This is bullshit.
- Holt.

586
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,371
No. She's well beyond the time.
She needs to be in quarantine.

587
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,285
We've got an entire town to protect!

588
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,930
I'm going to the house, Wade.

589
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,244
You know she needs
to be in quarantine.

590
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,606
Wade...

591
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,650
Get out of my way.

592
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,690
Now, come on, boys.
We don't need this.

593
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,401
Wade, just...

594
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,961
let us take a look at her.
All right?

595
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,566
You're not gonna take her in.

596
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,481
Wade!

597
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,322
Wade!

598
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,480
Stop!

599
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,410
Stop it!

600
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,251
Leave us alone.

601
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,885
Maggie?

602
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,328
Maggie, you tell me you're doing okay,
and we'll leave. All right?

603
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,530
Ray, look at her.

604
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,920
I'm all right.

605
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,328
Good.

606
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,926
That's all I needed to know.

607
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,804
Get your ass in the car.

608
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,369
Get in the goddamn car.

609
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,761
- Now, Ray...
- Shut up and listen.

610
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,651
I'll be back.

611
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,007
Between now and then,

612
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,481
you need to figure out
what you're gonna do.

613
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,884
I'm sorry about
what happened. I am...

614
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,201
but you and her ain't
the only ones in this town.

615
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,322
Are you okay?

616
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,484
- Are you?
- Yeah.

617
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,884
- What happened?
- Sit down.

618
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,361
They wanna
take me away, don't they?

619
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,331
Don't worry.

620
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,723
You're not going anywhere.

621
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,607
There's something
I want to show you.

622
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:23,208
It's Mama's garden.
But how?

623
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,082
It was your idea.

624
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,004
Before you ran off,

625
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,403
you said that I should plant
some daisies in Mom's garden.

626
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,967
That they would grow.

627
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,642
After you left,

628
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,201
I planted some.

629
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,449
And when we came back, this was here.

630
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,086
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

631
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,604
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

632
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,321
You have
to promise me that you'll do it.

633
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,171
Please.

634
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,608
Promise me that you'll make it stop.

635
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,407
I just can't...

636
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,043
I can't do it anymore.
You know?

637
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,443
Please, Dad. Please?

638
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,369
You have to do it. Please.

639
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:58,968
- Please.
- Okay, baby.

640
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,927
This is what they give the quarantined.

641
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,286
You want my personal opinion?

642
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,209
Use that instead.

643
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:36,122
Hey, munchkins.

644
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,527
I just wanted to call
to say that I love you guys.

645
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,082
Bobby, Molly.

646
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,891
I just wanted to say...

647
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,520
Is that you, Allie?

648
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,849
Tell him thank you
for bringing me home.

649
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,767
I just...
It was horrible.

650
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,324
I'm so lucky to have you.

651
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,764
- Dais?
- No.

652
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,841
No.

653
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,650
Maggie, what happened?

654
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,805
Maggie!

655
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,046
Maggie! Snap out of it!
Maggie! Snap out of it!

656
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,771
Come on!

657
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,287
Come on, don't do this!

658
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,365
Not yet. Maggie?

659
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,849
Snap out of it. Come on.

660
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,321
Daddy?

661
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,763
Daddy?

662
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,049
That's my girl.

663
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,362
- That's my baby.
- Daddy.
