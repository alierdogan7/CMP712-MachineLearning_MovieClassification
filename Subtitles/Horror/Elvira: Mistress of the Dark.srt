00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:55,660
Look at what just walk in!

157
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,060
- "Bloody Mary". 
- No hard liquor served past eight o'clock.

158
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:14,660
Do you want a "Virgin"?
- Maybe, but, ah.. I'll have a couple of drinks first. 

159
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,580
Hey babe, I got some(thing) to show you.

160
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,340
Sorry, left my magnifying glass at home.

161
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,860
Hey, that's pretty good! Billy,

162
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:49,830
no way to talk to a lady. So, how about a blowjob?

163
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,360
I bet you think *that was* pretty funny, don't you?

164
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,980
- I enjoyed it. 
- Yeah? Will you get enjoy this even more.

165
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
- I cut you, man. 
- Travis. 
- **

166
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:15,740
** baby* 

167
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,140
My name is Elvira. But you can call me.. 'tonight'.

168
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,740
I'm Bob, Bob Redding. Pleased to meet you.

169
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,340
Look at this mess, who, the *heckles*, gonna pay for it?

170
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,760
- It's allright, Patty, I'll take care the damages.
- Seems to me it's all this cheap little tart's fault.

171
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,280
Cheap? *Who you called* cheap? What perfume you *worn*? "Catch of the day"?

172
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,980
Look, honney, I don't know what hole you crawled out, but I suggest you crawl right back in if you know what good for you.

173
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,980
Oh, yeah, you better watch eye ** be careful of not get someone's eye out with that ** things.

174
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,980
We better go.

175
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,740
It looks like you've got some competition, Patty.

176
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,860
Charlie, trash does not compete with class.

177
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,860
.. right down the street, at "Cozy Cot."

178
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh. So, what brought you to Falwell?

179
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,660
My car.

180
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,000
No, really I'm came for the reading of my great-aunt Morgana's will.

181
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,060
Morgana Talbot? She is your aunt?

182
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,760
Yes, *it was* a surprise to me too.

183
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,340
I never really know her, but I sure admire her spunk.

184
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,060
She never **came dinner** like* the way* everybody else in this town has.

185
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, I don't wanna bore you with local politics.

186
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,980
Go ahead, bore me.

187
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Ok. We've got this town council that lives in mortal fear

188
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,500
that somewhere, somehow, someboby in Falwell *has having *a good time.

189
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,980
*Bunch of real preservatives.*

190
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,260
- I run the movie house. 
- Oh, really? I'm in movies too! Have you ever shown, uh, "I married Satan?"

191
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,460
- No. 
- How about the sequel "I Married Satan 2?"

192
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,340
No.

193
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:19,000
I, ah.. I can only play G-rated movies. 
- Oh well, there's nothing wrong with G-rated movies, as long as there's lots of sex and violence.


194
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:30,080
I'm, hey, listen Bob, I'm only can be in town for a couple of days and I can think about anyone who I'd rather squeeze in my agenda.

195
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:48,038
Gee, that be so well.

196
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,080
.

197
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, Mr. Talbot, your sister was like a mother to me.

198
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,500
She was a mother to me too, dear. Well, now that we've dispensed with the obligatory display of bereavement,

199
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,580
you may begin the proceedings, Mr. Bigelow.

200
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,260
It was Mrs. Talbot's wish, to have all of her relatives present to reading of the will.

201
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,580
All of her relatives are present - me, myself, and I.

202
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,980
Apparently Ms. Talbot had a grand-niece, Elvira, who is also one of the beneficiaries.

203
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,280
That is impossible.

204
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,660
- Well. 
- Who is this grand-niece?

205
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey guys! Sorry I'm late, but then, so is my aunt.

206
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Hey, what she dies *for?* Nothing serious, I hope.

207
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,060
Say, nice jacket. Who shot the couch?

208
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,980
There is a bathroom around here? I'm telling you the toilet over the "Cozy Cot" looks like somebody's science project.

209
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,360
Who is this woman?

210
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,260
This must be Ms Talbot's grand-niece.

211
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,000
Elvira, this is your grand-aunt's brother, Vincent Talbot.

212
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,260
She was my aunt, and you are her brother, you must be my Uncle Vinnie!

213
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,000
- Get this woman off of me! 
- And you must be Aunty Em and Uncle Remus.

214
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,980
Oh! There is no place like home! There is no place like home!

215
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
Hurry up, Bigelow, lets get on with it!

216
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:29,980
Yeah, really, lets get go on, otherwise somebody else dies.

217
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,680
"This is the certified only last will and testament of the deceased Morgan Talbot."

218
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,600
"To my housekeeper, Mrs. Morrissey, for years of loyalty and devotion, I leave my silver tea service

219
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,140
and a cash allotment of $5,000."

220
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,980
Hey, baby what's *you(your) *worrying* about? You ** out * like a ***bandits****

221
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,660
"To Mr. Morrisey, my driver, I leave my automobile and a allotment of $5,000."

222
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,500
Wow, *dude* 10 grand just for a **help** * old aunt ****

223
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,600
Oh, I mean, dear sweet Aunt Morgana, so ***really very*** generous!

224
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,660
What it says about me? What I get? What I get? What I get?

225
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:21,460
- "To my grand-niece Elvira.."
- Come on, ** about me, Aunt Morgana, big bucks, big bucks!

226
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,860
"I bequeath * my house, my beloved poodle, Algonquin and my precious book of recipes."

227
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,860
That's it? A house, a dog and a book?

228
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,680
Please, if you will allow me to finish.

229
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,140
"And finally, to my dear brother, Vincent, I leave the rest of my estate and holdings,

230
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,580
which *stare* is none."

231
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,140
Where's the cash? Where is the furniture? Where is Bob Ubanks?

232
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,340
He was not mention.

233
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,300
I *don't** get it me *, boss. What's so important about a *damn* recipe book?

234
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:04,680
That damn recipe book content more power than your **fi*vle** little mind can ever imagine.

235
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,260
And it rightfully belongs to me. I must have that book.

236
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,160
Great! *just*  I need a house. And a house in Falwell, *like* I need a padded bra.

237
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:23,740
I can not live here. I would go crazy! I tell you!
- Crazy!

238
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,580
- May I if you a ride?
- Fuzz off, creep, I'm not in the mood!

239
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,140
Oh, it's you, Uncle Vinnie! 
- Yes!

240
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:38,400
Uncle Vinnie.. I must apologize for my behavior in the office, it's just that your appearance was a bit of a shock to me.

241
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
It's OK. My appearance is kind of a shock to everybody. 

242
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,260
Yes, well, as you * may assumes, * my sister and I, well.. let's just say we had a differences.

243
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,340
Yeah, I guess, you really got shafted.

244
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Look, I *tell you what, *uncle Vinnie, err.. I'll share my inheritance with you. You can have the dog.

245
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,000
No! Thank you! But I would be interested in requiring that recipe book.

246
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
You know, *for the* sentimental reasons. I be willing to pay you.

247
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
Say, fifty dollars.

248
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,860
Yeah! Sure! I'll do it for fifty buсks.

249
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Vinnie, you got yourself that cookbook.

250
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
The lawyer guys take me over the house, so you can pick up it later.

251
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,080
Fine. I'll see you there.

252
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,860
Oh, don't forget to bring a cash.

253
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,580
Drive!

254
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:34,860
*If wanna those **barrels** should have *** Oh, we're here!

255
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,860
Hey, this place ain't *have* bad! *But* you can get a *abound* for it.

256
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:54,580
Yes, you could, but your house is over there.

257
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,560
Oh, Mr. Talbot, I just wanted to thank you for that generous donation you make to the Morality Club.

258
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,060
- You're quite welcome. 
- You know, as I always say, morality *are* cheap.

259
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,880
And speaking of cheap, a little birdy told me that that Elvira, woman is a related to you.

260
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,900
* Now, **Not any say**any of my business, but then, of course, everything, yes.

261
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,660
Believe me, I'm so anxious to get rid of her as you are.

262
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, good! You know, because someone like that comes to town, the next thing, you know,

263
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the're tiching sex education in the schools,

264
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
*and* passing out condoms to *kindergartens*. You remember when those ***..

265
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,060
She won't to be with us very long.

266
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:44,000
*Yeah, well I know, I need it somewere Chastity Pariah can do, well, I know.*

267
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,740
Careful! Some of the boards to loose.

268
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,000
- What a dump! 
- **/* I 'm not that say, but **/** a house needs a little something.

269
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,740
Yeah! Like a wrecking ball.

270
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,740
- I think Algonquin likes you. 
- **  **, go on, go takes * some in the little stretch.

271
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:16,060
I can't stand a little dogs. Boy, if my aunt was not dead, I'll kill her.

272
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:23,140
Sorry, Aunt Morgana, just kidding.

273
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,680
Here is the rest of her inheritance.

274
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,460
Your great aunt's recipe book.

275
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,580
Oh, yeah, some inheritance. Well, at least I'm get'g 50 bucks for it.

276
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Say, how much you think I can get for this place?

277
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Well, if * not the house in *disrepair* it is in the prime location * I've don't you decay* you could get.. 70 thousand.

278
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,360
- 70 grand? 
- Maybe more, if you were fixed up. Would you be interested in selling?

279
00:26:51,360 --> 00:27:01,460
*** Of course I'm interested!

280
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:13,740
Now, what am I can to do with you?

281
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,500
That's we like it, Algonquin?

282
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:36,580
Algonquin, what a sissy name! *Let's see* will I call you? I know, Gonk. Hey, you like that?

283
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, hold your horses.

284
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,760
Hi, Uncle Vinnie, you're here for the book, right? Come on in. Oh, can I make you cup of tea or something?

285
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,400
- I wouldn't wanna produce to any trouble. 
- Good point.

286
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,600
I can't stay very long, anyway.

287
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,660
- Say, you don't wanna buy a house, would you? 
- I'm afraid not.

288
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,000
- I'll sell *at* you really cheap. 
- No, thank you.

289
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,260
Vinnie, they don't make houses like this anymore, I mean. Look at the details.

290
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,000
Look, look at the craftsmanship!

291
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,680
How would you pay for a house like this?

292
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,360
Don't answer, because you not only get the house, if you act right now you also get this beautiful furniture.

293
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,000
Now would you pay? I tell you it's a jewel box.

294
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's a gem, love hatch for two.

295
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,460
I'd bend over backwards *to* make a deal, I'd bend over forwards. *******

296
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,660
No! Just the book!

297
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:33,460
OK. If you *wanna* get crab ******

298
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,200
How (it's) weird. I wanna swear (swore) the book was just on the table.

299
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,840
- You promised me that book!
**- Hey, don't get you pennies not bunch.* Didn't it's walk away. You sure * will turn out.**

300
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes! Of course, you will. Forgive me.

301
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:08,340
Thinks it's a pitbull.

302
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:19,260
*Luckily I will *not be for very long. *The neighbors never get asleep.*

303
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,660
About time, Doofus. Did you bring a camera?

304
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,000
- I look like an idiot? 
- You really want me to answer that?

305
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:37,860
Shut up, you guys! *She can hear us.*

306
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:44,860
Mirror, mirror, on the wall who is the most **up dead* gorgeous one of all?

307
00:29:44,880 --> 00:30:02,838
Oh, * you're saying me that.*

308
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,580
- Crap. 
- What do you see? What do you see? 
- Wait a minute.

309
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,140
I can't see.

310
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:30,118
Wow!

311
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:45,000

312
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,660
Awesome.

313

/*We wanted to see the condition of the house to help repair it.*/

317
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,060
That's very thoughtful, but mind you come back when lights better.

318
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,740

Oh, gee, too bad ** they don't on the** a bank. I'll be right down.

It's fabulous!

338
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,980

339
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,980

340
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,480
- I'd say it was next to planet. 
- *** half the teenagers in town riding around *to* that jungle music.

341
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:28,740
And this morning on my regularly tour of the boys lavatory I confiscated this!

342
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,880
I'll be making the announcement this afternoon.

343
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:39,340
*Handforth,* all students will be subject to immediate expulsion if there are found in the company of that floozy!

344
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,000
Please, I don't think we need to resort the name calling.

345
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,300
I think what Calvin is trying to say is that this Elvira

346
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,000
is a person of easy virtue, a purveyor of pulchritude,

347
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,980
one moment Sodom and Gomorrah, if you will.

348
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,880
A slimy slithering succubus, a concubine, a street walker, a tramp, a slut, a cheap whore!

349
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,680
She'll be nothing but a bad dream just as soon as she sells that property. An open house is already planned on tomorrow.

350
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,800
But what if she decides not to sell? What if she decides to settle here?

351
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,680
Well, if she is morally unfit, then we have every right to do anything we can to get her out of this town.

352
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,900
Are we agree? 
- Absolutely.

353
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,580
- Maybe we're not being entirely objective about she.. 
- Shut up, Leslie!

354
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,860
And it's unanimous.

Dearest Elvira! For all these years

530
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,000
I protected you from the truth,

531
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,060
but the time has now come when your only protection is the truth.

532
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,280
Say what?

533
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,200
Let me see this.

534
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,960
Your mother, Devana, was an extraordinary woman.

535
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,500
She was the true Mistress of the Dark. But her power did not go unchallenged.

536
00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:00,880
For three hundred years your Great Uncle Vincent *conjure *ed* her dominion.

537
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,000
Three hundred! God! I hope I'll look that *when I'm that old.*

538
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,880
He would've destroyed you as he did her, if I had not sent you away.

539
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,080
I've left you with all the power you would need to protect to yourself. And entrusted you to my loyal familiar.

540
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,960
- What's said about familiar? 
- Bob, have not you ever seen the old Roger Corman movies?

541
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:26,400
Every witch has *one err..* like a, like a pet, that can change to almost anything. Where was I? Ou, yeah.

542
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:33,740
But it wasn't you alone that I sought to protect, it was the book that contain your mother's magic.

543
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,940
Our enemy is a formidable one. Protect the book, Elvira,

544
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:43,760
and above all keep it from Vincent when the moon falls under the Earth's shadow.

545
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,580
Remember, you carry the power with you.

546
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,860

01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,740
Yeah, and you heard what your aunt said. He can't get his hands on it.

551
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,360

01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,580
Of course, I should have known that she was that little harlot.

*Yeah, ride her * right out of town on a big fat rail.

She might enjoy that too much.

619
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:57,660
There is a much more satisfactory solution.

620
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:02,580
We can have her arrested. 
- Arrested, on what charges?

621
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:08,100
It's so happens that there is a law on that book that dates back to the Salem trials,

622
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,000
it's specifically prohibit and I quote:

623
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:23,000
"Any town's person from practicing the ancient arts of spell casting, demonology, alchemy and conjuration."

01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:34,000
The charge, my fellow council members, is witchcraft. 

625
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,280
- Let me out of here! Let me out of here! 
- Stop *screaming* there!

626
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:43,080
Hey, I've seen the People's Court. I'm entitled to one phone call and a strip search. 

627
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:48,100
Well, there is a pay phone right across the street. What's the matter? You forget where you put your broom?

628
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:55,060
Listen, fatso, if I had a broom, I know exactly where I put it.

629
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,260
Oh, this is swell! I can just hear Manny now.

630
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,880
"Hello, Vegas! We get slight crimp on the plans for the show. 'Course star was burnt at the stake."

631
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,560
Elvira, great news. I get to the best lawyer in the county. He'll be here first sing */sign* in the morning.

632
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:16,960
Bob, in the morning? First sing */sign* in the morning I'll be able to fit in the ashtray. You gotta get me outta here!

633
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,480
But how?

634
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,000
The book! It's my only chance. Quick, went to the house and get it! 
- OK.

635
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
- Ou, Bob, wait! 
- What?

636
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,060
I hid it under the floor board in the living room. 
- OK.

637
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,880
- *Bob!* 
- What?

638
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:41,460
Hurry!

639
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:55,580
Move!

640
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:02,140
Now!

641
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:15,140
What do you whining about? I know *I'm getting* barbecue.

642
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:32,860
Sorry.

643
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:45,460
It's mine! The power is mine!

644
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:58,600
Gonk, *which does not give you a panic attack!*

645
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:05,000
Wow! I *think I took * too much acid in the '60s.

646
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:15,060
***** Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!

647
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:21,140
Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!

648
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,000
- Thank goodness, Padre! 
- I am here to save you, my child.

649
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,260
At last, someone* to talk some sense to *these people.

650
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,980
Lord, save this *raptured* creature's soul

651
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:48,740
even ** creamy white flesh will burn and ***

652
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:54,060
Well, isn't that convenient!

653
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,140
Thanks for trying, you guys!

654
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:13,280
Elvira!

655
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:24,980
Gonk, is that you, boy?

656
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,680
Good work, Gonk!

657
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,000
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

658
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,140
- Do you * smoke? 
- Guess we'll find out soon enough.

659
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:51,660
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

660
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,980
Burn the witch!

661
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:10,080
Oh, no! *You will believe* this! **I left the oven on! Be right back.**

662
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,000
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

663
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,980
- Any last words? 
- Just one: Help!

664
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,580
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

665
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:30,660
Hold it! Hold it now! Quiet. Quiet!

666
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:35,860
And now, by the power vested in me by the sovereign state of Massachusetts,

667
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:45,460
I do hereby pronounce sentence on Elvira, the prisoner. Death by fire!

668
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,700
- Hold it, sheriff! What you're doing is wrong. 
- Patty!

669
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:56,000
It all catch faster, if you light it in several places.

670
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,580
Patty, no!

671
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,860
We have *** this every year.

672
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,060
- Burn in hell, witch! 
- Patty!

673
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:19,580
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

674
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,880
Bye, kids! It *meant *swell!

675
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,980
Just send my ashes to Las Vegas!

676
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Let me through!

677
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,340
Elvira! 
- Bob!

678
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:51,340
- Hi, Bob. 
- Patty, you're not a very nice person! 

679
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:58,740
Gonk?

680
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:06,740
Remember, you carry the power with you.

681
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:24,718
The ring!

682
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:53,460
Are you alright?

683
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,580
Look, the Lunar eclipse!

684
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,980
Remember? Your aunt's letter? When the moon falls under the Earth shadow..

685
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:17,460
- Yeah, so? 
- Vincent's got the book.

686
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:22,340
Elvira!

687
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:30,060
Elvira!

688
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:38,000
Oh, you tricky little devil!

689
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Vincent, remember us?

690
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,500
We are on your side.

691
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:57,000
Swine!

692
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:05,980
Stay back!

693
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:17,980
Attack him, Gonk!

694
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,860
Don't make me use this!

695
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,260
The amulet could not protect your mother and it won't save you!

696
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:38,140
Kaldozar ipsole.

697
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:56,118
*Do you wanna play* rough thing? * Well, take this!

698
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,740
You can not escape me, daughter of Devana!

699
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:25,260
I shall destroy you as I did her!

700
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:34,260
You're looking for me?

701
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:38,660
Did you think you could stop with your toys?

702
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:56,638
No, but I think it would be worth a shot. Look!

703
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:32,860
Cosa! Terra! Obtan!

704
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:50,838
Sure, it easy for you to say.

705
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:11,060
* That hurts!

706
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:18,460
Now, baby.

707
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,500
We have a little unfinished business.

708
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:27,000
Yeah, well, I think we could do business..

709
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,940
Yeah, sure, I can do to you..

710
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:34,000
Uh.. I'm cool, bro.. no, what it is.. What is that?..***

711
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:52,238
I'll show you what..

712
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:20,460
I am a Master of The Dark!

713
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:38,438
I'll see you in hell *berth!*

714
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:25,638
And now, Elvira, you'll die!

715
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:59,438
Remember, you carry the power with you!

716
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:09,740
So, what did the insurance(t) guy say?

717
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,980
My policy does not cover *ancient*/*accident* demons.

718
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,140
Well at least you still got the ring.

719
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:24,660
Yeah, but the only thing I *get* to do anymore is look cheap. 

720
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:31,460
Gosh, Elvira, I'm sorry. *I know you hate your heart some play in Las Vegas.*

721
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,500
I'm just not the kind of girl whose dreams come true.

722
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:41,000
I do better a nightmares.

723
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:56,980
- I wish I ** something I can do. 
- Oh, do not worry about me, Bob, I'm like a fake fruit, *** easy.

724
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,460
Hey, Bob, they comes to lynch *me.* Take it easy, take it easy, I'm living.

725
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:07,340
We don't want you to go. This is our way of saying we were wrong about you and we're sorry.

726
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:10,740
Elvira, you're the best thing that ever happened to our town.

727
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,500
You touch a part of my son that, that nobody's ever touched before.

728
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,680
How I wish..

729
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:23,340
As long as you in Falwell, you will always have a free room at the "Cozy Cot."

730
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:33,460
- Wait, just a minute, Leslie! 
- Shut up, you old bag!

731
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:42,060
- *Finally, I got it runnuing.* 
- Great! ** At least *now I have* a place to live.

732
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,260
But I still* have no way to *pay for it. 
- Do not worry, we *work out* something.

733
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:57,060
Elvira, I'm sorry that I set you on fire and everything and..

734
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,740
I hope there no heart fillings.

735
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,080
Do not worry, she is bigger than that.

736
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,460
Yeah, a lot bigger.

737
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,980
Elvira, I've got some an important papers that you gonna have to sign.

738
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,860
But your uncle gone you're the only heir to his estate.
