Armed Services? Why Armed Services?

75
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,013

to decimate your budget.

No. No, I might be able to get you five,

00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,634
go easy on me. (chuckles)

178
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:20,134
(clears throat softly)

179
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:23,378
It says here you're having Social
Security problems, Claire?

180
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:25,862
<i>I</i> don't have Social Security problems.

181
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,424
<i>You</i> have Social Security problems.

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,754
Right. And how may I help you with...

183
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,900
<i>my...</i> Social Security problems?

184
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,486
It's a rash, it's not
a preexisting condition.

185
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,674
And the Medicare doctor was so rude.

186
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:41,775
He said, uh,

187
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,741
"That's just a rash."

188
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,733
(chuckles): Huh! A rash!

189
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,718
- I really want to give it to the senator.
- Yes.

190
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,317
It's just, the senator's
a bit busy, so...

191
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,716
Why are you trying to keep me from him?

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,754
Yes, yes. Hi. She's having
Social Security problems.

193
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,614
(car horn honks in distance)

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,844
Why can't you help me? (laughs)

195
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,424
No, no, please don't...

196
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,810
please don't put me on hold. Just...

Yeah, yeah. What's not to like?

Uh... I'm glad you're here, sis.

211
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:38,028
It's good to have a friendly face.

212
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,067
What's that?

213
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,737
A chocolate dog.

Why?

215
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:45,530
- I don't know.
- Hello.

216
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:47,340
This is Senator Healy.
What is your name, dear?

217
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,507
Yeah, well, listen, Joan,

218
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,629
I need you to get your ass in gear
and help my constituent,

219
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:53,963
or I'm personally cutting
your incidental budget by 40%.

220
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,262
Do you understand?

221
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,287
Good.

222
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,302
You know, don't be afraid
to use my power.

223
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:05,431
Mmm.

224
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,255
Ms. Burke.

225
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,255
Looks like it's just us now.

226
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:15,897
BURKE: <i>I don't even know
how to say this.</i>

227
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:17,567
<i>My husband Randall...</i>

228
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,274
he's not my husband anymore.

229
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,647
He's not?

230
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:25,954
His manners, his speech, his drinking...

231
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,736
- He needs a drug and alcohol program?
- No.

232
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,755
He used to drink a lot.

233
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,236
And now he doesn't.

234
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:33,318
At all.

235
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,541
Okay.

236
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,112
I guess I'm-I'm not really
sure how I can help.

237
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:42,437
He works as an engineer
on a container ship, <i>The Alba.</i>

238
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,895
He just got back from a crossing, and...

239
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,005
I found this.

240
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,278
RANDALL: <i>We're recording this
for insurance purposes.</i>

241
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:54,684
<i>We heard a noise
inside dry container C-744.</i>

242
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,307
<i>That's why we're breaking the seal.</i>

243
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,358

00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:04,536
MAN: <i>I don't see anything.
Let's go get the captain.</i>

245
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,958
RANDALL: <i>Take the camera. Come on.</i>

246
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:07,950
MAN: <i>Randall...</i>

247
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,604
That's my husband right there.

248
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,369
(whispers): <i>Let's go.</i>

249
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:15,072
<i>Watch your step.</i>

250
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,701
Oh, my gosh, something got out, man.

251
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:23,687
- What's in there?
- I don't know.

252
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,021
It looks like a big rock.

253
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:26,988
(squeak)

254
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:28,005
- What is it?
- What's that?

255
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,452
- Oh, man!
- Check it out.

256
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,265
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Look... What's back there?</i>

257
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,857
- <i>I'm not going...</i>
- <i>Come on, man.</i>

258
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,187
<i>Randall, God...</i>

259
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,187
- There's nothing back...
- Check it out.

260
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,477
Randall...

261
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,817
(Randall screams)

262
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:42,901
Something happened
to Randall on that ship,

263
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:45,325
something that was in that container,

264
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,317
and I need your help finding out what.

265
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,762
MAN: Laurel Healy?

266
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,138
Do you have a minute?

267
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:55,215
No. No. Um, could you just fill
out a form in the waiting room,

268
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,231
- and I'll be right with you?
- Oh, no, actually,

269
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,455
- I don't have time.
- Sir...

270
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:59,481
I'm with someone right now.

271
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,387
Okay.

272
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,143
I'm sorry, Ms. Burke.

273
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,077
Have you gone to the police or a doctor?

274
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,671
No. I came here first.

275
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:08,135
Why here?

276
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,346
The crate is yours.

277
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,032
I called the navy shipyard.

278
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,052
Your office signed off on its delivery.

279
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,036
Our office? What was in it?

280
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,004
They didn't say.

281
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,606
MONARCH: <i>94 minutes.</i>

282
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:23,008
<i>That's all that stands between
us and fiscal Armageddon,</i>

283
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,118
<i>all because, as many believe,</i>

284
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,696
<i>Republicans have collectively
lost their minds.</i>

285
00:11:27,697 --> 00:11:29,481
<i>What started as simple brinkmanship</i>

286
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,116
<i>on a Supreme Court nominee...</i>

287
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:33,511
- One second, sir.

288
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:35,816

- He's on the senate floor.

289
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,986
What do you need?

290
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,667
Is there any reason
we would have signed off

291
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,573
on a crate being shipped from Russia?

292
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:41,696
Excuse me?

293
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:44,839
But, please, if you ever
need someone to speak to you,

294
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:45,933
don't hesitate to call us.

295
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,326
Nothing. Nothing. I'll handle it.

296
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:52,696
LAUREL: So, you're having problems
with your Viagra prescription, sir?

297
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:53,867
- (laughs): No.
- Says here,

298
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:56,374
"Viagra not covered
by Medicaid," Mr. Flannigan.

299
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,391
I'm not Mr. Flannigan.
I'm Gareth Ritter,

300
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,327
Legislative Director
for Senator Wheatus.

301
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,158
Red Wheatus?

302
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,386
- He's the Republican senator from Maryland?
- Yes. Yes, I know.

303
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,740
I mean, I don't...
I don't know, but, um...

304
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,638
Would-would you like me to get
a more senior staff person?

305
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:14,601
No, I don't need senior.

306
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,491
I need the sister.
I'm here to offer a deal

307
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:17,476
on behalf of Senator Wheatus.

308
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,952
Actually, I'm not here at all.

309
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,278
- You're not?
- No.

310
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,942
And if your brother tries
to use this, if he tries

311
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,832
to get mileage out of this
by embarrassing the Republicans,

312
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,581
- we'll deny this meeting ever happened.
- Okay, I think I should get somebody.

313
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,277
Ms. Healy, there are now 90 minutes
until the government shuts down.

314
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:29,792
My boss is ready to cross the aisle

315
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,127
and vote with the Democrats.

316
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:34,626
All he needs is a $48 million
earmark for autism studies.

317
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:35,646
It's a pet cause of his.

318
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,436
- Okay, seriously, this is my first day...
- I'm out the door.

319
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:40,026
This is my cell.

320
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,595
Get your brother's agreement
in 90 minutes and call me,

321
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,300
or my boss will be forced to stand
with his Republican colleagues.

322
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:47,400
And if anybody finds out
about this, the deal goes away.

323
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,646
Do you understand?

324
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:50,885
No.

325
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,088
Ms. Healy, 100,000
government jobs depend

326
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,845
on you getting to your brother
in the next 90 minutes

327
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,259
and convincing him to take this deal,

328
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,775
so if I were you...

329
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:01,201
I'd run.

330
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,420
(door opens)

331
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,841
(door closes)

332
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,676
Luke, you've just been offered a deal

333
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,270
by a Republican senator on the budget.

334
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,914
- We have 90 minutes.
- (phone beeps)

335
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:18,082
Yes, hello. It's me.

336
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:22,456
Oh, Dad. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just busy.

337
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:24,137
Yes. I'm just checking in to see

338
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,010
how things are going on your first day.

339
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:28,074
It's good. It's good.
Couldn't be better.

340
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,534
Dad, can I call you back?

341
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:31,149
- Why? Is something going on?
- No.

342
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,260
Just... I'm gonna call you back.

343
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,285
(phone beeps off, sighs)

344
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,710
No running in the Capitol, ma'am.

345
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,049
No fast-walking, either.

346
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:50,480
Laurel? Laurel Healy?

347
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:53,386
Senator Spitz. I saw
you at your dad's party.

348
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,111
Oh, yes, hi. Um, is Luke
on the senate floor?

00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,274
No, he left for dinner ten minutes ago.

350
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,032
Are you all right?
You seem out of breath.

351
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,936
No. I mean, yes. I...

352
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,130
I need to know where he went.
Do you know?

353
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:07,605
Yes, he was here a few minutes
ago, but then he left.

354
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,684
Okay, I have 40 minutes
to get in touch with him.

355
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,122
Do you know where he went?
Please. I'm his sister.

356
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:14,333
Oh, here's my driver's license.

357
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,651
I had pink hair back then.
I wanted to be a poet.

358
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,793
I don't know where he went,
but I don't think it was work.

359
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,058
He was with a woman.

360
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,189
- Germaine. Thank you.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

361
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,610
No, a red-headed woman.

362
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:31,472
(shouting): Scarlett?

363
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,825
It's Laurel.

364
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:35,825
The office said you were home.

365
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,049

00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,728
Crap.

370
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:48,573
- (loud, overlapping chatter over phone)
- Senators, gentlemen, wait.

371
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,372
Do we make the deal?

372
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,455
That's all we need to answer,
and we only have...

373
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,596
Nine minutes to decide.

374
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,317

00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:58,059

376
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,082

did that, he would deny it.

377

<i>Who's "he"? And who is talking?</i>

378
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,082

- SPITZ: <i>I say we take the deal.</i>

379
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,475
All Red wants is $48 million
in earmarks.

380
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,171
LUKE: <i>Or we collect on their
media hit, then make the deal.</i>

381
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,703
<i>Let the Republicans shut down
the government.</i>

382
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,756
It's bad for them, bad for
their presidential candidate.

383
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,000
Why would we get in the way of them
shooting themselves in the foot?

384
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,963
Because it's 100,000 people out of work.

385
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:24,833
LUKE: I apologize. Any other opinions?

386
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,126
They're gonna let it close.

387
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:30,962
It's the smart move.

388
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,407
God, I hate politics.

389
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,359
I'm a child of divorce.

390
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,427
This isn't serious with your brother.

391
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:43,626
It's just...

00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,299

(clears his throat)

397
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:51,500
So we're gonna let the deadline pass.

398
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,804
Luke, this is wrong.
It's just $48 million.

399
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,896
Yes, and we're looking to the long game.

400
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,212
It's about who'll be the next president,

401
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,962
who'll choose the next
Supreme Court justice.

402
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,784
Ow! What's that about?

403
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,057
Cheating on Germaine.

404
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:05,120
It-It's, it-it's not cheating.
Well, it's not what you think. Ow!

405
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:07,449
- Stop it! Ow!
- I will as soon as you do.

406
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:08,558
Are you kidding me?

407
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,042
- She's eight months pregnant.
- Look, it was a mistake.

408
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:14,578
Okay? Now, I need to go
upstairs to change.

409
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,292
Are you all right with that,
or do you want to hit me again?

410
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,916
Oh, I do, but I won't.

Okay, but

426
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:05,202
We're shutting down.

427

00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,678
Look, I'm not here about the...

523
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:23,899
stuff yesterday.

524
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:25,829
You have the ship manifest
for Ms. Bur...

525
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,350
The stuff yesterday?

526
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:29,873
You mean the 20 Hill staffers

527
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,117
that I sent home unemployed in tears?

528
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,388
Come on.

529
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:36,101
The Republicans are just as much
to blame as the Democrats.

530
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,796
And why are you helping
Ms. Burke anyway?

531
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:40,387
She's our constituent.

532
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,862
I saw you in our waiting room,
trying to poach her.

533
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:46,104
Poaching, seriously?
She only asked for my help

534
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,692
because she knew you couldn't handle it.

535
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,180
And would you stop following me?

536
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:53,050
I look like I'm collaborating
with the Democrats.

537
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:55,510
Oh, Gareth, about that pro-choice rally,

538
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,511
what are you wearing?

539
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:03,031
Scientific research materials?

540
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:04,390
Yeah, for the Smithsonian.

541
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:05,890
Okayed by your brother's office.

542
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,310
Did you try the Smithsonian?

543
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:09,181
It was closed, due to
the government shutdown.

544
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,876
Did you question the first mate?

545
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,866
Yeah. Chuck Sanders.

546
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:16,510
"Everybody comes back a little
changed after four weeks at sea.

547
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:18,765
"Sometimes it takes your family
a while to adapt to you

548
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,525
and you to adapt to them."

549
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,390
That's what the captain said.

550
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:24,050
So?

551
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:26,492
No, that's word for word
what the captain said.

552
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,280
They agreed on a story.
Why agree on a story

553
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:31,797
unless there's a reason
to agree on a story?

554
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:34,065
Look. It's your second day, right?

555
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:36,540
There are plenty of reasons
to be paranoid in this town,

556
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,600
you don't need to create new ones.

557
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:40,106
Oh, please tell me more about this town.

558
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:42,606
I'm eating lunch, so you can go.

559
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,720
The senator may still be
interested in a deal.

560
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:52,260
On the budget. You can get this
town back to work tomorrow.

561
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,890
All you have to do is get
your brother to say yes.

562
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,220
- I'll talk to him.
- Don't talk to him.

563
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,051
Convince him.

564
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:02,708
- Why do I trust him?
- Why not trust him?

565
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,638
Senator Wheatus? He doesn't
give a damn about $48 million

566
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,390
for autism. He only lives
to drink and screw.

567
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:10,271
Now, his legislative director,
Gareth Ritter,

568
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,411
on the other hand,
has a sister who is autistic.

569
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,589
How do you know that?

570
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:16,180
(clears throat) I had Scarlett check.

571
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,298
- Oh, really, Scarlett? How's she doing?
- Oh, don't, don't.

572
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,720
Look, I already broke it off with her.

573
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:20,948
You broke it off like Dad broke it off

574
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,424
- with his secretary?
- Oh, Dad?

575
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:24,703
- No, this is not comparable, Laurel.
- You almost killed him

576
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:25,804
when you found out.

577
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,373
- I left home when I found out.
- Uh, do we really got to talk about

578
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:29,459
the whole boss-employee

579
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,475
- dynamic here? Because...
- Okay, fine, yes.

580
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:32,851
Just remind me when I can be
a sister again, Senator.

581
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,776
Look, make sure this Gareth guy
isn't freelancing,

582
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:39,890
and I'll consider the deal.

583
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,140
- Good.
- All right.

584
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:42,674
What about this?

585
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,352
Well, it's for a Dr. Daudier
at the Smithsonian.

586
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:49,047
I said I needed to sign off on his
Russian expenditures piecemeal.

587
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,312
And, hey, don't get obsessed

588
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:52,050
with any one constituent, okay?
You've got to keep

589
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:54,681
a lot of constituents happy.
Are you listening to me?

590
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,350
Have you noticed something weird?

591
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,794
What?

592
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,470
People are staring at us.

593
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,198
Hmm? Who?

594
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:05,051
Those four people over there.

595
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:09,640
That waiter...

596
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,641
over there.

597
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,187
So?

598
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,260
We're famous.

599
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,390
It's like Hollywood
but with uglier people.

600
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:20,820
Get used to it.

601
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,260
(line ringing)

602
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:27,930
BURKE: <i>Hello.</i>

603
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:30,627
Hi, this is Laurel
from Senator Healy's office.

604
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:32,245
Oh. Hi.

605
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,058
<i>As part of my casework, I just
wanted to update you, Ms. Burke.</i>

606
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,778
The crate... from your husband's ship...

607
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,350
I-I was able to trace it back
to the Smithsonian.

608
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,810
<i>A man named Dr. Daudier...
our office signed off</i>

609
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:43,969
<i>- on his deliveries from Russia.</i>
- Who's that, dear?

610
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,446
No one.

611
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:48,360
Just Judy from class.

612
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:51,600
Judy, why don't we talk tomorrow?

613
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,236
Is that your husband?
Is everything okay?

614
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,470
<i>Yes, thank you. That sounds good.</i>

615
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,458
(beep)

616
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,974
Did you see what the Republicans said?

617
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:02,824
No.

618
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,052
They're insane.

619
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,826
What is this world coming to?

620
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:07,105
We need to do something.

621
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,976
I'm sorry I haven't been myself.

622
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,285
I think I've been feeling a bit angry.

623
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:24,886
About the world.

624
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,152
That's nice. Good night.

625
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,836
(chuckles)

626
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,861
Randall, I need to get some sleep.

627
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:43,076
Randall, you need to let me go.

628
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:03,970
I... I said let me go!

629
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,140
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

630
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,136
It's okay, it's okay.

631
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,831
Don't struggle, or they'll hurt you.

632
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,107
You're still gonna be yourself,

633
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:12,513
but a better part of yourself.

634
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:14,794
And we're gonna know each other
like never before.

635
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,435
I love you.

636
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,002
- Are you asking me if I'm freelancing?
- Yes.

637
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:31,498
We're in the middle of the biggest
budget crisis in four years

638
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:34,072
and you think that I would make up
a budget offer from my boss?

639
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:35,439
Yes.

640
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:37,736
Senator Wheatus doesn't give
a damn about autistic kids.

641
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,984
You do. You have an autistic sister.

642
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:42,764
So, you've been investigating me?

643
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,644
I always find that best
when I don't trust someone.

644
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:48,203
- Okay, I'm gonna be completely honest.
- How refreshing.

645
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,036
I told my boss that
the Democrats wanted a deal

646
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:52,661
and they were offering
$48 million for autism to close it.

647
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,247
And he said yes,

648
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,084
because I knew he wanted to take a deal.

649
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,897
He just didn't want to be
the first person to offer it.

650
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,031
- So you're lying?
- I'm deal-making.

651
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,601
(scoffs)

652
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,506
Oh, come on, are you seriously
walking away from this?

653
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:05,065
People are going hungry over this.

654
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,482
People can't pay their rent,

655
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:09,856
and all you have to do is
convince your brother to meet.

656
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,168
That's all.

657
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:20,846
- He's not freelancing.
- Who?

658
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,191
Gareth Ritter. He's not lying.

659
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:23,373
Senator Wheatus wants a deal.

660
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,076
You want me to set up
a meeting with you two?

661
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,139
Let me think about it.

662
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,996
Luke, you need to do this.

663
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,449
- People are hurting.
- (phone buzzes)

664
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:33,888
People always hurt.

665
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

666
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,094
So, then, what time's the interview?

667
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,119
(continues indistinctly)

668
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:46,907
Laurel, how are you?

669
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,704
Good, Dad. Can you do me a favor?

670
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:49,917
Sure. What do you need?

671
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,658
Don't tell Luke I told you this, but

672
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:53,488
I think he has a chance
to make a deal on the budget

673
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:55,368
with a Republican senator,
and he's hesitating.

674
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:57,166
Why?

675
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:58,191
I don't know why.

676
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,618
But I think you need to convince
him it's good for his career.

677
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,828
If he single-handedly puts
the government back to work,

678
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,788
he'll be the leader of the party.

679
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,321
Why don't you tell him that?

680
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,515
I'm his little sister.
He's not gonna listen to me,

681
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,219
he's gonna listen to you.

682
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,328
You may hate politics, Laurel,

683
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,926
but you're not bad at it.

684
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,200
(door opens)

685
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,708
What?

686
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,288
You did well.

687
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,078
(door opens)

688
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,708
This must be her.

689
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,165
Laurel, thank you so much
for helping Breanna.

690
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,486
They were just telling me
what a great job you did.

691
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:31,562
Yes, I get a little worried
about Randall being away.

692
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,658
Maybe even a little paranoid.

693
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,248
And Laurel was so great
at just hand-holding me.

694
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:37,912
But now everything is great.

695
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:41,998
Everybody comes back
a little changed from the sea.

696

- Four weeks.

697

- Sometimes it takes your family
- Sometimes it takes your family

698

- you a while to adapt to them.

700
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,209
Uh, you know,
they want to give me $2,600

701
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:55,394

702
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,006
- Isn't that great?
- Anything to stop

703
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:59,079
those Republicans
from ruining our country.

704
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,829
Breanna, do you have a minute?

705
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:09,626
Is he hurting you?

706
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,537
What? No, we're good.

707
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,623
Breanna, if there's some abuse
going on, all you have to do...

708
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:15,562
Laurel. I'm happy.

709
00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:18,468
Don't question happiness.

710
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,257
- Ready to go, babe?
- Mm.

711
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,828
You know why he brought her here?

712
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:28,348
To give to my campaign?

713
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,153
He wants to stop me from investigating.

714
00:30:31,044 --> 00:30:33,289
Laurel, this is constituent
care, not Nancy Drew.

715
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,641
They're happy. Take yes for an answer.

716
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,734
Senator. Your father's on the line.

717
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:38,333
(clears throat)

718
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,608
Wonder what he wants.

719
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,978
- You must be Gareth Ritter.
- I am, senator.

720
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,752
- You're not gonna screw me, are you?
- Sir?

721
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:51,549
Get me to meet with your boss,
then leak it to the press

722
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,384
so it looks like the Democrats
are desperate for a deal?

723
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,025
- No, sir.
- So, where's Red?

724
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,081
- Right this way.
- Ah.

725
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,805
What the hell?

726
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,808
You didn't tell me it was a Democrat.

727
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,817
(both chuckle)

728
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,504
- Senator.
- Senator.

729
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,255
You gonna join me for a drink?

730
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,653
Uh, sure. Why not? It's 4:00 somewhere.

731

732
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:16,860
Do you think they're even
talking about the budget?

733
00:31:16,885 --> 00:31:18,208
I think it may not matter.

734
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,118
Hey, I caught that
documentary of yours online.

735
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,788
The yodeling one. What was it called?

736
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:26,038
<i>- Yodeling.</i>
- Right. It was good.

737
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:27,368
Although it just kind of ends.

738
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:28,609
Well, it's unfinished.

739
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:30,930
What's your next one about?

740
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,028
Melanesian choirs.

741
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,173
Oh, my God. You're kidding.

742
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,919
- Wait, you know what that is?
- No.

743
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:38,464
(chuckles)

744
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,235
It's religious music
from the Solomon Islands.

745
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,600
Oh, so you're selling out.

746
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,248
(chuckles)

747
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:45,553
Why Melanesian choirs?

748
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,158
You don't want to know.

749
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,707
Yeah, I do. I'm right here.

750
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:52,902
Okay, well, they're disappearing.

751
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:55,918
Kids in the Solomon Islands all
want to listen to Taylor Swift.

752
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,498
So you're an idealist?

753
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,703
No. I just don't like it
when things disappear.

754
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:02,134
That's a very Republican thing to say.

755
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,727
Liberals love when things disappear.

756
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:04,548
They do not.

757
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,142
No, that's actually the
definition of being a liberal.

758
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,687
- Oh, my God, what a bigot.
- Wha...

759
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:09,696
So, their culture is disappearing

760
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:10,831
- because of global warming.
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:12,526
So tell me... what-what do
Republicans think about that?

762
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,578
(laughing)

763
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,743

Ethic rules.

766
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,538
- Amen.
- Yeah. 'Cause lobbyists used to

767
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,594
- throw these great parties.
- Huge parties.

768
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:24,754
Get us all liquored up.

769
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,340

770

Democrats, Republicans,
all having a good time.

771
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:32,174
Now they can't spend more
than eight dollars on any of us.

772
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:35,918
Got those disgusting
little shrimp plates.

773

Cash bars.

774
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,069
I never talk to any Democrats anymore.

775
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:41,783
So, do they train you to talk like this?

776
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:43,368
No, I actually learned it in a book.

777
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,918

869
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:18,845
why don't you call this number instead.

870
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,422
Is Dr. Daudier here?

871
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:25,446
I can't seem to get him
on his cell, and he wanted

872
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:26,767
- to check on something...
- We're closed.

873
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,640
What's your name?

874
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:34,954
Why?

875
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,938
Well, because, Jesse,

876
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,214
I work with Senator Healy,

877
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,982
and he's looking to make
some budget cuts

878
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,302
to the security payroll here,

879
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,044
- so unless you want...
- Go right ahead.

880
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,489
(whirring)

881
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:56,180
Could you turn some lights on?

882
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,921
(whirring)

883
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,852
Dr. Daudier?

884
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:13,548
Hello?

885
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:28,655
(loud clatter)

886
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,009
Dr. Daudier?

887
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:51,681
(thud)

888
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:54,453
Guard. Guard!

889
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:56,133
- (siren wailing)
- Go, go, go! We got a Code 3!

890
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,470
- We need to go, go, go!
- They're inside.

891
00:38:58,471 --> 00:39:00,762
- They're inside me!
- Hold still, sir.

892
00:39:00,787 --> 00:39:02,436
- We're gonna start a line.
- (screaming)

893
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,930
- Hold him down. Hold him! Just hold him down.
- Check his ears.

894
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:06,053
He says there's something in his ears.

895
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:07,900
Just talk to him, just
calm him down a bit, okay?

896
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,986
- My mind. It's going!
- It's okay. You're fine.

897
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:12,353
- You're fine. We're almost there.
- It's going! (sobbing)

898
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:14,390
When is your birthday?
Your birthday, sir.

899
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:16,986
(sobs) Oh, God, I can't remember.

900
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:19,100
It's okay. Just take a breath.
Take a breath.

901
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:20,818
- (shouting)
- Can't you do anything?!

902
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,794
- Move, move, move! We have to move! Let's go!
- I can't hold him.

903
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,505
Get them out!

904
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,718
Just focus on my fingers. You're okay.

905
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:28,013
You're okay. Okay.

906
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:28,912
It's gonna be okay.

907
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:30,013
- (cracking)
- (gasps)

908
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:32,024
(flatlining)

909
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,800
(squeaks)

910
00:39:37,362 --> 00:39:40,118
No, no, that's not what
they want. They want power.

911
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,774
They want to grind our
face in this shutdown.

912
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,080
Senator, he's coming.

913
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,666
Good. Take him in through the kitchen,

914
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:47,667
and, uh, I'll meet him in your office.

915
00:39:50,243 --> 00:39:51,508
Sir,

916
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,291
you sure you want to do this?

917
00:39:54,244 --> 00:39:55,920
Do you like this office, Gareth?

918
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,389
(chuckles) Not especially.

919
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:01,005
Do you like having to go to the Democrats
and beg for every morsel

920
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,084
- of legislative clout?
- No.

921
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,634
Good. Then show him in
through the kitchen.

922
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:11,700
This way, Senator Spitz.

923
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:14,673
SPITZ: <i>What are you offering?</i>

924
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,505
Chair on Armed Services,

925
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,939
ranking member of Economic Policy.

926
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:21,749
- Not enough.
- And...

927
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:23,519
a $14 million war chest

928
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:24,727
from the Republican PAC.

929
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,055
You know I've been a Democrat all my life.

930
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,807
I know. But what is a Democrat these days?

931
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:31,385
What is a Republican?

932
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:33,229
A brand.

933
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,473
You ate Cheerios this morning,

934
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:37,457
you'll eat Wheat Chex tomorrow.

935
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:42,220
Come on, Senator.

936
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:44,947
Let's do this.

937
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:47,634
Let's make history.

938
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:59,231
(phone buzzing)

939
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:06,278
(sighs)

940
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:08,950
Hi, Dad.

941
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:12,595
(indistinct chatter)

942
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,627
MONARCH: <i>In a stunning
betrayal of his caucus,</i>

943
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:17,823
<i>Senator Spitz of Maine
crossed the aisle today,</i>

944
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,515
<i>handing the reins of power
to the Republican...</i>

945
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,329
<i>In a bold and historic move
by the Republicans,</i>

946
00:41:23,354 --> 00:41:25,535
<i>the senate changed hands today.</i>

947
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,535
- <i>Democrats were left gasping...</i>
- Where were you?

948
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:31,164
Watching a man's head explode.

949
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:33,164
Very funny.
Your brother is looking for you.

950
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:35,164
- Where is he?
- The new offices.

951
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:36,320
We're in the minority now.

952
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:37,539
The whip has to give these up.

953
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:38,625
Where do we go?

954
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:53,992
I'm so sorry, Luke.

955
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,203
Why? This is great.

956
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,312
Have some dog.

957
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,043
Why are you not sad?

958
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,856
Because we're gonna destroy them.

959
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:06,512
And you're gonna help me.

960
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:10,753
You and Scarlett are gonna
help me kick their ass.

961
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:12,715
Starting today.

962
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,704
Tell me what to do.

963
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:23,034
- (chuckles)
- (phone buzzes)

964
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:24,458
Uh, yeah.

965
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:28,285
(The Cars' "You Might Think" playing)

966
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,261
<i>And as if this year
weren't dramatic enough,</i>

967
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,582
<i>the senate has changed hands</i>

968
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,752
<i>in the midst of a presidential fight
for the future of this country.</i>

969
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:53,431
<i>Well, how do we unpack all this?</i>

970
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:56,455
<i>Number one, bipartisanship is dead.</i>

971
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:57,779
<i>Number two...</i>
