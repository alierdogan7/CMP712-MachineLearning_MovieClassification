1
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,840
Holy shit!

2
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,570
You scared me to death, man!

3
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,876
There's nothing down there.

4
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,814
I think we're leaving empty-handed.

5
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,319
This isn't about
how many fish we catch.

6
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,218
It's about having a good time.

7
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,999
Don't you just want to paddle
to Miami sometimes?

8
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,796
What for?

9
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,771
There, I have to work.

10
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,733
Here, I'm a harvester
like the Tainos.

11
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,336
It's just a matter of
sitting and waiting.

12
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:43,838
Something will come up.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,680
Besides, I'm a survivor.

14
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:52,950
I survived Mariel, I survived Angola,
I survived the Special Period,

15
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,592
and that thing that came later.

16
00:01:54,747 --> 00:02:00,663
Just give me a chance,
and I'll sort it out.

17
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,963
Look, my luck is getting better.
What did I tell you, Lazaro?

18
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,632
This is paradise,
and nothing will change that.

19
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,644
Is he dead?

20
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,470
This stays between us, okay?

21
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,122
Doesn't El Neni owe you money?

22
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,164
What a bastard!
Here.

23
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,200
Neni!

24
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,205
- You're a sucker!
- Neni!

25
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,248
My dad is better than you.

26
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,346
Who's your dad?

27
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,049
Pick that up. Come on!

28
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,249
And count the chips.

29
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,425
Your dad is a sodomite.

30
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,662
- What's a sodomite?
- A chemical substance.

31
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,108
- Can I help you, Yiya?
- Thank you, Sonny.

32
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,341
Juanito, what would I do
without you?

33
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,279
With Rogelio who hasn't stood up
for years!

34
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,016
- Whoops!!
'Again!

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,456
I'm going to lift you up, Yiya.
Careful.

36
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,656
- Don't take advantage!
- I'll try not to.

37
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,060
That's it.

38
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,099
Now the other knee.

39
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,506
Did you just touch my bum?

40
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,941
I couldn't help myself.

41
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,848
Hey! What's up, Sara?

42
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,855
Listen, the other day,
you left the window open.

43
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,788
What a sublime show.

44
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,484
When he told me,
I had to touch myself.

45
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,256
By the way,
you look good in those red shoes.

46
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,026
Sara, what if you and I --?

47
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:27,867
Please! You'd have to be
the last man on Earth.

48
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,272
Those chicks
are crazy about me, man.

49
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,877
How do these chicks know
when they're done?

50
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:42,884
I'll tell you how.

51
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,386
I jerk off, I come, and that's it.

52
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:48,186
But their hands get tired,
and their tongues get numb.

53
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,859
What does Sara do, man?

54
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,432
She's a blogger.

55
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,228
Oh...

56
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,869
One of those people who write
nonsense on the Internet.

57
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:26,493
JUAN OF THE DEAD

58
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,523
You're getting your family
in trouble, and then you'll feel bad.

59
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,397
Show me that watch, shit!

60
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,869
Hey, you! What are you looking at?
Beat him up and shake him down.

61
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,409
- There's a meeting today, right?
- I've already told them.

62
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,978
Look, you have to get your kid
out of this.

63
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,050
He should study something.
Not be a crook.

64
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,082
That's it, California. That's my son.

65
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:53,714
- Give it to her.
- Hey!

66
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,952
He can do much better, man.
You can't let him follow our footsteps.

67
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,061
He likes it, Juan.
What the hell can I do?

68
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,290
What the hell do I know?

69
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,330
You should've paid more
attention to him.

70
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,300
Play ball with him more often.
I don't know.

71
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,200
At least he's here with me, in Cuba.

72
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:16,341
Wouldn't you like
to have been raised better?

73
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,006
I don't complain about ourselves,

74
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,381
but there are different ways
to move forward in life.

75
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,741
What's up, Mommy-in-Law?
Did you miss me?

76
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,673
Thank God it's been a long time
I haven't been your mother-in-law.

77
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,747
Why did you come?
Camila isn't here.

78
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,111
Grandma, who is it?

79
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,883
- Come in.
- Thank you.

80
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,225
I'm in the shower.
I'll be right there.

81
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,184
I was surprised
you didn't come before.

82
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,689
I thought you were in prison.

83
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,157
- Why would I be in prison?
- Because nature is wise.

84
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,727
Has it been a while
since you arrived?

85
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,230
Too long for you
not to have known already.

86
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,198
When you do that,
you steal my heart.

87
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,999
The last time I saw you,
you stole many things from me.

88
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,735
- You're just like your mother.
- Thank goodness I came out like her.

89
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,004
Cami, I swear, I've changed.

90
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,279
No, Juan, you're like this country.

91
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,114
Many things happen to you,
but you never change.

92
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,985
By the way, I'm going to Miami.

93
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,820
Things aren't easy in Spain, and mom
has decided to start from scratch.

94
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,322
Damn it, Camila,
you can't do this to me.

95
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,589
I can't live without you.

96
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,428
You've been doing pretty good
all this time, so get used to it.

97
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,128
I'm being honest.

98
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,465
Give me a chance.

99
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,032
Leave.

100
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,441
Let's go for a fifth time.

101
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,451
Damn! My husband!

102
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,173
The boy doesn't want
to play ball with me.

103
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,212
Where were you, man?

104
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:24,257
Holy shit, that's a hot brunette.
Great move.

105
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,870
<i>Hasten to battle, men of Bayamo</i>

106
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:43,435
<i>The motherland looks proudly to you</i>

107
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,746
<i>Do not fear a glorious death</i>

108
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,549
<i>Because to die for the motherland
is to live...</i>

109
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,661
- Why do we always meet here?
- It's a tradition.

110
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,096
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

111
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,501
Mario isn't feeling well today,
so he asked me to talk with you.

112
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,503
Okay, let's get started.

113
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,411
Yudmila says we need more whiskey,
so get it from Loco.

114
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,706
Darling, don't you know Loco died?

115
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,072
With your habit of fishing
in that little raft of yours,

116
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,583
you're eating more shit every day.

117
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:26,054
Like Alice... "in the Wonderland."
Careful!

118
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:32,424
Eight radios have been stolen
this week from parked cars. Here!

119
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,589
We need to pay attention
to any irregularity.

120
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,567
The public health inspectors
were also here

121
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,069
to warn us
about a possible epidemic.

122
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,663
Apparently, there's some new virus
or something.

123
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,970
What? One has to make a living.

124
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,272
Listen, you don't shit where you eat.

125
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,675
Girlie, if I get caught
because of you...

126
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,772
This asshole's asking for it.

127
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,342
Look, tell your boyfriend that no one
talks to La China like that

128
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,581
because if I lose my temper,
I'll let Primo loose.

129
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,953
And he didn't eat yesterday.

130
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,820
There's chocolate here
for the whole winter.

131
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,886
I dare you!
They call me the Normandy Butcher.

132
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,201
Why's that?

133
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,430
Because I minced steaks
at the Normandy Restaurant.

134
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:20,239
All right, Gentlemen, we didn't come
here to see who's got a bigger one.

135
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,970
We came to organize ourselves.

136
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:27,917
We need all these people
to forget about the radio thing.

137
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,986
Mario?
What's wrong, darling?

138
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,968
Oh, Mommy!

139
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,334
Oh, shit!

140
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,449
- They bit Emilio!
- He's a pussy! Such a pussy!

141
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,886
Check this out...

142
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,473
But what the hell is this?

143
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,239
Oh! He can't stand
the sight of blood.

144
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,684
- Let's move it. This is getting ugly.
- We won't help those people?

145
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,150
No, no, no. Fuck them.

146
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,652
They must have forgotten
all the robbery stuff.

147
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,051
Hey!

148
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,125
Hey, aren't you going to help me
with this giant?

149
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,215
Hey!

150
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,261
Hey, Papa Smurf! Fuck you!

151
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,897
<i>Official report.</i>

152
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:52,092
<i>There have been some problems
with social discipline</i>

153
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,602
<i>in different areas of the capital.</i>

154
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,536
<i>The police investigate isolated riots</i>

155
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:03,774
<i>apparently caused by some dissident
groups paid by the U.. government.</i>

156
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,275
Dissidents...

157
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,874
Don't fuck with me.
Mario isn't a dissident.

158
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,615
I've never seen a bigger fat pussy
squealer in my life.

159
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,588
That's true.

160
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,692
What I don't like
is all this quiet everywhere.

161
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,493
It's not good for business.

162
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,090
There aren't even tourists.

163
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,601
This is all crumbling.

164
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,173
I want to leave this place
and travel around the world.

165
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,108
If anyone asks where I'm from,
I'll say I'm from Cuba.

166
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,873
If they ask me what Cuba is,

167
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,108
I'll say it's a small socialist
island in the Caribbean.

168
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,081
If they ask me what socialism is,

169
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,882
I'll say it's a system established
by Fidel Castro 50 years ago.

170
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,789
If they ask me who Fidel Castro is,
I'll stay there forever!

171
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,556
That's my boy.
Just so you know!

172
00:15:54,586 --> 00:16:00,969
Son, your words
have moved me deeply.

173
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,303
Holy shit, California, keep it up.

174
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,570
You'll do better than your father.

175
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,438
Wait here for me for a moment.

176
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,014
It seems something's up
with that crazy old bastard.

177
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,254
What happened, Yiya?

178
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:23,089
Juanito, I think my old man
died on me!

179
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,995
He looks the same as always.

180
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,626
I took him to the polyclinic yesterday
to get an injection.

181
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,329
He'd been complaining all day,

182
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,839
but since he always complains,
I ignored him!

183
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,170
I called the family doctor,

184
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,005
but he told me he'd come
when he had a chance.

185
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,977
He had lots of patients

186
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,073
because there's some kind of flu
or something going on.

187
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,281
I won't lie to you, Yiya.
I think you're right.

188
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,758
He's no longer with us.

189
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,659
Don't do this that me!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my God!

190
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,130
No, calm down. Take it easy.
I'm not a doctor.

191
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,497
You should call an ambulance first.

192
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,672
I wanted to see you like this
since I was a kid, you old fucker.

193
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,509
I have the number here!

194
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,549
No, don't worry.

195
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,142
Looks like he was just
sleeping soundly.

196
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:30,353
Old man, you scared me so bad!

197
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:34,454
Yiya, call an ambulance anyway.
Just to be sure, okay?

198
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,693
Oh, dear,
what would I do without you?

199
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,903
- When did Rogelio stop walking?
- 15 years ago. Why?

200
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,338
A miracle!

201
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,177
No, no.
I don't believe it's a miracle, Yiya.

202
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,341
A miracle, a miracle!

203
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,441
Call my house
and tell them to come down.

204
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,586
Rogelio, what's wrong with you?

205
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,352
Yiya, call my house, please!

206
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:10,892
It's Yiya, the neighbor from 8B.

207
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,903
Oh, sweetheart, not too bad.
You know how it is at this age.

208
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,633
Yeah, I saw the boy the other day.
So cute.

209
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,401
Yiya!

210
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:24,446
Juanito wants you to come down
for a moment. It's urgent!

211
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,449
I don't know what's wrong with him!
He's never been violent!

212
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:32,885
This is because of the expired drugs
they give away at the polyclinic!

213
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,953
Rogelio! What have they done to you?
What happened to you?

214
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,255
- Help me, damn it!
- You know me, Rogelio!

215
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,161
Take it easy on him.
He's very old.

216
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,599
- I've got an idea.
- Dad, the two of us can't hold him!

217
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:52,640
Rogelio, look at me!
It's me, Yiya!

218
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,335
- Step aside, Juan.
- What are you going to do with that?

219
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,470
- It worked yesterday.
- Give it to me, man.

220
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,613
You are not going
to harpoon the old man.

221
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,410
- Yes, I am --
- But it's Rogelio, damn it!

222
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,609
He's a crazy bastard!

223
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,625
I will never let you touch
that harpoon again!

224
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,971
This is not a dissident.

225
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,649
Vampires?

226
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,953
- I told you to get a stake!
- This scares them.

227
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,044
Go find a stake, damn it!

228
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,455
Juan, don't shout at me
because I get stuck.

229
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,494
This building is very weird, man,
it's very weird.

230
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,221
Hey, the garlic thing is not working.

231
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,161
Hold him tight.

232
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,184
Silver bullets?

233
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,160
Do you have anything
to shoot them with?

234
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,290
Do you even have any silver?

235
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,197
<i>Maybe he's possessed?</i>

236
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:34,607
Demon, leave this body in peace.
Demon, leave this body in peace!

237
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,010
Demon, leave this body in peace!

238
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,481
- That's not a prayer!
- Do you know any?

239
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,044
Demon, damn the entrails' blood
of the mother who gave birth to you!

240
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,624
Fuck you, Demon!
Leave this body in peace, Demon!

241
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,020
Let him go, damn it!

242
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,790
Get out of there!
Get out, damned Demon!

243
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,455
Fuck you, Demon!

244
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,705
Son, these dissidents are well fed!

245
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,254
And what do we do now?

246
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,725
- More careful with the old lady!
- What's wrong?

247
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,132
Boy, the old lady was nice.

248
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,207
The least we can do
is to treat her with respect.

249
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,838
What's that?

250
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,108
Jump! Jump!

251
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:45,774
Shit!

252
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,946
I'll start working out tomorrow
with the old guys at the park.

253
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,470
I'm telling you, man,
this neighborhood is really weird.

254
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,097
Stop breaking my balls!
I don't know what's going on.

255
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,574
This is the quietest place
in the world.

256
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,228
Don't look at me.

257
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,769
She was so hot.

258
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,103
Come on.
The cops are coming.

259
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,084
Sara?

260
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,419
This is bringing out
the good neighbor in me.

261
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,463
Thank you, God!

262
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:42,816
Mari, I don't know
what happened.

263
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:49,058
She was feeling ill...
She was trying to bite me.

264
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,896
We fought. I don't know...

265
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,806
It was an accident.

266
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,640
I believe you.

267
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,683
Come with me if you want to live.

268
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,274
Let's go!

269
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,784
This is what I can offer you.

270
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,557
Relax. Take a bath.

271
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,345
<i>The revolutionary police force
warns all citizens</i>

272
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:39,040
<i>about some incidents produced
by antisocial people</i>

273
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,048
<i>in collusion with the empire.</i>

274
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,117
<i>The population
has come out on the streets...</i>

275
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,518
- What does "collusion" mean?
- It means we're gonna get fucked.

276
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,645
<i>...To hold a protest in favor
of our country.</i>

277
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,884
<i>It is through this media
that we're encouraging you</i>

278
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,925
<i>to participate in a demonstration
tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.</i>

279
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,394
<i>in front of the anti-imperialist tribune</i>

280
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,832
<i>to protest recent aggressions
by the United States government.</i>

281
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,403
What's going on? Anything new?

282
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:13,244
Nothing. There are no cars.
The stores are closed.

283
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,045
Like in the Special Period.

284
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,580
Maybe this will bring those dissidents
down a peg or two.

285
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,356
I very much doubt it.

286
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,530
It looks the same to me.

287
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:38,969
You think so?

288
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,979
Take a good look.

289
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,222
What's he doing?

290
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,595
He was acting so mature last night.

291
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,032
California!

292
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,561
Shit!

293
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,043
Shit! Can't these people shut up
when they see someone's working?

294
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,137
You're a boy, man.

295
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,582
I'm going to get rich with all this.

296
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,953
I don't think it looks
like anyone can get rich.

297
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:45,000
- What? We have to be ready.
- They're not American, man.

298
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,799
I have the feeling that this
requires a plan of some kind...

299
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,069
...which I don't have right now.

300
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,845
Go wait for me at home.
I have to do something.

301
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,569
Juan, Juan!

302
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,299
You have to climb!
I can't lift you up on my own!

303
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,490
Can't you see
that I'd die without you?

304
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,926
Juan, don't start with that, okay?

305
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,829
- Did you see my grandmother?
- More or less...

306
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:44,236
- How is she?
- She looks just the same.

307
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:06,828
They taught me that in Angola.
It's a long story.

308
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,811
Hey, California, I need a favor.

309
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,536
Take care of her.

310
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,979
- And you are...?
- Camila.

311
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,314
California. Vladi California.

312
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,978
My daughter, Camila.

313
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,388
You have a daughter?

314
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,527
She doesn't look like you at all.

315
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,357
If you lay a finger on her,

316
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,559
I'll rip your balls off
and stick them up your ass.

317
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,330
Be careful with this guy.
He has herpes.

318
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,033
- And my deck chair?
- My dad took it.

319
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:54,974
Where to?

320
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,377
Fuck!

321
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,086
Stop, asshole!

322
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:20,165
Keep going. You and I are going
to start a new life... together.

323
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,904
Stop, asshole!

324
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,444
You shut up!
You can't just fucking leave.

325
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,510
Don't break my balls, Juan.

326
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,739
It's impossible to live
in this country, man.

327
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,849
Over there, you'll have to work
for a living.

328
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,916
- This situation will pass.
- Yeah?

329
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,385
But what if it goes on like this
another 50 years?

330
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,286
I have an idea.
We'll get rich with this.

331
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,433
You're indispensable, man.
I can't do anything without you.

332
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,601
Don't say that, man.

333
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,301
Sara, I...

334
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,968
And how do we get out of here?

335
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,129
Like we always do.

336
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,140
We just need a chance.
That's all we need.

337
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,417
The first thing we have to do
is arm ourselves well.

338
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,655
We need to be careful.

339
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:58,494
From now on, we just go out
for the bare essentials: rum.

340
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,035
- And food?
- Yes, well... That too.

341
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,698
The dissidents are not very smart.
That's our advantage.

342
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,038
I think they look drugged...
like in "Scarf ace."

343
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,873
The one with Muni
or the one with Pacino?

344
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,070
The one with Rocco Sifreddi.

345
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,414
We have to take advantage
of the fact

346
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,111
that everyone's very busy fighting
or trying to escape...

347
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,518
...and they still don't know
what's going on.

348
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,248
And what's going on?

349
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,983
Not a clue.

350
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,119
We're facing a crisis,
and there's only one thing we can do.

351
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,495
- Help them?
- No.

352
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,727
Charge them.

353
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,831
30 a head.

354
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,840
50 if we clean the place up
and get rid of the bodies.

355
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,740
Discounts for old people
and children under 12.

356
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,278
Foreigners and anyone
with relatives abroad pay double.

357
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,839
I think we also need to find
a catchy name for the business.

358
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:51,378
Juan?

359
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,413
This is another long story.

360
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:58,619
- You told me you'd change!
- And I have changed.

361
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,094
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

362
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,823
How can we help you?

363
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,696
What? I am just trying it out
to see how it sounds!

364
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,293
You're going to charge people?

365
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,666
Cami, we're Cuban!

366
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,330
It's what we do
when things get tough!

367
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,671
If that's what you want to do,
do it to help, not for money!

368
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,745
Girl, you're the one living abroad
with your mother.

369
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,441
Because there's nobody here
worth staying for.

370
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,351
Juan, you know I didn't mean that.

371
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,761
You're right.

372
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,627
Tell me what I can do
to show you I've changed.

373
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:45,701
Well, most of you have already been
in this kind of classes.

374
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,504
It's like Preparation for Defense,

375
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,376
only this time, the bad guys
are not the Yankees,

376
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:58,580
but a real enemy,
and they're here, among us.

377
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,213
As far as we know,
there's no stopping these people.

378
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,255
They want to eat.

379
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:07,887
Just like in the Special Period,
but they don't eat just cats.

380
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,292
Let's see, what else
can you tell me about them?

381
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:19,172
If you cause them a severe brain
trauma, you'll destroy them.

382
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,403
Wow...

383
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,074
- Okay, anything else?
- Some are fast and some are slow.

384
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,844
Right. Some are slow
and others are fast.

385
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,510
Can anyone tell me why?

386
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,288
What a pity. I was eager
for someone to clarify that for me.

387
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,017
Behave yourself!

388
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,651
We're gonna teach you amateur
techniques to arm yourselves

389
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,424
and be able to survive
without any problems.

390
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,433
Let's take this, for example.

391
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,771
Ernestico!

392
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,844
I told you not to bring
any students' relatives.

393
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,915
Shit, Juan, it's getting harder
and harder to capture them.

394
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,416
These are from the neighborhood.

395
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,678
Sprinkle some water on the old lady.

396
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,378
And when she's better,
you charge her 30 pesos.

397
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,013
No freebies here for anyone.
We're already altruistic enough.

398
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,022
Okay, it doesn't matter.

399
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:14,961
From now on, we'll call the fast ones
"hares" and the slow ones "turtles."

400
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,159
In a combat situation,
the hares are your primary targets...

401
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,397
You should be proud.
He's doing this for you.

402
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:30,644
I'll be proud when he does it for them
or for himself.

403
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,545
You haven't spent too much time
together, have you?

404
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,243
You eventually get used to it.

405
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,786
I remember that when the dollar
was penalized,

406
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,184
my dad had me carry them for him.

407
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,382
In case they arrested us.
They would never arrest me.

408
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,460
Yeah? Well, that's nothing.

409
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,052
My mom told me he dressed me up
in old clothes and dirtied my face

410
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,256
to take me to Old Havana --

411
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,890
- To beg stuff of tourists!
- Yes!

412
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,300
And well,
because all that crazy stuff Juan did,

413
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,934
my mother decided
we had to leave.

414
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,013
I used to have fun.

415
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,411
Your company would've been nice.

416
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:15,617
- Juan told me about you.
- Yes? And what did he say?

417
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,289
That I have what?

418
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,091
Let's go, Juan!
We have work to do.

419
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,627
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

420
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,535
How can I help you?

421
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,145
What do we do with these people?

422
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:44,615
Can you handle the three in front?

423
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,882
I can take care of them
with just a shoe.

424
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,221
Let's go! This is self-defense.

425
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,089
Hey, look!

426
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,189
Come here.

427
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,094
Come here.

428
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,096
Come here!

429
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:01,892
So you don't get this wrong,

430
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,335
I want to tell you
that La China will not stay home

431
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,271
nursing the eighth wonder

432
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,774
while you line your pockets
with money.

433
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:08,900
So, let's go.

434
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,410
Don't fuck with me. This guy
can't even stand the sight of blood.

435
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,551
70-30 the first few times.

436
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,121
Don't be greedy, Mister. 50-50.

437
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,656
No way, dear China.

438
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,348
Go back to your nest in Canton.
It doesn't work that way.

439
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,863
- 60-40.
- It worked. Come on.

440
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:57,791
360!

441
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,710
Knee to the north!

442
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,051
Down!

443
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,334
- China!
- Get away, bitch! Get away!

444
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,783
I don't know what to do
with this one.

445
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:36,822
He doesn't bother me.

446
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,828
I give up! I give up! Please!
I'm a teacher! I don't know where I am!

447
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,699
- Sorry, Brother. Come with me.
- You're just not normal.

448
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,328
So sorry, Brother.

449
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,673
What's going on? Where am I?
What did he do?

450
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:13,158
Lazaro, don't! Damn it, Lazaro, don't!
Lazaro!

451
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,800
Lazaro! Lazaro!

452
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,868
Stop!

453
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,312
What?

454
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,452
He owed me money.

455
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,178
Come on.

456
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:48,591
Hey! Cut it outwith that bell!
Vladi cut it out, asshole!

457
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,688
- Skinny fucker!
- What's wrong? They're slow!

458
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,564
What do you mean, "slow"?
Can't you see they're behind us?

459
00:44:53,657 --> 00:45:00,131
Hurry up, China! Hurry!
Move it! Move it!

460
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,672
A helicopter, Juan!
They're coming to save us!

461
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,091
Keep your voices down
because they're upstairs.

462
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,355
And if we don't make any noise,
they won't get upset.

463
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,295
So, Ma'am, how many people
are we talking about?

464
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,889
- Well, I rent four rooms...
- Yes...

465
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,059
...but I only declare two.

466
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:31,071
- You know how things are.
- And are the rooms full?

467
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,163
I have four Spaniards.

468
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,369
That's 60 CUCs.
And if you want us to take care of --

469
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,413
- But that's not all.
- No?

470
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,581
The Spanish must not be
on their own, you know?

471
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,381
Don't worry, but you will have to pay
for every extra person.

472
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,580
- How shall we do it?
- Like always.

473
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,353
We go in
and see what we can wipe out.

474
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:52,483
With ax in hand.

475
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,768
Fucking Spaniards!

476
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,840
- It could be worse.
- Really? How?

477
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,214
Fuck your mother's heart.

478
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,122
Everyone, everyone...

479
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,922
Don't touch my ass!

480
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,580
- We rocked.
- And where is...?

481
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,619
The poor lady!
She seemed like a good woman.

482
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,153
What happened?

483
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,689
Check the house because
I'm not leaving without my money.

484
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,122
Okay, Juan, take it easy.
Come on.

485
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,470
Juan of the Dead
We kill your loved ones.

486
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,413
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

487
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,644
How can I help you?

488
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,879
No, Ma'am.
This isn't the hairdresser.

489
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,001
You know he faints easily.

490
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,383
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

491
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,685
How can I help you?

492
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,561
You mean
the Paralympics champions?

493
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,293
No, that'll be expensive.

494
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,897
Iconoclasts!

495
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,543
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
BUILDERS OF THE FUTURE

496
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:01,774
It wasn't me, damn it!
That wasn't my fault.

497
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,715
Come on, man.
Keep moving and don't stop!

498
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,812
Hey, wait for me!
Don't get mad at me, shit!

499
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,221
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

500
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,851
How can I help you?

501
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,196
A cow? No, no, no, man,
that's a big mess.

502
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,288
No, no, no.

503
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:27,633
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!

504
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,001
The old man! Help him!

505
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,857
- And the old man?
- He died. We had to leave him behind.

506
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,553
Not necessarily in that order.

507
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,797
Juan of the Dead,
we kill your loved ones.

508
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,430
How can I help you?

509
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,671
Who?

510
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,980
No, no, friend,
that's your own business.

511
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,253
It's a nice view, isn't it?

512
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,984
Yeah.

513
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,994
It's a shame that building
blocks out the sunset.

514
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:24,258
<i>The situation is under control again.</i>

515
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,904
Shut up!

516
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:32,723
Vladi, what's wrong with you?

517
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,632
He told Camila that I have herpes.

518
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,140
That's not a big deal, boy.

519
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,738
Let's see, raise your hand
if you don't have herpes.

520
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,715
All this bitching
and at the end of the day,

521
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,419
the only thing that works
is public transportation.

522
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:03,328
- Do you think it's safe to get on?
- Was it ever safe?

523
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:20,908
REVOLUTION OR DEATH

524
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,515
We'd better walk.

525
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,855
Come on.

526
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,426
I don't know why it is that every time
one finds a way to survive --

527
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,128
ta-daaah -- things get ugly...

528
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,934
...and as tough
as the Russian steppes.

529
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,201
And why don't you just leave, boy?

530
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,539
Step aside!

531
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,977
Mother of God!

532
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:59,019
Nothing but dick
when God created that guy!

533
00:52:59,176 --> 00:52:59,813
Put your weapons down!

534
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:12,028
- Identify yourselves!
- We're altruists.

535
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,691
Take your clothes off.

536
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,677
You could've waited a minute.

537
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,368
What do you mean
take our clothes off?

538
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:29,246
Take your clothes off
or we'll open fire.

539
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,418
There's no need to intimidate.

540
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,871
Come on, turn around.
Let's go.

541
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,980
Move! To the truck!

542
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,348
Move!

543
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:10,118
Juan, if you cover that with a scarf,
it becomes a boy scout.

544
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,215
China!

545
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,511
Come on, we're going!

546
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,755
What's the reason for this, friend?

547
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,398
We have to pick up everyone
in the streets.

548
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,835
There are just a few of us left --
half a dozen --

549
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,165
and we've decided
to start from scratch.

550
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,003
We're rescuing all survivors
and supplying them with arms.

551
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,270
You will build the walls
of our community.

552
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,607
Darling, you have
such a beautiful voice.

553
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,908
What's your name?

554
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,641
- Gabriel.
- I can't believe it.

555
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,116
Gabriel, like the archangel!

556
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,852
I don't know if you've noticed,

557
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,785
but even though
they call me "La China,"

558
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:18,155
my hands were not made
to build walls.

559
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,762
If you're not with the community,
you're against the community.

560
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,421
Boy, it's always the same thing
in this country!

561
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,429
Look, this is part
of the world heritage

562
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,297
and showing it for free is a waste.

563
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,427
You could at least let us
put our clothes back on.

564
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,802
Don't worry. You don't need clothes
where you're going.

565
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:38,105
Sergeant, I think you're doing
your job very badly.

566
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,713
Really?

567
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,144
The keys! The keys! Quickly!

568
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,983
The gun! The gun! The gun!

569
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:01,085
All right, let's organize things.

570
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,165
Vladi, food. Lazaro, rum.

571
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,734
And you, Primo, find something
to cut the handcuffs.

572
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,860
I'm sick of being tied up
to the little girl here.

573
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,268
Excuse me? "Little girl"?

574
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,864
You didn't see the camping tent
between my legs, did you?

575
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,784
- Camila!
- Ow...

576
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,517
Camila!

577
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,024
- Juan, don't shout.
- Camila!

578
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,858
- Juan, lower your voice!
- Camila!

579
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,262
- Juan, stop yelling, man.
- Take it easy.

580
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:39,856
I'm looking for my daughter.
Camila!

581
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,597
- Look, listen to me.
- Camila!

582
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,172
Camila!

583
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:47,241
It hurts here...
Take a look and see what I --

584
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:25,612
Juan, look what I have to do
to surprise you!

585
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:43,294
- Juan, I'm not feeling well.
- Me neither. What the hell?

586
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,700
What's that?

587
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,900
What, Juan?

588
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,638
Oh, man, a scratch.
I must have hurt myself in the truck.

589
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:58,869
Are you sure?

590
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,811
Juan, don't make a fuss.
Of course I am.

591
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,884
- Camila!
- Juan, don't shout.

592
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,040
Camila!

593
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,710
Juan, don't shout!
I'm not feeling well.

594
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,446
Quickly, find something
to cut his handcuffs! He's dying!

595
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,888
No offense, China.

596
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,720
Hurry up! I don't want to be next
to him when he gets annoying!

597
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,230
China, I'll give you a bigger
share in the business,

598
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,392
but please, don't do this to me.

599
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,868
China!
China!

600
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,026
<i>Do you know what's going on?</i>

601
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,566
<i>- She wants to kill me
- She wants to kill me</i>

602
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,897
<i>- She wants to hit me
- She wants to hit me</i>

603
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,132
<i>- She wants to make me sleep
- She wants to make me sleep</i>

604
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,206
<i>- And I won't let her
- No, no, no</i>

605
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,970
<i>- She wants to kill me
- She wants to kill me</i>

606
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,303
<i>- And I won't let her
- No, no no</i>

607
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:18,425
<i>- What's going on?
- Come on up, come on up</i>

608
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,964
<i>- She wants to kill me
- She wants to kill me</i>

609
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,089
<i>She wants to hit me</i>

610
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,237
And what happened here?

611
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:33,663
What the hell!

612
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,768
Hurry!
Find something to cut this!

613
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,074
Here!

614
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,144
No, no, no!
Don't even think about it!

615
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,451
No, no, no!
Are you high or something?

616
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:50,522
Vladi!

617
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,322
- What's this for?
- For his hand.

618
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:54,986
Oh! Okay.

619
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:56,757
Leave me alone, fucking China!

620
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,246
- Good idea.
- Thanks!

621
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,983
Did you get what I asked you for?

622
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:29,461
Listen, man, I got to the place
and my mind went blank.

623
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,259
What is it that I had to do?

624
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,731
<i>Official release.</i>

625
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,672
<i>Once again, our people
have proven that they're invincible.</i>

626
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:44,142
<i>We have rejected another
aggression from the United States.</i>

627
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,281
<i>To all citizens: You may continue
with your daily routine.</i>

628
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,351
<i>Everything is back to normal.</i>

629
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,910
ONE MONTH LATER

630
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,156
Are there many of them?

631
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,299
Like the last few weeks.
They're all infected.

632
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,265
There's no one normal left.

633
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,135
I bet I can smash
the skinny one's head.

634
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,228
Take this!

635
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:17,035
Fuck, Lazaro! Can't you distinguish
the good ones from the bad ones?

636
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:20,546
Girl, it's always been difficult
to do that in this country.

637
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,774
Here comes Vladi.

638
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,786
- Did he make it?
- Yes.

639
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,859
It looks like he found food.

640
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:44,302
Juan, your hot neighbor
is a dissident, too.

641
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,601
Fuck!
I 'd forgotten about Lucia.

642
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,689
Juan, you have to see this!

643
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,143
Change of plans.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

644
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,975
Should we go to the mountains
and start an uprising?

645
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,615
You're joking now,

646
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:32,117
but that's what we should've
done from the beginning.

647
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,623
Fuck, don't look at me like that!
It's the truth.

648
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,585
I won't stay here waiting
for things to get better

649
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,321
while Havana burns down.

650
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,126
Juan, we can't fight them all.

651
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,531
Plan B,
let's look for a boat to leave.

652
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,966
To Miami?

653
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,004
Anywhere.

654
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,040
To Miami if there's no other choice.

655
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:59,944
Fuck, in the end,
capitalism will take its toll on us.

656
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:03,017
Get ready! Arm yourselves well!
We have to get out of here!

657
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:13,219
- Where is everybody?
- In their homes. Can't you hear them?

658
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,726
Will they stay there forever?

659
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,822
It won't be much different
from what they did before.

660
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:27,138
If we're going to do this,
let's do it with style.

661
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:43,650
Juan, step aside!

662
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,419
Should we just leave her?

663
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,555
What better place for her
to spend the rest of her life?

664
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,600
Let's go to that car!

665
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,465
Come on.

666
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,012
Don't tell me you guys can't drive!

667
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,151
Later, we'll all have
a very serious chat!

668
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,436
Juan, hurry up!
They're already coming.

669
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:35,270
Hurry, Juan! Hurry, Juan!
They're getting closer!

670
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,468
What's going on?

671
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,238
- Juan!
- Hurry! They're getting closer!

672
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,245
Juan!
Juan they're getting closer!

673
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:41,440
Please, hurry!

674
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,414
Fuck! Leave me alone!

675
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,247
Fuck you!

676
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,947
Juan, hurry.
Hurry, hurry! Please!

677
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,318
God damn it, Juan!

678
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,253
NOW!

679
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:52,792
We fucked them!
Hell, yeah!

680
01:05:54,450 --> 01:06:01,368
Dissidents, imperialists,
slaves, faggots, pieces of shit!

681
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:14,046
Motherfucking Russians that brought
these fucked-up Lada cars to Cuba!

682
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,082
Juan, please, forget about the car!

683
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:25,223
Primo, don't even think about taking
the blindfold off or you'll faint.

684
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,315
What should we do now?

685
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,917
What can we do?
Follow her!

686
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,021
Camila!

687
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,194
Plan C, there's a shelter
at the corner.

688
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,497
- A shelter?
- Yeah, man, a shelter!

689
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:40,664
Go underground and come out armed
when the enemy attacks.

690
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,106
Up, Primo.
This got good.

691
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,279
Vladi, you protect Snow White.

692
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,111
Hey, people,
can you tell me what's wrong?

693
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,708
Calm down, Primo.
Juan is taking us to a safe place.

694
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,921
Step aside, Juan.
This is a man's job.

695
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:12,463
See? I opened it!

696
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,132
Juan!

697
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,913
Primo!

698
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,522
Juan, enough of your great plans!

699
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,686
We went from being an orchestra
to a garage band!

700
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:35,990
We just need a chance.
That's all we --

701
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,689
Please!
Don't start with that now, okay?

702
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,631
Camila, everything I did
was intended to help you.

703
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:54,874
Look, when I first saw you
in your mother's arms,

704
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:58,816
from that moment,
you've been the love of my life.

705
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,486
Sorry to interrupt
this cute love scene.

706
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,923
Look that way.

707
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,937
No fucking way!

708
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:11,952
Get down!

709
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,056
Wow...

710
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,063
What is he saying?

711
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,466
I don't know,
but let's get in the car.

712
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,995
He was a fucking pain in the ass!

713
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,234
- Vladi, did you get that?
- No, I only speak Italian.

714
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,675
Don't look at me.
You were the English teacher.

715
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,273
But that was in high school!

716
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,943
Well, that's more
than the rest of us know.

717
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,110
Didn't they teach you English
in Spain?

718
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,655
Juan, I'm really bad at languages.

719
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:46,578
- Juan, ask him what's going on.
- That's all I can say in English.

720
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:50,708
Juan, our lives are at risk,
so cooperate.

721
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:56,915
What are they?

722
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,959
Possessed people?
Werewolves? Vampires?

723
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,687
Dissidents? Lobsters?

724
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,473
And? What did he say?

725
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,307
Something about Old Havana.

726
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,108
Yes, I understood that, too.

727
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:54,806
- Yeah.
- Okay.

728
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,383
Okay.
Then ask him how to stop them.

729
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,508
You asshole!

730
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:32,677
I didn't mean to.

731
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,278
Juan, these friends of yours
give me the creeps!

732
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:38,415
- So, what did he say?
- He had a plan.

733
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:39,618
Fuck!
Don't look at me like that!

734
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:42,218
This cocksucker killed him
before he told me what it was!

735
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,388
Juan, apologizing
won't bring him back.

736
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:46,591
Take it easy!

737
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,396
Let me sit
and think about our next move.

738
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,563
- Kids, I --
- Lazaro...

739
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,607
...you're disgusting!

740
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:58,501
Man, you sure know
how to screw things up!

741
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:17,691
Boy, why don't we take one of those
cars and we arm it -- I don't know --

742
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:18,423
like a tank.

743
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,625
We add on some metal sheets...

744
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:24,499
I mean, an amphibian.

745
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:28,598
And there must be enough food
in this building to take with us.

746
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:32,873
Fuck, Brother, that sounds
like something we can do.

747
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,072
Right?

748
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,581
Juan, there's something else.

749
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,812
Tell me, tell me. If you're going
to go on like this, shoot.

750
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:47,787
No, Brother, no.

751
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,486
Yes.

752
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,692
I don't care if I die.

753
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:57,599
What I would hate is waking up
next to you guys like this.

754
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:01,002
Lazaro, you can't ask me to do that.

755
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:07,607
And why not? I'd hit you
with the machete without mercy.

756
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,180
Really?

757
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,944
Sure.

758
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:18,281
Well, okay, I'll do it.

759
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,053
Is there anything
you want to do before?

760
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:29,067
I'd like to see one last sunrise.

761
01:15:55,551 --> 01:16:00,296
- How do you want me to do it?
- I don't understand.

762
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:05,099
Should I smash your head
with my paddle,

763
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:07,764
drop you from the building,
chop you with a machete?

764
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,844
How do you want me to do it?

765
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,413
On the head, with the paddle.

766
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,384
But, please, don't hit my face.

767
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:23,047
I was in more than 25 brawls,
but no one ever hit my face.

768
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:31,053
If when the sun comes up,
you're still not dead...

769
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,224
...should I kill you?

770
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:39,031
Juan, you're a real pain in the ass.
Wait until I die, would you?

771
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,003
Will you take care of my kid?

772
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,076
As if he were mine.

773
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:54,311
Juan, there's one thing I always
wanted to tell you.

774
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,480
Tell me.

775
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,150
I love you.

776
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,658
I love you, too, Brother.

777
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,996
No, you don't understand.
I love you.

778
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,574
Come on, Lazaro...

779
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,974
I hid this from you this whole time,
but now, who cares?

780
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,068
I love you. I really love you.

781
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:27,579
- Are you angry at me?
- No, not angry. Not at all.

782
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:34,654
Would you let me give you
a blow job?

783
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:36,994
Be careful, man!

784
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,361
Be careful or you won't see
the sunrise!

785
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:42,401
I'm sure I won't see it.
So, who cares?

786
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:47,770
Come on, just a taste.

787
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:52,704
Juan, you can't refuse
a dying man a favor.

788
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:56,271
Come on, don't be mean.

789
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,254
Okay, go ahead!
Nobody will know anyway.

790
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,900
I fucking gotcha, Brother!

791
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:24,535
Man, you're a huge faggot!

792
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:26,705
You shit-head!

793
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,742
You're a real dirty bastard.

794
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:46,631
You're just like those
metro sexual men.

795
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:57,873
You're a good friend, Juan.
No doubt about that.

796
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:13,726
Don't touch me.
I'm not totally convinced yet.

797
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:17,887
Free Havana

798
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:15,680
Fuck, dickhead, faggot!
You hit me hard!

799
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:17,323
But what happened?
Why aren't you dead?

800
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,356
What the fuck do I know, man?

801
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:23,361
Are you a 100 percent sure
they bit you?

802
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,694
30.

803
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:33,796
Come on, let's go. We have
to make sure the kids are okay.

804
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,010
Get up. Move.

805
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,016
We have a lot of things to search for.

806
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,676
I have a plan.

807
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,722
Of all the crazy ideas you ever had,
I think this is the worst one.

808
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,491
I know.

809
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:42,170
Do you think the same thing
is going on outside?

810
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:43,971
I don't know.

811
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,006
Do you think mom is fine?

812
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,649
I don't know.

813
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,989
We'll get out of this, right?

814
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,016
Are you sure about this, Juan?

815
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:36,152
In the end, this is a fucking island
and the only way out is by sea.

816
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:44,837
How are you feeling?

817
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:48,738
Just like when I came into the world.
Full of shit and piss.

818
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:52,744
Let's see what we're made of.

819
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:06,086
Iconoclasts! Faggots!

820
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:11,496
Anarchic dissidents!

821
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:28,133
- Will it be enough with these guys?
- I hope so.

822
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:33,110
Help! Help!

823
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:36,648
Help!

824
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:40,743
- Motherfucker!
- Help!

825
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:44,346
- You go on, and I'll reach you later.
- You sure?

826
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,581
Are you okay?
Did they bite you?

827
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,092
My dad tried to bite me,
but I escaped.

828
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:56,628
Okay, close your eyes.

829
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,909
Sodomite!

830
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,428
Cross your fingers.

831
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:48,869
Damn it, Juan!

832
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:08,292
Get in, Juan.

833
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:26,603
Juan! Juan, you can't do this!

834
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:29,214
Actually, I should've done it
from the beginning.

835
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,113
Maybe things wouldn't
have turned out so bad.

836
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:33,582
Juan, don't be such a jerk.
Get in the car. Come on!

837
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:36,221
I'm a survivor.

838
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:41,385
I survived Mariel, I survived Angola,
I survived the Special Period,

839
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,462
and this thing that came afterward.

840
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:46,031
And I will survive this.

841
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:50,091
Maybe people will see me
and join me to help.

842
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:53,796
I'm fine here. I like it here.

843
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,102
Over there, you have your mother.

844
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:58,609
She'll take care of you.

845
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,805
Will you give your mom a kiss
for me?

846
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,108
Dad, please...

847
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:07,485
It's the first time you call me that.

848
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,351
Take care of her, okay?

849
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:15,690
Shit, you make a good couple.

850
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:16,784
If you touch her,
I'll cut your dick off!

851
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:24,702
And now, get the hell out of here
or I'll start crying.

852
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:44,213
I'll be all right.

853
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:54,191
