1
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
- Not a single thing.
- What do we do?

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,917
Police line.
No one goes in or out!

3
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,292
But there are other entrances.

4
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Just make it look good.

5
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,750
How are you, Mrs Denning?

6
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,750
We haven't found them.

7
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,667
Not him, nor the others.

8
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>Our town has been dead
for six years.</i>

9
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,583
<i>At first we blamed
the closing of the mine.</i>

10
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,000
<i>The lack of jobs.</i>

11
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,583
<i>The lack of money.
The lack of everything.</i>

12
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,792
<i>But then we had much worse to blame.
For something had come to Cold Rock.</i>

13
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:22,083
<i>Something bad that was
destroying our town even more.</i>

14
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:27,375
<i>That morning, nobody knew that
Cold Rock case was reaching its conclusion.</i>

15
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,084
Don't drink out on the street, Rolly!

16
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,667
What street?

17
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,334
Julia!

18
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,625
Julia, some help here, please!

19
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,500
What happened?

20
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,125
I don't know. She started screaming
all of the sudden, out of nowhere.

21
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,417
- How long has she been like this?
- I don't know.

22
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:29,125
- Oh my god!
- You didn't know?

23
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm not equipped for this, Tracy.

24
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,084
Push! Keep doing it.
Good, good.

25
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:39,792
When the contraction comes again,
push where you feel my fingers.

26
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:43,584
Push where my fingers are. Down.
Push deep and down. Push!

27
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,000
- Push.
- I can't!

28
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,375
You're doing it.
Keep doing it. Very good.

29
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,875
Do it again.

30
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:59,792
C'mon! Here it comes.
Good girl! That's it!

31
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,292
Okay.

32
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,959
It's breech. Which means
the feet are coming first.

33
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:10,167
But that's fine. I just need you
to push really hard.

34
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,459
- I can't.
- Really big push for me.

35
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,959
Push! Push, Carol!

36
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,667
You did it! There it is!

37
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,167
You did it.

38
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,125
Why is there no sound?

39
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:37,334
- The baby is fine. It's good.
- Take her outta here.

40
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,625
Good work, honey.
That is my girl!

41
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,125
You did such a good job.
- But the baby...

42
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,542
I know, honey. Julia is gonna take
very good care of her, I promise you.

43
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,709
C'mon.

44
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,042
Open your eyes. C'mon.

45
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,209
Take a breath.
You can make it.

46
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,125
C'mon, breathe.
C'mon now, breathe.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Breathe. Come on.

48
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay. Come on.

49
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,709
Breathe. Breathe.

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,084
You can do this.
C'mon, you can make it.

51
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:26,209
Open your eyes.

52
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,292
There you are!

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,792
Hello.

54
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,959
It's a big boy.

55
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,875
No hospital, Julia.

56
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,375
He needs monitoring, Tracy.

57
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,875
No. No way.

58
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:15,125
Steven.

59
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,750
That bastard never made a secret
of a fact that he likes my girls.

60
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,625
He's always parading around
in front of them like a rooster.

61
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:25,417
Bare-chested and cocky
with those stupid cowboy boots.

62
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,042
Always showing them things
and teaching them this and that.

63
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,625
And Carol falling for all of it.

64
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,334
Did you realise?

65
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:37,125
No. God, no! If I had...

66
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,625
...I would've shot him.
Bang, bang. Goodbye cowboy.

67
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,125
Get rid of him.

68
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:49,125
This is nobody else's business,
Julia, but ours. No hospital.

69
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:53,125
- They won't ask any questions.
- No, we won't go.

70
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:57,500
I won't put Carol through that shame.
She's not even nineteen.

71
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,292
We take care of our own problems, okay?

72
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,875
<i>In Cold Rock sometimes children
were born when they were not wanted.</i>

73
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,375
<i>People just managed and they didn't
go hollering it from the rooftops.</i>

74
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:19,292
<i>It may have been a bit sad,
but it was just good sense.</i>

75
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:23,875
<i>Because a lot worse things were
happening when it came to the children.</i>

76
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,167
<i>Wanted or not,
boys and girls,</i>

77
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,375
<i>some of them just disappeared.</i>

78
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,959
<i>Something had come to Cold Rock
that was taking the children.</i>

79
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:40,042
<i>Something so menacing,
so terrifying...</i>

80
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,250
<i>...that the people
finally gave it a name.</i>

81
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,959
<i>She was in her room...</i>

82
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:54,334
<i>...a few minutes earlier.
Then I came back and...</i>

83
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,250
<i>...and she was gone.
She was just gone.</i>

84
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:02,334
<i>There wasn't a sound.
There was no scream.</i>

85
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,625
<i>There was nothing. I just...
looked outside and he was gone.</i>

86
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:09,042
<i>- I just wish I have been there.
- I couldn't believe it.</i>

87
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,125
<i>I looked up and down the street.
I couldn't see her anywhere.</i>

88
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,625
<i>I panicked... and all I could
think of was the Tall Man.</i>

89
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:19,209
<i>- I think he's the Devil.
- What kind of people take people's kids?</i>

90
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:22,334
<i>- Talking about the Tall Man?
- No, that's a myth. There's no Tall Man.</i>

91
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,625
<i>- He exists.
- The only Tall Man that I've ever seen</i>

92
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,792
<i>is the one that kids built,
the Scarecrow over there.</i>

93
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:30,125
<i>If this was a rich town, we'd have
the whole army looking for those kids.</i>

94
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>I saw him two times.
Going into the forest at nighttime.</i>

95
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,292
<i>Right there, like he was
trying to avoid the bridge.</i>

96
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:41,709
<i>It's such a big place. We've got
so many places for someone to hide.</i>

97
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,709
What are you talking about?
What else could it be?

98
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:03,834
Of course it's a child molester.
A kind of asshole who hurts the kids.

99
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:07,501
- All I'm saying is that...
- What you say is bullshit, Chestnut.

100
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,292
It's not the Boogeyman, or the Devil,
or any of that old wives tale crap.

101
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,501
Tall Man my ass.
The guy's got a name,

102
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:16,709
and he'll shit himself like anyone else
when we drag him to the chair.

103
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:20,001
You know about a lot of things,
don't you Douglas?

104
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,584
Give me another hit of that, Beth.

105
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:27,084
I was sitting back there, listening to you
telling the sheriff your nice story.

106
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:31,167
All I'm saying is you aren't here
to catch a ghost. Right?

107
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,167
Noted.

108
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,876
I was just making conversation.

109
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,584
Cheers.

110
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:40,667
Yeah.

111
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,084
Ladies, gents...

112
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,459
- Dark knight is back?
- Arrived this morning.

113
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:55,876
He's already on his fourth cup
of coffee. Short, black, no sugar.

114
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,959
Well, he's gotta sit up
all night in his car.

115
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,042
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Julia.

116
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:05,042
He'll start messing about, making his
bullshit rounds, and all that for what?

117
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:07,959
- You mean Dodd?
- I mean Sherlock Holmes.

118
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,167
Yeah, like clockwork. Last kid
disappeared two months ago.

119
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:14,959
Won't be long before the next one goes.
Dodd's back on the trail.

120
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:18,751
What difference will that make?
Eh, Julia? This town is already finished.

121
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,334
Yeah, I guess everyone
is feeling pretty down.

122
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,626
- Tell me about that.
- Mrs Johnson!

123
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,251
- She's gone.
- I haven't seen her in weeks.

124
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,542
Sweet Jesus! She looks
even worse than before.

125
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,126
She wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.

126
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,334
She wouldn't mind
a winning lottery ticket.

127
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:49,501
For you, Mrs Johnson. From Trish.

128
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,417
Don't you want it?
I think it may do you some good.

129
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:09,792
Wow. I know I might've
blacked out last night,

130
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:14,584
celebrating the birth of my baby boy,
but I know I didn't order up no nurse.

131
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,667
Good morning to you too, Steven.

132
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,792
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Just picking up the pieces.

133
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,584
Really? And who
do you think you are?

134
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:27,167
- I know who I am.
- What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

135
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:31,459
- I'm talking to you.
- What? You wanna hit me too?

136
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:35,251
Stay out of our business.
I really care about Carol.

137
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,376
I know. Like you care
about your bike.

138
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,376
I don't like your style.
May he rest in peace,

139
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,251
your husband left behind
some pretty big shoes to fill.

140
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,834
After all, he was a doctor.
You're just a nurse.

141
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:50,042
Stick to changing diapers
and get off my back.

142
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,334
- Hey, Tracy.
- Hey. Come on in, take a seat.

143
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:00,626
Thanks. So, how is that sweet boy?

144
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,126
He's okay. Actually, I sent them
away to my sister's in Seattle.

145
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,334
She's got a big house, and they
are close to everything, and...

146
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,917
they're just kinda better off.

147
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:12,209
Carol's in no shape to travel, Tracy.

148
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:16,126
Yeah, but they made it there fine.
Julia, look, I still have to make a living.

149
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:19,834
I've got a job interview in Kaslo in
45 minutes. Good pay, good job, good tips.

150
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,626
I can't be here all day to help Carol.
You gotta understand me.

151
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,709
- Yeah, I get it.
- You know, I gotta hold on, Julia.

152
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,792
No, honestly, Tracy, I understand.

153
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,001
You want me to make you
some coffee or something?

154
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,417
He's still here?

155
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,292
Yeah. You gotta give me some time
with that, okay? It's not so simple.

156
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,084
He's kinda hard to handle. Trust me,
you just gotta let me handle this.

157
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,584
What about Jenny?

158
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,584
Hey.

159
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,584
Your mom went to Kaslo.

160
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,751
You haven't been doing your
speech therapy, have you?

161
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,042
Okay.

162
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,334
I'm here now.

163
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:37,334
So... speak.

164
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:50,334
Why are you always hiding behind
all this hair? You're so pretty.

165
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:07,292
So, you believe it too?

166
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,709
<i>He was like an ancient legend.</i>

167
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:28,001
<i>Something from a book
of fairy tales, or an old song.</i>

168
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:32,084
<i>Everyone talked about
the Tall Man all the time</i>

169
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,001
<i>because everyone was afraid of him.</i>

170
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:39,792
<i>People were always afraid
he'd strike again. And when he did,</i>

171
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,292
<i>they thanked their lucky stars
he took someone else's kid.</i>

172
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,751
<i>Maybe they felt a little
guilty thinking that way,</i>

173
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,459
<i>but that feeling didn't last long.</i>

174
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,084
<i>For everyone's got
their problems to deal with.</i>

175
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:58,376
<i>It's not just good or bad,
it's just the way it is.</i>

176
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,334
- Hey.
- Hi.

177
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,918
- Done for today?
- Yeah.

178
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:43,001
There's some more groceries
in the car. Is everything okay?

179
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,626
Yeah. He's been looking
forward to you getting home.

180
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,293
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,501
Yes?

182
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:20,168
Hey, sweetheart.
That's a beautiful song.

183
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:28,959
Christine told me that
you missed me today.

184
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,668
I missed you too.

185
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,751
What did you do all day?

186
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:36,876
- We made a baking soda volcano.
- And you made it erupt?

187
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,376
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

188
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:44,251
We put baking soda and then we put
vinegar and then it exploded everywhere.

189
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,251
Guess what we're having for
dinner tonight? Brussels sprouts!

190
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,918
Hey guys, dinner's in half an hour!

191
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:09,626
Okay!

192
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:16,043
- Wow, what's that?
- That's a gorilla.

193
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:20,209
- Where does he live?
- He lives in... Australia.

194
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:23,334
You think so? Maybe he can
live in a jungle somewhere.

195
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,918
This fish can live in our moat.
And he can patrol our waters,

196
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,126
so that no one can come by,
and he'll eat everybody.

197
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,918
- Bomb!
- Bomb!

198
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:36,501
Do the number trick.
I taught him a number trick.

199
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:38,584
- Think of a number.
- Okay.

200
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,001
- Double it.
- Wait, that's too fast.

201
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,209
Okay, think of a number.

202
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:47,001
- Double it. Add on six.
- Okay.

203
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:50,084
Half it and when
it's cut in the half,

204
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:54,293
take away the first number you
thought of, and your answer is three.

205
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:56,793
I know! I know!

206
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,376
Works every time!

207
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,084
Okay, buddy.

208
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,668
There you go.

209
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,376
Do you still have to
go to work tomorrow?

210
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,751
Yeah. But I'll try
not to finish too late.

211
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:16,043
Can we play together again
when you get home?

212
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:18,376
I promise.

213
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:28,334
Good night, David.

214
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,168
What did you guys do today?

215
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,626
It's not what we did,
it's what he asked.

216
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,834
- What did he ask?
- Brought up a T word.

217
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:39,959
- Television.
- What did you say?

218
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,626
I said it was an evil
brainwashing tool

219
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,251
used by big corporations
to corrupt the peoples.

220
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,126
- Come on!
- Thanks.

221
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,709
He did ask me to buy one
to watch cartoons.

222
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:52,126
And how did you respond?

223
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,709
- I chose to ignore the question.
- Right. Of course.

224
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:58,418
I saw Tracy today.

225
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,709
- The baby?
- Shipped off to Seattle.

226
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:03,626
Typical.

227
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:09,501
I saw Steven too. He informed me how
shitty I was compared to my husband.

228
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,418
Yeah, figures.

229
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:15,918
It's just weird. They just feel like
they own a part of him or something.

230
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:19,793
That's what he meant to this town,
right? He... helped them.

231
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,501
- He tried.
- He was a freaking saint.

232
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:26,293
I'm just tired talking about it.

233
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,501
I know I bring it up
all the time. I'm sorry.

234
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,501
- Ta-da!
- Oh, dear Lord.

235
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,668
You know you love it.

236
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,959
I don't know. I don't...

237
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:44,584
- How much? Tell me when.
- Just a... when.

238
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:47,376
This is gonna give me
such a headache.

239
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:49,584
Just drink it.
It'll make it go away.

240
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:52,668
I don't think I can drink that.
This really...

241
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,043
I'm okay. I know I am.

242
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,751
All right, you little devil.

243
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:10,251
Where are you?

244
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:54,793
<i>All we have sinned and
falling short of the glory of God!</i>

245
00:22:54,918 --> 00:23:00,501
<i>We're damned! We're all going to Hell.
There's nothing you can do.</i>

246
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:05,876
<i>The only salvation that is possible
for you is the blood of the Lamb...</i>

247
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,209
Christine?

248
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:14,376
<i>Last week I was sitting
on a plane from Memphis to Orlando.</i>

249
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:17,793
<i>A gentleman was sitting
next to me, a very kind man.</i>

250
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:22,876
<i>He looked at me and he said:
"Pastor, I do good works."</i>

251
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:27,459
<i>"I take care of my family.
I look after my friends."</i>

252
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:30,876
<i>I looked him square in the eye
and said: "That's marvelous!"</i>

253
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,168
<i>"Tell the Devil about it,
cause you're going to Hell!"</i>

254
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,043
Oh my God! Christine!

255
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:20,210
Tell me. Tell me.

256
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:40,293
David? David?

257
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,210
David?

258
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,793
David!

259
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,876
David?

260
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Okay.

261
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,376
Tell me. Tell me.

262
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
David!

263
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,626
David!

264
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,418
Stop!

265
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,543
David! David!

266
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:07,543
<i>...difficulties we find here
is the lack of resolution.</i>

267
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:11,626
<i>A child goes missing without
a trace. There's no closure.</i>

268
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,918
<i>It's so frustrating.
You would think that...</i>

269
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:43,835
David!

270
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,043
David!

271
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,627
Mrs Denning?

272
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,127
Shit!

273
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,627
Mrs Denning?

274
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:49,293
Here, let me help you.

275
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:52,418
Okay. Can you stand?

276
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:00,710
<i>Lieutenant, request received.
Central is sending reinforcement.</i>

277
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:03,377
<i>Two cars. They're
leaving Seattle right now.</i>

278
00:38:03,502 --> 00:38:07,085
<i>ETA two hours.
Repeat, ETA two hours.</i>

279
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:14,085
<i>Dodd, I'm on my way.
I'm on the highway already.</i>

280
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,377
That was the guy
we're looking for, right?

281
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:21,794
<i>I'm on my way too, lieutenant.
Going as fast as I can.</i>

282
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:27,877
We're gonna get that son of a bitch.

283
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,127
Come on. You are gonna be okay.

284
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,960
You're gonna be just fine.

285
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,752
Damn!

286
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,335
- We've got an emergency here.
- Oh my God!

287
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,210
Julia! What happened to you?

288
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:15,419
I found her on a road. Asshole
who did this is still out there.

289
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:19,502
You want me to go with you?

290
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:22,919
No, you stay here. Get an ambulance.
Take care of her.

291
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,502
Are you sure?

292
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:28,627
Everything will be alright.

293
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:40,710
Hey! Give it a rest.

294
00:39:41,794 --> 00:39:44,377
Give us some space.

295
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:49,669
- You're hurt, sweety.
- What happened, Julia?

296
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:59,377
It's okay.

297
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:03,169
It's okay.

298
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:08,460
Now, you wait right here.
I'll be right back.

299
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:45,752
Go get cleaned up.

300
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:49,210
I left a towel and some
clean clothes in my office.

301
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:53,544
And when you're done, maybe
you can tell me what's going on.

302
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,210
Thank you.

303
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,794
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

304
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:35,002
<i>Be careful, sheriff.
Think about your pension.</i>

305
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:37,585
<i>How far are you away from
retirement? Eight months?</i>

306
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:39,877
<i>We gotta warn
the department of Pittsville.</i>

307
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,460
<i>Yeah, they're armed
with two white rabbits.</i>

308
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,377
<i>- Wasn't supposed to happen like this.
- That's why you have to go to the mine.</i>

309
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,960
- I wanna know what she's up to.
- Jesus Christ!

310
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:50,085
- We're on the same boat, brother.
- Don't 'brother' me, you prick!

311
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:52,169
I have to think.
Let me think!

312
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,544
Yeah, you do that.

313
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:09,585
She's looking at the kid's picture.

314
00:43:10,002 --> 00:43:12,169
She suspects something,
I can tell you.

315
00:43:12,377 --> 00:43:14,377
What do we do?

316
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:18,169
- I'll go get her.
- Don't move.

317
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,169
Take a seat.

318
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:00,419
Shit!

319
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,252
She's left.
That bitch is in the forest!

320
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:11,210
Grab what you need
out of your trucks.

321
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:15,335
Steven, I need you to take that
group, take them into the forest.

322
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,335
You find her, you bring her to me.
- I'll find her.

323
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:22,627
Don't do anything stupid. You find her,
you hang onto her. Then leave it to me.

324
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:32,794
You still need to think, big boy?

325
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,710
C'mon, all of us! Let's go!

326
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:39,210
She's not gonna go far.
We'll stop her now!

327
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,794
<i>Sheriff, this is Campbell.</i>

328
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:55,502
<i>We just received the call
from central in Seattle.</i>

329
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,085
<i>They're sending reinforcement.</i>

330
00:44:58,169 --> 00:45:02,294
<i>It sounds like Dodd is chasing
our guy. Are you hearing this?</i>

331
00:45:19,377 --> 00:45:21,752
<i>Do you copy, sheriff?</i>

332
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:23,961
Yeah, yeah, I'm copying.

333
00:45:24,044 --> 00:45:26,752
Asshole. How am I even
supposed to do this job?

334
00:45:26,836 --> 00:45:29,669
I've got two lousy cars,
I've got a useless deputy.

335
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:16,502
No, no, she's not caught.
She's hiding in the forest.

336
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:20,086
They'll get her.
You stay put. I'll call you.

337
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:43,294
David?

338
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,627
Mommy!

339
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,544
It's all over, angel.

340
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,919
Everything's okay.

341
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:50,627
She scares me.

342
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:54,836
It's all over, baby.
It's all over.

343
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:39,461
It took me an hour
to calm him down.

344
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:42,961
Just to get him to recognize me.

345
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:47,669
Do you know how a mother feels
when her child does not recognize her?

346
00:51:48,669 --> 00:51:53,169
He'd been brainwashed.
You told him I was gone.

347
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:58,044
What the fuck are you up to?

348
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:05,044
Last night,

349
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:07,753
like almost every night,

350
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:12,044
I went into the woods to try
to find the bastard who took my son.

351
00:52:12,753 --> 00:52:14,628
Tall Man.

352
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:18,461
Old lady Ashcroft said
she'd seen him twice at nightfall.

353
00:52:18,628 --> 00:52:20,753
So I walked.

354
00:52:20,919 --> 00:52:22,919
I walked.

355
00:52:23,128 --> 00:52:25,544
And I walked.

356
00:52:26,044 --> 00:52:29,211
And then by chance
I came to your house.

357
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:35,836
Chance or intuition,
call it what you like.

358
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:41,211
And he was there.

359
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:44,503
I couldn't believe it,
but he was there.

360
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:47,919
I went round and around
and around in my head,

361
00:52:48,211 --> 00:52:50,794
trying to make sense of it.

362
00:52:51,128 --> 00:52:53,503
Did I dream that?

363
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:57,503
My mind turned to Trish.

364
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:01,878
She made an altar for him,
like she did for all the others.

365
00:53:02,086 --> 00:53:05,378
Four candles and prayers
for his return.

366
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:08,586
When you talk to Trish, she listens.

367
00:53:09,878 --> 00:53:12,794
She never saw me as a freak.

368
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:19,294
She wasn't the first one I saw.

369
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:24,669
When I looked into your eyes,
I knew I wasn't mad.

370
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:29,086
It wasn't enough for you
to see me like that.

371
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:31,753
You had to offer me
your God damn coffee.

372
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:35,544
It's your innocent air
and your angel face, right?

373
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:39,378
Were you worried?
Did you feel guilty?

374
00:53:40,044 --> 00:53:43,461
Or are you just the most cynical
bitch the world has ever seen

375
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:47,253
that you offer a coffee to a woman
whose child you kidnapped.

376
00:53:50,753 --> 00:53:55,336
I waited for you to leave.
I waited for the diner to empty.

377
00:53:56,253 --> 00:53:58,753
At first Trish didn't believe me.

378
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,836
People around here
all trust you, Julia Denning.

379
00:54:01,919 --> 00:54:04,753
But I talked and I talked,

380
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:08,128
and I talked, until she
started to have doubts.

381
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,628
And when they were big enough,

382
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,836
just big enough, I told her
I was gonna get my kid back.

383
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:16,628
And she said "You're gonna
break into Julia's house?"

384
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:20,711
and I said "If he's not there, you can
drive me to the loony bin yourself."

385
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:23,794
She decided to keep
the diner open all night.

386
00:54:24,003 --> 00:54:27,503
Waiting up for my news with
some of the other regulars.

387
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,711
But it's not me they saw arriving.

388
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:37,419
When I saw you
at the window with my son,

389
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:41,003
I thought about calling the cops.
But I don't trust them.

390
00:54:41,503 --> 00:54:45,878
All they've ever done for me is kick me
out of my house. They don't care.

391
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:50,294
Look where they forced me
to live with my son!

392
00:54:52,086 --> 00:54:55,878
You took my baby away.
And the other children too.

393
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,461
Where are they?
Where are the other kids?

394
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:05,169
Julia, you tell me what you've
done with the other children,

395
00:55:05,253 --> 00:55:07,753
or I swear you'll die.

396
00:55:09,253 --> 00:55:12,086
I gave them to the Tall Man.

397
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:15,669
Who is he?

398
00:55:15,878 --> 00:55:18,169
Don't you know?

399
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:21,669
The whole town is talking about him.

400
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:27,669
Don't mess with me, Julia.
Who is he?

401
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:32,628
He is the one
everyone's talking about.

402
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:45,128
Mommy?

403
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:52,711
Come here, angel.

404
00:55:54,836 --> 00:55:57,711
She won't hurt you anymore.

405
00:55:58,628 --> 00:56:02,336
Look at my son, Julia,
and tell him you lied.

406
00:56:02,628 --> 00:56:06,711
Tell him you're nothing to him.
He has to hear it from you.

407
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:47,378
David!

408
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:06,836
David!

409
00:58:18,878 --> 00:58:20,461
No!

410
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:26,086
Let go! No!

411
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:49,461
Where did you learn
how to do that?

412
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:01,920
<i>This evening police scanners
are very busy indeed.</i>

413
00:59:02,045 --> 00:59:04,420
<i>We have noticed
a lot of increased traffic.</i>

414
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:07,628
<i>FBI presence in town, and our
news reporter Amy Wilkinson...</i>

415
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,836
<i>- ...can you hear me?
- Yes David, hello, hi.</i>

416
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:17,503
<i>Yes, it seems that things are
finally starting to happen here...</i>

417
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,503
Thank God, you did it!

418
00:59:34,711 --> 00:59:37,711
- He's never going back there.
- What happened?

419
00:59:38,003 --> 00:59:41,878
We don't have any time.
The whole town will be here soon.

420
00:59:43,086 --> 00:59:45,378
It's over.

421
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,586
Go home, Jenny.

422
00:59:56,795 --> 00:59:59,961
Just go home and don't say
anything to anyone.

423
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:28,753
Remember that number trick
that you showed us at dinner?

424
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:31,628
You take a number,
multiply it by something,

425
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,961
add six, and the result
is always three?

426
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:42,253
You don't know what
you're talking about.

427
01:00:42,628 --> 01:00:44,920
It's a really good trick.
It always works.

428
01:00:45,128 --> 01:00:48,045
I just don't remember what
you did? Want us to go again?

429
01:00:58,503 --> 01:01:02,503
Please don't ask me to do that.
You couldn't bear it, believe me.

430
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,920
Remember eating
the brussels sprouts?

431
01:01:09,128 --> 01:01:11,920
Doesn't matter what
number you take...

432
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,003
It's always three.

433
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:25,295
Jenny knows. She knows.
She's been watching me for weeks.

434
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:29,003
- That's impossible.
- We got comfortable.

435
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:32,503
- We got sloppy.
- How much does she know?

436
01:01:32,878 --> 01:01:35,503
She wants to see him.

437
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,795
You take him down and we go.

438
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:03,961
You do it and we leave, right?

439
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,628
Tell me you're not gonna stay here.

440
01:02:14,253 --> 01:02:15,836
No!

441
01:03:12,295 --> 01:03:15,086
Of course you're still here.

442
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,461
I gave him your name, where
you live. Perhaps he'll come.

443
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:29,961
But if you say anything,
Jenny, he'll come for sure.

444
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:32,961
But not in a way that you want.

445
01:03:34,753 --> 01:03:38,670
Cause he'll do things to you
that you can't even imagine.

446
01:03:42,545 --> 01:03:44,753
Get outta here.

447
01:04:36,086 --> 01:04:39,086
<i>Julia! Bitch, open up!</i>

448
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:42,878
<i>- Shut up and let me do the talking.
- Julia, open the goddamned door!</i>

449
01:04:43,003 --> 01:04:45,795
<i>You're not gonna break through.
The cops are coming.</i>

450
01:04:45,878 --> 01:04:47,795
<i>You're dead, bitch!</i>

451
01:04:47,878 --> 01:04:51,586
<i>The cops are coming. They'll be
dealing with her, do you understand?</i>

452
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:55,586
<i>Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

453
01:07:21,545 --> 01:07:23,128
Are you alright?

454
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:25,628
For God's sake, Campbell, I told you
to keep her away from the window.

455
01:07:25,753 --> 01:07:27,837
- Sorry, sheriff.
- Keep her away from the damn window.

456
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,712
They wanna tear her apart.
C'mon. Let's go.

457
01:07:31,045 --> 01:07:34,920
- Lieutenant, there's too many.
- We're not waiting.

458
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,712
Just keep your looks straight ahead.
Deputy, you're on the right.

459
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,503
When we get out of that door,
I want you to head straight for the...

460
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:50,628
Shit! Come on, let's go.

461
01:07:51,795 --> 01:07:54,795
Keep your head down.
Look at the ground in front of you.

462
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:58,003
Do not engage. We're
headed straight for the car.

463
01:07:58,087 --> 01:08:00,295
Don't say a word.
Don't talk back.

464
01:08:00,503 --> 01:08:02,712
Look straight down.
Now, let's go!

465
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:05,587
<i>You're gonna die!</i>

466
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,795
<i>Where's my baby?</i>

467
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:17,670
Okay, go, go!

468
01:08:18,378 --> 01:08:20,878
<i>Where's my baby?</i>

469
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:24,253
Let's go! Go! Go!

470
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:47,253
Keep your head down,
Mrs Denning. Down!

471
01:09:18,628 --> 01:09:21,337
Nice little workshop.

472
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,503
Hey.

473
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,587
Shit.

474
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,795
Oh mercy!

475
01:09:50,878 --> 01:09:54,587
Did you know this house
was built over this shaft?

476
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,670
There are holes everywhere here.
More than 40 square miles of them.

477
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:02,962
It's gonna be a pain in the ass.
- Bad for us, Chestnut.

478
01:10:03,378 --> 01:10:07,170
The whole region is sitting
on the same swiss cheese.

479
01:10:09,878 --> 01:10:12,878
If the children are down here.

480
01:10:13,045 --> 01:10:17,753
It'll take us a 100 men and 20 years
to find them if they're down here.

481
01:10:18,253 --> 01:10:22,670
And who's to say she didn't use this
as a passageway out into the woods?

482
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:25,753
No.

483
01:10:26,045 --> 01:10:30,545
Gonna need everybody. Get them
outside. Gonna need lights.

484
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:55,337
- Not a single thing.
- What do we do?

485
01:10:55,503 --> 01:10:58,503
Police line.
No one goes in or out!

486
01:11:27,295 --> 01:11:29,878
How are you, Mrs Denning?

487
01:11:32,503 --> 01:11:34,878
We haven't found them.

488
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:37,795
Not him, nor the others.

489
01:11:41,795 --> 01:11:44,253
Don't tell me...

490
01:11:45,253 --> 01:11:49,087
Don't tell me that's what
I have to tell the parents.

491
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:04,045
Keep going.

492
01:12:09,045 --> 01:12:13,045
Now, I'm getting to understand
that your husband

493
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:17,045
was a well respected man
around here, Mrs Denning.

494
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,253
Yes, he was.

495
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:26,712
And there was a large age difference
between you, isn't that right?

496
01:12:31,545 --> 01:12:33,128
Yes.

497
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:40,003
He was a doctor in Cold Rock
from 1992. until when?

498
01:12:45,295 --> 01:12:47,628
Until the end.

499
01:12:50,128 --> 01:12:52,295
His end.

500
01:12:54,712 --> 01:12:58,920
How would you describe his relationship
to the people around here?

501
01:13:00,295 --> 01:13:03,212
He kept this community together.

502
01:13:04,587 --> 01:13:07,504
Cold Rock was dignified then.

503
01:13:09,795 --> 01:13:12,795
He helped to create that dignity.

504
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:16,170
Yes.

505
01:13:17,295 --> 01:13:20,170
And then the mine shut down.

506
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,670
And moral declined.

507
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:28,879
And he was gone when the children
were paying the price.

508
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:31,587
The children?

509
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:34,754
They were suffering so much.

510
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:38,545
I had to do something.

511
01:13:38,962 --> 01:13:42,337
Could you explain that for me,
Mrs Denning?

512
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:47,962
Did you keep them in that room,
one after the other?

513
01:13:50,129 --> 01:13:53,545
In a real children's room,
with books.

514
01:13:54,337 --> 01:13:58,337
And toys, and music.
It's filled with beautiful things.

515
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:05,837
And Christine? She looked after
the children when you were away?

516
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,337
Yes.

517
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,837
Apparently, you told David's mother

518
01:14:15,004 --> 01:14:19,420
that you delivered the children
to someone you called 'the Tall Man'.

519
01:14:21,212 --> 01:14:24,420
The whole of Cold Rock
chose that name.

520
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:28,004
Mrs Denning, is there a man,
whatever his name,

521
01:14:28,212 --> 01:14:31,087
to whom you delivered the children?

522
01:14:36,712 --> 01:14:38,420
No.

523
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:42,295
You acted alone?

524
01:14:42,504 --> 01:14:44,212
Yes.

525
01:14:46,795 --> 01:14:49,379
You yourself, Mrs Denning,

526
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:52,795
you were never able
to bear children, were you?

527
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:58,087
We couldn't have children.

528
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:11,087
Mrs Denning, did you kidnap
the children of Pittsville county?

529
01:15:19,045 --> 01:15:20,754
Yes.

530
01:15:20,962 --> 01:15:24,462
Did you make those
children disappear?

531
01:15:28,754 --> 01:15:32,545
Mrs Denning,
are those children dead?

532
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,629
Did you kill them?

533
01:15:45,545 --> 01:15:48,545
Did you kill them, Mrs Denning?

534
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:55,837
Mrs Denning?

535
01:16:06,712 --> 01:16:09,212
<i>Cold Rock, USA,</i>

536
01:16:09,295 --> 01:16:11,587
<i>Pittsville county,</i>

537
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:14,587
<i>Washington State,</i>

538
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,087
<i>shut down mine,</i>

539
01:16:17,212 --> 01:16:19,212
<i>no school,</i>

540
01:16:19,295 --> 01:16:23,004
<i>miles of forest and
a labyrinth of tunnels.</i>

541
01:16:23,295 --> 01:16:28,004
<i>Possibly the worst place ever to search
for traces of 18 missing children.</i>

542
01:16:29,004 --> 01:16:31,587
<i>Last victim's name,</i>

543
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:34,587
<i>David Johnson.</i>

544
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:15,129
How are you managing, Mrs Johnson?

545
01:17:15,462 --> 01:17:17,837
- I'm holding on.
- Good.

546
01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:20,629
Okay, you wanna come in?

547
01:17:20,754 --> 01:17:23,045
Have a seat.

548
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:26,545
We need you to avoid confrontation.

549
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,545
We need you to appeal to her
as a mother. Do you understand?

550
01:17:32,337 --> 01:17:34,337
I understand.

551
01:17:34,629 --> 01:17:39,004
If any single remark or question
shuts her down, we get nothing.

552
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,212
We have found no trace of the kids,
and she doesn't talk to us anymore.

553
01:17:46,004 --> 01:17:50,295
Mrs Johnson,
if you feel that you cannot

554
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:54,295
go through with this right now,
you need to let me know.

555
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:58,087
No, I'm ready.

556
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:02,295
You try not to focus
on anything too specific.

557
01:18:02,504 --> 01:18:05,004
You just talk to her,
you listen to her.

558
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:07,670
You try to get her to open up.

559
01:18:07,879 --> 01:18:11,087
If we get anything, it will be
because she didn't realise it.

560
01:18:11,295 --> 01:18:13,879
Do you understand?

561
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,712
I know why you're here.

562
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,504
You want answers.

563
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,712
Yes.

564
01:19:23,504 --> 01:19:27,920
There's nothing I can say
that's gonna give you any comfort.

565
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,920
Julia...

566
01:19:32,295 --> 01:19:35,004
I can't live.

567
01:19:35,795 --> 01:19:38,879
I keep turning things
around in my mind.

568
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:41,879
And I miss him, you know.

569
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:47,004
It's unbearable, the missing him.

570
01:19:47,587 --> 01:19:51,587
Thinking about him all the time,
wondering where he is.

571
01:19:52,796 --> 01:19:54,879
I know.

572
01:19:55,004 --> 01:19:57,796
I don't think you do, Julia.

573
01:19:58,379 --> 01:20:00,879
But I do know.

574
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:04,587
I was a mother to each
and every one of them.

575
01:20:05,587 --> 01:20:09,587
They had everything
they could ever possibly need.

576
01:20:12,754 --> 01:20:15,171
Julia, I know I live in a dump.

577
01:20:15,379 --> 01:20:17,754
I don't have a job
and life for me is hard,

578
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:20,754
but I would still die for him,
you know.

579
01:20:23,462 --> 01:20:26,462
It's the same everywhere.

580
01:20:29,046 --> 01:20:32,046
The defeat and the pain.

581
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:35,129
It's a cycle.

582
01:20:35,837 --> 01:20:37,921
A cycle?

583
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:42,421
You shouldn't have come here.

584
01:20:56,421 --> 01:20:58,712
What cycle?

585
01:21:02,421 --> 01:21:05,421
The system is broken.

586
01:21:05,712 --> 01:21:08,129
It doesn't work.

587
01:21:09,004 --> 01:21:12,421
There's nowhere to turn,
there's no support.

588
01:21:13,421 --> 01:21:17,212
I've seen it all over the world.
It's just easier to give up.

589
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:20,879
I'm not...

590
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:25,212
any better than you, Mrs Johnson.
I've just seen more.

591
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:28,879
It's not a matter of being a good
person or being a bad person,

592
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:33,379
it's about how you cope.
We are so limited.

593
01:21:37,171 --> 01:21:41,962
But the eyes of every child
are filled with potential and hope,

594
01:21:42,087 --> 01:21:46,087
and we should embrace and nourish
that potential, but we don't.

595
01:21:46,254 --> 01:21:48,754
We continue to make
the same mistakes.

596
01:21:48,879 --> 01:21:51,962
We continue to let the children
grow up broken and lost,

597
01:21:52,046 --> 01:21:55,254
just like their parents.
We have to break the cycle.

598
01:21:55,462 --> 01:21:58,171
It has to be the priority,
but it's not.

599
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:01,671
That's what I've been trying to do.
That's what I've done everywhere.

600
01:22:01,837 --> 01:22:05,254
And what did I change?
Nothing!

601
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,837
Yes I cared, I helped, I cuddled.

602
01:22:08,962 --> 01:22:12,962
Thinking I was bringing change,
thinking I was making a difference.

603
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:16,629
But when we asked for real change,
all these bureaucrats said:

604
01:22:16,837 --> 01:22:19,629
"No, you can't do that.
There's a process".

605
01:22:19,837 --> 01:22:22,837
Every time you question
the politicians and the system

606
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:25,921
that makes poor people poor
and the children suffer,

607
01:22:26,129 --> 01:22:28,837
they said "no you can't
do that, there's a process",

608
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:32,212
so the cycle goes on
and goes on and goes on.

609
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:36,212
And the children continue to suffer
and no one does anything about it,

610
01:22:36,337 --> 01:22:39,337
and the world will never change.

611
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:44,629
God, I'm just torturing you.

612
01:22:54,796 --> 01:22:59,379
If you're done, can you answer
two simple questions?

613
01:23:02,796 --> 01:23:06,087
The parents of Cold Rock
need to know.

614
01:23:08,504 --> 01:23:11,379
Are the children dead?

615
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,379
No!

616
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:29,462
I couldn't keep them all.

617
01:23:32,379 --> 01:23:34,879
Where are they?

618
01:23:34,962 --> 01:23:37,462
In the forest.

619
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:40,671
In the tunnels.

620
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:44,671
Everywhere.

621
01:24:38,587 --> 01:24:40,796
Baby killer!

622
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:48,504
You're mine, bitch!

623
01:25:14,379 --> 01:25:17,171
I'm not bringing her back!

624
01:25:19,379 --> 01:25:21,962
- No.
- What do you mean no?

625
01:25:23,337 --> 01:25:27,171
I don't care what your fucking sister
said! Carol needs to come back!

626
01:25:27,337 --> 01:25:29,629
Steven, bring your voice down.

627
01:25:29,837 --> 01:25:32,129
I'm not gonna bring
my fucking voice down!

628
01:25:32,337 --> 01:25:35,129
You're drunk! We're gonna
talk about this tomorrow.

629
01:25:35,337 --> 01:25:37,129
No!

630
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:42,837
It's your fault.
Carol needs to come back.

631
01:25:44,254 --> 01:25:47,212
Do you want me to hit you?

632
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:53,712
Don't! Don't! Learn to
goddamn shut your mouth!

633
01:25:57,004 --> 01:25:59,421
Do you wanna get hit?

634
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:02,921
Oh baby!

635
01:26:05,129 --> 01:26:07,796
Get off me, you little...

636
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:17,712
Son of a bitch!
Baby, come here.

637
01:26:31,296 --> 01:26:35,379
Don't you touch her.
Don't you ever touch her!

638
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:41,087
You didn't miss me this time, honey.

639
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:44,171
Nice shot.

640
01:26:45,087 --> 01:26:47,254
You bastard.

641
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:52,296
<i>Jenny! Jenny, where are you, honey?</i>

642
01:27:55,713 --> 01:27:59,379
<i>Come back, baby.
It's okay! I'm okay!</i>

643
01:32:36,838 --> 01:32:40,129
I'm probably not
what you were dreaming of,

644
01:32:40,213 --> 01:32:43,504
but you're not a baby
yourself, dear.

645
01:32:44,796 --> 01:32:47,796
Can you wait here for a moment?

646
01:32:55,588 --> 01:32:58,504
Yes, I think it will be alright.

647
01:32:58,713 --> 01:33:03,713
It has to be. As far as we're
concerned, Jenny Weaver is dead.

648
01:33:04,213 --> 01:33:07,296
Please meet Vera Parker Leigh.

649
01:33:08,588 --> 01:33:10,671
Watch over carefully.

650
01:33:10,879 --> 01:33:13,504
Our field officer wasn't able
to give her a proper transition.

651
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,171
Be extremely careful
the first few weeks.

652
01:33:16,296 --> 01:33:20,171
Her behaviour can still become
suspicious and give us away.

653
01:33:25,088 --> 01:33:27,754
- No, ma'am.
- Please, I insist.

654
01:33:29,754 --> 01:33:32,754
I don't want your money.

655
01:33:35,254 --> 01:33:38,379
The women who saved this girl
paid a high price.

656
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,546
One of them is dead,

657
01:33:40,671 --> 01:33:43,338
and the other will never
again see the light of day.

658
01:33:43,546 --> 01:33:46,171
I know. I saw her on the news.

659
01:33:46,338 --> 01:33:48,838
Your money is an insult
to their sacrifice.

660
01:33:49,046 --> 01:33:51,630
Will Jenny be the last one
being taken care of?

661
01:33:51,838 --> 01:33:54,130
The last one from my division.

662
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,838
Mrs Parker Leigh.

663
01:33:57,755 --> 01:34:00,630
So, there are more of you?

664
01:35:24,546 --> 01:35:26,838
How are you, Tracy?

665
01:35:27,338 --> 01:35:30,046
I wasn't expecting you.

666
01:35:32,963 --> 01:35:35,921
We haven't found Jenny yet.

667
01:35:37,421 --> 01:35:40,546
I guess Chestnut is doing
what he can, right?

668
01:35:41,546 --> 01:35:44,130
I put one of my men on the case.

669
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:46,213
Thanks.

670
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:49,338
What about Julia?

671
01:35:49,546 --> 01:35:53,630
Well, the prosecution's asking for
the death penalty this afternoon,

672
01:35:53,838 --> 01:35:56,838
but I don't think
they're gonna grant it.

673
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:01,921
In case she decides to tell them
where the other kids are buried.

674
01:36:02,921 --> 01:36:06,130
We know that she's not
the one who took my Jenny.

675
01:36:06,213 --> 01:36:10,505
Your Jenny ran away.
And I'm gonna find her.

676
01:36:11,796 --> 01:36:13,588
Okay.

677
01:36:14,296 --> 01:36:17,088
Hang in there, Tracy.

678
01:36:17,296 --> 01:36:20,380
I have been doing that for 25 years.

679
01:36:20,588 --> 01:36:23,380
Yeah, I hear you.

680
01:36:51,755 --> 01:36:54,755
<i>My first mother was a good woman.</i>

681
01:36:54,963 --> 01:36:57,755
<i>Hardworking, generous,</i>

682
01:36:57,963 --> 01:36:59,963
<i>affectionate.</i>

683
01:37:00,255 --> 01:37:03,255
<i>We talked, we shared,</i>

684
01:37:03,338 --> 01:37:05,546
<i>we laughed,</i>

685
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:07,755
<i>but then it stopped.</i>

686
01:37:07,963 --> 01:37:10,546
<i>She couldn't talk to us anymore.</i>

687
01:37:10,755 --> 01:37:14,046
<i>About men,
about her dreams,</i>

688
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:16,421
<i>about her pain.</i>

689
01:37:16,546 --> 01:37:20,421
<i>My first mother loved me,
and I loved my first mother.</i>

690
01:37:23,255 --> 01:37:25,713
Watch your back!

691
01:37:28,213 --> 01:37:32,338
<i>My second mother only
mothered me for a short time.</i>

692
01:37:32,921 --> 01:37:35,713
<i>I often think about her.</i>

693
01:37:36,005 --> 01:37:39,713
<i>I try to imagine the moment
she had in the tunnel,</i>

694
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:43,130
<i>giving one last kid to her husband.</i>

695
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:46,796
<i>Did he implore her
to run away with him?</i>

696
01:37:47,005 --> 01:37:50,213
<i>Or did they both know
someone had to stay.</i>

697
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:53,921
<i>Be the monster,
pay the price,</i>

698
01:37:54,088 --> 01:37:57,088
<i>and protect their secret.</i>

699
01:37:57,296 --> 01:38:01,505
<i>Whether she was a good person
or not, I'm still not sure.</i>

700
01:38:02,088 --> 01:38:06,671
<i>But my second mother loved me,
and I loved my second mother.</i>

701
01:38:13,671 --> 01:38:17,463
<i>My third mother is teaching me
about the bigger world.</i>

702
01:38:17,963 --> 01:38:21,671
<i>She says knowledge is the key
to open all my doors.</i>

703
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,380
<i>So I stay focused,
I observe,</i>

704
01:38:25,671 --> 01:38:28,671
<i>and I work hard.
- Vera, sweetheart!</i>

705
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,671
<i>I listen to what she says,
I want to please her.</i>

706
01:38:32,963 --> 01:38:37,046
<i>My third mother loves me,
and I love my third mother.</i>

707
01:38:37,255 --> 01:38:40,963
- You're gonna be late for art class.
- I'll be right there.

708
01:38:52,755 --> 01:38:55,546
<i>My world has changed.</i>

709
01:38:56,255 --> 01:38:59,130
<i>I try to follow its rules.</i>

710
01:38:59,338 --> 01:39:02,921
<i>It's a beautiful world,
my new mother says.</i>

711
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:06,213
<i>She tells me to hang on,</i>

712
01:39:06,421 --> 01:39:09,046
<i>that I'm doing well,</i>

713
01:39:09,213 --> 01:39:12,338
<i>that I'll get used to it with time.</i>

714
01:39:16,213 --> 01:39:19,005
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

715
01:39:19,338 --> 01:39:21,505
Come on.

716
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:26,421
Come on, honey.
We're gonna be late.

717
01:39:27,796 --> 01:39:30,588
<i>I'm not like the others.</i>

718
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:33,796
<i>I guess they've forgotten.</i>

719
01:39:34,796 --> 01:39:37,296
<i>I can't.</i>

720
01:39:42,713 --> 01:39:45,505
<i>Every morning I wake up
to the same thought</i>

721
01:39:45,671 --> 01:39:48,380
<i>of giving it all up
and running back home.</i>

722
01:39:48,796 --> 01:39:52,380
<i>But I remind myself
I wanted this life.</i>

723
01:39:52,588 --> 01:39:55,796
<i>I wanted it.
I made it happen.</i>

724
01:39:57,796 --> 01:40:00,963
<i>I guess it's better this way, right?</i>

725
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,880
<i>Right?</i>

726
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:07,088
<i>Right?</i>

727
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:13,546
