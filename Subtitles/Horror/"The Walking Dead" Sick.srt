1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,451
We're all infected.

2
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:02,923
We all carry it.

3
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:06,893
Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,011
We haven't had this much space
since we left the farm.

5
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:12,067
It's secure?

6
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:13,540
This cell block is.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,035
He hates me. He's too good
a man to say it, but I know.

8
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:24,359
Only one way to
keep you alive...

9
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:36,517
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

10
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,135
He's bleeding out.
We gotta go back.

11
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,254
Come around here.
Put pressure on the knee.

12
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:42,890
Hard, hard!
Push, push.

13
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:47,228
Why don't you come on
out of there? Slow and steady.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,729
What happened to him?

15
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,397
- He got bit.
- Bit?

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

17
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,652
Nobody needs to get hurt.

18
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,203
- I need you to hold this.
- Okay.

19
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:57,771
- As hard as you can.
- Yes.

20
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:59,206
You have medical supplies?

21
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,941
Wow. Where do you
think you're going?

22
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:04,078
<i>( Walkers banging, snarling )</i>

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,580
Who the hell
are you people, anyway?

24
00:01:06,582 --> 00:01:08,282
Don't look like no rescue team.

25
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:11,001
If a rescue team is what
you're waiting for, don't.

26
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:14,405
Come on, we gotta go!

27
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:18,125
Now! Come on!
I need a hand here.

28
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:20,127
One, two, three, go!

29
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,596
- Holy Jesus!
- T, the door.

30
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,798
- Andrew: Are you crazy? Don't open that!
- Rick: <i>We got this.</i>

31
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:30,771
( Snarling )

32
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:32,740
Rick:
Daryl. Daryl!

33
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,029
Let's go.

34
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,031
Rick:
This way.

35
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:49,489

Rick:
This way, this way.

38
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:26,357
No, no, no.
Back, back!

39
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,858
- <i>( Snarling )</i>
<i>- Daryl.</i>

40
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:34,263
Come on!
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

41
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:53,985
Stop, stop.

42
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,886
Man:
<i>Follow the flashlight.</i>

43
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,208
Come on, let's go.

44
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,225
Go, go.
Go, go, go.

45
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,266
- ( Maggie grunting )
- Rick: Easy, easy.

46
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,601
- He's losing too much blood.
- Open the door!

47
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:12,120
It's Hershel!

48
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,437
<i>Carl!</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

49
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,939
- Oh, my God.
- Daddy!

50
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,491
Go, go, go, go, go.
In there.

51
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:18,743
- Turn it. Turn it. Turn around.
- This way.

52
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,712
Get him on the bed.

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,281
Daryl:
He got bit.

54
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:24,782
- Oh, my God, he's gonna turn.
- Did you cut it off?

55
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:26,251
- Yeah.
- Maybe you got it in time.

56
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,752
- Ready?
- Okay.

57
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:30,121
One, two, three.
( Grunts )

58
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:34,926
- One, two, three.
- Carol: Oh, God.

59
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,930
Oh!
Oh, I need bandages.

60
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,182
- We used everything we had.
- Well, get more. Anything.

61
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,967
Carl, go get the towels from the
back, right next to my bed.

62
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,468
- Is he gonna die?
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,771
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

64
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:47,805
You think you can
stabilize him?

65
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:50,858
I need to keep his leg elevated.
Get some pillows!

66
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,527
He's already bled
through the sheets.

67
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,812
We can burn the wound to clot the blood.
I can start a fire.

68
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,814
- No, please don't do this.
- Carol: <i>No, the shock could kill him.</i>

69
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,700
It's not gonna stop
the arteries from bleeding.

70
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:01,119
We need to just keep it dressed
and let it heal on its own.

71
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,998
Oh, God.

72
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,964
( Footsteps approaching )

73
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,530
That's far enough.

74
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,032
Cell block C.

75
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,234
Cell 4--
that's mine, gringo.

76
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:34,702
Let me in.

77
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,821
Today's your
lucky days, fellas.

78
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:39,407
You've been pardoned by the State of Georgia.
You're free to go.

79
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,293
- What you got going on in there?
- It ain't none of your concern.

80
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,329
Don't be telling me
what's my concern.

81
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,898
Chill, man.
Dude's leg is messed up.

82
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,118
Besides, we're free now.
Why are we still in here?

83
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:52,003
- The man's got a point.
- Yeah, and I gotta check on my old lady.

84
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:56,224
A group of civilians breaking <i>in</i> to
a prison you got no business being in--

85
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,426
got me thinking there ain't
no place for us to go.

86
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:01,691
- Why don't you go find out?
- Maybe we'll just be going now.

87
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,838
- Hey, we ain't leaving.
- You aren't coming in either.

88
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:07,235
Hey, this is my house, my rules.
I go where I damn well please.

89
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:10,388
- What was that?
- Prisoners, survivors.

90
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,408
- Glenn: <i>What?</i>
<i>- It's all right. Everybody stay put.</i>

91
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,730
Do not leave his side.

92
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:25,203
If he dies, you need
to be there for that.

93
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,372
You think you can do this?

94
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:30,038
- Maggie will be there.
- I got it.

95
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,801
- I can bring T in...
- I got it.

96
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,347
Good.
( Daryl, prisoners arguing )

97
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,554
There ain't nothing
for you here.

98
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:48,309
Why don't you go back
to your own sandbox?

99
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,644
How many of you are in there?

100
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,896
Too many for you to handle.

101
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,816
You guys rob a bank
or something?

102
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,434
Why don't you take him
to a hospital?

103
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,293
How long have you been
locked in that cafeteria?

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,715
Going on like 10 months.

105
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,551
Big Tiny:
<i>A riot broke out.</i>

106
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:15,753
Never seen anything like it.

107
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:18,005
Axel:
Attica on speed, man.

108
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,807
Ever heard about
dudes going cannibal,

109
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,726
dying, coming back to life?

110
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,561
Crazy.

111
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,813
One guard looked out for us,
locked us up in the cafeteria.

112
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,456
Told us sit tight, threw me this
piece, said he'd be right back.

113
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:31,185
Yeah, and that
was 292 days ago.

114
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:34,605
- 94 according to my calcula--
- Shut up!

115
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,807
Oscar: We were thinking that
the army or the national guard

116
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,943
should be showing up
any day now.

117
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,162
Rick:
There is no army.

118
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,108
What do you mean?

119
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:46,678
There's no government,
no hospitals, no police.

120
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:48,576
<i>It's all gone.</i>

121
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:54,775
- For real?
- I'm serious.

122
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,254
What about my moms?

123
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:02,956
My kids?
And my old lady?

124
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:06,560
Yo, you got a cell phone or something
that we can call our families?

125
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,295
You just don't get it, do you?

126
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:11,498
No phones, no computers.

127
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,037
As far as we can see, at leas half
the population has been wiped out.

128
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,605
<i>Probably more.</i>

129
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,282
- Ain't no way.
- See for yourself.

130
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,235
Oscar:
Damn, the sun feels good.

131
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:55,038
Axel: Good lord.
They're all dead.

132
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,874
Tomas: Never thought I'd be
so happy to see these fences.

133
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,280
Andrew:
<i>You never said--</i>

134
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,282
how the hell did you get
in here in the first place?

135
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:09,385
Cut a hole in that fence
over there by that guard tower.

136
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:14,325
- That easy, huh?
- Where there's a will there's a way.

137
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:15,831
Easy for you to say.

138
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,796
So what is this,
like a disease?

139
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,632
Yeah, and we're all infected.

140
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,337
Axel: What do you mean infected?
Like AIDS or something?

141
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,473
Daryl: If I was to kill you,
shoot an arrow in your chest,

142
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:35,310
you'd come back
as one of these things.

143
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,078
It's gonna happen to all of us.

144
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,279
Ain't no way this
Robinhood casts

145
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,517
responsible for killing
all these freaks.

146
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,653
Must be 50 bodies out here.

147
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,358
Where'd you come from?

148
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,293
Atlanta.

149
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:56,730
Where are you headed?

150
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,832
For now, nowhere.

151
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,707
I guess you can take that area
down there near the water.

152
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,942
Should be comfortable.

153
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:11,844
We're using
that field for crops.

154
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:14,847
- We'll help you move your gear out.
- Rick: <i>That won't be necessary.</i>

155
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:17,683
We took out these walkers.
This prison is ours.

156
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,185
Slow down, cowboy.

157
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,554
You snatched the locks
off our doors.

158
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,791
We'll give you new locks,
if that's how you want it.

159
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,692
This is our prison.
We were here first.

160
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,761
Locked in a broom closet?

161
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,764
We took it, set you free.

162
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:34,766
It's ours.
We spilled blood.

163
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,936
- We're moving back into our cell block.
- You'll have to get your own.

164
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:39,637
It is mine. I've still got
personal artifacts in there.

165
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:41,872
- That's about as mine as it gets.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

166
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,475
Maybe let's try to make this
work out so everybody wins.

167
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:49,980
- I don't see that happening.
- Neither do I.

168
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,684
I ain't going back in that
cafeteria for one more minute.

169
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,752
There are other cell blocks.

170
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,987
You could leave.

171
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,789
Try your luck out on the road.

172
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,534
If these three pussies
can do all this,

173
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,834
the least we can do is take
out another cell block.

174
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,199
With what?

175
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,140
Atlanta here will spot us
some real weapons.

176
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:21,043
Won't you, boss?

177
00:10:21,044 --> 00:10:23,578
How stocked is that cafeteria?

178
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:24,913
It must have plenty of food.

179
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,428
Five guys lasting
almost a year?

180
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,505
It sure as hell don't look
like anybody's been starving.

181
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:34,255
- There's only a little left.
- We'll take half.

182
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:37,424
In exchange, we'll help
clear out a cell block.

183
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:40,427
Didn't you hear him?
There's only a little left.

184
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:43,564
Bet you got more food
than you got choices.

185
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:47,367
You pay, we'll play.

186
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:50,203
We'll clear out a block for
you, then you keep to it.

187
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:56,721
- All right.
- Well, let's be clear.

188
00:10:56,844 --> 00:11:00,113
If we see you out here
anywhere near our people,

189
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,314
if I so much as even catch
a whiff of your scent,

190
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:04,416
I will kill you.

191
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,483
Deal.

192
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,021
It has to stop
eventually, right?

193
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,222
It slowed down
quite a bit already.

194
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,351
If we can get him
through this--

195
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:24,775
When we get him through this.

196
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:28,466
--we'll need crutches.

197
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,602
Right now we could use
some antibiotics

198
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:34,305
and painkillers,
some sterile gauze.

199
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,041
There's got to be
an infirmary here.

200
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,342
If there is, we'll find it.

201
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:42,012
You've gotta be worried sick
about delivering the baby.

202
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:45,415
Look at me.
Do I look worried?

203
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,486
You look disgusting.

204
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,722
( Laughs ) So do you.

205
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:56,694
We'll get through this.

206
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,463
Pantry's back here.

207
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:06,502
You never tried
to break out of here?

208
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,972
<i>Yeah, we tried to take</i>
<i>the doors off.</i>

209
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:10,740
<i>But if you make</i>
<i>one peep in here,</i>

210
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,609
then those freaks'll be
lined up outside the door

211
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,876
growling, trying to get in.

212
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:18,117
Windows got bars on there that
he-man couldn't get through.

213
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,711
- Bigger than a 5x8.
- Big Tiny: <i>You won't find me complaining.</i>

214
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:23,919
<i>Doing 15. My left leg can barely
fit on one of those bunks.</i>

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,722
Oscar: <i>Yeah, they don't call
him Big Tiny for nothing.</i>

216
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:28,590
You done jerking
each other off?

217
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:30,459
Sick of waiting back here.

218
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:58,868
This what you call
a little bit of food?

219
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,446
- Goes fast.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:03,789
You can have a bag of
corn, some tuna fish--

221
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,692
We said half.
That's the deal.

222
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,762
- What's in there?
- Oscar: <i>Don't open that.</i>

223
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:12,698
( Coughing, gagging )
( Laughing )

224
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:14,232
He wanted to know.

225
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,674
Can't wait for
my own pot to piss in.

226
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,810
( Wheezing )

227
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,314
It was stupid of us
to let him go.

228
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,988
We cleared this whole cell
block, just the five of us.

229
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,261
It could have
happened to anyone.

230
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,001
What are we gonna
do without him?

231
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:54,304
Hey, stop it.

232
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:57,039
All right? Stop it.
( Sighs )

233
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,309
He's still here.

234
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,012
What if he does wake up?

235
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:07,183
Then what?
He can't even walk.

236
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,185
All we do is run.

237
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,220
Hey...

238
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,422
this won't break him.

239
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:15,924
Okay?

240
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:18,559
He's got you and Beth.

241
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,263
Am I the only person
living in reality here?

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,435
We've been through
so much already.

243
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,870
You're expecting it, too.

244
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,607
I'm not expecting, all right?

245
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,676
I'm just preparing.

246
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,212
Why don't you go check on Beth?

247
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,180
Go on.
I'll watch him.

248
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,617
( Sighs )

249
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,849
- What are you doing? - He's gonna
have a hard time walking around

250
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:06,404
with one side of his pants
dragging on the ground.

251
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,439
You know, he could
trip or something.

252
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,513
There's a good chance
he won't wake up.

253
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,649
- Why are you so eager to give up on him?
- <i>I'm not giving up on him.</i>

254
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,485
It sure sounds like it.

255
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:25,589
I don't want you to get
your hopes too high.

256
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,092
We're not equipped to deal
with something like this.

257
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:32,962
- We have Carol.
- She's not a doctor.

258
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,531
Dad taught her a few things
to help with the baby.

259
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,366
She stopped the bleeding.

260
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,208
These'll do just fine.

261
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,879
- T-Dog: Food's here.
- What you got?

262
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,250
Canned beef, canned corn,
canned cans.

263
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,686
There's a lot more
where this came from.

264
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,188
Any change?

265
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:02,057
Bleeding is under control
and no fever,

266
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:05,326
but his breath is labored
and his pulse is way down

267
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:08,229
and he hasn't opened
his eyes yet.

268
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,132
Take my cuffs, put them on him.

269
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,467
I'm not taking any chances.

270
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah.

271
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,428
So what about those prisoners?

272
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,677
( Sighs ) We're gonna help them

273
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:26,279
clear out their own cell block,

274
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,949
and then they'll be there
and we'll be here.

275
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,885
- Living beside each other.
- I'm not giving up this prison.

276
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:37,622
- Do they have guns?
- I only saw one.

277
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:41,426
Yeah, I don't know
if it's gonna work.

278
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,997
Well, what are your options?

279
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:49,090
Kill them.

280
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,504
If that's what
you think is best.

281
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:58,042
You s--
you say this now...

282
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,715
Look, I know that
I'm a shitty wife

283
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:04,023
and I'm not winning
any mother of the year awards,

284
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,620
but I need you to know that...

285
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:17,160
not for one second do I think
there is malice in your heart.

286
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,330
You're not a killer,
and I know that.

287
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,400
I know that, so--

288
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,606
so do whatever you gotta do
to keep this group safe.

289
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,508
And do it with
a clear conscience.

290
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:52,693
Why do I need this
when I got this?

291
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:54,662
Daryl:
<i>You don't fire guns,</i>

292
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,298
not unless your back's
up against a wall.

293
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,899
Noise attracts them.

294
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,435
It really riles them up.

295
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:05,605
We'll go in two by two.
Daryl will run point with T.

296
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,841
I'll bring up
the rear with you.

297
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,010
Stay tight, hold formation

298
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:12,211
no matter how close
the walkers get...

299
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,180
anyone breaks ranks,
we could all go down.

300
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,949
Anyone runs off,

301
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,117
they could get mistaken
for a walker,

302
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,153
end up with an axe to the head.

303
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:21,754
And that's where you aim.

304
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:23,823
These things only go down
with a head shot.

305
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:26,792
Ain't gotta tell us
how to take out a man.

306
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:30,662
They ain't men.
They're something else.

307
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:33,598
Just remember to go
for the brain.

308
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:38,170
( Keys jangle )

309
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,343
What's going on?

310
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,361
- We had to.
- It's just a precaution.

311
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:57,188
You think maybe I could have
a minute alone here?

312
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:59,223
Yeah, you want me to--?

313
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:02,025
No, just by myself.

314
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:04,803
Of course.

315
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,101
I'll be right outside.

316
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,170
Dad...

317
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,902
you don't have
to fight anymore.

318
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,677
If you're worried
about me and Beth, don't.

319
00:19:57,678 --> 00:19:59,812
Don't worry about us.

320
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,383
We'll take care of each other.
We'll look out.

321
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,985
Me, Beth, and Glenn
will look out.

322
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:15,928
Go ahead, dad.
It's okay.

323
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,012
Be peaceful.

324
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,035
You don't have to fight.

325
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,579
If it's time to go, it's okay.

326
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:44,555
Daddy, I just want
to thank you.

327
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,394
For everything, thank you.

328
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,015
Man, it's too
damn dark in here.

329
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:31,017
Gotta hold it up high
out in front of you.

330
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:33,948
<i>You're gonna hear them</i>
<i>before you see them.</i>

331
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,895
- It's coming!
- Rick: <i>Shh!</i>

332
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,900
<i>( Clanging, snarling )</i>

333
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,979
( Yelling )

334
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,554
You wanna taste me?

335
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:45,353
( Door creaks, clangs )

336
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:51,126
I thought you were
organizing the food.

337
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,430
Even better.

338
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:59,100
Check it out.

339
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:01,535
( Gasps )
Where did you get this?

340
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,470
From the infirmary.

341
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,639
<i>Wasn't much left,</i>
<i>but I cleared it out.</i>

342
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,545
- You went by yourself?
- Yeah.

343
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,684
Are you crazy?

344
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:11,978
No big deal. I killed two walkers.

345
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:15,682
You-- all right,
do you see this?

346
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,817
This was with the whole group.

347
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:19,552
We needed supplies,
so I got them.

348
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:23,556
- I appreciate that, but--
- Then get off my back. - Carl!

349
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:26,392
She's your mother.
You can't talk to her like that.

350
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:30,830
Listen, I think it's great
that you wanna help--

351
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:41,339
It's gotta be the brain.

352
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,910
Not the stomach,
not the heart-- the brain.

353
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:47,946
I hear you.
The brain.

354
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,726
- Like that?
- Uh-huh.

355
00:23:57,823 --> 00:24:00,858
Stay in tight formation.
No more prison riot crap.

356
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:36,325
( Snarling )

357
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:47,769
Ah!

358
00:25:10,086 --> 00:25:13,011
These bandages will help
prevent infection.

359
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:15,561
It's good.

360
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:18,597
It's good that he taught
you all this stuff.

361
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:21,200
He didn't teach me everything.

362
00:25:26,472 --> 00:25:28,006
I need your help
with something.

363
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,041
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

364
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:33,044
- What is it?
- Not here.

365
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,346
I can't leave Hershel.

366
00:25:35,347 --> 00:25:37,715
- This is important.
- Carol, I can't--

367
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,717
- Go on. We got it.
- Glenn: <i>No way.</i>

368
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:42,052
- We'll be fine.
- We're not gonna be gone long.

369
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:44,721
- Rick said for me--
- We're fine.

370
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,663
All right.

371
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,806
I'm telling you, I don't feel anything.
It's just a scratch.

372
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,641
- I'm sorry, man.
- I can keep fighting!

373
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:06,910
You cut that old guy's leg
off to save his life.

374
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,179
- Look at where the bite is.
- Guys, I'm fine!

375
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,282
Just-- I'm fine.

376
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,917
Look at me-- I'm not changing
into one of those things.

377
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,820
Oscar: Look, man, there has
to be something we can do.

378
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:19,165
- We could just lock him up.
- Quarantine him.

379
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,557
We gotta do something.
Why you just standing there?

380
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:23,759
- We gotta save him.
- There's nothing we can do.

381
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,728
You son of a bitch.

382
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:28,397
I'm all ri--

383
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,040
( walkers snarling )

384
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:14,907
Carol:
<i>That one.</i>

385
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:24,089
Everything you're saying
is completely sane.

386
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,660
You're wanting to use a walker
for practice is a sane thing.

387
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:30,361
I mean it, okay.

388
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,732
I'm just-- I'm just trying
to wrap my mind around it.

389
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:36,835
Carol:
Lori's overdue.

390
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:38,737
She had Carl by C-section.

391
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:41,271
She's probably gonna have
to have this one the same way.

392
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:44,150
Hershel had a little bit of
experience with this kind of thing,

393
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:45,943
but he's not gonna
be able to do it anymore.

394
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:47,444
I need experience

395
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,847
and we have plenty of cadavers.

396
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,418
All right, well, like I
said, it's completely sane.

397
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:58,420
I need to learn
how to cut through

398
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,589
the abdomen and the uterus
without cutting the baby.

399
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,625
Why not?

400
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,663
I'll do it.

401
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:10,266
Okay.

402
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:25,981
Come on!
Hey, follow me. Come on.

403
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,616
Right here, come on.

404
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:31,118
<i>Follow me.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

405
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,887
<i>There we go.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

406
00:28:50,637 --> 00:28:53,039
You see the look on his face?

407
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,010
He makes one move,
just give me a signal.

408
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,006
- I ain't opening that.
- Yes, you are.

409
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:33,110
<i>If you want this cell block,</i>

410
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,078
you're gonna open that door.

411
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,249
Just the one, not both of them.

412
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,784
Because we need
to control this.

413
00:30:00,638 --> 00:30:02,772
You bitches ready?

414
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:10,178
I got this.

415
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:14,916
- I said one door!
- Shit happens.

416
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,342
T, mind the gap.

417
00:30:55,889 --> 00:31:00,259
- It was coming at me, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

418
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,961
I get it.

419
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,106
Shit happens.

420
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,606
No!

421
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,478
Ah!

422
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,523
Easy, now.

423
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,817
I got him.

424
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,356
Man, get down on your knees.

425
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,392
We don't have no affiliation
to what just happened.

426
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,894
Tell him, Oscar.

427
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,563
Stop talking, man.

428
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:03,919
( Door opens )

429
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:23,104
Let me back in, man.
Let me back in!

430
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:25,273
Open it up, man!
Open up!

431
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:27,609
- Open up.
- You'd better run.

432
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:33,714
<i>( Walkers munching )</i>

( Breathing stops )

437
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,066
What's happening?

438
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:36,339
Do something!

439
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,609
Somebody help!
Somebody!

440
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,144
Please help!

441
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,930
Come on.

442
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,367
<i>Come on.</i>

443
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:15,510
( Hershel gasps ) No!

444

( Snoring softly )

445
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:32,557
- We didn't have nothing to do with that.
- You didn't know?

446
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:34,960
You knew.
Daryl, let's end this now.

447
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,144
Sir, please, please,
listen to me!

448
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:38,965
It was them that was bad.
It wasn't us.

449
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,932
- Oh, that's convenient.
- You saw what he did to Tiny.

450
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,301
He was my friend.

451
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:47,471
Please, we ain't like that.

452
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:50,317
I like my pharmaceuticals,
but I'm no killer.

453
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:52,366
Oscar here, he's a B and E,

454
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:54,478
and he ain't very good
at it neither.

455
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:57,080
We ain't the violent kind,
they were!

456
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:01,351
Please, I swear to God!
I wanna live!

457
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,198
What about you?

458
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,168
I ain't never pleaded
for my life.

459
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:23,738
And I ain't about to start now.

460
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:25,874
So you do what you gotta do.

461
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:41,955
Oh, man.

462
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:51,664
Axel:
<i>I knew these guys.</i>

463
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:54,800
They were good men.

464
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:58,689
Let's go.

465
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,041
<i>So you're just gonna</i>
<i>leave us in here?</i>

466
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:04,910
- Man, this is sick.
- We're locking down this cell block.

467
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:07,513
From now on, this part
of the prison is yours.

468
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:10,449
Take it or leave it.
That was the deal.

469
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:14,453
You think this is sick?

470
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:16,154
You don't wanna know
what's outside.

471
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:20,558
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.

472
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:23,761
Sorry about your friends, man.

473
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:31,536
A word of advice--

474
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,541
take those bodies outside
and burn them.

Hershel stopped breathing.

- Mom saved him.
- It's true.

479
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,409
Still no fever.

480
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:15,799
Daddy?

481
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,435
Daddy.

485
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:20,525

We'll start cleaning tomorrow.

488
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:47,574
Yeah. It'll give
Carl a safe place to...

489
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,744
do whatever he does these days.

490
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:57,250
For the record, I-- I don't
think you're a bad mother.

Well, wife
is a different story.

492
00:41:07,128 --> 00:41:09,729
For better or worse, right?

493
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,665
I mean, what are
we gonna do-- hire lawyers

494
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,668
<i>and get divorced</i>
<i>and split our assets?</i>

495
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:24,810
We got food. Hershel's alive.
Today was a good day.

496
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:28,112
He'd be dead
if it weren't for you.

497
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,981
You're the one that acted fast.

498
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:33,084
If you hadn't done
what you did, then...

499
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:46,096
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.

500
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:53,636
Maybe there's nothing
to talk about anymore.

501
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:14,523
We're awful grateful
for what you did.
