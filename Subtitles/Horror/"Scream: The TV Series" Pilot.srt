Hey.

727
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:51,834
So, you never told me how it ends.

728
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:53,136
Uh... how what ends?

729
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:54,504
The town's horror story.

730
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,372
Does Tyler really kill Nina,

731
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:58,157
or is Brandon James back?

732
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,443
Um, well...

733
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:02,578
You know, you got to remember

734
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,282
that the whodunit may not be
as important in our story.

735
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:08,651
So, it's more of a "whydunit"?

736
00:40:08,652 --> 00:40:10,019
No.

737
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,288
I'm saying you need to forget
it's a horror story,

738
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:14,791
that someone might die at every turn.

739
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:18,528
You see, you have to care
if the smokin' hot lit teacher

740
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:21,597
seems a little too interested
in his female students.

741
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:25,134
You have to care if the team
wins the big game.

742
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:26,436
You, uh...

743
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:30,706
You have to care if the smart, pretty girl

744
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:33,076
forgives the dumb jock.

745
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:34,811
Sounds like "Friday Night Lights."

746
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,112
Exactly. You root for them.

747
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:37,381
You love them.

748
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:40,783
So when they are brutally murdered...

749
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:42,453
It hurts.

750
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,222
Emma: Hi.

751
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:49,058
What are you doing here?

752
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:51,027
I couldn't sleep last night.

753
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:52,328
Okay.

754
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:54,363
And what does that have to do with me?

755
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:57,200
It has to do with us.

756
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:59,569
What do you want from me,Em?

757
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,104
There's no "us" anymore.

758
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,839
Brooke may have let me into her party,

759
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,875
but I really don't think
we're going for mani-pedis anytime soon.

760
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:08,479
- I'm not Brooke.
- Give it time.

761
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:16,120
I was there.

762
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,989
At the parking lot.

763
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,291
You filmed me?

764
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,826
No. No, it wasn't me. It was Nina, okay?

765
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:26,295
We were just messing around,
and Nina saw you guys parked,

766
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:28,197
and I didn't even realize
it was you until...

767
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:29,632
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

768
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:34,204
So, this whole "let's be friends again"
thing is because you felt guilty?

769
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,709
You bitch.

770
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:48,985

Man: Hello, Emma.

774
00:41:57,628 --> 00:41:58,629
Who is this?

775
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,329
A friend.

776
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,331
Sorry, I'm not in the mood.

777
00:42:02,332 --> 00:42:03,733
Why are you crying?

778
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:04,968
What?

779
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:07,603
I hate to see you so sad.

780
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:10,273
Are you watching me?

781
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:13,443
It's what you want, right?
On Instagram and Facebook.

782
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:15,378
Perfect smiles, perfect lives.

783
00:42:15,379 --> 00:42:16,979
But I know the truth.

784
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,415
Who the hell is this?

785
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:22,652
I'm the one that's gonna lift the mask.

You know, I think about this stuff.

789
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,529
You really want to know how it ends?

790
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,500
Let me tell you.

791
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,421
Everyone has secrets.

792
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,562
Everyone tells lies.
