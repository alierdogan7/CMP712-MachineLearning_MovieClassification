1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,163
Another day to live through,
better get started.

2
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,311
Is that all it has been
since I inherited the world?

3
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,344
Only three years.

4
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:29,750
It seems like a hundred million.

5
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:37,669
Yeah, I own the world.
An empty, dead, silent world.

6
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,688
More of them for the pit.
Every day there are more of them.

7
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:55,859
They live off the weak ones
and leave them for the pit.

8
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:40,347
K-O-K-W calling. Come in.

9
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,105
K-O-K-W calling.

10
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,904
I'm on international frequency. Come in.

11
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:38,478
They can't bear to see their image.

12
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:40,616
It repels them.

13
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,090
I need more mirrors.

14
00:06:43,597 --> 00:06:46,122
And this garlic's lost its pungency.

15
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,544
There was a time
when eating was pleasurable.

16
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,489
Now it bores me. Just fuel for survival.

17
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:10,392
I'll settle for coffee and orange juice
this morning.

18
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,931
But first there is my life to consider.
I'd better replace that garlic.

19
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:33,221
I need more, lots more.
Better stop off and get them.

20
00:07:55,851 --> 00:08:00,015
I can't afford the luxury of anger.
Anger can make me vulnerable.

21
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:05,154
It can destroy my reason, and reason
is the only advantage I have over them.

22
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,831
Got to find where they hide during the day.

23
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,326
Uncover every one of them.

24
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:15,033
Now, where did I finish off yesterday?

25
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,142
Madison Street to 31st Avenue.

26
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,978
Eleven kills over three years.

27
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,778
And there's more than half the city
I haven't searched.

28
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,778
They are perfect.

29
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:55,449
Just wide enough to keep the flesh apart
so their body seal can't function.

30
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:58,292
How many more of these
will I have to make...

31
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,488
before they are all destroyed?

32
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:04,125
They want my blood. It's their lives or mine.

33
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,669
I still get squeamish.

34
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,716
Wait. That garlic.

35
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:21,053
I better put it back where it belongs.

36
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,115
I can't live a heartbeat away from hell
and forget it.

37
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:14,552
I'm out of gas.
That means one more stop I'll have to make.

38
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:39,142
I can get rid of them later.

39
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,545
Right now, I'm out of gas.

40
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,029
They're still fresh.

41
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:08,435
But I'll take only what I need.
They've got to last.

42
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:45,180
They can wait, too.
I've got my life to worry about.

43
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,243
Those mirrors have to be replaced
before dark.

44
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,794
Square blocks to search.
How many of them still exist?

45
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:26,766
How long will I have to keep up this search?

46
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,916
I haven't much time left.
It'll be dark in an hour.

47
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:30,949
And now 12 long hours
before the sun will rise...

48
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:34,149
and drive them back to darkness.

49
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,541
Morgan, come out.

50
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,912
Come out.

51
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,556
Robert, help me!

52
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,240
Another day.

53
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,913
Another day to start all over again.

54
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:20,933
Virge.

55
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,310
God, how I miss you.

56
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:03,521
The sun's already set.
They'll be everywhere!

57
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,533
It's Morgan. Get him.

58
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,487
Do you hear?

59
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:51,638
Do you hear, Morgan?

60
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,018
Three years.

61
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:07,804
Three years!

62
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:28,048
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

63
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,719
Virge?

64
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:34,694
Yes? No. My makeup. My hair!

65
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:39,964
- Where is everybody? All I can see is...
- Hi, Ben!

66
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:43,397
I can hear children,
but I can't see any children.

67
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:44,873
Uncle Ben!

68
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,643
Look at Uncle Ben!

69
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:01,418
- What did you bring me?
- Open them and see.

70
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,861
- Come.
- Are all those for Kathy?

71
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:19,980
Take a look at this.

72
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:34,392
- It's highly theoretical, Ben.
- Theoretical?

73
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,764
Do I have to remind you
that theory is the beginning of solution?

74
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,587
"Is Europe's disease
carried on the wind?" Is it, Ben?

75
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,282
- It could be.
- And if it is?

76
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,785
It isn't, Virge.

77
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,465
Is that what you really think,
or what you'd like to think?

78
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:03,368
I cannot accept half-baked theories
that sell newspapers.

79
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:06,339
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.

80
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,609
You're whistling past the graveyard.

81
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:11,511
Is that a commentary on my work at the lab?

82
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:14,551
- We both know how hard you've worked.
- I'm sorry.

83
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:18,555
I just can't accept the idea
of universal disease.

84
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:23,127
Uncle Ben, you promised us card tricks.

85
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:26,424
All right, Kathy. Who can resist that face?

86
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,933
All right. Card tricks.

87
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,568
Is it possible this germ, or virus,
could be airborne?

88
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,577
Anything is possible, Virge.

89
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:47,146
The best brains in the world
have been running through this thing...

90
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:48,852
with a fine-toothed comb.

91
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:51,054
The germ is visible under a microscope...

92
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,122
but it's not like any bacilli I've ever known.

93
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,700
In what way?

94
00:30:56,902 --> 00:31:00,862
It can't be destroyed by any process
we've been able to uncover.

95
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:05,606
But with the whole world trying,
there must be a solution.

96
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:09,312
Mommy, when are we gonna cut the cake?

97
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:13,887
Right now our problem is to cut that cake.

98
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:19,719
- Mommy.
- Coming.

99
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:46,833
The wind wake you up?

100
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,829
It always does.

101
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:50,834
How do you feel?

102
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:53,968
- I'm all right.
- Don't get up, honey.

103
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,516
- I'm not sick, I'll make your breakfast.
- You don't have to.

104
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,678
I'll be all right. Go on and read your paper.

105
00:33:00,754 --> 00:33:02,085
All right.

106
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:48,271
Sweetheart, look, if you don't feel well,
please go back to bed.

107
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:50,871
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

108
00:33:52,016 --> 00:33:54,577
I wish somebody would find a vaccine.

109
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,316
It's all we're working on at the lab.

110
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:02,485
Maybe you better not send her
to school today.

111
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,530
All right.

112
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:09,899
- Do you think you should go to work?
- I have to.

113
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,538
Bob, I'm so frightened.

114
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,275
Everything's going to be
all right, sweetheart.

115
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,888
- Well?
- The bacilli are multiplying.

116
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,563
That kicks the bone marrow theory
in the head.

117
00:34:58,631 --> 00:35:00,895
This specimen shows a higher white count...

118
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,300
than when I put it on the slide.

119
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:07,668
Those cells are still living, Dr. Mercer,
off one another.

120
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,711
There has to be an answer.

121
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,272
You've heard all communications
are ended outside the continental limits?

122
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,545
Yes, I heard.

123
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,556
That leaves it in our laps.
So we keep trying. Where's Cortman?

124
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:22,417
He should be here by now.

125
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:25,952
You two stay on this virus theory
until I decide it's exhausted.

126
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:27,191
Right.

127
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:31,168
- Yes, sir?
- Morgan will fill you in.

128
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:32,762
All right, sir.

129
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:38,735
And what did the great man of science
have to say today?

130
00:35:38,814 --> 00:35:42,307
- More of the usual?
- He's trying, Ben. Just like the rest of us.

131
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:44,046
And nothing works.

132
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:47,283
The streets are swarming
with truckloads of bodies...

133
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,122
that they're throwing
into that God-awful pit.

134
00:35:50,194 --> 00:35:52,060
And the dedicated Dr. Mercer goes on...

135
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,928
with his plodding, unimaginative approach.

136
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,663
- You have a better idea?
- Maybe.

137
00:35:58,037 --> 00:36:01,667
- At least it involves imagination.
- Ben, it's as simple as this.

138
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,837
An unknown germ
is being blown around the world.

139
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:08,449
It's highly contagious,
and it's reached plague proportions.

140
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:11,975
And you don't believe
some of the dead have come back?

141
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:13,750
Let's get to work.

142
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:19,861
And why are they burning the bodies?
Why don't they bury them?

143
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,832
Because it's the best known way
to control the contagion...

144
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:24,869
to keep the germ from spreading.

145
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,565
That's what we've always believed,
at any rate.

146
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,441
- You'd prefer us to believe in vampires?
- If they exist, yes.

147
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:34,845
There are stories being told, Bob.

148
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:37,976
By people who are out of their minds
with fear!

149
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:42,079
Maybe, but there are too many
to be just coincidental.

150
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,724
Stories about people who have died,
and have come back.

151
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:50,234
They're stories, Ben, stories.

152
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:54,204
And why are the infected people
always so tired in the daytime?

153
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,141
Why can't they stand the sunlight?

154
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:59,742
Why are they only seen at night?

155
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:02,946
Come here.

156
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,251
- Look.
- I know as well as...

157
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:14,862
- Now, is this bacilli or isn't it?
- It doesn't alter...

158
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:19,266
And this bacilli is found in the blood
of every infected person, or isn't it?

159
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,568
To show me germs
is not to refute these stories, Bob.

160
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,771
The point is, if there are vampires,
they exist in spite of these germs.

161
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,506
Come on, let's get to work.

162
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,954
Until further notice this station...

163
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:44,022
will continue its around-the-clock coverage
of this national disaster.

164
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,297
And now we switch you
to the state capitol...

165
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,165
where His Excellency, the Governor...

166
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:53,138
is speaking from the executive mansion.

167
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:58,213
Further, I have in conjunction
with the Federal Government...

168
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:01,184
declared this state to be a disaster area.

169
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:05,422
The public health is dependent on
the bodies of the deceased being burned.

170
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,018
You must notify
the Health Department immediately...

171
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:10,064
if you have a plague victim in your home.

172
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:12,692
Under no circumstances
should you gather publicly.

173
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,738
In view of the dire emergency that exists...

174
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,635
Anything new?

175
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,508
No, nothing new.

176
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,023
Nothing.

177
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:44,769
Mommy, where are you?

178
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,442
Mommy, I can't see.

179
00:38:52,383 --> 00:38:55,181
- I'm going to call the doctor.
- I said, no.

180
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:01,817
Virge, there's nothing they can do.

181
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:06,257
- But we can't just let her lie there.
- This way she has a chance.

182
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:10,501
If you call a doctor, he'll report it.
Do you want that?

183
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:17,904
Mommy, help me.

184
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:29,991
- How can you be so sure...
- Blindness is one of the symptoms.

185
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,564
You're not to call a doctor
under any circumstances.

186
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:38,203
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that.

187
00:39:43,145 --> 00:39:45,045
Mommy, where are you?

188
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:51,318
I've got to pick Ben Cortman up
on the way to the lab.

189
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,959
No one is to come into this house.

190
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,356
Now remember that!

191
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:16,046
No! Please!

192
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,489
Please don't let him be buried in the pit.

193
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:27,697
Please, for God's sake.
Don't take him away like this.

194
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:30,266
You can't!

195
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,345
- Who's there?
- It's me, Ben. We're late.

196
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,425
Ben, what's the matter with you?

197
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:21,557
Nothing. And I'm going to keep it that way.

198
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:25,467
- Look, let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

199
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:30,607
You think I'm out of my mind.
You laughed at me and my theory.

200
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:33,178
You might be one of them.

201
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:35,442
Look, you're ill. You ought to see a doctor.

202
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:36,915
No doctors.

203
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:40,582
You take care of your life.
I'll take care of mine.

204
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:42,555
Now get away from here.

205
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:45,526
You understand? Get away from here!

206
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:04,889
If you're looking for anybody but me,
forget it.

207
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,498
- Are they all gone?
- That's right.

208
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:17,805
Is there any hope from the latest reports?

209
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,005
No, not yet.

210
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:23,942
But believe me, Morgan,
we'll find an answer.

211
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:27,110
When, Doctor?
We need it right now. I need it!

212
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,782
You're the only one
who wasn't afraid to come here today.

213
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:34,582
What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer?

214
00:43:35,628 --> 00:43:39,963
Is everybody in the world going to die
before someone finds the answer?

215
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,866
No, I don't think so.

216
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:47,668
I don't deny that there's some
strange evolutionary process going on.

217
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:51,011
But mankind won't be destroyed.

218
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:54,713
The fact that you and I
are working here today...

219
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:57,416
is evidence of that.

220
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:18,576
All right. Let's roll.

221
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,583
When?

222
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,555
I called a doctor. I had to.

223
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:01,896
I told you not to call anyone.

224
00:45:02,235 --> 00:45:04,669
Bob, she was blind.

225
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:07,000
She couldn't see.

226
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:10,709
She kept reaching out her hands,
and groping for me.

227
00:45:12,047 --> 00:45:16,348
And all of a sudden she was gone.

228
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:20,616
And they came...

229
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:23,688
and I tried to stop them. They took her.

230
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:25,986
I saw a truck out there.

231
00:45:27,365 --> 00:45:29,834
Was that it? Was it?

232
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:31,161
Yes.

233
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,187
I'm sorry, lady. There's nothing I can do.

234
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:50,358
Let that truck through. Get out of the way.

235
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:53,328
Get back, folks. Nobody's allowed out there.

236
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:57,326
Please, all of you. Get behind those lines.

237
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:00,337
Look sharp there. Move. Move along.

238
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:06,204
Make way for that truck. This way.

239
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,980
Hey, you, mister! Come back!

240
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:26,398
Did this truck just come in
from Market Street?

241
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,269
I said, did this truck just come in
from Market Street?

242
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:31,172
Mister, I don't know.

243
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:49,425
Hey, you don't belong in here. Get out.

244
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:53,358
- I said get out!
- I want my daughter.

245
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,668
A lot of daughters are in there,
including my own.

246
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:36,585
Bob, I can't see!

247
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,589
I can't see!

248
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:31,681
No.

249
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:35,821
I won't let them put you there, Virge.

250
00:48:37,397 --> 00:48:38,763
I promise.

251
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,800
I won't let them put you there.

252
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,116
Let me in.

253
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,002
Who is it?

254
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,113
Who's there?

255
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,995
We're going to kill you, Morgan.

256
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:47,167
Do you hear?

257
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,777
Do you hear, Morgan?

258
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,655
If Cortman thinks he can get to me
by destroying my car...

259
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:04,753
his wits are getting dull.

260
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,569
This convertible would be nice.

261
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,540
Probably handles well.

262
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:17,340
But I can't think of comfort.

263
00:54:17,412 --> 00:54:20,245
There was a time when I shopped for a car.

264
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:23,047
Now I'm looking for a hearse.

265
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:26,079
This station wagon will have to do.

266
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:11,237
Alive.

267
00:55:12,146 --> 00:55:13,545
It's alive.

268
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,555
Wait. Don't run away!

269
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:23,716
Come back here.

270
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,753
Don't run away!

271
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:33,938
Come back. Come back here!

272
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:39,069
Wherever he is, I've got to find him.

273
00:55:39,145 --> 00:55:41,943
If I have to search every street,
every house, every alley...

274
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:44,849
every inch of this town, I've got to find him.

275
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,591
Come back!

276
00:55:55,998 --> 00:55:57,990
Hey, boy, where are you?

277
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:07,475
Where are you, pal? Come here.

278
00:56:41,788 --> 00:56:43,278
They're dead.

279
00:56:43,757 --> 00:56:45,520
They've been staked.

280
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,166
These are made of iron. Not wood, like mine.

281
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,614
Someone else is alive in this world.

282
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:08,883
But where are they? Where are they hiding?

283
00:57:14,962 --> 00:57:18,262
How many are there?
Where did they come from?

284
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,858
Why haven't I seen them?

285
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,745
This is Robert Morgan.

286
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:35,843
If somebody can hear me, answer me.

287
00:57:37,189 --> 00:57:39,248
For God's sake, answer me!

288
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:45,121
This is K-O-K-W calling.

289
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:49,134
Answer me.

290
00:58:23,846 --> 00:58:26,748
So you finally decided to come back.

291
00:58:29,854 --> 00:58:31,344
Good boy.

292
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:34,626
Oh, no.

293
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,192
Don't worry, boy.

294
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,870
You're going to be all right. Yes, you are.

295
00:58:57,921 --> 00:59:00,685
There now, we've got you all cleaned up.

296
00:59:02,326 --> 00:59:04,055
You're gonna feel better.

297
00:59:04,228 --> 00:59:07,665
Gonna put you down here now
and you can rest.

298
00:59:08,534 --> 00:59:10,799
Got you all cleaned up.

299
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:31,095
You know they're out there, don't you?

300
00:59:31,463 --> 00:59:34,024
You poor driven thing.

301
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,341
Everything's going to be all right.

302
00:59:43,111 --> 00:59:45,136
Nobody's going to hurt you.

303
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,715
Everything's going to be all right.

304
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,285
All right.

305
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,082
You're going to get better.

306
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:56,994
We're going to have
lots of happy times together.

307
00:59:58,296 --> 01:00:01,164
You'll see. Everything's going to be fine.

308
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:58,432
What's the use?

309
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:03,548
I'm not going to hurt you.
Can't you understand? Wait!

310
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,068
Wait.

311
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:29,672
I'm not going to hurt you. Wait.

312
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:35,084
I couldn't be out here in the daylight
if I was one of them.

313
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:38,249
You know that
they can't come out until sundown.

314
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,655
Do you want to come with me,
or do you want to face them?

315
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,068
- You feeling better?
- Yes.

316
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:20,079
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.

317
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:36,802
- You seem very well organized here.
- Yeah.

318
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:40,907
My name is Ruth Collins.

319
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:45,570
I was married.

320
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,445
I lost my husband.

321
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,980
You are alone?

322
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:58,728
- You were married?
- Yes.

323
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:01,328
Children?

324
01:05:03,102 --> 01:05:04,467
A daughter.

325
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,259
What are you doing?

326
01:05:31,737 --> 01:05:34,366
Please, stop! Stop it, please!

327
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,271
You're making me sick.

328
01:05:36,342 --> 01:05:39,335
Why do you turn away?

329
01:05:46,554 --> 01:05:49,718
- You are infected.
- No.

330
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,860
Infected systems are allergic to garlic.

331
01:05:56,968 --> 01:05:59,732
- You think I'm one of them.
- You will be.

332
01:06:02,341 --> 01:06:05,242
You've made up your mind just because I...

333
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,745
You can't change the facts by talking.

334
01:06:07,814 --> 01:06:10,249
Facts? What facts?

335
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,246
That I got sick?

336
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,812
I've had a sensitive stomach all my life.

337
01:06:15,891 --> 01:06:20,158
I saw my husband killed.
Torn to pieces, right in front of our house.

338
01:06:20,296 --> 01:06:22,594
I've been wandering ever since.

339
01:06:22,665 --> 01:06:25,601
Hiding at night.
Not eating more than scraps.

340
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:30,530
Sick with mourning, sick with fear,
unable to sleep.

341
01:06:32,143 --> 01:06:33,975
Then you shout at me.

342
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,614
You chase me across the field, hit me...

343
01:06:36,682 --> 01:06:39,208
drag me to this house, and to top it all...

344
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:43,087
when I get sick because you shove
a piece of reeking garlic in my face...

345
01:06:43,157 --> 01:06:45,182
you tell me I'm infected.

346
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:48,953
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

347
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:51,227
You can't go out there. It's almost sunset.

348
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:52,495
Let me go, I said.

349
01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:55,835
In a few minutes
the streets will be full of them.

350
01:06:56,006 --> 01:06:58,839
- I don't care.
- At least let me give you a blood test.

351
01:06:58,909 --> 01:07:00,468
Don't touch me.

352
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:19,901
You must be hungry.
I'll fix you some dinner.

353
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:42,060
- You know, you should eat.
- I can't.

354
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:01,350
- You seem used to them.
- As much as anybody could be.

355
01:08:02,053 --> 01:08:05,854
I'm not frightened of them anymore,
if that's what you mean.

356
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:09,953
I protect myself against them,
but only because there are so many.

357
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:12,358
Individually, they're weak.

358
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:15,891
Mentally incompetent,
like animals after a long famine.

359
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,632
If they weren't...

360
01:08:17,706 --> 01:08:21,803
they surely would've found a way
of breaking in here a long time ago.

361
01:08:21,878 --> 01:08:23,675
Come out, Morgan.

362
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,282
Hear that?

363
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:30,817
That's Ben Cortman.

364
01:08:31,523 --> 01:08:33,923
- He was my friend.
- Your friend?

365
01:08:34,092 --> 01:08:36,027
He was like a kid brother.

366
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:38,926
If I could find him and destroy him...

367
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,365
But you said he was your friend.

368
01:08:42,436 --> 01:08:46,498
When I find him I'll drive a stake
through him, just like all the others.

369
01:08:52,514 --> 01:08:56,383
But you lived through all this.
Do you know why?

370
01:08:57,888 --> 01:08:59,719
Perhaps I was chosen.

371
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,318
That's a laugh.

372
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:08,694
Or perhaps it's because a long time ago
when I worked in Panama...

373
01:09:08,768 --> 01:09:11,101
I was bitten in my sleep by a bat.

374
01:09:12,006 --> 01:09:13,564
My theory is...

375
01:09:14,308 --> 01:09:17,369
that the bat had previously
acquired the vampire germ.

376
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,174
By the time it entered my blood...

377
01:09:19,247 --> 01:09:21,944
it had been strained and weakened
by the bat's system.

378
01:09:22,018 --> 01:09:25,420
As a result, I have immunity.

379
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:30,019
It's only a guess, but it's all I have to go on.

380
01:09:33,532 --> 01:09:37,936
You don't think that I'm immune, do you?

381
01:09:38,538 --> 01:09:41,473
It's a simple matter to find out
whether you are or not.

382
01:09:49,117 --> 01:09:52,019
What will you do if I am infected?

383
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,184
Cure me?

384
01:09:56,794 --> 01:09:58,785
You don't have to answer.

385
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,990
I know as well as you do...

386
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:04,091
it's incurable.

387
01:10:04,169 --> 01:10:05,967
There might be a way.

388
01:10:06,205 --> 01:10:10,836
If not of killing the germ, at least
of containing it, keeping it from spreading.

389
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:14,676
If I had the equipment, the time.

390
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:17,610
Which you don't.

391
01:10:59,804 --> 01:11:01,635
You are one of them.

392
01:11:01,706 --> 01:11:05,473
I was. And without that injection,
I'll be one again.

393
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,972
What do you mean?

394
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:10,978
- You found a solution?
- That's right.

395
01:11:11,818 --> 01:11:13,810
Exactly as you said it could be.

396
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:16,685
I take that for it.

397
01:11:19,294 --> 01:11:20,386
What is it?

398
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:23,731
Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine.

399
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,959
The blood feeds the germ...

400
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:29,403
the vaccine keeps it isolated...

401
01:11:29,673 --> 01:11:32,108
and prevents it from multiplying.

402
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:36,712
We've had it for some time now.

403
01:11:37,383 --> 01:11:38,441
We?

404
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:42,552
There are quite a number of us.

405
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:46,155
And I thought you were alone.

406
01:11:46,827 --> 01:11:48,819
I was going to cure you.

407
01:11:49,731 --> 01:11:51,722
- Does that amuse you?
- No.

408
01:11:53,903 --> 01:11:56,531
Now, I want the truth.

409
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,866
I want all of it. Why are you here?

410
01:12:00,945 --> 01:12:03,608
To find out if you know any more
than we do.

411
01:12:03,682 --> 01:12:05,343
You know far less.

412
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,884
We're alive. Infected, yes. But alive.

413
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:11,957
We're going to reorganize society.

414
01:12:12,759 --> 01:12:17,026
Do away with those wretched creatures
who are neither alive nor dead.

415
01:12:17,498 --> 01:12:19,830
Start everything all over again.

416
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,233
And you want me to join?

417
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,869
You can't join us.

418
01:12:26,343 --> 01:12:28,334
You're a monster to them.

419
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,170
Why do you think I ran when I saw you?

420
01:12:31,382 --> 01:12:33,874
Even though I was assigned to spy on you.

421
01:12:33,952 --> 01:12:37,410
Because I was so terrified
of what I'd heard about you.

422
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:41,256
You're a legend in the city.
Living by day instead of night.

423
01:12:41,995 --> 01:12:45,625
Leaving, as evidence of your existence,
bloodless corpses.

424
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:48,931
Many of the people you destroyed
were still alive.

425
01:12:50,205 --> 01:12:53,334
Many of them were loved ones
of the people in my group.

426
01:12:55,344 --> 01:12:56,710
I didn't know.

427
01:12:56,913 --> 01:13:00,747
- Is there any way you can get out of here?
- What do you mean?

428
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:03,486
They're coming after you tonight.

429
01:13:03,788 --> 01:13:08,385
That's why I was sent here.
To prevent you from resisting them.

430
01:13:09,228 --> 01:13:14,166
I'm supposed to keep you here
until they come.

431
01:13:15,403 --> 01:13:18,031
- To kill me?
- Yes.

432
01:13:18,706 --> 01:13:21,141
Your new society sounds charming.

433
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:25,539
The beginning of any society
is never charming or gentle.

434
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:29,510
And you pretended to be shocked
at my violence.

435
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:32,780
What are you waiting for?

436
01:13:32,857 --> 01:13:37,318
Why don't you go on and use it?
Get it over with. Use it.

437
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,400
Now you know.

438
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:56,243
What are you going to do?

439
01:15:38,109 --> 01:15:41,307
- What are you doing?
- It's already done.

440
01:15:42,348 --> 01:15:43,441
What?

441
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:52,020
Look.

442
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,050
You see? It worked, Ruth.

443
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,813
The antibodies in my blood worked.

444
01:16:15,789 --> 01:16:18,019
My blood has saved you, Ruth.

445
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:22,592
Do you know what this means?
You and I can save all the others.

446
01:16:23,465 --> 01:16:26,492
We won't be alone.
We'll never be alone again.

447
01:16:28,004 --> 01:16:29,472
You are sure?

448
01:16:30,741 --> 01:16:31,867
Wait.

449
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,223
Don't be afraid.

450
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:19,160
Where are you going?

451
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:21,565
I have to tell them you're not a threat to us.

452
01:17:21,636 --> 01:17:23,696
- You can't go out there.
- You can save us all.

453
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:26,172
When they come,
there won't be time for explanations.

454
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:27,675
They'll come to kill.

455
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:31,180
For God's sake, Robert, let me go. Please.

456
01:17:31,348 --> 01:17:33,442
Ruth, look. Tomorrow.

457
01:17:34,352 --> 01:17:37,015
Please. Robert.

458
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:40,719
Tomorrow, Ruth. Tomorrow will be all right.

459
01:17:42,228 --> 01:17:43,957
Robert, no.

460
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,187
- Robert.
- Yes, Ruth?

461
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:10,624
- What if this doesn't last?
- But it will.

462
01:18:11,597 --> 01:18:14,499
I've already checked it
under the microscope.

463
01:18:14,567 --> 01:18:16,364
Wait, I'll show you.

464
01:18:17,304 --> 01:18:19,295
I'll prove it to you. I'll check it again.

465
01:18:41,267 --> 01:18:44,499
Ruth, just take a look at this.

466
01:18:46,206 --> 01:18:47,969
This'll prove it to you.

467
01:18:48,676 --> 01:18:50,735
There's no change. I've double-checked.

468
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:00,182
Get away from her.

469
01:19:01,558 --> 01:19:03,584
Ruth, are you all right?

470
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,773
Run, Robert!

471
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:24,913
Run! They've come to kill you, Robert.

472
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:40,604
Run!

473
01:20:02,599 --> 01:20:03,930
Up there!

474
01:20:21,455 --> 01:20:22,888
There he is.

475
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:27,557
Wait, you don't understand. Wait!

476
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:31,998
Get him!

477
01:20:42,982 --> 01:20:44,142
Wait!

478
01:20:49,623 --> 01:20:52,593
Surround the block. Move!

479
01:21:04,508 --> 01:21:06,476
This way. Hey, over here.

480
01:21:06,544 --> 01:21:08,604
This way. Cover all sides!

481
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:08,951
Stand back.

482
01:22:57,713 --> 01:23:00,181
There he is! In the church!

483
01:23:19,005 --> 01:23:20,564
Hold your fire!

484
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,519
Freaks!

485
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,826
All of you.

486
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:02,997
All of you, freaks. Mutations.

487
01:25:12,378 --> 01:25:13,538
Hold it.

488
01:25:13,612 --> 01:25:15,102
You're freaks.

489
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:17,382
I am a man.

490
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:20,979
The last man.

491
01:25:28,897 --> 01:25:30,832
They were afraid of me.

492
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:39,203
They didn't know.

493
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:21,292
Don't cry. There's nothing to cry about.

494
01:26:22,129 --> 01:26:23,858
We're all safe now.

495
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,297
All safe.

496
01:26:36,027 --> 01:26:43,618
THE END
