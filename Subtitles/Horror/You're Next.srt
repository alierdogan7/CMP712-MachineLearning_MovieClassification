Oh, hello.

Um, I was just wondering if you need
any help in here with anything.

183

I think I'm all set.

Actually... Erin?

Yeah?
I am out of milk.

Oh. Uh, okay.

187
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,420
Could you go over
to the neighbor's house

188
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,170
and see if he has some?
His name's Erik.

189
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,001
Okay.

190
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,509
Well, I'll be right back.

How's this look, Drake?

Beautiful. Great color.

Can you hold that?

Ready?

200
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,951
Beautiful.
Come join us, Erin.

201
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,537
Your mom just asked me
to go to your neighbor's

202
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,497
to see if I could borrow some milk.

Don't start with me.

Oh. Uh...

211
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,822

No?

00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,993
No. Uh...

214
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,205
I guess there were a lot of
applicants this year, and...

215
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,254
I haven't exactly been
published recently, so...

216
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,170
Well, there are some people
that aren't published

217
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,631
that do get the fellowship,
you know.

233
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:16,015
Hear what?
I heard footsteps.

234
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,636
I think someone's in the house.
Are you sure?

my dad got kind of paranoid.

was gonna run out of resources
in a matter of years.

01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:14,049

him, and we all moved to the Outback.
