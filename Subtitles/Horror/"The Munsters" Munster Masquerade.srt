1
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:07,317
Uh, Tom?

2
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:10,845
Before we say good night, wouldn't
you like to come in for a minute?
Mm-hmm!

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:13,051
And meet my folks.
Oh, you always
bring that up.

4
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,651
Why do I have to
meet your folks?

5
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:18,994
Well, I've been out with you
a lot, and my aunt and uncle
would like to meet you.

6
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:22,160
And your family.
Mm.
[Inhales Sharply]

7
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,068
They're sort of old-fashioned.
Well, I'll tell you what.

8
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:27,663
My parents are having that party
that you're coming to next week,

9
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,437
so why don't I get them
to invite your, uh...
[Door Banging]

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,206
Uh... Aah! Aah!
Oh!

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,874
It is your aunt and uncle,
isn't it? Yes.
Are you all right?

12
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,747
It is your aunt and uncle?
Yes, I've lived with them
since I was a baby.

13
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,687
Oh. Well, come here, baby.
Mm!
[Kissing Sound]

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,568
They're standing real close, Lily.

15
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:59,071
Uh, you know, this is the fourth date
she's had with that young man.

16
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:03,633
Oh, yes. It's amazing how some boys
will overlook a girl's appearance.

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,769
Sh-sh-sh-sh!
[Door Creaks, Closes]

18
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:08,713
Uh, have a good time, Marilyn?
Uh-huh.
And guess what?

19
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:12,343
Tom's parents are giving
a party next week, and I think
you're both going to be invited.

20
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:17,049
Well! I think it's high time we met
this young man's parents.

21
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:19,558
You can't be too careful these days.

22
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:22,390
There are a lot of strange people
in this world.

23
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:25,898
Hmm. A party.
Sounds wonderful.

24
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,696
You know, we don't get out at night
as much as we used to.

25
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:33,130
Well, I'm going up to bed.
[Kissing]

26
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,174
See you in the morning.
Good night, dear.

27
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,335
[Herman]
Good night.

28
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,404
[Gasps]
By the way, Tom says it's going
to be a masquerade party.

29
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:49,584
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to go, for Marilyn's sake.

30
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,056
But I wish it weren't
a masquerade.

31
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,059
I know what you mean.

32
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:58,621
If there's anything that disturbs me, Lily,
it's the idea of grown people like us...

33
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:01,690
dressing up in costume
and looking ridiculous.

34
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:15,567
Tom, dear, your father and I will be
happy to invite your little girlfriend
to the masquerade party,

35
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:19,100
but really now...
now, now the whole family.

36
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,272
I mean, just who are
the Munsters?

37
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,442
Mother, they are simply
her aunt and uncle.
[Scoffs]

38
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:28,113
And if they're anything like Marilyn,
I'm sure they're lovely, charming people.

39
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:31,783
All right, but I do so hope
the society columns...

40
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:34,918
won't misspell the Munsters'
name on the guest list.

41
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:39,091
I'd hate to have my friends
read that we'd entertained
a couple of Monsters.

42
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,566
Oh, Dad. Thanks very much
for putting in a word with Mom.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,438
[Sighs]
If we invite Marilyn's folks,
well...

44
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,500
[Chuckles]
It'll really help me out with her.

45
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:53,512
You know how it is.

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,413
Son, I haven't known how it is
for years.

47
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:01,847
If the Dalys are anything
like their handwriting,

48
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,288
they must fall over backwards a lot.

49
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,093
This party'll give us a chance
to look over the boy's parents.

50
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,790
We wouldn't want Marilyn marrying
into the wrong sort of family.

51
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:16,962
I've never heard of these Dalys,
and after all, we Munsters
are a very old family.

52
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:20,529
You're right, dear. It's not as if
someone just dug us up yesterday.

53
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,371
Look! They didn't invite me?

54
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,539
Why, I've never been so insulted
since the day I died.

55
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:32,608
Hmm. And besides,
as Marilyn's grandfather,
I should be there!

56
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,745
But, Grandpa, we don't even
know Mr. And Mrs. Daly.

57
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,880
We can't just take you along.

58
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:40,051
If I don't get to go,
I'll use my magic powers.

59
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll turn myself into chopped liver
and show up in the hors d'oeuvres.

60
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,193
Now, Grandpa,
will you calm down?
I won't! I won't!

61
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,634
I won't.! If I don't get to go,
I'll sit here and hold my breath...

62
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,638
till the color comes back
in my cheeks.

63
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,435
You're being a big, spoiled baby.

64
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:57,340
Well, I suppose I could
ask the Dalys to invite him.

65
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,607
It's better than having him
come as chopped liver.
Thank you.

66
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:05,741
Of course, Mrs. Munster.
Mr. Daly and I will be happy...

67
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,549
to have dear Grandpapa.

68
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,455
Not at all, Mrs. Munster.
You're quite welcome.

69
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:16,587
[Hangs Up Receiver]
Albert, I'm afraid those Munsters
are frightful pushers.

70
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:21,100
Mrs. Munster just wheedled
an invitation for some old grandpapa
they've got kicking around the house.

71
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,658
- You couldn't put her off?
- How could I?

72
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:27,730
She gave me this sob story.
Said when someone's been living
with you for hundreds of years,

73
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,105
he's just like
one of the family.

74
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,605
Now what on earth could
she have meant by that?

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,910
You must have
misunderstood her, dear.

76
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:40,214
The way things are going, the only
worse thing that could happen would be
if it rained on the night of our party.

77
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,815
[Thunderclap]

78
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,824
Boy, look at the neat lightning.
I sure hope it hits our house.

79
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,297
Eddie, how do you like me
as Priscilla?

80
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:57,769
Corny. Why don't you dress up
as a lady gorilla or something
pretty like that?

81
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,169
I don't think
even that would help me.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,199
If you're going to a masquerade party,
who am I gonna have for a babysitter?

83
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:07,212
Mrs. Morton, the mother
of one of my girlfriends.

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,748
She's a very nice lady
who just loves little boys.

85
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,717
Yuck.
[Clanking]

86
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,118
Hey, Dad!

87
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,553
Uncle Herman, you make
a simply wonderful King Arthur.

88
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:24,188
Daddy? Are you in there?

89
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:27,028
Hello, "dere."
[Chuckles]

90
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,125
[Chuckles]
What's Aunt Lily coming as?

91
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,363
Uh, she hasn't let me
see her costume.

92
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:33,838
She's being coy.
[Lily]
Yoo-hoo.

93
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:36,375
- Lily?
- Guess who?

94
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:40,402
- Who?
- Little Bo Peep.

95
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:46,685
[Muffled]
Lily! Uh, uh, you scared me
out of a century's growth.

96
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:50,416
- How do I look?
- Positively awful.

97
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,153
Thank you. [Chuckles]
It's amazing what
they can do with makeup.

98
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:59,665
Eddie, don't forget
to give Spotty his supper,
and then go on up to bed.

99
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,201
Oh, and don't forget
to wash behind your points.

100
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:04,202
Okay, if I have to.
Good night, everybody.

101
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,204
Good night.
Good night, Eddie.
Good night, Eddie.

102
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:11,676
[Squawking]
At the sound of the tone,
the time is 8:09.

103
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,908
Nevermore. [Squawks]
Nevermore.
Why don't you pipe down?

104
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,108
[Muffled]
Pipe down!

105
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,777
[Door Banging]
That must be Tom.

106
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,316
[Wind Howling]
Hello, Priscilla.

107
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,758
Hi, John Alden.
Where's your raincoat?

108
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:31,797
Why, it's the most beautiful weather
all over town. It's only raining in this block.

109
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:35,266
Crazy!
Tom, I want you to come in
and meet my aunt and uncle.

110
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,499
Tom, this is my Aunt Lily.
How do you do?

111
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:44,202
How do you do?
[Chuckles] It's a...
It's a great pleasure.

112
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:50,608
This is, uh...
It's uh, uh, uh, quite a house
you have here.

113
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:53,950
Why, there's a fine old relic.

114
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,319
- [Clanks]
- Tom, my uncle's in there!

115
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:02,921
Oh, the masquerade!
I'm... I'm terribly sorry, sir.

116
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,260
L...
Gadzooks, that smarts.

117
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,734
Well, we'll see you all
at the masquerade.

118
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,170
You're going to love my parents.
They're a... They're a gas.

119
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,367
We're certainly looking forward
to meeting your parents, Thomas.

120
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,741
Now, you children have fun.
Oh, don't worry about us.

121
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,838
I'm... I'm terribly sorry, sir.

122
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,543
Oh, uh, quite all right.
Quite all right.

123
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,543
Nice to have
bumped into you.

124
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:45,628
Grandpa?
Hurry it up!
[Banging]

125
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:51,473
[Bottles Rattling]
I'll be there in a minute!
I'm still working on my costume!

126
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,442
Let me see. Jack the Ripper,
Fairy Godmother,

127
00:08:56,516 --> 00:09:00,646
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde...
Mr. Hyde!

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,451
[Laughing]
Mr. Hyde! Ooh, that's quick,
sure-fire,

129
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:08,221
and got Frederic March
his first Academy Award.

130
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,163
?? [Humming]

131
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,741
?? [Continues Humming]

132
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:30,205
[Bubbling]
Cheers.

133
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,679
[Gulping]

134
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,212
Ahh!
[Sighing]

135
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,593
Well, come on already.
You know, I don't have all day!

136
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:46,894
[Winces, Screams]

137
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:51,499
[Continues Screaming]

138
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,407
Nothin'!

139
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,080
It's still me.

140
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:10,486
Oh, boy!

141
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,957
Somebody up there's been
cuttin' this stuff again.

142
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,757
Herman? No matter what
these Dalys are like tonight,

143
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:26,999
I want you to remember
to be gracious and polite.

144
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,873
Don't worry, dear. In spite
of this silly costume,

145
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:34,345
I'll be my own
charming, natural self.

146
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,712
I'm every inch a gentleman.

147
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,774
In fact, several gentlemen.

148
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,785
[Both Laughing]

149
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:42,787
[Armor Squeaking]
[Sighing]

150
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,323
Ooh. Ooh!
[Laughs]

151
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,518
You feel so nice and cold.

152
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:53,189
Albert, the guests will be
arriving soon. Are you ready?

153
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:57,600
[Albert]Just a second, dear.
And, Albert, for Tom's sake, no matter
what you think of those Munster people,

154
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,867
I don't want you doing or saying
anything to offend them.

155
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,306
You know me better than that, dear.

156
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:16,812
Our little boy, Eddie, is playing
in his room, Mrs. Morton.

157
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,948
I'm sure he won't
give you any trouble.

158
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:22,620
Of course he won't.
I've been a babysitter
for 20 years,

that can... faze me.

Why, Grandpa. You really
look like Napoleon.

161
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,873
Oh, it was easy. I just combined
the bottles marked...

162
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,511

and Marlon Brando.

163
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:58,663
Come on, Lily.
We'd better get going.

164
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:03,191
Oh, Mrs. Morton.
This is my husband, Mr. Munster.

165
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,567
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?

166
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, yes, and this is
my father, the Count.

167
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,440
My pleasure!

168

it's stopped raining.

Well, let's try not to let it
spoil our evening!

171

Well, good night, Mrs. Morton.
Make yourself at home.

172
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:40,331
Oh! And if Eddie's pet, Spotty, comes
scratching at the back door,
don't let him in.

173

Now, Grandpa, I want you
to behave yourself tonight.

177
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,849
Don't get silly after two drinks and start
telling those shaggy wolf stories of yours.

We want to make a good impression,

Oh, don't worry. You can count
on me to be in a very dignified vein.

We're the Munsters.

Yes, Eddie. What is it?
Request permission
to skip bath tonight. Over.

would you want to do that, Eddie?

inviting those horrible people!

don't give that grandfather of theirs
anything more to drink!

of someone I know.

Yes. Uh, hello, Thomas.

323
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,846
We just got out of
our masquerade costumes,
and we're relaxing.

324
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:01,249
You mean, you...

325
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,379
He...

326
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:05,480
She...

327
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,091
Oh, no!
[Whimpering]

328
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,831
Uncle Herman, what happened?
Why is Tom running?

329
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:23,273
I don't know. It-It was extremely rude
of him not even to say good-bye.

330
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:27,779
I'm not surprised.
With a family like that, how
could he have any manners?

331
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:32,613
Well, looks like I scared
another one away.

332
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,982
But for once, I'm kind of glad.

333
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:40,317
I must say, there was something
strange about that boy.

334
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,088
He had the weirdest hairdo
I've ever seen.
