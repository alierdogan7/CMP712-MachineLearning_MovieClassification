- I suspect she did.

that she was very difficult to wake up.

285

a kind of abnormal deep sleep...

You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.

347
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:35,730
He's just trying to be
a good, protective father.

348
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:40,193
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

349
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:43,487
He's just doing
what a good father should do.

350
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,948
He's protecting his little girl.
Now, there's...

351
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,950
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?

352
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,869
He doesn't want to see her hurt.

353
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:53,039
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody,
not even her own mother.

354
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:55,124
Now, is there anything wrong with that?

355
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,835
Is there?

356
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,462
No.

357
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:03,382
No, there isn't.

358
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:05,593
[Kisses]

359
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:09,597
After all, that's just
what I did for you, isn't it?

360
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,058
Hmm?

361
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:15,978
Frank's protecting Candy
the same way as I protected you, isn't he?

362
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:19,857
Well, isn't he?

363
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,484
No.

364
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,947
No? What do you mean no?

365
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:30,076
- What do you mean when you say no?
- I love you, Daddy.

366
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,912
What do you mean when you say no?

367
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,414
I don't want you to think
that I don't love you.

368
00:28:35,498 --> 00:28:37,416
What do you mean when you say no?

369
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,001
I mean you didn't.

370
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:42,797
Didn't?

371
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,507
Didn't what?

372
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,887
You didn't protect me.

373
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:51,764
You didn't.

374
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,599
You didn't. You didn't. You didn't.

375
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:55,935
And you should have.

376
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:00,356
You should have.

377
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:05,569
You shouldn't have
looked away when she hit me.

378
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:13,786
And you shouldn't have walked away
from the table when she twisted my words.

379
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,871
You should have stopped her.

380
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,046
You should have hit her when she hit me!

381
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,757
You should have slapped her
when she slapped me!

382
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:29,593
Oh, God, I love you.

383
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,850
But you didn't protect me...

384
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:37,893
and you should have.

385
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:40,479
You pretended it wasn't happening.

386
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:42,481
You looked away.

387
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,235
And you should have.

388
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:49,405
Why didn't you?

389
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:53,034
Why didn't you?

390
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,537
Didn't you love me?

391
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,759
[Whirring]

392
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:40,873
- Look, there he is.
- <i>[Woman On PA, Indistinct]</i>

393
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,501
There's Grandpa Barton.

394
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,127
Barton.

395
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,797
Oh, hello, Frank. How you doing?

396
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,382
- Good to see you.
- Let me take that.

397
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:51,717
Hello. How you doing, Candy?

398
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:54,595
I guess you don't remember
your old granddad, eh?

399
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:57,890
Right this way.

400
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:01,060
You didn't have to come way out here, Frank.
We could have met later at the hotel.

401
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:03,896
I just didn't like the idea
of you coming in alone.

402
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,940
How long are you planning to stay in town?

403
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:08,776
Well, I guess we could have
the funeral tomorrow, but, uh...

404
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,861
Juliana's parents might want
to come in from Arizona.

405
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:13,072
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.

406
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,199
I don't know just how
it's going to work out.

407
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:18,369
- What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.

408
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:22,957
You know, I was even thinking about
going out to that old house again.

409
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,502
[Chuckles]
I still have the key after all these years.

410
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:30,756
Juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks.

411
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,967
I could never understand why.

412
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,387
Maybe it's because she really couldn't
admit that we <i>were</i> finished.

413
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:39,849
Ah, Frank, when I think
about you and Nola...

414
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,101
and this sweet child...

415
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:44,645
having to go through the same heartaches
we went through, it's...

416
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:47,440
it's enough to make you cry.

417
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:50,693
Yes, it is.

418
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:32,193
Uh, I'm here to see Mr. Hartog.

419
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:33,777
Mr. Jan Hartog.

00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,433
Sit down. Yeah. I'll be right there.

423
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,981
Sit down. I'll be with you in a second.

424
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,945
Goddamn son of a bitch.

425
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,532
I don't know. I don't know.

426
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:22,993
You know, I just don't know.

- [Alarm Ringing]
- Okay.

00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:28,165

[Exhales Sharply]

431
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,304
That's my, uh...

432
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,057
my heart over there on the floor.

433
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,143
- Your heart?
- My second heart.

434
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:52,273
I mean, your first heart makes your...
makes your blood circulate, right?

435
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:56,277
But what about your, uh, lymphatic fluids?

436
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,195
Well, I don't know.

437
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,408
Well, movement... walking, running, fucking,
rolling on the floor, anything.

438
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:07,413
I mean, people have this whole other
system they don't even know about.

439
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:08,998
The lymphatic system.

440
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:14,503
It's just like the blood system with
its own style of-of veins and arteries...

441
00:34:14,587 --> 00:34:16,839
but... but no heart.

442
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:21,302
You have to keep moving.
You have to circulate.

443
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:24,096
And, uh, they've just given me pills.

444
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,807
They do that every day!

445
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,101
[Chuckles]
And, uh... And I've gotta...

446
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:32,187
I've gotta move 'em
through the lymphatic system.

447
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:36,525
Goddamn it.

448
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,695
[Sighs Loudly]

449
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,782
Pardon my sweat.

450
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,909
I'm gonna take a bath real soon.

451
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:51,957
So, uh, Mr.... um, uh, Carveth...

452
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,001
how did you get my name?

453
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:56,086
My lawyer knows your lawyer.

454
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,173
Oh, I see. I get it.
And is your... is your lawyer...

455
00:34:59,256 --> 00:35:02,301
preparing a case against Raglan too?

456
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:03,927
Basically, yes.

457
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:06,305
Uh, slightly different from yours.

458
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:08,515
Yeah? How different?

459
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,977
Well, my wife is still
in therapy with Raglan.

460
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:17,483
Uh, I'm claiming psychological damage,
uh, not physiological.

461
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:21,111
Oh, I see. Well, give him
some more time with your wife...

462
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:24,239
and you'll be able to claim
physiological damage too.

463
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,410
Won't this look impressive in court?

464
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,622
- [Groans]
- Hmm?

465
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:34,458
You like it? I do.

466
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:38,837
That's Raglan. That's Psychoplasmics.

467
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:42,174
[Chuckles]
It's called lymphosarcoma.

468
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,385
[Singsongy]
And it's spreading.

469
00:35:45,469 --> 00:35:48,722
It's a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system.

470
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:50,808
You blame Raglan for that?

471
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,228
Oh, Raglan did it.

472
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:58,440
I mean, Raglan encouraged my body to-to...

473
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:02,403
to revolt against me, you know.

474
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:04,238
And it did.

475
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:08,534
Now I have a small
revolution on my hands...

476
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:11,620
and I'm not putting it down
very successfully.

477
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:15,541
Then your lawyer really thinks he can
prove Raglan's responsible?

478
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:17,084
Are you kidding me?

479
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,336
You can't prove a thing like...
like that in court.

480
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,548
Right from square one, you're into...
you're into, what, metaphysics.

481
00:36:22,631 --> 00:36:24,258
Mmm.

482
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:28,345
I mean, how do you know
I'm not gonna get cancer at age 32...

483
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:32,307
whether I'd gone into
Psychoplasmics therapy or not?

484
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:36,395
No, no, no.
We'd get laughed out of court.

485
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:39,022
Well, then why are you going into court?

486
00:36:39,982 --> 00:36:42,860
[Whispers]
Revenge.

487
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:45,028
Yeah, revenge.

488
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,783
Even if we lose, people'll get nervous
about Psychoplasmics.

489
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:52,745
It will be bad publicity.

490
00:36:52,828 --> 00:36:54,204
You know?

491
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:57,207
They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

492
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,752
They'll just remember the slogan...

493
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:03,797
"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."

494
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:05,883
Catchy, huh?

495
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,345
Is that gonna help?

496
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:15,601
Maybe.

497
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,478
I'm not alone, you know.

498
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:21,565
I mean, I'm in touch with a lot of people
who did Psychoplasmics.

499
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:24,860
We might form a club.

500
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:30,699
I... I... I want to help you.

501
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:34,620
Okay. Thanks.

502
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:56,141
Dr. Raglan?

503
00:37:58,685 --> 00:37:59,978
Yes.

504
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:03,398
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.

505
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:05,692
I'm glad to meet you.

506
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:08,570
I'm sorry to, uh, accost you like this...

507
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,573
but, uh, your receptionist
wasn't too helpful.

508
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:14,034
Yes, well, she probably knew
I was on my way to...

509
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:17,142
Did you know that Nola's
mother died yesterday,

510
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,705
that she was murdered?

511
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,708
Yes. The police spoke to me.

512
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:24,878
- Then you've told her?
- No, I haven't.

513
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:28,757
Well, then,
that's why I'm here... to tell her.

514
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:33,345
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

515
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,556
That's why Nola must not be told.

516
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,350
What?

517
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,895
Nola is going through

is completely assimilated...

Candy?

871

- Hmm?

Hal, where's... Where is Chris?

875
01:07:34,459 --> 01:07:36,545
Chris usually wakes me up.

876
01:07:36,628 --> 01:07:39,548
Chris had to go into the city.

877
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:41,508
- Mmm.
- You've been dreaming.

878
01:07:43,302 --> 01:07:45,929
Yes, I was having a wonderful dream.

01:07:46,013 --> 01:07:47,514
Wonderful.

I don't remember.

886
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:12,372
Then maybe we should talk about her.

887
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,501
But I don't feel the need
to talk about her.

888

You don't? Why not?

I don't know, Hal.

890
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,973
I think I must be
getting stronger because...

891
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:34,561
somehow, I just don't feel
threatened by her anymore.

It's not a coincidence.

If they brought her back here, then she'd...

941
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:47,142
then she'd be up there in the attic.

Because in a sense, she's one of them.

You're insane.

949
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,591
Frank, they exist. You've seen them.

being their surrogate mother.

She's not their surrogate mother, Frank.

954
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:36,274
She's their real mother.

955
01:15:37,484 --> 01:15:39,069

Raglan, I'm not gonna listen.

957
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:45,116
They're her children, Frank.

958
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,161
More exactly,
they're the children of her rage.

959
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,163
They're motivated only by her anger...

960
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:54,000
whether that anger
is conscious or subconscious.

961
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:58,213
I mean, when... When Nola got cross
with Candy last weekend...

962
01:15:58,296 --> 01:16:00,256
annoyed really...

963
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,383
the brood beat her.

964
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:06,221
But when she released her rage
against her parents under therapy...

965
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:09,015
then they killed them.

966
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,061
Now, I didn't want to believe that.

967
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,063
But now they've killed Ruth Mayer.

968
01:16:15,146 --> 01:16:18,733
And they could kill you or me,
and she wouldn't even be aware of it.

969
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,320
I mean, she doesn't even
know that Candy's here.

970
01:16:25,865 --> 01:16:27,700
I want Candice back.

971
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:29,786
Then do it my way.

972
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:33,373
Please. It's the right way.

973
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,502
What do you want me to do?

974
01:16:38,503 --> 01:16:40,964
I want you to go back into that hut...

975
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:44,134
and persuade Nola
that you want her back...

976
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:46,636
that you want your family back.

977
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,598
I want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband.

978
01:16:50,682 --> 01:16:51,808
Why?

979
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:55,019
Because if you can
keep Nola calm and happy...

980
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:57,522
then the brood's neutral.

981
01:16:57,605 --> 01:16:59,649
If she's mellow...

982
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:02,152
then I can just walk into that attic...

983
01:17:02,235 --> 01:17:04,946
pick up Candy,
tuck her under my arm and walk out.

984
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:07,574
Now, can you do that?

985
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:12,078
I don't know.

986
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,915
Frank, if things go wrong...

987
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:19,127
if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry...

988
01:17:21,379 --> 01:17:23,548
You understand?

989
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:26,718
I'm not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger.

990
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:29,095
Raglan, I don't trust you.

991
01:17:32,265 --> 01:17:33,975

992
01:17:35,143 --> 01:17:38,146

30 seconds after you're in.

997

Am I dreaming?

998
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:44,504
I thought you said you weren't going
to come and see me while I was here.

999
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,343
Well, I think that was a misunderstanding.

1000
01:18:55,223 --> 01:18:57,225
That's why I'm here.

1001
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:01,354

1005

I want you to know that.

1006
01:19:55,575 --> 01:19:59,620
I wish it were true.
God, I wish it were true.

1007
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:30,860
We've lost touch.

1008
01:20:32,278 --> 01:20:35,782
That's the only reason
all this ever happened.

1009
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:39,952
All we have to do is make sure
we don't lose touch again.

1010
01:20:41,287 --> 01:20:44,290
Isolation is part of my therapy, Frank.

1011
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:50,046
What's been happening to me
has been just too strange...

1012
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:55,093
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life.

1013
01:20:56,302 --> 01:20:59,639
