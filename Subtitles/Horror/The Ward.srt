I know it hasn't been pleasant,

735
01:19:22,349 --> 01:19:25,386
but my techniques are helping you.

736
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,600
After several years of therapy,

737
01:19:27,604 --> 01:19:30,471
we've been able to isolate
your different identities.

738
01:19:30,482 --> 01:19:32,347
We'd just begun to single them out

739
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:36,648
and eliminate them through
some experimental techniques

740
01:19:36,655 --> 01:19:38,395
when you, Kristen, appeared.

741
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,410
I didn't just appear!

742
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,029
Your psyche invented Kristen

743
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,373
to protect itself
from having to relive this trauma.

744

[TICK-TICK TICK-TICK]

745
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:12,055
And now it's time to say goodbye.

746
01:20:22,743 --> 01:20:24,279
Please don't kill me.

[ROARING]

748
01:20:40,552 --> 01:20:42,543
Don't move. Don't move.

749
01:20:48,769 --> 01:20:50,885
She's the last one who got out.

750
01:20:52,064 --> 01:20:53,429
What did you say?

751
01:20:54,441 --> 01:20:58,525
DR. STRINGER: Iris, you know we don't
discuss people who aren't present.

752
01:20:59,571 --> 01:21:01,311
She can't remember the rules.

753
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:04,280
Because she's the crazy one
around here, you know.

754
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,945
MAN: That's enough.

755
01:21:14,378 --> 01:21:15,663
Is she cured?

756
01:21:17,047 --> 01:21:19,629
She'll probably need a lifetime of therapy,

757
01:21:19,633 --> 01:21:21,999
but she's no longer a danger to herself.

758
01:21:22,886 --> 01:21:27,971
She is, essentially, your daughter again.

759
01:21:29,142 --> 01:21:30,473
Can we please see her now?

760
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:35,936
MOTHER: Alice?

761
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,525
Honey, you okay?

762
01:21:47,244 --> 01:21:48,950
We love you, sweetheart.

763
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:54,038
Mom? Dad?

764
01:21:54,918 --> 01:21:56,158
Oh, honey.

765
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:10,055
I figured you'd want your things around you.

766
01:22:16,815 --> 01:22:19,022
And I put this one back together
for you, too.

767
01:22:23,113 --> 01:22:24,102
Thank you.

768
01:22:40,213 --> 01:22:41,498
I think I remember.

769
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:43,497
What do you remember?

770
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,458
Everything.

771
01:22:48,513 --> 01:22:50,049
The old farmhouse.

772
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,259
This place.

773
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:53,723
The others.

774
01:22:54,895 --> 01:22:57,386
Emily. Sarah. Iris.

775
01:22:58,690 --> 01:22:59,930
Kristen.

776
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,065
You can forget all about them now.

777
01:23:05,071 --> 01:23:06,527
When can I get out of here?

778
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:08,522
I really... I just want to go home.

779
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:12,651
Dr. Stringer says two, maybe three days.

780
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:15,616
I think that's enough visiting for today.

781
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,660
We'll let you get some rest.

782
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:19,532
Couldn't we stay just a little bit longer?

783
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:21,830
You'll have her all to yourself in no time.
