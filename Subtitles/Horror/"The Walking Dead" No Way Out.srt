00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:03,422
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead....

2
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:06,226
Everyone! Get into your houses!
Go!

3
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:07,903
<i>(Glenn) My friend's
are in there.</i>

4
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:09,664
<i>My pregnant wife.</i>

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,750
No!

6
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:11,834
Argh!

7
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,300
Ugh!
No!

8
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,206
<i>(Tara) You're not gonna
make it out there.</i>

9
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,708
<i>(Wolf)
We'll see.</i>

10
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,153
<i>(Rick) We're gonna
gut these things.</i>

11
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:22,970
<i>It'll mask our smell.</i>

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,429
<i>Make 'em think we're like them.</i>

13
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:27,103
<i>Stay calm.
Don't draw attention.</i>

14
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:28,971
<i>We can move right through 'em.</i>

15
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,756
Why don't you come on out,
join us in the road?

16
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:54,945
That's great.

17
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:57,094
It's going well
right out of the gate.

18
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:59,630
Now, step two,
hand over your weapons.

19
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:03,200
- Why should we?
- Well, they're not yours.

20
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:05,302
Whose are they?

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,285
Your property
now belongs to Negan.

22
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,629
And if you can get your
hands on a tanker,

23
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,232
you're people our person
wants to know.

24
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,236
So let's get those
sidearms, shall we?

25
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:32,639
Right now.

26
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,564
Thank you.

27
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,487
Thank you.

28
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:56,963
If you have to eat shit,

29
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:59,299
best not to nibble.

30
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,169
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

31
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,970
It goes quicker.

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,683
( mouths )
Thank you.

33
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,655
Who are you people?

34
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:24,357
I get the curiosity,

35
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,560
but we have questions ourselves.

36
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,864
And we'll be
the ones asking them

37
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,868
while we drive you back to
wherever it is you call home.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,771
Take a gander at where
you hang your hats.

39
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,375
First, though, your shit.

40
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,910
<i>What have you got for us?</i>

41
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:45,412
Yeah, you just took it.

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,517
Come on.

43
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,886
I mean, can we not, okay?

44
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:54,988
<i>There's more.</i>

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,524
<i>There is always more.</i>

46
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,695
( sighs )

47
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,431
T...

48
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,234
take my man to the back
of the truck,

49
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,202
start inside the back bumper,

50
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,671
<i>work your way to the front.</i>

51
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:12,839
Go.

52
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:20,213
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

53
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:21,748
Who's Negan?

54
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,251
♪ Ding, dong ♪

55
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,253
♪ Hell's bells. ♪

56
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,125
You see, usually
we introduce ourselves

57
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,561
by just popping one of you
right off the bat.

58
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,530
But you seem like
reasonable people.

59
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:40,500
I mean, you're sportin' dress
blues, for Christ's sake.

60
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,903
And, like I said, we're gonna
drive you back to where you were.

61
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,905
I mean, do you know
how awkward it is

62
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,774
carpooling with someone whose friend
or friends you've just killed?

63
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,943
Oof.

64
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:54,114
But I told you
not to ask any questions.

65
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,216
And then what does
this ginger do?

66
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,203
So that's that.

67
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,455
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me.

68
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,207
- ( hammer clicks )
- Wait.

69
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,563
Wait.

70
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,933
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

71
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,103
Shut up.

72
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:20,273
I am talking to the man.

73
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,943
No, you're not.

74
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,379
<i>( hammer clicks )</i>

75
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:33,486
( sighs )

76
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,822
I'm not gonna kill you.

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,244
( sighs )

78
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:44,331
Wait, wait.

79
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,301
You know what?

80
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,569
Yes, I am.

81
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,955

( groans, coughs )

84
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,833
Son of a bitch
was tougher than he looked.

85
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,371
- Sasha: Did he cut you?
- A little.

86
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,409
What a bunch of assholes.

87
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,845
Let's get you fixed up at home.

88
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,546
Yes, ma'am.

89
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,987
( spits )

90
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,391
Nibble on that.

All right, new plan.

Flares from a few guns

<i>Too many walkers,

We're not going to the armory.

97

We need our vehicles
back at the quarry.

98
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,317
All of us drive.
We'll need to round 'em up.

to the quarry and back, I...

103
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,705
I'll take her.

104
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,257
Keep her safe in my church

the walkers away.

Can you do this?

107
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,967
I'm supposed to.

108
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,335
I have to.

109
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,139
I will.

110
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,842

- Take Sam.
- No.

115
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,659
Yes, Sam, it'll be safer.

116
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,993
I'm not leaving you.

117
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,297
- Sam--
- Mom, I'm not.

00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,998

Okay.

124
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,441

Shh, shh, shh...

00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:40,388
Hey.

128
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,390
He's gonna make it.

129
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,958
Okay?

130
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,145
I know it.

131
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,367
Sam.

132
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:13,755
( growling )

133
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,601
We have to try.

134
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,102
We cannot go out there.
There are too many of them.

135
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,437
<i>Rosita, he's gonna kill her.</i>

136
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,772
We won't get to her.

137
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,073
She needs us.

138
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,574
We'll die.

139
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:34,776
That is what will happen.

140
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,327
We have one gun,

141
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,497
and the streets are filled
with those things.

142
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,449
That man needs her.

143
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,118
Okay?
She's a doctor. He is sick.

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,337
And I think we've seen
that he knows how to survive.

145
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,424
But we need to make sure
that Carol and Morgan are okay

146
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:50,925
and then we make a plan.

147
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,427
We cannot just go.

148
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:55,296
Okay.

149
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,931

<i>Rosita, gonna need your gun.</i>

152
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,641
Gonna do a sweep
of the brownstone.

153
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,227
I want to see what other
surprises are in here.

154
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,978
Hey, he's waking up.

155
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,532
Easy.

156
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,484

157
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,657
Where is he?

158
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,828
Where's Denise?

159
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,764
He took her, didn't he?

160
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,506
Let's get you up.

161
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,570
Maybe when they searched this
place, they missed something.

162
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:14,008
Depends if it was Aiden or Heath's
group who went through it.

163
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:16,794
Easy.

164
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,683
( growling )

165
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,968
Look in the Bibles, too.

166
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,686
Could've hollowed out the pages.

167
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:27,688
Are you serious?

168
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,557
<i>We have two bullets.</i>

169
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,526
People holed up in here--

170
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,864
people hide guns, ammo.

171
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,867
Maybe something to start a fire.

172
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:43,621
It's getting dark out soon.
Maybe we can distract them.

173
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,541
<i>We need sheets,
ropes, towels--</i>

174
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,010
<i>anything Maggie can use
to climb down the other side.</i>

175
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,340
How things turn.

176
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,476
Enid.

177
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,431
When I wanted to run...

178
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:17,355
you said, "That's
how you lose people...

179
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,527
even after they're gone."

180
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,117
What the hell does that mean?

181
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,122
People you love...

182
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,209
they made you who you are.

183
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:42,396
Glenn:
<i>They're still part of you.</i>

184
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,899
<i>If you stop being you,</i>

185
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:48,169
<i>that last bit of them that's still
around inside, who you are...</i>

186
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:51,806
<i>it's gone.</i>

187
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,143
Who are those people to you?

188
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,479
My parents.

189
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,482
A man named Dale.

190
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,653
Maggie's father, Hershel.

191
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,289
A woman named Andrea.
A man named Tyreese.

192
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,458
Who are they to you?

193
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,666
My parents.

194
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,005
Then they're still here...

195
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,507
'cause you're still here.

196
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:36,434
When there's an opening, we'll
make a break for that tower.

197
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,685
Hmm?

198
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,487
No, I'll just slow you down.

199
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,656
Denise.

200
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,443
Denise, you're here...

201
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,828
with me.

202
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,613
I need you.

203
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,035
Maybe I want you to stay

204
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,703
'cause I'm enjoying
your company so much.

205
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,204
( chuckles )

206
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,293
I want you to stay put.

207
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,544
What?

208
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,962
I wanted you to come back.

209
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,348
I can handle myself.
You said you wanted help.

210
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,350
No, I didn't want you
to give up on this place,

211
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,719
on these people, to be afraid.

212
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,021
You were right.

213
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,642
So I'm here now.

214
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,729
And I'm going out there
and I'm helping you.

215
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,649
We have to get her
off that platform.

216
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,818
She's hurt.
She needs help getting over the wall.

217
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,322
I can climb up the gate.
You can distract them.

218
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,074
We do it together.

219
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:37,578
( chuckles )
I'm just gonna follow you, anyway.

220
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,421
<i>You keep looking
for the Bible Glock...</i>

221
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,760
<i>I'll make her something
to climb down.</i>

222
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,766
Okay.

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,606
I like what you said before.

224
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,942
That I wasn't born this way.

225
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:11,779
You're right.

226
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,615
I changed.

227
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,818
And now I want
to help you change.

228
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,927
<i>Hey.</i>

229
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,764
You were right.

230
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,802
Let's get Maggie.

231
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,303
Can't you just stay here?

232
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,139
Nope.

233
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,109
You've been given
a gift, Denise.

234
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,614
You'll see that one day.

235
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,517
Or maybe you won't.

236
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,463

242

Honey, you can do it.

I guess you all thought that.

I was selfish.

00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,920
But maybe if I
wasn't so selfish,

309
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,756
I wouldn't have got that IV.

00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:50,825
Two IVs from the fridge and all
the clean towels you can find.

369
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:52,576
Aaron, grab the gurney.

370
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:02,920
This is a gunshot?

371
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:04,889
Michonne:
<i>Handgun. Close range.</i>

372
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,010
Please save him.

373
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,561
<i>Please.</i>

374
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:14,932
Spencer:
<i>That's gonna draw them here.</i>

375
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:16,684
Denise:
<i>I need light.</i>

376
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:19,770
<i>Michonne, towel.
Hold it here.</i>

377
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:21,939
<i>Okay, we need to keep
pressure on the wound.</i>

378
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:24,909
<i>I'll go in and sew up
any lacerations.</i>

379
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:26,444
<i>Just like that, right here.</i>

380
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:29,030
<i>Now, Spencer, I need that pan.</i>

381
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,115
<i>That one on the tray.
Good.</i>

382
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,284
<i>I'm going to clean
and close this.</i>

383
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:36,454
<i>Michonne, keep following me
with the towel.</i>

384
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:39,423
<i>( continues indistinctly )</i>

385
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:54,305
Michonne:
<i>What-- what are you doing?</i>

386
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:55,639
<i>Rick!</i>

387
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:59,226
<i>Rick!</i>

388
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:05,120
( walkers snarling )

389
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,990
( grunting )

390
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,624
- Rick's out there.
- Hold on.

391
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:27,058
- He needs my help.
- Just one more suture.

392
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,259
But he's out there.

393
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,929
This is his son.
Give me a second.

394
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,263
Aaron:
He's taking them all on.

395
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,732
- We have to go get him.
- What?

396
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,600
We have to.

397
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:37,936
- This is it.
- Denise: Okay, got it.

398
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,187
( kisses )

399
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:43,448
( laughing )

400
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,111
( snarling )

401
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,126
( grunting )

402
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,927
Knock 'em away.
Drive 'em down.

403
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,802
We can beat 'em.
We can beat 'em!

404
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:54,012
Rick: <i>Drive 'em back. That's it.</i>

405
00:31:54,014 --> 00:31:56,097
<i>We can do this together!</i>

406
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:01,269
( crying )

407
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,987
Will you take her?

408
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:06,357
Of course.

409
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,693
Come with me.
Okay, okay.

410
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:10,662
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

411
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,035
Gabriel.

412
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:20,705
What are you doing?

413
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:27,462
We've been praying...
together.

414
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:32,016
Praying that God
will save our town.

415
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,221
Well, our prayers
have been answered.

416
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:40,642
God will save Alexandria...

417
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:43,862
because God has given us the
courage to save it ourselves.

418
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:56,574
Guys, it's thinning
out there in front.

419
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,849
We need to get out there.
Rick's making a stand.

420
00:32:58,969 --> 00:32:59,926
Eugene:<i> How's that?</i>

421
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:02,747
He's out there fighting them
with Michonne and some others.

422
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:04,682
It's time.

423
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:07,085
Up the alley.
I'm going.

424
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,003
Denise is safe.

425
00:33:09,005 --> 00:33:10,505
Did you see her?

426
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:13,057
Yeah, she made it
to the infirmary.

427
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,310
- I'm gonna go help Rick.
- I'm going, too.

428
00:33:15,312 --> 00:33:17,428
- Tara: <i>I'm with you.</i>
- Rosita:<i> All right, me, too.</i>

429
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,231
- Eugene:<i> Right behind you.</i>
- Eugene, you don't have to.

430
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,484
That's incorrect.
I do.

431
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,652
No one gets to clock out today.

432
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:28,439
And, hell, this is a story
people are gonna tell.

433
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,575
( walkers snarling )

434
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:39,617
This way!
Come on!

436
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,896
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,053
No.

438
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,941
( gasping )

439
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:04,893
Go get her!

440
00:34:04,895 --> 00:34:06,444
Go get her!

441
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,982
- Hey!
- ( gunshots )

442
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:12,984

Enid!

450
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,873
Over here!
Over here, come on.

Can you get the gate?

469
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,938
Appreciate it, pal.

470
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:32,420
Come on, we got you.

471
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,395
- ( panting )
- What the hell happened?

472
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:43,848
I don't know.
I just got back.

473
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,766
Listen...

474
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,852
we can-- we can lead
some of them away,

475
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,103
but they're scattered.

476
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,605
No, we get 'em all together.

477
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,273
Won't have to lead 'em away.

478
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,611

481
00:36:58,608 --> 00:37:01,142
Move it!
Back up!

482
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,014
All right, that's it!

483
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:44,185

Don't let up!

00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:46,153
( muffled shouting, grunting )

( grunting )

486
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:01,856
I was wrong.

487
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:08,362
I thought after living behind
these walls for so long that...

488
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,834
maybe they couldn't learn.

489
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,040
But today...

490
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,210
I saw what they could do,

491
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:27,348
what<i> we</i> could do,

492
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,800
if we work together.

493
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,555
We'll rebuild the walls.

494
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,859
We'll expand the walls.

495
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,531
There will be more.
There's gotta be more.

496
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,785
Everything Deanna
was talking about...

497
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,207
is possible.

498
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:56,577
It's all possible.
I see that now.

499
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,919
When I was out there...

500
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,006
with them...

501
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,060
when it was over...

502
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,601
when I knew
we had this place again...

503
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,105
I had this feeling.

504
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,948
It took me a while

505
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,618
to remember what it was...

506
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,954
because I haven't felt it

507
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,791
since before I woke up
in that hospital bed.

508
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,465
( crying )
I want to show you the new world, Carl.

509
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,138
I want to make it
a reality for you.

510
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,060
Please, Carl...

511
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,782
let me show you.

512
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:13,287
Plea-- please, son,
don't die.
