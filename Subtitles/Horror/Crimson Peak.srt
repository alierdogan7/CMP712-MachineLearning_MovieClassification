just a metaphor.

The reflection
of who I am.

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,250
Now, you, sir,

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,686

a patch of land

179

and the will to
make it yield.

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,931
The least that you
can grant me

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,604
is the courtesy
of your time

182
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,206
and the chance to prove to you
and these fine gentlemen

183
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,930
that my will, dear sir,

184

is, at the very least,
as strong as yours.

Yes, you do,

and come along tonight.

Apparently, he's taken
an interest in young Eunice.

I saw you spying
on us, child.

197
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,808
Was his proposal
so outrageous

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,201
as to merit such a
harsh answer from you?

199
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,044
It wasn't his
proposal, my love.

200

It was him.

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,965
There's something about
him that I don't like.

What, I don't know.

203

not knowing.

Six basic steps,
and that's all.

311
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,890
However, it is said that
the true test of the perfect waltz

312
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,610
is for it to
be so swift,

313
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,171
so delicate

314
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,288
and so smooth

315
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,406
that a candle flame will not be extinguished
in the hand of the lead dancer.

316
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,770

the perfect partner.

is easy to fake.

355
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,321
However, with
glass plates

356
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,926
it is, by definition,
impossible.

357
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,128
I got these in London.

358
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,611
They're genuine.

359
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,401
The image is captured using
a coating of silver salts,

360
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,767
invisible to the naked eye.

361
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,770
It's called
a latent image.

362
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,008
Now, it's my belief
that houses,

363
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,846
places, be it by chemical
compounds in the earth

364
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,731
or the minerals in the stone
can retain impressions

365
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,606
or a person that is
no longer living.

366
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,325
But not everyone
can see them.

367
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,885
The man that just left,

368
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,122
amongst other ailments,
is color blind.

369
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,326
Now, that man will never
perceive the colors red or green.

370
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,848
He only accepts their existence because
the majority around him does.

371
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,685
Perhaps we only
notice things

372
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,969
when the time comes
for us to see them.

373
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,486
(CHUCKLES)

374
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,680
You've never spoken to me
about these interests of yours, Alan.

375
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,683
You've never given
me the chance.

376
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,451
Edith, I understand your
fascination with the Sharpes,

377
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,608
but in your own
best interest,

378
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,524
proceed with caution
is all I ask.

379
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,331
You've been gone
a long time and, well,

380
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,648
I've managed somewhat.

381
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,371
THOMAS: (CHUCKLES)
No, Edith.

382
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,569
I think every time I read it,
it gets better and better.

383
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,688
And I don't mind
the love story at all.

384
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,887
Just a chapter or two.

385
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,485
Well, I like it.

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,166
Let me know
what you think.

387
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,049
I'll finish it now.

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,525
Is it a butterfly?

389
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,286
No.

390
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,244
But it will be soon.

391
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,164
Oh, I hadn't
seen them.

392
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,004
They're dying.

393
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,245
They take their heat
from the sun

394
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,681
and when it deserts them,
they die.

395
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,531
That's sad.

396
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,160
No, it's not sad,
Edith. It's nature.

397
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,368
It's a savage world
of things dying

398
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,091
or eating each other,
right beneath our feet.

399
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,561
Surely there's
more to it than that.

400
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,849
Beautiful things
are fragile.

401
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,401
At home, we have
only black moths.

402
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,842
Formidable creatures,
to be sure,

403
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,524
but they lack beauty.

404
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,200
They thrive on the
dark and the cold.

405
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,724
What do they
feed on?

406
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,969
Butterflies,
I'm afraid.

407
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,729
Are you sure
about this?

408
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,728
I don't think she's the right choice.
She's too young.

409
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,405
She's just
a child, Thomas.

410
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,483
Lucille, I've
explained all this.

411
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,165
I will need the ring.

412
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,090
The ring's mine.

413
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,810
I earned it.

414
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,809
I will want it back.

415
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,767
Then you'd better
hope I'm successful.

416
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,961
This is the last thing
we have to sell.

417
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,929
You're not selling it.

418
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,362
We are buying
something with it.

419
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,641
Mr. Holly.
Is something the matter?

420
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,961
Mr. Cushing.

421
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,731
It is not often that I am
the bearer of bad news,

422
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,124
but when I am,
I insist upon delivering it myself.

423
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,684
Don't open it here.

424
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,690
(WHISPERS)
Now is the time.

425
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,925
Edith, may I
have a word?

426
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,760
Just one moment.
Let me get my father.

427
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,361
(KNOCKING)

428
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,051
Father.
Everybody's waiting.

429
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,960
I'll be there shortly.

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,128
Miss Cushing.

431
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,521
Edith. I really have no
right to ask this, but...

432
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,601
Sir Thomas.

433
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,642
May I speak with you
in my study, please?

434
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,168
You and your sister,
if you would be so kind as to fetch her.

435
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,284
Child, please tell our guests that
we will join them presently.

436
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,763
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

437
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,049
Now, Lady Lucille.

438
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,730
Sir Thomas,
the first time we met

439
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,726
I imagine it was hard for
you to realize that I didn't like you.

440
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,405
You made that
clear enough, sir.

441
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,721
But I had hoped that
now, with time...

442
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,326
Your time, Sir Thomas,
is up.

443
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,482
LUCILLE: Could you speak
plainly, Mr. Cushing?

444
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,444
Plain I will be, missy.

445
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,284
Plainer than you
might like to hear.

446
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
In the past few days

447
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,404
your brother has
deemed it fine enough

448
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,324
to mix business with pleasure

449
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,006
by repeatedly engaging
socially with my daughter.

450
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,324
My only daughter.

451
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,164
Sir, I'm aware that I have
no position to offer,

452
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,765
but the fact is...

453
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,763
You are falling
in love with her.

454
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,604
Is that it?

455
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,729
You play the part well.

456
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,409
The other day, my daughter asked me
why I didn't like you.

457
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,331
Honestly, at the time,
I had no good answer.

458
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,487
But now, I do.

459
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,367
That document there
gave me my answer.

460
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,444
That's the first honest
reaction I've seen from you.

461
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,441
Does she know?

462
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,767
No.

463
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,964
But I will tell her,

464
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,646
if that's what it takes
to send you on your way.

465
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,123
Sir, I know you will
find this hard to believe...

466
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,406
You love her.

467
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,641
I know.

468
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,807
You're repeating yourself.

469
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,601
Now, you,

470
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,802
you seem to be the more
collected one, dear.

471
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,003
It's overly
generous, I know.

472
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,640
But if you want that check to clear,
there are two conditions.

473
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
There's a train for New York City leaving
first thing tomorrow morning.

474
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,530
You and your brother
better be on it.

475
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,491
Do we understand
each other?

476
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,721
We do.

477
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,485
What is the second
condition?

478
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,244
That concerns my daughter.

479
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,209
Tonight you must

480
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,687
thoroughly break
her heart.

481
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,611
(CLINKING)

482
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,930
Ladies and gentlemen,

483
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,685
we have an unexpected
announcement.

484
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,685
Sir Thomas.

485
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
(WHISPERING)
Thank you, Mr. Cushing.

486
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,170
Ladies and gentlemen,

487
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,844
when I first came to
America, my heart was

488
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,162
brimming with a
sense of adventure.

489
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,531
Here, the future actually
seemed to mean something.

490
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,800
I have found warmth and
friendship among you all.

491
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,891
But for now,

492
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,366
farewell.

493
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,684
May we meet again.

494
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,042
Perhaps on
a different shore.

495
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,201
My sister and I
depart for England

496
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,324
just in time
for the winter.

497
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,247
To lasting friendship.

498
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,322
ALL: To lasting friendship.

499
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,721
(SOFTLY)
Excuse me. Sorry.

500
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,091
Edith.

501
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,564
You're leaving us.

502
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,080
We must return home immediately
and attend to our interests.

503
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,568
And with nothing to
hold us in America...

504
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,721
I see.

505
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,844
Your novel.

506
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,367
I read the new chapters.
I'll have them delivered in the morning.

507
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,521
That's very good of you,
thank you.

508
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,840
Would you still like
to know my thoughts?

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,411
If we must.

510
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,726
It's absurdly sentimental.

511
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,611
The aches that you describe
with such earnestness.

512
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,250
The pain, the loss.

513
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,680
You clearly haven't
lived at all.

514
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,449
In fact, you only seem to know
what other writers tell you.

515
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,567
That's enough!

516
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,244
You insist on describing
the torments of love

517
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,924
when you clearly know
nothing about them.

518
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,371
I'm not done yet!

519
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,766
What do you dream of?

520
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,604
A kind man?

521
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,967
A pure soul
to be redeemed?

522
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,770
A wounded bird
you can nourish?

523
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,611
Perfection.

524
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,811
Perfection has no
place in love, Edith.

525
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,247
I advise you to return
to your ghosts and fancies.

526
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,486
The sooner, the better.

527
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,767
You know precious little
of the human heart, or love,

528
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,924
or the pain that
comes with it.

529
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,764
You're nothing but
a spoiled child!

not a good time.

896

There.

897
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,928
It should feel
better soon.

898
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,530
My hands are
getting rough.

899
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,370
Your father
would approve.

900
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,891

never work.

901
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,485

Who did you marry?

905
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,442
A failure.
Don't say that.

906
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,409
You're all that I have.

907
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,562
The men leave
at nightfall.

908
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,121
We'll be racing
against the snow.

909
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,760
Soon we won't be able
to make any progress.

910
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,320
That's when you'll find out
why they call this Crimson Peak.

912
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,327
What did you say?

913
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,605
Crimson Peak.

914
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,966
That's what they call it.

915
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,124
The ore and the red clay leach up
from the ground and stain the snow.

916
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,248
It turns
bright red, so,

917
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,446
"Crimson Peak."

for the best.</i>

920
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,129
Edith seems to have found happiness,
don't you agree?

921
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,011
I wouldn't know.
I haven't heard a word.

922
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,321
I have.

923
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,165
She has asked me to transfer
all her assets to England.

924
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:31,211
Seems to be investing
all of it in that clay machine of his,

925
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,203
and I have no recourse
but to obey.

The manner of Cushing's death,
the impact on his head.

928
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,681
The last check Cushing made
was to Sir Thomas Sharpe.

929
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,644
If I may confide.

930
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,565
Before Cushing died,
he hired a New York man,

931
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,370
Mr. Holly.

932
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,364
Now, he digs up
these unsavory facts.

933
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,731
The fact that this Holly
got involved in all this,

934
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,530
just gives me pause.

01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,122
How could she know
about Mother?

973
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,960
I have no idea.
I haven't told her a thing.

974

trying to do?

some fresh air.

out of here.

You're Lady Sharpe,

Forgive me, mum,
but there's a few letters for you.

Two of them are certified

And another one comes all
the way from Milan, Italy.

992

anyone in Italy.

01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,562

We ought to leave soon.

Otherwise we won't make
it back to the house.

yes, in Cumberland, England, sir.

Mr. Holly.
At your service, sir.

1005
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,371
Did you bring the copy
of the information?

1006
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,800
It took some time to obtain
that newspaper clipping.

1007
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,040
It's damn gruesome,
if you ask me.

1008
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,484
It's a shame.

1009
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,487
The only relevant information I could pass
to Mr. Cushing were the civil documents.

1010
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,722
But it was enough to impede
any further relationship

1011
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,246
between Sir Thomas
and Miss Cushing.

1012
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,485
Prevent them
from marrying.

1013
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,166
Why was that?

1014
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,246
Because, you see,

1015
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,527
Sir Thomas is
already married.

1016
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,289
This fellow, Cavendish,
your hero.

1017
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,842
There's a darkness
to him. I like him.

1018
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,400
Does he make it
all the way through?

1019
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:26,481
It's entirely
up to him.

1020
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,607
What do you mean?
Characters talk to you.

1021
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,081
They transform.
They make choices.

1022
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,605
Choices.

1023
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,489
As to who
they become.

1024
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:45,131
Well, (CHUCKLES) this is rather dismal,
I'm sorry to say.

But at least it's warm.

1026
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,171
Oh, I like it
much better.

1027
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,129
Better than what?

1028
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,801
Better than the house.

die with the mines.
