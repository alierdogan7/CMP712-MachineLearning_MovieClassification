1
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,460
In this world...

2
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:11,237
Is the destiny of mankind controlled
by some transcendental entity or Law?

3
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:15,066
Is it like the hand of
God hovering above?

4
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:18,078
At least it is true...

5
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:22,111
...that man has no
control, even over his own will.

6
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:03,648
Oh Prince...

7
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:07,829
Oh Prince of the eternally unforgiven...

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,124
We greet you with honor to
marvel at what you have become.

9
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:30,409
We shall meet again in another world...

10
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:37,615
We are your kinsmen...

11
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:05,077
Feel no shame about shape.

12
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:07,018
Weather changes the phrase.

13
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:10,751
Even mother will
show you another way.

14
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:13,156
So, put your glasses on.

15
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,220
Nothing will be wrong.

16
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,424
There's no blame, there's no fame.

17
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,261
It's up to you.

18
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:22,927
The first words should be found.

19
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,531
Whatever holds you back.

20
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:27,935
I...

21
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:29,039
...can...

22
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:31,204
I can get it off.

23
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:32,245
Tell me what...

24
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:33,211
Tell me what...

25
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,044
Tell me what you want.

26
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,208
I don't know why...

27
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:37,148
I don't know why...

28
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:39,118
I don't know why you are afraid.

29
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,288
Tell me what...

30
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:41,253
Tell me what...

31
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,914
Tell me what you'd say.

32
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,251
I don't know why...

33
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:45,360
I don't know why...

34
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,156
Too late...

35
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,786
It's too late.

36
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:31,329
Are you sure there's a secret
passage in this dismal place?

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,369
Our sources are reliable.

38
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:37,872
If this passage can be found so
easily I'll give up being a mercenary.

39
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:41,777
Found it.

40
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:44,744
Giving up, huh?

41
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:46,685
Pippin.

42
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:01,965
There's no mistake.

43
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:02,729
This is it.

44
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:04,400
Right, let's go.

45
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:05,531
Wait a minute.

46
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,472
I understand that Pippin and
Judeau need to come along...

47
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:11,405
...but you're the commander now,
are you sure you should come?

48
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:13,138
If something were to happen to you...

49
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:16,215
Our mission is to rescue Griffith.

50
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:18,314
We have the highest
chance of succeeding...

51
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:21,117
...in our mission if all four of our
strongest members take on the operation.

52
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:22,548
Yeah, but...

53
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:25,827
You're worried, aren't you?

54
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:27,627
Don't make me laugh!

55
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:30,756
I'm a stronger
swordsman than either of them.

56
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,168
Don't bring your
personal feelings into this matter.

57
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:35,635
Obey your commander's orders!

58
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,200
Remember...

59
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:42,574
...I can still cover your back.

60
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:43,576
Don't forget.

61
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:46,006
Yeah...

62
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:49,313
Let's go.

63
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,534
Griffith...

64
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,678
You were always
looking up to the sky...

65
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,310
...thinking of nothing else
but to keep climbing and soaring...

66
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,716
A hawk flying alone,
reaching for the highest point...

67
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,759
That's right...

68
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,696
You were always
watching us from above...

69
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:38,765
Never here on the
ground with the rest of us...

70
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:42,527
Calm, cool and never missing a beat.

71
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:47,431
Do you really need a reason...

72
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:50,711
...each time I decide to lay
my life on the line for you?

73
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:54,841
Letting nothing stand
in your path to victory...

74
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:58,549
Do you think that I am dreadful?

75
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,584
Griffith couldn't go on without you!

76
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,660
If that's true...

77
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,720
If that's the real truth...

78
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,131
Then I...

79
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,547
Pull yourself together.

80
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:28,947
Griffith will be back soon.

81
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,310
There's no way in hell I'm going to die...

82
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,047
...not without seeing Griffith...

83
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:36,523
Even if I have a
thousand more stitches in me...

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,785
Ricket, we need some more water.

85
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:40,691
Got it.

86
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:45,258
When Griffith returns...

87
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,928
It'll be the
resurrection of the Band of Hawk!

88
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:58,010
Everyone is in good spirits...

89
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:02,009
Because, Griffith will be back soon...

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,286
As long as Griffith comes back, then...

91
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,307
A fairy?

92
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:36,916
I saw it...

93
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,613
...with my very own
eyes, there's no doubt.

94
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:47,987
The enemy?

95
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:49,394
Why at this time?

96
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:53,527
Just a little more...

97
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,162
All we needed was a little more
time and Griffith would be back!

98
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:59,398
We can't let them destroy us, not now!

99
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:13,443
Hey...

100
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,314
Where is everyone?

101
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,190
Run...

102
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,478
Run...

103
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,140
Ricket...

104
00:09:12,848 --> 00:09:13,837
It can't...

105
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:15,978
This can't be real!

106
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,069
What...

107
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:47,478
What's going on?

108
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,660
I'm amazed we learned
about this secret passage.

109
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:04,960
We have supporters inside.

110
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:10,699
Wait.

111
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:12,840
Supporters of the
resistance movement...

112
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,482
You must be the Band of the Hawk.

113
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,484
We are at your service.

114
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:24,951
I am Caska of the Band of the Hawk.

115
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,379
What do you mean by supporters?

116
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,723
They're from Princess Charlotte.

117
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,416
Oh...

118
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:32,856
We don't have very
much time until dawn.

119
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,792
We must get to where Griffith's
being kept as soon as possible.

120
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:37,422
Yes.

121
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:59,077
We'll take it from here.

122
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,789
In this darkness not a single
ray of light can find its way through.

123
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:46,732
How long have I been
lying here in this darkness?

124
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,095
For an eternity...

125
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,642
At times it feels like just a moment...

126
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,673
I feel nothing...

127
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:03,448
It's as if my body is floating in space...

128
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:08,512
Am I preserving my sanity?

129
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:13,161
Or has it already been lost long ago?

130
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,023
And yet...

131
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,862
...in this world like a hollow shell...

132
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,701
...one thing is clear in my mind...

133
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,441
Him alone...

134
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,971
...like lightning
splitting through the darkness...

135
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,009
He appears in my mind so vividly.

136
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:43,521
Over and over again
like the waves of a tsunami...

137
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,218
...hatred...

138
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,549
...friendship...

139
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:48,086
...jealousy...

140
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:49,822
...frustration...

141
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:51,423
...helplessness...

142
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,159
...affection...

143
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,526
...sadness...

144
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:58,599
They all come
together into a giant vortex...

145
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:04,109
They keep my
consciousness from fading away.

146
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:11,484
Guts, the cause of my
confinement in this darkness...

147
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:13,619
Will now...

148
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:16,919
...be the source of my life!

149
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:22,022
This man whose life
was once in my hands...

150
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:26,897
At what time did I fall under his control?

151
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:31,596
And now...

152
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:37,069
In my mind I see him radiating
so brightly it pierces my eyes.

153
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:40,272
Guts!

154
00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:52,789
Griffith?

155
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,253
Griffith?

156
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:57,896
Is he in a different cell?

157
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,201
No, he has to be
here, on the lowest level.

158
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:13,542
Griffith?

159
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:14,707
Grif...

160
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:22,215
Gri...

161
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:23,982
Griffith...

162
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:43,101
The tendons in his arms
and legs have been slashed...

163
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:47,173
And his tongue...

164
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,713
Caska, the keys!

165
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:52,381
Caska!

166
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:13,741
Stay there!

167
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,535
Stay where you are!

168
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,247
This isn't possible.

169
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,450
This can't be Griffith...

170
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:40,462
Guts...

171
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,332
Griffith!

172
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,975
There's no escaping now...

173
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:37,849
The guards and soldiers
will be here any minute...

174
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:43,958
And in a year, you'll all
be looking just like him...

175
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:47,728
You bastard...

176
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:53,332
So you're the bastard
who destroyed his body...

177
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,403
That's right.

178
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,712
I haven't had that
much fun in a long time.

179
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,080
You don't come across a
specimen as splendid as him very often.

180
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:06,015
When you're as experienced as
I am in the profession of torture.

181
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:08,749
...not only do you
appreciate beauty on the surface...

182
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:14,320
...but also the beauty that lies beneath
the skin, in tendons, muscles, and veins.

183
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:18,030
He really was exquisite.

184
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,562
There's no use.

185
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:24,401
This door is four times
thicker than your average door.

186
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,329
Don't move!

187
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,057
Put down your weapons and surrender!

188
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,396
Stick with me and don't fall back!

189
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:55,264
Guts!

190
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:08,072
How dare you?

191
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:09,241
What the hell are you doing?

192
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:10,215
Shoot them!

193
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,391
You idiots!

194
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,455
Who said to retreat?

195
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:26,659
Hold your ground!

196
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:33,237
Hurry!

197
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:35,940
What's taking them so long!

198
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,138
There's thirty of our
soldiers after just four of them!

199
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:40,579
How can it be so difficult?

200
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,407
Yes, but sir...

201
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:45,282
...they're led by that
man, the hundred-man killer!

202
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:46,411
Don't be stupid!

203
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:50,488
You don't expect them to come here
just to rescue their commander, do you?

204
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:51,286
No...

205
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,325
Besides, myths like that
are born in times of war...

206
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,593
...when stories get exaggerated.

207
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,504
There is no man in the world who can
kill a hundred armed men with his sword.

208
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,432
At the very most, ten soldiers.

209
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,215
That is definitely him...

210
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,483
The ruthless commander
of the Band of the Hawk...

211
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,218
Guts!

212
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,390
It's Hundred-Man Guts himself!

213
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:32,659
Surround him,
what are you waiting for?

214
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,133
Seize him!

215
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:34,964
But sir...

216
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,428
You idiots!

217
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:41,202
He's been swinging his huge sword
around and chasing after our men...

218
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,903
He's out of breath.

219
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:45,636
You fools!

220
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:51,047
If your enemy sees you
hesitating, you've already lost the battle.

221
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,788
Taste battle, and pay for this
lesson on ruthlessness with your life.

222
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:00,557
Guts!

223
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:07,165
Advance!

224
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,106
Where are they?

225
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:16,006
See, it's too much
for just the four of them...

226
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:17,140
No...

227
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:18,679
You're wrong, they'll be back.

228
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:20,307
I'm sure of it.

229
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:34,289
Guts...

230
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:16,199
What a disgrace!

231
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:20,435
If we let them get away
the King will not forgive us.

232
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:22,406
Pursue them!

233
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:25,368
We'll get ahead of them
and wait for their arrival.

234
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:26,105
Yes sir!

235
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:05,379
Looking back, the morning comes.

236
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:09,014
Don't find your face in your glass.

237
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:13,058
Take the moonlight by the tail.

238
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:16,028
It's a rainy sight that you're shading.

239
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,291
What is that?

240
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,561
It's just the same.

241
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:23,729
What is trying on your crown?

242
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:27,908
I'm spending my
glass and walking back.

243
00:22:27,976 --> 00:22:31,241
So wear my glass, you're fading.

244
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:34,879
I'm waiting so long.

245
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,218
I'm waiting so long.

246
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,946
I'm waiting so long.

247
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,623
I'm waiting...

248
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:11,713
Beloved thoughts...

249
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:13,014
The will to live...

250
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:17,117
All is lost at the end of their journey.

251
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,320
Their hearts bleed...

252
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:22,824
...full of regret and
sorrow as they stand idle.

253
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:26,798
In this world, will mankind survive?

254
00:23:27,568 --> 00:23:31,834
Can only the wind
foretell the end of their dreams?
