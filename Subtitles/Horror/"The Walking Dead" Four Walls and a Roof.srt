1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:03,586
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:05,438
- Gabriel...
- You said you had a church.

3
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:08,595
I don't trust this guy.
He's hiding something.

4
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:10,876
This was the food bank.
Served the whole county.

5
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:13,546
- We have to get Gabriel.
- What happened?

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:14,891
I don't know.

7
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,838
We get Eugene to Washington,
and he will make the dead die

8
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,842
and the living will have
this world again.

9
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:22,142
We're in!
Let's do it.

10
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,048
Good news is, you're not dead.

11
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:28,376
But at the end of the day,

12
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,649
a man's got to eat.

13
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:33,986
(breathing rapidly)

14
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:49,056
Gareth: <i>It's probably
pretty stupid to be here.</i>

15
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:51,744
<i>Dangerous.</i>

16
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,246
<i>I don't know, maybe not.</i>

17
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,747
(snarling)

18
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:59,856
<i>You can see the threat.</i>

19
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:02,442
<i>That's something.</i>

20
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:05,478
<i>Looking at them makes me</i>
<i>feel better about things.</i>

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,148
<i>My mom used to say that every
day above ground was a win.</i>

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,201
<i>Doesn't really</i>
<i>apply anymore, but...</i>

23
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:14,537
<i>you can still get</i>
<i>some perspective.</i>

24
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:24,330
The glass is gonna break
sooner or later.

25
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,217
Nothing lasts too long anymore.

26
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:33,506
You know, we marked our way here

27
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:36,175
so that we could find
our way back after.

28
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:40,897
So stupid, right?
I mean...

29
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:42,565
back to what?

30
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:56,612
It wasn't just a trap.
It was gonna be a choice.

31
00:01:56,614 --> 00:02:00,066
You join us or feed us.

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,370
You know...

33
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:06,456
bears...

34
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:11,794
when they start to starve,
they eat their young.

35
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:13,963
If the bear dies,
the cub dies anyway.

36
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,098
But if the bear lives,

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,217
it can always have another cub.

38
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,974
That was part of the pitch.

39
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:30,813
You know, Greg and Mike
came this close

40
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:34,567
to nabbing that grey-haired
queen bitch who killed my mom.

41
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,903
She drove away with the archer.

42
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,905
Greg saw them pull away.

43
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:42,625
Can't wait to try her.

44
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:44,577
I like women better.

45
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,412
Most of us do.

46
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,831
My brother Alex has--

47
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,134
also currently dead
because of Rick--

48
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:57,423
he had a theory that it was
because of the extra layer of fat

49
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:00,726
that women have, you know,
for childbearing.

50
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:02,845
Even the skinny girls have it.

51
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:08,935
Like that pretty one--
Sasha?

52
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,604
I think pretty people
taste better, too.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,450
We're going to get all of them.

54
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:27,003
But for starters,
you'll do just fine.

55
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,705
We did a good job on your leg.

56
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:32,842
- (sobbing)
- We've had practice.

57
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,012
When we started, it was
about making it slow.

58
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:41,684
I'm being a human being here.
I'm talking to you.

59
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:44,637
Perspective, Bob.

60
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,472
You're above ground.

61
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:48,357
At least you're
better off than them.

62
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,560
(laughing)

63
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,706
Well, he lost it.

64
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,075
Lasted longer than
I thought he would.

65
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:08,244
(laughing continues)

66
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:10,079
You...

67
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,665
you idiots.

68
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,834
- Okay, keep it down.
- <i> (pounding on glass)</i>

69
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,471
I can shut him up.

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,894
I've been bitten,
you stupid pricks!

71
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:27,847
I'm tainted meat.

72
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,816
- (laughing)
- (spitting)

73
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:40,443
- Let's just kill him now.
- No, no, we need him.

74
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,911
We might as well
be eating one of them.

75
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,245
What the hell's gonna happen?

76
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,697
Are we gonna turn?
Are we just gonna die?

77
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,749
Albert, calm the hell down.
We cooked him.

78
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,367
Everything is gonna be fine.

79
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,119
Why the hell didn't
you check him first?

80
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,871
'Cause he was fine.

81
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:55,007
- Tainted meat!
- Gareth:<i> Shut up.</i>

82
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,627
- You eating tainted meat!
- I said shut up!

83
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,300

- He's getting away.
- Who?

94
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:27,291
Somebody was watching us.

95
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,460
If we go in there now,

96
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,262
some of us aren't coming back.

Bob is out there somewhere.

Scared, alone.

99
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,218
Maybe not alone.

100
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,270
Daryl and Carol
are missing, too.

105
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:15,840
What are you doing?

106
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:18,809
This is all connected.

107
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,228
You show up,

108
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,597
we're being watched,

109
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,018

111
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:32,189
I don't...

112
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:34,742
I don't have anything
to do with this.

113
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,661
- Wait!
- Rosita: Don't!

114
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:41,032
- Tyreese: Sasha, put it away.
- Who's out there?

115

I-- I don't have
anything...

00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:45,252
- to do with this.
- Where are our people?

117
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:47,371
- I don't have anything to--
- Where are our people?!

118
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:49,090
Please, I don't have
anything to do with this.

119
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:50,541
I--

120
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:57,381
Why'd you bring us here?

121
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:01,552
Please, I--

122
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:04,138
You working with someone?

123
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,190
I'm alone.
I'm alone.

124
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,691
I was always alone.

125
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:09,610
What about the woman
in the food bank, Gabriel?

126
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,946
What did you do to her?

127
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:14,365
"You'll burn for this."

128
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,617
That was for you. Why?

129
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,736
What are you gonna
burn for, Gabriel?

130
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:21,705
What?
What did you do?

131
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:23,958
What did you do?!

132
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,132
I lock the doors at night.

133
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:32,633
I always lock
the doors at night.

134
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,585
I always lock the doors
at night.

135
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:36,470
I always--

136
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:45,096
They started coming,
my congregation.

137
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,433
Atlanta was bombed the night
before and they were scared.

138
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:51,936
They were-- they were
looking for a safe place,

139
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,155
a place where they felt safe.

140
00:08:57,443 --> 00:09:00,027
And it was so early.
It was so early.

141
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:03,914
And the doors were still locked.

142
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:09,954
You see...

143
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,925
it was my choice.

144
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,262
<i>There were so many of them</i>

145
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:20,798
<i>and they were trying</i>
<i>to pry the shutters</i>

146
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,717
and banging on the sidings,
screaming at me.

147
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:26,720
And so the dead came for them.

148
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:30,975
Women...

149
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:34,979
children.

150
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:44,655
Entire families calling my
name as they were torn apart,

151
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,490
begging me for mercy.

152
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,659

Begging me for mercy.

153
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,496
Damning me to hell.

154
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,588
I buried their bones.

155
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,506
I buried it all.

156
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:12,816
The Lord sent you here
to finally punish me.

157
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,410
I'm damned.

158
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,864
I was damned before.

159
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,417
I always lock the doors.

160
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,038

I was in the graveyard.
Somebody knocked me out.

I woke up outside this place.

<i>And five other ones.</i>

179

right in front of me.

Like it was nothing.

181
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:50,745
All proud like they
had it all figured out.

182
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,332
Did they have Daryl and Carol?

183
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:59,087
Gareth said they drove off.

184
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,975
(groaning)

185
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:06,094
He's in pain.
Do we have anything?

186
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:08,430
I think there are pill packets
in the first aid kit.

187
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:10,515
- Yeah.
- Save 'em.

188
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,984
- No.
- Really.

189
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,225
It happened at the food bank.

190
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:42,630
It's okay.

191
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,224
Bob?

192
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:58,897
There's a sofa in my office.

193
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,484
<i>I know it's not much, but...</i>

194
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,204
Thank you.

195
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,124
I got him.

196
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:15,547
Do you know the place
Bob was talking about?

197
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:17,882
It's an elementary school.

198
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,918
- It's close.
- How close?

199
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,340
How close, Gabriel?

200
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:31,062
It's just a 10-minute walk
through the woods from here,

201
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,097
due south of the graveyard.

202
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,767
(Judith crying)

203
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,819
Shh, shh, shh.

204
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,573
Does he have a fever?

205
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,441
He's just warm.

206
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:47,445
Jim lasted almost two days
before we left him.

207
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,282
Time for a reality check.

208
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,701
We all need to leave
for DC right now.

209
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,206
Daryl and Carol
are gonna be back.

210
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,258
We're not going
anywhere without them.

211
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,794
I respect that, but there's a
clear threat here to Eugene.

212
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:05,346
I need to extract his ass
before things get any uglier.

213
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,131
<i>So if y'all won't come,</i>
<i>good luck to you.</i>

214
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,133
We'll go our separate ways.

215
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:12,887
You leaving on foot?

216
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,558
We fixed that
damn bus ourselves.

217
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,226
There are a lot more of us.

218
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:21,563
You want to keep it that way?
You should come.

219
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,616
Carol saved your life.
We saved your life.

220
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:27,068
Well, I am trying to save yours.

221
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,903
Save everyone's.

222
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:31,239
We're not going anywhere
without our people.

223
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,458
- Your people took off.
- They're coming back.

224
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,210
To what,
picked-over bones?!

225
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:36,995
- You're not taking--
- Do not lay hands!

226
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:40,915
- Abraham!
- Hey, hey, stop! Now!

227
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:46,054
Do you really think that
you're gonna be any safer

228
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:48,189
leaving right now
in the middle of the night?

229
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,858
Yeah.

230
00:14:51,294 --> 00:14:52,810
Yeah.

231
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:54,929
Glenn:
<i>What about tomorrow?</i>

232
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:57,265
We need each other for this.

233
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,901
We need each other to get to DC.

234
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,186
We can get through
all of it together.

235
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:06,441
I have an idea.

236
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,863
If you stay just
one more day and help,

237
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,699
I'll go with you to DC
no matter what.

238
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:19,370
Okay?

239
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:25,293
Glenn and Maggie, too.

240
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:28,713
- No.
- Good luck, then.

241
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:31,182
I'm not interested in breaking
up what you have here.

242
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,053
Rosita, grab your gear.

243
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,437
- Abraham--
- Now.

244
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:39,774
Eugene, let's go.
Eugene.

245
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:43,194
Move it.

246
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:45,897
- I don't want to.
- Now.

247
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,482
Okay.

248
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,995
You're not taking the bus.

249
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:08,002
Try to stop me.

250
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,765
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

251
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,517
Hey, hey, hey!

252
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:28,022
You stay--

253
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:31,242
you stay and help us,

254
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:33,411
and we will go with you.

255
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,446
- No.
- It's not your call.

256
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:41,753
You stay, help us.

257
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,211
Half a day.

258
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,215
Come high noon,
we're taillights.

259
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:58,186
I'm not waiting for the
other damn shoe to drop.

260
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:00,605
And we will leave with you.

261
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,646
12 hours.

262
00:17:10,734 --> 00:17:12,450
Then we go.

263
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,749
Bob: <i>You know, the
one good thing</i>

264
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,918
about getting
kicked in my face--

265
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:35,590
made me forget
the pain in my leg.

266
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:42,680
And my side, so two good things.

267
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,099
We're not playing
that game anymore.

268
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,155
Well...

269
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,941
all things considered,

270
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:57,278
figured you could
humor me a little bit.

271
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,697
(chuckles)

272
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:08,206
Why didn't you tell me

273
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,174
when it happened?

274
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,793
I knew

275
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:16,899
when I told you,

276
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,835
it'd become all about the end.

277
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:27,208
And I really liked the middle.

278
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:49,608
Rick: <i>They think
they're in control.</i>

279
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,461
<i>We're in here</i>
<i>and they could be anywhere.</i>

280
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:55,380
But we know exactly
where they are.

281
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,720
Plan's got stones,
I'll give you that.

282
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:04,973
- Make our move before they do.
- That's right.

283
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:07,225
They're not counting
on us thinking straight.

284
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:10,362
Are we?

285
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:13,482
I'm just making sure.
It's a big play.

286
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,502
Remember what these people
are capable of.

287
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,678
- Tyreese.
- Yeah?

288
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:30,148
You up for this?

289
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:34,119
I'm going with you.

290
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,139
You should stay with Bob.

291
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,891
No, I want to be out there.

292
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:42,010
I want to be a part of this.

293
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:01,113
I know how it feels.

294
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:04,366
But this right here,

295
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:07,219
the time you could
have with him,

296
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:10,388
you can't throw that away.

297
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,626
I wish I had it with Karen.

298
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:24,736
Do you remember how you felt?

299
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,641
What you wanted to do?

300
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,213
Yeah.

301
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:37,916
It made it so I couldn't see it.

302
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,187
Forgiveness.

303
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,823
That's facing it.

304
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:47,225
I should forgive them?

305
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,198
For hurting him?
For trying to kill us?

306
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,169
What the hell is wrong with you?

307
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,371
You think we have a choice?

308
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:01,807
Not all of us.

309
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:03,909
Just you.

310
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:06,812
When he opens his eyes,

311
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:09,681
the only thing he's gonna
want to see is your face.

312
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:18,573
Take it.

313
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:28,366
- If he stops breathing...
- Sasha.

314
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,368
...you put it
through his temple.

315
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:36,641
That's what Bob would want.

316
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:06,705
<i>(lock clicks)</i>

317
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,707
(tapping)

318
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,249
(walkers snarling)

319
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:04,522
Gareth: <i>Well, I guess
you know we're here.</i>

320
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:12,364
And we know you're here.

321
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:18,703
And we're armed.

322
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,875
So there's really no point
in hiding anymore.

323
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,939
We've been watching you.

324
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,228
We know who's here.

325
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:49,734
There's Bob,

326
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,370
unless you've put him
out of his misery already.

327
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,207
<i>And Eugene.</i>

328
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,378
<i>Rosita.</i>

329
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,581
<i>Martin's good friend Tyreese.</i>

330
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,303
<i>Carl.</i>

331
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,760
Judith.

332
00:25:18,648 --> 00:25:21,816
Rick and the rest walked out

333
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,436
with a lot of your guns.

334
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:33,995
Listen, we don't know
where you all are,

335
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:36,030
but this isn't a big place.

336
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:42,620
<i>So let's just stop this now</i>

337
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:44,989
<i>before things get more painful</i>
<i>than they need to be.</i>

338
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,687
(rattling)

339
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,485
Look, you're behind
one of these two doors

340
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:15,820
and we have more than enough
firepower to take down both.

341
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:18,540
Can't imagine that's
what you all want.

342
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,992
(cocks gun)

343
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:26,915
How about the priest?

344
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:33,805
Father, you help us
wrap this up,

345
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,974
<i>we'll let you walk away</i>
<i>from this.</i>

346
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:43,148
<i>Just open the door</i>
<i>and you can go.</i>

347
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,083
<i>You can take the baby with you.</i>

348
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:49,721
What do you say?

349
00:26:57,247 --> 00:27:00,031
<i>(Judith crying)</i>

350
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:06,704
I don't know.
Maybe we'll keep the kid.

351
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:08,590
I'm starting to like this girl.

352
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,927
It's your last chance right now
to tell us you're coming out.

353
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,167
Are we done?

354
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:27,006
We'll hit the hinges.

355
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:29,108
<i>(silenced gunshots)</i>

356
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:34,136
Rick:
<i>Put your guns on the floor.</i>

357
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:36,338
Rick, we'll fire right into that office.
So you lower your gun--

358
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,391
- <i> (silenced gunshot)</i>
- Ah!

359
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:42,828
(whimpering)

360
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:50,902
Put your guns
on the floor and kneel.

361
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,773
Do what he says.

362
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,249
Martin, there's no choice here.

363
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,285
Yeah, there is.

364
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:10,539
Want to bet?

365
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:18,380
<i>(Gareth gasping)</i>

366
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:43,455
No point in begging, right?

367
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:47,709
No.

368
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,963
Still, you could have
killed us when you came in.

369
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,465
There had to be
a reason for that.

370
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,052
We didn't want
to waste the bullets.

371
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:04,175
We used to help people.

372
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,394
We saved people.

373
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,017
Things changed.
They came in and--

374
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,319
(groans)

375
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:22,527
After that...

376
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:31,536
I know that you've been out
there, but I can see it.

377
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:34,839
You don't know
what it is to be hungry.

378
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,429
You don't have to do this.

379
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:44,099
We can walk away.

380
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:47,052
And we will never
cross paths again.

381
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:48,770
I promise you.

382
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,557
But you'll cross someone's path.

383
00:29:57,147 --> 00:30:00,031
You'd do this to anyone,

384
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:02,367
right?

385
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,619
Besides,

386
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:08,073
I already made you a promise.

387
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,741
No!

388
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,300
(people screaming)

389
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,228
It could have been us.

390
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:21,363
Yeah.

391
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:54,179
This is the Lord's house.

392
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,266
No.

393
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:00,568
It's just four walls and a roof.

394
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:10,299
You'll always be with us.

395
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,637
Part of us.

396
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,529
Rick.

397
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:32,667
No, don't.

398
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:34,869
Let her stay.

399
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,204
I trust her.

400
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,261
I'm right outside.

401
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,218
I just want to say thank you.

402
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,854
For what?

403
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:56,223
Before the prison,

404
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:59,560
I didn't know if there were
any good people left.

405
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:04,398
I didn't know
if anybody was left.

406
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,122
You took me in.

407
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:15,476
'Cause you took people in.

408
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,081
It was you, man.

409
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:28,673
What I said yesterday,

410
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,641
I ain't revising it.

411
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:36,263
Even in light of current events.

412
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,569
Nightmares end.

413
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:46,440
They shouldn't end who you are.

414
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:54,782
And that is just
this dead man's opinion.

415
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:03,424
I'll take it.

416
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:09,046
(chuckles)

417
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,132
Just look at her

418
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,101
and tell me the world
isn't gonna change.

419
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:28,115
(raspy breathing)

420
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,159
You were out.

421
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,877
Hmm.

422
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,712
Was I?

423
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,664
<i>You were.</i>

424
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:50,538
Why are you smiling?

425
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,907
I think I was dreaming.

426
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,912
And I think you

427
00:34:57,914 --> 00:35:00,981
were smiling back
at me in the dream.

428
00:35:02,452 --> 00:35:04,885
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

429
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:13,994
So what is it?

430
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,700
The good that comes
out of this bad?

431
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,681
Bob?

432
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:40,821
Bob?

433
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:46,360
(sobbing)

434
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,266
Give it here.

435
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,616
You step out.

436
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:46,003
Okay?

437
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,627
<i>(door opens)</i>

438
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,598

(breathing heavily)

440
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,788
(squelches)

441
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:44,395
This is our route to DC.

442
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,180
We'll stick to it
as long as we're able.

443
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:49,683
If not, well, you got
our destination.

444
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,736
<i>Once Eugene gets to the
big brains left up there,</i>

445
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:54,521
<i>things are gonna bounce back.</i>

446
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,191
This group should
be there for it.

447
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:02,596
<i>You should be there for it.</i>

448
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,098
They will be.

449
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,033
We will.

450
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,737
We will.

451
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,176
Let's go.

452
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,401
<i>(shovel striking dirt)</i>

453
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:54,808
I never asked how it was for you

454
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,144
getting to Terminus.

455
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:09,456
It killed me.

456
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,676
No, it didn't.

457
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,526
<i>(door opens)</i>

458
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,537
I can't sleep.

459
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,717
And now, sitting in there...

460
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:14,221
Quiet.

461
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,281
It isn't just what
happened last night.

462
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,902
Saying what happened before...

463
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,624
out loud...

464
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,912
I see it all again.

465
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,883
I hear them.

466
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:44,418
Yeah.

467
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,254
That won't stop.

468
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:54,228
But it won't be all the time.
