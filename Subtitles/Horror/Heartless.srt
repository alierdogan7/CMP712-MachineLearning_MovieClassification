00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,439
Ηuh? What do you say?

172
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,559
What do you think of my suit, man?
You like it?

173
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,719
- Yeah.
- Cost me a fortune.

174
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,679
So if I don't get royally fucked tonight
l'm getting a refund! Κnow what l'm sayin'?

175
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,879
(Chuckles) Was that a laugh?

176
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,479
You got a nice smile, man.
You should use it more often.

177
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,119
(Rock ballad playing)

178
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,719
Come on, man.
You don't have to sit with these guys.

179
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,279
We'll have a nice little chat. Get us a couple
of cocktails, I know a good one.

180
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,279
This one is called a red rondo alla Faust.

181
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,399
OΚ.

182
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,719
(Both cough)

183
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
That's hot!

184
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,519
lt don't work unless it burns, man!
So go on, you were telling me about your dad.

185
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,919
I was a star,
like he told me when l was born right,

186
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,159
that he kissed my face
with so much love in his heart...

187
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,199
That's what left the mark, you know?
That's why it's heart-shaped.

188
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,079
Fuck me, it is shaped like a heart, man.

189
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,879
l love it!

190
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,319
You love it? You love it?
But you wouldn't want it though, would you?

191
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,559
- You know what Rilke used to say?
- No, who's that?

192
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,359
German poet. 1 875 to 1 926.

193
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,959
So, yes. l am educating myself, man.

194
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,239
Anyway, this dude Rilke...

195
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,679
- Ηe says that beauty...
- Yeah?

196
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,239
..is the beginning of terror.

197
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,079
No, it's not. No, it's fucking not.

198
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,479
If beauty's the beginning of terror,
then why are kids scared to even look at me?

199
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,959
l can't stand all this "Beauty's
only skin deep" crap. Because it's not.

200
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,919
l can't imagine what it would be like
to meet someone l like

201
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,159
and actually think that, like...

202
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,399
that they might be interested in me.

203
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,999
l'm never gonna feel like that.

204
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,519
I'll tell you what it feels like, right.
lt feels like l've got this parallel life...

205
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,159
l got this life that l'm living
where people look at me and call me names.

206
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,279
And then I got this other life,
where l'm just like you. l'm normal.

207
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,999
And in that life...

208
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,999
ln that life l meet, like,
a beautiful girl and then...

209
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,599
And we do the lot, you know,
we get married, have a nice house.

210
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,159
You know, have a...
have a kid.

211
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,599
A daughter, a beautiful baby girl.

212
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,119
l'd love that.

213
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,599
A chance to be a good dad.

214
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,719
You know, just like my dad was with me.

215
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,279
We pay them to clean the grave.

216
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,959
lt's all right, Mum. We'll get it clean.

217
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,119
That's better.

218
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,599
- (Gasps)
- What?

219
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,199
l've left my scarf with your dad.

220
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,119
You're joking.

221
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,919
- Look, l'll go and get it.
- You sure?

222
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,119
Yeah, l'll meet you back by the gate.
I won't be long.

223
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,039
(Cawing sound)

224
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,719
(Cawing)

225
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,439
(Screeching)

226
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,119
(Screech)

227
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,759
- What's wrong?
- Ηm?

228
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,039
You've hardly spoke since you got me scarf.
You all right?

229
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,559
- You sure?
- Yeah. No, l'm all right.

230
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,759
Listen to me, Jamie.
You are a beautiful young man.

231
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,199
Beautiful, kind and generous.

232
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,119
This has never been your problem.
You know that.

233
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,559
It's just the world, Mum...
l dunno, it just don't make sense to me.

234
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,999
You know, it's like l open up the window
and all this madness flies in.

235
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,799
And it's like l've never really known
how to live in it.

236
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,279
You do what we all do, Jamie.

237
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,719
We love.

238
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,359
And allow ourselves to be loved.

239
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,719
You need a family of your own.
Like your brother.

240
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,039
(Rustling)

241
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
- (Snarling)
- Oh, Jamie...

242
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,559
- (Snarling)
- l know what you are!

243
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,879
l know what you are!
What do you want from me?!

244
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,239
Oh, Jamie, please...

245
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,399
(Snarls)

246
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,119
Jamie!

247
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,239
- Jamie!
- Mum, no!

248
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,199
- Jamie!
- Mum! No, please!

249
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,919
- Let go of me! Let go of me! Mum!
- Jamie! Please!

250
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,519
No!

251
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,079
(Screaming)

252
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,399
No! No!

253
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,399
No!

254
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,399
Please! No!

255
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,599
Jamie... You're getting closer, old son.

256
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,999
(Muttering) Εvery time l close my eyes...
Ηe's coming for me.

257
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,479
lt's the drugs.

258
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,079
Can you stand up? Cos we can get out of here,
I can take you home.

259
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,319
l don't want to go home.

260
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,079
But Mum's killers, Ray. Mum's killers.

261
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,959
The police have got your statement.

262
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,599
The police won't do fuck all.

263
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,119
Come on, let's get you up.

264
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,999
The police don't know what this is, right?

265
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,639
They don't know what they're looking for.

266
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,439
l was there, mate.

267
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,439
l was there. l saw what did this.

268
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,559
l saw what did this.

269
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,719
l saw what killed Mum. l know what did this.

270
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,119
- (Lee) Dad?
- l know what did this.

271
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,079
Jamie, you're in shock. You need some rest.

272
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,879
I'm gonna find 'em,
l'm gonna fucking kill 'em!

273
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,159
We should think about finding you
somewhere else to live.

274
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,719
- Τhe memories of this place.
- The memories of this place are fine.

275
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,399
All right? lt's everything else
that's a fucking mess.

276
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,959
Tea...

277
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,759
Just get off my stuff, Lee, all right?
Just don't touch anything.

278
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,279
Why's everyone keep picking on me?

279
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,799
l've lost her too, you know!

280
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,679
l've lost her too...

281
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,439
(Youth) l'll tell you, mate.
She was fucking hot!

282
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,919
- Fucking hot!
- (Raymond) Κeep the bloody noise down!

283
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,959
(Youth) Fuck off, you old bastard!

284
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,279
(Raymond) Show some respect!
(Youth) Fuck off!

285
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,159
(Raymond) l'm not afraid of you!

286
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,399
Look at all Mum's jewellery.
lt's her mum's stuff and her mum's mum's.

287
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,359
Must be worth a small fortune.

288
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,439
(Sobs)

289
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,679
This is the world that we live in!
Makes me fucking mad, right!

290
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,879
They take innocent people,
torture them and then they film it. Why?

291
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,559
No, for fun! No other reason. Fun!

292
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,079
This is the world that we live in.
Drives me mad, man!

293
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,679
(ΤV interviewer) Are you saying
gangs have made stars out of terrorists?

294
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,439
(Sociologist) Yes.
Τerror is the new fashion accessory.

295
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,239
Τhere's a whole new generation out there

296
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,719
that's grown up watching beheadings
on the internet every night.

297
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,959
Τhey all wear the same clothes,
those black hoods, the masks.

298
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,239
- Τhey're not masks.
- These are the new foot soldiers...

299
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,239
in the family of gang culture.

300
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,599
Violence is their mother...

301
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,319
(Distant footsteps)

302
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,879
(lnterviewer) Τheir father?
(Sociologist) Chaos.

303
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,479
- AJ, you all right?
- Just a bit of trouble, man. Don't worry.

304
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,759
What happened? What happened?!

305
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,719
Oh, shit!

306
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,039
- (AJ groaning)
- All right, man. Lift up your T-shirt, yeah?

307
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,879
Jesus Christ!

308
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,599
AJ, we got to get you to a hospital, mate,
you need stitches.

309
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,719
No, no, no, man. Just pad me up,
give me lots of painkillers. That'll do.

310
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,239
lt's like an animal did it.

311
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,159
You said it, man.
A wild fucking monster.

312
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,119
(AJ) l just want to live a normal life.
I don't wanna fight.

313
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,479
So you meet me tonight, let's talk.

314
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,919
OΚ, l'll be there.

315
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,999
- Ηere you go, mate.
- Oh, cheers, man. Thanks.

316
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,919
Cool mobile, eh? Crocodile.

317
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,159
Crocodile.

318
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,999
Our link with the dinosaurs.

319
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,359
You religious, Jamie?

320
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,879
My mum was.

321
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,199
lt's all a load of bollocks, isn't it?
All of it.

322
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,679
Do you know what life really is, Jamie?

323
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,599
A meaningless pile of shitty chaos.

324
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,759
Accepting it - that's the real bravery.

325
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,879
To know that nothing means anything
and still wanna get out of fucking bed.

326
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,119
"God's will"!

327
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,839
There is no God.

328
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,479
lf there's no God
then there's no force of good

329
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,839
and that means that there can't be evil.

330
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,359
And there's definitely evil.

331
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,279
l mean...

332
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,039
There are demons.

333
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,399
Listen, AJ.
You know what's doing all of this, don't you?

334
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,879
l mean, you really know.

335
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,399
l've seen the future, Jamie.

336
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,639
And it's a kingdom of horror.

l've been knocking and knocking.
Where you been?

353
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,159
l just went out... Go to the shops.

354
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,039
Where is it then?

355
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,639
- What?
- Shopping.

356
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,559
What you doing here, anyway? l thought you
gone to Paris, Disney Land, with your dad.

357
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,919
Yeah, well, remedial dwarfs and a mouse
the size of an ape. Fucking nightmare.

358
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,879
- What, he let you come back on your own?
- l'm 1 7, not seven.

359
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,239
Uncle Jamie... You know that gold heart
l got Gran for her birthday?

360
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,679
l never got it engraved.
And now it's on my fucking brain.

361
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,759
Stupid, innit? But l wanna do it now.
For Gran, you know?

362
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,519
Where is it? ln her room?

363
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,679
Oi. Don't go in there!

364
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,799
That's private.

365
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,759
Your dad put all your gran's jewellery
in the safe, back at work.

366
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,879
At work? l never heard him mention that.

367
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,799
Yeah, well, perhaps he had other things
on his mind, Lee, eh?

368
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,959
Well, you know the combination
to the safe, don't you?

369
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,439
Look, l can't talk about this now, all right?
l'm not in the mood.

370
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,719
l wanna engrave it for Gran, Jamie.

371
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,919
It's doing my head in!
Can't you understand that?

372
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,839
(Raymond on machine)
Hey, bruv. Hope you're OK. Listen...

373
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,319
there's been a blow-up with Lee.
He's gone back.

374
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,079
And my credit card's gone missing.

375
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,319
l think the silly sod's got himself mixed up
in some gang stuff...

376
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,719
Typical! My own fucking dad's against me!

377
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,439
No one wants to help.

378
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,199
Why is that? Εh? No one wants to lift
a little fucking finger to help!

379
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,719
Look, Lee. Lee...

380
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,079
- Fuck off!
- Lee!

381
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,199
(ΤV) A father and his ten-year-old son made
a gruesome discovery here yesterday morning,

382
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,799
when they found a human arm
in a place where children sometimes play.

383
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,719
According to police, the wounds
on the severed limb are so savage

384
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,839
it's as if a wild animal did it.

385
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,799
Various other body parts
have been found further along the river,

386
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,399
but with the head still missing
the police are requesting

387
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,639
- if anyone recognises this crocodile tattoo
- AJ...

388
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,239
..found on the victim's left upper arm,
they should contact the police immediately...

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,199
(ΤV) A photograph has been released
of the suspected gang leader,

391
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,719
Shevannal Maze,
known in the criminal underworld as "She".

392
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,159
22-year-old She damaged his right hand...

393
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,839
- AJ.
- ..while making a bomb at the age of 1 4

394
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,559
and is now reported to wear
a baroque-bladed weapon...

395
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,599
(Ringing)

396
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,799
(Man) Hello, Jamie.

397
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,319
Who is this?

398
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,639
You know where this is, don't you?

399
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,039
Cendrillon Ηouse?

400
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,999
l'm waiting for you. Also...

401
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,279
..remember what your dad used to say.

402
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,039
"We only regret the things we don't do."

403
00:36:46,680 --> 00:37:02,839

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,879
(Phone chirps)

411
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,799
Ηello, Jamie. Come in.

412
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,639
Ηe's expecting you.

413
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,519
Papa B...

414
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,079
The world...

415
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,639
don't make sense to you does it, old son?

416
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,319
No.

417
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,479
What if I can show you
the world does make sense?

418
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,879
Sit, Jamie. Sit.

419
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,079
Question. When is man most alive?

420
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,399
When is man most creative?

421
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,839
l will explain.

422
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,799
Belle...

423
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,479
Close your eyes. Relax.

424
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,479
ls man most creative
in a time of peace and calm?

425
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,279
l don't think so.

426
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,159
Give mankind nothing but calm and order,

427
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,159
and mankind's nothing but a zombie,
a grazing cow.

428
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,919
Man needs the unpredictable
to feel truly alive.

429
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,399
To progress. To create.

430
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,639
Mother Nature knows this.
That's why she gives us cyclones, tsunamis.

431
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,039
Sometimes, just sometimes,
Mother Nature, she can't do it all.

432
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,719
So what happens then?

433
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,999
l help.

434
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,039
(Echoing screams and gunfire)

435
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,519
(Screams and gunfire get louder)

436
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,159
Εnough!

437
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,759
Don't! Stop! Stop it!

438
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,919
Say someone comes to me and they want
money, or fame, a second chance.

439
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,999
l say, "l will give you that.
Just give me a splinter of chaos in return."

440
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,799
lt can be big or small.

441
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,879
Dribbling bleach on a baby
or flying planes into nuclear reactors.

442
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,839
Mankind needs atrocity like this.

443
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,239
Think about it, old son.

444
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,639
What triggers have always
shot mankind forward?

445
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,239
Violence.

446
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,999
That's the engine of progress.

447
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,279
Τhat's what blasts man
into the orbit of a new age

448
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
and the more random and horrific the better.

449
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,799
Jack the Ripper heralded
the coming of the twentieth century,

450
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,279
not Florence fucking Nightingale.

451
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,079
lt's atrocity that marks the birth
of a new era.

452
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,599
Gas chambers...Ηiroshima...9/1 1 ...

453
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,959
And l, in my humble way,
contribute to the process.

454
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,119
l'm like...the patron saint
of random violence.

455
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,919
The demons?

456
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,559
All mine.

457
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,479
And my mum? My mum?!

458
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,199
No! Jamie, don't!

459
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,319
(Yells)

460
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,079
Feel better, Jamie?

461
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,119
Belle?

462
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,479
Come on, Jamie. Come on.

463
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,839
lt's all right.

464
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,919
I'm sorry about your mother
but her death was necessary.

465
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,839
- Why?
- To make you ready, old son.

466
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,879
To bring you to me.

467
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,079
l've been watching you, Jamie.

468
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,439
l thought you might be ready
for making a deal.

469
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,479
A deal?

470
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,759
What's your wish, Jamie?

471
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,439
(Growls)

472
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,399
You can have anything.
You can have what you've always wanted.

473
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,239
l'll get rid of this.

474
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,199
l'll make you...beautiful.

475
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,359
Fuck you! Fuck you!

476
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,959
Jamie, stop!

477
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,879
- l don't want anything to do with him.
- Your mum. It's what she wanted.

478
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,519
Remember what she said.

479
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,399
She wanted you to find someone to love.

480
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,359
Ηave a family.

481
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,199
Like your brother.

482
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,439
lt'll be OΚ.

483
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,519
- So what would l have to do?
- Chaos, Jamie. You contribute.

484
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,199
You help my world evolve.

485
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,319
Yeah? Well how, exactly?

486
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,159
- Graffiti.
- What? Graffiti?

487
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,479
Really, Papa?

488
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,679
Yeah, why not?

489
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,399
Make it easy on the boy.
That sound all right, does it, Jamie?

490
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,639
Once every few months you
just scrawl on a wall, "God is a stupid fuck!"

491
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,119
- What, and that's it?
- That's it.

492
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,879
So we have a deal.

493
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,479
Yeah.

494
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,559
Belle...the cocktail cabinet.

495
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,959
Ηow many, Papa?

496
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,439
Just the one.

497
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,119
What's this?

498
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,399
The lighter, Belle.

499
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,679
- What am l supposed to do with this?
- Light it, old son.

500
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,519
The fire will burn away the old.

501
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,799
You'll arise anew.

502
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,879
lt won't hurt for long, Jamie.
l promise.

503
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,239
Let it go, old son.

504
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,599
Let it go, Jamie.

505
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,039
Let the fire burn away the old.

506
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,079
Arise anew.

507
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,799
Think Phoenix!

508
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,119
(Screams)

509
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,199
(Slurps)

510
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,119
(Gasps)

511
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,039
(Κnocking)

512
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,399
- (Belle) Can l come in, Jamie?
- Yeah, come in.

513
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,279
Some new clothes for you.

514
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,079
Thank you.

515
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,879
Papa B says you're to wait for Weapons Man.

516
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,919
- Weapons Man?
- Yeah.

517
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,119
Ηe'll help you with your part of the deal.

518
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,599
Don't worry.
Some people wait over 60 years for him.

519
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,839
Ηey, what's wrong? You OΚ?

520
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,759
Yeah, l'm fine.
You should go before Papa B gets back.

521
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,559
Ηe gets angry sometimes.

522
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,319
(Εlectrical humming)

523
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,759
(Youth) Oi, look who it is.
lt's the elephant man.

524
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,039
Come here!

525
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,239
- Come here!
- Ah, he's hiding!

526
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,999
(Continue shouting)

527
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,919
- What!
- What?

528
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,039
What you laughing at?
What are you laughing at?

529
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,759
Ηello? Ηello?

530
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,719
ls it Temple Buildings?

531
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,119
Yeah. No, it is.

532
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,759
- Εrm, 27?
- Yeah, just that one there.

533
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,559
Oh, thanks,
l've been walking up and down for ages...

534
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,439
Delivery! Please be in.

535
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,559
ls that for AJ?

536
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,639
Andy Jeffries. Sounds like an AJ to me.

537
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,479
Yeah, it's just l know he's gone away,
so he's not in.

538
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,199
- Can l ask you a favour?
- Yeah.

539
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,119
Could you sign for this?

540
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,479
Well, l don't think l should.

541
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,559
OΚ.

542
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,759
Are you sure you're all right?
You don't want to sit down?

543
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,679
No, l'll get fired.

544
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,439
All right. OΚ.

545
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,959
Whoa, whoa. Let me take that.
All right, let me take that.

546
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,639
Are you sure you don't want
to just sit down for five minutes?

547
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,959
l'll get you a glass of water.

548
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,599
- There you go.
- Τhanks.

549
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,479
l have a feeling...

550
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,319
That we've met before?

551
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,399
- Yes.
- Yes. No, no, we have.

552
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,679
We did. When l met you l had a... l had a...

553
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,919
Well, it's actually quite difficult
to explain.

554
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,039
Ah, perhaps don't explain.

555
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,559
The past - we'll wipe it clean.

556
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,639
My name is Tia.

557
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,759
l'm Jamie.

558
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,279
- What is this?
- What's that?

559
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,559
- lt's a magical tree.
- No, it's Victoria Park actually.

560
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,679
lt's beautiful.

561
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,839
That's me sitting there. My dad took that.

562
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,119
You were cute!

563
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,719
Yeah, well, l think he might have got
my good side.

564
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,439
- Your dad was a professional photographer?
- Yeah, he was. Yeah.

565
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,919
l'm interested in photography too.

566
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,359
- You're kidding, are you?
- Yes. l never go anywhere without this.

567
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,799
lt's not very good.

568
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,279
No, no, it's great.
At least it's a film camera.

569
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,159
Of course. Digital!

570
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,799
Digital!
Oh, man, digital is like a rough sketch.

571
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,199
You know, whereas film's... Film's like...

572
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,159
Caravaggio...

573
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,679
Εxactly!

574
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,599
Ηere, look. Let me show you something.

575
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,719
This... This is the first camera
my Dad bought me.

576
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,839
You can see l'm holding it
in that picture there.

577
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,839
Τhis is without doubt, right,
without doubt my favourite camera.

578
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,599
You know, if you want, we could go out
and I could show you how to use it.

579
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,679
OΚ.

580
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,919
Tia, look...

581
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,159
Look, we have met before.
But I was different then.

582
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,079
You know, l used to have this birthmark
right across the side of my face.

583
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,559
l can't explain what happened.
But it just went.

584
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,319
Just disappeared, you know.

585
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,399
lt was like magic.

586
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,759
Look. l can show you, look.
lt's right on this picture here.

587
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,159
Look, if you look all down the left side
of my face you can see it there, Tia. Tia...

588
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,679
Tia?

589
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,879
Tia! Tia, please!

590
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,639
Look, l know it feels
like we're moving too fast,

591
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,719
but you just have to trust me, please.

592
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,759
Please.

593
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,159
Look, my Dad said, "You only regret
the things that you don't do."

594
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,799
So don't walk away.

595
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,879
You could phone work, you know.
You could chuck in your job,

596
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,599
you could throw all the rules
and all the things you're supposed to do

597
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,639
and just chuck them out the window.

598
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,399
l just... l just wanna spend a day with you.

599
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,759
This is the tree here, see? Look at that.

600
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,039
Look, remember what l told you, right?

601
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,759
You just gotta turn...turn the lens
at the front there, to get it in focus.

602
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,879
- lt looks different.
- What? Less magical?

603
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,319
- Yeah!
- You just gotta change the angle.

604
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,839
Look, come here.

605
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,719
Just change the angle.
Come down low, like that.

606
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,119
Try it now.

607
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,319
lt works.

608
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,119
Εverything can look magical if you just...

609
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,199
lf you just look at it the right way.

610
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,399
Εxactly. Ηere.

611
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,879
Go on, look at the camera.
Go on, look at it.

612
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,119
Big smile.

613
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,079
Perfect.

614
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,359
(Tia) l like it here. Like heaven.

615
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,359
(Jamie) Yeah, it is.

616
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,199
My dad, he used to love this place.

617
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,559
You know, we'd just come out here
and we'd just take photographs and just talk.

618
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,599
You know, my dad was
one of them people that just...

619
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,239
Just made sense of the world.

620
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,879
And he'd come up with
all these great stories, that...

621
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,439
l dunno, you know?
Just, they made sense to me.

622
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,039
l'd do anything to go back to that day.

623
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,479
Just for like, a minute...

624
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,799
A second, even.

625
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,999
Look, l'll tell you what l'll do,
l'll take them to the studio

626
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,559
and l'll get some prints developed.

627
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,439
You know, l'd like to do that.

628
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,359
Then we can remember the day.

629
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,799
Well, thank you, Tia. l had a good day.

630
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,239
Tia, will l see you again, though?

631
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,559
Tia, can l see you tomorrow?

632
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,639
Come on, at seven o'clock?

633
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,079
Tia, will you come to the flat?
Come on, please, say yes!

634
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,279
Yes.

635
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,959
(Laughing) Yes!

636
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,799
(Κnocking)

637
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,279
(Laughs)

638
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,199
Mr Morgan?

639
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,399
- Yeah...
- You're expecting me, l believe.

640
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,239
Weapons Man?

641
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,879
Oh, right.

642
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,439
- May I come in?
- Yeah. Yeah, please.

643
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,879
Very nice.

644
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,439
l detect a woman's touch.

645
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,519
Yucca.

646
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,439
Very stylish.

647
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,399
(Sniffs) Oh... My wife would like that.
She's got me to redecorate our bathroom.

648
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,039
She wants it done out in gold taps
and marble floor.

649
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,519
Fake gold and marble, needless to say.
Still cost a fucking arm and a leg, though.

650
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,239
Not to my taste.

651
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,839
Looks like the fucking Palace of Versailles,
you want my opinion.

652
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,119
She soaks herself morning, noon and night
in lavender and bergamot bubble bath.

653
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,759
She says, "l feel like Marie Antoinette."
l say, "Well you know what happened to her."

654
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,319
She don't. She will. l've made plans.

655
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,759
There's a kid l know who's a dab hand
with a chainsaw. lt's a beautiful weapon.

656
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,239
Talking of weapons... Business.

657
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:27,239
Sorry, yeah, it's just, Belle said it could
take up to 60 years for you to come visit.

658
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,559
Yeah. lt could.

659
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,999
lt didn't.

660
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,599
All this technology makes life so much easier.
Years ago it was all pens and paper and...

661
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,759
Oh! Ηere we go!

662
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,479
Sit down.

663
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,479
Now, just a few formalities.
lt's boring l know, but bear with me.

664
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,279
So your name is Jamie Morgan.

665
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,679
- Yes.
- Any middle name?

666
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,479
- No.
- Address?

667
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,439
l know that, l'm here, ain't l?

668
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,599
- Age?
- Εr, 25.

669
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,719
ln your prime, l see. No peeking!

670
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,039
Now, my job is to make sure
the element of chaos you contribute

671
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,359
doesn't clash with any other
elements of chaos in your area.

672
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,879
lt also helps keep your particular
contribution unique and distinctive.

673
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,999
One brutal murder. Just one.

674
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,639
- Ηow's that sound?
- No, no, l'm, er, doing graffiti.

675
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,799
- That's the deal you did with Papa B, is it?
- Yeah.

676
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,399
What, and you believed him, did ya?

677
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,759
- What?
- (Laughing)

678
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,399
One born every minute. Priceless.

679
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,279
Graffiti!

680
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,039
You saying that he lied?

681
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,559
Of course he fucking lied!

682
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,359
That's not exactly fair now, is it!

683
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,959
Of course it ain't fucking fair!
Who said life is fucking fair?

684
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,959
Life is cruel and unjust
and we wiggle like worms on the hook of...

685
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,759
Oh, who gives a fuck!

686
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:53,119
Let's just cut the crap and move on, shall we?
l repeat - one brutal murder.

687
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,719
That is very reasonable.

688
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,239
Now, let's find out the victim's profile.

689
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,719
Well, very good. Young male.

690
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,399
Lets find out when the murder should happen.

691
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,719
Mm. When the moon is next full. Very classy.

692
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,719
Sorry, is there any chance
we could talk to Papa B about that?

693
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,239
No. Method of dispatch...

694
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,879
Oh... Yeah, this is bloody good.
Or should l say good and bloody?

695
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,719
"Ηeart to be cut out while the victim
is still alive

696
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:24,399
"and said heart to be placed on steps of
church, any church, your choice, by midnight."

697
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,119
By the last chime, you got that?

698
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,479
One second, one millisecond later
and that won't do, Mr Morgan. You got that?

699
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,119
l don't understand.
l don't actually think l can hurt anybody.

700
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,999
Priceless again. Anyone can hurt anyone,
Mr Morgan. Ηaven't you learnt that?

701
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,039
Now, to my favourite bit.

702
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,079
Finding the weapon.

703
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,319
Years ago, this was all l did. Ηence the name.

704
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,719
But since Jack the Ripper
things have got a little bit more, well...

705
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,919
inventive, shall we say.

706
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,599
Oh... We're lucky.

707
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,359
The weapon's in the flat.

708
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,399
What?

709
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,399
Oh... Oh, hold up!

710
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,679
(Laughs) Oh...

711
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,799
Oh! lt's in here.

712
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,959
Getting warmer.

713
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,039
Oh, hotter...

714
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,679
What have we got here?

715
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,319
No! That's my dad's coat! That's my dad's
stuff from when he went travelling.

716
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,559
Will you let me do my job, please!

717
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,999
Thank you.

718
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,119
- (Breathes heavily)
- (Bones crack)

719
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,559
Weapon found.

720
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,679
No, my dad loved that.

721
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,079
lt was from his first ever trip. Please...

722
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,319
And it's been waiting for you ever since.

723
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,999
So, that's it.

724
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,759
One heart to be cut out
when the moon is still full

725
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,599
and placed on the steps of a church
before the final stroke of midnight.

726
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,519
lt's a pleasure doing business with you,
Mr Morgan.

727
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,239
No, l won't do it.

728
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,759
l'm serious, all right? l won't do it!

729
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,359
This isn't the deal that l made!
Τhis isn't fair!

730
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,359
Look, come on, it's not fair!
You can't expect me to actually kill somebody!

731
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,439
Look, please... Can you just
speak to Papa B for me? Please.

732
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,559
Ηello, sir.

733
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,479
Yeah, fine, sir. lt's just there's...

734
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,319
There's a little last-minute reluctance
from the client.

735
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,119
Thank you, sir. Much appreciated.

736
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,679
What's going on? What did he say?

737
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,199
Just a moment, please.

738
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,599
Ah! No! No! No!

739
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,119
(Grunts and coughs)

740
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,439
Ah! Make it stop! Please!

741
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,239
- Not much fun, is it?
- Please! Make it stop!

742
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,999
(Coughing)

743
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,079
- Please...
- You gonna do it?

744
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:01,079
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! l'll do it!
l'll do it! Please!

745
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,439
We got there in the end, Mr Morgan.

746
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,439
(Jamie gasping) l'll do it...

747
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,279
Oh, by the way...
Guess when the moon is next full.

748
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,759
Tonight.

749
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,279
You got till midnight.

750
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,759
(Sobbing)

751
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,279
Belle...

752
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,359
l tried to help but...he got mad.

753
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,719
Come on, Belle...

754
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,519
lt's OΚ.

755
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,599
Ηe'll kill us both if you don't do it.

756
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,559
l don't know how to kill.

757
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,439
l don't know how to...

758
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,199
First, find your prey.

759
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,679
What you doing? l didn't do anything.
l paid money to get in there.

760
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,039
(Bouncer) Fuck off!

761
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,759
(Music playing in nightclub)

762
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,559
(Drunken shouting)

763
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,079
Fucking cheapskate!
You don't know what you're missing.

764
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,519
l'm fuckin' perfection!

765
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,119
Jeeko sex machine! That's me!

766
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,959
Jamie...

767
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,359
Go on...

768
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,239
Go! Go!

769
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,559
- Ηello, handsome.
- All right.

770
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,599
- I just wanted to...
- Like what you see, do you?

771
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,199
Course you do.
You know perfection when you see it.

772
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,359
Look at that six pack. Wanna touch?

773
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,159
lt'll cost you.

774
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,919
- Ηow much?
- Depends on where you touch, mate.

775
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:18,119
And how long you touch it for. And what you
touch it with, if you catch my drift.

776
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,319
- Location's important, too.
- What?

777
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,679
Well, is it a down-the-alley touch here,
or an indoors touch?

778
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,359
lndoors, Jamie! Your place.

779
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,079
lndoors. lndoors, good idea.

780
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,959
Εrm, indoors, we'll do it at my place.

781
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,159
lndoors costs more
and l get my taxi fare there and back

782
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,719
and the price of a kebab and a Diet Coke.

783
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,999
For you, in total, 1 50 quid,

784
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,759
if we get it all done in an hour.

785
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,199
An hour? All right, that's good.
We've only got an hour.

786
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,519
Well, perfect.

787
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,639
Ooh... Very nice.

788
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,319
You own it, do you?

789
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,479
Worth a fortune now, these places.

790
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,239
Oh... You never thought you'd be lucky enough
to get someone like me, did you?

791
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,879
People don't. I've had grown men
weep at the thought of touching my feet.

792
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,199
Yuccas... Εugh!

793
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,759
"Ηope in the Lord,
the bleeding heart of Jesus."

794
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,319
Can you just put that down?
Please, just put that down.

795
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,159
Don't back out, Jamie.

796
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,759
- l won't.
- Oh, come on, don't get all guilt-ridden.

797
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,959
- Εh?
- Don't say, "l won't." Say, "l will!"

798
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,559
You mustn't be afraid. OΚ?

799
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,519
You've just gotta go for it.

800
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,319
So, what do you want?

801
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,599
Look, l want you to just stop
touching everything.

802
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,679
Please, it's just personal.

803
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,879
Be brave.

804
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,559
Whatever it is, that's what l'm here for.

805
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,399
So... Say it!

806
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,479
Come on!

807
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,439
You've now only got 40 minutes.

808
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,159
You need him to keep still.

809
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,919
l just need you to keep still, please.

810
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,479
Oh, l get it. Passive beauty, eh?

811
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,919
What is it? Ηandcuffs?

812
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,599
(Whimpering) Oh, don't-don't-don't hurt me!

813
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,559
Tie-Tie me...

814
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,839
(Laughs)

815
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,519
Can you get off the chair?

816
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,079
Come on. Describe how you want me.

817
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,359
Ηuh? Εxactly...

818
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,039
Silent and still.

819
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,999
Silent. l need you still.

820
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,319
- And silent.
- Now l'm with you, sunshine.

821
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,359
The old mummified game.

822
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,479
Surprising how popular that is these days.

823
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,839
I wouldn't have thought it
from a first timer but, hey-ho.

824
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,839
Why not jump in at the deep end, eh?

825
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,279
We'll have to improvise.

826
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,079
- Clingfilm!
- What?

827
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,599
lt'll work if there's enough.
Just leave a gap for my eyes and nose.

828
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,559
l like to see what's going on.

829
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,159
And not too long -
the skin needs air, you know?

830
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,119
Oh, and if l make this noise -

831
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,599
"Mmmmm!"

832
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:43,119
That's the signal to stop...
whatever you're doing.

833
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,519
- Understood?
- Yeah, understood.

834
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,999
35 minutes!

835
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,199
(Siren blaring outside)

836
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,799
Mmm! Gonna have a good time.

837
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,839
(Jeeko) Mm-mm-mm!

838
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,759
(Jeeko laughing)

839
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,119
(Laughing)

840
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,439
- Mm?
- Forgive me...

841
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,479
(Panicked grunting)

842
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,759
(Heavy bang)

843
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,079
You'll never do it in there.
Take him to the kitchen.

844
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,199
(Grunting)

845
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,439
(Jamie roars)

846
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,279
(Screams in agony)

847
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,679
(Jeeko groaning)

848
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,039
- (Screaming)
- (Ηeartbeats)

849
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,759
- (Ticking)
- Run!

850
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,559
(Clock strikes)

851
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,639
(Clock strikes twelve)

852
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,639

978

It is precious to me, Jamie.
l won't sleep tonight with worry.

979
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,079
Please...

980
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,319
You can kill her there.

Say yes.

When l first met you, l didn't think

And l did.

Oh, come on, what do you know?
Do you know what happened...

991
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,239
Just open the safe, Jamie. Please.

992
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,079
- Why did you say "after this"?
- Look at the time! Kill her!

993
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,999

1040

She said he'd kill you all, one by one.

1041
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,559
Burn you alive...

1042
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:57,599

1043
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,399

1044
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,199

Go! Go! You have to get out!

1052
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,639
l'm not leaving you!

1053
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,479
They're not interested in you, OΚ?
It's me that they want.

1054
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,279
You can be happy somewhere else!

1055
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,399
- Dad...
- Just go, Belle, please. Just go!

1056
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,559
No! l won't ever be happy without you.
Not ever!

1057
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:08,279
We all lose people, you understand?
OK? But we have to let them go.

1058
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,479
We have to.

01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,079
l love you, Dad.

1060
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,559
lf you love me, then you'll let me go.

1061
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,479
Go on, let me go. Yeah?

1062
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,119
(Demons screeching)

1063
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,519
I had this birthmark,
right across the side of my face.

1064
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,159
Just disappeared, you know?

1065
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,679
lt was like magic.

1066
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,439
You're beautiful.

1067
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,639

(Roars)

1078
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,399
(Man) Well, these kids, this gang, they came
out from nowhere. Sounded like wild animals.

1079
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,959
They were throwing
these burning things at them.

1080
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,839
And the man and his kid just went up
like that! The screams... Jesus!

1081
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,799
(Reporter)
Sir, did you see the faces of the gang?

1082
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,559
No, no. Τhey were wearing these masks,
these demon masks.

1083
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:50,399
- They weren't masks!
- Τhere, it's got kids petrified!

1084
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,999
l'm not afraid of you any more.

1085
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,079
No?

1086
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,119
No.

1087
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,519
Don't work unless you're scared...

1088
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,759
old son.

1089
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,479
(Birdsong)

1090
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,599
You're gonna fucking die!

1091
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,559
(Dad) Jamie...

1092
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,119
Jamie!

1093
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,719
Κeep still.

1094
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,559
Oh, that'll be a lovely photo.

1095
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,719
Ηave that framed. Put it in the front room.

1096
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,919
Would you like that? Εh?

1097
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,039
- (Boy) That boy's face!
- Come on.

1098
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,479
Ηave I ever told you about
the night l slept in a forest?

1099
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,279
l was only a little bit older than you.

1100
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,679
l'd gone there with Dad to take some photos.

1101
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:09,319
l'd never been out of the city,
not at night, l hadn't.

1102
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,559
So we made this little camp, yeah?

1103
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,959
And that night l looked up...

1104
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,039
Cor... Stars!

1105
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,999
l'd never seen so many.

1106
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,719
Sky was blazing with them.

1107
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,719
Dad explained,
you need real dark to see stars.

1108
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,439
Because in the city there's
too many street lamps and stuff, see, so...

1109
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:39,839
But when things are really dark,

1110
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,999
as dark as they can get,

1111
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,519
you see so much more,
so many wonderful things.

1112
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,839
Sometimes, old son...

1113
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,119
things are gonna get darker for you
than they do for the rest of us.

1114
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,079
But you've got to...

1115
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,159
You got to see those moments
as something special.

1116
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,799
Because they're showing you things.

1117
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,319
A way of looking at the world
that no one else will ever, ever understand.

1118
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,959
That's a blessing, Jamie.

1119
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,119
That's not a curse...

1120
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,199
Does that make sense?

1121
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,959
l love you, Dad.

1122
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:25,519
l love you, Jamie.

1123
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,199
l'll always love you.

1124
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,319
lt'll never go.

1125
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,399
Come on, old son, let's get you home.

1126
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,879
Your mum will be waiting for us.

1127
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:59,599
Oh, Dad...

1128
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,519

1129
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,559
