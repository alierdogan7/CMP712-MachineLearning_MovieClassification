00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:36,621
Babe? Fire's starting
to go down.

2
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,957
Would you please go get
some more firewood?

3
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,584
Come on. I'm tired.

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,130
Come on. Please?
It's starting to get cold. Aw.

5
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,757
I'm getting cold. Oh, hey!
Come on.

6
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,430
Hey, just remember I have the keys,
and I'll leave without ya.

7
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:56,433
Hey, okay. All right.
I'll get some wood.

8
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:58,518
Yeah, I'll get some.
Great.

9
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:30,550
Mmm. Thanks for bringing back
the wood, babe.

10
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,512

11
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,819
<i>jj'</i>

12
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:47,867
You know, this last guy
wanted the ultimate.

13
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,370
You should have seen what his
idea of “the ultimate” was.

14
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:55,041
I mean, I thought
I've seen them all,

15
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:59,587
but this guy had something
that was a new one even on me.

16
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,964
<i>Oh.</i>

17
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:05,510
So, um, how you doin' tonight, kid?
You look a little down.

18
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,223
I need one more trick
to make my rent.

19
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,683
Hmm. I know how that is.

20
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,852
Oh, here's somebody.

21
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,980
<i>Hey.</i>

22
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,066
You wanna go out?

23
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:26,697
How much?
Twenty-five's regular.

24
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,908
Fifty's French and regular.

25
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,040
For 75, I'll take you
around the world.

26
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,252
Hey, uh, don't forget
“the ultimate.” Yeah.

27
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:40,920
How much is that?

28
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,590
For a hundred bucks,
I'll give you the ultimate, baby.

29
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,926
Let's go.
You're on.

30
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,053
See you later.
All right.

31
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,149
<i>A L it is' cold outside.</i>

32
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,151
<i>Get lost, deadbeat!</i>

33
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,361
<i>It's cold outside, Al!
So? Bundle up.</i>

34
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,325
<i>People who don't pay their bills, they
take it on the arches. Shove it!</i>

35
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,786
Get lost.

36
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,080
Yes, can I help you?

37
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,500
Give me my favorite room, AI.
You got it.

38
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,090
Okay, that's 25 for the room.

39
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:35,892
If you'd like a color TV, Mr. Packard,
another five bucks.

40
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,647
And 35 with the tax.

41
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,482
All right.

42
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,403
Okay.

43
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,575
You joining us
for continental breakfast?

44
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,538
What can I do for you, sweetheart?
How corny, AI.

45
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,519
Put the money on the dresser,
sweetie,

46
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,939
<i>and I'll catch up with you.</i>

47
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,987
You ever model?

48
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,534
Yeah, sure.

49
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,039
Show me.

50
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,670
Like what?

51
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,006
Like in the magazines.

52
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,226
Like this?

53
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,437
Yeah.

54
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,489
Or like this?

55
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,744
Yeah.

56
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,755
Like this?

57
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,507
Mm-hmm.

58
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,639
Like this?

59
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:40,933
Hot stuff.

60
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:45,646
Come on, honey.
The meter's tickin'.

61
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,983
I got money.

62
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,068
Lots of money.

63
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,781
Want me to model for you
some more?

64
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,118
No.

65
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,314
Leave your clothes on.

66
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,027
Okay.

67
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,032
Anything you want.
I want you to have a good time.

68
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,359
I can%.

69
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,701
Relax.

70
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,791
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

71
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,043
Right?

72
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,171
Right. Right.

73
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,140
Uh!

74
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,642
You like that, honey?
No.

75
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,562
I love it.

Oh, you're so good.

79
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,959
You know, I like this
with my clothes on.

80
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,211
Yeah.

81
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,840
You're good!

82
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,884
Ooh!

83
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,011
Yeah. Hey-

84

You bitch!
What-

85
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,433
What are you doing?

86
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,730
Stop it!
What are you doing?

87
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,776
Stop it!

88
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,823
Stop it! Aah!

89
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,746
Please, baby!

90
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,630

94

Why didn't you stop me?

95
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:19,003
Mommy. I didn't wanna do it.

96
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,090
I didn't wanna do it.

97
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,884
Mommy. I didn't wanna do it.

98
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,355
Why'd you make me do that?

99
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,692
I didn't wanna do it.

100
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,033
I didn't wanna do that.

Christmas shopping, Mr. Zito?

102
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,913
Yes, Terry.

103
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,537
Miss me?

104
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,845
You're gonna like it here.

105
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,198
Oh, yes.

106
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,208
I told you not to go out tonight,
didn't I?

107
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,836
Every time you go out,
this kind of thing happens.

108
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,299
This has got to stop. it's silly.

109
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,677
And it's not getting us anywhere

110
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,139
You think they don't know?
They do.

111
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,476
I heard it, and I know.

112
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,853
They all know,

113
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:08,607
and I don't like it any more.

114
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,568
But you don't listen, do you?

115
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,571
It's got to stop.

116
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,782
You'll like it here.

117
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,910
Oh, you're right about them.
All of them.

118
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,995
They're all the same.

119
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,581
I know what they're like.

120
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,876
Just because I can't do
the things you do...

121
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,631
doesn't mean I don't see it
all the same.

122
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,510
Fancy-schmancy.

123
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,513
And what are we supposed to do?

124
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,559
Sit and smile and, “Yes, miss,”
“No, miss,” “Not now, miss”?

125
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,644
“Whatever you say, miss”?

126
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,356
I know. I know how it is with their airs
and their looks and their-

127
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,901
They can drive a man crazy!

128
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,779
I di- I didn't mean that.

129
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,991
I didn't mean it that way.

130
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,743
It's just that they-

131
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,246
they don't know when to stop.

132
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,249
They never know when to stop.

133
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,127
That's why they have to be stopped.

134
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,715
It is. You're right. You're right.
But not like that.

135
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,009
Not that way.

136
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,011
Please.

137
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,347
They'll take you away from me.

138
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,349
You have to be careful.

139
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,894
You have to listen to me.

140
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,897
We can't live like this.

141
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,107
I have to go out.

142
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,611
And each time, it's like this.

143
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,614
I get so scared
that they'll take you away.

144
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,784
But they won't...

145
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,870
if you do what I say.

146
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,873
They won't take you away.
Not ever.

147
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,376
Not ever, I swear.
Not ever.

00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,600
<i>Right now, we are live
over midtown Manhattan.</i>

183
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:55,063
<i>bringing you the latest update on one of the most
violent killing sprees in our city's history.</i>

184
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:59,067
Following yesterday's brutal slaying of a
young couple under the Verrazano Bridge,

185
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,863
New York City Police Commissioner Paul Delaney
has assigned a special task force...

186
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:09,911
<i>of over two dozen detectives to join in on the manhunt for
a madman who has left five dead in the metropolitan area.</i>

187
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,539
<i>The peculiar yet brutal
disfigurement of the bodies...</i>

188
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:16,751
<i>has led police to believe that one man
is responsible for the killings.</i>

189
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,338
<i>50 ﬂair, witnesses are few,
and detectives are stumped for clues.</i>

190
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,341
<i>Back in local politics,
Assemblyman Anthony Ventura-</i>

191
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,280
You tell me what I should do.

192
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,658
I heard about it.

193
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,410
I always do.

194
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,122
I can't go out for a minute.

195
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,709
it's impossible.

196
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,845
Fancy girls...

197
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,931
and their fancy dresses
and their lipstick...

198
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,519
laughing and dancing.

199
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,606
But you stop them, don't you?

200
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,233
I can't stop 'em.

201
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,527
But you do, don't you?

202
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,330
Then they can't laugh,
and they can't dance any more.

203
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,417
So you got to stop,

204
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,337
or they'll take you away from me.

205
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,640
I won't ever...

206
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,729
let them take you away from me.

207
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,154
You're mine now forever-

208
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:15,286
and I'm so happy.

209
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,745
And, uh, I got on TV.

210
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,750
Denise, be careful.

211
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,378
<i>Don't swing so high.
Okay I won't.</i>

212
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,630
All of my friends
were so surprised.

213
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,134
Denise,
you wanna ride our bikes?

214
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,594
My mother said
I can't leave the park.

215
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:16,347
Oh, come on.
Come on.

216
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,057
Okay.

217
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,916
Be careful, little girl.

218
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:13,357
Pat, are you sure Jerry and I
can't give you a ride home?

219
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,360
Oh, no, thanks, Kath.
Ken'll be here in a second.

220
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,363
And if not,
I'll splurge and take a taxi.

221
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:22,366
Well, here's the newspaper, if you
wanna read it while you're waiting.

222
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,369
Are you sure you don't need it?
I wanna check my horoscope.

223
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:28,372
No, I already read it
this afternoon on my break.

224
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:33,586
Oh, I hate reading the newspapers these days
with that kook running around. Yuck.

225
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:38,215
I know. That guy's really a sicko.
I hope they catch him soon.

226
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:42,637
Yeah- Oh, be sure and check Mr. Gannon's I.V.
on your shift tomorrow.

227
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,473
He, uh, pulled it out
again tonight.

228
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,558
Not again.
He's too much!

229
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,936
I will. I'm so cold.

230
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,896
Here's Jerry.
Okay.

231
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,360
- You sure I can't give you a lift?
- No, thanks.

232
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,487
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

233
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,863
Night!

234
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,743
Hi.

235
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,013
Open!

236
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:16,392
Open up!

237
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,694
Oh! Oh!

238
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,011
This is what you like, baby,
isn't it?

239
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,763
This is what you like, isn't it?

240
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,389
Yeah, this is what you like.

241
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:33,018
It's nice, isn't it?

242
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,543
<i>Now, now, now. It'll be all right.</i>

243
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:01,630
<i>Look, it's just a little inconvenient.</i>

244
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,216
<i>I know how upsetting it is.</i>

245
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:08,470
<i>But it's just a little blood.</i>

246
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:10,556
<i>It'll wash out.</i>

247
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:14,434
<i>Look, you have to be more careful.</i>

248
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:16,853
<i>Yes.</i>

249
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,855
Huh.

250
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:27,614
You're getting very careless-
blood in your hair.

251
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,408
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

252
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:31,535
What will people say?

253
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,789
What will we do?

254
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,917
You want to look pretty, don't you?

255
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,919
Pretty for me?

256
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,556
You're so pretty.

257
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,064
J';

258
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,448
J';

259
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,875
<i>Oh.</i>

260
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:31,803
<i>Hold on. I'm coming.</i>

261
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,851
<i>Who is it?
Yes, uh, my name is Frank Zito.</i>

262
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,937
<i>You took my picture in the park.
May I speak with you?</i>

263
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,815
Come in.

264
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,984
That's- That's amazing.

265
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,362
I was just looking at a photo
I took of you in the park.

266
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:52,324
Really? Well, uh, it's a coincidence, because
what I wanted to, uh, speak to you about-

267
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,951
Do you mind if I take a look?
Certainly.

268
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,130
<i>Oh, great.</i>

269
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,174
Here you are.
Thanks.

270
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:11,885
Listen, um-

271
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,471
Listen, how come
all your models are women?

272
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,808
Well, it's just something
I'm interested in as a woman.

273
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,020
In fact, this is my fourth series.
It's called Woman Four.

274
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,189
Mm-hmm.
Not very original, is it?

275
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,358
Well, it's not the title
that matters that much.

276
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,527
No. No.

277
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,821
Listen, do you get to, uh,
keep them all?

278
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:32,614
I'm hoping to sell them.

279
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:36,410
I wouldn't. I-I'd keep 'em forever.

280
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,412
But Why?

281
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:41,456
I mean, part of my profession
is to sell photographs.

282
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,418
It's not all for art's sake, you know.

283
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,963
I know, but why do you take pictures
of women this way?

284
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,217
I like to make them look beautiful.

285
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,261
No. I think it's more
to preserve them.

286
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,847
You see, the beauty
is already in the model.

287
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,099
Frank, don't be silly.

288
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,685
Listen, I'm the photographer, right?
Right.

289
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,771
So I should know
what I'm doing, shouldn't I?

290
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:09,192
I know, but to me, you know,
things change, people die.

291
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:12,529
But in a painting or a picture,
they're yours forever.

292
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,200
There's no way you can
possess someone forever,

293
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,286
even in a photograph.

294
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,079
There's no way.

295
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:25,584
Well, I was noticing this picture
of this old lady here.

296
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,546
At one point in her life,
she was someone's sister,

297
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,132
someone's wife, someone's mother.

298
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,343
And when the photographer took her picture,
he had her the way he wanted her.

299
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,387
She could never leave him.

300
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,600
She couldn't grow old,
and she couldn't die.

301
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,852
Tell me, Frank.
What do you do for a living?

302
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,396
Um, I'm a painter.
Yeah?

303
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,816
Abstracts, some still lifes, some landscapes.
You know, things like that.

304
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,527
I'd love to see some of your work
sometime.

305
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,446
You would?
I'd love to, yes.

306
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,657
Listen, uh, Anna,

307
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,659
I know this place over
in New Jersey, you know?

308
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:02,078
Yeah?
Clams Casino.

309
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,955
Italian food.
Mm-hmm.

310
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,540
And, uh-

311
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,709
Would you like to have dinner?

312
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,878
Why, Frank,
are you asking me for a date?

313
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:13,965
<i>You talkin' to me?
I'm talking to you.</i>

314
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,134
I'd love to, yes.
I really would.

315
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:19,095
- Give me five minutes, and I'll be right with you.
- Great.

316
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,410
<i>jj</i>

317
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:48,416
jj, You're the
most beautiful woman I've seen since, uh, my mom.

318
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,295
Thank you.
You're welcome.

319
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:55,882
Thanks.

320
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,385
Have you got a picture of her?
Yeah.

321
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:04,891
Mmm.

322
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,644
Here. it's when she was younger.
Oh, right.

323
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,523
Tell me, where does she live?

324
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,860
Oh, we lived in Queens, but, uh,
my mother was taken from me...

325
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,737
in an automobile accident
when I was younger.

326
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,531
I'm sorry.

327
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:22,117
She really was lovely.
Mm-hmm.

328
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,202
Mmm, it's a shame.

329
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:27,873
Listen, Frank.
What?

330
00:53:27,956 --> 00:53:30,458
Rita's coming to the loft
tonight at 9:00,

331
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,586
and I want to get
all the work finished.

332
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:35,672
So she promised me
she'd work overtime.

333
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,800
So, in other words, it's an early night.
Is that it?

334
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:40,927
It is really.

335
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,179
Well, as long as I can
see you again, I mean-

336
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:45,223
Yes, of course.
Great.

337
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:47,601
What about tomorrow night?

338
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:50,020
Tomorrow night?
Let's see if I'm booked.

339
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,022
No, of course tomorrow night
would be great.

340
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:56,276
But I know you're very busy, and I'm
sure that, uh, something will come up.

341
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,695
I might be and, then again,
I might not be.

342
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:04,367
Oh, but I'll definitely see you
on Thursday at the show.

343
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,202
No kidding.
You'll be there.

344
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:08,330
Yes, and so will
five million other guys.

345
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:11,249
Oh, Frank.
What?

346
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:13,335
Are you annoyed?
No.

347
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:16,046
I mean, that would be ridiculous,
wouldn't it?

348
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:17,631
Yes, it would.

349
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:21,801
Mr. Steiner's doing this-
He's having this really big celebration.

350

Your hair is different.
Yeah.

But now we're
back together again.

And I'll never let you go.
Never.

463

Now, you were wrong
to try to hurt me.

You left me alone

I was scared.
Real scared.

466

I hid in the closet.
Did you know that?

467
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:17,516
No, you didn't know that.

468
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:22,021
I was afraid
that you wouldn't come back.

But I won't cry now.

You did come back.

And now you're mine,
all mine.

475
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:50,716
Why did you need those other men?
They didn't love you.

476

I did. I loved you.
I needed you.

477
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:58,391
There were so many men.

478
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:08,109
I never wanted to hurt you.

479
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:24,542
I never wanted to hurt you.

480
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,836
Never.

481
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:30,339

482
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:36,679
There was- So many men.

483
01:07:39,682 --> 01:07:42,435
Why?

484
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:44,687
Because they gave you some dollars?

485
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,901
But they didn't love you.

486
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:53,529
I loved you.

487
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,032
Only me.

I'm not going to kill you.

492
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,632
I'm going to keep you...

You know, when Mommy tells you to...
hide in the closet,

506
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:37,693
you have to do what Mommy tells you...

507
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,905

01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,487
Thank you for sending the-
the ﬂowers for the funeral parlor and-

519
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,823
and for attending the funeral.

520
01:14:10,906 --> 01:14:15,160
Rita didn't have many friends,
and I really appreciated it.

521
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:17,246
It's okay.

522
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:20,082
Look, I was wondering if we could
stop by the cemetery.

523
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,251
I want to pay my respects
to my mother.

524
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:26,672
I usually drop off a wreath- I have it
in the back seat- at Christmas time.

525
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:28,674
Would that be all right,
before we go to dinner?

526
01:14:28,799 --> 01:14:30,467
Of course.
Fabulous.

527
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:32,928
Mmm.
Thanks

528
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,789
Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
Amen.

529
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,626
Hail Many, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

530
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,129
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

531
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:10,549
Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen

532
01:15:12,718 --> 01:15:14,428
Hail Many, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

533
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:19,057
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy-

534
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:23,020
<i>-</i> Oh, my head
<i>-</i> Frank.

535
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:24,980
Oh, my head hurts.
Frank, what's the matter?

536
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:27,065
What's the matter?
It hurts.

537
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:29,443
My head hurts.
Don't. Please.

538
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:32,654
It was a long time ago, Frank.
Rita knew.

539
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:35,824
What do you mean?

540
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:37,868
Rita knew.
What do you mean?

541
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:41,830
She's mine forever.
What are you talking about, Frank?

542
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,208
Rita knew! Rita knew!
Frank!

543
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,126
This is me! Anna!
Rita knew!

544
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:49,463
Frank! Frank!

545
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:51,673
Rita knew!

546
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,063
Mother!

547
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:38,113

Oh, Mommy.

Mommy.

566
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:05,742
No!

567
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,892
<i>You betrayed me.</i>

Mommy.

575

Like this?

576
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:04,170
And this.
