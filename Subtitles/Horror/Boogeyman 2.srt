01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:47,446
I was--I was
always so scared.

886
01:17:47,446 --> 01:17:49,326
But the Boogeyman...

887
01:17:55,485 --> 01:17:57,405
I looked
into his eyes...

888
01:18:00,245 --> 01:18:03,045
and saw that he's
afraid of nothing.

889
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,325
But you killed them.

892
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:13,044
He forced them
to face their fear.

- Henry.
- You thought the Boogeyman...

894
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:17,764
...was your greatest fear.
You're wrong.

895
01:18:17,764 --> 01:18:20,364
- He'll show you your true fear.
- Henry!

I hurt you much more
than I helped you.

I'm sorry for that.

You suffered
a psychotic break.

But you did help me.

Dr. Allen's
records indicate

918
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:56,548
that your brother
was released

919
01:22:56,548 --> 01:22:58,788
several days ago
in positive mental health.

did you find her?

I told you,
we searched twice.

we didn't find any survivors.
