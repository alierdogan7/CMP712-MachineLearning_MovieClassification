this a very special day for me.

365
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:48,546
A beautiful and big
collaboration begins.

366
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,648
[dog barks]

367
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,890
So... good studio?

368
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:55,897
- Yes, it's all right.

369
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:58,366
- Bigger than your studio?

370
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,801
- Gilderoy's studio
is just a garden shed.

371
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,066
- Only two in at a time.

372
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:05,801
- The mixing room here
is very special.

373
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:10,369
- Well, the Mallard needs
a service, but otherwise...

374
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:12,380
- What needs servicing?

375
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:15,975
- The Mallard high-pass filter.

376
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:17,246
- Really?

377
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:19,447
You know, when you meet someone
for the first time,

378
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,217
just try and discuss
only positive things.

379
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:23,384
It's good manners.

380
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:25,188
<i>- How was I?</i>

381
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:27,593
<i>- The less said the better.</i>

382
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:29,927
<i>You hardly sound
like you're seconds away</i>

383
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,991
<i>from being penetrated
by a red-hot poker.</i>

384
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:36,994
<i>- I didn't know how intense
you want it.</i>

385
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,473
<i>- Well, I think
the general consensus</i>

386
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:41,476
<i>is that a red-hot poker
in a woman's vagina</i>

387
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,035
<i>is an intense experience.</i>

388
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,241
<i>- But an intensity
that reaches the other side.</i>

389
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,942
<i>You understand what I'm saying?</i>

390
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,145
<i>Maybe now you will find
the inspiration</i>

391
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:51,778
<i>for your performance.</i>

392
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,310
<i>- Let's hope so.</i>

393

[dog whimpering]

394
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:57,587
- What's going on?

395
00:24:57,626 --> 00:24:59,093
- Just another scene
where Veronica

396
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:00,595
cannot use her imagination.

397
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:01,596
- Speaking of scenes,

398
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,029
I was gonna ask you what...

399
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:04,054
about the film.

400
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:05,362
- Hey, what do you mean?

401
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,267
- Like, just to know a bit
about what happens.

402
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,101
- No, Santini is busy—
- It's okay. It's okay.

403
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:11,128
Francesco.

404
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:13,801
This is a very specific vision.

405
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:16,311
But you must help me,
Gilderoy.

406
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:20,577
It's something I want you
to respect.

407
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,982
- No, it's not that.
It's just...

408
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,679
I've never worked
on a horror film before.

409
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,312
- Horror film?

410
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,959
This is not a horror film.

411
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:33,962
This is not a horror film.

412
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:35,986
This is a Santini film.

413
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,568
True, a Santini film
is violence, I know.

414
00:25:41,603 --> 00:25:42,729
<i>But this is the life.</i>

415
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,068
This is the life.

416
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:46,301
This is part
of the human condition.

417
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,072
Please, please, Gilderoy.

418
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,410
Don't call my film "horror"
again.

419
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:53,505
- Slip of the tongue.

420
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:55,573
- Don't worry.
It's okay.

421
00:25:55,617 --> 00:25:57,107

- Just celebrate
whatever comes to your mind.

428
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:14,927
That's what usually happens
in this studio.

429
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,665
- Let's make toast!

430
