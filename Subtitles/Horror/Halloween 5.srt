1
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,095
Die ...

2
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,322
you ... son of a bitch!

3
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,870
Jamie ...

4
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:26,164
I want you to stay in the car.

5
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:38,135
Jamie!

6
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:40,347
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

7
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:43,722
That's him.

8
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,015
Don't hit the girl.

9
00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:47,423
Get down!

10
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:06,176
I don't get it, what happened?

11
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:10,776
He's gotta be down there!

12
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:26,351
Do it!

13
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:27,765
Stand back!

14
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:31,037
Quiet, Tuki.

15
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,197
Be quiet!

16
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,717
There's nothing out there, Tuki.

17
00:05:59,317 --> 00:05:59,957
No.

18
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:05,557
No!

19
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,557
Come on, Jamie.
Your bath is ready.

20
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:25,637
No!

21
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,517
Jamie! No!

22
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,397
It's all right.

23
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,317
It's all right, darling.

24
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,437
Oh, Jamie.

25
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:43,877
Jamie ...

26
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,277
Jamie!

27
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:48,397
It's just another one of your nightmares, that's all!

28
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:50,397
Oh ...
Oh.

29
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,837
Oh, darling. Look at me, look at me.

30
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,797
Do you want me to call your mom?

31
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:56,437
Oh!

32
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:59,957
Oh, Jamie.
Jamie.

33
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,877
I'll call the doctor.

34
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:10,397
Oh, Jamie!

35
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,117
Oh, Jamie!

36
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,797
Jamie!
Doctor!

37
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,317
Get a gurney!

38
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:19,957
Somebody!

39
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:21,917
Come on!
- Okay.

40
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:22,797
Yeah. It's ready.

41
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,397
Go! ... Go!
- Jamie ...

42
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:27,357
... breathe!

43
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:28,957
Breathe, Jamie!

44
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:30,597
Jamie, breathe.

45
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:33,957
Prep e.r.! Tracheotomy. Go!
- No!

46
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,357
Hang on, Jamie. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

47
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:39,117
All right, down.
- There you go.

48
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,637
Easy, easy, easy, doc.

49
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:43,997
You got her up there?
- Yeah. Steady, steady.

50
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:51,197
She needs oxygen!

51
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:53,637
All right, unstrap her.

52
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:57,517
All right.

53
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:09,197
No!

54
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:10,917
No!
- What are you doing?

55
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,317
Leave her!
- This girl is dying!

56
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:18,397
I have to open her trachea, for God's sake!
- She will stabilize.
- She's dying!

57
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,517
No.

58
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:28,877
Do you see?

59
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,037
I see you still want this girl dead.

60
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,397
She has something to tell us.

61
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,837
Hey there, funny face.

62
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:09,797
What?

63
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:14,557
Thank you.

64
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:21,237
Hey! Hey, open up!

65
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:22,797
Max!

66
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,197
Max!

67
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,877
They don't allow Max in here.
- Get in there, Max.

68
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:29,837
You know.

69
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:32,117
You know what they can do if they can't take a joke.

70
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:33,997
She doesn't even remember.

71
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:36,597
Is she really better?

72
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:40,317
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,677
Give me some of this action, baby.

74
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,477
What?

75
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:53,957
I wonder what Rachel's hiding
behind door number three.

76
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:09,197
It looks so good. It'll be so cute.

77
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,157
Billy ...

78
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:15,237
... is going to have to fight off a lot of boys.
- Billy is gonna freak.

79
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:18,117
What is going on here?

80
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:25,917
Gee. I'm sorry.

81
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,357
Come on, Max. Here.

82
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,117
Bye, sweetie, love you.

83
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:37,237
I'll be back in two days ... okay?

84
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,637
Mom and dad send their love.

85
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:08,797
How could they?

86
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:12,437
When are they gonna realize that she is not him?
She's just a child.

87
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,237
They know that Michael Myers is her uncle.

88
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,997
And that she attacked her stepmother.
That's why they fear her.

89
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:21,157
Especially on Halloween.

90
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:24,117
I never should've let my parents talk me into leaving.

91
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:25,877
I don't know, what I was thinking.

92
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,277
You are afraid and ..
- I am not.

93
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:32,517
You're afraid the whole thing might start ...
to happen again.

94
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:36,037
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

95
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:39,637
And I suppose there's nothing wrong
with just leaving my little stepsister here alone.

96
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,797
You can telephone her from the cabin.

97
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:44,477
She'll be properly looked after.

98
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,797
Then why do I still feel guilty?

99
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,677
I'm worried about Jamie.
- So, stick around.

100
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:55,717
I already promised my parents.
- Promises were made to be broken, babe. - I don't know.

101
00:12:55,837 --> 00:13:00,757
The farm's parties always rock. Think about it.
- Okay. -  I gotta jet. Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:03,557
I'll be back with the outfits.
- See you, Tina.

103
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:05,157
Max!

104
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:08,077
Max, what is it?

105
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,557
Come on, Max.

106
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,037
Oh, come on.

107
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:38,397
Come on, Max!

108
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,037
Come on.

109
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:42,157
Yes.

110
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,717
Here. You want this?
- That's mine.

111
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,197
I want the green one.
- I used to like this. - Here is the red one.

112
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:11,277
I don't want the scissors.
- It's mine.

113
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,197
I got the hook on them.

114
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,197
Shut up, Max!

115
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:30,757
It's a joke.

116
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,837
Jamie?
- Max!

117
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:41,997
Max?

118
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,397
What'd she say?
- Okay.

119
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:47,917
All right!

120
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,117
Hold on a minute!

121
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,157
All right!

122
00:14:58,237 --> 00:14:59,437
I'm coming!

123
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:01,077
Hello?

124
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:03,157
Are you all right?

125
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,117
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was just in the shower.

126
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,677
Is ... is Max all right?

127
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:11,117
Max is having fun.
He's been barking at a cat all morning.

128
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:12,237
Go and check him.

129
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:15,077
Well, why?
- Go and check him, now!

130
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:17,077
All right.

131
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,957
All right. Hold on.
I have to go downstairs.

132
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,277
Oh, brother.

133
00:15:58,997 --> 00:15:59,877
Rachel?

134
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:04,077
<i>Dr. Loomis ...</i>

135
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,037
Max is gone.

136
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:08,757
Listen to me.

137
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:13,197
<i>Drop the phone, go to the nearest store.
Get out of the house.
Quickly! Now. Go on!</i>

138
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:24,637
Mr. Cornet!

139
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:37,637
Better find that out.

140
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,997
All clear. Nothing above, nothing below.

141
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:44,117
What about Max?

142
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,917
A dobie, right?

143
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,797
This is not happening to me.
Max!

144
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,317
Max, what have you done?

145
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,757
I'm so embarrassed.
- That's what we're here for.

146
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:57,837
Rescue cats. - Find dogs.
- That's our job. - And we love it.

147
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:02,477
Think so.

148
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,717
<i>Bye, sweetie.
I love you.</i>

149
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,357
<i>You be a good girl.</i>

150
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:08,477
<i>Bye.</i>

151
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:17,277
So, she was perfectly all right.

152
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:21,397
Come on, Billy.

153
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,757
I think Jamie needs to get some rest.

154
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:28,597
Jamie, are y-you okay?

155
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:31,077
Come on.

156
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,877
You sense something, don't you?

157
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:54,477
Tell me.

158
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:57,157
Tell me what you know!

159
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,477
Here, write. Write! Write!

160
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:03,917
Write, what you know.

161
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:06,757
Jamie, please!

162
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:09,877
Please.

163
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:41,557
Yeah.

164
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,357
Max?

165
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,277
Max?

166
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:06,037
No!

167
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:16,077
The tetanea should've taken effect by now.
Another dose might stop her heart.

168
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:19,637
She was shaking!

169
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:21,957
Her whole body was shaking!

170
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,477
Every time a little girl twitches,
I'm supposed to call out the National Guard.

171
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,037
How many people did he kill last year?
Have you forgotten?

172
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:33,677
Your own daughter. - I don't.
- No! Of course you don't forget!

173
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:35,597
How could you?

174
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:37,597
But you never looked into his face, did you?

175
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,437
You never saw his eyes.

176
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:40,997
You never saw that ...

177
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:42,317
... nothing ...

178
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:43,957
No expression.

179
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,237
Blank.

180
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:48,157
My memory goes back 12 years ...

181
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:49,877
to the night when I offered ...

182
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,797
I'm gonna show you.

183
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,077
Show you something.
Look, look. Look at this.

184
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:56,597
Look at that.

185
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,797
I prayed ...

186
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:02,957
That he would burn ... in hell.

187
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,157
But in my heart ...

188
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:08,997
I knew that hell would not have him.

189
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:10,517
Sheriff?

190
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:15,997
They want you down at the cemetery.

191
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:29,517
Rache?

192
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:32,437
Rache?

193
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:42,317
Maxie!

194
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:46,797
Chill out, Max.

195
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:50,117
I'll get your water in a second.

196
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:54,517
Rache?

197
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:57,957
Rachel?

198
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,117
Rachel? Rachel?

199
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:05,637
Rachel. I got you a present.

200
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,197
Rachel!

201
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:15,317
Rachel?

202
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:23,477
Rachel!

203
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:33,877
Rachel?

204
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:46,037
Gonna miss you, baby!

205
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:37,757
Sammy!

206
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:57,237
It's Halloween, right?
- Can you believe we have this whole house
to ourselves for the weekend?

207
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:00,037
But Tina, that's what you've said before, remember?

208
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:03,077
Oh, Sammy, are all your circuits on hold or what?

209
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:10,037
Tina, I thought Rachel was lurking around.

210
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,357
Oh, I did too ...

211
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:14,717
But I guess she decided to go up to the
country with her parents.

212
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,837
Oh, Max!
Shut your canine trap!

213
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,917
What if my mom calls and finds out ...

214
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:22,477
... Rachel's not here with us, huh?

215
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:24,997
Just joking!

216
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,917
Sammy, why don't you bag spitz tonight?

217
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,597
I couldn't do that.- Oh, sure you could.
- Oh, no, I can't.

218
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:58,277
Come on. Ooh, you're blushing.

219
00:24:59,037 --> 00:24:59,997
Come on.

220
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:02,237
Come on. You can't hide anything from me.

221
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,357
Come on.
- This may be it.

222
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:07,557
"It"?

223
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:09,837
What are you saying?

224
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:13,237
I can't talk to you about this.
- Oh, come on.

225
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:16,757
Come on. I mean, you're planning something.
What are we talking here like ...

226
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:17,957
candles and ...

227
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:19,157
... and a ...

228
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:22,677
sensual massage and ...

229
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:24,557
leopard sheets.

230
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:25,957
Satin.

231
00:25:26,637 --> 00:25:28,997
Satin sheets?
- They're Rachel's!

232
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,157
I just flipped my skirt!

233
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,237
What do you want me to do?
What can I do? What can I do? I mean ...

234
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:38,037
Do you wanna make up signals or something?
- Enough!

235
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:41,957
What? Come on.
You guys can have the house to yourselves.

236
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:43,357
It's cool.

237
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,197
Mikey and I like it in the car.

238
00:25:50,077 --> 00:25:52,957
Oh, honey. Don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried.

239
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:56,077
I've just been in
a weird mood all day.

240
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:58,837
Everybody in this town is in a weird mood.

241
00:25:59,237 --> 00:26:01,517
They should ban Halloween in this town.

242
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,877
Michael!

243
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,237
What?!

244
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:18,877
Hi.

245
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:22,837
Hey, you're just in time to give us a ride.

246
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:27,917
Come on, Sammy.
He's sorry about last weekend.

247
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,317
Aren't you, Mikey?

248
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:31,317
No.

249
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:33,757
See?

250
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:36,277
Tina, I thought you wanted to see Jamie.

251
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:38,277
Look, you're killing me, babe.

252
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,397
Would you just get in?

253
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:42,197
We can go later, right Mikey?

254
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,077
Right?

255
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:40,437
It's all right.

256
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:42,157
It's all right.

257
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:47,717
What are you doing down here?

258
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:52,557
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
- There you are.

259
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:54,957
We've been looking all over for you.

260
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:55,957
Come to me, baby.

261
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:56,957
Come on.

262
00:28:58,557 --> 00:28:59,517
What happened?

263
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,997
Was it one of your dreams again?

264
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:03,997
Okay, come on.

265
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,197
You gotta help me, Jamie.

266
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,877
You gotta help me to find him.

267
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:14,037
We both know he's alive.

268
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:16,637
But you know where he is!

269
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:18,517
Why?

270
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:21,317
Why are you protecting him?

271
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:23,837
Why?

272
00:29:25,317 --> 00:29:27,717
What about your stepmother, Jamie?

273
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:30,997
You love her, don't you?
He made you stab her.

274
00:29:34,837 --> 00:29:38,117
You cannot hide from him.
He'll always get to you.

275
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,877
Jamie.
Jamie, listen.

276
00:29:42,837 --> 00:29:44,917
Today in the cemetery ...

277
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,997
... somebody dug up a coffin.

278
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:52,277
It was a coffin of a nine-year-old girl.

279
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:56,917
What do you think he's going to do with that?!

280
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:02,197
You're nine years old ...

281
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,357
... aren't you, Jamie?

282
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:05,917
Dr. Loomis ...

283
00:30:06,077 --> 00:30:08,037
Leave the little girl alone.

284
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,037
Tears won't get you anywhere.

285
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:18,557
Help me to find him.

286
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,477
We'll find him together!

287
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:27,077
There's a reason, why he has this power over you.

288
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,277
Did you ever wonder what it is?

289
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:35,077
Baby?

290
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:49,517
He's still inside.

291
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,877
Okay.
- Excuse me.

292
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:55,517
Where is the bus stop for Chicago?
- Let's see, are you going to the Blooming Hill?

293
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:47,557
Michael?

294
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,397
Have you come home ...

295
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:04,837
... Michael?

296
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:09,397
I know what you want from her.

297
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,197
Don't you like the mask just a little bit?

298
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:41,757
Yeah, maybe you don't even need to wear a mask, baby.

299
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,477
* Baby, I'm yours *

300
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:52,277
* Baby, I'm ready *

301
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,397
Bruised, but ready.

302
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:55,997
Hi.

303
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,797
Friends of yours?

304
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,517
So, how many cases can we get?
- Three cases.

305
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:20,437
Any more, I think old Mr. Casey
would know something's up.

306
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,957
But we gotta get going.
Shift changes pretty soon.

307
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,837
You gonna pull around back
or should we both get busted out front here?

308
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:31,197
Oh, Mike.

309
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,997
Nice wax job.

310
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:36,357
You touch the car again and you're dead.

311
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:37,357
Okay?

312
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:38,237
Okay.

313
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:39,477
Thank you.

314
00:35:41,317 --> 00:35:43,437
You're gonna get high blood pressure, Mikey.

315
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,077
Pick me up at 8:00 at Rachel's, okay?

316
00:35:45,157 --> 00:35:47,477
We gotta get ready for the tower farm party.

317
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:48,677
Hey Mikey ...

318
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:50,477
wanna go have your legs waxed?

319
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:09,357
All right, that's it. Now, go, go, go.
And don't drink it all before we get there, okay?

320
00:36:15,077 --> 00:36:16,077
Idiot.

321
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,557
What the ...

322
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:44,437
Okay, asshole.

323
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,237
You wanna play?!

324
00:36:48,877 --> 00:36:50,317
Trick or treat!

325
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:10,037
Three, two, one.

326
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:11,477
Can you hear me up here?

327
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:14,037
Testing: one, two, three.

328
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:22,477
Ooh, my.
Aren't you pretty?

329
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:29,557
These are ...
for you.

330
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:36,077
Aren't they beautiful?

331
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,637
We'll have to put them in water.

332
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:45,757
... yeah.
- It's great.

333
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:51,757
It ...

334
00:37:51,997 --> 00:37:54,357
It's ... good luck.

335
00:38:00,797 --> 00:38:03,517
First of all I'd like to thank you parents for supporting ...

336
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:08,077
... us tonight. Now, what we've all been waiting for
our annual Halloween ...

337
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:13,757
... costume pageant! Our first couple is Jenny Hogel
and Christian McGint. Give them a big hand.

338
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:59,837
Next is Tony Larkin and Diane Lewis.
- Jamie, come on.

339
00:39:03,957 --> 00:39:04,997
Tina!

340
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:07,477
Queen of room service.

341
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:15,837
Michael, open the door.

342
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:18,237
Mike!

343
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:24,997
Michael, it's cold out here!
Come on, open the door!

344
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:27,677
Mikey.

345
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:30,957
Mikey.

346
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:36,197
Thank you for being such a gentleman.

347
00:39:37,117 --> 00:39:40,397
And now we have Billy Hill and Jamie Groder.

348
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,997
You're wearing my present.

349
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:49,157
I want you to know ...

350
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:52,877
I just love barbaric men.

351
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:58,997
Jamie as a princess. Give her a big hand.
- Jamie.

352
00:39:59,157 --> 00:39:59,917
Jamie.

353
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:01,717
Jamie, come on.

354
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:04,237
Michael, don't I even get a kiss?

355
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:16,277
Well, I can't resist your new look.

356
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:19,557
Jamie, come on.

357
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:29,717
It feels creepy.

358
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:41,757
I think. I think she's gonna fall down!

359
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:43,757
Jamie.

360
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:49,477
Jamie!

361
00:40:51,997 --> 00:40:52,837
Jamie!

362
00:40:58,477 --> 00:40:59,637
Just great.

363
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,677
The old silent treatment, huh, Mike?

364
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:03,957
What'd I do wrong this time, huh?

365
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:06,957
Is it because I wanna see Jamie?

366
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:14,077
Nothing, Mike. That's what I get. Nothing!

367
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,197
Stop here. I want a pack of cigarettes.

368
00:41:20,557 --> 00:41:24,397
I said, stop the goddamn car!
I want a pack of cigarettes!

369
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,437
Come on.

370
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:42,077
Great.

371
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:44,437
Psycho boyfriend.

372
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:51,717
Jamie.

373
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:56,637
Tina. Is she in danger? Where is she?
- No. We gotta get her arm.
- Where is she?

374
00:41:56,877 --> 00:41:59,197
Tina. Where is she, Jamie?

375
00:42:05,637 --> 00:42:06,397
Jamie.

376
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,077
You've got to help us!

377
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:10,397
Get Meeker on the line.

378
00:42:10,997 --> 00:42:12,557
Sergeant Meeker, what's your 20?
- St ... ore!

379
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:17,357
Store!

380
00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:19,517
Store?

381
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:23,717
What kind of store?
What do they sell there?

382
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:26,437
Nie ... er.

383
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:31,197
Lighter.
- No!

384
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:36,037
What do they? What do they sell?
- Big ...

385
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:41,437
Wo ... - Woman.
- A big woman? A big woman who works?

386
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,717
Works in the store?
- No!

387
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:47,277
What? Jamie, what?

388
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:52,597
Cookie woman!
- Cookie wo ... woman.

389
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:54,557
Cookie woman?

390
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:56,517
Cookie woman.

391
00:42:56,597 --> 00:42:58,637
Dale's gas station. Fifth and maine.

392
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:24,357
Tina Williams!

393
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,957
If you are Tna Williams, stay where you are!

394
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:33,237
Check the inside!

395
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:38,237
<i>She appears unharmed.
- What the hell's going on!? I'm fine!</i>

396
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,397
Please, you gotta come with us to the clinic.

397
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:42,797
Is Jamie all right?

398
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:44,037
Just get in the car.

399
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:49,637
We're bringing her in.

400
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,637
Unit 22. A-positive ...

401
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:55,917
I don't believe this.
- Come on.

402
00:44:03,717 --> 00:44:04,677
Tina!

403
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:07,597
Where's Jamie? Is something wrong?

404
00:44:11,117 --> 00:44:12,437
Tina!

405
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:25,757
Say it again!

406
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:28,437
T- T - Tina.

407
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,557
I love it!

408
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:36,477
Tina, don't go.
- I have to.

409
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:38,517
Why?
- Because!

410
00:44:38,797 --> 00:44:40,517
You might not understand, but ...

411
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:45,037
When you're older, there are people you're gonna meet
who make you feel ...

412
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:46,557
like, connected.

413
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:49,037
Like your heart is made of neon, and ...

414
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:51,597
When you find them, you have to be with them.

415
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:55,317
But he was with you.
- Who?

416
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:59,197
The boogeyman.
- Oh, yeah. That's one way of describing him.

417
00:45:00,237 --> 00:45:01,917
Tina. No!

418
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:05,797
Honey, I will come back later tonight
and I will sleep with you right here.

419
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:07,677
Tina!

420
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:10,117
I'll be back.
I love you.

421
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:13,317
Tina!

422
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:20,797
All right, buddy, let's hit the ... - All right you sto ...
- Why don't you stay the night?
- I'm sorry. I gotta run.

423
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:26,357
Tina, please. - Stay away, okay? You know.
You're really creepy filling that little girl
with all that boogeyman crap.

424
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:27,877
I believe that you're in danger.

425
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:29,277
Jamie believes it too.

426
00:45:29,397 --> 00:45:32,437
Jamie's a nine-year-old girl.
- Be sensible!

427
00:45:33,837 --> 00:45:36,237
I'm never sensible if I can help it!

428
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:37,437
Tina!

429
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:38,757
I got these over here.

430
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:40,917
For God's sakes, stop her!

431
00:45:43,317 --> 00:45:45,717
On whose orders?
- She hasn't done anything wrong.

432
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:48,637
Follow her, then!

433
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,477
At least you can do that!

434
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:52,157
If that girl ...

435
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:56,197
... dies tonight ...
- All right, all right. For you, doc, anything.

436
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,637
You guys supposed to be trailing me or something?

437
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:12,357
Well, then you can give me a ride to the Tower Farm.

438
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:40,757
Tina.
Gotta help Tina!

439
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:51,677
Jamie's not in her room! She's nowhere in sight!

440
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,837
Hey!
- Loomis!

441
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,397
What the hell are you doing?
- Jamie's gone.

442
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:09,797
I'm gonna find Tina.

443
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,997
You ... you don't even know where sh ... she is.

444
00:47:14,157 --> 00:47:15,197
But, I do.

445
00:47:15,437 --> 00:47:16,637
Where?

446
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:18,557
The Tower Farm.

447
00:47:23,237 --> 00:47:25,277
Love your costume.
- Oh, baby!

448
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:32,477
Tina?

449
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:34,197
What?
- Where's Mike?

450
00:47:34,797 --> 00:47:36,677
Ask me if I care.

451
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:42,837
What are you doing?

452
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:45,477
What are you doing?
- Sitting here.

453
00:47:56,477 --> 00:47:57,437
What do you think?

454
00:47:58,077 --> 00:47:59,637
Well, orders are orders.

455
00:48:00,637 --> 00:48:02,837
That look like a life-threatening situation to you?

456
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:04,837
Nah.

457
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:07,757
Play crazy eights?

458
00:48:29,837 --> 00:48:31,037
Spitz and I just had ...

459
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:33,397
... greatest night together.
- Yeah. What?

460
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:37,357
Let's go.

461
00:48:45,637 --> 00:48:48,197
Oh, now wait. Hey, you cheated there.
- I did not cheat. - Come on

462
00:48:48,317 --> 00:48:49,757
I did not cheat.

463
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,197
Take me, but spare my friend!

464
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:02,957
She's a virgin.

465
00:49:03,677 --> 00:49:05,237
Got her phone number?

466
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,077
Do you think that's funny?

467
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:12,557
Hey, hey, no, man.
No. Hey, just a little Halloween prank, okay?

468
00:49:12,677 --> 00:49:15,077
Definitely not ... funny!

469
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,517
Somebody could easily be dead right now!

470
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:19,837
Fortunately, we're lousy cops.

471
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:20,957
Sorry.

472
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:23,317
Hey, guys!

473
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:25,197
Hey.

474
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:27,037
Look, what I found.

475
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:16,677
Ohh! Kittens!

476
00:50:17,837 --> 00:50:18,957
Oh, look at 'em.

477
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:22,677
Hello.
Hello babies.

478
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:26,637
Hello.
Oh, they're so cute.

479
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:30,637
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
- Get 'em, Tina! Get 'em!

480
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:34,357
You, you, you, wait, wait, wait.
Thinking of getting kitten?

481
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:41,237
Little, wee cat.

482
00:50:42,997 --> 00:50:43,717
Kitten?

483
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:48,917
Psst! Kitten.

484
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:52,117
I'm coming to get you!

485
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:03,517
Kitten?

486
00:51:23,437 --> 00:51:24,277
Kitten ...

487
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:26,997
I hear you, but I don't see you.

488
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:43,717
Oh, my God.

489
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:57,317
What am I doing?
I hate cats.

490
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:01,957
Sam?

491
00:52:04,677 --> 00:52:05,677
Sammy?

492
00:52:08,277 --> 00:52:09,557
Spitz?

493
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:29,077
I hate you!

494
00:52:29,597 --> 00:52:32,597
Sorry. - God!
- Did you see her face?

495
00:52:32,997 --> 00:52:34,517
You guys!

496
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:41,117
Fine, I'll just let myself out. Bye.
- I'll be right back.

497
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,597
Have fun.
- Okay.

498
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,757
Spitz!

499
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:10,837
What makes you think I'm gonna try and find you, huh?

500
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:19,397
I got you!

501
00:53:30,237 --> 00:53:32,717
I saw you.

502
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:48,437
Spitz, I'm out of here!

503
00:53:48,677 --> 00:53:49,877
Good night!

504
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:04,797
Spitz.

505
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:07,957
Spitz!

506
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:12,797
Oh, my God!

507
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:19,437
You son of a bitch!
You scared me half to death!

508
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,557
It wasn't funny!

509
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:22,677
Spitz, no.

510
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:24,077
Spitz.
- Why?

511
00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:25,037
Why?
- No.

512
00:56:25,157 --> 00:56:27,277
What's the matter?
- Because I don't ... have anything.

513
00:57:36,437 --> 00:57:38,797
You son of a bitch!

514
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:46,237
That sounded different.

515
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:50,077
Yeah, we never did stuff like that when we were kids.
- No, we were normal.

516
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,477
Yeah, let's see what it is.

517
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:57,877
Hey, fella!

518
00:57:57,997 --> 00:57:59,077
Over here!

519
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:05,237
Hey, come on. Enough's enough, all right?
- Somebody can get hurt with that thing.

520
00:58:05,317 --> 00:58:07,397
Hey, somebody's gonna get hurt with that thing!

521
00:58:09,637 --> 00:58:12,037
Unbelievable! No respect for authority anymore.

522
00:58:12,157 --> 00:58:14,277
Well, it's the parents.
- Yeah. - Hey!

523
00:58:14,637 --> 00:58:17,357
All right, punk.
I'm through fooling around.

524
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:22,877
Hey, Sarah!

525
00:58:25,677 --> 00:58:30,437
So, you coming to the spring?
Oh, baby. You just wanna see me naked.
- I wouldn't mind.

526
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:33,797
Come on. The hell with Mike. He ain't gonna show.

527
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,317
I can't leave Sam and Spitz.

528
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:41,517
Hurry, hurry!

529
00:58:46,477 --> 00:58:47,117
Hurry!

530
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:48,117
Come on!

531
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:07,237
Sam?

532
00:59:08,637 --> 00:59:10,437
You guys?

533
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:16,797
You guys, I don't hear any noise.

534
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:19,837
Are you sure you're doing it right?

535
00:59:29,237 --> 00:59:31,237
You guys wanna come skinny-dipping?

536
00:59:35,637 --> 00:59:38,037
Maybe you guys are already naked.

537
00:59:44,437 --> 00:59:45,517
Oh, God.

538
00:59:47,957 --> 00:59:49,277
Oh, my God.

539
01:00:00,837 --> 01:00:01,877
Help me!

540
01:00:02,157 --> 01:00:06,397
Help me, please! Somebody, help me! Please, help me!

541
01:00:06,997 --> 01:00:08,637
No!

542
01:00:13,597 --> 01:00:14,957
Oh, God!

543
01:00:15,037 --> 01:00:17,277
Help me!
Please, help me!

544
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:19,797
Help me!

545
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:34,277
Mike.

546
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:36,997
Tina!

547
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:49,277
Tina!

548
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,917
Leave her alone!

549
01:01:00,037 --> 01:01:01,437
Help!

550
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:03,717
What do you want?!

551
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:10,437
Leave her!

552
01:01:13,117 --> 01:01:14,597
No.
- Here.

553
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:16,397
Here!

554
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:23,037
Billy!

555
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:26,797
No!

556
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:31,557
Billy, no!

557
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:34,317
Please!

558
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:35,677
Help!

559
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:36,717
Please!

560
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:41,957
Please!

561
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:44,757
Help!

562
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:47,797
Help!

563
01:01:52,597 --> 01:01:53,597
No!

564
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:54,877
Please!

565
01:01:55,117 --> 01:01:57,277
Stay here, Billy. I'll be back.

566
01:01:58,237 --> 01:01:59,837
Leave her alone!

567
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:02,157
Oh, my God!

568
01:02:05,557 --> 01:02:06,397
Jamie!

569
01:02:09,157 --> 01:02:12,237
Help me!
- Leave her alone!

570
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:13,477
Stop!

571
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:16,797
Stop! Jamie!

572
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:03,157
Tina!

573
01:03:04,237 --> 01:03:05,437
Baby.

574
01:03:05,557 --> 01:03:06,837
Tina!

575
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:08,637
Tina!

576
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:40,797
No!

577
01:03:41,037 --> 01:03:42,237
Oh, God!

578
01:03:42,877 --> 01:03:44,197
No!

579
01:03:49,357 --> 01:03:50,677
No!

580
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:01,757
No!

581
01:04:02,557 --> 01:04:04,117
Jamie!

582
01:04:06,437 --> 01:04:07,477
Run!

583
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:12,637
No!

584
01:04:15,637 --> 01:04:17,797
No! No!

585
01:04:19,517 --> 01:04:22,277
Come on!
- No! Tina!

586
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:25,517
No!
- Run!

587
01:04:25,677 --> 01:04:27,197
Tina!

588
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:31,077
Tina!

589
01:04:31,317 --> 01:04:32,757
Come on.

590
01:04:35,717 --> 01:04:36,717
No...

591
01:04:37,157 --> 01:04:38,917
Tina!

592
01:04:40,117 --> 01:04:41,277
Tina!

593
01:04:42,957 --> 01:04:44,197
Tina!

594
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:55,597
Tin - Tina!

595
01:04:58,277 --> 01:05:00,477
All right, spread out and keep in contact!

596
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:04,037
Don't shoot!
- There's two of 'em right here!

597
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:06,037
Loomis!
- Yeah, I've got them here.

598
01:05:06,317 --> 01:05:07,717
Come on. Get 'em out of here!

599
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,997
Spread out. Find the other girl!
- Where's the other one?

600
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:12,637
Come on, Loomis!
- Get these back here!

601
01:05:12,717 --> 01:05:15,157
Tina's still missing!
- The other girl's still missing!

602
01:05:15,317 --> 01:05:17,237
All right, come on ...
- Watch yourself!

603
01:05:18,797 --> 01:05:20,637
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
- Jamie ...

604
01:05:21,157 --> 01:05:22,517
It's gonna be all right.
- Help Tina, please!

605
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:30,677
Tina!

606
01:05:31,357 --> 01:05:34,877
Tina! Tina!

607
01:05:40,517 --> 01:05:45,317
All right. Put three units over at the reservoir ...,
and let me know when ...
- Now are you willing to help me?

608
01:05:45,397 --> 01:05:46,837
<i>I wanna keep an eye on that ...</i>

609
01:05:47,037 --> 01:05:48,557
Can you kill him?

610
01:05:50,277 --> 01:05:51,077
I think so.

611
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:54,037
Now wait a minute, Loomis. There isn't a minute to wait.

612
01:05:56,997 --> 01:05:58,757
What do you want me to do?

613
01:06:21,397 --> 01:06:22,197
Michael.

614
01:06:24,037 --> 01:06:26,477
It will destroy you too.

615
01:06:27,837 --> 01:06:29,237
One day,

616
01:06:29,997 --> 01:06:31,277
Michael ...

617
01:06:32,397 --> 01:06:34,597
this rage ...

618
01:06:35,837 --> 01:06:37,797
which drives you.

619
01:06:38,637 --> 01:06:41,677
You think if you kill them all, it will go away?

620
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:44,477
It won't.

621
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:47,837
You have to fight it ...

622
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:50,517
in the place where it's strongest.

623
01:06:53,157 --> 01:06:55,277
Where it all began!

624
01:06:57,637 --> 01:07:01,077
-if you want to get rid of this ... rage.

625
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:05,597
Michael, go home.

626
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:07,397
Go home!

627
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:10,717
Go to your house.

628
01:07:10,837 --> 01:07:13,477
I shall be there waiting for you!

629
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:15,917
You'll find ...

630
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:17,357
her ...

631
01:07:17,997 --> 01:07:19,717
waiting for you.

632
01:07:56,557 --> 01:07:57,917
Can he see us from the street?

633
01:07:58,517 --> 01:07:59,957
Not a chance.

634
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:07,797
Station one, are you sure he can't see you?

635
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,397
<i>Inside units, I want a report every five minutes.
- Roger.</i>

636
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:16,197
10 - 4.

637
01:08:17,597 --> 01:08:19,717
He may not be able to see you, Sheriff ...

638
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,837
But we can all certainly hear you.

639
01:08:24,117 --> 01:08:26,637
All right, relax, Loomis. This is my operation.

640
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:29,717
All right, fellas. Let's keep it down on the radio chatter.

641
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:36,917
Looks like you and me are the only ones
around here keeping our cool.

642
01:08:38,277 --> 01:08:39,517
Good idea.

643
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:41,917
You wanna practice our signals?

644
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:43,357
All right.

645
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,117
You do that good and loud,
I'll be out here ...

646
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:54,477
in a flash.

647
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,757
You're one brave little girl.

648
01:09:12,957 --> 01:09:14,437
Bi - Billy?

649
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:18,317
Billy!

650
01:09:21,397 --> 01:09:22,557
Billy!

651
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:26,957
Dr. Loomis!

652
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:31,637
Bi - Billy.
- Dr. Loomis!

653
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:33,277
Billy!

654
01:09:34,277 --> 01:09:36,237
Meeker, he's at the clinic.

655
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:37,757
Bi - Billy.

656
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:40,677
This is car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

657
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:43,117
Car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

658
01:09:43,717 --> 01:09:45,757
We just had a distress call from the clinic.

659
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:47,197
They haven't been able to reach them again.

660
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:48,797
There were four men up there.

661
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:51,717
All right. This is Sheriff Meeker.

662
01:09:52,237 --> 01:09:53,557
All mobile units ...

663
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:55,717
proceed immediately to the Masterson Clinic.

664
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:56,757
Okay, let's go!

665
01:09:57,717 --> 01:09:59,117
Move out! Move out!

666
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:04,877
Come on. Get going.

667
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:07,037
Stop dragging your ass!
Move, move, move!

668
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:12,197
All right. You stay here.
Loomis, I'm moving the girl to the police station.
She'll be safer there.

669
01:10:13,117 --> 01:10:14,157
Understood.

670
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:15,277
Move it out!

671
01:10:15,437 --> 01:10:19,477
Let's go! - We're all clear.
- The girl, Charlie and Loomis are in this there.
- All right. I got it.

672
01:10:20,117 --> 01:10:21,077
Come on! Let's get out of here.

673
01:10:47,357 --> 01:10:49,077
Now you'll come.

674
01:10:49,757 --> 01:10:51,397
Won't you, Michael?

675
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,597
I'd say you've done your night's work.

676
01:10:58,117 --> 01:11:00,717
Come on. My pal Eddie and I'll
give you a ride to the station.

677
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:02,437
Let's go.

678
01:11:06,397 --> 01:11:07,677
Dr. Loomis.

679
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:15,197
What the hell are you doing?

680
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:17,757
We aren't taking her ... anywhere.

681
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:21,077
You've got five seconds to give me that key ...

682
01:11:21,197 --> 01:11:22,437
before I take it.

683
01:11:23,957 --> 01:11:25,517
<i>Charlie.
Can you read me?</i>

684
01:11:25,957 --> 01:11:27,717
This is Charlie. What's going on?

685
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,037
There's a car approaching.

686
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,277
<i>I'll check it out.</i>

687
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,557
Looks like one of ours.
It's a code two.

688
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:40,437
Eddie, do you read me?

689
01:11:46,197 --> 01:11:47,597
Eddie, can you read me?

690
01:11:58,557 --> 01:11:59,717
Eddie, come in!

691
01:12:03,477 --> 01:12:04,357
Christ!

692
01:12:04,877 --> 01:12:06,197
I've got to call Meeker.

693
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:10,797
You crazy son of a bitch!

694
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:13,357
Charlie.

695
01:12:15,157 --> 01:12:16,797
Charlie ...

696
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,757
Michael Myers ...

697
01:12:19,037 --> 01:12:21,077
is outside.

698
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:24,757
Stay with the little girl.

699
01:12:25,837 --> 01:12:26,997
Please?

700
01:12:39,117 --> 01:12:40,317
This is all right.

701
01:12:41,677 --> 01:12:43,197
Don't worry about this.

702
01:13:05,317 --> 01:13:06,677
We have to get out of here.

703
01:13:23,957 --> 01:13:24,797
You ...

704
01:13:25,597 --> 01:13:27,797
You've come back to us, Michael?

705
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:51,357
I ...

706
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:56,157
I know why you've come back, Michael.

707
01:13:57,757 --> 01:13:59,757
Because the little girl ...

708
01:14:01,077 --> 01:14:04,837
The little girl can stop the rage inside.

709
01:14:05,997 --> 01:14:08,397
She knows how to do it, Michael.

710
01:14:08,597 --> 01:14:09,957
If you let her.

711
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:11,397
She can s ...

712
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:13,637
stop the rage ...

713
01:14:14,357 --> 01:14:16,357
The rage inside.

714
01:14:17,677 --> 01:14:19,597
Oh, she's not up there, Michael.

715
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:23,557
She's down here in the middle of the old house where ...

716
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:30,237
Your house ... Michael.

717
01:14:31,397 --> 01:14:32,677
Your house.

718
01:14:34,357 --> 01:14:35,797
Don't you remember ...

719
01:14:36,157 --> 01:14:37,757
how much better ...

720
01:14:37,837 --> 01:14:39,597
you used to be?

721
01:14:40,597 --> 01:14:42,477
Let ... let me take you ...

722
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:45,197
Let me take you to her.

723
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,277
She'll take the rage away.

724
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:49,397
Michael ...

725
01:14:49,477 --> 01:14:50,437
you'll be ...

726
01:14:52,437 --> 01:14:53,917
better ... then.

727
01:14:54,877 --> 01:14:56,237
You don't need the ...

728
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:02,317
You don't need that.

729
01:15:13,997 --> 01:15:14,757
Hurry!

730
01:15:15,157 --> 01:15:16,237
Please!

731
01:15:22,557 --> 01:15:23,677
Hurry!

732
01:15:28,717 --> 01:15:29,677
Please ...

733
01:15:43,757 --> 01:15:45,357
All right. Get on that side over there.

734
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:46,397
Step over it.

735
01:15:49,157 --> 01:15:49,837
All right.

736
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:52,197
I need you on my back.

737
01:15:52,597 --> 01:15:53,717
You just hold on.

738
01:15:59,157 --> 01:15:59,877
All right.

739
01:16:18,397 --> 01:16:19,317
All right.

740
01:16:21,157 --> 01:16:22,157
Come on.

741
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:46,317
Come on, kids.

742
01:16:46,677 --> 01:16:47,597
No!, this side.

743
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:49,117
Yes, sir.
- Inside. There!

744
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:51,597
Hold it.

745
01:16:52,677 --> 01:16:54,597
Oh, God. Damn it!

746
01:16:55,237 --> 01:16:56,037
Move it. Quickly!

747
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:58,957
All right. When everybody's out.
I want a sweep of the building and grounds.

748
01:16:58,997 --> 01:17:01,877
<i>Sheriff Meeker, do you copy?
- Yeah! - Third floor's secure. Willie's on the second</i>

749
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:03,117
All right, keep it up.

750
01:17:59,597 --> 01:18:01,157
Please don't let him get me.

751
01:18:01,397 --> 01:18:02,517
Please, God.

752
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:23,957
No ...

753
01:22:16,117 --> 01:22:17,277
Max!

754
01:22:21,797 --> 01:22:23,477
No!

755
01:22:24,077 --> 01:22:25,757
Rachel!

756
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:27,277
No!

757
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:36,077
Rachel?

758
01:22:38,717 --> 01:22:39,397
Help me. Help me.

759
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:14,917
Uncle?

760
01:23:17,437 --> 01:23:18,717
Boogeyman?

761
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:32,157
Let me see.

762
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,157
You're just like me.

763
01:24:07,117 --> 01:24:07,957
Let me.

764
01:24:28,037 --> 01:24:29,157
Oh, God!

765
01:24:32,117 --> 01:24:33,877
You want her?

766
01:24:34,157 --> 01:24:36,117
No!
- Here she is!

767
01:24:37,597 --> 01:24:39,077
She's yours!

768
01:24:39,637 --> 01:24:42,597
No!
- Your ... little girl! - No!

769
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:43,957
Oh, no!

770
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:48,437
No! No!
- Come and get her.

771
01:24:48,837 --> 01:24:49,877
Please!

772
01:24:50,117 --> 01:24:51,317
Come and ...
- No!

773
01:24:53,437 --> 01:24:56,677
No! Please!
- Come and get your little girl. - No!

774
01:24:57,397 --> 01:25:02,317
No!
- Come take us both. - No!

775
01:25:03,277 --> 01:25:04,077
No!

776
01:25:04,357 --> 01:25:05,197
Michael ...

777
01:25:06,837 --> 01:25:08,597
Let's play a game.
- No.

778
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:11,757
Can you catch the little girl? Come catch.

779
01:25:11,837 --> 01:25:12,557
No!

780
01:25:12,637 --> 01:25:13,597
Michael.
- No.

781
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:19,317
No!
- Get the little girl, then ... then you're home and safe.

782
01:26:03,677 --> 01:26:05,637
Die! Die!

783
01:26:05,797 --> 01:26:08,917
Die! Die, Michael!

784
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:12,397
Die!

785
01:26:15,797 --> 01:26:17,997
Die! Die!

786
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:20,797
D ...

787
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:05,157
National Guard will take him
to a maximum security facility.

788
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:07,837
Where he'll stay till the day he dies.

789
01:27:09,197 --> 01:27:10,637
He'll never die.

790
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:13,317
All right. Take her back to the clinic.

791
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:14,677
Come on.

792
01:27:25,757 --> 01:27:27,277
Ok, Tony I'll see you in the morning, huh?

793
01:27:27,357 --> 01:27:28,197
Good job.
- All right. Take care. Joe's back.

794
01:27:32,157 --> 01:27:32,877
Hey Joe!

795
01:27:34,597 --> 01:27:35,357
Yeah.

796
01:27:35,957 --> 01:27:38,237
Don't forget. You said you'd cover for me tomorrow.

797
01:27:38,477 --> 01:27:40,117
Yeah, I got it. Don't worry about it.

798
01:27:40,557 --> 01:27:41,437
Take it easy.

799
01:27:41,677 --> 01:27:43,877
Hey, you said you're gonna cover for me too!
- Get out of here.

800
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:11,397
Spread out!

801
01:28:13,757 --> 01:28:14,677
Wait in the car.

802
01:29:50,797 --> 01:29:52,597
No.

803
01:29:53,797 --> 01:29:55,037
No!
