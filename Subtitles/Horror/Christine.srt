1
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,010
Now, on the day I was born

2
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,447
The nurses aIl gathered round

3
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,644
And they gazed in wild wonder

4
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,279
At the joy they had found

5
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,550
The head nurse spoke up

6
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,956
Said leave this one alone

7
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,358
She could tell right away

8
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,989
That l was bad to the bone

9
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,260
Bad to the bone

10
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,160
B-B-B-B-B-Bad

11
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,505
Bad to the bone

12
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,979
l broke 1,000 hearts

13
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,039
Before l met you

14
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,312
l'll break 1,000 more, baby

15
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,014
Before I am through

16
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,319
l want to be yours, pretty baby

17
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,621
Yours, and yours alone

18
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,093
l'm here to tell you, honey

19
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,723
That I'm bad to the bone

20
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,130
Bad to the bone

21
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,135
B-B-B-B-B-Bad

22
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,509
Bad to the bone

23
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,749
l'm a-gonna tell you
how it's gonna be

24
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,559
You gonna give
your love to me

25
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,013
My love is bigger
than the Cadillac

26
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,784
After l show you I'll be back

27
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,558
Your love for me
has got to be real

28
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:56,827
Holy shit!

29
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,924
Come on, Arnie.

30
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,238
He's coming.
He's changing his shirt.

31
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,699
That's noise pollution,
what you're doing.

32
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,842
You might as well be dumping
toxic waste on our lawn.

33
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,011
Hey, Dennis.
l'll be right there.

34
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,419
Just leave it.
lt's okay.

35
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,582
Go on. lt's okay.

36
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,592
Arnie, your lunch!

37
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,263
Try and keep it cold.
There's yogurt in there.

38
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,355
Right.

39
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,537
Slow down !

40
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,946
Are you guys having a war?

41
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,977
She's pissed otf
'cause l'm taking shop. My dad too.

42
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,787
lt won't embarrass them when you
fix their stupid Volvo for free.

43
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,794
- What?
- Last night, we're playing Scrabble.

44
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,695
It's neck-and-neck between me and her.
We blew my dad away early.

45
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:43,202
So, at the end, l had this choice
of ''ratio'' for five lousy points...

46
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,396
- or...
- Or what, Arnie?

47
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,702
''tellatio'' for 24 points
and the game.

48
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,608
- What'd she do?
- She won by seven points...

49
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,838
because obscenity's not allowed
in Scrabble.

50
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:58,873
- And it's in the dictionary!
- You jerk, Arnie. Jesus.

51
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,288
You know, Arnie,
l was thinking--

52
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,349
Uh-oh.

53
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,395
No, seriously.

54
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,228
Now that we're gonna be seniors,
l figure it's about time,..

55
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,891
that we got you laid.

56
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,097
- You know, like this year, huh?
- You need a girl to get laid.

57
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,599
- What about Gail Justin?
- l don't like her mustache.

58
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:28,511
Fuck you! What do you care
if you get a little hair in your mouth?

59
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,717
Okay. How about Sally Hayes?
She's cute.

60
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,722
- She's a sophomore!
- So what? She's a walking sperm bank.

61
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,724
l know. Come on.

62
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,023
l don't have the minimum deposit
to open an account.

63
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,293
Are you kidding? You carry
your lite savings between your legs.

64
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,661
Come on, Arnie.

65
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,670
l think maybe
l'll just beat off.

66
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,875
Are you playing
football this year or what?

67
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,974
Somebody's got to pick it up
when you fumble.

68
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,383
- Hey, Terry.
- How's your gimpy knee?

69
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,614
lt's better.
Coach wants me to practice.

70
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,648
Yeah? lt's about time. l've been eatin'
dirt with your name on it for weeks.

71
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,095
Hi, Dennis.

72
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,861
Oh, hey, Roseanne.
How you doing?

73
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:26,303
I'm okay. They gonna
let you play tootball?

74
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,498
Yeah.

75
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,541
Doc says l'm as good as new.

76
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,268
Then I guess
l'lI be seeing you out there.

77
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,044
l hope so.

78
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,818
Well, T.T.F.N.

79
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,086
Yeah. Ta-ta for now.

80
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,029
I wouldn't put that in my mouth.

81
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,031
- You don't know where it's been.
- Get outta here.

82
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,398
But we know where it hasn't been.
With you.

83
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,063
- Having trouble with your locker?
- No.

84
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,039
- Did you see the new girl?
- l just got here!

85
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:07,136
- l'm in love, and l'm fussy.
- l never noticed you were fussy.

86
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,805
Drop dead, Cunningham.

87
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,145
- What's her name?
- l don't know. She's in the office.

88
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,210
She looks smart,
but she's got a slut's body.

89
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,549
Oh, shit. Here she comes.

90
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,093
l think you'll like it here, Leigh.

91
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,322
Give me something
for my lap.

92
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,528
We have a good band. Went to the Rose
Parade. Not a bad way to meet boys.

93
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,570
l would like to get involved
with the yearbook.

94
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,573
We have a territic yearbook staff.
Won a prize last year.

95
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:40,237
So, what about admitting
Red China into the U. N.?

96
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,713
- l think we already did that.
- Yeah, but...

97
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,774
do you think it was a good idea?

98
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,816
She smiled at me.

99
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,119
l want to have deep,
meaningful sex with her.

100
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,160
- Go get her, Bemis.
- Think l should?

101
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,025
You've got nothing
to lose but your virginity.

102
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,498
Dennis, can you give me a hand?

103
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,470
- I can't--
- Yeah.

104
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,269
- He doesn't have a chance.
- l don't think so either.

105
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,675
She's much too classy for him.

106
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,077
- There you go.
- What did you do?

107
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,377
Lucky. See you at lunch.

108
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,565
Hey, Charley.
Have you seen Arnie?

109
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,625
- Yeah. He's still in the shop.
- What's the matter?

110
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,136
Buddy Repperton has his lunch.

111
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,139
- Buddy Repperton.
- Hi, Dennis--

112
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,312
Come on, pizza face.

113
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,815
You want it?
Come get it!

114
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,186
lf it's yours,
why isn't your name on here anywhere?

115
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,849
''Arnie Cuntingham.''

116
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,052
Why doesn't it say Cuntingham?

117
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,859
Just take it, and let's go eat.

118
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,062
That's all you got to do.
Come on.

119
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,649
That's funny, Buddy,
real funny.

120
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,262
Go get Mr. Casey.

121
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,032
Come on.
You want to go for it?

122
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,974
Put the knife down.

123
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,840
- Put down the knife.
- You want to make me?

124
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,543
You've got a knife and he doesn't.
That makes you a chicken shit.

125
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,483
- Yeah. That's chicken shit.
- Yeah?

126
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,283
- Put it down.
- Yeah, put down the knite.

127
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,289
Put down the knife, okay?

128
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,040
Get him, man !

129
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,261
How do you like that, dickface?

130
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,299
AlI right, break it up!
Right now.

131
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,964
You kids take a walk.
Get lost.

132
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,529
Not you, Moochie.

133
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,702
- l ain't been doing nothing.
- You all right, Dennis?

134
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,680
Yeah, l'm okay.

135
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,009
ReaI cute.
Three on one.

136
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,947
They started it.

137
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,516
- That's not true.
- Shut up, cuntface!

138
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,152
Shut your mouth!

139
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,528
l don't have to listen
to garbage like that, Buddy!

140
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,460
What were you saying?

141
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,063
Repperton's got a knife.

142
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,801
You fucking liar!

143
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,174
lt's a switchblade.

144
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,976
That's bullshit, Mr. Casey.
He's lying. l swear to God.

145
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,449
Did Repperton here
pull a knife on you?

146
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,491
Yeah.

147
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,760
Empty your pockets, Buddy.

148
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,794
Fuck l will.
You can't make me.

149
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,171
lf you mean l don't have the authority,
you're wrong.

150
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,370
Try it, you bald fuck, and l'll
knock you through the wall! Fuck!

151
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,851
You two boys go up to the office.
Stay there.

152
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,253
Don't go anywhere.
You've got enough trouble.

153
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,324
Now...

154
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,830
if you don't empty your pockets
right now, l'm gonna call the cops.

155
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,400
Go to the office, Buddy.

156
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,552
I'll fix you!

157
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,282
You're gonna wish you were
never fucking born!

158
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,664
So, all in all,
it wasn't a bad first day.

159
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,245
Think Repperton
will try to get even?

160
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,474
No, he's a douche bag.

161
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,176
He'll tind somebody
else to pick on.

162
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,277
- They kicked him out, you know.
- Good.

163
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,515
They kick Moochie out?

164
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,717
Probation.

165
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,726
Those assholes.

166
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,127
Stop the car! Quick!
Go back!

167
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,223
- What's the matter?
- l want to look at her!

168
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,462
- All right, Arnie.
- Just go back. All right?

169
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,470
Jesus Christ.

170
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,813
What is it?

171
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,677
Do you know someone who lives here?

172
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,059
What?

173
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,268
Jesus.

174
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,419
Be careful, Dennis.

175
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,723
- This is a piece of shit,
- She could be fixed up.

176
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,694
- Yeah.
- Oh, she could be really tough.

177
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,760
Forget it. This baby's got
93,000 miles on it.

178
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,033
Probably 193.

179
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,077
I don't care.

180
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,545
- l bet it won't even start.
- She'll start.

181
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,549
You need these.

182
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,251
How much do you want for her?

183
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,693
- Whatever it is, it's not enough.
- Jesus, Arnie.

184
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,540
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?

185
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:28,406
- Yeah, he owns a Mustang--
- No. l just got my license.

186
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,974
Name's George LeBay.

187
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,084
Arnie Cunningham.
What are you asking?

188
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,555
Start her up.

189
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,992
Really?

190
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,302
Her name's Christine.

191
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,673
l like that.

192
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,371
Come on. We gotta get going.

193
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,607
My asshole brother
bought her in September, '57.

194
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,979
You got your new model year
in September.

195
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,575
Brand-new, she was.

196
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,520
She had the smell
of a brand-new car.

197
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,958
About the finest smell in the world,
except maybe for pussy.

198
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,856
When he got her,
she had six miles on the odometer.

199
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,167
Goddamn Roland went through hell
and back with Christine.

200
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,600
lf your brother loves this car so much,
why is he selling it?

201
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,101
'Cause he's stone cold dead.

202
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,772
Died six weeks ago.

203
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,113
So, Mr. LeBay...

204
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,811
how much do you want for her?

205
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,616
l've been asking 300.

206
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,754
l'll make it 250 tor you.

207
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,386
250? This isn't worth 50 bucks.

208
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,693
The money's not important,
and there'll be no bringing her back...

209
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,165
'cause I'm selling this shit hole
and buying me a condo.

210
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,226
You got a deal.

211
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,737
l'll get the pink slip.

212
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,034
WiIl you stop and think about this
tor a moment?

213
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,479
- Where are you getting the money?
- l've been saving all summer.

214
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,643
- For college.
- You already have a car.

215
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,550
He's screwing you.

216
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,987
You could get a decent car
for that much money.

217
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,752
Christine is decent.

218
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,817
The guy's weird, Arnie.

219
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,954
He's fucking weird.

220
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,693
- So that was 300?
- Yeah, that's it.

221
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,668
- You said 250.
- 250 would do it.

222
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,901
It this is a good idea,
let's just come back tomorrow.

223
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,703
Do you realize
she's 20 years old?

224
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,337
l mean, that makes her
officially an antique.

225
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:45,873
Great. DarneIl's junkyard
is full of official antiques.

226
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,148
l'm buying her.
l don't care what you say.

227
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,189
It's your funeral, man.

228
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,165
Would you give
Arnie a break?

229
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,224
He doesn't know what he's doing.

230
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,230
You don't know half as much
as you think you do...

231
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,069
shitter.

232
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,574
You did what?

233
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,342
- She's outside.
- You're kidding, right?

234
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,113
You can't buy a car.
What are you talking about?

235
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,644
- You're 17 years old.
- Oh, boy.

236
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,486
Actually, you're wrong.

237
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,517
l couldn't finance it,
but buying it for cash is no problem.

238
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,929
Registering a car at 17
is something else...

239
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,331
and for that
l need your permission.

240
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,631
You know how we do things.

241
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,369
You could've consulted with us.

242
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,469
l've consulted with you
about every damn thing I've ever done.

243
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,538
lf it's something l want,
l get outvoted, two to one!

244
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,084
This is no committee meeting.
l bought the car, and that's it!

245
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:57,281
lt most certainly
is not it!

246
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,723
How could you have
let him do this?

247
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,523
l didn't let him.
He wanted the car, and he bought it.

248
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,228
l tried to talk him out ot it.

249
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,827
l doubt you tried very hard.

250
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,669
- Yeah, well, l'm going home.
- l think you should.

251
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,675
That's it. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

252
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,270
- What kind of lang--
- What did you say!

253
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,310
You wanted me in college courses.
l'm there.

254
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,355
You wanted chess club instead of band.
l'm there too.

255
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,654
l've managed 17 years without
embarrassing you or landing in jail.

256
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,627
l'm gonna have this one thing!

257
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,861
You are not keeping
any car at this house.

258
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,492
Fine!

259
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,170
Thanks for the milk.

260
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,180
- What's the problem?
- Could you honk your horn for me?

261
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,746
Christine's doesn't
seem to work.

262
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,759
- Ah. Sure,
- Thanks.

263
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,161
Stall 20.

264
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,692
Get it over there
and shut it off...

265
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,065
before we all
choke to death.

266
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,131
Kiddo, if you sold him that piece of
shit, you ought to be fuckin' ashamed.

267
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,235
l didn't sell it to him.
l tried to talk him out of it.

268
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,473
You should have tried harder.

269
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,829
l knew a guy who had
a car like that once.

270
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,766
Fuckin' bastard
killed himself in it.

271
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,769
Son of a bitch was so mean...

272
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,998
if you poured boiIing water
down his throat...

273
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,303
he would have pissed ice cubes.

274
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,142
Okay.
That's the last time...

275
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,478
you run that mechanical asshole
in here without an exhaust hose.

276
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,383
I catch you doin' it one time,
and you're out. You understand?

277
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,914
- Huh?
- Yes.

278
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,457
l'm gonna tell you
something else right now.

279
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,521
I don't take any shit
trom you kids.

280
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:28,794
This place is for working stiffs,
gotta keep their cars runnin'.

281
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,268
lt's not for rich-assed, snot-nosed kids
draggin' on the Orange Belt.

282
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:36,467
l don't allow no smoking in here
neither. You go out in the junkyard.

283
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:40,068
- l don't smoke.
- Don't interrupt me, punk.

284
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,012
Don't interrupt me.
Don't get smart.

285
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,417
- Ah, sir?
- What?

286
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,288
Those men over there are smoking.
Better tell them to stop.

287
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,120
You trying to help your buddy
right out of here, Chuck?

288
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,365
Then shut your pie hole.

289
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,405
l know a creep when l see one.

290
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,237
l think l'm looking
at one right now.

291
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,108
You're on probation.
You get it?

292
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,980
You screw around with me...

293
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,110
l don't care how much money
you paid up in front...

294
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,214
l'll throw you out
on your ass! You got it?

295
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,226
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,921
Good.

297
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,834
Now get the hell out of here.
We're closed.

298
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,054
You gonna be okay?

299
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,525
Yeah. l'm okay.

300
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:11,364
You know, you better find yourself some
other charity besides me and Christine.

301
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,829
What is it about that car?

302
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,111
I don't know.

303
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,850
Maybe it's just that for the first time
l've found something uglier than me.

304
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,878
And l know l can fix her up.

305
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,890
You're not ugly, Arnie.

306
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,960
I know what l am,

307
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,631
Queer, maybe, but not ugly.

308
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,491
Fuck you.

309
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,807
Oh, bug out, Dennis.
You don't need this shit.

310
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,017
Where have you been?
You had us worried sick!

311
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,821
You don't just up and drive off
whenever you--

312
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:24,968
As I walk along l wonder

313
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:29,776
What went wrong with our love

314
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,681
A love that was so strong

315
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,898
He's done all this shit
in three weeks.

316
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,268
Look how cockeyed he works.

317
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,672
He's got tuckin' brand-new
windshield wipers...

318
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,972
for a busted windshield.

319
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,244
Well, the boy does
have good hands.

320
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,748
Good hands.

321
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,876
Bad taste in cars.

322
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:15,191
You know, Papa,
you can't polish a turd.

323
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:46,386
When l said you could scrounge through
that shit pile out back...

324
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:51,395
l didn't mean you could build
your whole fuckin' car with my stuff.

325
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,921
What do you care?
You're not doing anything with it.

326
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,867
Hey! Don't think you
got the gold key to the crapper.

327
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,303
Nobody takes advantage
of me, understand?

328
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,373
Yeah.

329
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:09,106
lf it wasn't for me, it'd cost you
a shit pile to put this heap together.

330
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,613
l know.

331
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,888
Look.

332
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,590
l know you ain't got money
falling out of your asshole.

333
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,095
lf you did,
you wouldn't be here.

334
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,765
Maybe we could work out
some kind of a deal.

335
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,975
You...

336
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,478
pick up around the place.

337
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,481
Do a few lubes...

338
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,614
put the toilet paper
on the little spools...

339
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,950
shit like that.

340
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,149
Do that and you can--

341
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:57,854
you can raid my junk pile
for whatever you want.

342
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,160
l might even throw in
a few bucks.

343
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,669
l'll have to think about it.

344
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,696
WeIl, don't think about it too long!
l'll throw you out on your fuckin' ass.

345
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,568
Forever, my darling

346
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:42,970
My love will be true

347
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,976
Always and forever

348
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,480
I'll love just you

349
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,180
Just promise me, darling

350
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,785
Your love in return

351
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,192
May this fire in my soul, dear

352
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,893
Forever burn

353
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:15,938
My heart's at your command, dear

354
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,211
l'll bet you a dollar
she says no.

355
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,212
Just 'cause she shot you down?

356
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,044
She says no to everybody.

357
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,483
Look what she's doing
to that pencil.

358
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,290
l wish l was an eraser.

359
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,034
Go on, studley.
Ask her out.

360
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,468
Mind your own business.
Just read the book.

361
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:50,405
Yeah. Come on.
Just don't tip the table over.

362
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,302
What are you reading?

363
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,364
- History.
- Oh.

364
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,571
- lt's pretty boring, huh?
- Yeah.

365
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,408
Listen, do you like music?

366
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,479
What about dancing?

367
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,214
Yes.

368
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,820
Do you think you might...

369
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,291
want to go dancing with me...

370
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,762
like maybe this Friday night
after the game?

371
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,490
l'm sorry. I can't.

372
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,776
Why not?

373
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,882
l have a date.

374
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,717
Mr. Gilder! Are you lost?

375
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,248
No, ma'am.

376
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,260
Why don't you return to your own seat
and get back to work.

377
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,028
Yeah.

378
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,918
Arnie, stay here
so we can talk this over.

379
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,585
Mister, this is not a hotel
you can just drop into.

380
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,651
- l don't need this.
- What do you need?

381
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,927
- l need to leave. l'm late.
- You come back here this instant.

382
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,331
Oh, shit.

383
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,872
Greetings to you too.

384
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,708
Hey, man, no glasses.
You're lookin' good.

385
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,839
l can't make it.
l meant to call you, but l forgot.

386
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,245
ls Dennis going with you?

387
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,848
- Are you going with him?
- Am l?

388
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,951
No. l've gotta do an errand
for Darnell.

389
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:00,191
- You need a ride?
- Got his car. Thanks, though.

390
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,960
l'm sorry about the movie,
but this is work. Gotta go.

391
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,096
- Don't worry about it.
- Did you have plans with Dennis?

392
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,776
You are going to have no friends at all
if you keep treating people this way.

393
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,313
Get off my back!

394
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,286
You're his best friend.
What's going on?

395
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,750
l don't know.
l hardly see him anymore.

396
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,697
Neither do we.

397
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:41,295
Ever since he bought that car
he's been obsessed with it.

398
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,932
And you know what else?

399
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,340
When we signed the registration papers
at Town Hall...

400
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:52,276
they told us the man
who owned that car last...

401
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,513
died in it
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

402
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:02,158
Jesus.
Does Arnie know about that?

403
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,692
Arnie doesn't know anything anymore.

404
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,538
What the hell do you want?

405
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,582
l know about your brother.

406
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,480
l know he died
choking on exhaust fumes.

407
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,150
You don't know shit, kid.

408
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,752
My brother died
'cause he wanted to.

409
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,058
He ran a rubber hose
from the exhaust pipe.

410
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,123
Arnie wouldn't have bought it
if he'd known somebody died in it.

411
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,303
Either you're dumb or you
don't know your friend very well,

412
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,970
He had the same look
my brother always had.

413
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:57,136
Probably the only thing my brother
ever Ioved in his life was that car.

414
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:02,016
No shitter ever came between him
and Christine. lf they did, watch out.

415
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,721
His five-year-old daughter choked to
death in it. He wouldn't get rid of it.

416
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,819
He rode around without a care
in the world except for Christine.

417
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,625
Only time l ever interfered
was when Rita killed herself.

418
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,296
- Who's Rita?
- His wife!

419
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,862
He didn't care
a rat's ass about her.

420
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,204
She died the same way he did.

421
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,143
Then l made him get rid of it.

422
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,875
For decency, you know.

423
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,179
Of course, the car came back
three weeks later.

424
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,243
What do you mean, ''came back''?

425
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,818
Keep a-knockin', but you can't come in

426
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,293
Come back tomorrow night
and try it again

427
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,198
You said you loved me
and you can't come in

428
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,202
You said you loved me

429
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,905
All right. Fifty.
Pass on go.

430
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,914
Ready?

431
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,647
Want me to go deep or flat?

432
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,711
Flat. l'll hit you
on the second shot comin' around.

433
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,894
Hey, Trelawney.

434
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,372
- ls that Cuntingham's car?
- Yep.

435
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,509
l know where he keeps it.

436
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,387
Down...

437
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,091
set, go!

438
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,064
Fucking shit!

439
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,068
Get a stretcher!
Come on!

440
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,800
''5,000 Dirty Limericks.''

441
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,639
Ought to keep you busy for a while.

442
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,646
This is the third time
l've come by.

443
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,582
Must be dynamite drugs.
You're always asIeep.

444
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,586
Doesn't quite kill the pain.

445
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:42,355
Rockbridge hasn't won a game
since you got hurt.

446
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,223
That makes you a hero, right?

447
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,925
Did l tell you that l'm not gonna
be playing football again? Ever.

448
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,930
The doctor said that
one centimeter more...

449
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,066
and l would have been paralyzed
trom the waist down.

450
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,508
Shitters did some job on you, huh?

451
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,852
So what's this
about you and Leigh Cabot?

452
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:16,123
- We like each other okay.
- Ho-ho. Listen to Mr. Cool.

453
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,560
She just happens to be
the most beautiful girl in the school.

454
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,124
Well, it's not what you think.
l really...

455
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,260
respect her mind.

456
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,635
She lusts after my body.
What can I say?

457
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,139
Fuck you.

458
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,739
l saw you guys at the football game.

459
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,473
How'd you ever get that car
tixed up like that?

460
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,885
Oh, just plain
old-fashioned hard work.

461
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,047
l still can't keep her at home.

462
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,719
Mom says it makes
the yard look crowded.

463
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,059
l'm surprised they let you register it.

464
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,759
l told them it they didn't,
l'd drop school.

465
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,995
Are you serious?

466
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:07,510
They just don't want me to grow up
because they'd have to face getting old.

467
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,518
Has it ever occurred to you...

468
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,925
that part of being a parent...

469
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,190
is trying to kill your kids?

470
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,358
See you around, pal.

471
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,645
l'm sorry, Arnie. l can't.

472
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,605
What's the matter?
What's wrong?

473
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,176
l can't. Here.

474
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,489
ln that car.

475
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,727
What are you talking about?
Why not?

476
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,525
'Cause l hate that car.

477
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,160
You care more about that car
than me.

478
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,463
That's crazy, Leigh.

479
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,475
Who do you spend
more time with?

480
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:27,813
Look--
You're gonna get a cold. Come on.

481
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,709
I thought girls are supposed to
be jealous of other girls, not cars.

482
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,716
This car's a girl.

483
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,342
Oh, pIease.

484
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,520
Cut it out. Don't.

485
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:12,722
What? You don't like me
slapping your girl?

486
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,936
It seems Iike nobody
likes my car these days.

487
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,361
Oh, shit!

488
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,314
You're mine

489
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,218
And we belong

490
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:13,086
Together

491
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:18,423
Yes, we belong together

492
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:32,932
Yes, it belongs to only me

493
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,692
What the hell
are you doing?

494
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,863
Get your goddamn
hands off her!

495
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,798
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

496
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,634
You gonna be all right?

497
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,572
Yeah, l'm fine now.

498
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,011
You scared the hell out of me.

499
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,140
Then get rid of that car.

500
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,742
l'm not going in it again.

501
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,689
Wait a minute. Don't you blame
your choking on Christine.

502
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,692
lt happened, Arnie.

503
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,457
When l choked, something happened.
The radio came on.

504
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,830
- Everything got bright.
- So, what are you saying?

505
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,868
l could've died,
and you couldn't even help.

506
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,964
My door was locked.

507
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,009
You didn't want that man
to help me either!

508
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,637
l thought he was attacking you!
l could have done the Heimlich maneuver.

509
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,180
But you didn't.

510
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:23,378
There are other things.
That radio.

511
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,786
All it gets is those old songs.

512
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,916
Sometimes when we're making out...

513
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,120
it just stalls.

514
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,129
As if the car
were jealous, Arnie.

515
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,524
A goddamn car!

516
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,462
l'Il get it.

517
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,498
Know what l think?

518
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:48,442
l think you're just
sexually frustrated.

519
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,419
l'm sorry, okay?

520
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:05,054
Can l at least call you tomorrow?

521
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,604
l don't know.

522
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,099
Come on.

523
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:57,005
Come on, baby, please.

524
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,106
lt's all right.
Everything is the same.

525
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,856
I Iove you Iike I do

526
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,727
Don't know why I love you

527
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,324
Don't know why I care

528
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:27,703
l wonder why I Iove you like l do

529
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,540
ls it because

530
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:32,241
I know you love me too

531
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,005
Check this out!

532
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,362
Keep a-knockin',
but you can't come in

533
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:20,775
l'll just be a second. l just have to
get my wallet out of Christine.

534
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,053
Want to come in with me?

535
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,756
Please.

536
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:48,175
You know, l've been thinking.

537
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,804
Maybe we should apply
to the same colleges next year.

538
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,309
- ReaIly?
- Yeah.

539
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,479
lf we get accepted
by the same schools...

540
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:02,992
we could take it as a sign of fate.

541
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,290
You'd have me to help you
through math, and if--

542
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,025
Arnie, what's wrong?

543
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,722
Who did this?

544
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:29,205
Don't touch me, shitter!
This is just what you wanted!

545
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,440
You get away from her!

546
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,119
Arnie, l'm sorry.

547
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,349
Sorry?

548
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,857
Yes.

549
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:47,722
l--
That is, we--

550
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,492
It's your fault.

551
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,469
lf you hadn't been so damn selfish that
you wouldn't let me park my own car...

552
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,870
in your precious driveway,
this never would have happened.

553
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,466
That's not fair.

554
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,841
Oh, it's tair.

555
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,976
Can't we even talk about this...

556
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,985
like rational human beings?

557
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,749
One of them took a shit
on the dashboard of my car, Ma.

558
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,154
How's that for rational, huh?

559
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,760
Why don't we--

560
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:26,125
Your mother and l have decided
to help you buy a new car.

561
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,232
Well, that's what
everybody wants, isn't it?

562
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:37,239
Well, fuck you.

563
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,908
l'm fixing up Christine.

564
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:51,785
Listen, mister, you've been
disrespectful to us once too often!

565
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,261
You apologize to your mother
right now!

566
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,594
Take your mitts off me, motherfucker!

567
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,033
l'm hittin' the sack.

568
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,064
We'll make it better, huh?

569
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,641
Can't hurt us anymore...

570
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,147
not if we work together.

571
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,319
We'll show those shitters
what we can do.

572
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,427
Show me.

573
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,826
Little bitty pretty one

574
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,954
Come on, come to me

575
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,023
Lovey dovey, lovely one

576
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,625
UntiI l'm on my knees

577
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,001
ls that you, Cunningham?

578
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,208
Hey, you ain't mad, are ya?

579
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,621
Oh, shit.

580
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,230
You're a dead man now!

581
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,703
Where have you been?

582
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,472
You hear about
what happened to Moochie?

583
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,611
Yeah.

584
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:37,083
Almost makes you feel sorry
for the little bastard.

585
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,494
How's Christine coming?

586
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,229
Oh, cherry.

587
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,602
l spent a shitload ot money on her,
and she's perfecto now.

588
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,237
That's funny, you know, 'cause...

589
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,245
l heard she was totaled.

590
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:02,178
After l cleaned up the broken glass,
it wasn't so bad.

591
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,790
l bet you a hundred bucks...

592
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,183
it was Buddy Repperton.

593
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,962
Maybe.

594
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:20,264
So what if you fix it up and he
just comes back and does it again?

595
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,361
He won't do it again.

596
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,603
What does that mean?

597
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,109
Man, l gotta go.

598
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:32,875
l hope you didn't think
l could hang around here aIl day.

599
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,610
Yeah, that's you, Arnie,
aIways in demand.

600
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:38,752
Stay loose.

601
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,216
You know it.

602
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,920
Happy Thanksgiving.

603
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,473
Lean machine.

604
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:08,282
They let you out early?

605
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,509
Yeah, that's right.

606
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,186
l'm Rudolph Junkins,
State Police, Detective.

607
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,092
l'm just missing a study hall.
l got to get to work.

608
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,995
l don't care about that.
l want to ask you about your car.

609
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,627
You do nice body work.
l thought this thing was totaled.

610
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:31,272
- Who told you that?
- Why, hell, everybody.

611
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,901
Local poIice, your mom and dad,
your girl. Cute girl, by the way.

612
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,777
lt wasn't as bad as it looked.

613
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,285
The report said
they punched holes in the body.

614
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,287
Damned if l can see the fill.

615
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,550
You can if you look.

616
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,184
lt's right over there...

617
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,421
and back here.

618
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:57,125
l've been lucky with parts.
l replaced the entire door on this side.

619
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,963
- Yeah?
- See where the paint doesn't match?

620
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:06,406
Nope. A hell of a job, Arnie.

621
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,238
WelI, thank you very much.

622
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,002
So what do you want?

623
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:40,974
l really like this shade of red.
Didn't think they made this anymore.

624
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,238
Do they still make this shade?

625
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:46,110
Well, they must.
l bought it, didn't l?

626
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,743
- Where?
- Baker Auto out on Route 5.

627
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,220
- You still got the receipt?
- Tossed it out.

628
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:01,326
You know, it's funny--
Cigarette?

629
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,058
No, thanks.

630
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,295
Usually when somebody trashes a car,
we get photographs.

631
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,667
Wait. They didn't really trash it.

632
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,865
That's not what Leigh said.

633
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,138
She was so shaken up,
giving me all the details...

634
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,872
she broke down crying.

635
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,914
I understand...

636
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:24,680
one ot the perpetrators
defecated on the dashboard.

637
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,483
l would've thought you'd
be madder than hell at that...

638
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,423
and l would've thought
you would've reported that.

639
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:33,420
Shit wipes off.

640
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,665
Moochie Welch
kind of got wiped off too.

641
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,335
l don't know.

642
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,531
- You don't know?
- No.

643
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,131
Scout's honor?

644
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,976
l'm not a Scout.

645
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:54,177
The kid was cut in half. They had
to scrape his legs up with a shovel.

646
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,185
lsn't that what you're supposed
to do with shit...

647
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,448
scrape it up with a shovel?

648
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,115
Don't get smart with me, son.

649
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,393
Your girlfriend is
more convincing than you are.

650
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,663
She's not my girlfriend.

651
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:20,106
And since when is it against the law
to fix your own car...

652
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,473
when somebody eIse busts it up?

653
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,341
Since never.

654
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,348
Then you get otf my back.

655
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:51,271
l need to see you.

656
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,608
l care about you.

657
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,710
Look, l love you.

658
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,414
l think we deserve one more try.

659
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,250
Don't you?

660
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,794
Would you give me a yes or no!

661
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,796
Please don't do this to me.

662
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,833
Just be straight with me.
You've had it, right?

663
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:20,596
Well, fuck you, bitch!

664
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,482
Want to do the honors?

665
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,820
l'd love to bring her along.

666
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,480
Sure.

667
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:17,047
- She can earn her way.
- Bullshit.

668
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,923
Let's get Vandenberg.

669
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,488
Baby!

670
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:51,854
l'll never be your beast of burden

671
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:56,954
My back is broad
but it's a-hurtin'

672
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,864
All l want is for you
to make love to me

673
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,780
I've walked for miles

674
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,841
My feet are hurtin'

675
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:21,113
Asshole.

676
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,489
Watch this.

677
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,502
Let's give this asshole
some of his own medicine.

678
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,074
He's backing up too.

679
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,307
Some shithead's following me!

680
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,548
l hope he comes in here!

681
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,079
- ls that Cunningham?
- lt can't be.

682
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:58,653
Look at my car.

683
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,553
Come on, prick!
We're not finished yet.

684
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:04,689
Come on!

685
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:20,086
Hello, Henry? This is Will.

686
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,316
Listen. Cunningham get there?

687
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,559
The order okay?

688
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,254
Good.

689
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:30,264
Listen. He was driving
my Caddy, wasn't he?

690
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,427
Good. Yes. Take it easy.

691
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:09,903
Okay, Jack. Come on out.

692
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,770
The ride is over.

693
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,238
lf l'm gonna have to come in
and get ya...

694
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,011
l'm gonna get ya.

695
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,928
Why don't you do us both a favor.

696
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,766
Come on out.

697
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,767
l got a girl named Bony Moronie

698
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,643
She's as skinny
as a stick of macaroni

699
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:02,513
Oughta see her rock and roll
with her bIue jeans on

700
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,542
What?

701
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,589
Not very fat
Just skin and bone

702
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,224
I love her and she loves me

703
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:17,129
We're all happy now
as we can be

704
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:19,894
Makin' love
underneath the apple tree

705
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:26,132
Well, l told her mama
and her papa too

706
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,950
- What's goin' on?
- You tell me.

707
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,952
- Where were you last night?
- Home.

708
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,580
- What are you doing to my car?
- You didn't go out at all?

709
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:19,824
Of course l went out. l got Darnell's
car out front with a load of parts.

710
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,055
- You want the receipt?
- Yeah.

711
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,231
How come you're showing up just now?

712
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,971
Why didn't you unload
the stuff last night?

713
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,013
Because l was tired, that's why.

714
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:44,151
lf you don't believe me,
you can ask my mother.

715
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:47,154
Why do you keep
butting into my life?

716
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:51,682
Because we found your boss,
Will Darnell, dead in your front seat...

717
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,887
with a shotgun by his side.

718
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:13,909
- Why?
- l was hoping you could answer that.

719
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:17,179
Somebody saw your car cruising
behind Buddy Repperton last night.

720
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,550
He's dead too.

721
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,886
So are Don Vandenberg
and Richard Trelawney.

722
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,420
Guess nobody'lI be trashing
your car anymore.

723
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:30,494
Well, all l know--

724
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,833
l got a Cadillac full of parts...

725
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,998
and l'm supposed to be
at school in half an hour.

726
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,339
We'Il take care of the Caddy.
l don't want you touching it.

727
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:52,879
Honest, l don't know what's going on.
l swear l don't.

728
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:00,160
May l please speak to Dennis?

729
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,487
lt's a girl.

730
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:09,225
Happy New Year.

731
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:13,163
Can l come over there?
l need to talk to you.

732
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:17,105
- What, about Arnie?
- About Christine.

733
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:23,511
You first.

734
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,085
l'm afraid for Arnie.

735
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,785
l thought you wanted to talk
about Christine.

736
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,522
What do you know about that car?

737
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:38,794
l know that the guy
who owned the car before Arnie--

738
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,357
Yeah?

739
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:43,131
His daughter choked to death
in Christine.

740
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,798
How do you know that?

741
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:48,968
LeBay's brother sold Arnie the car,
and the guy's a jerk.

742
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:53,343
- He just came out and told me.
- l think l was supposed to be next.

743
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:58,017
Come on.

744
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,489
Arnie would never do that.

745
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:06,117
Not in a million years.

746
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:12,059
l don't think he's Arnie.

747
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:19,098
lt's that car.
l swear it's the car.

748
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,172
Maybe.

749
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,944
l'm going to Arnie's tonight
for New Year's--

750
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:28,107
- I wouIdn't.
- lt's okay.

751
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,584
We do it every year.
His folks are going to be there.

752
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:35,020
Maybe if l get him alone,
maybe he'll talk to me.

753
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:36,522
What if he doesn't?

754
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:41,623
- What do you mean?
- l don't know.

755
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:44,062
What if that car doesn't let him?

756
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:50,096
Then we destroy it.

757
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:25,163
WelI, come on
let's go

758
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,107
Let's go, let's go
little darlin'

759
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:31,145
And tell me that
you'll never leave me

760
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:33,544
Come on, come on

761
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:39,387
Well, now, swing me, swing me
all the way down there

762
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,321
Well, now, swing me, swing me
all the way down there

763
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:44,256
Come on, let's go, little darIin'

764
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:47,453
Let's go again once more

765
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:53,092
My man, you really operate
on those babies.

766
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:56,031
Yeah, l manage.

767
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,763
We got the old rust bucket tonight.

768
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:02,935
You wanna watch what you call my car.

769
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:05,275
She's reaI sensitive.

770
01:28:05,346 --> 01:28:07,644
ls she?

771
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,551
Sorry, Christine.

772
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,416
Good boy.

773
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:16,280
Let's motorvate.

774
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,262
Have a beer.
Don't be shy,

775
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,230
My car's your car.

776
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,671
A toast.

777
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,436
Death...

778
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,637
to the shitters
ot the world in 1979.

779
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,011
Come on.
l can't drink to that.

780
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:18,410
What can you drink to?

781
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:21,512
What about to us?
You know, to friendship?

782
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:25,650
Oh, friendship. Right.
That's real good.

783
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,213
Come on!

784
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:51,649
l want you to see this.

785
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:55,553
This is great alignment.
You just don't see this anymore.

786
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,158
Don't be scared.

787
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:09,163
l'm scared for you,
for what's happened to you.

788
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,829
lt's this fucking car.

789
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,631
l know you're jealous.

790
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:19,475
We'lI always be triends,
as long as you stick with me.

791
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:22,880
You know what happens
to shitters who don't.

792
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,214
No. What does happen?

793
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,714
Let's not kid each other.

794
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,214
Who are the shitters?

795
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:35,086
All of 'em.

796
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:42,693
Leigh's on your side.

797
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,762
- Oh, yeah?
- She cares a lot about you.

798
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:51,103
She does.

799
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:52,441
Yeah.

800
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,512
Don't you like this beer?
I thought you liked beer.

801
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,518
Did you hear what l just said?

802
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:02,612
Let me tell you
a little something about Iove.

803
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,454
lt has a voracious appetite.

804
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:10,327
lt eats everything--
friendship, family.

805
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,992
lt kills me, how much it eats.

806
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,830
l'll tell you something else.

807
01:31:14,902 --> 01:31:17,166
Feed it right,
and it can be a beautiful thing...

808
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:20,002
and that's what we have.

809
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:23,908
When someone believes in you, you can do
any fucking thing in the universe...

810
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,412
and when you believe right back
in that someone...

811
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:29,712
then watch out, world,
'cause nobody can stop you ever!

812
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,315
You feel this way about Leigh?

813
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:41,919
What? Fuck, no!
l'm talkin' about Christine, man.

814
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,396
No shitter ever came
between me and Christine.

815
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,490
Watch this.

816
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,366
Oh, shit.

817
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,645
Chicken shit!

818
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:09,883
Man, there is nothin' finer than being
behind the wheel of your own car...

819
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,059
except maybe for pussy.

820
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,222
lt's kinda spooky in here, huh?

821
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:54,218
Looks like they cIeaned out
the whole place.

822
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,058
Jesus.

823
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:02,066
That's where he used to keep it.
Down there.

824
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,229
Yeah.

825
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:08,499
You better get started,

826
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,361
Yeah!

827
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:34,196
What do you think?

828
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:38,528
Let's try it.

829
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:29,281
Christine's gonna come
through the door.

830
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:34,488
You better get in the office
and stay out of sight.

831
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:38,498
Once she gets inside, hit the button
and bring the door down.

832
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,467
Then we'Il have her trapped.

833
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,469
What if he doesn't come?

834
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,739
Christine will.

835
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:16,294
You better get in the office.

836
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:18,304
Keep your head down.

837
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:23,843
When you hear me start this thing up,
that's when you hit the button.

838
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,744
Leigh, don't move!
Stay where you are!

839
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:44,607
You shitters!

840
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:16,133
Oh, God.

841
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,209
Arnie's dead.

842
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:04,716
I'll forever love you

843
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:08,485
The rest of my days

844
01:42:10,324 --> 01:42:12,758
I'll never part from you

845
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:03,994
Are you okay?

846
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:06,833
l think so.

847
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,749
Rock, rock, rock
Oh, baby

848
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,768
Rock and roll is here to stay

849
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:38,100
lt will never die

850
01:44:38,171 --> 01:44:40,605
It was meant to be that way

851
01:44:40,674 --> 01:44:43,165
Though l don't know why

852
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:45,609
l don't care what people say

853
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,341
Rock and roIl is here to stay

854
01:44:48,415 --> 01:44:50,849
We don't care what people say

855
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,445
Rock and roll wiIl always be

856
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:58,389
l dig it to the end

857
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,949
lt'll go down in history

858
01:45:01,028 --> 01:45:03,292
Just you watch, my friend

859
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:05,957
Rock and rolI wiIl aIways be

860
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:08,501
It'll go down in history

861
01:45:28,088 --> 01:45:32,024
l wouldn't feel so bad, if l were you.
You two are heroes, you know.

862
01:45:32,092 --> 01:45:36,426
Yeah. A real hero
could've saved Arnie.

863
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:38,657
We didn't do so hot.

864
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:41,166
Some things can't be helped.

865
