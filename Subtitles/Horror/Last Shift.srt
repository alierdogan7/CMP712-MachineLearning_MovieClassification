Mom, I'm gonna be really
late, so I gotta leave--

Cohen:
How long have you been there?

36
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,699
I just walked in.
I'm Officer--

37
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,129
Turn around!

38
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,530
- My order said to report--
- Cohen: I said, turn around.

Sir...

I'm Sergeant Cohen.

Officer Loren.

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,235
- Loren?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,003
I... I was told to report here.
It might have been a mistake.

46
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,842
I thought the new station
is up and running already.

47
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,545

Oh, yes, it is.

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,343

00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,316

00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,819
And tomorrow when you see it

51
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,514
you will fall down
upon its steps and weep.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,887
But tonight you're here.

53
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,496
Sir, um...

54
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,201
I guess I don't understand
what I am doing here.

55
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,200
The real question is what the
hell am I still doing here?

56
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,394
But to answer yours,

57
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,509
you are the lucky rookie
to work the very last shift

58
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,336
in this mausoleum.

59
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,048
All 911 calls have been
rerouted to the new station,

60
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,117
so it should be quiet.

61
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,619
Okay, you may
have some walk-ups,

62
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,279
but just send
them up the street.

63
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,423
The address and my
number are on the wall.

64
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,754
If there's an emergency,
call the station.

65
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,962
Here's the kitchen,

66
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,436
and the waiting room down
the hall if you get bored.

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,276
That's holding, you don't have
to go down there.

68
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,539
Sarge, uh,

69
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,274
- can I speak frankly?
- Sure.

70
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,450
Why am I here and
not a security guard?

71
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,983
- Cohen: Let's go, rookie!
- Yes, sir.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,496
This room contains
enough hazardous material

73
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,761
to make Chernobyl look like

74
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,802
fucking bird shit
on a windowsill.

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,941
Tonight, every hardened
criminal in this area

76
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,008
will do everything in their
power to get to this.

77
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,975
And you will be the only
one standing between them

78
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,478
and the total annihilation
of this fucking city.

79
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,686
(Cohen chuckles)

80
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,082
I'm messing with you, rookie.

81
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,688
Oh... I know.

82
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,620
It's not in the
department's policy

83
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,123
to hire outside security

84
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,454
when we have a whole fleet

85
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,789
- of blue boys on the payroll.
- Right.

86
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,956
The only things left in
these cabins are some needles,

87
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,829
some bloodstained,
shit-stained clothes.

88
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,095
Basically all the
vile crap that we collect

89
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,863
from perps and crime scenes
that have made their way

90
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,804
through evidence and we can't
throw in the trash.

91
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,645
The material was supposed
to be disposed of yesterday

92
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,304
but for whatever
reason it wasn't.

93
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,642
So, Hazmat's gonna be here

94
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,446
sometime between
10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

95
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,555
Do not leave.

96
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,351
I repeat,
do not leave the premises.

97
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,790
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,692
I'll be back to relieve you
when your shift is over.

99
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,692
Any questions?

100
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,960
No, sir.

The scream sound won't stop now.

111
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,002
Okay, ma'am, just stay calm.
What's your address?

112
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,232

113
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,433

I just received a distress
call at the old station.

125
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,971
It was a possible 10-54.

126
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,667
I was told all emergency
calls were rerouted, so...

127
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,971
Dispatcher: All calls were rerouted.

128
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,637
Well, they weren't
because I just received one.

129
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,779
Dispatcher: (over phone)
ls the line still active?

130
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,008

that the lines have been

136
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,395
If there any issues,
I'll let you know.

137

149
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,508

181
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,363
that you can help
me locate you?

182
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,766
Anything that you see,
what's near you?

183
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,374
Monica: (crying)
I don't know. I think...

184
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,076
I think I hear pigs.

185
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,405
Pigs? All right.

186
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,740
Ls there anything else?

187
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,181
Monica: I have to go.

188
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,908
Monica?

189
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,879
- Damn it!
- (Phone ringing)

190
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,113
Monica?

191
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,913
Joe: (over phone) I think
I may have the wrong number.

192
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,456
This is Joe from
Bioclean Waste Removal.

193
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,752
Oh, no, no, no. I am sorry.

194
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,394
This is Officer Loren.
I was expecting you.

195
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,257
Joe: I just wanna give you
a heads-up.

196
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,898
We're running
a little behind, you know?

197
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,260
I thought we'd be there
sooner but

198
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,901
we're dealing with
quite a mess here.

199
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,401
Okay, so, what is
it going to be more like

200
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,697
four?

201
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,305
Joe: Yeah, you know, I'm not sure.

202
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,941
Maybe sooner but...
I'll tell you what,

203
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,132
I'll call you
back if things change.

204
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,709
All right, that's fine.
Thank you, Joe.

Dispatcher: (over phone)
Sanford Police Department.

208
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,487
Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

209
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,056
I'm calling again
from the old station.

210
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,886
I keep receiving 911 calls.

211
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,459
Dispatcher:
All calls have been rerouted.

212
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,652
Yeah...

213
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,298
I know, I called earlier
to report the same issue.

214
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,389
Dispatcher: Are you receiving
a high volume of calls?

215
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,126
No, it's not a
high volume of calls.

216
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,668
She's called twice.
It's the same girl,

217
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,827
her name is Monica.

218
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,405
She's definitely
in some kind of danger.

219
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,734
I can't get much information.

220
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,102
Dispatcher:
Did you get her last name?

221
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,432
Shit! No, I didn't.

222
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,010
But she said that
she is on a ranch

223
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,669
or some kind of
farm or something,

224
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,906
there's pigs.

225
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,607
Dispatcher:
Okay, she's not dialing 911.

226
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,276
So she has to be
dialing your station directly.

227
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,620
Okay. Well, can I trace
her calls from here?

228
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:06,813
Dispatcher: Yeah, I'm afraid

229
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,014
I can't trace
a call from that line

230
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,285
but I can
start looking into the pigs.

231
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,122
All right, what do
I do if she calls again?

232
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,160
Dispatcher: Tell her to call 911.

233
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,601
Got it. Thanks.

00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,555
Well, you've still
got that look on your face

362
00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,923
like you give a damn.

363
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,960
Have a good night.

364
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:04,561
I was here you know.

365
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,595
Yeah?

366
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,904
Well, the cell next door

367
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,607
but I heard the scream,

368
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,108
when they found
him the next morning.

369
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,910
What...

370
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,915
what are you referring to?

371
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,415
When they brought them
in that night

372
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,487
three of them,
this wannabe Manson family.

373
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,450
I think they were
called the Paymons.

374
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,726
Kidnapped and slaughtered
those poor girls.

375
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,789
Yes, they did.

376
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,427
They also killed
the Paymon family

377
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,589
on the scene of the crime,
the officers.

378
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,565
I should know,
my father was one of them.

379
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,431
Heck, that's what they
wanted you to believe.

380
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,630
But they brought 'em in alive.

381
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,469
Bragging about what
they'd done and all.

382
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,974
I can see you don't believe me

383
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,011
but I am willing to bet my
tits and a pack of cigarettes,

384
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,409
it's the truth.

385
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,739
Well, they kept me up all night

386
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,243
Singing this eerie song.

387
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:04,422
(Humming)

388
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,098
(humming continues)

389
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,306
Then it just stopped.

390
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,008
Those crazy bastards
hung themselves

391
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,805
with their own bed sheets.

392
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,845
Marigold: And the commotion
the next morning...

393
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,517
I got a glimpse
into their cell.

394
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,348
And the bodies were gone.

395
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,018
But...

396
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:41,160
pure evil covered those walls.

397
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:46,165
(Sobbing)

398
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,971
You Okay?

399
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,678
Yeah. No, I'm good.

400
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,356
Well, time to
make the doughnuts.

401
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,528
And don't worry I'm
taking my butt with me.

402
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,081
(Television static)

403
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,052
I'm not ashamed of what I do.

404
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,045
You ashamed of
paying your taxes,

405
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,088
taking care of your kids,
loving your wife?

406
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,419
I do what I do,

407
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,583
because it's right.

408
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,629
You ever hit the girl right in
the face with a baseball bat?

409
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,561
Man: We dress ourselves
in the cloak of ignorance--

410
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,497
She didn't even look
like people anymore.

411
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,165
Face swollen,

412
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,068
teeth knocked up
inside her forehead.

413
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:33,576
It got me excited.

414
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,905
She fell to her knees
and bowed to the king.

415
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,274
Dorothea: Are you suggesting
we are devil worshippers?

416
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,608
(Laughing)

417
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,944
Devil's just another
bitch of the Lord.

418
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,677
Rebel angel that was cast out.

419
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,188
Kitty: lam not ashamed.

420
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,585
Dorothea: But he is downstairs
doing the Lord's work

421
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,249
just like the rest of them.

422
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,160
Punishing the damned
for their sins.

423
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,796
That sounds like
the Lord's work to me.

424
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,633
But the answer is no.

425
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,264
We don't pray to him.

426
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:03,001
Devil's been around
long before that

427
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,970
clipped-wing cock-sucker
got down there.

428
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,366
Who do you think
was there before him?

429
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:09,868
(Whistles)

430
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:11,446
Dorothea: He just took a
break for a while.

431
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,813
Searching the world
for pretty faces.

432
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,442
Like me.

433
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,850
Kitty: Dead people are
always so messy.

434
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,050
There's so much blood
splashing around in there.

435
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,558
Make a couple
of holes and it just

436
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,722
- pours out.
- (John humming)

437
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,670
I once stabbed a girl
who sounded like a pig.

438
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,638
(Laughs and snorts)

439
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:40,833
(imitates pig)

440
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,011
I once stabbed a girl
who sounded like a pig.

441
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,240
(Laughs and snorts)

442
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,249
(laughing)

443
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,648
Dorothea: She fell to her knees
and bowed to the king.

444
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,254
That's what Paymon means,
you know?

445
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,719
It was destined.

446
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,885
(John humming)

447
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,360
The king of hell.

448
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,226
There was a family
back at the ranch.

449
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,768
But not at night...
not yet.

450
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,108
Paymon means soldiers.

451
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,344
That's why we are heading home

452
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,848
guns blazing so he can
take his rightful place--

453
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,541
lam the dancing flame,

454
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,379
a lightning strike,

455
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,754
crippling away-

456
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,287
I destroy your homes.

457
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,721
The ones alive
within your heart,

458
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,398
the ones you pray for.

459
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,533
I will rape your humanity

460
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,368
until forgiveness
is what you seek from me.

461
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,237
I like you.

462
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,115
I will come back for
you and all you love.

463
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,083
Mark my words.

464
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,785
I like you.

465
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,290
I will come back for
you and all you love.

466
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,496
Mark my words. I like you.

467
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,936
(Jessica gasps)

468
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:50,095
(phone ringing)

469
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,339
(ringing)

470
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,640
(footsteps approaching)

471
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,544
This is Officer Loren.

472
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,850
- (Girl sobbing)
- Monica?

473
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,884
- Monica: (over phone) They are dead.
- Monica, is that you?

474
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,113
They killed them.

475
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,654
Who is they, honey?
Who is dead?

476
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,115
Monica: The other girls.

477
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,021
What other girls?

478
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,495
Monica: You've got to help me.

479
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,961
Okay, Monica...

480
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,691
I can't do anything
for you over here.

481
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,701
I need you to hang
up and dial 911. Okay?

482
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,237
Can you do that for me?

483
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,307
Monica: They won't stop singing.

484
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,971
They keep singing that song.

485
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,640
What?

486
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,581
(Monica singing)

487
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:44,923
(Monica continues singing)

488
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,322
Monica: Hello?

489
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:49,927
I'm here.

490
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,825
- I'm here.
- Monica: Hey.

491
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,492
Monica, what's your last name?

492
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,595
Monica: (sobbing)
Young.

493
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,171
Young? How old are you?

494
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,936
Monica: (sobbing)
Seventeen.

495
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,869
Seventeen, okay.

496
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,276
Monica, I'm at a station

497
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,384
that does not have the
ability to track your call.

498
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,747
So I need you to
hang up and call 911.

499
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,048
Wait!

500
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,088
- Monica: They're coming.
- Okay.

501
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,692
Okay. Be very quiet and be very
still and listen to my voice.

502
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:18,884
Are you listening to my voice?

503
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,222
I need you to
go somewhere safe.

504
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,264
I need you to find somewhere,
where you can call 911...

505
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,923
- Nine--
- Monica: I can't.

506
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,198
Re-dial is all that's working.

507
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,900
Okay. Then you listen to me,
Monica.

508
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,632
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

509
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,435
You need to get
yourself to safety.

510
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,601
You need to find an opportunity
to run and you need to take it.

511
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,769
You need to run.

512
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,313
You need to run
as soon as you can.

513
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,710
Monica: Killing...

514
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,749
Okay. Listen. Listen. Listen.
I have a question for you.

515
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,887
Has anybody there
mentioned the name,

516
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,886
John Michael Paymon?

517
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,888
Have you heard that name?
Can you think and tell me that?

518
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,082
Has anybody asked you

519
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,556
- or have you heard the name,
- Monica: I don't know.

520
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:52,990
John Michael Paymon?

521
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,061
- Monica: I think so.
- You think so?

522
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,722
Please help me!

523
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:58,924
I'm gonna help you.
I promise you.

524
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,068
Stay on the phone with me.

525
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,328
- I'm gonna help you.
- (Monica screams)

526
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,439
(phone line disconnects)

527
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,442
(beeping)

528
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,259
(phone ringing
through handset)

529
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,427
Dispatcher:
Sanford Police Department.

530
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,096
This is Officer Loren
at the old station.

531
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,297
Dispatcher:
Yup, we spoke earlier.

532
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,171
Yeah, we did.
I got her last name.

533
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,811
It's Young. Monica Young

534
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,503
and she is 17 years old.

535
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,046
Dispatcher:
Great. Anything else?

536
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,684
She is not able to
dial 911 from her phone.

537
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,820
Also, she said that
there are other girls there,

538
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,147
she thinks they're dead

539
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,290
and she said her captors
are singing a song.

540
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,483
Dispatcher:
Okay. A song? Ls that it?

541
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,958
I think the remaining members

542
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,530
of the Paymon family
might have her.

543
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,530
(Man laughs)

544
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,997
Hello?

545
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,363
Dispatcher: Oh, I'm sorry,
you're serious?

546
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,027
I recognized the song.

547
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,729
Dispatcher:
Okay, slow down, rookie.

548
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,136
Look, the Paymon family,
they scattered

549
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,867
and they are under
constant surveillance.

550
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,971
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes.

551
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,376
Write this down:

552
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:25,919
John-Victor-lda-one-five-
two-six-three.

553
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,181
Okay.

554
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,346
Dispatcher:
You get any more information

555
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,686
you reference that report number
when you call back.

556
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,853
Okay.

557
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,361
Thanks.

558
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:40,160
(Distant whistling)

559
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,107
(whistling continues)

560
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:26,941
(door slamming)

561
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,085
(chairs creaking)

562
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,249
Oh, my God!

563
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,089
You guys are fucking with me.

564
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,665
All right, enough you guys.
You got me, all right?

565
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,301
The joke is on the rookie!

566
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,731
Ha ha!

567
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,270
Real fucking funny.

568
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,307
Yeah, it's real fucking funny.

569
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,242
Come out, shit heads!

570
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,159
You guys are a bunch
of fucking cowards.

571
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,419
Unbelievable.

572
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,527
You got me pretty good.

573
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,790
I got to say, you got
me pretty, pretty good.

574
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,862
(Buzzing)

575
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:25,638
(buzzing)

576
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:32,975
SQ?

577
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,507
So...

578
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,508
What?

579
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,280
Is it just you
or are there others?

580
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:40,649
Um...

581
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:41,983
No, it's just me.

582
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,649
Ha! Well,
that's real fucking mature.

583
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,193
Lam not following you.

584
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,159
Is this like your thing?

585
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,355
Ls this what you
do with your friends?

586
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,967
You put every rookie
through this little fun house?

587
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:54,159
Well...

588
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:55,998
I don't think that
we are on the same page.

589
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,397
I came over here
to check on you.

590
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,208
I'm Officer Ryan Price.

591
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,346
You're not, uh...

592
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,879
you are not fucking with me?

593
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:10,518
No.
I swear on my life.

594
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:12,814
Can I come in?

595
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,186
Yeah. I guess.

596
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,719
Okay.

597
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,196
So, first night?

598
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,327
Yeah.

599
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,492
How do you know?

600
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,935
Oh, just the blinding gleam

601
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,439
of your uniform is kind of
a dead giveaway.

602
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:34,906
Ha ha ha!

603
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,004
Well, you came to check on me
and you've checked on me,

604
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,548
so now if you don't mind,

605
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,583
I actually have
a lot of work to do.

606
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,186
Oh, yeah.

607
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,550
You seem super busy.

608
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,360
Wait...

609
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,053
was that, was that
like a frown smile?

610
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,857
Was that, like, a fr-ile?

611
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,430
All right. So what's your story?

612
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,299
You got the short end of the straw

613
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,702
or you just got really unlucky?

614
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,537
Excuse me?

615
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,903
Well, someone made you come
here and check on me, right?

616
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,241
No. I don't...
If you ask me,

617
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,542
I'm feeling pretty lucky.

618
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,611
Well,

619
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,983
to be honest, I don't
completely mind the company.

620
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,256
Rough night, I take it?

621
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,724
Yeah, yeah.
You could say that.

622
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,796
That sounds terrible.
What happened?

623
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,398
Well, let's see.

624
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,932
There is a crazy, homeless man

625
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,297
in holding as we speak.

626
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,733
He pissed all over my lobby.

627
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,500
(Ryan laughs)

628
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:40,904
It's not really funny.

629
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,506
It's... it's kind of funny.

630
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:45,670
Actually, it was pretty gross.

631
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,316
Gross? I once had a perp shit

632
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,315
all over the back
seat of my squad car.

633
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,748
Well...

634
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,414
You win!

635
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,925
Are you okay?

636
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,327
Yeah. I'm fine.

637
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:09,866
Listen...

638
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,373
honestly, when I found out
you were working this shift,

639
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:16,443
I snuck away to
come and see you.

640
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,115
I knew your father.

641
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,850
Were you with him that night?

642
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,647
Yeah.

643
00:47:29,814 --> 00:47:32,624
I was there when that
Paymon fuck <i>sh...</i>

644
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,624
- It's okay.
- No, I'm sorry.

645
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,059
No, it's okay.

646
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,063
I wanna know. They never
disclosed the details.

647
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:45,497
He and I arrived early
on the scene and...

648
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,537
we were ordered
to wail for backup.

649
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,645
But we could
hear these poor girls

650
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,377
just begging for their lives.

651
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:56,713
So we went in.

652
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,012
And they opened fire.

653
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,154
And I was able to pull out

654
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,260
four girls while
your dad held them off.

655
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,263
They killed six more girls

656
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,196
and two officers,

657
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,660
including your father.

658
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,572
He was a good cop.

659
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,200
And he'd be so proud of you.

660
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:27,539
Listen, I...

661
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,013
I really have to go.

662
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,574
You...

663
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,244
you really don't have to go.
I didn't mean what I said,

664
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:34,445
I'm sorry if I was rude.

665
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,214
- You can stay.
- No, I...

666
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,061
No... trust me,
I'd love to but...

667
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,792
If you need anything at all

668
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,763
just give me a call,

669
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,802
and I can pop right
over and check on you.

670
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,031
Do you remember my name?

671
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:52,401
Officer Price.

672
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:54,301
Right.

673
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,476
I'll see you around.

674
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,067
Officer Price?

675
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,581
(Whispering)

676
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,288
Girl: It's so dark in here.

677
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,255
- It's cold.
- (Laughter)

678
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:51,190
(screaming)

679
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,801
Man: Get down!
Fuckin‘ get down right now.

680
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:58,964
(Screaming)

681
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,105
Girl: (crying)
No, please!

682
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,675
(Screaming)

683
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,945
(whispering)

684
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:23,398
(shuffling)

685
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,709
(distorted screams)

686
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,973
Man: Help! Help!

687
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,940
Help me! Help!

688
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,410
Help! Get me out!

689
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,809
Get me out!

690
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,814
Calm down! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

691
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:50,043
Calm down!

692
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,277
What's wrong?

693
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,716
Get me out! Come on!

694
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,584
(Distorted screams)

695
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:58,821
I need to get out of here.

696
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:01,759
This isn't real.
This isn't real.

697
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,830
- Man: Get me out!
- This isn't real.

698
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,563
(Man crying and shouting)

699
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:11,798
Man: Don't leave me in here!

700
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,738

729

Cohen: (over phone)
Yeah?

730
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,501
Sir, this is Officer Loren.

731
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,235
Cohen: ls the place on fire?

732
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,464
No, sir.

733
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,767
Cohen: Are you dying?

734
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,602
No, sir.

735
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,476
Cohen: Then why the
fuck are you calling me?

736
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:07,609
I don't know.

737
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,316
Lam seeing things, I think.

738
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,314
Cohen: What?

739
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,351
Like...

740
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,288
I just don't know
if I can finish

741
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,927
the end of the shift, sir.

742
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,692
Cohen: Missy, if you can't
handle one night alone

743
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,334
in an empty police station

744
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,470
then I think you picked
the wrong line of work.

745
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,465
Apparently,
the apple fell pretty far

746
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,130
from the fucking tree.

747
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:36,278
So, should I inform the Captain
of your resignation

748
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,209
or should I expect to see
you at the end of the shift?

749
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,148
You'll see me at the
end of the shift, sir.

750
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:45,810
Cohen: Good.

751
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:47,953
And don't call me again.

752
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,165
(Phone ringing
through handset)

753
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,461
Joe: (over phone)
This is Joe.

754
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:02,126
Hey Joe,
this is Officer Loren.

755
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,703
What time you guys
are gonna be down here?

756
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,499
Joe: Lady, I'm knee deep
in shit right now.

757
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,972
Look, I told you, I'd
call you back if things change.

758
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,474
All right, well, I'm
going to be waiting for you

759
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:10,839
outside in my squad car, okay?

760
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,674
Joe: Yeah, whatever lady.

761
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:13,974
Thanks, Joe.

762
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:48,007
(Phone ringing)

763
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,048
(phone ringing)

764
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,929
(phone ringing)

765
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,188
Hello.

766
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,460
- Monica: (over phone) I escaped.
- You escaped?

767
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,293
I'm running.

768
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,370
Okay... okay.
This is good. This is good.

769
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,973
What's around you?

770
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,871
- Monica: Woods.
- Okay. What else?

771
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,103
Wait. There's a sign.

772
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,405
What does i! Say?

773
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,945
Monica: Carmichael Road.

774
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,276
Perfect. All right, is anybody
following you right now?

775
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,111
Monica: I don't know.
I think so.

776
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,310
Okay. Just hang tight, okay?

777
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,544
Monica: Don't go.

778
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:29,452
No, I'm not going.
I'll just gonna call

779
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,648
the dispatch on my cell phone

780
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,987
and we're gonna get a unit
over to your location ASAP.

781
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,424
Monica: Hurry!

782
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,063
You there?

783
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:42,431
Monica: They're getting close.

784
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:48,300
I'm gonna die, I know it.

785
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,768
You're not gonna die.

786
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,809
You're not gonna die.

787
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,581
(Monica sobbing)

788
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,848
Monica,
is there anything around you

789
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,424
you can use it as a weapon.

790
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,495
Monica: They are right next to me.

791
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,429
I'm here.

792
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,701
(Line disconnects)

793
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,001
Hello?

794
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:27,479
- (Beeping)
- Shit!

795
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,983
Dispatcher 2: (over phone)
Police Department.

796
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,376
Hello?

797
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,885
Sanford Police Department.

798
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:35,455
Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

799
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:38,026
Please reference
John-Victor-lda-

800
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,524
one-five-two-six-three.

801
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,027
Dispatcher 2: Please hold.

802
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,223
- Dispatcher 1: Officer Loren?
- Yes.

803
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,628
We spoke earlier
regarding Monica Young.

804
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:49,827
Yes, I have her location.

805
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,870
- I got in touch with her.
- Dispatcher 1: Ofﬁcer, she's dead.

806
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,474
What? No, no, no.

807
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,976
I literally just got
off the phone with her.

808
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,512
Dispatcher 1: No, she's been
dead for a year.

809
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:03,007
Officer Loren?

810
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:05,578
Yes.

811
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,348
Dispatcher 1: She was the last victim
of the Paymon Family Massacre.

812
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,082
Her body was found
in the woods,

813
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,056
beaten to
death with a baseball bat.

814
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,356
I don't understand.

815
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:17,397
I was just speaking to her.
I, I was--

816
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,926
Dispatcher 1: Look, there were
only three family members

817
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:21,158
linked to the murders

818
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,359
but there were
over a dozen more

819
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:23,527
living in the commune.

820
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,036
Maybe you were right.

821
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:26,401
There's a chance
that the calls are coming

822
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,406
from one of them.
Playing a sick joke.

823
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,541
Or...

824
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,876
Or what?

825
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,081
Dispatcher 1: This is just between
the two of us, okay?

826
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,281
Nobody likes to talk
about it in the department,

827
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:41,047
but it was
more than just rusty pipes

828
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,952
that got us
out of that building.

829
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,093
The Paymon family
wasn't killed on the scene

830
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,352
like the news said.

831
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,258
They committed suicide
in holding, and after that...

832
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,059
well, things started happening.

833
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:53,960
At first it was small,

834
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,694
like the lights
turning on and off.

835
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,805
Missing evidence.
Abnormal sightings.

836
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:01,608
Soon we couldn't
house perps in our own cells

837
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,039
without them freaking out.

838
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,201
The captain had enough

839
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,142
- and he pleaded with the county--
- I gotta go.

840
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,001
(Whispering indistinctly)

841
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:53,347

844
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:14,732
- (overlapping voices)

845
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,406

846
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,711
(overlapping voices continue)

847
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,948
(screaming continues)

848
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,483

849
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:03,748
(phone vibrating)

850
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,625
Hello?

851
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,730
Jessica's mom: (over phone)
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

852
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:19,965
Mom.

853
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,799
Jessica's mom: I was wrong
to bring up your father.

854
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,070
Oh, shit!

855
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:25,642
Jessica's mom:
ls everything all right?

856
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,138
Jess?

857
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,477
I gotta call you back.

858
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,845
Jessica's mom: I just don't
like how you say good-bye.

859
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,987
- I'll call you back, all right?
- I love--

860
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,319
Hey... hey... hey...

861
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,691
hey...

862
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:52,831
♪ (piano tune plays) ♪

863
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,058
I don't think you've realized
just how lucky you are

864
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:19,358
to be a part of all this.

865
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:25,532
How do I know this
is even really happening?

866
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,739
Do you see this
gun in my hand?

867
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:35,075
Maybe that gun
is still in my belt.

868
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:39,420
Maybe I'm talking to a wall.

869
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,213
Maybe I have gone
as bat-shit-crazy

870
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,552
as I think you are.

871
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,023
I could pull the trigger
and we could find out.

872
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,197
If crazy is being devoted
to something you love,

873
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,706
then I'm as crazy as
a slimy snail in a tin can.

874
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,410
I would do anything for him.

875
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,045
I'm a little
jealous that he took

876
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,846
those two bitches
with him that night.

877
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,581
Should have been me.

878
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:25,427
I forgive him.

879
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,265
I can never stay
mad at John Michael.

880
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,363
You need to give me
my fucking weapon back.

881
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,373
You need to shut the fuck up.

882
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:36,602
Okay.

883
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:42,206
(Doors slamming)

884
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,717
Have you seen
him here tonight?

885
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,581
You have. I knew it.

886
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:49,951
<i>He“ him.</i>

887
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:53,419
Tonight is the one-year
anniversary of his death.

888
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,453
And I'm here to celebrate it.

889
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,230

Who the fuck is this?

01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,338
Monica.

898
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,043
Monica is dead.

899

Jessica's dad: I missed you.

921
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,838
This isn't real.

922
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,213
Jessica's dad: It is baby.

923
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,682
I'm so proud of you.

924
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,216
You're just like
your old man, you know?

925
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,112
Strong, dedicated.

926
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,213

928
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,785
I did it for you.

929
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,096
Jessica's dad: Then why were
you trying to leave, huh?

930
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,897
I laid down my
life for this job.

931
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,798
I expect you to do the same.

932
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,765
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm really sorry.

933
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,931
I just got really scared.

934
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,135
I won't leave. Okay?

That's my Cuddle Bug.

Now, the man that took your

father's life
is still in this building.

939

do something about it.
