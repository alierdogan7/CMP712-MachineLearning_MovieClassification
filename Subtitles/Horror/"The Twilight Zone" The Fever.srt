1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,536
Hmm...Ben...

2
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:29,837
Mmm?

3
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:31,505
What do you think
you're doing?

4
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:33,474
Mmm...
this is a dream.

5
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,710
It's--it's a--
a beautiful dream.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,545
[Laughs] It doesn't
feel like a dream.

7
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:39,447
Oh, no, but--but it is.

8
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:41,882
I'm not really doing this.

9
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:42,883
Mmm.

10
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:43,918
Or this...

11
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,987
or this...

12
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:47,788
No, I'm not doing anything.

13
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:50,057
I'm sound asleep,
just like you.

14
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:51,225
Oh.

15
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,228
You're not sound asleep,
and this is not a dream.

16
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,863
Well, let's pretend that it is.

17
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:59,233
Ben, we agreed. No more sex
until we get married.

18
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,670
Right. Why did we agree
to that again?

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,671
-Hmm?
-Mmm.

20
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,002
Mmm!

21
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:10,845
It'll make
the wedding night special.

22
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,346
It'll be like starting over.

23
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:14,015
Well, let's start
over right now.

24
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:15,383
Hi. My name's Ben.
What's your name?

25
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:17,618
-Oh...Ben...
-What?

26
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:18,786
We're not doing this.

27
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,521
Didn't you give
Father Brendan your word?

28
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,356
Yeah. I--I had
my fingers crossed.

29
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:26,327
Oh. I sometimes wonder how
committed you are to all this.

30
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:29,063
-What--to all what?
-To our getting married!

31
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:30,398
I'm--I'm committed.

32
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:33,167
I--I proposed...didn't l? Hmm?

33
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,635
Yes, you did.
And very sweetly, too.

34
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:43,200
Maybe you could throw me a bone
once in a while, hmm?

35
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:46,547
Yeah.

36
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:48,811
OK. OK.

37
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:53,220
OK. No sex for six months. OK.

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,723
This is a test, right?

39
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:57,425
Yeah, OK.

40
00:01:57,425 --> 00:02:01,195
Don't worry, Samantha.
I'll pass with flying colors.

41
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,897
Yeah, if I don't explode first.

42
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:05,332
-Oh, you won't explode.
-Yeah?

43
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:06,799
Mmm.

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,268
Oh. Hey. Hi.
Oh. How are you?

45
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:22,305
Hey, uh--
Oh, hi. Excuse me.

46
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,007
Excuse me.

47
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,521
Oh, hey--hey there.

48
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,356
Hi--hi there.
Ho--ho there.

49
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,592
-l, uh, I work here.
-OK.

50
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:34,261
I'm the senior photo editor,
so if you have any pictures...

51
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:38,399
you'd like me to look at,
I'd be glad to, uh, to look.

52
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,889
[Girls laugh]

53
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,464
Have you seen
the women out there?

54
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,677
Nines, tens.
I think I even saw a twelve.

55
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,579
You and Samantha
still not having sex?

56
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,347
Is it that obvious?

57
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,483
I feel your pain, chief.

58
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,918
That was one nasty virus.

59
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:00,855
Good thing you backed up
your hard drive.

60
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,913
For you.

61
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,226
What's this?

62
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,760
The best sex
you're not having.

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,529
And it's absolutely guilt-free.

64
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:11,465
A virtual sex program?
Are you serious?

65
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:14,034
I don't need this.
I love my fiancée.

66
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,636
And you two make
a very cute couple...

67
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,638
but this has nothing
to do with Samantha.

68
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:19,540
"Sensuous Cindy"
is the greatest program...

69
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,108
Fantadyne's ever cooked up.

70
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,444
Fantadyne?
The--the game simulation people?

71
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:24,745
Samantha works for them.

72
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,580
I bet she didn't work
on this sucker.

73
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,249
How did you get ahold of it?

74
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,218
Easy. A friend
snuck me a beta copy.

75
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,286
-Really?
-Yeah.

76
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,655
Have--have you tried...this?

77
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,690
Hey, I don't kiss and tell.

78
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,427
Now, what is it, six more months
until the wedding night?

79
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,763
Well...

80
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,865
It's your decision, chief.

81
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:46,492
I like it.

82
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,811
Oh....wha...

83
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:06,448
What?

84
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:17,665
Ow!

85
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:18,825
Mmm!

86
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:21,930
Hi, Ben.

87
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:30,636
I've been waiting for you.

88
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,094
Sexual fantasies...

89
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,762
every one of us has them.

90
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:50,831
Harmless enough
most of the time.

91
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,833
On the eve of his marriage...

92
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,169
Benjamin Baker has decided
to indulge himself.

93
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,739
He's about to get
very, very lucky.

94
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,331
Or is he?

95
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:04,812
You're traveling
to another dimension...

96
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:08,315
a dimension not only
of sight and sound...

97
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:09,976
but of mind.

98
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:15,022
A journey
into a wondrous land...

99
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:19,152
whose boundaries are only
that of the imagination.

100
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,062
You're entering...

101
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:37,511
Oh, you taste great!

102
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,046
So do you.

103
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:42,516
How--how is this,
uh, happening?

104
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,619
I--I mean, how--
how does it, uh, work?

105
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,655
Well, I could
draw you a diagram...

106
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,885
but that might ruin
the mystery.

107
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,294
So, what did you
have in mind...

108
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:55,963
something naughty...

109
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,225
or something nice?

110
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:00,100
Well, l--l--I don't--

111
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,435
I--um...

112
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:02,736
Look at these curtains!

113
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,638
Amazing!

114
00:06:04,638 --> 00:06:06,740
They feel just like silk!

115
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,576
Did you come to play
with the curtains...

116
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,045
or to play with me?

117
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,379
Uh...

118
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,747
Ohh!

119
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:17,618
Why don't you just lay back
and relax and let me drive?

120
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:19,353
Uh...

121
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:21,422
OK...

122
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,824
Ohhh...Cindy...

123
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,159
I don't know
if I can do this.

124
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,794
This all feels too real.

125
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:30,898
Gee, Ben,
I'm just a computer program.

126
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:33,332
Yeah, some program.

127
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:37,938
You know, l--
I'm engaged to be married.

128
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,341
You are? That's so sweet.

129
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,675
Yeah.

130
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:43,777
You're not married yet,
are you?

131
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:48,146
Uh...no. I am not.

132
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,316
Then consider this practice.

133
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,662
Hey, mister...

134
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:03,430
there's a speed limit
in this town.

135
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,832
Oh.

136
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,734
Just kidding.

137
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,292
[Music playing]

138
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,945
I could stay like this forever.

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,889
Most guys are just
wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am.

140
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,158
Well, you know guys.

141
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,560
You're different.

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,629
You're sweet...

143
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,131
considerate.

144
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,832
I mean,
don't get me wrong.

145
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,567
You were a real tiger
when it counted.

146
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,900
Well, you were
pretty terrific yourself.

147
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,307
You're so sweet.

148
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,537
I could really
get used to this.

149
00:07:58,152 --> 00:07:59,380
Wow...

150
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,599
Ohh! Ha ha! It's you!

151
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,101
What's the occasion?

152
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,502
Oh, no occasion.

153
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:16,837
We're not having sex,
Benjamin.

154
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:18,705
That's fine with me.

155
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,441
And reverse psychology's
not gonna work.

156
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:23,544
What are you talkin' about?
No. Six months is nothing.

157
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,246
It's a drop in the bucket,
and, besides, like you said...

158
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:29,216
it--it'll make for--
for one hell of a wedding night.

159
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,451
-I love you.
-Do you?

160
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:31,718
Well, these flowers
weren't cheap.

161
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,520
-Oh, be serious!
-I'm being serious.

162
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,957
I mean, about loving you,
not about the...flowers.

163
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:38,625
You're the only man
I'll ever love.

164
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,718
-Yeah?
-Mmm...

165
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,724
Ohh...

166
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:46,733
Hello?

167
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:47,901
Yeah, he's right here.

168
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,037
-It's for you.
-Oh.

169
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:51,038
Hello?

170
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:52,706
-Ben?
-Yes.

171
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,741
It's me. Cindy.

172
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,276
Cindy. Cindy who?

173
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:58,245
Sensuous Cindy, silly.

174
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,614
I had such a great
time today with you...

175
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,350
and l--I can't stop
thinkin' about you.

176
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,085
Uh--it--Cindy?

177
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:06,787
Who--who is this really?

178
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:09,990
I told you. It's me. Cindy.

179
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,825
Cindy from this morning?

180
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,494
Just hearin' the sound
of your voice again...

181
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:14,661

182
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,196
Well, no--
But-butterflies?

183
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,464
You're--you're
a computer program.

184
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:18,699
Who is it?

185
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,501
Oh, it's, uh, uh--
it's, uh, somebody...

186
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,903
uh, from work.
Nobody, uh, y-you know.

187
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:25,405
Uh, th-this can wait
until morning.

188
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:26,773
We'll--we'll discuss it then.

189
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,243
Will you promise to come see me?
First thing?

190
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,477
Uh, yeah, sure. Fine.

191
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:33,881
Can't wait for you to hold me
in your arms again. It was so--

192
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:34,948
Is everything all right?

193
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,783
What? Oh, uh, great. Yeah.

194
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:37,851
Uh, so-something came up.

195
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,486
Uh, no--nothing r-really.

196
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,555
It's--it's, uh, something,
but it's nothing.

197
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,546
Every--everything's
under, uh, control.

198
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,889
Must've been a glitch
of some sort.

199
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,331
Whatcha doin', Ben?

200
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,566
Aah!

201
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,936
Didn't you make a little promise
to me last night?

202
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,306
I'm confused. Is--is--
is--is this part of the program?

203
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:36,209
Look, all I know is I've never
felt like this before.

204
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,645
Uh, l--l--I don't know
what you're talking about.

205
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:41,014
I'm talking
about chemistry, silly.

206
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:43,183
You know,
that mysterious attraction...

207
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,886
between two people
who belong together?

208
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,854
Pheromones
and all that good stuff?

209
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:50,724
No, no. You--you have to be
human to--to have pheromones.

210
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,260
Well, I was human enough
for you last night.

211
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,995
Yeah. Um...
w-well, why--why don't l...

212
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,331
come visit you,
uh, a-after work?

213
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,167
And afterwards will you
hold me for a while?

214
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,603
Well, y-yeah.
Uh, holding, uh, touching...

215
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:04,662
w-w-whatever you want.

[Telephone rings]

217
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:17,851
Hello.

218
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,353
Hi, Sam.

219
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:21,455
No, I had to, uh, work late.

220
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:23,590
I had a photo layout
I had to finish.

221
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,059
Yeah. No, I'm outta here
as soon as we hang up.

222
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,220
OK. I love you, too. Bye.

224
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:50,844
Ben?

225
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:54,054
I've been waiting so long.

226
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:55,856
Where are you?

227
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:57,289
Ben?

[Elevator cables screech]

229
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,876
Hey, there, mister.

230
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,935
Aren't you
forgetting something?

231
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:23,417
Cindy, please.
Start the elevator.

232
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,885
Not until we get a few
things straightened out.

233
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,823
Boy, when you sweat,
you really sweat.

234
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,227
Yeah, well, I have a thing about
being...trapped in small spaces.

235
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:36,363
So, now, Cindy,
I'm approaching meltdown here...

236
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:37,864
and it's not gonna be pretty.

237
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,633
Well, how do you
think I feel?

238
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,535
I mean, I can't eat,
I can't sleep--

239
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,737
OK, you never eat.
You never sleep.

240
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:44,805
I keep dreaming about you.

241
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,673
Look, you just said
you can't sleep!

242
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:49,643
Ben, I want to be with you.
I want us to be together.

243
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,546
-We can't be together!
-Why?

244
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,047
Because you're a com--

245
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,549
You're...

246
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,551
Ben, I know you like me.

247
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:00,887
Yes, yes! Yes!
Yes, like you! I like you!

248
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,056
But l--I love Samantha!

249
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:04,725
I'm OK with that.

250
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,560
B-but I'm not!

251
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,296
OK? It was--
it was sex, Cindy.

252
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,731
That's all!

253
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:12,566
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,868
I meant nothing to you,
and it was--

255
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:16,927
it was just a fling,
a one-night stand?

256
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,272
Well, yeah--uh...

257
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,041
I don't--I don't want
to hurt you...

258

but, yes,
you meant nothing to me.

259
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,545
It was just a fling,
a one-night stand.

260
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:27,979
I'm so disappointed in you.

262
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,460
Don't leave me. Cindy?

Help! Help! Help!

268
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,474
OK, OK, OK, I made a mistake.
A big mistake.

00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:04,384
OK, OK, OK, OK,

00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,585

what I was saying.

I just want to be
with you, Ben.

00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,102
Is that such a bad thing?

00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,900
No, no, no.
No. No, no, no, no.

to use the men's room.

00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:01,174
Oh, Ben?

00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:05,979
Where are you?

I know you're out there.

What, are you trying
to kill me?

291
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,892

the elevator?

-lt isn't safe. Nowhere's safe.
-It's 25 stories!

00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:25,824
Who's that?

00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,704
Hey, about how much longer?

296
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:32,072
Don't rush me.

297
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:33,473
I can't believe I'm doin' this.

298
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:34,574
This is a crime, a real crime.

299
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:37,410
You want to talk about a crime?
How about attempted kidnapping?

300
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,112
The elevator got stuck.
It happens.

301
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,914
I'm tellin' you,
she wasn't gonna let me out.

302
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:42,449
Would you stop talkin'
about her like she's real?

303
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,417
-You're weirdin' me out.
-Let me tell you something...

304
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,519
you know she's not real,
I know she's not real...

305
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,221
but Cindy sees things
a little differently.

306
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:51,091
She's a series
of ones and zeros.

307
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:54,561
Ones and zeros wrapped in
the cutest, hottest little body.

308
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,729
Would you stop it?

309
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:57,458
I feel guilty enough
as it is.

310
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,635
But not as guilty as I'd feel
if Sam ever finds out.

311
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:02,869
Sam's a software developer.

312
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:04,704
She'd probably think
Cindy was pretty damn cool.

313
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,106
Don't you get it?
We made a vow--

314
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:07,307
no sex until our wedding.

315
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,943
That means not with each other,
not with others, and not with...

316
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,711
some sex-happy computer program.

317
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,713
Your loss. Your loss.

318
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,916
I push this key...

319
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,150
and that's it.

320
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,311
Cindy vanishes
from your life forever.

321
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,856
What do you say, chief?

322
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,199
Terminate her.

323
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:36,795
Now.

324
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,016
Hi. I'm home.

325
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,506
In the office.

326
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,322
Hi.

327
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,090
-Tough day?
-Yeah.

328
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,259
Uh, I won't bore you
with the details.

329
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:01,061
Poor baby.
I know how you feel.

330
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,762
I'm having trouble
with my hard drive.

331
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:05,031
I can't access any of my files.

332
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:06,366
You want me to check it out?

333
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,501
Who's the computer expert here?

334
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,804
Well, a fresh set of eyes.

335
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,237
I'll open the wine.

336
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,774
Yeah...

337
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:16,503
Iet's see.

338
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,815
"Terminate her"?

339
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,818
Did I actually hear you say,
"Terminate her"?

340
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,787
No! You can't be here.
We got rid of you.

341
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,090
You tried, but I was hiding...

342
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,759
in the computer
in the office next door.

343
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,420
Having any luck?

344
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:36,930
Uh--oh, look...

345
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,666
no, the--the damn thing
it, uh, froze up on me.

346
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,768
Why don't we, uh,
pop some popcorn?

347
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,571
-We'll watch a movie.
-Wine and popcorn?

348
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:46,406
Yeah, let's stick a bag
in the microwave.

349
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,941
I'll--I'll see what's on.

350
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,535
Sometimes you can be so cute.

351
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:59,319
Why are you trying
to hurt me, Ben?

352
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,651
I love you.

353
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,891
I'll--I'll get it.

354
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,159
Yeah?

355
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,129
Maybe it's time Samantha and l
had a little talk.

356
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,964
No, no, no,
don't--don't do that.

357
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,932
I'll--I'll--
I'll come to the office.

358
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,534
Don't do anything
on my account.

359
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,603
No, I want to come see you.

360
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,304
We'll talk.

361
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:19,672
And once
we're done talking...

362
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,341
I'm a tiger, remember?

363
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:22,776
Grrrr.

364
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,611
-You are so cute.
-Yeah--

365
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:27,213
-Will you stay the night?
-Uh, uh, stay the night?

366
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:30,016
Yeah. Uh, sure.
Anything you want.

367
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,484
OK, but hurry.

368
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,781
No--I'm already out the door.

369
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:35,355
Ben?

370
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,956
I got some--
the office called.

371
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,958
There's a fire
I have to put out.

372
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,289
I gotta go.

373
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:50,737
Hi.

374
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:52,439
What took you so long?

375
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:55,608
Oh. What can I say?
Traffic was horrendous.

376
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,778
I was gonna stop
for flowers, but--

377
00:18:58,778 --> 00:18:59,946
Oh.

378
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:02,414
Uh, well, I hope,
uh, you like them.

379
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,441
They're beautiful.

380
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:26,106
What did you do to me?

381
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,675
Uh, well, that's--
oh, it's--it's a virus.

382
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,211
I--I stopped by,
uh, Garrett's.

383
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,379
He--he wrote it for me.

384
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,081
But why?

385
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:38,551
I'm sorry, Cindy,
but being with you...

386
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,179
made me realize how much
I really love Samantha.

387
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,424
That is so romantic.

388
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,726
You are so sweet.

389
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:49,388
Yeah, I guess, but--oh...

390
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,337
Cindy?

391
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,751
Hello?

392
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,586
Ben, are you OK?

393
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,255
Yeah, I'm OK.

394
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,890
Did you get the fire put out?

395
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,993
Yeah. Yeah, it looks that way.

396
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,294
I know it's late...

397
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,929
but could you stop by the store
on your way home?

398
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:23,963
Sure.

399
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:25,532
I e-mailed a list
of what we need.

400
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:27,267
The computer's working fine,
by the way.

401
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,802
Uh, great.
So, I'll see you soon?

402
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,437
No need to hurry.

403
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:34,440
No problem. Sam?

404
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,609
What?

405
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,178
I love you.

406
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,346
Me, too. Bye.

407
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:41,711
Bye.

408
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,531
Sorry I'm late.
I was dealing with my fiancé.

409
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:00,733
He's been acting
a little strange lately.

410
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,003
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear he was cheating on me.

411
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:06,306
Hmph. Men...

412
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
You can't trust them.

413
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:21,688
Benjamin Baker
narrowly escaped his fantasy...

414
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:25,458
while his fiancée
explores her own sensual nature.

415
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,360
A glimpse into the future
of modern romance...

416
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,795
for better or for worse...
