[Passenger] This is beautiful
county, but very isolated.

34

I had great difficulty finding
you, but I'm glad I did.

35
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:47,122
You see, we have had to close down
one of Mexico's biggest oil fields.

Several workers
have been killed.

37

Ah, we have
now determined that...

38
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,672
the men were killed by...

39
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,634

You mean...
there's more of them?

43
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:17,736
Yes. The company is facing
very expensive delays.

44
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,740
But more importantly,
there are many isolated people
who live in the region.

any amount of money.

would be a piece of cake.

one of these things?

if it was possible
to capture one of them.

anything else you need.

Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.

pretty nervous down here.

162
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:01,092
Glad you guys were willin'
to come all this way.

163
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:04,012
[Earl] It sure is in
the middle of nowhere.

164
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:08,016
[Grady] Well, of course.
Stuff like this only happens
in the middle of nowhere.

- Hey,Julio.
- Hey, Kate.

166
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,648
So? It's all done.
They're all working.

Yes, yes! Guys, this is Julio.
He's been setting up
the seismographs. Earl, Grady.

00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:22,447

across open county?

669
00:52:44,189 --> 00:52:48,318
[Scoffs] I'm not going six
feet from that seismo.

670
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:51,905
Come on. There's no graboids
anywhere near us right now.

671
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:57,452
Now, I say we go
while the going's good.

00:52:57,535 --> 00:53:00,455
[Grunting]

673
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,920
You know, you could
cary some of this stuff.

674
00:53:08,213 --> 00:53:10,131
I got what I want.

675
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:15,178
[Grady Grunting]

676
00:53:16,763 --> 00:53:20,225
[Grady] Well, I can't
say this looks good.

677
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:27,566
Pedro?

678
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:30,777
Hey, Pedro!

679
00:53:32,654 --> 00:53:35,156
Man!

680
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,701
This brings
back memories.

681
00:53:37,784 --> 00:53:40,370
[Panting]

682
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:55,135
[Earl] Jesus! Looks like somebody
took a can opener to the thing.

683
00:53:56,803 --> 00:53:58,722
Oh, man!
Look at that engine.

684
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:00,724
It's torn to pieces.

685
00:54:04,895 --> 00:54:07,480
Pedro!

686
00:54:07,564 --> 00:54:10,483
Damn it!
Where are you?

687
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:18,450
Hey! There he is!

688
00:54:20,702 --> 00:54:23,079
Pedro?

689
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:25,081
Oh, God!

690
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:27,292
Oh, God!

691
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:32,130
Whoa! It's a whole
new ball game.

692
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:34,216
A whole new
goddam ball game.

693
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:36,885
Well-- Well, you know
what to do, right?

694
00:54:36,968 --> 00:54:39,888
Right?
I don't know shit!

695
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:44,935
[Earl Breathing Unevenly]
Okay? Okay?

696
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:47,979
We can hike over
to that radio tower.

697
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,609
Th-Th-They've gotta
have a radio that's working.
We can, uh-- We can call direct.

698
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:08,959
1 4 May. 1 900 hours.

699
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:12,379
I've been out of radio contact
for several hours,

700
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:16,716
unable to reach Grady and Earl
or anybody at H.Q.

701
00:55:20,262 --> 00:55:23,223
The situation dictates
that I return to base.

702

[Air Brakes Release]

703
00:55:47,664 --> 00:55:49,624
A further mystery:

704
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:53,044
I've not had a single
seismic reading in hours,

705
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:56,756
yet I tracked one
of the sightless brutes
right into this valley.

706
00:55:58,133 --> 00:56:01,469
Where the hell did he go?

707
00:56:01,553 --> 00:56:03,471
They do get smarter.

708
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:05,473
ls it possible he learned...

709
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:11,146
to avoid the unique sound
of my deuce-and-half's
mil-spec engine?

710
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:14,941
I do not have the answer
at this time.

711
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:26,036
[Grady]
Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me
that's the radio stuff.

712
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:29,080
[Earl]
I can't believe this.

713
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:36,755
Oh, man!
Can't we ever
get a goddam break?

714
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:39,382
If we get outta here alive,
I'll count that as a break.

715
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:42,260
I mean, there wasn't
even any people here to eat.

716
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:46,348
They're doing this
on purpose, man.

717
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:49,226
They're cuttin' us off
on purpose!

718
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:53,396
shh! shh!
Quiet! Quiet!

719
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,316
I told you
they get smarter.

720
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:03,990
Hey, look.

721
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:08,620
Oh, yes! Yes!

722
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,789
[Earl]
It's not gonna have a key.

723
00:57:10,872 --> 00:57:14,709
So I'll hot-wire the damn thing.
I like that.

turn into that little thing?

Just like the big ones.

take this one with us.

scared me half to death!
Sorry.

762
01:00:55,597 --> 01:00:58,808
[Relieved Laughter] Oh, shit.
You know the radios--
They're out?

763
01:00:58,892 --> 01:01:01,144
I know. That's what
I've been doin' here.

764
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:03,647
I think the repeater towers
are down.

765

How can that be?
I don't know.

766

coming our way?

767
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:13,198
No! The creatures have completely
disappeared off the screen. It's weird.

768
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:16,910
With the radios all out,
shouldn't everybody come back?

769
01:01:16,993 --> 01:01:19,704
Yeah, everybody should have
been here a long time ago.

770
01:01:19,788 --> 01:01:22,624
I don't like this.
This is not good.

Okay, stay here
with the seismos.

our butts inside.

What the hell
we gonna do?

802
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:40,804
Get these windows shut!
It's like they got
the whole thing planned.

803

All right. How many
do you think there are?

01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:46,977
All right,
I remember. I remember.

805
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,939
There was three big sacks,
or bags, in that one
we saw split open.

806
01:03:51,022 --> 01:03:55,068
Huh, Earl? Can't be more
than three of those things
in each worm.

807
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:57,445
Yeah, I-- I--
That's right, I guess.

808
01:03:57,529 --> 01:04:00,282
Kate, how many big worms
were left out there?

809
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:03,660
You killed all but eight
graboids. I was watching.

810
01:04:03,743 --> 01:04:07,581
So if all eight of them changed,
that would make, uh--

811
01:04:07,664 --> 01:04:09,708
Twenty-four!
Twenty-four
of those things left!

812
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,544
How many have you killed?
Well, let's see--

813
01:04:12,627 --> 01:04:16,214
We, uh-- We killed
one on the radio tower
and-- and one out there...

814

and, um, on top of the car.

Well, I'm sorry.

826
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:24,324
I feel I was denied...

critical, need-to-know
information.

828
01:05:31,248 --> 01:05:33,166
Well, we're sorry, Burt.

829
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:37,295
They just changed
all of a sudden, man.

830

but they knocked out
the radio tower.

What happened?

832
01:05:45,178 --> 01:05:48,890
Well, when the radios
went out,

833
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,476
I decided to return
to the refiney.

834
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,856
But en route, I find
I'm in an ambush situation.

835
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,568
Must have been a couple
of dozen of these things!

836
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:05,282
I dropped the first wave
with semiauto fire,
but they just kept coming.

837
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:10,287
Most were in front of the truck,
so I popped it in six-wheel
and ran 'em down.

838
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,415
The ones that got on board,
I handled with a combination...

839
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:16,835
of small arms fire
and hand-to-hand techniques.

840
01:06:20,547 --> 01:06:24,467
I am completely out of ammo.

841
01:06:29,848 --> 01:06:31,766
That's never
happened to me before.

842
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,811
Well, shit!
Who cares, Burt?

843
01:06:34,895 --> 01:06:37,480
Sounds like you
killed 'em all, huh?

844
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:40,984
I hope not.
These creatures
are very important.

845
01:06:43,153 --> 01:06:46,448
You know,
I mean scientifically.

846
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:48,783
That fact was
not lost on me.

847
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:52,954
When it was all over,
I saw one of the little
S.O.B.s was just stunned.

848
01:06:53,038 --> 01:06:54,998
[Grunts]
[Growls]

849
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:57,167
So I detained him.

850
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:01,213
[Grunts]
[Panting]

851
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:26,988
[Panting]

852
01:07:29,658 --> 01:07:32,118
Oh, man,
it's drooling.

853
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:35,497
[Snarls]
[Both Yell]

854
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,541
[Bu rt]
Don't let him spook ya.

855
01:07:37,624 --> 01:07:41,002
That line
is 1 ,000-pound test.

856
01:07:46,633 --> 01:07:49,219
Go on.
Haul him out of there.

857
01:07:49,302 --> 01:07:53,014
[Grunting]
[Graboid Growling]

858
01:07:53,098 --> 01:07:55,016
[Earl] Hold on to
that son of a bitch!

859
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,018
[Kate]
I'll get the door.

860
01:07:57,102 --> 01:07:59,020
[Men Grunting]

861
01:08:11,241 --> 01:08:14,160
[Moaning]

862
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,342
[Growls, Chews]

863
01:08:32,846 --> 01:08:35,765
[Birds Chirping]

864
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,810
[Growling, Panting]

865
01:08:47,027 --> 01:08:49,779
[Tapping]

866
01:08:52,157 --> 01:08:54,367
[Growls]

867
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:05,253
[Growls Louder, Stops]

868
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:10,508
[Screams]

869
01:09:12,761 --> 01:09:14,888
[Growls Quietly]

870
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:18,099
I knew it.
Infrared.

871
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:21,061
It doesn't hear us;
it doesn't actually see us;

872
01:09:21,144 --> 01:09:24,231
it senses the heat
of our bodies.

873
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:28,276
See that?
The thing that rises up
must be the heat sensor.

874
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,278
[Heartbeat]

875
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:35,617
[Screams]

876
01:09:39,746 --> 01:09:43,291
[Screaming]
You feel that?

877
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:46,336
Gives off a lot of heat
when it screams.

878
01:09:47,712 --> 01:09:49,965
[Screaming, Growling]

879
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:55,554
That's it.

880
01:09:55,637 --> 01:09:59,015
I bet that's the way
they communicate.

881
01:09:59,099 --> 01:10:01,184
The sound doesn't matter.

882
01:10:01,268 --> 01:10:05,230
They make noise,
but they signal each other
with their body heat.

883
01:10:05,313 --> 01:10:09,192
It only sees heat?
Yes, that's not so weird.

884
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,695
A rattlesnake
strikes at body heat.

885
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,075
That's why
they tore up the cars--
because the engines were hot.

886
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:19,703
They thought it was food.

887
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,205
[Kate]
And the same thing
with the radio tower.

888
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,916
That electronic gear
puts off all kinds of heat.

889
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,711
So basically, they bite
anything that's warm.

890
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:30,505
They been actin' so smart
'cause they're so stupid?

891
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:46,855
Now, that's not warm.
How does he know to eat that?

892
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:49,399
Well, it tastes it
with its tongue.

893
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:52,777
See how he's draggin'
his tongue all over.

894
01:10:52,861 --> 01:10:54,863
Touches anything
he likes, uh,

895
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:57,824
he eats it.

896
01:10:57,908 --> 01:11:00,410
How much can he eat?
Those M.R.E.s aren't cheap,
you know.

897
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:03,455
[Chomping]

898
01:11:04,873 --> 01:11:06,791
[Burps]

899
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,752
Looks like he's had enough.

900
01:11:08,835 --> 01:11:11,922
You're feeding it too much!
You made it sick.

901
01:11:12,005 --> 01:11:15,175
Give me a break.
Probably your nasty food
made it sick.

902
01:11:15,258 --> 01:11:18,178
[Panting]

903
01:11:25,852 --> 01:11:27,812
[Growls Loudly]

904
01:11:37,572 --> 01:11:39,699
Oh, good God!

905
01:12:00,428 --> 01:12:02,389
[Screams]

906
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:05,642
Hermaphrodites.

907
01:12:12,816 --> 01:12:15,569
They reproduce
without having sex.

908
01:12:16,778 --> 01:12:20,365
I  claim the little one.
Hey, it was my food!

909
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:24,703
Whenever one of them gets
enough food, they just bla-a-ah,
and there's another one.

910
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:27,789
Then one makes two,
two makes four,

911
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:30,000
four makes eight--
It's exponential.

912
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:34,838
Well, uh, hell.
That gives 'em quite an edge.

913
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:37,591
You never see this
in higher animals. Ever!

914
01:12:37,674 --> 01:12:39,593
It's astounding.
[Baby Screams]

915
01:12:39,676 --> 01:12:41,595
Don't you guys get it?

916
01:12:41,678 --> 01:12:44,222
Oh, we get it.
We just don't want it.

917
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:46,224
The little one's
getting big already.

918
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:48,226
[Earl]
Uh, I think we better
think about leaving.

919
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:52,147
These guys have taken
a completely different
evolutionary path.

920
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:54,316
[All Screaming]

921
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:59,571
[Groans]

922
01:12:59,654 --> 01:13:01,740
[All Growling]

923
01:13:01,823 --> 01:13:05,869
They got into your damn
super-food, Burt!
[Graboids Screaming]

924
01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:07,871
Go! Go!

925
01:13:07,954 --> 01:13:10,582
Yeah! Yeah!

926
01:13:10,665 --> 01:13:13,335
[Kate]
The warehouse! We
gotta close the warehouse!

927
01:13:13,418 --> 01:13:15,795
- [Kate]
oh! oh!
- [Screaming]

928
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:19,674
This way!
Grady! No!

929
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:22,761
No! Not that way!
Grady!

930
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:26,389
Grady, damn it!

931
01:13:26,473 --> 01:13:29,768
[Earl]
All right! All right!
This isn't gonna work.

932
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:32,395
[Guys]
Shit!

933
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:35,398
[Growling]

934
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,577
[Panting]
They stopped.

935
01:13:47,661 --> 01:13:50,956
They're just milling around.

936
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:53,833
Looks like they
lost track of us.
That's not gonna last.

937
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,547
We're like
sittin' ducks here!

938
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,091
Well, it looked like
a goddam building!

939
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:05,762
Why didn't you listen to me?
These little snappers
are blind and deaf.

940
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:07,889
We've gotta
be able to beat them.

941
01:14:21,778 --> 01:14:23,697
[Growling]

942
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:37,627
I told ya,
they can't see us.

943
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:40,839
Great, now what?
Now, move with me.

944
01:14:40,922 --> 01:14:43,133
Move?

945
01:14:43,216 --> 01:14:46,511
It's gonna work, damn it.
Now move! And step, and step,

946
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:51,391
and step and step--
I don't know how you
come up with this shit.

947
01:14:51,474 --> 01:14:53,977
I think on my feet.

948
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,979
Come on! It's working.

949
01:14:56,062 --> 01:15:00,108
Comin' at ya.
Okay. All right.

950
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:02,569
And down.

951
01:15:13,163 --> 01:15:16,333
So...

952
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:19,127
where are we going?

953
01:15:20,587 --> 01:15:22,505
Are there
any more cars left?

954
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,674
Um, uh, yeah.

955
01:15:24,758 --> 01:15:28,803
One. Julio's.
It's by the storage tank.

956
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:32,057
- Which way?
- Left. Move left.

957
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,436
Okay. Ready and moving left,

958
01:15:36,519 --> 01:15:41,191
and step, and step, and step,

959
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:43,985
and step and step.

960
01:15:49,324 --> 01:15:51,284
Okay, it's
not much further.

961
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:55,288
oh!

962
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,459
[Kate]
There's one
of them out there!

963
01:15:59,543 --> 01:16:02,462
Oh, shit!
Did it see you?

964
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:06,675
Well, if it had, I think
we'd be hearing about it by now.

965
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:08,677
How far is it?

966
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,304
Uh, uh, 100 yards about.

967
01:16:11,388 --> 01:16:14,266
[Earl]
That's a heck of a shot.

968
01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:16,560
Uh-huh.

969
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:19,729
Whoa! You got
only one shot?
Then you gotta hit it...

970
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:24,401
before it sends one of those
heat signals to the others.

971
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:26,653
I know.

972
01:16:33,785 --> 01:16:35,704
Cover your ears.

973
01:16:39,499 --> 01:16:44,004
[Growling Get Louder]

974
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,510
Oh,Jesus.

01:16:52,262 --> 01:16:54,472
Jesus!

976
01:16:54,556 --> 01:16:57,976
God! You smoked his ass.

977
01:16:58,059 --> 01:17:01,313
Doin' what I can with what I got.
Good.

978
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:13,533
[Earl]
Oh, shit, partner.

979
01:17:17,621 --> 01:17:19,581

Oh, no! Pop the hood.

Damn!

We're dead.

983
01:17:32,802 --> 01:17:34,888
What?

984
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,265
I didn't know.
How could I've known?

985
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:43,480
We're supposed to be
up against graboids!
I wanted maximum penetration.

986
01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:45,815
- Well, you've got it.
- [Kate]
Now what?

987
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:49,069
[Earl]
We can't stay here.
We've got to get inside.

01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:52,113

Burt, it's working; they can't find you.
Don't move.

This is pathetic!

got a plan, I think!

01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:12,045
[Growls]

1012
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:17,092
Ow! Ow!
Shit! Ouch!

1013
01:20:18,426 --> 01:20:23,014
That's great!
Uh, here. Here.

1014
01:20:24,808 --> 01:20:26,726
Get ready to run.

1015
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,312
We're gonna head for those
oil towers and climb.

1016
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:31,314
[Growling]

1017
01:20:32,649 --> 01:20:34,818
[Screaming]

1018
01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:47,581
Yes! Earl,
you're a genius.

1019
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,836
Come on!
It's clear. Hurry.

1020
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,967
You're okay.
They can't climb.

1021
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:01,386
Watch your shin.
Oh, man!

1022
01:21:01,469 --> 01:21:04,890
They can't climb.
Pretty slick, my man.

1023
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:07,225
Slick?
That was brilliant.

1024
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:09,519
You really do think
on your feet, don't you?

1025
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,521
Yeah, well.

1026
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:14,691
Hey, where's Burt?

1027
01:21:14,774 --> 01:21:18,820
Oh, over here.
And don't worry, they can't
even find him in there.

1028
01:21:18,904 --> 01:21:21,865
Oh, man.
I think he's gonna
be okay for now.

1029
01:21:21,948 --> 01:21:24,451
[Growls, Screams]

1030
01:21:27,412 --> 01:21:30,081
Oh, I'm just dandy!

1031
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:32,500
So what do we do now?

1032
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:38,215
Hey, Burt!

1033
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:42,302
Are you sure you don't
have any more bullets?
Did you check all your pockets?

1034
01:21:44,387 --> 01:21:50,060
You know, as I lie here,
I can't help but comment:

1035
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:55,106
The reason I am out
of nine millimetre rounds
is I was not properly briefed.

1036
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:59,694
And the reason
for that is this mission
was not properly researched.

1037
01:21:59,778 --> 01:22:03,657
If certain people had bothered
to gather intelligence
on the creatures...

1038
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:06,076
before bumbling
into the situation--

1039
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:09,371
Knock it off, Burt!
Nobody made you come.

1040
01:22:09,454 --> 01:22:14,334
when we should be packing
full-auto, preferably belt-fed!

1041
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:17,379
[Snorting]
Shut up!

1042
01:22:17,462 --> 01:22:23,051
They're Precambrian life forms.
How's anybody supposed to
research Precambrian life?

1043
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:25,595
What difference
does it make now?

1044
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,558
We're stuck on a goddam roof
with a bunch of whatsits
tying to eat us.

1045
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:32,435
I've done this before,
and I did not like it.

1046
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:37,148
Okay. It's all my fault!
So things didn't work out
exactly the way we planned.

1047
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,401
If I had the right tools,
I'd finish the job!

1048
01:22:39,484 --> 01:22:42,988
Jeez! Would you
just all relax?

1049
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:48,118
Now, look. Nobody's
heard from us since last night,

1050
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:52,956
which means pretty soon
they're going to be up here
looking for us, right?

1051
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:58,378
So all we have to do
is sit and wait. Okay?

1052
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:04,092
Burt?

1053
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:05,927
[Growling]

1054
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:09,222
Okay.

1055
01:23:13,143 --> 01:23:15,437
[Growling]

1056
01:23:22,986 --> 01:23:25,155
[Graboids Screaming]

1057
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:27,866
[Screaming]

1058
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:41,171
So I figured I wanted to learn
some Spanish, and six months in
Mexico would be an adventure.

1059
01:23:41,254 --> 01:23:43,215
[Laughs]

1060
01:23:46,092 --> 01:23:49,095
So, uh--
[Sighs]

1061
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,098
Seeing anybody?

1062
01:23:57,896 --> 01:24:01,066
Not since
the monsters arrived.
[Laughs]

1063
01:24:01,149 --> 01:24:05,487
[Exhales]
Well, you know, you...

1064
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:09,199
spend a couple of days
almost getting killed,
you start, uh,

1065
01:24:09,282 --> 01:24:11,493
thinking about your future
and--

1066
01:24:11,576 --> 01:24:14,412
Thinking you
should date more?

1067
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:17,123
Well, uh,
yeah, actually.

1068
01:24:17,207 --> 01:24:19,125
[Both Laugh]

1069
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:22,045
Uh, look, uh,

1070
01:24:22,128 --> 01:24:26,049
I just don't meet that many
women who can keep their cool...

1071
01:24:26,132 --> 01:24:28,176
in a situation like this.

1072
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:35,100
What I mean is that, uh--
What matters to me is that
a woman can handle herself.

1073
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:37,185
It's much more important
than what she looks like.

1074
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:41,147
Thanks a lot. Aw, come on!
You look great.

1075
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:46,069
Enough guys have told you that.
Yeah, well.

1076
01:24:46,152 --> 01:24:49,072
Believe it or not, I made my living
as a model once upon a time.

1077
01:24:49,155 --> 01:24:51,074
I put myself
through college.

1078
01:24:51,157 --> 01:24:53,243
I believe it.
I was a--

1079
01:24:53,326 --> 01:24:57,122
I was even a Playmate once.

1080
01:24:57,205 --> 01:25:01,042
About gave my dad
a heart attack.

1081
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:07,257
What?
October '74?

1082
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,635
Shit!

1083
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:14,180
[Clears Throat]

1084
01:25:17,142 --> 01:25:19,436
Yup!
[Laughs]

1085
01:25:20,145 --> 01:25:23,231
Uh, guys. Guys!

1086
01:25:23,315 --> 01:25:27,402
[Growling] Oh, my God.
Look at that.

1087
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:37,120
Goddam little...
heat seekers.

1088
01:25:37,204 --> 01:25:40,290
[Grady] What do we do, Earl?
You gotta stop asking me?

1089
01:25:40,373 --> 01:25:43,919
I don't know!
What's goin' on?

1090
01:25:44,002 --> 01:25:45,921
What's happening?

1091
01:25:56,389 --> 01:25:58,308
Uh-oh.

1092
01:26:00,352 --> 01:26:03,271
Smart little bastards.

1093
01:26:03,355 --> 01:26:05,273
Whoa! Oh!

1094
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:20,956
Come get me, you suckers!
You hungry?

1095
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:24,000
- A hundred and eighty-five
pounds of lean meat.
- Burt, what are you doing?

1096
01:26:24,084 --> 01:26:26,002
You know you want it!

1097
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:28,004
[Growling, Screaming]

1098
01:26:28,088 --> 01:26:30,715
Burt!
Burt!

1099
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:35,887
What is wrong with him?
Has he got a plan?

1100
01:26:35,971 --> 01:26:39,474
Burt's always got a plan...
usually.

1101
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,193
Yes!

1102
01:26:57,117 --> 01:26:59,035
Problem solved.

1103
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,497
- [Cheering]
- You maniac!

1104
01:27:02,581 --> 01:27:04,708
Who-oo! Oh, Burt, you did it?

1105
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:07,127
You tricked
the little plug uglies!

1106
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:10,589
How's it feel
to be so stupid?

1107
01:27:12,632 --> 01:27:14,801
[Earl]
Who-oo!

1108
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:17,387
[Graboids Screaming]

1109
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:21,516
Oh, Christ!
Did they find something to eat?

1110
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,396
- Uh, what's in there, Kate?
- I don't know--
boxes, supplies.

1111
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:29,733
Golosinas--
Dulce.

1112
01:27:29,816 --> 01:27:32,903
Hell, uh--
Dulce. Dulce.

1113
01:27:32,986 --> 01:27:36,531
Sweet! Golosinas--
I know this one. Snack.

1114
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:40,160
Sweet snack food?

1115
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:42,370
Rice flour.

1116
01:27:42,746 --> 01:27:46,124
I didn't know!
How could I've had known?
[Graboids Screaming]

1117
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,752
God! Don't they ever get tired of eating?
[Grady] There'll be 100 of 'em.

1118
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:51,546
Okay, we're gonna run for it!
[Grady] What?

1119
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,673
Where?
We're not gonna make it!

1120
01:27:53,757 --> 01:27:57,260
[Graboids Screaming, Growling]
Look? Earl, I'm sorry.

1121
01:27:57,344 --> 01:28:00,096
I'm sorry I got you all into this.
Come on, Grady.

1122
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:03,141
We ain't dead yet.

1123
01:28:05,727 --> 01:28:08,396
Okay! Come on!

1124
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,565
Okay, what, what,
what, what, okay?

1125
01:28:10,649 --> 01:28:13,068
Uh, I've got a plan!
Sorta.

1126
01:28:16,655 --> 01:28:18,698
You're gonna
squirt me with this.

1127
01:28:18,782 --> 01:28:21,826
- That's great! It'll make you cold.
- Right. They won't see me.

1128
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,746
Says who? No, they're
right; it oughta work.

1129
01:28:24,829 --> 01:28:26,998
For how long?
Well, we gotta try something!

1130
01:28:27,082 --> 01:28:32,337
- But what is the point?
- If I can just get to your
truck, I can grab some bombs.

1131
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:36,091
- This is nuts!
- Well, yeah, and--

1132
01:28:36,174 --> 01:28:38,510
Let me do it!
It was my idea!

1133
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:42,639
No, I got you all into this.
It's my fault.
I'm going in. Spray me!

1134
01:28:42,722 --> 01:28:46,434
We gotta do it
before they break out.
Now, blast me!

1135
01:28:47,852 --> 01:28:50,897
Oh,Jesus!

1136
01:28:50,981 --> 01:28:53,900
- Yes!
- No! Rock rips through paper.

1137
01:28:53,984 --> 01:28:57,904
Huh! I go! Give me that shirt.
I need the gloves too.

1138
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:02,701
You ready?
Here goes.

1139
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:22,512
Man, this stuff is cold!

1140
01:29:22,596 --> 01:29:24,556
Okay, here goes.

1141
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,475
Lock this door behind me.
Lock it?

1142
01:29:27,559 --> 01:29:31,730
Yeah. I'll get the bombs
and go out the other door.

1143
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:33,857
All right.

1144
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,902
[Growling]

1145
01:29:38,069 --> 01:29:41,072
[Snorting]

1146
01:29:44,242 --> 01:29:46,161
[Growls]

1147
01:29:57,672 --> 01:29:59,633
[Growling]

1148
01:30:11,686 --> 01:30:14,022
Sounds like it's working.

1149
01:30:18,276 --> 01:30:20,862
I can't see anything.
Over here.

1150
01:30:20,946 --> 01:30:23,865
[Growling Continues]

1151
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,835
Here!

1152
01:30:37,045 --> 01:30:39,756
Holy tamole!
There's dozens of 'em.

1153
01:30:39,839 --> 01:30:41,758
Good Lord.

1154
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:47,180
Wait a minute!
Paperwraps rock, doesn't it?

1155
01:30:47,264 --> 01:30:50,475
Paper _lw__s wraps rock.

1156
01:30:50,559 --> 01:30:52,727
Damn!

1157
01:31:01,528 --> 01:31:04,698
He's startin' to melt!
Earl, you're melting?

1158
01:31:04,781 --> 01:31:08,660
Step on it!
Come on! Go, go, go!

1159
01:31:19,004 --> 01:31:21,965
[Screaming]

1160
01:31:22,048 --> 01:31:24,175
Damn! They see him.

1161
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:29,764
Uh... rope!
We need rope or something.

1162
01:31:29,848 --> 01:31:33,018
Hang on, Earl!
A hose! There's a hose
down by the fire hydrant.

1163
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:47,532
[Grunting]

1164
01:31:50,285 --> 01:31:52,454
Here you go.

1165
01:31:56,583 --> 01:31:59,169
Ah! It's too short!

1166
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:03,006
[Beeping]

1167
01:32:03,089 --> 01:32:05,300
[Screaming]

1168
01:32:08,762 --> 01:32:11,473
[Grady] Did you hear me?
The hose is too short.

1169
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:13,808
Burt, hurry!

1170
01:32:15,727 --> 01:32:18,647
[Growling]

1171
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:23,151
[Grunting]

1172
01:32:24,277 --> 01:32:26,321
oh!

1173
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:33,286
- [All Screaming]
- Heads up, Earl!
Grab it! Come on!

1174
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:42,087
[All Screaming]

1175
01:32:45,215 --> 01:32:48,552
Go! Run! Run! Go!
I set a bomb.

1176
01:32:48,635 --> 01:32:51,972
What? It's the only

a little crazy.
