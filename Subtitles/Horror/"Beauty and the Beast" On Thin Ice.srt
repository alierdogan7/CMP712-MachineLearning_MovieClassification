1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:02,906
CATHERINE: <i>Nine years ago I witnessed</i>
<i>my mother's murder.</i>

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:06,749
<i>I would've been killed, too,</i>
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:09,367
VINCENT: <i>I was part of an experimental</i>
<i>Special Forces group.</i>

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:12,687
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,739
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

6
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:15,940
You're him.

7
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:20,461
<i>Being in any relationship,</i>
<i>it's a risk.</i>

8
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:23,298
Dr. Forbes, it's about
something that you wrote.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,532
That was years ago.

10
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:27,468
I have evidence that a
cross-species creature exists.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,220
I could do with a biochemist.

12
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:31,689
I'd include you in all
aspects of the investigation.

13
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:34,175
CATHERINE:
<i>My nurse, you might know her?</i>

14
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:35,476
We grew up together.

15
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:36,894
We were pretty close.

16
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:37,895
They said you were dead.

17
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:39,697
You should've
just given up on me.

18
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,517
ALEX:
<i>I loved you.</i>

19
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,103
CATHERINE:
Maybe I've been misreading us.

20
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:51,442
(panting)

21
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:55,496
(knock on door)

22
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,065
Hi.

23
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,567
Hey.

24
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,402
Remind me never
to get shot again.

25
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:02,453
Never get shot again.

26
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,505
Come in.

27
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,908
Thanks.

28
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,578
Now put the
dumbbell down.

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,246
Why do I get
the feeling

30
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:14,098
that this is going
to hurt even worse?

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,351
Give me your hands.
Come on.

32
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:18,186
You need to work
on your flexibility.

33
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:19,604
(laughing): I don't remember
asking you

34
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,922
to be my personal
physical therapist.

35
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,775
Okay.
Okay.

36
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:25,727
Slightly back, that's it.
Okay.

37
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,030
Careful.

38
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,365
You know, the first time
I got shot in Afghanistan,

39
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,616
I couldn't sleep for months.

40
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,036
Yeah, it's like
I'm sleepwalking.

41
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,437
I can't do anything,

42
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,039
and they've got me
on restrictive duty

43
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,242
until I am physically
and emotionally up to par.

44
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:42,660
(phone ringing)

45
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:45,663
And, again.

46
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,415
You want to
answer that?

47
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:50,651
Uh, no, it's okay.
I'll call her back.

48
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,087
Ah, it's Alex.

49
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,173
Really, Vincent,
it's okay.

50
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,141
I don't mind.

51
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,010
Uh, okay, thanks.

52
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:00,478
Oh...

53
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,401
Look, uh...

54
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:07,819
Catherine,
the thing is...

55
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:09,303
You... you don't
have to explain.

56
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:11,406
She was your fiancée.

57
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:14,942
You were planning
a life together for years.

58
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,561
Six years
and an entire childhood.

59
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:21,115
But... you and me...

60
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:23,000
You and I are...

61
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,786
You know,
I don't know what were are.

62
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,320
We're kind of in no-man's-land.

63
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:29,257
Yeah, I mean-I mean, we've
hardly even known each other,

64
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:30,925
what, a few months.

65
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:37,682
You know,
it's really none of my business.

66
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:47,942
ALEX:
I'll be right out.

67
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:50,394
Yeah.

68
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:55,116
You know,
it's, uh, it's good you called.

69
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:57,034
There's, um, there's something

70
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,737
that I wanted to talk
to you about, too.

71
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,890
ALEX: I'll be all yours
if you just give me a sec.

72
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:15,052
Is this what
you wanted to show me?

73
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:22,477
No.

74
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:30,017
This is.

75
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,323
(frame clatters)

76
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:43,114
How am I supposed to compete
with six years?

77
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,566
Not to mention the fact
that they grew up together

78
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:50,121
and that she doesn't know all
the darker sides of him.

79
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:52,423
But, if I say, hey, pick me,

80
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,625
and ignore that
totally perfect, caring woman

81
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,460
that you planned on spending
your life with,

82
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,245
I am a total bitch.

83
00:03:58,247 --> 00:03:59,797
Aren't I?

84
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:02,600
Are you?

85
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,435
Don't "are you?" me.

86
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,103
It's bad enough
that I am being forced

87
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:07,972
to come here just to
get back to full duty.

88
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,690
I could do without
the self-reflective crap.

89
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,258
First of all, let me say

90
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,060
that I am impressed
by your willingness

91
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:14,261
to open up so quickly...

92
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,364
Yes, I know
the mandatory routine.

93
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,282
The sooner I spill my heart,

94
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:20,601
the faster I get out of here.

95
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,236
Second, what's mandatory,

96
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:23,754
is for us to discuss the trauma
that you went through

97
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:26,374
during the shooting,
not your boyfriend issues.

98
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:27,959
Oh.

99
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:30,077
Third, yes,
you would be.

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,913
And that's okay.

101
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:33,113
Sometimes in life
we need to be a bitch

102
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,900
in order to get
what we need.

103
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,335
And you're off to a good start.

104
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:39,086
Sorry.

105
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:43,090
I had enough therapy
to last a lifetime

106
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:44,308
when my mom was killed.

107
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,094
I know,
that is like throwing prime rib

108
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:48,763
at a Rottweiler.

109
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,898
Interesting choice of dog.
They're beautiful.

110
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,516
And dangerous.

111
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,803
No offense, Doctor...

112
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,822
Oh, David.

113
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,490
But I don't need a shrink

114
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,359
to figure out
what my problems are.

115
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:02,944
You mean running away from

116
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,986
tough emotions and throwing
yourself into your work?

117
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:07,748
I read your file.

118
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,334
I hope it was a good read.
Mm-hmm.

119
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:13,588
And from your file,
my conjecture is

120
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,155
you lean on
your crutches:

121
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:17,324
work, protecting people...

122
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,210
Yes, I took an oath.

123
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:20,928
To serve and protect.

124
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,130
But who are
you really protecting?

125
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,475
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

126
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,116
(keypad beeping)

127
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,835
(zipper closing)

128
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:11,145
Catherine?

129
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:13,931
Alex. Hey, hi.

130
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,716
What are you doing here?

131
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:17,101
I was just jumping
through hoops.

132
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,385
Had to get a final evaluation

133
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:20,021
before they return me
to full duty.

134
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,355
What are you doing?

135
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:22,990
I'm just heading home.
Running late.

136
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,358
For... the gym?

137
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,495
Oh, no,
it's, uh, change of clothes.

138
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,581
I live a very glamorous life.

139
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,166
(elevator bell dings)

140
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,584
Well, that's my ride.

141
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:34,585
See you.

142
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:37,171
Bye.

143
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:46,547
JT:
<i>Someone please explain to me</i>

144
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,967
how a guy who's unemployed,
never goes out,

145
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:52,353
and is officially dead,
gets not one,

146
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,639
but two smoking hot women
fighting for his attention.

147
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,092
No, JT, the whole point
of going over there

148
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,611
was to tell her
that I can't see her anymore.

149
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:02,697
Because...

150
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,948
because of Catherine.

151
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,733
Kind of, yeah.

152
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:08,769
I mean,
Catherine's life has

153
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:11,872
never been the same since
she found out about me.

154
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,124
And my secret.

155
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,875
Neither has yours.

156
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:20,631
You and Catherine, you risk
so much to keep me safe.

157
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,800
And you don't want Alex
to take the same risks.

158
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,135
No.

159
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:26,837
Okay, but what if
I don't tell her?

160
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,955
Vincent.

161
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,423
Look, I know what you're going
to say,

162
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,810
okay, but, JT,
to have someone look at you

163
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:35,730
and not feel like
you've got this big secret

164
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:37,214
that they have to protect,
you know.

165
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:39,016
Like Catherine does.

166
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:40,634
Yeah.

167
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:44,488
But, JT, I... I loved Alex.

168
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,242
You know, we spent our whole
childhoods planning everything,

169
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,494
and then... ah.

170
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:52,279
I don't know,
I guess I got afraid.

171
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,832
And you don't think
Catherine's just backing off

172
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,368
because she's trying
to do the right thing?

173
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:03,174
How did I end up
on Catherine's side of this?

174
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:04,425
My side of what?

175
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:07,378
All you, my friend.

176
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,801
(sighs)

177
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:16,720
What's this?

178
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:18,222
I don't know how
to tell you this,

179
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:20,474
but I ran into Alex
at the hospital.

180
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:23,027
She was putting a bunch of
boxes into her duffel bag,

181
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,231
and, it turns out that there
are a bunch of thefts

182
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,949
being reported at that ward.

183
00:08:28,951 --> 00:08:30,851
You've been spying on her?

184
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:35,022
I followed up
on something I saw.

185
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:36,490
Vincent,
she's stealing medicine

186
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,692
and supplies from the hospital.

187
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,377
You don't actually know that.

188
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,863
Okay.

189
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:46,167
You can believe me, or not,

190
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,702
but there is an open
narcotics investigation

191
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,370
into these thefts,

192
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:53,257
and someone else is going
to find out,

193
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,226
eventually.

194
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:59,713
Does she know?

195
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:03,767
I mean,
does she know how careful

196
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,320
she has to be with your secret?

197
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:07,938
No.

200
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:33,133
Ah, reading about skydiving
is surprisingly very boring.

201
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,969
Hope what you're doing
is a lot more interesting.

202
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,938
Oh, yeah,
I have sharpened every pencil

203
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,356
in the precinct.

204
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:40,607
Thank you.

205
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:43,060
So, how's the case going?

206
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,312
Mm, sorry, partner,
you're out on this one.

207
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:47,047
Okay, if you don't tell me
about this case,

208
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:49,049
I am going to make you get
mani-pedis with Heather.

209
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,088
Have you ever heard
of Noah Hawkes?

210
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,021
No.

211
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:55,855
He's one of Forbes'
wealthiest men under 35.

212
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,457
He went skydiving
with his wife.

213
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,543
Her chute didn't open,
neither did the backup.

214
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:00,860
EVAN:
That's because the parachute

215
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,862
was definitely tampered with.
Hey, Cat.

216
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:04,965
Hey. I didn't hear anything.

217
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,752
Based on the latent bacteria
on the rip cord,

218
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:12,089
it was cut 16 to 20 hours
before the jump.

219
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,225
All right, I'll look
into Noah Hawkes' alibi.

220
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:16,643
You may want to check
if he's left-handed.

221
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,095
From the angle of the cut,

222
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,730
I'm 99% sure
that the doer was a lefty.

223
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,548
But I did hear that.

224
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,817
That's my cue.

225
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,553
Okay, Tess,

226
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:28,321
you need to let me work
on this case,

227
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,690
or I am going
to get myself in trouble.

228
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,609
Sorry, Chandler,
Joe laid down the law.

229
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,578
You're to know nothing,
nada, zero.

230
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,530
Zip.

231
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:40,917
I'm mortified.

232
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,669
If I'd known it was
"towel-only" option...

233
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,070
Oh, God, oh, God.

234
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:47,958
It just... it started to feel
like old times

235
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,543
and I got carried away.

236
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:50,844
You know,
when that towel dropped,

237
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,679
I almost got carried away,
too, so...

238
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,418
Look, Alex,
I'm sorry...

239
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,537
No, I know.

240
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,472
This is all so strange.

241
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,141
I mean,

242
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:06,309
you knew me better than anyone.

243
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:09,196
Before or since.

244
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,482
I used to think I knew you
better than anyone.

245
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,751
You did know me.

246
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:18,155
But I am a completely
different person now.

247
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:20,524
Who isn't?

248
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:23,410
Vince, I admit,

249
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:27,614
with you back, it's
all so confusing.

250
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:30,283
I'm beginning to remember
my old self,

251
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,335
and I want that life

252
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:35,622
back so badly.

253
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:38,842
I guess the question is,
do you?

254
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:43,146
Want to go back in time
to the way we used to be?

255
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,447
Yeah,

256
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:46,316
yeah, I do.

257
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:48,185
But...

258
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,937
a lot has changed.

259
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:56,693
And I guess we both have
a few new secrets, yeah?

260
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,450
She saw me, didn't she?

261
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:05,819
(quiet laugh)

262
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:07,838
You could never lie
to me, Vince.

263
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,090
Your handler,

264
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,275
Catherine,

265
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:14,494
she caught me taking stuff
from the hospital.

266
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:17,264
I told her that you...

267
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,899
weren't into anything like that.

268
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,601
Actually I am.

269
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,186
Kind of.

270
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:26,839
You know how you said you
wanted your old life back?

271
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:30,877
Or parts of it anyway.

272
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,047
I have something to show you.

273
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:38,368
And no, it's not my linen
collection this time.

274
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,083
(bell jingles)

275
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,719
(distant siren wailing)

276
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,140
Hi.

277
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:02,342
Hello.

278
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,930
Okay, I never pegged you as
a drug lord, but this...

279
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,548
I have my doubts.

280
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,650
It'll all make sense
in a moment.

281
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,022
(coughing nearby)

282
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:21,194
What is this place?

283
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,913
Like a care unit?

284
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,331
It's for people
who can't pay

285
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,117
or can't get to
another facility.

286
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,336
There's still a lot of people
our there without jobs,

287
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:31,171
without any insurance.

288
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,123
They fall through the cracks.

289
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,543
Okay, Mrs. Voluska?

290
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:39,129
You can take a seat in there.
I'll be right with you.

291
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,215
Um, Nurse Alex?

292
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,467
Who's he?

293
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,269
Um, just a...

294
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,554
Just a friend.

295
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:49,973
Doctor.

296
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,957
TESS:
<i>Mr. Hawkes,</i>

297
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,476
did anyone besides
you and your wife

298
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:04,311
have access
to her parachute?

299
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:05,779
Am I being interrogated?

300
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:07,948
No, sir, I'm just trying
to assess the facts.

301
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,401
The facts are that Lisa
and I pack our own chutes.

302
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:14,287
And the morning of the jump,
nothing was out of place?

303
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:17,757
No one touches them but us.
I know this is

304
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,377
difficult, I only have
a few more questions to ask you.

305
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,345
You're with Noah Hawkes, right?

306
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:24,297
I bet you're a one sugar?
Black.

307
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:26,099
Ah.

308
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:27,901
I'm on the
Neanderthal diet.

309
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,436
What is the Neanderthal diet?

310
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:31,471
Nothing a caveman wouldn't eat.

311
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,356
I'm ready to kill somebody
for a carb.

312
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,475
(laughs)
Catherine Chandler.

313
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:37,760
Pam Davis,
CFO of Hawkes Worldwide.

314
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:40,697
Ah.

315
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:43,200
So how is Noah taking it?

316
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:45,952
He's a wreck.

317
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,787
Plus we're in the middle
of an IPO

318
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,408
and we spent the entire day
before Lisa's death,

319
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,709
uh, in marathon meetings.

320
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:55,045
Wow, sounds stressful.
Yeah.

321
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,581
Tears me up
to see Noah like this.

322
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,383
Did he have a happy marriage?

323
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,718
Storybook.

324
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,386
Outside of work,

325
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:05,222
they did everything together.

326
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,810
Lisa and I,

327
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:12,896
we loved living on the edge.

328
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:16,933
And we knew with that
risk comes a cost.

329
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:20,136
I just never dreamed the
price would be so high.

330
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:21,571
PAM:
<i>When somebody becomes</i>

331
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,773
that integral to your life

332
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:25,692
and suddenly they're gone,

333
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:28,194
it makes you wonder
who you are without them.

334
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:32,499
Yeah, I have some personal
experience in that department.

335
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,457
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah.

336
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,176
And if we need to talk
with you further?

337
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,378
I work the rest
of the afternoon,

338
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,797
then tonight there's
this event I have to be at.

339
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,683
That I obviously
don't want to be at.

340
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:50,850
But that you can't miss.

341
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,819
Exclusive billionaire boys' club

342
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,504
kind of deal at the Dylan Club.

343
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,973
You are more than welcome
to stop by if you need

344
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:58,725
to pull me aside
for a few minutes.

345
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:02,028
Call me whenever--
I'll track him down.

346
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:08,184
We should go to
the Dylan Club.

347
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:09,819
What, and party
with a suspect?

348
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:13,123
No, we'll go under the guise
of working on the case.

349
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,342
When in reality we're going...?

350
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,294
About the case.

351
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,995
And because you and I
are both attractive women

352
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:21,381
who shouldn't be wasting
our youth on available men.

353
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,249
So what, you want to get dressed
up, put on smoky eyes

354
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:24,668
and fall in love?

355
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,303
Is that it?
That's it exactly.

356
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:28,204
And, look, if we happen to
catch a break in the case,

357
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,639
it's two birds with one stone.

358
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,257
Preferably a diamond.

359
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,009
The big question is
what to wear.

360
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:38,148
(phone ringing)

361
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,716
JT:
Leave a message and if I don't

362
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:41,017
get back to you it's probably

363
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,219
because I don't really like you.

364
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,155
JT, it's Evan Marks.

365
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:48,158
I think I found another victim
of our cross-species animal.

366
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,076
I have clearance
to exhume the body

367
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:52,028
and in the spirit
of our partnership,

368
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,564
I thought you'd want to be there
to confirm if it's a match.

369
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,666
Call me. This could be big.

370
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:57,867
(phone beeps)

371
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:59,836
Wow.
Claire.

372
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,237
Someone sounds excited.

373
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,406
What are you doing here?

374
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:09,379
I know we were supposed

375
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:12,015
to meet at
the restaurant, but

376
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:14,584
I thought I'd surprise you.

377
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:20,190
It's a welcome surprise.

378
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:22,609
Mm.

379
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:35,104
A <i>very</i> welcome surprise.

380
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:40,994
I think restaurants
are overrated.

381
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:43,279
I find morgues
much more enticing.

382
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,882
As do I.

383
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,453
(laughing)

384
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,874
VINCENT:
<i>Okay, buddy,</i>

385
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,926
I'm not gonna lie
to you.

386
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,344
This is not gonna
feel good, okay,

387
00:17:58,346 --> 00:17:59,962
but it's gonna
be over quickly.

388
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,347
(exhales loudly)

389
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,816
Yeah, breathe.

390
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:04,684
And... one.

391
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:06,636
And two.
(grunts)

392
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:08,688
Ow!

393
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,156
(sighs)
Okay?

394
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:11,808
(panting)

395
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,810
You didn't count to three.

396
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,278
Yeah.

397
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,832
Well, waiting
for the pain is worse...

398
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:19,916
Worse than the real thing.

399
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,584
...thing.

400
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,289
You're glowing.

401
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,009
Uh, I'm a guy.
Guys don't glow.

402
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,828
Do they, Milo? Okay.

403
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,830
Hey, no more
board sliding, okay?

404
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,498
Okay.

405
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,183
All right, man. All right.
See you, Milo.

406
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:39,102
Thanks.

407
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,640
It felt good, didn't it?

408
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,174
Helping?

409
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,893
Uh, yeah, it did.

410
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:50,196
A little more
exciting than...?

411
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:51,781
I mean, wherever
it is you live,

412
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:54,367
I keep imagining
it's some dark corner

413
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:56,820
in a place that
everyone's forgotten.

414
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:58,371
Alex, it's fine, okay?

415
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:00,573
I've made peace with it.

416
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,908
But do you need to?

417
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,493
I mean, Vince,

418
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:05,462
look at what you just did.

419
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:07,997
You were amazing,

420
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,966
just like you
always were.

421
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:12,502
I guess it comes naturally.

422
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,587
Well, the doctor part, at least.

423
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:16,205
We need that.

424
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,091
We need <i>you.</i>

425
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:21,094
Nobody needs to know.

426
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,062
I mean, we're so
off the grid here,

427
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:25,648
it's not like anyone's
looking over our shoulder.

428
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,734
Don't you want that?

429
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:30,987
To be <i>that</i> Vincent again?

430
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:36,359
WOMAN: Miss Salter,
can you come in here, please?

431
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:40,530
(sighs)

432
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,834
(brakes squeak)

433
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,460
Welcome to Fright Night.

434
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,462
Should have packed
my wooden stakes.

435
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,796
Want me to plug you in
a night-light?

436
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,349
Let's just get this over with.

437
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,585
(wooden creaking)

438
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:09,020
Oh, yup.

439
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:10,805
That's a dead guy.

440
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:14,175
The whole opaque
skin tone thing.

441
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:16,261
Who was he?

442
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:18,196
Bike messenger that attacked
a colleague of mine

443
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,514
a few months ago.

444
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:21,950
I think the creature
intervened.

445
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:23,952
Sample from the wound

446
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,820
here should confirm it.

447
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:29,724
Or if there truly is a creature
roaming the city,

448
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:33,078
is it possible
that it could be cogent?

449
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,613
I mean,
wouldn't it have to have

450
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:37,215
feelings and emotions

451
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:39,234
and a sense of justice
and morality

452
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:40,752
to only be targeting criminals?

453
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:45,257
Then why do you want
to catch it so badly?

454
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:48,393
I don't.
I want to understand it.

455
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:52,514
You want to tag its ear and
follow its migration patterns?

456
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,465
More like question it.

457
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,101
If it had a choice,

458
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,436
would it retain
its evolved abilities, or

459
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:00,155
would it choose
to be cured?

460
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:02,908
Cured? Where did that come from?

461
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,292
From your research paper.

462
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:08,313
So if it did want to be cured,

463
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:10,815
would you help it?

464
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:14,652
I can't think of
a more extraordinary challenge.

465
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:19,257
Would you take this
for me, please?

466
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,270
(distant siren wailing)

467
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:33,638
(bell jingles, door closes)

468
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,174
Freeze, buster.

469
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,226
Am I supposed to put
my hands in the air?

470
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,946
You are not going home.

471
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,915
Well, as tempting

472
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,400
as the lukewarm beer
at O'Farrells is...

473
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:49,869
So forget O'Farrells.

474
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,203
We'll do something else.

475
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,905
Oh...
But we're celebrating.

476
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:55,457
And I won't take no
for an answer, Dr. Keller.

477
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:58,878
Wow, I never thought I'd hear
you call me that again.

478
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,179
It's what you are.

479
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,580
Come on.

480
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,254
(Alex giggling)

481
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,089
I can't believe they still
haven't fixed that door

482
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:12,775
after all these years.

483
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:15,227
Maybe we were the only ones
crazy enough to sneak in here.

484
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:25,070
We shouldn't
be here.

485
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:27,072
I'm sorry, but aren't
you the same guy

486
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:28,874
that once climbed
the Unisphere on a dare?

487
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:31,544
Yeah, well, maybe
I'm older and wiser.

488
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,162
Or maybe you've
just been hiding

489
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:35,464
the real Vincent Keller
for too long.

490
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:38,283
What if more has changed
than you realize?

491
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:41,587
It wouldn't matter.

492
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:45,391
When I thought
you were dead,

493
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:48,477
I used to fantasize
about leaving New York

494
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:51,129
and never coming back.

495
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,099
I read about this
mobile medical team

496
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:56,235
that works
in remote Nigeria.

497
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:58,470
They travel from
village to village,

498
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:01,941
helping whoever
needs medical care.

499
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:03,576
We could do it, Vince.

500
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:05,644
(sighs)
We could go together.

501
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:06,946
No.

502
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:08,747
Hey...

503
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,699
It doesn't have
to be a fantasy.

504
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,534
The sooner we get
out of here,

505
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,270
the sooner we
can start living.

506
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,826
(shrieks, laughs)

507
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:22,378
I wasn't ready.

508
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,629
Ready? Come on.
Oh...

509
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:25,330
Hold on.
Okay.

510
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,165
Slip on the ice.
Come on.

511
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:28,333
Hang on!

512
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:30,836
(laughs)

513
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:33,005
(Alex whoops)

514
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,941
Whoa.

515
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:37,977
(laughing):
Whee...

516
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:40,279
Ah! Oh!

517
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:42,948
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

518
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,818
Whoa... whoo.

519
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,869
Oh, my God.

520
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,520
I'm gonna fall.

521
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:51,857
Oh, my God.
(laughing)

522
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,443
(both laughing)

523
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,662
Thanks.

524
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:59,197
My pleasure.

525
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:04,202
MAN:
Don't move!

526
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,342
(indistinct radio transmission)

527
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:13,095
You're telling me
you don't have I.D.?

528
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:16,181
I just... need to
make a phone call.

529
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:19,818
Relax, man, I'm not taking
you two in for booking. Yet.

530
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,186
Just holding you.

531
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:23,989
But I need to be able
to identify you.

532
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:27,776
Come on, sir, please, just
don't-don't charge me, okay?

533
00:24:27,778 --> 00:24:29,061
ALEX: It was just a silly
little thing we did.

534
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,780
Not a felony.
Listen to your girlfriend.

535
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,782
This could be very easy--
you give me

536
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:36,568
your driver's license,
I call it in, we're done.

537
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,121
I just need my phone call.

538
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,739
And I need a name.

539
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,508
Seems we're
at a crossroads here,

540
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,343
and we're not going anywhere
till I know

541
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:46,512
who you are.

542
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:50,382
(indistinct chatter)

543
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:00,926
Look, I take back
every bad thing

544
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,260
I've ever said
about Heather.

545
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:04,096
These dresses she pulled
from work are sick.

546
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:07,533
Okay, so we talk to Pam
and then we go, right?

547
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:08,817
What's the rush?

548
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,536
Are my earrings
too slutty?

549
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:11,770
Too slutty for what?

550
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:13,238
(phone rings)
Good point.

551
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,540
Chandler.

552
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,775
VINCENT: Catherine.
Meet me at the bar.

553
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:18,160
Vincent?

554
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:19,778
Look, I need your help, okay?

555
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,548
I think I'm getting arrested.

556
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,116
Okay. Hold on.

557
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:26,451
Tess.

558
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:29,388
Oh, no.
You better not bail.

559
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,507
I'm not bailing.
Just a friend in need.

560
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:33,759
A guy friend?
Why do I even bother?

561
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:35,460
Get your ass
back here pronto.

562
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:37,596
Will do.

563
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:40,232
(indistinct radio chatter)
OFFICER: We've been over this.

564
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,518
You keep stalling me, you're
forcing me to take you in.

565
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,770
You don't understand.
Are you showing off for your girl?

566
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:46,972
Is that what this is?
No, I just...

567
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,991
It's simple.
I need a name.

568
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:51,276
Just tell him your name, Vince.
It'll be okay.

569
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:52,945
OFFICER: Vince. Okay, good.
That's a good start.

570
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,646
Vince what?
(low growl)

571
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:57,166
VINCENT:
I can't tell you.

572
00:25:58,752 --> 00:26:00,669
(growls)

573
00:26:00,671 --> 00:26:03,488
OFFICER: Okay, you know what, sir? I need
you to get inside the vehicle.

574
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,341
Watch your head.

575
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:09,178
Hey, what are you doing
with my C.I.?

576
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:11,997
Who are you?

577
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,298
Narcotics. From the 98th.

578
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,767
OFFICER: Little out of your district,
aren't you?

579
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:16,501
He was gathering information

580
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,270
for me on a case.
Are you all right?

581
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,555
Yeah, I could be better.

582
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:21,390
Why didn't you tell me
you were a C.I.?

583
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:22,775
Why would he tell you?

584
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:28,113
All right, give me your badge.
I'll run it through.

585
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,534
This look official
enough to you?

586
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:35,187
Now get on your walkie
and call off the 10-12.

587
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:37,206
I don't run it through...

588
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:39,458
you don't get your C.I.

589
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,077
Okay, if you screw up what
I have going on tonight,

590
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,163
I will bring a world
of hurt down on you.

591
00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:45,831
You'll be riding
your time until

592
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,633
retirement giving
parking tickets

593
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:50,052
to Eurotrash in SoHo.

594
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:56,875
Relax, sweetheart.
I'm just doing my job.

595
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:04,216
Just wait.

596
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,937
Okay, I am sorry
for putting you

597
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:10,656
in this position
and bringing you down here.

598
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:12,491
What the hell is
going on with you?

599
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:15,360
I had to lie to
a police officer.

600
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:16,862
If he had run my badge,
I would've been

601
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,113
kicked off the force.

602
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,616
And you were taped.
Every squad car

603
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,284
has a car-top camera on it.

604
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:24,203
Now I've got to
cover that up, too.

605
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:27,372
I know, okay? And I can
understand that you're upset.

606
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:28,624
I am beyond upset.

607
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,342
I-I am mystified.

608
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:33,011
Alex makes you do
reckless things

609
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:35,514
that the rest of us
have to protect you from.

610
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,599
It wasn't her fault, okay?
It was mine.

611
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:40,302
Well, then you know
that if that cop had booked you,

612
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,554
Muirfield would have been here
before the ink dried.

613
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,089
Don't you think I know that?

614
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,607
Okay, I nearly lost control

615
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,476
thinking about what would happen
if I was taken in.

616
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:49,862
It's not just you.

617
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:51,730
You put Alex at risk.

618
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:57,119
JT. You put <i>me</i> at risk, Vincent.

619
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:59,821
If you want to figure out if
you can get your old life back,

620
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:01,773
that's fine.

621
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:05,594
But it doesn't erase the life
that you have now.

622
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,663
You have to figure
out what you want.

623
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:10,615
Because...

624
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:14,086
if you're not gonna
protect yourself,

625
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:17,556
maybe it's time
that I rethink the risks

626
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:19,975
that I have taken
to protect you.

627
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,902
(sighs) Look, I'm sure this is
inappropriate for me to say,

628
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,555
but your boss is H-O-T.

629
00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:40,575
And as hot as he is,
is as kind and generous

630
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:42,777
as he is.

631
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,246
Sounds like someone
has a crush.

632
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,664
Not anymore.

633
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,199
He's so smooth.

634
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:50,251
Looks like he's wrapping up
a big deal.

635
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:53,571
Those suits he's talking
to are with the SEC.

636
00:28:53,573 --> 00:28:56,257
They're discussing
the initial public offering.

637
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:58,509
Shouldn't you be a part
of that conversation?

638
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,128
You're the chief
financial officer.

639
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,080
Noah likes to take
his high-level meetings alone.

640
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,799
The day
before Lisa Hawkes' death,

641
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:07,268
Noah was in an all-day meeting
with the SEC.

642
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,636
All day, all night.

643
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:10,254
Where were you?

644
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,256
I...

645
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:13,975
Back at the office.

646
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,726
Waiting for his instructions.

647
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:18,813
The dutiful work wife, right?

648
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:29,540
(gunshot)

649
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:39,801
(sighs)

650
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:46,090
(sighs)

651
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:49,260
You didn't show up for
your session this morning.

652
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,180
Only authorized personnel
are allowed on the firing range.

653
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:54,682
Well, since you're stretching
that guideline a bit,

654
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:56,300
why can't I?

655
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,020
I'm sorry about the other day.

656
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:01,322
I'm not usually so...

657
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:02,573
Do I get to run with that one?

658
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:05,443
(sighs)
I'm-I'm not easy.

659
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:09,831
You can ask...
any of my ex-boyfriends.

660
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:15,837
My chief, my partner,
my sister, my dad, my...

661
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,821
Oh, no, I'll let you
take that one. Your...?

662
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:22,677
Let's talk about why
you've been spotted

663
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,163
nosing around a case that you're
not approved to investigate.

664
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:29,433
Lot of eyes around
the precinct.

665
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:31,986
So, you take comfort
in your work.

666
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:33,337
You're good at it.

667
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,722
You have a strong purpose.

668
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:35,973
You're in control.

669
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:37,191
Yeah, you caught me.

670
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:39,510
Seriously,
wh-who doesn't do that?

671
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:41,345
What's so wrong
if I am committed

672
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:43,064
to a job that I care about?

673
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,515
Everything.

674
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,450
If you're doing it to escape

675
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:48,069
dealing with your true feelings.

676
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:52,189
The only thing I am trying
to escape right now is you.

677
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:53,541
Catherine, you're clearly

678
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:55,243
suffering from PTSD

679
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:57,328
from when Sabrina shot you
and you need to...

680
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,696
Post-traumatic stress?

681
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:01,465
You want to know
what PTSD is?

682
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:05,636
It's seeing my mom get gunned
down in front of my eyes.

683
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,674
Watching one of the few
people who really knew

684
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:13,043
and cared about me leave my life
for reasons I don't understand.

685
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,729
And it is happening again.

686
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:19,233
Yes. Yes, I have feelings
for the most complicated guy

687
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:23,020
on the planet, and-and he
doesn't appreciate the risks

688
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:26,557
that I take every
day to protect him.

689
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,660
He would rather be with someone

690
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:32,947
who doesn't even
know him anymore.

691
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,902
(rhythmic beeping)

692
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:44,091
It's him. It's our creature.

693
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:47,628
He killed the bike messenger.

694
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,430
Uh, for good reason.

695
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:51,265
The bike messenger
was a strangler.

696
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:52,717
Even so,
this is at least six cases

697
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,802
that the creature's
interfered with.

698
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:56,771
Not that I have proof
of all six, but...

699
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:58,889
I think this is
enough to go to Joe.

700
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:01,592
Joe? Who's Joe?
My boss.

701
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:03,260
Without the samples
that got stolen,

702
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:05,863
I needed a few new matches
before I could approach him

703
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:08,532
about forming a task force
to track down this thing.

704
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:11,035
But... I thought you didn't
want to catch it--

705
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:14,071
y-you wanted
to understand it, cure it.

706
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:16,073
I do. Once we've caught it.

707
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:17,325
JT, look around you.

708
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,961
I work in a
police station.

709
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:23,047
Good or bad,
this thing kills people.

710
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,199
It's my job
to help uphold the law.

711
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:28,002
Why do you look so worried?
Your boss.

712
00:32:28,004 --> 00:32:30,171
H-He'll interfere
with our research.

713
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:32,289
He'll bog us down
with red tape.

714
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:36,126
More like give us the manpower
that we need to find this thing.

715
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:45,686
(beeping)

716
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:47,471
EVAN:
What?

717
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:51,442
Corrupted? No!
No, you've got to be kidding me.

718
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:55,979
Maybe there was contamination
in the lab equipment.

719
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:58,032
That's impossible.
I sterilized everything.

720
00:32:58,034 --> 00:33:00,984
(groans) It's not like I can exhume
a buried man twice.

721
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,047
Pardon me, ma'am.

722
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:15,716
Oh, thank you.

723
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:21,806
Sorry I'm late.

724
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:24,191
I hear it's tough
to get a reservation here.

725
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,511
So...

726
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:29,780
how's it going?

727
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:31,682
With Evan?
Mm-hmm.

728
00:33:31,684 --> 00:33:33,284
Couldn't be better.

729
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:37,738
(sighs)

730
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,407
He was getting
a little close to Vincent

731
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,858
for my taste,

732
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,495
but I managed to disrupt
one of his studies.

733
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:47,298
I snuck into his lab
and I corrupted his samples.

734
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,500
And he doesn't know it was you?

735
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:51,969
I know how to keep
Evan preoccupied.

736
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,554
Ignorance is bliss, huh?

737
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,725
We'll get to Vincent
before the police.

738
00:33:57,727 --> 00:33:59,310
Then Muirfield will have

739
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:01,228
everything it needs
to move forward.

740
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:11,804
We need you to
sign that release

741
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,573
understanding your rights
in regards to questioning.

742
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,992
My heart goes out to you,
Pam.

743
00:34:15,994 --> 00:34:18,194
Being the other woman
can drive a woman crazy.

744
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:19,379
Don't I know it.

745
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:21,831
I'm not the other woman.

746
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:24,384
Uh, did you break up with him?

747
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:25,852
It was mutual.

748
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:28,254
See, now, that's not
my understanding.

749
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:30,156
I spoke to a Ben Williams
at the party.

750
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:32,175
Cute. Married.

751
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,326
Aren't they all.

752
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:34,660
He tells me
your relationship with Noah

753
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:36,463
abruptly ended
after Noah met Lisa.

754
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,065
Said it got a little tense
at the office.

755
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:50,109
So, you're left-handed.

756
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,896
Yes, I am.

757
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:54,514
Pam, we know the killer

758
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,800
had a left hand strong enough
to cut that rip cord.

759
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:59,035
We have CSU searching
for the knife you used

760
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:00,553
to cut the cord
on the parachute.

761
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:02,855
First, they're gonna
search your office,

762
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:04,874
then they're gonna
search your apartment.

763
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:06,626
And they're very
good, our CSU team.

764
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:08,361
They'll find it.

765
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:09,879
Now, if you help us out,

766
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:12,865
and you let us call off
the scavenger hunt,

767
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:16,069
we could put in a good word
with the D.A.

768
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:19,973
(sighs)

769
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:23,226
He told me he loved me.

770
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:26,179
That what we had

771
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:28,081
was special.

772
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:31,901
Oh... epic.

773
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:33,436
Oh...

774
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,989
that a love like ours

775
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:39,659
only came along
once in a lifetime.

776
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:44,897
I believed him.

777
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:48,418
Then he met Lisa.

778
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,204
And, uh, his head snapped

779
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:53,990
in her direction...

780
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:57,126
...and never snapped back.

781
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:00,597
And I should've

782
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,799
fought for him then.

783
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:08,254
But I was stunned.

784
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:11,107
By the time I composed myself,

785
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,560
they were married.

786
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:16,479
So you killed her?

787
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:24,487
Noah's... strong-headed.

788
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:26,739
(Pam sighs)

789
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:30,827
He was never gonna
change his mind.

790
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:33,196
I had ha take action.

791
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:39,202
She was never gonna know him
the way that I do.

792
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:47,644
(distant siren wailing)

793
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,314
(knocks)

794
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:53,516
Do I need armor this time?

795
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:54,684
(sighs)

796
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:56,519
Sorry, my last apology

797
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:57,970
didn't come out right.

798
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:02,442
You're not here
to apologize.

799
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:06,079
You feel what you feel.

800
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:10,650
Something tells me
that there's been a lot

801
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:12,985
that you have felt that

802
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,821
you needed to apologize for.

803
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:17,273
Your anger towards your mom,

804
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:19,158
your feelings for guys

805
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,826
who don't deserve
you, apparently.

806
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:22,495
And now you've

807
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:25,298
put your heart out there again
after you've kept it

808
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,935
locked up for so long,
and this lug nut

809
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:31,554
can't see how unique
your connection is

810
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:33,473
if he's tempted to fall
back into a relationship

811
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:34,958
that's safe and familiar,

812
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,477
but not really
what he needs, or...

813
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:39,362
not really what he wants.

814
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:40,480
Wow, that was...

815
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:41,648
that was oddly good.

816
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,848
Well,

817
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,233
you're not the only one

818
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:45,885
whose life isn't perfect.

819
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:48,421
Relationships are, um...

820
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:51,407
uh, they're a pain
in the ass.

821
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:53,076
Yeah, you can't make
someone love you.

822
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:54,661
But...

823
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:58,047
you can stop trying
to escape getting hurt

824
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:01,918
by throwing all of your energy
into protecting people.

825
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,720
Take a chance.

826
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:07,006
Have you told him

827
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,092
exactly how you feel?

828
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:11,260
Exactly what you want?

829
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:13,713
I don't know, I...

830
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:17,100
think it's pretty obvious.

831
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:19,318
You can't even say it to me.

832
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:32,465
I love him.

833
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:40,123
(door opens)

834
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:45,962
(door closes)

835
00:38:45,964 --> 00:38:47,430
Hey.

836
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:48,965
Hi.

837
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,767
I pulled some strings,

838
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,253
and I got the recording
from the police car.

839
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:55,888
Last time I cover for you.

840
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,257
Thank you.
Yeah.

841
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:02,862
Catherine, I am so...

842
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,897
No, you... you don't
have to say anything.

843
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:06,516
No. Please, let me.

844
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:12,221
You risked your job for me.

845
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:14,440
And Alex.

846
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:19,945
And even if I was
gonna be with her,

847
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:21,748
you were willing to protect me

848
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,466
unconditionally, and no one...

849
00:39:23,468 --> 00:39:24,667
Okay, I-I...

850
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:28,337
I wasn't honest with you.

851
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:30,373
When?

852
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:36,262
(laughs softly)

853
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:40,600
I can't compete with the life
you had with Alex.

854
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:43,302
But...

855
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:45,688
I don't want to
give up on us

856
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,907
before we've even begun.

857
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:55,531
I want to be with you, Vincent.

858
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:58,851
And I'm willing

859
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:00,986
to fight for you.

860
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,372
I...
I...

861
00:40:03,374 --> 00:40:05,758
I don't know
if my choice is...

862
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,543
so clear.

863
00:40:09,213 --> 00:40:13,166
I need to be honest
with you.

864
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:18,221
I really miss who I used to be.

865
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:20,439
You know, Vinnie Keller,
the doctor,

866
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:22,675
the normal guy.

867
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:25,928
And I think,
I really think,

868
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,214
I can be that person again.

869
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:32,685
And with me...

870
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:35,338
you'd always be, what?

871
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,441
Not normal?

872
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:42,261
Alex is willing
to give her life up

873
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:43,963
to go with me.

874
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:47,250
And not here, just...

875
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:49,919
away somewhere from

876
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,587
all of this so I can be free,

877
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:53,256
you know, from...

878
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,775
from Muirfield.

879
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:07,553
Would you?

880
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:12,608
Would she?

881
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,994
If she knew the truth?

882
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:26,255
Vincent, you haven't told her.

883
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:32,795
And until you do,
isn't all of this

884
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:36,265
just a fantasy?

885
