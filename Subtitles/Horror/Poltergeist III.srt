1
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,577
Morning. Morning.

2
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,332
<i>ELECТRONIC VOICE ON ТOY:</i>
<i>Can уou spell "Parakeet"?</i>

3
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,791
Parakeet.

4
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,919
B-I-R-D.

5
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,545
<i>B-I-R-D.</i>

6
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,797
<i>Wrong. Try again.</i> Wrong?

7
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,300
Wrong, Aunt Trish. Try again.

8
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,676
What's for breakfast?

9
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,303
My turn, huh? Mmm-hmm.

10
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,514
Darlin', Donna has locked
herself in our bathroom.

11
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,600
Would you get her the hell
out of there, please?

12
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,518
My favorite role,
the wicked stepmother.

13
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,978
Absolutely.

14
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,231
It's kind of chilly in
here this morning, huh?

15
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,733
Yeah. I’ll check it out.
You makin' breakfast?

16
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,944
Aunt Trish said it's my turn.

17
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,821
Shh with that
"Aunt Trish" stuff.

18
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,075
I have been begging you since you
got here not to call her that.

19
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,993
It's been a month already.

20
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,287
Bruce, old habits
die hard, you know.

21
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,331
Right, they do.

22
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,708
My mom always calls her Trish.

23
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,961
My grandma
always called her Trish.

24
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,507
But Aunt Pat hates it.
She thinks it's declasse.

25
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,841
<i>Declasse?</i>

26
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,262
Call her Pat, will you?

27
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,597
I’ll try. You wanna
help me make breakfast?

28
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,057
Yeah, I'd love to. Come on.

29
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,476
What does "declasse" mean?

30
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,438
Come on. I heard Mom and
Pop called last night.

31
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,604
CAROL ANNE: Yeah, they did.

32
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,525
PAT: Donna?

33
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,627
Donna? We're gonna be...
Just a second, Pat.

34
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,754
We're gonna be late again,

35
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,448
and you still have to use
my eyeliner, which I have.

36
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,579
Here. Thanks.

37
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,331
You look great.

38
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,582
Now remember, less is more.

39
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,549
Okay. We got eggs, sausage, bacon,
dill pickles. What’ll it be?

40
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,801
Toast'ems.

41
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,804
Oh, no! Not again.

42
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,931
I cook. You set the table.

43
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,225
Done.

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,601
A masterpiece.

45
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,811
A veritable Picasso.

46
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,731
No! He would have put
your nose over here.

47
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,191
Can I borrow this?

48
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,321
You look like an Eskimo.

49
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,031
Well, I'm a California person.

50
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,991
I'm not used to
wearing all this stuff.

51
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,410
Listen, surfer girl, the
week before you got here,

52
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,872
the temperature got above
zero for about six minutes.

53
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,248
If it's this cold inside,

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,917
you're gonna appreciate all those
things when you get outside.

55
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,920
Doesn't it ever
get warm in Chicago?

56
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,174
You are gonna regret that
remark come August, young lady.

57
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,260
August? I'm supposed
to go home before August.

58
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,348
If I had my way, I'd
keep you here forever.

59
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,478
Pat? What are you
gonna wear tonight?

60
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,562
Oh, I got...

61
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,855
Last year's salary.

62
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,774
It wasn't that expensive.

63
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,400
Ah! Oh, yeah?

64
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,991
And what are you
gonna wear, Dad?

65
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:02,893
My tux.

66
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,267
The one you wore
to your wedding?

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,641
Yeah, the one
I wore to my wedding.

68
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,991
You know, fashion's never
been your father's thing.

69
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,202
It's a year old, dear.

70
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,579
I think he looks handsome
in his wedding pictures.

71
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,122
There you are.
The voice of sanity.

72
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,207
I agree.

73
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,541
Handsome, but conservative.

74
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,584
I agree.

75
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,949
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you're on my side, remember?

76
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,381
A woman's entitled
to change her mind.

77
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,739
Uh, no, thanks.
We’ll take the next one.

78
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,642
Okay.

79
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,394
Who's driving me to work? Me.

80
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,603
Let's go.

81
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,492
AII aboard!

82
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,329
Thank you, my lady.

83
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,125
Vroom! Fasten your seat belts.

84
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,670
You better be careful, honey.

85
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,714
Remember what happened
to Narcissus.

86
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,174
Nar who?

87
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
Greek mythology.

88
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,984
He was a guy who loved looking at
his reflection so much in a pond,

89
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,596
he fell in and drowned.

90
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,181
Only a boy could be that clumsy.

91
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,684
You got that right. BRUCE: Hey!

92
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,235
What's wrong?

93
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,282
Well, every new building
has its problems.

94
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,412
But we’ll get those problems
before they get us, right? Huh?

95
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,874
Right?

96
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,500
Right.

97
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,013
Hold it, please!

98
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,664
Bye, honey.

99
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,249
Have a good day.

100
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,918
Thanks for the lift.

101
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,836
Bye, Dad.

102
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,422
Morning, there, Gene.
How you doing?

103
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,594
Morning, Bruce. Mornin'.

104
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,833
Morning, Mr. Gardner.
Morning, Bill.

105
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,060
What's with the heat, anyway?

106
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,465
I don't know.
I'm checkin' it now.

107
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,188
Probably got a thermo
on the fritz.

108
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,233
Well, get it fixed and have somebody
check out freight elevator 15.

109
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,438
Got a bit of a stutter in it.

110
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,693
15? Sure.

111
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,278

Great! I don't have to go
to that creepy school today.

118
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,094
Oh, no.

00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,600
No problem here.

181
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,310
Okay, whoo!

182
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,813
Nothing's gonna go wrong, huh?

183
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>KANE: Patricia.</i>

184
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,986
<i>Оh, Тrish.</i>

185
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,742
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

186
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,330
So, are you coming
to my party tonight?

187
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,415
I don't think so.

188
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,458
How come?

189
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,942
She can't come
to our party tonight.

190
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,795
She has to stay upstairs
and take care of Carol Anne.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,173
'Cause her mother's having
her own party tonight.

192
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,049
I heard her mother tell Mom.

193
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,260
It's my party, not ours.

194
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,304
Listen, mouth,
Pat's not my mother.

195
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,723
And if I wanted to come to
your brother's party, I could.

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,950
Hey, Bruce. You got a second?

197
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,035
Yeah, what's up, Nate?

198
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,268
Come here, let me
show you somethin'.

199
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,080
Okay.

200
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,460
AII right. Where we goin'?

201
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,806
What? Somebody broke
the mirror. Replace it.

202
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,474
Oh, not just this panel.

203
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,186
Every panel from the concourse
all the way up to the top.

204
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,813
Hey, Nathan.

205
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,523
Bill. Mr. Gardner.

206
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,608
You guys have to see this.

207
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,921
BRUCE: Ice.

208
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,216
Now, how the hell
could that happen?

209
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,553
Kind of hoped you'd
tell us, Mr. Gardner.

210
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,478
Sally, call the heating and
air conditioning contractor,

211
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,188
and tell Stan to
get down to my office

212
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,525
with a schematic for the
ventilation system. Pronto.

213
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,778
<i>SALLY ON WALKY-TALKY:</i>
<i>Yеs, sir, Mr. Gardnеr.</i>

214
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,216
How come you go to the
Seaton school for weirdos?

215
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,177
It's for smart kids,
not weirdos.

216
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,942
Yeah, that's why you
don't go there, mouth!

217
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,139
Martin!

218
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,350
There she is.

219
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,894
Yeah, okay.

220
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,737
Thank you, Mrs. Moyer.

221
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,406
Boo! Seen any ghosts lately?

222
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,866
Leave her alone.

223
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,075
You a cop or somethin'?

224
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,744
Hey, watch it,
you little asshole!

225
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,662
Scott! Shut the door!

226
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,839
You're so declasse.

227
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,935
Damn.

228
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,021
Carol Anne.

229
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,940
Yeah, I know.

230
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,192
The kids have
started teasing her.

231
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,403
I was hoping we could keep
her ghosts in my closet.

232
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,864
This doesn't make
my job any easier.

233
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,784
That's why you get
the big bucks, Doc.

234
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,910
Funny, Deborah.

235
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,620
You could call in an exorcist.

236
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,955
Funnier.

237
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,561
Donna! I'm really sorry you're
not comin' to the party.

238
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,522
I kind of hoped you...

239
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,482
You were.

240
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,069
Oh, Scott!
My knight in shining acne.

241
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,613
HELEN: Marcie, shut up
and leave them alone.

242
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,908
Maybe we could catch
a movie tomorrow night.

243
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,910
Maybe. Call me.

244
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,583
Excuse me. Thanks.

245
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,751
He's still panting.

246
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,255
You know, I wish Dusty would,
like, pant that for me, you know.

247
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,756
Jeff's constantly in heat.

248
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,842
I practically have to
muzzle him every night.

249
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,010
It's a real drag.

250
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,429
Maybe he could,
like, give Dusty ideas?

251
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,472
I don't know
if you could handle it.

252
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,391
Well, it'd be totally
radical to try.

253
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,518
Get a grip, girls.

254
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:15,408
This is <i>the Second Piano
</i> Concerto by Chopin.

255
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,622
I’ll bet all of
you probably think

256
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,002
this was written by some old geezer
who looked like Dr. Seaton, hmm?

257
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,381
<i>Well, it wasn't.</i>

258
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,551
In fact, Freddy
Chopin composed this

259
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,345
when he was only 19 years old.

260
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,515
And he'd already written a lot.

261
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,811
He'd been playing by ear and
making up tunes since he was six.

262
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,110
At eight, he had written his
first of several polonaises.

263
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,073
And at the ripe old age of 12,

264
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,034
he was asked to play
for the Czar of Russia.

265
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,121
Pretty scary, huh?

266
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,040
Even for an old-timer of 12.

267
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,932
But in a school like this,
where we're dealing

268
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,092
with gifted children
with emotional problems,

269
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,927
what we have to
do is open them up.

270
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,804
So, we try to make
them aware of the fact

271
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,265
that other famous child prodigies
shared similar problems.

272
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,393
It makes them comfortable to
know they're not that different.

273
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,814
These kids are about to find out that
Chopin was almost crippled by shyness

274
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,440
and used his music
to overcome it.

275
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,693
Excuse me, Dr. Seaton.
That little blonde girl

276
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,071
keeps staring at the
mirror as if she sees us.

277
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,408
Do you think she can?

278
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,535
MAN: No.

279
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,703
But you think she's
staring straight at you?

280
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,957
Yeah.

281
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,251
That seems to be one
of her dubious talents,

282
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,961
making people believe things.

283
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,087
Has she ever...

284
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,047
Let's talk in the hall.

285
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,569
SEATON: She's a very interesting
case, our Carol Anne.

286
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,530
Reasonably well-balanced,
extremely intelligent,

287
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,532
IQ well into the 150s,

288
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,576
and one hell of an imagination.

289
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,743
MAN: Most bright kids do.

290
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,620
True, but even
the brightest ones

291
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,707
allow adults to intimidate
them back to reality.

292
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,668
"Hey, Dad, there's a
purple cow in our yard."

293
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,254
"What, are you nuts?
Get out of here."

294
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,465
But Carol Anne's different than
most of our other little geniuses.

295
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,385
She seems to be able to
project her imagination,

296
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,680
convince others that the purple
cow in the yard is real.

297
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,058
Apparently, she actually
convinced an entire neighborhood

298
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,935
that it was haunted.

299
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,353
Yep, there's a talent.

300
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,856
You think she's able to create
some sort of mass hysteria?

301
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,235
No, not really. It's
more like mass hypnosis.

302
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,865
As I work with her... Try to work
with her, the child's impossible.

303
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,286
The more I'm convinced she actually might
be capable of inducing mass hypnosis.

304
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,996
Have you put her under?

305
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,373
Only once. It was terrifying.

306
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,209
MAN: For her? For both of us.

307
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,878
I started to experience
what she was seeing.

308
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,946
Tangina.

309
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,158
My God.

310
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,161
He found her.

311
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,330
Oh!

312
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,915
He found her.

313
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,753
I'm sorry.
Stay, finish your tea.

314
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,713
I've got to go.

315
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,889
Mommy, where are you? I can't see you!
Where are you?

316
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,476
He's after me, Mommy!
He's after me! I'm scared!

317
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,603
Yes, I am running!
I'm running, Mommy!

318
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,189
I can't find you!
He's getting closer!

319
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,440
Who?

320
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,943
The man! The ugly man!

321
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:23,239
Shh, I've got you, Carol Anne.
You're safe. Shh.

322
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,410
You're in your room in Cuesta Verde.
You're safe.

323
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,161
Everything's calm.

324
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,884
Carol Anne,

325
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,387
tell me about
what's just happened.

326
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,390
The man wanted me to
lead him into the light.

327
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,312
It's so cold there.
I heard them talking.

328
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,064
He said it was my daddy's
fault 'cause of the houses,

329
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,900
the houses my daddy
built on their graves.

330
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,111
He said I had to lead
'em into the light.

331
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,988
Into the light!

332
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,906
Why do you have to
lead them, Carol Anne?

333
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,992
I was born in that house.

334
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,246
Robbie! Robbie!
The tree's eating Robbie!

335
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,497
Sleep.

336
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,009
I'm going to count
to three, Carol Anne.

337
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,179
And when I snap my
fingers, you will awaken.

338
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,598
You will not remember
any of this.

339
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,727
One, two, three...

340
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,358
How do you feel?

341
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,984
Okay.

342
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,612
Carol Anne, one word.

343
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,740
How do you feel
deep down inside?

344
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,742
One word.

345
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,453
I don't know.

346
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,790
Well, lonely, maybe.

347
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,839
Lonely, huh?

348
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,388
Sure, why not?

349
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,473
It gets lonely being away
from home, doesn't it?

350
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,851
Yeah. Aunt Tri... Pat.

351
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,812
Pat and Bruce and
Donna are real nice,

352
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,980
but I miss my mom and dad.

353
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,315
And even my brother.

354
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,121
That's very good.

355
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,414
What?

356
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,059
They way you made
me look in the mirror.

357
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,418
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>make you look at anything.</i>

358
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,129
That's what he meant.
Manipulation.

359
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,172
What were you looking
at that made me turn?

360
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,091
Nothing.

361
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,510
Carol Anne, you were
looking at something.

362
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,513
I don't wanna talk about it.

363
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,475
When you talk about things
that bother you, they go away.

364
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,769
No, if you talk about
things, they happen.

365
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,312
Who told you that?

366
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,606
Go away!

367
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,204
Are you all right?

368
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,373
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,339
WOMAN: What happened?
What broke the mirror?

370
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,180
A little demonstration
in mass hypnosis.

371
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:39,602
She made me believe I saw a coffee
mug fly off my desk into the mirror,

372
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,521
while giving you a
suggestion to smash it.

373
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,721
Beautiful sight, isn't it?

374
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,805
Mmm-hmm.

375
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,685
Did I ever tell you how to
make a little girl laugh?

376
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,896
I never did, huh?

377
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,565
Well, it takes
a lot of practice.

378
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,609
First thing you got to do

379
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,238
is tickle right
here under the ribs.

380
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:39,662
Hey, don't worry about that seven years'
bad luck stuff. That's old wives' tales.

381
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,871
I didn't break it.

382
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,458
Hey, I believe you. But
I’ll tell you a secret.

383
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,586
If that old nerd were my
doctor, I would have done it.

384
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,338
I didn't. He did.

385
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,215
Dr. Seaton?

386
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,341
No.

387
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,595
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

388
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,391
Okay.

389
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,019
See you, slugger.

390
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,796
How's Carol Anne?

391
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,299
I don't know.

392
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,264
How would you feel if some quack told
you you had supernatural powers?

393
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,601
Do you remember that guy that
was on all the talk shows?

394
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,895
What was his name? He was
from Israel or someplace.

395
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,773
He used to bend keys,
fix watches,

396
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,235
took Polaroids of himself in the dark.
Maybe Carol Anne...

397
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,696
Pat, please. Not you, too.

398
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,968
Give the kid a break,
will you, please?

399
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,826
First your crazy brother-in-law
uses her as a scapegoat

400
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,287
for those $250,000 collapsible
homes he built...

401
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,371
Oh, Steven didn't...

402
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,125
Steven and your sister have put
that poor thing through hell

403
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,586
with those weirdo psychics
and witch doctors.

404
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,756
"Weirdo psychics
and witch doctors?"

405
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,798
Come on!

406
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,634
Pat, darling,

407
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,387
you are the only sane person
in your family. Please.

408
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,017
Don't let that pompous-ass
shrink tell you

409
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,436
she's Carrie or Houdini

410
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,688
or some damn thing like that.

411
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,190
Look, Bruce,
nobody really knows

412
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,734
what happened there
this afternoon.

413
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,488
Maybe we shouldn't leave
the girls here alone tonight.

414
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,908
Yeah, well, maybe we should just
forget the opening altogether, huh?

415
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,576
Don't be stupid.

416
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,746
AII right, all right.
We're both bein' stupid.

417
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,511
You've got opening night jitters and
I got a building falling apart.

418
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,085
Exactly, and we really
needed my sister

419
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,753
pressuring us
into taking her kid

420
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,171
like we needed
a hole in the head.

421
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,549
I really don't mind a house
full of beautiful women.

422
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,177
The more the merrier.

423
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,304
Yeah, then hire us a maid.

424
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,848
Swedish? About 24?

425
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,851
Five feet two?
Talk about pressure.

426
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,561
Will you go get dressed?

427
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,897
What did I say? What did I say?

428
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,666
Hi, sweetie. Can I have
a good night kiss?

429
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,793
Ah.

430
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,670
Mmm.

431
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,130
AII set.

432
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,671
Have a good night's sleep.

433
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,299
Good night. Night.

434
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,301
Be right with you.

435
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,348
She's got the hots
for him. I'm serious.

436
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,308
No, I see her every single day.

437
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,894
Look for her at the beginning of the day.
I'm dead serious.

438
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,979
She follows him all the time.

439
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,063
Will you...

440
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,189
Yeah, well...

441
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,524
Will you do me a favor?

442
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,608
Hmm?

443
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,735
No ghost stories
tonight, all right?

444
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,986
Gotcha.

445
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,238
Yeah? Yeah.

446
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,906
Okay. Good night.

447
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,991
Bye.

448
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,368
My dad. I don't know
what he's talking about.

449
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,752
Not bad at all.

450
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,212
Forget it.

451
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,965
However, after the opening...

452
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,112
Sandy, I know it's gonna be a
great party, but I can't come.

453
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,699
No, I'm brat-sitting.
She's not even a relative.

454
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,869
Well, she's sort of a
relative, but not really.

455
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,831
Yeah, well, if Scott wants
to call me from the party,

456
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,708
I might talk to him.

457
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,338
Okay.

458
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,964
Bye.

459
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,051
What you doin'?

460
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,345
Eavesdroppin'.

461
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,305
Why don't you go
to Martin's party?

462
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,640
You know I can't.

463
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,309
I’ll cover for you.
They’ll never know.

464
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,646
If I get caught, we’ll
both get in trouble.

465
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,481
I can take the heat.

466
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,528
Listen, Carol Anne, I didn't mean
what I said to Sandy on the phone.

467
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,822
Oh, I don't mind being
"sort of a relative,"

468
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,949
as long as we're friends.

469
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,492
Good.

470
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,530
Takamitsu, there are some people
over here I'd like you to meet.

471
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,550
Hey, looks like the show
is a success, darling.

472
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,387
Pat, Bruce! Like the art.
Love the sushi.

473
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,471
It's nice to see you.

474
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,807
Excuse me. Pat, come here,
I gotta talk to you.

475
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,893
Hello, Mary.

476
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,145
Uh, Bruce, you tryin' to
save money on the heat here?

477
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,564
Oh, I wish that were the case.
You know, new equipment.

478
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,274
Tryin' to work out
the bugs and all that.

479
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,525
Good to see you.

480
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,580
Hey, you look great.

481
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,789
Anne Klein II.

482
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,957
Remember, less is more.

483
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,546
Hey, you look great.

484
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,599
Look, maybe I ought to
stay home with you tonight.

485
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,851
Just go already. I’ll be fine.

486
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,616
How come you're taking
your dad's passkey?

487
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,910
I'm gonna use the
emergency stairs

488
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,329
so nobody sees
me in the elevator.

489
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,872
You got Martin's number, right?

490
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,791
Yes. I won't stay long.

491
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,875
Have fun.

492
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,335
Okay.

493
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,836
Bye. Be good.

494
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,921
I will.

495
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,246
Hi. Hi.

496
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,018
What's the matter?
Is the stereo broken?

497
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,168
No, it's my parents.

498
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,920
I thought they weren't
going to be home.

499
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,506
Tell me about it. My
father's not feeling well,

500
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,758
and my mom says if she
can hear the party,

501
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,343
the party's over.

502
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,761
I thought you couldn't come.

503
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,264
Couldn't stay away
from hot Scott, huh?

504
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,434
Marcie, back to your cage.
It's feeding time.

505
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,643
Psst.

506
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,812
50 bucks, and she's history.

507
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,313
You're on.

508
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:46,732
Hi, Donna.

509
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,816
Scott.

510
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,241
DONNA: Hey, there,
hi, there, ho, there.

511
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,369
I can't believe I risked
getting into trouble for this.

512
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,955
I bet we could
find some trouble.

513
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,165
Your parents aren't home.

514
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,667
Yeah, sounds great. How
many bedrooms you got?

515
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,461
Shut up, Jeff.

516
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,545
Carol Anne's up there.

517
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,389
Is there something open
down in the galleria?

518
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,883
Uh, forget it.
Didn't bring my fake ID.

519
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,343
What?

520
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,137
That's where my stepmother's having a party.
I can't go down there.

521
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,097
You're a real killjoy
tonight, aren't you?

522
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,224
Hey, isn't there a pool
somewhere in this building?

523
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,101
It's locked at night.

524
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,352
But...

525
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,072
<i>ELECTRONIC VOICE ON TOY:</i>
<i>G-O-R-I-L-L-A.</i>

526
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,491
<i>That is correct.</i>

527
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,535
<i>Can you spell "Pheasant"?</i>

528
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,829

To that art gallery opening

577
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,653
Put dinner on a low flame.

578
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,406

Okay, guys, there's
a camera in the hallway.

We’ll go in twos.
I’ll tell you when to go.

Watch the camera.

00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,214
When the red light goes off,
then go into the locker rooms.

598

There's always suits
on the clothes lines.

713
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,005
There's a bunch of kids
partying up in the pool

714
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,883
who claim they're guests
of your daughter.

715
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,301
Excuse me.

716
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,104
BRUCE: Okay,

717
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,148
so you all left the party together
and they let you in here,

718
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,402
went to the security room
to turn off the camera,

719
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,654
and then where did they go?

720
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,716
I don't know where
Scott and Donna went.

721
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,534
We didn't hurt anything. AII
we were doing was swimmin'.

722
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,098
Where was Carol Anne
through all this?

723
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,829
Not with us.

724
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,253
Okay. Thanks, guys. Take
the kids back to 56E.

725
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,898
I’ll have a talk with
the parents later.

726
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,007
Right, Mr. Gardner. Come on!

727
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,176
Great. My parents are going
to ground me till I'm 40.

728
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,970
Hey, it’ll give
you time to study.

729
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,514
You might pass something
besides Auto Shop this year.

730
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,656
Donna.

731
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,741
Scott?

732
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,992
Donna.

733
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,620
They... Scott!

734
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,997
They... They got Donna.

735
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,332
Who? Who's got Donna?

736
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,458
They got Donna and...

737
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,959
What're you saying?
And they got Carol Anne.

738
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,669
Who's got Carol Anne?
They got 'em.

739
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,421
Who, damn it, who?

740
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,179
What happened?

741
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,972
He just came up
through the ice.

742
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,725
What ice?

743
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,018
The ice in the...

744
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,979
Pool.

745
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:57,029
She's gotten to you, too. It's
a suggestion, Mr. Gardner.

746
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,406
A posthypnotic suggestion.

747
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,244
They got 'em. They got Donna
and they got Carol Anne.

748
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,121
They got them both.

749
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,789
They've got 'em.

750
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,708
They got 'em.

751
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,645
CAROL ANNE: Aunt Trish,
help me!

752
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,855
Help!

753
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,233
Aunt Trish, help me, please!

754
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,027
Help me!

755
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,320
Carol Anne? Carol Anne!

756
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,115
CAROL ANNE: Aunt Trish, please!
Help me!

757
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,783
<i>KANE: She's mine!</i>

758
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,201
Bruce!

759
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,328
CAROL ANNE: Aunt Trish!

760
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,205
Please help me!

761
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,957
Help me!

762
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,335
Bruce! CAROL ANNE: Help me!

763
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,337
Hang on, I'm pullin'.

764
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,590
Hang on. I'm pullin'.

765
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,554
CAROL ANNE: Help me!

766
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,264
Aunt Trish, help!

767
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,849
PAT: Carol Anne, hold on!

768
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,350
I've got you.

769
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,853
I've got you, Carol Anne.
Hold on!

770
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,897
CAROL ANNE: Help!

771
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,861
CAROL ANNE: Help me!

772
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,863
PAT: Hold on, Carol Anne!
We've got you!

773
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,187
CAROL ANNE: Get me out of here!

774
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,407
Pull!

775
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,576
Pull!

776
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,954
Grab hold of her! Grab hold of her!
I've got her.

777
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,789
I've got both of you! Pull!

778
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,250
Don't let go! Pull!
PAT: Hold on.

779
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,173
TANGINA: Get away!

780
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,886
That's not Carol Anne!

781
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,388
<i>KANE: Damn you!</i>

782
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,731
TANGINA: Stay back.

783
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,984
Stay back. He's got the
girls and now he wants you.

784
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,570
What are you talking about?

785
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,322
The preacher Kane.

786
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,574
He knows that as long
as there's someone

787
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,953
on this side that loves them,
you can get them back.

788
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,997
How did you know
that wasn't Carol Anne?

789
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,000
What surprised me, dear,

790
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,461
is that you didn't.

791
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,757
Who the hell are you?

792
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,303
I'm one of your
brother-in-law's

793
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,639
weirdo psychics.

794
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,557
Shh.

795
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,645
Carol Anne and Donna
are not in that room.

796
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,858
Well, some goddamn thing is.

797
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,193
Oh, yes.

798
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,196
Anger, rage,

799
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,200
evil, they are in that room.

800
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,078
Can you feel the cold?

801
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,122
He's devouring the heat,

802
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,040
the energy.

803
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,960
He's gathering his strength.

804
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,714
We must find the girls before
he becomes too strong.

805
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,216
If Donna and Carol Anne
aren't in that room,

806
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,342
then where are they?

807
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,720
The other side.

808
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,306
Before we can find the girls,

809
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,058
we must find out
where they entered.

810
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,563
Where did Dr. Rasputin

811
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,398
take Scott?

812
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:24,069
WOMAN: Excuse me, Dr. Seaton?

813
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,281
Excuse us.

814
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,749
Do your stuff.

815
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,175
Okay, Scott,

816
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,178
I want you to
look at the light.

817
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,556
Look at the light.

818
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,434
Look at the light.

819
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,696
Security.

820
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,448
Burt, this is Gardner.

821
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,783
Could you get your
guys together, please?

822
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,108
My daughter and niece are
roaming the building somewhere,

823
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,330
and I'd like them found
as soon as possible, okay?

824
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,583
What?

825
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,169
Oh, damn it.

826
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,880
Yeah, okay.

827
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,217
Terrific.

828
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,805
First, the heating,
then the electrical problems.

829
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,933
Now the security monitors.

830
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,978
Oh, Bruce, this is really
happening, isn't it?

831
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,981
Depends on who
you want to believe.

832
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,153
Tweedledum or tweedle-dumber.

833
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,994
Scott,

834
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,164
you and Donna are
at the swimming pool.

835
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,959
SEATON: You're leaving.

836
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,002
Where are you going?

837
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,673
The security room.

838
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,342
We saw Carol Anne
on the monitor.

839
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,387
Which monitor?

840
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,848
She was in the garage.

841
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,685
The puddle.

842
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,354
Hands came out of the puddle!

843
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,607
They grabbed us, the hands!

844
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,068
Keep her away from me!

845
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,071
Keep her away from me!

846
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,739
Shh.

847
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,536
What puddle?

848
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,289
What puddle, Scott?

849
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,541
What puddle?

850
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,170
The... In the garage.

851
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,547
In the garage.

852
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,215
In the garage!

853
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,742
They're between dimensions,

854
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,827
behind reflections,

855
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,414
behind mirrors,
stealing images.

856
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,626
Carol Anne.

857
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,921
Carol Anne.

858
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,173
Carol Anne!

859
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,677
<i>CAROL ANNE: The light!</i>
<i>Тhe light!</i>

860
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,807
<i>It's so cold.</i>
<i>Тhe light, it's so cold!</i>

861
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,976
Carol Anne,

862
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,187
listen to me.

863
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,773
Find your way
back to your room.

864
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,067
You must go back to your room.

865
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,986
<i>He won't let me.</i>

866
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,821
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

867
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,782
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

868
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,285
Find Donna and go back to your room.
Run, Carol Anne, run!

869
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,372
Enough. Stop this
stupid sideshow.

870
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,707
Oh, it's a great act.

871
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,710
Carol Anne creates the
fire and you feed it.

872
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,712
You made this happen.

873
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,341
You made her talk about him,
you made her remember him.

874
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:17,803
He was lost.
You brought him here.

875
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,012
Ludicrous.

876
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,182
It's your choice.

877
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,977
Tweedledum

878
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,980
or tweedle-dumber.

879
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,195
Tell us what to do.

880
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,492
Pray that Carol Anne
heard me and listens.

881
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,037
We must get up there
as fast as we can.

882
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,459
SEATON: This is
stupid, idiotic!

883
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,169
What's the matter
with you people?

884
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,422
Can't you see that
Carol Anne's behind this?

885
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,340
She's making us believe
this is happening.

886
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,758
It's... It's all a hypnotic...

887
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,260
It's about as stupid
and idiotic

888
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:01,722
as you hypnotizing that coffee
cup through the mirror.

889
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,696
That's good.

890
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:23,535
He’ll try to trick you.
He’ll try to separate you.

891
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,037
Don't let him.

892
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,581
Your love, your bond,

893
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:33,045
your caring for these two children,
is our most valuable weapon.

894
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,930
Let me take the chances.

895
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,850
What's that?

896
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,894
Some sort of mystical amulet?

897
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,021
A tool of your trade?

898
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,606
It was a gift.

899
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,608
From a good friend.

900
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:59,154
A powerful medicine man who
walked among the spirits

901
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,448
and returned.

902
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,202
There's power here.

903
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,247
I only pray it is enough.

904
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,841
Because Kane still
thinks he needs her.

905
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,761
He was insane when he lived,

906
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,180
and now, in death,

907
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,932
that insanity

908
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,434
has become the beast.

909
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,145
He wants Carol Anne now,

910
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,773
before she grows up.

911
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,943
Youth is a strong life force.

912
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,780
Innocence is pure life force.

913
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,992
We lose strength as we
lose our innocence.

914
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:50,455
You see, innocence is the only
gift we're given in life.

915
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,917
AII else must be fought for.

916
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,463
In that gift is purity.

917
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,633
In that purity

918
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,052
lies strength.

919
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,888
That's a lot of crap
that doesn't mean anything.

920
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,557
Shut up, Seaton.

921
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,362
Unlock it.

922
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,790

Come through the mirror.

We want you to come join us.

01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,549
We miss you.

941
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:28,094
You can come back through
the mirror, Carol Anne.

942
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,851
Please, Carol Anne, come
back through the mirror.

943
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,395
Come back to this side,
sweetie.

Carol Anne?

946
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,906
Come to me, Carol Anne.
Don't be frightened.

947
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,827
Don't be afraid, sweetie.
Come to us.

01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,288
Won't you join us, Carol Anne?

Get over here,
for Christ's sake!

957
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,255
I got you, baby.
It's okay, it's okay.

958
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,549
There you go.

01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,013
Carol Anne! I got you.
You're all right.

01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,431
Carol Anne! Where is she?

961
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,767
Carol Anne's drowning!
She's drowning!

962
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:39,851
Where? Where?

She's drowning!

What does it matter anymore?

971
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,114
Who the hell goddamn cares?

972
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,116
Baby...

973
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,121
Carol Anne! Take care of
her for a minute, please.

Shh. It's okay.

DONNA: Carol Anne's
drowning! She's drowning.

978
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,879
Baby, you've got to get
a hold of yourself.

979
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,215
I can't deal with this anymore.

980
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:13,677
Bruce, I love you and Donna.
That's our family.

981
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,720
Let's get out of here.

982
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,205
Let Dr. Seaton
deal with Carol Anne.

983
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,640
Baby, she's your niece.

984
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,891
I don't care.

985
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,894
I can't take these sick
little games anymore.

986
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,898
I never should have let Steven
and Diane send her to us.

987
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,733
Carol Anne! Bruce!

988
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,151
Bruce, please!

989
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,618
Carol Anne!

990
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,249
Bruce!

991
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,926
Dad! Dad!

992
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,554
Relax, Donna. Relax.

993
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,681
You're safe.

994
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,267
You're just having a bad dream.

995
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,270
We're all having a bad dream.

996
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,315
Where's my dad? I want my dad.

997
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,778
Lie here and relax
and I’ll go get your dad.

998
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,204
SEATON: Mr. Gardner?
Mrs. Gardner?

999
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,668
Hello?

1000
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,474
Carol Anne.

1001
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,960
DONNA: And they
thought it was her.

1002
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,285
Carol Anne?

1003
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,792
Carol Anne!

1004
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,003
PAT: Bruce!

1005
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,839
Bruce?

1006
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,483
Carol Anne?

1007
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,695
Carol Anne!

1008
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,572
Bruce!

1009
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,657
I saw her.

1010
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,075
You think you saw her.

1011
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,952
I saw her, damn it.

1012
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:52,038
Your daughter's upstairs, a
shivering, emotional wreck.

1013
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,583
Then you run out on me to chase
after that evil little brat again.

1014
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,586
Don't you understand? Don't
you see what she's doing?

1015
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,255
It's just like Dr. Seaton said.

1016
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,591
Nothing Seaton said explains
what happened tonight.

1017
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,845
Come on.

1018
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,402
CAROL ANNE: The man!
The ugly man!

1019
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,749
Remember what Tangina said.

1020
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:51,991
Open!

1021
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,213

BRUCE: Help!

1025
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,314
PAT: Help!

1026
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,650
Help!

1027
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:28,403
<i>TANGINA: Outside in!</i>

1028
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,032
PAT: Help! Help us!

1029
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,119
Help! Help!

1030
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,040
Outside in!

1031
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,400
Tangina gave this to me.

1032
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,487
She gave this to us!

1033
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,949
She's trying to save us.

1034
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,742
She's trying to
bring us through this!

1035
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:18,244
It's a lie!

1036
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,496
It's not true, any of this!
Oh, baby.

1037
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,789
It's not true. You're a liar!

1038
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,250
This... None of it's
true. You're a liar.

1039
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,585
She's trying to
get us through, Pat.

1040
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,129
She's trying to save our lives!
You're a liar.

1041
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,506
Just hold on, Pat. Just hold on.

1042
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,343
Just hold on, baby.

1043
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,430
Just hold on.

1044
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,278
No!

1045
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,452
Who are you?

1046
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:48,584
What do you want?

1047
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,294
<i>You!</i>

1048
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,095
Bruce!

1049
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:03,177
It's not cold anymore.

1050
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,930
She said we could do it!

1051
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,682
She said we could beat 'em!

1052
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,392
It's over, baby!

1053
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,227
It's over, darlin'!

1054
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,603
Oh, I want to believe that.

1055
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,438
What? Oh, believe it!

1056
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,399
Believe it!

1057
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:19,985
It's finished and
we did it together.

1058
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,259
Look at you.

1059
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:45,845
You two are pitiful.

1060
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,890
You know what? No, I don't wanna know.
I understand these things.

1061
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:53,394
Anyway, everybody went home.
And it went fine. I locked up.

1062
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:57,022
You two can read about it
tomorrow in the society columns.

1063
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,442
Newlyweds.

1064
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:02,945
Oh! Donna's been lookin' for you.
She called.

1065
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:05,156
She and Carol Anne are
upstairs with that shrink,

1066
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,866
what's-his-name
from the school.

1067
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,492
Maybe, you ought to
talk to him, honey.

1068
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,620
He's probably never met
anybody with a garage fetish.

1069
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:14,999
Manana, y'all.

1070
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,172
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley,
how are you tonight?

1071
01:19:38,198 --> 01:19:39,899
I, uh... I have been
doing some plumbing.

1072
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:41,150
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1073
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,994
What inconvenience?
We didn't have a problem.

1074
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,362
Well, if there was a problem,
I'm really very sorry.

1075
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,782
But the hot water's
gonna be on very soon.

1076
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:53,412
Well, I had to say somethin'.
I mean, look at us.

1077
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:56,874
I know. I didn't get much use
out of last year's salary, huh?

1078
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,793
I think you look great wet.

1079
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,961
Well, you can lie like
that anytime you want to.

1080
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,379
I usually do.

1081
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,714
I know.

1082
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,969
I can't wait to get upstairs,
stretch out in bed and...

1083
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:10,846
Act normal.

1084
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,140
Oh, getting upstairs
sounds great.

1085
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,809
What have you got in mind?

1086
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,144
Packing up everything that
belongs to that little brat

1087
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,605
and sending her
home to my sister.

1088
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,151
It wasn't her fault.

1089
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,780
<i>KANE: Yеs, it is!</i>

1090
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,728
Oh, my God.

1091
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,198
Outside in. What?

1092
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:19,743
BRUCE: Damn it, that's it! Outside in.
That's what Tangina said.

1093
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,704
He controls the inside,
but not the outside.

1094
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:24,123
We can still get to him.
Come on!

1095
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,375
Don't look down.

1096
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:59,027
AII right, hold onto this.

1097
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,821
No matter what
happens, don't let go.

1098
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,030
Okay.

1099
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,922
Fuckin' son of a bitch.

1100
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:42,321
Bruce!

1101
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,239
Bruce!

1102
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:52,956
Carol Anne!

1103
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:54,958
Go away, Pat!

1104
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,503
He doesn't want them!
He only wants me!

1105
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,840
You don't love me. You
don't want me here!

1106
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,259
My parents
don't love me either.

1107
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,011
They sent me away.

1108
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,597
Kane loves me! Kane wants me!

1109
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:14,228
Give me Tangina's necklace and you
can have Bruce and Donna back.

1110
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,104
They're your family.

1111
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,190
I’ll go with Kane.

1112
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,651
Your mom and dad do love you!

1113
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,445
They love you very much,

1114
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,156
and I love you, too!

1115
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,242
It's hard for me
to show it sometimes,

1116
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,868
but I do love you.

1117
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,453
No! Save your family!

1118
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:34,373
They're the ones who mean
something to you, not me.

1119
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:36,041
That's not true!

1120
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,794
You are part of my family!

1121
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,756
You and Donna
are like my children.

1122
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,552
I love you, Carol Anne, and
I’ll do anything to prove that!

1123
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,304
You've got to believe me!

1124
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,014
No! Go away!

1125
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,391
Carol Anne!

1126
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:53,433
<i>KANE: Go away!</i>

1127
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,195
Bruce?

1128
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:53,118
Bruce?

1129
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:57,622
Bruce!

1130
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,585
Bruce!

1131
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:07,924
Donna?

1132
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:13,013
Carol Anne?

1133
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,268
Tangina!

1134
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:21,813
Bruce!

1135
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,403
Oh, God!

1136
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,119
Where are you, Kane?

1137
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,455
Where have you taken my family?

1138
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,832
I want them back!

1139
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:44,378
Tangina said
you can't take them

1140
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,922
as long as someone
here loves them.

1141
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:49,966
I love them.

1142
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,805
And I have this to protect me.

1143
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,493
<i>KANE: The necklace!</i>

1144
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:26,336
<i>KANE: Give me the necklace.</i>

1145
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:27,754
No!

1146
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,881
<i>The necklace!</i>

1147
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,007
No!

1148
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,626
TANGINA: Kane!

1149
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,839
Give her back her family.

1150
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:16,428
You don't need them!
You don't need Carol Anne!

1151
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,388
I can lead you into the light!

1152
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:23,810
I have the knowledge
and the power!

1153
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,912
No! Tangina, don't!

1154
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,290
Tell me how to use the necklace,
so I can save all of you.

1155
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,626
Thank you, Pat,

1156
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:50,045
but this is the
way it has to be.

1157
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,256
Say goodbye to
Carol Anne for me.

1158
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:56,760
Tell her I’ll always love her,

1159
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:01,056
and that her nightmare is over.

1160
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,978
Tangina!

1161
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,858
Tangina.

1162
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:18,782
Tangina, wait!

1163
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,328
Where are they?

1164
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:38,802
<i>BRUCE: Pat.</i>

1165
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:45,934
Bruce.

1166
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,448
Bruce.

1167
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,566
She did it.

1168
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:37,861
She saved us.

1169
01:33:56,804 --> 01:34:33,804
