1
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,250
(screaming and crying within)

2
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:57,393
Doktor Gruber!

3
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,691
Herr Doktor!

4
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:05,269
Herr West!

5
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,693
Herr West!
Raus comen!

6
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:13,648
(crash within)

7
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:17,788
Move back.

8
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:34,053
Mein Gott!

9
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,116
(screaming)

10
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:40,496
No, you idiots!
You'll ruin my notes!

11
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,262
I have to record his
vital signs!

12
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,408
No!

13
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,241
Doktor Gruber?!
Wie Gehtsen?!

14
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:56,718
Doctor Gruber?

15
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:14,681
Er ist tot.

16
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,965
Of course he's dead -
the dosage was too large.

17
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:21,445
- You killed him!
- No, I did not.

18
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,656
I gave him life.

19
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,259
Alright, we'll zap her again.

20
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:20,551
Charge up the paddles.

21
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:24,801
- Come on, let's go!
- Sorry, Doctor.

22
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,014
Hold the compressions.

23
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:29,617
Clear!

24
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:36,113
Straight line.

25
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:40,117
Alright, let's call it.

26
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:42,037
Cain.

27
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,997
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

28
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,624
Cain, we have done everything
that can be done for this woman.

29
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:51,129
She has not responded.

30
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:54,791
She's gone!

31
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:08,613
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

32
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,613
A good doctor knows when to stop.

33
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,783
- Doctor Harris..
- Tag her...

34
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,470
...and take her to the morgue.

35
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,159
Gangway.

36
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:31,376
Mister Cain.

37
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,082
Hey, Ace -
I've got another one for you.

38
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:37,054
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

39
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,052
Thanks.

40
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,512
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here...

41
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:46,777
...nobody wants in, and
ain't nobody gettin' out.

42
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,911
Yup.

43
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:17,072
I'm sorry Dan, I didn't
mean to scare you.

44
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,076
It wasn't bad, Dean Halsey.
I didn't know anybody was here.

45
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,834
You mean anybody else.

46
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:25,248
Dan, this is Herbert West. He'll be
joining you in your third year.

47
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,111
He was doing independent research
in Switzerland with Dr. Gruber

48
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,111
shortly before he died.

49
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,586
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain -

50
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:35,755
- one of Miskatonic Medical's best young
hopes for the future of medicine.

51
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,594
- What were you researching?
- Death.

52
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,934
Ah, Alan! We don't see you
around here much anymore.

53
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,313
I was just showing our newest student,
Herbert West, the not so Grand Tour.

54
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,529
This should interest you, Carl -
he worked with Hans Gruber.

55
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:53,650
Ah, Mr. West?

56
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,955
This is our eminent brain researcher
and "grant machine"

57
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:58,790
Dr Carl Hill.

58
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:02,460
I know your work,
Dr Hill - quite well.

59
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:06,339
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is...

60
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,296
...interesting...

61
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:11,631
...though derivative of Dr Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

62
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:15,348
So derivative that in Europe
it's considered plaigerized.

63
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:19,477
And your support of the 12 minute limit
on the life of the brain stem after death...

64
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,691
Six to twelve minutes, Mister, uh...
- West.

65
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:24,943
Herbert West.

66
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:26,946
Frankly, Doctor, uh...

67
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:28,152
...Hill?...

68
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,320
...your work on brain
death is outdated.

69
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:35,539
Carl, while I remember

70
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,530
we're having a grand
committee meeting Thursday.

71
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,916
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

72
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,799
Well, I'd love to, Alan -
looking forward to it.

73
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:46,334
And looking forward to seeing you

74
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,011
in class, Mister West.

75
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,427
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,039
No! No! No!

77
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Yes! Oh! Yes! Oh!

78
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,356
Oh! Rufus!

79
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:40,895
I have to go.

80
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,859
No, stay.

81
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,576
- Dad knows I'm here.
- I don't care what Dean Halsey knows.

82
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:51,788
Be resasonable.

83
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:55,747
If I didn't come home
one night...just one night.

84
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,916
What would he do?
Expell me?

85
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:01,755
He's out of touch
with the times.

86
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,046
It's just the way he is.

87
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,299
The world's last
living Puritan.

88
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,057
I really hate it.

89
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,304
The day that you graduate...

90
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,773
...the minute you get your
M.D., I'll marry you.

91
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:25,240
And I'll help you, and
I'll be with you

92
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,407
as much as I can until then.

93
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,158
I promise.

94
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,827
Back to Square One.

95
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:38,287
Well, at least it gives me a
chance to house break you.

96
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,664
House broken, eh?

97
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,347
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, My Dear.

98
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,258
What are you doing?

99
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:53,289
Yeaaaow!

100
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,314
Dan! (laughs)

101
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,720
Dan, stop! Don't!

102
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:00,959
(evil laugh)

103
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,690
Dan!

104
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:03,359
- Stop it!
- Oh, My Pretty!

105
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,402
I don't like that!

106
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:06,443
No!

107
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:10,743
Ah, there's not a jury in the
world that will convict me...

108
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,911
(laughs)
Doctor Dan!

109
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:17,131
Don't! Come on, stop!

110
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:19,873
- I'm going - I have to go!
- Come here!

111
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,180
Hi. Can I help you?

112
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,774
- You're here about the apartment?
- Yes.

113
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:36,691
Didn't we meet this morning, ah...

114
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:38,736
West.
Herbert West.

115
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,856
...West. Excuse me just one second.

116
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:46,865
- Come in.
- Thank you.

117
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:55,834
- I startled you.
- Yes, you did.

118
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:01,887
May I introduce my fiance,
Megan Halsey.

119
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:03,806
Miss Halsey.

120
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,475
Mister West.

121
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,555
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr West.

122
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,351
Herbert.

123
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,657
So, you've just come
from Europe?

124
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,199
Switzerland

125
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:29,209
What was Dr Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

126
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,788
Yes, pretty famous.
Does this building have a basement?

127
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,940
Oh, yes.

128
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,040
Yes

129
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,141
I think this will be just fine!

130
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,597
I have my things outside.
Shall I move in now?

131
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,773
Ah, look - I have to go.

132
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:56,262
I think you and Mr West
have a lot to discuss

133
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,490
before you decide anything.

134
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,741
Oh, I've decided!

135
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,454
- Well...I'd like to...
- You'll never even know that I'm here.

136
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:05,703
- Dan...
- That goes on the first of the month.

137
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,576
Mister West.

138
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,080
Miss Halsey?

139
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:12,295
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

140
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:18,218
There was no more
I could learn there.

141
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,888
Do we have a deal?

142
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:29,847
Done

143
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:32,772
Done

144
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,190
You make the incision at
the base of the skull...

145
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,049
...cutting away enough of the facia...

146
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,180
...to get your fingers in.

147
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:06,477
And then, grasping firmly
with both hands...

148
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:09,728
...you pull the skin

149
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:12,444
forward over the head.

150
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,030
It's very much like peeling
a large orange.

151
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,990
Once the skull is
plainly visible...

152
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,535
...you take the bone saw...

153
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,210
...and you cut around
the perimeter.

154
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,643
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen...

155
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,644
...the human brain.

156
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,479
Once the brain stem of
an individual -

157
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:54,480
- I'm talking about the
reticular activating system -

158
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,108
- heart regulation, respiratory center -

159
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,864
- once these activities cease...

160
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:04,162
...the brain can only survive an
additional 6 to 12 minutes.

161
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,871
Six to twelve minutes.

162
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:11,713
Until...

163
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:17,760
...brain death brings about an
irreversible conclusion.

164
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,272
We all want to retain our
personalities

165
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,696
in some idyllic afterlife.

166
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,578
We all pray for
some miracle...

167
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,447
some drug,

168
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,080
potion, pill...

169
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,005
Perhaps, though,

170
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,002
it takes something else.

171
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,420
Perhaps it takes desire -

172
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,631
- an obsessive desire.

173
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:57,556
Perhaps it takes...

174
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:05,734
We will discuss the
location of the will

175
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:08,862
in the brain structure
at another time.

176
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:12,032
Mister West!

177
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:15,578
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

178
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:19,077
Class dismissed.

179
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:24,291
How can you teach such drivel!
These people are here to learn,

180
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:26,463
and you're closing their minds
before they even have a chance!

181
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:27,838
What are you here for,
Mr West?!

182
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,880
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas...

183
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,434
...then at least
you'd have ideas!

184
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,174
Mister West!

185
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:39,140
It is going to be
a pleasure to fail you.

186
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:50,026
I would like to propose a toast.

187
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,601
To the National
Science Foundation

188
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,665
for recognizing the genius
of Dr Carl Hill...

189
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,043
...and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

190
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,496
its largest grant ever!

191
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:07,542
Your new laser drill is going to
revolutionize neurosurgery.

192
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:11,631
To the Foundation -
and to Miskatonic!

193
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,328
It's alright, Sweetheart,
you can drink up.

194
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,420
We're celebrating!

195
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,820
I know, Daddy, but
I have to go soon.

196
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:25,358
After preparing such a feast?
You must be tired.

197
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,450
I have a study date.

198
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:27,442
With Daniel?

199
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:29,102
Yes

200
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,327
Daniel Cain?

201
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,586
Uh huh.

202
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:35,623
Herbert West has moved
in with him, hasn't he?

203
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,300
For the time being.

204
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,810
(doorbell)
Oh, that must be him. Excuse me.

205
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:47,459
So...your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

206
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:51,593
You think that's wise, Alan?

207
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,927
- Dan!
- Hello, Sir.

208
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,770
Dr Hill.

209
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:58,392
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

210
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,687
Actually, we have some
work to do.

211
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,233
Why don't you study here?

212
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,402
I'll have her home soon,
don't worry about it.

213
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,620
Well then...
one last toast.

214
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,538
To Meg...

215
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,209
...my esteemed colleague's

216
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,710
capable, beautiful

217
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,004
loving daughter...

218
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:26,602
...the obsession of all who
fall under her spell.

219
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,525
Dan...

220
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,564
No.

221
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,113
Please!

222
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,119
- Okay, what is it?
- I don't know, it's...

223
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,622
Look - it's not you, really, it's...

224
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:59,376
...just a lot of little things.
- Like what?

225
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,876
Well - West is always in his
room with the door closed.

226
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:06,345
I mean, do you ever see him?
Does he ever eat?

227
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:09,641
I told you - he's a little cracked!

228
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:12,768
He bothers you, too.

229
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,599
No, don't be ridiculous.

230
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:17,075
Rufus is terrified of him.

231
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,802
When West comes in,
he runs and hides!

232
00:20:19,362 --> 00:20:21,983
Rufus runs and hides all the time.
It's standard cat activity.

233
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:23,470
But not when we're together.

234
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:26,975
Then he's all over us, trying to
get your attention, and...

235
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:29,867
Where is he? I haven't
seen him since we got here.

236
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,197
It's okay - he's around here...

237
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,629
I haven't even heard him.

238
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,613
Usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

239
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:44,591
Rufus... Rufus...Rufus

240
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,892
Come on, you fat cat.

241
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:50,488
Here. Kitty.

242
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,229
Where are you now,
you mad animal.

243
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:58,187
Don't you try to hide from me.

244
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:00,696
Rufus

245
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,097
Where are you, boy?

246
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,622
Here, Kitty!

247
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:09,652
Here, Kitty!

248
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,510
Rufus! Hey Boy!

249
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,436
Rufus?

250
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,233
Rufus?...Rufus?

251
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,396
Rufus?

252
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:10,229
Rufus, are you in here?

253
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,096
Here, Boy!

254
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:18,926
Here, Kitty.

255
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,542
Rufus?

256
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,551
Oh, Dan, I think it's...

257
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:46,436
What are you doing in my room?
How dare you come in my room!

258
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,940
Dan! Dan!

259
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,018
What's the matter?

260
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,689
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

261
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,529
Meg, what the hell are
you doing here?

262
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:56,067
Would you please leave - now?!

263
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:58,432
Easy, Herbert!
Come on.

264
00:22:58,701 --> 00:22:59,566
In the fridge!

265
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,661
I was going to show you.

266
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:13,997
Shut up.

267
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,219
What happened?

268
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,008
It was dead when I found it.

269
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:26,896
You killed him.
He hated you!

270
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,400
It suffocated.

271
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:37,074
It knocked the garbage over
and got its head stuck in a jar.

272
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,887
You weren't home, so I
put it in there.

273
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,550
I didn't think you would want
to find it like that.

274
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,555
I did not want to
stink the place up.

275
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,082
I was going to show you.

276
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:46,912
You couldn't call or
write a note?

277
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:50,379
I was busy pushing bodies around -
and what would a note say, Dan:

278
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,007
"Cat Dead - Details Later"?
I knew you were fond of it.

279
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:56,177
You killed him! I know
you did! He killed him!

280
00:23:56,388 --> 00:23:58,200
Besides, I do not like
people in my room!

281
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,555
Alright, that's enough.

282
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:09,312
I think you'd both
better leave - now!

283
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:11,437
- What the hell is this?
- That is none of your business!

284
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:12,485
Yeah, I think it is!

285
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:13,948
Just as it is none
of my business that

286
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,700
you're sleeping with
Dean Halsey's daughter!

287
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:20,739
You know, I would not
want to see a fellow student,

288
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:23,785
especially one as promising as
yourself, be thrown out of school -

289
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,664
out of the profession -
on morals grounds.

290
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,590
Well, I think Dr Halsey
just might understand.

291
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,392
Oh, do you?

292
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:34,344
Well, you may well
be right.

293
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,594
Are you sure you
want ot find out?

294
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:44,428
(cat screams)

295
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:51,205
(cat screams)

296
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:25,390
Herbert!

297
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,720
Herbert!

298
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:29,255
Herbert!

299
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:31,108
You hear that sound?!

300
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:34,909
West! West!

301
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,033
West, what is that?!

302
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,078
(cat screams)

303
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,877
(cat screaming)

304
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:07,237
Get it off of me!!

305
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,651
Cain!!

306
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,905
Get out of here!!

307
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,917
Get it off of me!!

308
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:30,468
- What the hell is it?!
- Later! Later!

309
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:39,685
There it is!

310
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,086
No!

311
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
(cat howls)

312
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,240
Look out!

313
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,231
There it goes!

314
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,365
(cat cries)

315
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,456
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

316
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:20,451
(cat screams)

317
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:37,980
How?

318
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,171
Look out!

319
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:55,825
It's really quite simple -

320
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,852
all life is a physical and
chemical process, correct?

321
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:01,161
It stands to reason
that if one could

322
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,669
find extremely fresh specimens

323
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,178
and re-charge that
chemical process -

324
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,650
Bang! - we'd have re-animation.

325
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,201
The theory is not new, West.

326
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:10,451
But my "re-agent" is.

327
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:12,659
Read!

328
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,375
"With various animating solutions

329
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,094
"I have killed and brought to
animated life a number of

330
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,466
"rabbits and pigs -
cats and dogs."

331
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,551
I have broken the 6 to 12
minute barrier.

332
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,551
I've conquered brain death!

333
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:35,729
"With the higher animals and the
increased strength of the solution

334
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:38,397
"the reaction has become
more violent

335
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:42,027
"and my research has
become more difficult."

336
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,647
Which is why I need
you to help me.

337
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,495
- Help you?
- You are the perfect person to assist me.

338
00:28:48,705 --> 00:28:51,908
You are hard working, bright -
people respect you...

339
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,708
and you have access to
certain authorities.

340
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,538
We can defeat death!

341
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:04,216
We can achieve every doctor's
dream. You'll be famous...

342
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:06,513
...and live lifetimes.

343
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,056
You haven't done this on people?!

344
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,685
I've done all I can here.
I'll need new lab space.

345
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:21,984
You will help me?

346
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:24,738
- No!
- Why - because it's mad?

347
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:26,411
No - because I don't
believe you!

348
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:28,448
How can you say that?
You've seen the results!

349
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:30,823
No! Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

350
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,221
You drugged him and reduced
his vital signs...

351
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,641
...you lowered his body temperature.
He couldn't have been dead!

352
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,996
Do you agree that he's dead now?

353
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:39,632
Do you agree that he's dead now?!

354
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,097
West, no!

355
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:55,349
West, stop!

356
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:56,939
I'll show you.

357
00:29:57,654 --> 00:29:58,496
Then you'll help me.

358
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,823
- No!
- Yes, you will.

359
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,750
That is why I brought the infernal
beast back to life in the first place.

360
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:12,126
- The brain?
- Of course.

361
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:19,127
Don't expect it to tango -
it has a broken back.

362
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,762
(cat crying)
God!

363
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:28,310
Why does it make that noise?

364
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:31,353
Birth is always painful.

365
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,613
- It was dead!
- Twice.

366
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:42,416
(Meg screams)

367
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:45,120
- It's him!
- What are you doing here?

368
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:48,036
- It's Rufus!
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

369
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,610
Oh, my God!

370
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:52,922
(cat screaming)

371
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:01,757
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue!

372
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,472
Mister Cain...

373
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:09,223
...I'm surprised.
- No, I've seen it!

374
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:13,149
He brought back a dead
animal - a cat! Back to life!

375
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:16,270
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr Cain,

376
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:19,277
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr West.

377
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:21,117
I know he's unstable, but

378
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:24,163
I've seen the results -
so has your daughter!

379
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:27,248
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

380
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,537
She walked into an
experiment.

381
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:32,501
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?!

382
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:34,716
I never intended to
involve her.

383
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:37,595
Tomorrow morning you will
submit to me a written apology

384
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,095
for this entire affair.

385
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:42,017
These experiments were
clearly beyond the scope

386
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:44,767
of your legitimate studies.
They have obviously interfered

387
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,552
with your ability to do
your classwork.

388
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:51,284
If any equipment from the
hospital or the laboratories of

389
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:53,611
Miskatonic University were
involved in any of this

390
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,699
unauthorized activity, criminal
charges may be pressed!

391
00:31:56,908 --> 00:32:01,408
You will in any case, have
your student loan recinded!

392
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:03,827
My loan?

393
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:07,877
I won't be able to
continue school.

394
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:11,560
As for Mr West, he need submit
no apology - you may tell him

395
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:14,177
that he may continue with his
research without

396
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,065
the impediment of an education.

397
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:19,621
As of now, he is no longer
a student at this university.

398
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:22,308
Sir, can we please discuss this?

399
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,429
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

400
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,356
That will be all, Mr Cain.

401
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:38,824
Don't take this out on Meg.

402
00:32:39,705 --> 00:32:40,867
She tried to stop me.

403
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,867
I said that will be all.

404
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,469
- They just keep on coming, don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

405
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:14,156
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have ya?

406
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,489
Yeah - one meatball
run over by a semi.

407
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:18,650
Eeew!

408
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,759
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

409
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,781
- Yeah.
- I might go get me some coffee.

410
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,287
- Take your time.
- Got it.

411
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:35,884
Meatball?

412
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,641
Put your shoes on.

413
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,909
- If we get caught...
- What will they do...

414
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:56,280
...embalm us?

415
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,201
Let's go.

416
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:18,638
"Burn victim."

417
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,984
Here's your meatball.

418
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:33,068
"Shotgun wound to the head."

419
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:37,116
Oh, God - he's rotten!

420
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,329
- "Malpractice."
- Shit!

421
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:44,877
Let's go - we're not
going to find anything!

422
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:47,707
Wait!...Wait!

423
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,423
Yes, I think you.

424
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:56,215
How long?

425
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,846
He arrived early
this evening.

426
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,389
"John Doe" - apparently
just dropped dead.

427
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:04,728
No record of any damage.
Almost perfect!

428
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:07,937
- Why almost?
- Could be heart damage.

429
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,867
- Just find another one!
- No - we do not have time!

430
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:16,576
All we need tonight, is a
specific conscious reaction!

431
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,250
He's been dead for hours.

432
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:20,658
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness

433
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,658
will justify proceeding!

434
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,341
Start the recorder.

435
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:29,469
Start the damn recorder!

436
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:34,100
Make the entry.

437
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:37,891
October...

438
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:39,805
- Tenth.
- Tenth.

439
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,056
Subject: Male

440
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:43,440
Age?

441
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,987
Age: early twenties.

442
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:49,781
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

443
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:54,619
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

444
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:59,325
Cause Of Death:

445
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,880
Uh - What?

446
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:08,709
- Heart failure.
- Heart failure.

447
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:17,074
- Time: 10:33 PM.
- 10:33 PM.

448
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:21,776
Fifteen CC's.

449
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:26,739
Fifteen CC's of re-agent
being administered.

450
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,994
- We're getting married!
- He's mad.

451
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:39,500
I've seen this happen to
medical students before...

452
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:41,000
...good ones!

453
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:43,712
Doctor Harris, is Mr Cain
loose in this hospital?

454
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,047
In the morgue, I think, Doctor.

455
00:36:46,263 --> 00:36:49,134
I specifically told Dr Riley
to suspend him

456
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,220
and take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

457
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,770
Dr Riley's been in emergency
surgery for 4 hours.

458
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,606
I haven't seen him.

459
00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:01,278
Time elapsed?

460
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:05,902
Fifteen seconds.

461
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,618
Something should have
happened by now!

462
00:37:11,423 --> 00:37:13,498
(telephone rings)

463
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:24,302
It's not working.

464
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:26,504
Let's get out of here!

465
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,726
Obviously, the human
dosage factor is unknown.

466
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:32,509
Increasing the dosage -
20 CC's of re-agent.

467
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,604
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

468
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,140
Ohhh...

469
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:01,506
Damn!

470
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,674
Page Mr Cain and have him report
to the Level L security desk

471
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,381
and make sure that she
stays right here!

472
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,862
You can't stop me.
I followed you here

473
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,382
and I'm going to follow
you until you listen to me...

474
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,783
- I love him!
- You are my daughter...

475
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,759
and you will do as
you are told!

476
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,311
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

477
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,101
Mr Cain will be up soon.
You can discuss it then.

478
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:20,982
Don't blame him, Daddy!

479
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,409
We failed!

480
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:26,866
Come on - let's go! Somebody
could be coming any minute!

481
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,406
He failed!
Not I!

482
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:32,915
(paging system)
"Mr Cain - Mr Daniel Cain"

483
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,254
"Please report to the
security desk, Level L"

484
00:38:37,038 --> 00:38:37,964
Oh, God!

485
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,977
Cover him up.
Let's Go.

486
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,866
- Let's Go!
- Alright!

487
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:50,301
Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh!

488
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:03,567
Grab him!

489
00:39:08,027 --> 00:39:09,527
Stop!!

490
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:15,085
He heard me!

491
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:25,508
Cain?!

492
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:33,983
Cain, open up this door!

493
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:35,977
Help!!

494
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:39,147
Help!!

495
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:41,402
Is West in there with you?!

496
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,279
You're in a lot of trouble!
Both of you!!

497
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:08,009
No!!

498
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,109
Let go of him!

499
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:34,456
Stop!!
For God's sake, stop!!

500
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,917
Dan...

501
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,092
...look out.

502
00:40:55,158 --> 00:40:56,158
Ohhh!

503
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:08,994
Come on!

504
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:12,163
Find the recorder!

505
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:16,095
Herbert - No!

506
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:18,645
Did you see him, Dan?
He listened to me!

507
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,856
It made a conscious act!

508
00:41:20,268 --> 00:41:22,593
He heard you as an animal would!

509
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,098
No, no - you can't be serious!

510
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:29,100
You may be right. It had
probably been dead too long...

511
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,860
...wasn't fresh enough!

512
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,861
We probably only revived
the senses and the instincts -

513
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,782
so come on!
Help me get him up.

514
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,080
- Is he dead?
- Of course -would you give me a hand?!

515
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,823
He interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

516
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,868
Granted, it was an accident, but
this is the freshest body

517
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,507
we could come across save of
killing one ourselves

518
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,364
and every moment that we
spend talking about it

519
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:52,218
costs us results!!
Now, will you give me a hand?

520
00:41:54,797 --> 00:41:55,920
Dan...

521
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,974
...we can bring him
back to life!

522
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:05,931
Yes

523
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,790
Now - get the recorder!

524
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:26,457
Find my serum!

525
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,671
This is a dream.

526
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:33,419
Fiction

527
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:36,718
Here - get his other hand.

528
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,562
Oh, good.

529
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,892
Unbreakable plastic...

530
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,647
...one of Man's few durable
inventions.

531
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:51,654
Certainly more durable
than this.

532
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:54,450
We need you in the
crash room.

533
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,493
Coming.

534
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:29,652
Twelve CC's being
administered...

535
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:33,866
...the dosage lessened in accordance
with the freshness of the subject.

536
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:49,251
Five seconds.

537
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,590
Come on!

538
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:57,347
I'll show you.

539
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:02,472
Fifteen seconds.
I'll show you!

540
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:06,616
Seventeen seconds!
Re-animation in 17 seconds!

541
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,455
The eyes opened!

542
00:44:07,824 --> 00:44:09,235
Dr Halsey?

543
00:44:10,076 --> 00:44:13,446
You once did me a favor by letting
me into your medical school!

544
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:16,665
Doctor - welcome back
to life!

545
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,169
Daddy?
Dan?

546
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:45,071
Damned bitch!

547
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:48,646
Meg?!

548
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:56,221
Dan - what is it?
Are you alright?

549
00:45:00,256 --> 00:45:02,249
Dan - it's trying to speak!
The recorder!

550
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:05,751
Rrrrraaaaahhhh!

551
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,068
No!!

552
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:11,093
Daddy!
Daddy don't!

553
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:12,601
No, Meg - don't go near!

554
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,433
What the hell happened here!
Dan, you alright?

555
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,179
Who's that?

556
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:23,193
Uh...that is Dean Halsey.

557
00:45:23,865 --> 00:45:26,732
You see, I came down here
to visit Mr Cain...

558
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,480
...who was here working

559
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:31,506
and Halsey entered, and
started ranting at us...

560
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,006
...rather irrationally.

561
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,284
No! He was just angry!

562
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,545
Daddy!

563
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:41,792
- Who's that over there?
- Uh, just a corpse.

564
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:45,462
You see, Halsey came in and
grabbed...that thing.

565
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,180
and, well...went crazy.

566
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:50,636
Dean Halsey?!
Dean Halsey!

567
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:52,108
(wails)

568
00:45:52,354 --> 00:45:53,854
I'm calling the police!

569
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,669
Oh! Daddy!

570
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,833
(Halsey wails)

571
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:09,496
Shock.

572
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:11,238
Don't worry.

573
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:29,991
(yelling)

574
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:40,024
Daddy...

575
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,359
He can't hear you, or see you.

576
00:46:44,577 --> 00:46:46,119
That's a one-way mirror.

577
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,575
What is wrong with him, Doctor?

578
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:54,417
Will he ever be...

579
00:46:54,629 --> 00:46:57,299
Until we know exactly
what happened to him...

580
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:00,378
...there is no way to determine
his course of recovery.

581
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,428
That's why I need you to
sign a release

582
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,950
so I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

583
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:12,928
Is that absolutely
necessary, Doctor Hill?

584
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:16,110
I know how difficult this
must be for you.

585
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:22,242
But I'm convinced your father's
problem is neurological.

586
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:25,529
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

587
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:31,368
You must trust me.

588
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:47,928
I want to take a look at
the right frontal lobes.

589
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:52,436
- I'll open the skull here...
- I...don't want to know!

590
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,854
Just help him.

591
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,875
Please, Doctor.

592
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:22,840
Please let me talk to him.

593
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,508
No.

594
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:29,105
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

595
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:34,855
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

596
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:41,326
Or if you're ever lonely.

597
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,455
I know you're all by
yourself now.

598
00:48:49,433 --> 00:48:50,864
(screams)

599
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:00,720
I'm going to take care
of him, Doctor.

600
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,554
And I'm going to find out
what happened to him!

601
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:47,130
What are you doing here?

602
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:49,430
I've been waiting for you.

603
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,141
I had to tell you about him.

604
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:56,271
What did you do to him?

605
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:01,601
What did you and
West do to him?

606
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,359
It was horrible.

607
00:50:08,493 --> 00:50:09,656
I didn't...

608
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:13,700
What did you do to him?!

609
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,335
He's not insane.

610
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:28,794
He's dead.

611
00:50:30,476 --> 00:50:37,428
No...No!
You're insane! You're insane!

612
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:39,936
No, it's true, Meg.

613
00:50:40,653 --> 00:50:43,632
- It's true.
- No!

614
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:49,574
Daddy!

615
00:50:57,797 --> 00:51:01,083
I'm telling you, Meg.
Everything.

616
00:51:13,355 --> 00:51:14,766
Good evening, Mr West.

617
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:22,030
What do you want?

618
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:25,827
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrilates.

619
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:27,364
I don't have to talk to you.

620
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:28,907
Why his pulse is erratic.

621
00:51:29,122 --> 00:51:30,996
I told everything I know
to the police.

622
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,165
Why he cries out in pain.

623
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:34,836
You can leave now, Doctor!

624
00:51:35,045 --> 00:51:39,545
When we both know he is
quite dead.

625
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:49,393
Hmmm...Interesting little
laboratory you have here.

626
00:51:50,176 --> 00:51:53,265
Ah! Mr West!

627
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:55,518
I recognize this.

628
00:51:58,112 --> 00:51:59,310
What do you want?

629
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:03,068
Yes...we are both
scientists.

630
00:52:04,118 --> 00:52:06,618
Let us get to the point.

631
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:13,042
I want your discovery...

632
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:17,588
...whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

633
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,050
It is not the appearance of life -
it is life. This is not magic.

634
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:24,466
As you say - I am a scientist.

635
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:27,305
I'll have you locked up
for a madman...

636
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,228
...or a murderer.

637
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,404
You will do...

638
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:43,491
...what I tell you to do.

639
00:53:15,821 --> 00:53:18,028
Ingenious, Mr West.

640
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:23,492
Your extention of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite...

641
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:27,247
...brilliant!

642
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:49,021
- Dr Hill examined your father?
- Yes.

643
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:52,729
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

644
00:53:55,906 --> 00:53:57,235
He'll find out.

645
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:00,616
Eventually, he'll find out.

646
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:04,746
Let us see...

647
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,208
...my new serum at work, eh?

648
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:13,298
Dead cat tissue.

649
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,180
The re-agent.

650
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,669
Magnificent!

651
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:07,936
Yes, Mr West...

652
00:55:09,078 --> 00:55:12,817
...I will be famous!

653
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:26,128
Plagiarist!

654
00:56:12,415 --> 00:56:14,415
Yes...

655
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:20,955
...parts.

656
00:56:22,481 --> 00:56:25,186
I've never done whole...

657
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,517
...parts.

658
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:18,915
West...

659
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:26,800
Yes, Doctor.

660
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:29,127
It's Herbert West.

661
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:32,735
What are you thinking?
How do you feel?

662
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,017
You...

663
00:57:38,293 --> 00:57:40,099
You?

664
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:48,455
Baaaaastaaaaard!!

665
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:23,161
(screams)
Dan!

666
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:26,044
My God! What has Hill
done to him?!

667
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,561
Looks like a laser drill.

668
00:59:36,149 --> 00:59:38,649
Your father's been
lobotomized.

669
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:28,038
My work!!

670
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,956
My work!!

671
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,788
- What's going on?
- My work!

672
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,164
It's all gone!

673
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:38,625
He took my serum - except for
what I have upstairs.

674
01:00:38,842 --> 01:00:41,333
Who!!
What happened here!

675
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:42,467
Hill.

676
01:00:43,138 --> 01:00:45,843
Hill took my serum, my notes -
everything!

677
01:00:46,058 --> 01:00:47,600
Herbert, you're insane!
What's happened here!

678
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,008
I had to kill him!!

679
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,766
What?

680
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,440
He's dead?

681
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:56,902
Not anymore.

682
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,824
No, Herbert!
This has got to stop!!

683
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:06,033
He tried to blackmail me, Dan!
And he wanted you to disappear!!

684
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:21,052
Oh - that's why he did it.

685
01:01:21,263 --> 01:01:22,461
What - you've seen Halsey?

686
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:24,140
He lobotomized him.

687
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,364
So he could control him
in case he ever tried

688
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,890
to talk or tell anybody
what happened!

689
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:30,766
So he could protect
"his discovery".

690
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:33,022
- Very clever.
- I've got to tell Meg.

691
01:01:33,776 --> 01:01:35,057
What does Meg have
to do with this?

692
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,480
Hill's got this weird file on her -

693
01:01:37,482 --> 01:01:40,157
full of napkins and hair
and photographs

694
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,160
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need on to her.

695
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:22,683
Yes...

696
01:03:37,869 --> 01:03:41,071
Alan...

697
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:50,204
Alan...

698
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:29,094
Yes, Alan...

699
01:04:30,676 --> 01:04:35,469
It's time for you

700
01:04:35,848 --> 01:04:42,106
to come out...now!

701
01:05:12,763 --> 01:05:14,388
Is that you, Dr Hill?

702
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:17,599
(muffled)
Yes, it's me!

703
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,016
Break time.

704
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:54,805
(gasps)

705
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,957
That's better!

706
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:51,494
(knock)
Meg?

707
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:53,570
It's Dan!

708
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:58,671
- I'm so afraid!
- What is it?

709
01:06:59,879 --> 01:07:01,711
What's the matter?

710
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:06,093
I don't know, I'm...

711
01:07:06,303 --> 01:07:08,739
...just worried about you.

712
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:10,719
Why?

713
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:18,145
I just feel horrible
about everything.

714
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:22,725
I guess I'm just
getting paranoid.

715
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:27,791
It's just...

716
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:31,062
...so hard to lose you.

717
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,331
You should go away.

718
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:39,837
Transfer to another school.

719
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,403
Don't worry about me.

720
01:07:44,678 --> 01:07:47,687
You're the one who
should get away...

721
01:07:49,767 --> 01:07:51,949
...go on with your life.

722
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:57,156
Find somebody.

723
01:07:57,817 --> 01:08:00,309
I tried to hate you.

724
01:08:03,114 --> 01:08:08,089
I wanted so much to hate you.

725
01:08:11,415 --> 01:08:13,991
I love you.

726
01:08:16,504 --> 01:08:18,177
Daddy!!

727
01:08:22,694 --> 01:08:24,825
No, Daddy!!

728
01:08:28,058 --> 01:08:31,854
Oh, no!! Daddy, don't!!

729
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:35,115
No!!

730
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,615
(screams)

731
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:49,488
(slow knock)
The door!

732
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:36,552
Oh, yes, Alan...

733
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:11,718
Ahhhhh!

734
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:25,277
Dan?...Dan?...Dan?!

735
01:10:26,019 --> 01:10:27,983
Come on!

736
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:33,567
Ah, well...you'll be alright.

737
01:10:34,177 --> 01:10:35,272
Meg!

738
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:38,230
Oh, my God.
Where, Herbert!

739
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:41,689
At the hospital, I imagine.
Can you stand up?

740
01:10:41,724 --> 01:10:42,669
Let's go.

741
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:57,191
Meg...

742
01:11:32,758 --> 01:11:36,524
I've always...

743
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:42,594
...admired your beauty, My Dear.

744
01:11:42,685 --> 01:11:49,299
I think I've always
loved you!

745
01:11:55,155 --> 01:12:00,230
And you will love me!

746
01:12:04,918 --> 01:12:07,481
You will!

747
01:12:09,464 --> 01:12:10,875
Please!

748
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:12,585
Please stop!

749
01:12:13,218 --> 01:12:14,677
Let me go!

750
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:18,805
That's it, my dearest Meg...

751
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:22,271
...more passion!

752
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:29,942
Yes, my love!

753
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:32,454
I must say,
Dr Hill...

754
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:35,342
...I'm very dissapointed in you.

755
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,668
You steal the secret of
Life and Death,

756
01:12:38,703 --> 01:12:42,204
and here you are, trysting
with a bubble headed co-ed.

757
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,512
You're not even a
second rate scientist.

758
01:12:45,503 --> 01:12:48,494
Ah! Mr West!

759
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:51,980
I'm actually glad to see you!

760
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:58,319
It saves me the trouble of
having to send for you!

761
01:12:58,325 --> 01:13:00,643
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

762
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,455
Who's going to believe a
talking head?

763
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,385
Get a job in a sideshow!

764
01:13:05,957 --> 01:13:11,393
Why an intelligent young man
like yourself...

765
01:13:12,074 --> 01:13:17,749
...should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake

766
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,062
of coming here to
challenge me!

767
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:25,600
Oh...I have a plan.

768
01:13:25,827 --> 01:13:30,372
So do I.

769
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:10,631
Enough!!

770
01:14:23,109 --> 01:14:27,822
It is I who will show
you power, Mr West.

771
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:29,930
My discovery...

772
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,574
...a laser surgical drill

773
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,651
makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy

774
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:41,889
which results in
total mastery

775
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:44,678
of the human will!

776
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,555
Re-animated subjects

777
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,743
have proven to be the best!

778
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:54,293
They will give me power!

779
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,296
Undreamed of power!

780
01:15:00,511 --> 01:15:01,565
Stay behind me.

781
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:10,175
Daddy, listen to me!
It's Megan! Megan!

782
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:12,018
Help! They'll kill her!

783
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:14,466
Then I'll give her life!

784
01:15:16,733 --> 01:15:19,065
Look at me!!

785
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,936
Aaahhhh!!

786
01:15:53,805 --> 01:15:55,305
What the f...

787
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:13,559
Aaaaahhhhh!!

788
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:24,297
Herbert, come on!
Come on!

789
01:16:24,675 --> 01:16:26,765
Wait! We're not through here!

790
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:29,031
Meg, no!

791
01:16:29,037 --> 01:16:31,027
No! Let me go!!

792
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:33,293
Have I told you,
I have a theory?!

793
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:36,502
Overdose!!!

794
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,057
Herbert!

795
01:17:49,729 --> 01:17:51,200
Look out!!

796
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:01,144
Daddy!!

797
01:18:01,438 --> 01:18:02,938
Let's go, Meg!

798
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:13,622
My notes!!

799
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:16,670
My notes!!

800
01:18:17,665 --> 01:18:19,942
Aaaaaagggg!

801
01:18:40,426 --> 01:18:41,672
Stop it!!

802
01:18:50,462 --> 01:18:52,274
Come on!!

803
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,634
Meg!

804
01:20:02,725 --> 01:20:03,917
My God, Megan!

805
01:20:03,952 --> 01:20:05,161
Take her to
Number Three!

806
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:14,376
Hurry! Hurry!

807
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:16,663
Activating.

808
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,006
Air on!

809
01:20:24,848 --> 01:20:25,965
Give it to me!

810
01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:32,703
Okay, everybody out!

811
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,203
Clear!

812
01:20:38,653 --> 01:20:40,424
Nothing!

813
01:20:41,528 --> 01:20:43,113
Putting back air!

814
01:20:46,353 --> 01:20:47,675
The trachea's fractured.

815
01:20:47,895 --> 01:20:50,803
- Pupils dialated.
- No response.

816
01:20:56,225 --> 01:20:57,487
Cain

817
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:01,681
Cain

818
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:41,508
I love you.

819
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:03,695
(Meg screams)
