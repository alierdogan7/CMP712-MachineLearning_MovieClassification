I love you so much.

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,268
- Mama?
- oh, god!

16
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,676
What are you
doing up, sweetie?

17
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,847
Did you have
another bad dream?

18
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,916
I dreamed
about a swing.

19
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,252
Is there one
at the new house?

20
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,388
Well, if there isn't,

21
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,623
I bet your daddy might
just put one up for you.

22
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,662
Come on, let's go
get some breakfast, okay?

23
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,564
- I'll meet you in there.
- Okay.

24
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,681
<i>What does our new house</i>
<i>look like?</i>

25
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,950
<i>It's way out</i>
<i>in the country</i>

26
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:41,220
<i>And there's just lots</i>
<i>of room for you to play.</i>

27
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,988
<i>Can we bring my bike?</i>

28
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,525
<i>Even though I don't know</i>
<i>how to ride it yet.</i>

29
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,261
<i>You are gonna have</i>
<i>lots of places</i>

30
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,862
<i>To learn</i>
<i>how to ride your bike.</i>

31
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,768
- Hey. Howdy.
- Daddy!

32
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,739
Oh! Mmm!

33
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,308
- You done good, daddy.
- Why, thank you.

34
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,477
What about you, huh?
What do you think?

35
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,280
- Who lived there before?
- Nobody, honey.

36
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,649
That's why the bank gave us
such a good deal, right?

37
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,385
- Thank you, mama.
- Mwah!

38
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,853
<i>Well, maybe you'd</i>
<i>rather live in there.</i>

39
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,623
- No.
- That can be arranged.

40
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,292
- No, thank you.
- You'd have the whole place
to yourself.

41
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,727
- Nope.
- Teddy bear could
have his own room.

42
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,428
Come on, let's go.
I'll race ya. Come on.

43
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,330
Go, go, go.
Race mama.

44
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,380
Oh, what
the hell, baby?

45
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,282
You can't find a clearer
station than that?

46
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,850
We're out
in the boondocks, babe.

47
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,785
We're lucky we get
running water. Thank you.

48
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,920
Well, we don't need water.
That's what beer is for.

49
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,423
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my beer,
by the way.

50
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,760
Mm-mmm.

51
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,548
Shoo! Git!

52
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,685
God! Shoo!

53
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,687
Shoo! Git!

54
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,559
<i>You think</i>
<i>that's funny, do you?</i>

55
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,621
Aunt joyce!

56
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,664
Aunt joyce!

57
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,633
Kid, you grow
like a weed.

58
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,470
Hi.

59
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,472
Look at you,
miss homeowner.

60
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,377
That didn't take long.

61
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,678
No suitcase?

62
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,614
I am not
a freeloader, andy.

63
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,783
- Today or historically?
- Stop it, andy.

64
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,918
Joyce is just here
to wish us well.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,587
Is that so?

66
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,059
It's a goddamn curse
being right all the time.

67
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,495
It truly is.

68
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,901
<i>It didn't work out</i>
<i>with ray.</i>

69
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,704
Was he the married one
or the drunk?

70
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,806
Bit of both,
it turns out.

71
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,474
What about you?

72
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,510
- Are you...?
- <i>11 weeks sober.</i>

73
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,078
- <i>heidi.</i>
<i>- Shit, call guinness.</i>

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,746
- <i>Help us. Help us.</i>
<i>- On second thought,</i>

75
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,449
<i>That's probably</i>
<i>a bad idea.</i>

76
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,986
<i>- I can get by.</i>
<i>- Heidi.</i>

77
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,889
<i>Heidi...</i>

78
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,757
<i>I've got alimony coming in.</i>

79
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,926
I want to be near family.

80
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,029
Well, find
a place near here.
Just not here.

81
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,900
Who lives over there?

82
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,802
That's just some old wreck
someone left behind.

83
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,870
- <i>I'm gonna haul it away.</i>
<i>- A girl lives down there.</i>

84
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,973
Hmm? Nobody lives
around here, baby.

85
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,843
- When'd you see a girl?
- Just now.

86
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,846
You know,
I've lived in worse.

87
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,117
"near here,
but not here," right?

88
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,985
You did
say that, babe.

89
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,893
Stop it.

90
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,240
<i>Mama?</i>

91
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,277
Why are you
crying?

92
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,746
It's nothing, sweetie.
It's nothing.

93
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,884
Aunt joyce is out front,
so go say good night.

94
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,687
And I'll come
tuck you in, okay?

95
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,589
Okay.

96
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,196
<i>Mama's crying.</i>

97
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,099
Do you know why
she gets sad?

98
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,205
Your mama...

99
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,341
Gets feelings
sometimes.

100
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,610
Feelings she doesn't
much care for.

101
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,212
What kind
of feelings?

102
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,349
Tell you what.
I want you to try
something for me.

103
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,117
Can you do that?

104
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,587
Look out there.

105
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,124
At what?

106
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,327
Don't really focus
on anything specific.

107
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,763
Just take it
all in.

108
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,776
Feel anything?

109
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,613
<i>Help us.</i>

110
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,682
- I think so.
- <i>Help us.</i>

111
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,218
And sometimes...

112
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,787
I see things.

113
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:29,227
That's 'cause you were born
with a veil, sweetie,

114
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,797
Just like your mama
and me and our mama.

115
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,833
What's a veil?

116
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,004
It means that
when you were born

117
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,973
You had a sheen over
your face like a wedding veil.

118
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,042
<i>And sometimes folks</i>
<i>born that way have a gift.</i>

119
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,911
They can--

120
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,015
They can sense certain things
that other people can't.

121
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,818
Mama never said
anything about it.

122
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,254
Your mama doesn't like
this kind of talk

123
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,390
Of gifts and feelings.

124
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:01,292
So let's just keep this
conversation between us, okay?

125
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,795
Now run
to bed, please.

126
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,832
Love you.

127
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,868
I love you, too.

128
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,133
<i>lisa...</i>

129
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,088
I know, mama.

130
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,258
Listen to me, lisa.

131
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,864
I have something
to tell you.

132
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,402
<i>Listen to me, lisa.</i>

133
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,138
<i>I have something</i>
<i>to tell you.</i>

134
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,907
Just be
a good girl...

135
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,313
<i>And listen</i>
<i>to your mother.</i>

136
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,316
Listen to me!

137
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,122
<i>Lisa.</i>

138
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,491
It's 6:00 a.M.

139
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,993
How long you been
in here this time, hmm?

140
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,865
You saw something again,
didn't you?

141
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,434
Here.

142
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,239
If these pills
ain't working,

143
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,441
We sure as hell shouldn't
keep paying for them.

144
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,011
They're working.

145
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,914
It just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, is all.

146
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,849
You should finish
getting dressed.

147
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,451
You'll be late
for work.

148
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,953
- All right, darling.
- Take care.

149
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,932
Careful, heidi.

150
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,268
- <i>You need any help?</i>
<i>- I can do it.</i>

151
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,104
Okay.

152
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,205
All right.

153
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,569
<i>Heidi.</i>

154
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,100
<i>♪ little girls,</i>
<i>they love to dream ♪</i>

155
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,571
<i>♪ close their eyes</i>

156
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,645
Hey, neighbor.

157
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,947
Heidi's been gone an hour
and I don't know where she is.

158
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,450
Well, she's probably
just wandering.

159
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,353
- Heidi is not a wanderer.
- That's 'cause she's never
had anywhere to wander to.

160
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,355
Now she does.
You're just gonna have
to get used to it.

161
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,224
Heidi. Baby.

162
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,159
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

163
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,394
I'm not
supposed to say.

164
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,597
Who said that?

165
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,000
Damn it, heidi,
who told you that?

166
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,534
Mr. Gordy.

167
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,342
- Who's mr. Gordy?
- An old man I met.

168
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,445
He said there's
a swing set in the woods
just like in my dream.

169
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,581
Remember, mama?

170
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,983
Okay. Okay.
Come here.

171
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,022
Joyce, get andy
on the phone.

172
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,260
This is it.

173
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,696
Mr. Gordy told me
there's a swing here.

174
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,365
Well, babe,
I don't see a swing.

175
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,635
I'll be damned.
There may not be
a swing here now,

176
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,337
But there used to be.

177
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,976
- jesus.
- Walk much?

178
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:48,212
Babe, did this mr. Gordy
say anything else to you?

179
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,316
He said there's money
buried in the garden.

180
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,352
Okay, sweetie, I want you
to do something for me.

181
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,054
How much money?

182
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,424
If this mr. Gordy ever
comes up to you again,

183
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,193
I want you to scream
as loud as you can.

184
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,362
Do you
understand me?

185
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:07,532
Okay.
Let's go.

186
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,169
Andy?

187
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,583
<i>I'm not supposed</i>
<i>to talk to you.</i>

188
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,786
<i>They think</i>
<i>you're a bad man.</i>

189
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,523
You're not, are you?

190
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,758
Heidi.

191
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,402
Was that mr. Gordy
you were talking to?

192
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,212
<i>Heidi, why didn't</i>
<i>you tell us</i>

193
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,615
<i>That you had</i>
<i>an imaginary friend?</i>

194
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,618
<i>- Mr. Gordy is not imaginary.</i>
<i>- He talks to me.</i>

195
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,286
<i>I was standing</i>
<i>right there watching.</i>

196
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,456
- There's nobody outside.
- Mr. Gordy's real.

197
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,591
Heidi, stop it.
I don't want to hear

198
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,226
Any more talk
about this mr. Gordy.

199
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,662
Do you understand?

200
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,231
Seeing things
that aren't there,

201
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,334
It's just not a road
that you want to go down.

202
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,905
Good night, okay?

203
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,548
You are
just saying that.

204
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,655
What the hell, joyce?
You've been here a week

205
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,557
And heidi's already
seeing invisible friends?

206
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,826
Turns out this mr. Gordy,
he's up here.

207
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,795
And you,
encouraging her.

208
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,665
Coming out here,
digging up my garden,
going on some wild-goose--

209
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,355
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

210
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,759
- <i>Let them in.</i>
<i>- Let them in.</i>

211
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,385
Good lord, woman.
What'd you do, rob
a shopping mall?

212
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,721
Courtesy of my new
sugar daddy mr. Gordy.

213
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,057
Did you tell heidi
where the money came from?

214
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,893
No, and neither
will you.

215
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,362
I'm sure there's lots of
stuff buried in these parts.

216
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,965
It doesn't mean
that there's a mr. Gordy.

217
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,834
I beg to differ.
Did you look at the deed
to your house?

218
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,637
- The previous owner?
- Yeah, the bank owned it.

219
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,774
Before that.
Check it out.

220
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,076
Straight from
the county assessor.

221
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,611
<i>Look at the name</i>
<i>on the bottom.</i>

222
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:56,080
The gordy family
owned all this land

223
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,948
Going back
200 years.

224
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,451
And this js gordy
was the last one.

225
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,386
Then the bank got it
in the '70s.

226
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,057
Ask me
how they got it.

227
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,962
Okay, you're gonna get
one shot at this, all right?

228
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,497
If this doesn't go the way
I think it's gonna go,

229
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,598
I'll never
bring it up again.

230
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,069
Deal.

231
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,738
Heidi, come out
here a second.

232
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,812
I am looking for
a husband for you.

233
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,949
They're all old.
You marry 'em.

234
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,852
Good girl. Okay,
pick a winner for me,

235
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,054
But look at them all
carefully first.
Can you do that?

236
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,003
You see
something, honey?

237
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,510
You know that man?

238
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,053
that's mr. Gordy.

239
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,088
<i>Okay.</i>

240
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,693
I told you
he was real.

241
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,561
I told you and you
didn't believe me.

242
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,481
Damn it!

243
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,858
My daughter is not
conversing with the dead.

244
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,728
She picked mr. Gordy's face
out of 50 pictures.
Explain that.

245
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,063
That's just
your influence
coming out in her.

246
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,434
You know what? I don't
want you talking about any
of this with heidi anymore.

247
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,802
You hear me?
She's my daughter.

248
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,136
She can talk
about it with me.

249
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:02,106
Why would she?
You don't listen.

250
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,675
You just tell her what's what
just like you did with me.

251
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,744
You needed it.
You know what?
You still do.

252
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:08,145
I suppose I'd be better off
numbing myself with pills?

253
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,648
- Stop it.
- You don't think I know?

254
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,451
That was
mama's trick, too.

255
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,586
And that worked out
beautifully for her.

256
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:17,488
Joyce, go home.

257
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,558
There is nothing wrong
with heidi.

258
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,963
You know
what it is, lisa.

259
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,101
It's starting
for her.

260
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,617
<i>Honey?</i>

261
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,520
Are you awake?

262
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,881
<i>When I hear of a family</i>
<i>moving to town,</i>

263
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,949
<i>I visit to see</i>
<i>if they found the church yet.</i>

264
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,684
Because I happen
to preside over one.

265
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,586
Oh.

266
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,255
<i>Folks around here</i>
<i>have been wondering</i>

267
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,257
When this rather special
piece of property would sell.

268
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,627
Yeah?
What's special about it?

269
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,996
Aside from it being
overgrown as all hell.

270
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,832
- Andy wyrick.
- Pastor jordan wells.

271
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,834
<i>The property</i>
<i>is special</i>

272
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,136
Because back around
the time of the civil war,

273
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,306
It was
the stationmaster's land.
But I'm sure you knew that.

274
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,242
What, like a railroad?
No tracks on this land.

275
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,978
No, it wasn't
that kind of railroad.

276
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,881
Do you mean, like,
the underground railroad?

277
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,051
Folks who helped escaped
slaves make it up north?

278
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,288
That's right.
Those people were known
as "stationmasters."

279
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,292
And one of the
most well-known lived
right here on your land.

280
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,561
He actually hid slaves
on our property?

281
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,630
Yes, ma'am.
Hundreds of men,
women, and children

282
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,767
Passed right through here
with nothing but the clothes
on their back

283
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,635
<i>And the light of the moon</i>
<i>to guide them.</i>

284
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,672
- They didn't have flashlights?
- Oh, no, sweetie.

285
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,807
<i>They couldn't even</i>
<i>use lanterns.</i>

286
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,277
The moonlight was the only
light that they ever saw.

287
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,179
<i>It was the light</i>
<i>of freedom</i>

288
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,348
And the promised land.

289
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,052
The stationmaster was
an extraordinary man.

290
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:31,055
Entire generations
of families would not exist

291
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,957
If it was not
for the stationmaster

292
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,092
And this piece of land.

293
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,595
So, don't be surprised

294
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,263
If you get visitors
from time to time.

295
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,199
- Living ones, I hope.
- As opposed to...?

296
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,335
Andy's just having
a little fun.

297
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:47,871
- I do that.
- Well, if you do
get any visitors,

298
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,940
I hope you'll be
more welcoming

299
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,843
<i>Than the previous owner</i>
<i>js gordy was.</i>

300
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,212
<i>He didn't exactly share</i>
<i>his ancestor's...</i>

301
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,114
Hospitable nature.

302
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,950
Between you and me,

303
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,920
There was something
seriously off about that man.

304
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,188
Mr. Gordy's
nice to me.

305
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,023
Uh, look, pastor...

306
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,625
Sweetie...

307
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,893
We'd better get
our day started.

308
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,873
Hello?

309
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,366
<i>Help us. Help us.</i>

310
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,302
<i>Help us.</i>

311
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,906
<i>Help us.</i>
<i>Help us.</i>

312
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,359
Mr. Gordy.

313
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:37,661
<i>What is that?</i>

314
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,430
Tell me
what it is.

315
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,302
- Heidi.
- Mr. Gordy.

316
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,104
Heidi!

317
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,540
You know what?

318
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,277
I think there is an invisible
man around here.

319
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,446
It's me.

320
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,651
- Did you miss your daddy?
- Yeah.

321
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,653
Yeah?
Right answer.

322
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,289
- Got a little
surprise for you.
- What is it?

323
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,590
You'll find out.
Come on.

324
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,594
Look what I found
in the back of
your daddy's truck.

325
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,930
heidi, meet chief.

326
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:16,934
Oh, my god!
Daddy, I love him!

327
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,602
Am I the greatest father
in the world or what?

328
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,703
- You'll do.
- Thank you.

329
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,705
Oh, I love you.

330
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,336
Remember to bring
chief's bowl back in
the house after he's done.

331
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,404
Where's chief?

332
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,506
For god's sake.

333
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,642
- Chief!
- Chief!

334
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,978
Chief!

335
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,015
Damn dog.

336
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,722
Come on.

337
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,490
It's gonna be
all right.

338
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,097
<i>Chief!</i>

339
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,004
Chief sounds hurt.

340
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,374
Hey, heidi, why don't you
just sit down right here
for a second?

341
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,110
Okay?
And don't move.

342
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,415
Be right back.

343
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,384
<i>Chief!</i>

344
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,624
Hey.
Come here, boy.

345
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,160
Chief.

346
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,099
Chief.

347
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,267
<i>How'd you get</i>
<i>in there, boy?</i>

348
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:01,638
Daddy.

349
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,080
<i>Heidi.</i>

350
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,253
All right,
watch out, boy.

351
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,533
<i>What the hell?</i>

352
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,601
Daddy?

353
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,679
<i>help us... Help us.</i>

354
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,617
<i>Heidi.</i>

355
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,622
<i>Heidi!</i>

356
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,236
<i>Help us.</i>

357
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,146
no. Damn it. Hey.

358
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,481
I thought I told you
to sit tight.

359
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,817
what are you hollering
about over here?

360
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,761
<i>Come on.</i>

361
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,663
Let's get you home.

362
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,574
Hey, babe.

363
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,376
Figure out what
this thing is yet?

364
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,545
Yeah.

365
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,413
It's a trap.

366
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,349
You see, you bait
that chamber there.

367
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,352
The animals, they get in
and they can't get back out.

368
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,355
They get weak and starve.
Easy pickings.

369
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,657
Hmm.

370
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,193
Then you get 'em
back out through here.

371
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,861
A back door.

372
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,729
There's got to be
a better way to hunt.

373
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,865
- That's just cruel.
- <i>No, it's smart.</i>

374
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,234
If you're
a taxidermist.

375
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,570
<i>I already found</i>
<i>three more of them</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

376
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,372
Figure they made good money
for someone back in...

377
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,276
Well, whenever the hell
they still used locks
like these.

378
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:56,580
Well, smash 'em all up
so chief doesn't get
stuck in them again.

379
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,582
Or heidi,
for that matter.

380
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,285
I love you, lisa.
Don't be afraid.

381
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,355
Let them in.

382
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,323
- <i>Let them in.</i>

383
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,870
Oh.

384
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,773
Hey.

385
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,042
What's going on, huh?

386
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,677
Oh, god.

387
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,968
I have a bike.
Do you?

388
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,571
Oh, it's pretty.

389
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:31,374
It's purpley.

390
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,411
What do you mean?

391
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,646
Really?
People are coming?

392
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,982
What kind of people?

393
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,750
Who are you
talking to now?

394
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,719
Mr. Gordy.

395
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,487
That right?

396
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,023
Ask him where
there's more money.

397
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:49,626
I can't.
He's gone.

398
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,595
Next time, then.

399
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,864
He said there's
people coming.

400
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,433
Who?

401
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,871
I swear, heidi,
we should take you
and mr. Gordy on the road.

402
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,741
Who's there?

403
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,976
Stay behind me.

404
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,549
I got an ax.

405
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,459
Hello?

406
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,477
What the hell
is this place?

407
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:06,436
- Do you see her, too?
- Yeah.

408
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,675
Mama kay?

409
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,644
Whoa, whoa.

410
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,013
It's okay.
My name is prentiss.

411
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,416
<i>This is my grandmother</i>
<i>mama kay.</i>

412
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,584
- <i>This your property?</i>
<i>- That you're trespassing on?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

413
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,486
We were told
we could come back here.

414
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,721
Bullshit.
By who?

415
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,856
Woman
in the trailer.

416
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,758
Said she's your sister.
Sold us this.

417
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,796
Sister-in-law.
What is that?

418
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:35,131
Shoofly.

419
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,700
<i>Prentiss?</i>

420
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,537
Now help me
sit on down.

421
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,939
I want to visit
with the little one.

422
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,575
<i>Come on, little one.</i>

423
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,477
It'll be all right,
young man.

424
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,115
All right, you gonna tell me
why you came all the way

425
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,050
Out here just to buy
some ratty old quilt?

426
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,454
Long time ago,
when this quilt was hung
out here in these woods,

427
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,923
It meant it was safe
to approach.

428
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,025
Safe for who?

429
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,860
Mama kay's ancestors,
for one.

430
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,562
Mine, too.

431
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,831
Do you even know
where you're living
at, mister...?

432
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,165
Andy.

433
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:13,102
Our pastor said
we might get visitors.

434
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,737
Something about
the underground railroad.

435
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,573
This was one
of the stations.

436
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:22,111
<i>Mama kay's always wanted</i>
<i>to visit this place.</i>

437
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,813
Guy saved a lot of lives,
I reckon.

438
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,149
And he deserved better
than what happened to him.

439
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:30,920
You don't need eyes
to see, little one.

440
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,789
But you already
know that.

441
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,491
What do you mean?

442
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:39,229
You asked your father
if he saw me.

443
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:42,599
That makes you
some kind of special.

444
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,101
My mama says I'm not
supposed to talk about that.

445
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,270
But you
have to be careful

446
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,205
With a gift
like that.

447
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,107
'cause sometimes

448
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:54,711
The devil looks
a gentleman.

449
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,049
You're telling me...

450
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,620
All that took place
on my property?

451
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,021
Yes, sir.

452
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,691
Right here.

453
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,927
Guess your pastor
left that part out.

454
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,029
Yeah.

455
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,637
Family meeting.

456
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,139
Whoa, whoa.

457
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,074
Not you, kiddo.

458
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,976
You stay outside
for a minute, all right?

459
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,845
Okay, daddy.

460
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,881
Sit down, joyce.

461
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,989
<i>That man told daddy what</i>
<i>happened here, didn't he?</i>

462
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:41,925
<i>Why can't I know?</i>

463
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,560
<i>It's just not a story</i>
<i>for little girls, sweetie.</i>

464
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,295
I'm a big girl.
You always say that.

465
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,600
You remember
pastor wells talking
about the stationmaster?

466
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,137
<i>Well, back when he</i>
<i>owned all this land,</i>

467
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,707
<i>He was what's called</i>
<i>a taxidermist.</i>

468
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:01,277
<i>He also did something that</i>
<i>he didn't tell anybody.</i>

469
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,913
He would help
hide people

470
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,848
That were
in trouble.

471
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:10,119
<i>People like mama kay's</i>
<i>great aunt nell</i>

472
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,789
<i>And her fiancé levi.</i>

473
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,224
<i>See, nell and levi</i>
<i>had fallen in love</i>

474
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:19,596
And had dreams
of getting married once
they were safe and free.

475
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,333
How the hell did people
even find their way out here?

476
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:25,668
There were guides
called conductors

477
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,271
Who helped them.
And these quilts,

478
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,974
They were a code from
the stationmaster telling
them where'd he meet them.

479
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:33,276
- Look here.
You see this tree?
- Yeah.

480
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,947
<i>There it is down there.</i>
<i>The meeting place.</i>

481
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,049
The stationmaster
would come get them

482
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,051
And take them
to a hiding place,

483
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,353
Somewhere
on this property,

484
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:46,389
Until it was safe
to move on.

485
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,325
Well, some of
the other landowners,

486
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:53,630
They found out
what the stationmaster
had been doing

487
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:56,366
<i>And, well, they didn't</i>
<i>like it very much.</i>

488
00:43:56,368 --> 00:44:00,903
<i>So they did some</i>
<i>very unkind things to him.</i>

489
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:15,385
They hurt him
just for helping people?

490
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:16,953
Well, they didn't see it
that way, sweetie.

491
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:20,390
What happened to nell?
She make it up north?

492
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:23,226
Nell and levi
never arrived.

493
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,061
No one knows
what happened to them.

494
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,864
<i>I told you something bad</i>
<i>happened here.</i>

495
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:29,699
<i>No, it was</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

496
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,268
All of that evil
is over and done with now.

497
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,737
It's still here, mama.
I can feel it.

498
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,073
It's in the woods.
It's coming for me.

499
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,808
No, it's not.

500
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,679
Heidi, it's all
in your head.

501
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,214
- It's not real.
- But mr. Gordy said--

502
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:48,818
There is
no mr. Gordy.

503
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,319
Heidi, listen to me.

504
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:52,321
You have to fight this.

505
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,024
You have to put it
out of your head or--

506
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,693
I'll be like you?

507
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,337
Dry off.

508
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,473
If you loved me,
you'd believe me.

509
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:13,242
It's because I love you
that I can't, baby.

510
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,920
I don't hear you
getting out of that tub.

511
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:30,126
Heidi wyrick,
don't make me
come back in there.

512
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,000
Heidi, what is
taking so long?

513
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,243
Heidi?

514
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,892
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

515
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:04,994
Oh, god!

516
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:07,797
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

517
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:11,134
Come on, baby.
Cough it up.

518
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,977
Honey!

519
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,991
Lisa.

520
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,492
Heidi.

521
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,094
Andy.

522
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:40,229
What happened?

523
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:44,801
She was convulsing
and unconscious.

524
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:48,004
And vomiting sawdust
and insects?

525
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,942
- <i>Andy.</i>
<i>- Are you on any medication,</i>
<i>mrs. Wyrick?</i>

526
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,811
You didn't see what I saw.
I saw her.

527
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:57,313
- <i>You weren't there.</i>
<i>- Heidi.</i>

528
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,448
Do you remember
any of this?

529
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,917
Yeah, baby.

530
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,052
I didn't dry off
like I was supposed to.

531
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:06,923
And mama pulled me out
of the tub real hard.

532
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,291
I'm sorry,
that's not what happened.

533
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:11,360
They've been through
enough for tonight.

534
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,030
Come on.

535
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:22,004
Just tell me exactly what
we're supposed to do here.

536
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,374
If you want my advice,
I suggest you consult
with a psychiatrist.

537
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:28,110
Or a priest.

538
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:30,179
Thanks.

539
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,915
- Andy.
- Let's let heidi
rest up a sec.

540
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,157
It's hard when people
don't believe you,

541
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,259
Isn't it?

542
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,634
Really, lisa?
We're possessed
by the devil now?

543
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:54,570
Good lord, people.
It's a blessing,
not an exorcism.

544
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:56,339
Please.

545
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,309
Hi.

546
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:03,379
Lord, we pray this night

547
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,448
For the soul
of an innocent child,

548
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,484
And the banishment
of evil from this land.

549
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:10,419
<i>I want you to pray</i>
<i>with me now.</i>

550
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,055
<i>Can you do that?</i>

551
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,364
In the name
of the father,

552
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:24,500
I ask for the cleansing
of fear and sickness

553
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,436
From the mind and
the soul of this child.

554
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,906
I ask that
you fill heidi

555
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,241
With the warmth
of your love into
her heart.

556
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,578
<i>And that you call</i>
<i>upon your angels</i>
<i>to watch over her</i>

557
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,180
<i>And protect her</i>
<i>from danger.</i>

558
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:41,117
Mom and dad, would you
lean down and lay her
back for me, please?

559
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,926
<i>In the name</i>
<i>of the son,</i>

560
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:52,194
We call upon your
righteous hand,

561
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:56,032
Rid this place
of all evil

562
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,199
That may dwell here.

563
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,294
<i>Help us.</i>

564
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,214
<i>I ask that you</i>
<i>bless this child</i>

565
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,450
In the name
of the holy ghost.

566
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,554
She and the souls
of the lost,

567
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,256
The forsaken
and forgotten.

568
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:58,627
And let your cleansing light
shine down upon this place

569
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:02,331
And upon this little girl
now and forever.

570
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,034
- <i>Amen.</i>

571
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,471
Amen.

572
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:17,079
Amen.

573
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,419
Amen.

574
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:26,756
May god's love
fill your heart, child,

575
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:30,426
<i>And give you peace</i>
<i>all of your days.</i>

576
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:33,562
Now, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

577
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,299
You did great.

578
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,660
Mama?

579
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,248
Pastor
sent you away.

580
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,724
<i>Lisa!</i>

581
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,612
<i>Lisa?</i>

582
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,549
- Andy?
- Heidi's gone.

583
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,751
- What?
- Call the cops.

584
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,054
Oh, my...

585
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,527
Heidi!

586
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,031
Heidi!

587
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,910
Heidi!

588
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,548
Heidi!

589
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,950
Heidi!

590
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,019
<i>Daddy!</i>

591
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,954
<i>Help me!</i>

592
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,024
Heidi!

593
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,497
<i>Daddy!</i>

594
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,835
- Any sign of her yet?
- No.

595
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,071
<i>Heidi!</i>

596
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,006
Heidi.

597
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:19,775
<i>Daddy!</i>

598
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:21,744
- Heidi!
- <i>Help me!</i>

599
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:24,980
- Where are you, baby?
- <i>Down in the hole.</i>

600
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,585
What hole?

601
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:31,687
<i>Down here!</i>

602
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,695
<i>Daddy!</i>

603
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,163
Oh, my god.

604
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,075
Oh, heidi.

605
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:56,044
I can't get out, daddy.
I can't get out.

606
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,414
Sit tight, heidi.

607
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,648
<i>I got to find a way</i>
<i>to get down there, baby.</i>

608
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,983
No.

609
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,889
<i>heidi.</i>

610
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:09,958
<i>- </i> <i>heidi.</i>

611
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:14,830
Please!

612
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:16,732
<i>Please!</i>

613
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,702
Shit!

614
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,505
Please don't leave me
down here with them, daddy.

615
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,708
With who, heidi?

616
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,485
<i>Heidi!</i>

617
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,531
Mr. Gordy,
is that you?

618
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,509
Daddy, help me!

619
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,578
I'm coming.

620
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,247
Daddy!

621
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:07,249
Heidi!

622
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:09,718
Daddy!

623
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,557
<i>daddy.</i>

624
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,995
<i>heidi.</i>

625
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,033
<i>Heidi.</i>

626
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:37,646
I'm gonna die.

627
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,190
Help me!

628
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,305
<i>Heidi!</i>

629
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:05,941
- Daddy, hurry.
- Heidi, heads up.
Coming down.

630
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:08,810
Daddy, hurry!

631
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:11,013
- Help!
- Watch out.

632
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,082
Daddy!

633
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,285
I'm coming, baby.

634
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,961
Heidi.

635
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,685
Heidi.

636
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:55,057
daddy!

637
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,992
Heidi.
Oh, jesus.

638
00:59:56,994 --> 01:00:00,128
How the hell did you
get down here, baby, huh?

639
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,800
What the hell?

640
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:07,636
This is where
the stationmaster hid 'em.

641
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,107
Unbelievable.

642
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,910
How the hell did you
find this place, heidi, huh?

643
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,145
A girl showed me.

644
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,914
Is that the one that you said
was down here with you?

645
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,048
No.

646
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,629
I think something else
is down here, too, daddy.

647
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:36,031
I don't want
to be here anymore.

648
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,834
That makes two of us.

649
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,906
<i>Know the story</i>
<i>of the stationmaster</i>
<i>who helped slaves escape</i>

650
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,908
<i>To freedom as part of</i>
<i>the underground railroad.</i>

651
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,944
<i>But last night,</i>
<i>a young local girl</i>

652
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,679
<i>Uncovered a sad, unknown</i>
<i>chapter in the saga</i>

653
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:55,217
<i>What authorities</i>
<i>believe are the remains</i>
<i>of five males...</i>

654
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,985
<i>...Discovered in a hidden</i>
<i>underground chamber</i>

655
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,287
<i>Beneath the ruins</i>
<i>of the stationmaster's cabin.</i>

656
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:02,324
<i>Now, the stationmaster,</i>
<i>also known as jefferson gordy,</i>

657
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:06,962
<i>Was the great grandfather</i>
<i>of the late js gordy</i>
<i>who died in 1978...</i>

658
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,264
<i>For all the lives</i>
<i>that were saved by the</i>
<i>underground railroad,</i>

659
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:11,166
<i>There were also many folks</i>
<i>who didn't make it.</i>

660
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,135
<i>Just went missing.</i>

661
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,303
<i>And today's discovery</i>
<i>is a tragic reminder</i>

662
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:16,972
<i>Of how dangerous</i>
<i>it really was.</i>

663
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,740
<i>In this</i>
<i>particular case,</i>

664
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:20,208
<i>When the stationmaster</i>
<i>was murdered,</i>

665
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,744
<i>There was no one to let</i>
<i>the slaves out...</i>

666
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,847
- Can we please turn it off?
- <i>They probably starved</i>
<i>to death down there.</i>

667
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,382
- <i>Reporting live--</i>

668
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:29,818
You think that's
mama kay's family?

669
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,854
They said five males,
so I doubt it.

670
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,426
Hey. What are you
doing up?

671
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,730
I don't want to
live here anymore.

672
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,999
<i>It's all right</i>
<i>now, heidi.</i>

673
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:47,969
The things that we saw,
they've moved on.

674
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,005
Their spirits
aren't trapped anymore
because of you.

675
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:52,841
Joyce, please.
Spirits?

676
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:55,010
Don't you understand
what's happened here, lisa?

677
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,812
Those people in the chamber
wanted to be found.

678
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,213
That's what this
has all been about.

679
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,916
<i>Now they're free.</i>

680
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:04,319
And there is nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

681
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,455
Mr. Gordy says
it's not safe here.

682
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,991
You see
mr. Gordy tonight?

683
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,794
He said I shouldn't have
gone down in that hole.

684
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:14,463
<i>He said I let</i>
<i>something bad come out.</i>

685
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:17,332
Okay, it is time for you
to go back to bed.

686
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,404
Heidi wyrick,
you follow me right now.

687
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,973
I can't be here
anymore, mama.

688
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,476
<i>I went in the hole</i>
<i>and the bad man saw me.</i>

689
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:30,479
He knows we're here now
and he's coming.

690
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,280
What bad man,
sweetie?

691
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,216
The stationmaster.

692
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:36,084
<i>I let him out, mama.</i>

693
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,987
Well, mr. Gordy is wrong
because you know very well

694
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,455
That the stationmaster
was a good man.

695
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,791
No, he wasn't.

696
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:45,827
Andy, will you please
tell her that there is
nothing to be afraid of?

697
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:50,031
Mr. Gordy said there was money
buried in the garden, lisa,

698
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,399
And there was.

699
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,902
He said that

700
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:56,071
Something terrible
happened here, it did.

701
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:58,974
For something
in heidi's mind,

702
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:00,475
Mr. Gordy is sure
as hell right a lot.

703
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:02,344
Are you telling me that
suddenly you believe all this?

704
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:04,412
<i>I believe there was a cave</i>
<i>full of skeletons on our land.</i>

705
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:06,815
Lisa,

706
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:10,051
Was there a bad man
down there, too?

707
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,987
Hell if I know,

708
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:14,156
But I say
we pack up the truck
and we haul our asses

709
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,957
Out of here
before we find out.

710
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,529
Heidi.

711
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,911
Andy.

712
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:12,547
I mean,
you can't be serious.

713
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:15,550
We don't have
anywhere to go.

714
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,853
I mean, where--
where are we gonna go?

715
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,889
Baby, I--

716
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:23,191
I'm sick.

717
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,228
- Heidi and I--
- you're fine.

718
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:29,331
Heidi's fine.

719
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,366
Tell me something.

720
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,136
How the hell did heidi
get down in that hole?

721
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:37,539
Even if she could move
that slab, which she can't,

722
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,609
It's a 25-foot drop
after that.

723
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:42,043
She didn't have
a scratch on her.

724
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,980
Did you ever think
that maybe joyce is right?

725
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:47,015
Crazy joyce.

726
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:49,184
That this isn't some kind
of disease, but,

727
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:53,288
I don't know,
it's... A gift?

728
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,957
A gift?

729
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:58,560
You try seeing what I've seen
and you call it a gift.

730
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:00,195
I'm just saying
maybe it is.

731
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,964
<i>And I'm done letting you</i>
<i>tell our daughter</i>

732
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:04,966
<i>That she's sick.</i>

733
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:07,035
That she's got
some mental disorder.

734
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:09,137
- I--
- I love you. I do.

735
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,673
But...

736
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:14,242
I won't...

737
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:18,079
Let heidi live like this.
You understand me?

738
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,082
- I won't do it.
- Andy, please.

739
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:25,287
Look, I have seen enough
to know that it ain't up here.

740
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:28,390
It's out there.

741
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,926
And maybe it's trying
to tell us something.

742
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,429
Maybe you should
try listening.

743
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,373
It's sure gonna be lonely
here without you guys.

744
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:48,510
You should leave, too.
This is a bad place.

745
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:51,146
No, sweetie,
it was a bad place.

746
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:54,249
Now it's not
'cause of you.

747
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,484
I'm gonna miss you,
baby girl.

748
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,120
I'm gonna
miss you, too.

749
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,503
Hey, chief.
Come on, buddy.

750
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,239
Hop up.
Aw, good boy.

751
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,541
<i>Good boy.</i>

752
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,052
hey.

753
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:06,421
<i>Chief.</i>
<i>Chief!</i>

754
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:14,262
Chief.
Hey!

755
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,498
Where the hell is that
damn dog going?

756
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,467
Daddy, we need to leave
right now.

757
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,770
Without your mama?
Yeah, I'm not sure
how she'd take that.

758
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:24,172
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>Let me go find chief.</i>

759
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,274
Be right back.
Stay here and lock the door.

760
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:28,109
<i>Chief!</i>

761
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:29,077
<i>Chief!</i>

762
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,629
<i>Chief!</i>

763
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,664
<i>Here, boy.</i>

764
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:56,838
<i>Heidi.</i>

765
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,588
Lisa?

766
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,124
<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Easy pickings.</i>

Are you in here?

842
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:37,985
You remember pastor wells
talking about the stationmaster?

843
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:46,060
<i>Well, back when he owned</i>
<i>all this land,</i>

844
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:49,096
<i>He was also what's called</i>

Okay.
Okay, careful.
