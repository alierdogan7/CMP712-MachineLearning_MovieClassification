179

180
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,901
Close.
El Sereno.

181

183
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,158
Vibrant, blue-collar,
diverse.

184
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:49,364
I'd gentrify the shit
out of El Sereno.

She's gonna be okay.

529
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:29,641
We made it.

530
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,404
I love you, Christopher.

I must stay in constant motion.

535
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,032
What do we do?
Can we stay here?

536
00:42:31,405 --> 00:42:33,121
No.

537
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:36,575
No, you cannot.

538
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:39,961

541
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,291
Not here.

542
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:06,988
So why are we here?

543
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:11,159
Why'd we come here
if we're not staying?

The only way
to survive a mad world

548
00:43:21,622 --> 00:43:23,872
is to embrace the madness.

549
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:30,712
Is that a yes?

Liza.

552
00:44:14,641 --> 00:44:17,008
Liza.
What's wrong?

00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:34,776
Oh, God.

554
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,115
Yeah.

What do we--
what do we do?

557
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,874
There's nothing.

558
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:57,465
No. No.

I have to, but I
don't think I can.

562
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:12,948
No, don't ask me, Liza.
You can't.

563
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,199
You asked me.

564
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:16,318
Come on.

565
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,286
You never liked me that much.

566
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:22,574
Don't make Travis do it.

567
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:24,125
It'll break him.

568
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:29,631
- We don't know--
- I know.

569
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:50,735
What's going on?
Maddy.

570
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:57,859
Maddy?

571
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:00,745
She was bitten.

572
00:46:00,747 --> 00:46:02,914
What?

573
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:04,532
She's infected.

574
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:11,589
That's-- that's okay.

575
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:13,541
That's okay.
We have meds now.

576
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:15,710
- No. - Yeah, you got the antibiotics
from the base, right?

577
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:17,712
- They don't work.
- We can treat you.

578
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:20,682
- We could treat it.
- You can't.

579
00:46:20,684 --> 00:46:22,517
Please, Travis.

580
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,105
- Tell Chris I did it.
- No, God damn it.

581
00:46:27,107 --> 00:46:29,307
I'm not gonna-- you're not doing it.
You're not doing anything.

582
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,643
I'm not gonna let you do it, Liza.
Listen.

583
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:33,561
I've seen it.

584
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:36,147
I've seen what it does.

585
00:46:36,149 --> 00:46:40,035
The bites don't turn you, but
the infection's not treatable.

586
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:45,623
The infection kills you
like anything else.

587
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:47,492
Then it happens.

588
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,246
It doesn't matter how you die,

589
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,548
you come back.

590
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,800
We all come back.

591
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:59,387
Don't let that happen to me.

592
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,591
Don't let our son
see that, okay?

593
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:07,812
You've got to
protect him from this.

594
00:47:07,814 --> 00:47:10,065
Okay?
Promise me.

595
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:13,184
Promise.

596
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:20,575
Okay?

597
00:47:21,578 --> 00:47:23,495
I'll protect him.

598
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:25,163
I'll protect him.
