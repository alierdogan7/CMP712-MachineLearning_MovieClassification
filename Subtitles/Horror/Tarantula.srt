1
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,593
- What's the score, Doc?
- Twins. Cutest things you ever saw.

2
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,477
Hey, they're keeping you busy these days.

3
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,790
It's the desert.
Gives people wonderful ideas.

4
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,836
- Check the ship, will you?
- You betcha.

5
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,192
Hiya, Doc.
Phone's been ringing like crazy for you.

6
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,918
Sheriff's half out of his mind.

7
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,036
- Call him for me, will you, Josh?
- Yeah.

8
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,470
- I'm ringing him, Doc.
- That's fine.

9
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,713
- He's on, Doc.
- Thanks, Josh.

10
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,679
Hello, Jack. What's up?

11
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,234
Can you come over right away, Doc?

12
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,998
I hate to bother you.

13
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,800
I know you've been up all night,
but this is important.

14
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,589
Okay.

15
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,038
Doc, sure sounded worried, didn't he?

16
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,317
Someday, you old codger, you're going
to hear something you won't like.

17
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,914
Are you inferring that I was listening in?

18
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,515
Yeah.

19
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,878
Hi, Jack. What's all the excitement about?
Who's sick?

20
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,552
- Nobody.
- Huh?

21
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,108
The boys found a man near the highway
this morning.

22
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,673
- Run over?
- No.

23
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,315
- Well, then?
- That's why I called you, Doc.

24
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,278
- What's it look like?
- Like nothing I've ever seen before.

25
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,429
Who is it?

26
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,911
Well, he has the same general build
as Eric Jacobs, but I'm not sure.

27
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,475
I don't follow you.

28
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,028
There's something about his face
says he's Jacobs...

29
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,828
but maybe he ain't.

30
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,199
Look, Jack, I'm lost.

31
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,198
You remember Jacobs, don't you?

32
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,953
Yeah, he's the biologist.
Works for Prof. Deemer.

33
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,473
Met him a couple of years ago.

34
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,518
He's over at the undertaker's.
You'd better have a look.

35
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,559
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

36
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,437
I phoned Deemer right away.

37
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,715
He said he'd be over to see if this is him.

38
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,199
You know Deemer, don't you?

39
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,431
Yeah. When I opened my office
I went out to pay my respects.

40
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,839
He was polite enough...

41
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,480
but I had the feeling I wasn't welcome,
so I never went back.

42
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,199
Some of these big brains
never learnt manners.

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,793
Here he is, Barney.

44
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,279
- Hi, Doc.
- Hello, Barney.

45
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,555
You figure this one out and you're good.

46
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,835
Now you know why I'm not sure.

47
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,756
That's not Jacobs.
This man has had the disease for years.

48
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,988
I saw Jacobs last month.
He looked okay then.

49
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,991
BARNEY: They're in the back room,
Professor.

50
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,514
It's Eric, all right.

51
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,555
He was my friend for 30 years.

52
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,917
SHERIFF: You better come outside,
Professor.

53
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,109
Yes.

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,319
- You all through in there?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,356
Leave us alone for a minute,
will you, Barney?

56
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,873
Yeah, sure.

57
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,313
Professor, I have to know all about it.

58
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,593
Why he looks that way, why he was missing.

59
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,999
Sheriff, have you ever watched...

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,958
a friend dying before your eyes
and not been able to help?

61
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,119
That's the worst of it.

62
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,874
Being helpless.

63
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,035
It's particularly tough
when you're a physician...

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,678
and you know what's wrong with him.

65
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,150
And there isn't a single solitary thing you
or anyone else can do.

66
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,238
When I saw the body,
I though it was acromegalia.

67
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,594
But that's not possible.

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,033
Acromegalia?

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,830
The pituitary gland goes haywire, Jack.

70
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,354
It distorts the face, neck, hands, and feet.

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,668
I met Jacobs a couple of years ago
at your place.

72
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,396
The sheriff saw him about a month ago.
He looked normal then.

73
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,752
It is acromegalia.

74
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,988
But in every case I've ever heard of...

75
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,150
it's taken years to produce the deformity.

76
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,354
I know.

77
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,911
The history of medicine
is the history of the unusual.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,758
Perhaps Eric had been ill for years.
Who knows?

79
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,515
But it was only four days ago that
he began to complain of muscular pains.

80
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,353
Neither of us thought too much about it.

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,239
These things happen as you grow older.

82
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,993
And the next morning he began to...

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,879
To change.

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,513
Maybe we'd better do an autopsy
just to make sure.

85
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,272
I don't think that'll be necessary.

86
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,669
I was in attendance,
and I signed the death certificate.

87
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,749
I see.

88
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,957
How come we found him on the desert?

89
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,508
Dr. Jacobs became delirious last night.

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,397
Broke out of the house
and ran into the desert.

91
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,950
Are you certain he hadn't complained
of anything before that time?

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,554
There's nothing I can add
to what I've already said.

93
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,999
Eric had no family.
I'll arrange for the funeral.

94
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,871
Thank you for calling me so promptly.

95
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,996
- Goodbye, Dr. Hastings.
- Professor.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,115
Acromegalia.

97
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,077
- You heard the man.
- I sure did.

98
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,470
A young fellow like you can't stack
what he knows against the professor.

99
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,755
The trouble is, Doc,
you hate to admit you're wrong.

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,752
We all make mistakes, Jack.
This isn't one of mine.

[Pigs squealing]

102
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,188
Hello.

103
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,709
There we go.

104

[Monkey squealing]

105
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,480
- Paul!
- Eric is dead. Do you hear me?

106
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,997
PAUL: There's just you and me...

107
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,149
and we're going to die, too.

108
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,990
DEEMER: No, Paul! Keep away from me!

109
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,277
I'm trying to help you. Paul!

[Monkey screeching]

112
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,116
Coco, you startled me.

113
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,957
So you escaped the fire?

114
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,197
Let me see those paws.

115
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,392
I'll have to do something about those burns,
won't I?

116
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,674
Come on, Coco.

117
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,115
You've got that look
like you swallowed the canary.

118
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,315
Not at all.

119
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,594
If there's anything a man hates...

120
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,478
it's to be told he's wrong
when he knows he's right.

121
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,994
I knew Deemer had burnt your tail.

122
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,953
Listen, I'm just a country doctor,
but I know what I know.

123
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,830
And I know acromegalia doesn't turn up
in four days out of left field.

124
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,955
So?

125
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,077
So I went to the medical library in Phoenix
and read up on it.

126
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,999
There wasn't one single recorded case
in medical history...

127
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,152
where a malformation developed as fast
as Deemer said Jacobs' did.

128
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,038
- You mean he was lying to us?
- I don't know.

129
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,997
But I'd like to know why
he was in such a hurry to bury Jacobs...

130
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,150
and why he didn't want me to do
an autopsy.

131
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,870
The man's an M.D. Like you.
He's entitled to his opinion.

132
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,192
Or do you want me to charge him
with confusing a country doctor?

133
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,758
There's nothing like the safety of prestige,
is there, Sheriff?

134
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,034
Let's skip it.

135
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,439
Everything's clean and legal...

136
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,080
and I wouldn't want you
to stick your neck out for anything.

137
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,388
What do you want me to do?

138
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,994
Pinch him because I don't like the way
he parts his hair?

139
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,150
Have you ever asked yourself
what Deemer and Jacobs...

140
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,514
were working on in their lab?

141
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,996
No, and I don't intend to jimmy open
a window to find out, either.

142
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,554
Deemer's speciality is nutrient biology.

143
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,551
Jacobs is a leader in the same field.

144
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,075
Now when two big shots like that
get together...

145
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,958
and hole up in the desert,
20 miles from civilization...

146
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,031
I'd say they might
be working on something...

147
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,554
they're not too anxious to talk about.

148
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,956
You think whatever they might be doing
ties in with what killed Jacobs?

149
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,918
I wish I knew.

150
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,514
Oh, oh.

151
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,071
SHERIFF: Joe Burch is on the warpath again.

152
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,035
- What'd you do this time?
- I forgot to tell him about Jacobs.

153
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,231
Well, good day, my very, very good friends.

154
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,878
A fine pair you turned out to be.

155
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,518
I practically had the paper put to bed...

156
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,352
when I found out about Jacobs by accident.

157
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,273
Well, I'm sorry, Joe. It slipped my mind.
What do you want to know?

158
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,918
Only what I haven't found out for myself.

159
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,434
I sneaked a look at the death certificate
over at Barney's.

160
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,795
Got the personal dope on him
out of Who's Who.

161
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,759
How often does this acromegalia occur, Doc?

162
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,157
Not very.
First time I've seen it, as a matter of fact.

163
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,073
BURCH: My dictionary says it's chronic,
it doesn't mention death.

164
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,318
Well, death doesn't usually come
from the disease itself.

165
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,078
It's caused by suffocation.

166
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,758
What do you mean, suffocation?

167
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,390
The tongue becomes enlarged.
The throat, the thorax, the heart...

168
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,357
everything gets pushed out of place.

169
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,030
What do you think
Deemer's been working on out there?

170
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,917
MATT: That I'd like to know.

171
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,629
I'll hop out with Ridley, grab a couple
of pictures, and see what I can find out.

172
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,914
By the way, Doc...

173
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,549
how long had Jacobs been dead when
our friend here remembered to call you?

174
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
- Will you lay off?
- Eight or ten hours.

175
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,555
Thanks, Doc.
I'll be sure to spell your name right.

176
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,631
As for your friend,
it might just slip my mind...

177
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,439
to support him the next time he comes up
for election.

178
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,192
Say, that's a good idea, Jack.
Him going out to Deemer's.

179
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,598
Joe will get him so riled up with questions,
he may take to me.

180
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,436
If you go into the hotel, miss,
they'll tell you the best way to get there.

181
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,919
Thank you.

182
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,350
I wonder if you might tell me the best way
to get out to the Deemer place?

183
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,590
- It's about...
- I know where it is.

184
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,557
Is there a bus or cab available?

185
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,950
Well, yes, but there won't be any buses
through anymore today.

186
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,432
Then would you mind calling a cab for me?

187
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,114
I wouldn't mind it a bit.
But it wouldn't do no good.

188
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,515
Because Jasper, you see, it's his cab.

189
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,592
He's out at the Bar Six
and won't be back for a couple of hours.

190
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,033
Maybe longer.

191
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,478
Well, what'll I do?

192
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,509
Sit down and wait. That's all you can do.

193
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,039
Thank you.

194
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,191
You ain't come through here before,
have you?

195
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,554
No.

196
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,311
Didn't think I'd seen you.

197
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,595
You any kin to this man, Deemer?

198
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,593
No, I'm not.

199
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,035
He any kin to you? Oh, no.

200
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,436
- I don't suppose that...
- I doubt it.

201
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,714
Me, too.

202
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,069
[Door opening]

203
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,555
Josh, I'm expecting a call from Dan Simon.

204
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,312
Switch it to the Deemer place, will you?

205
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,719
You going out there?

206
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,109
- Just leaving.
- Take her with you.

207
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,314
Well, you see,
I was asking how to get out there, but...

208
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,118
Well, I wouldn't want to impose on you.

209
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,679
He won't mind.

210
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,278
No, I'd be glad to drive you.

211
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,828
- Well, if you're sure.
- Are these yours?

212
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,669
Hey.

213
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,628
Ain't you two going
to introduce yourselves?

214
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,869
- No.
- No.

215
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,430
Getting to be a fast world.

216
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,508
Think it's about time?

217
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,717
- Dr. Matt Hastings.
- Stephanie Clayton. "Steve."

218
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,233
I like Steve.

219
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm really indebted to you,
Dr. Hastings, for this ride.

220
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,349
Or rather, I'm indebted to your friend Josh.

221
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,748
So am I.

222
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,394
I guess it's none of my business asking why
you're going out to Deemer's place, but...

223
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,595
Why not?

224
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,716
I'm doing graduate work in biology.

225
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,631
The professor teaches it, or he did.

226
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,593
I knew it would happen.

227
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,951
Give women the vote and what do you get?
Lady scientists.

228
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,511
Well, student so far.

229
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,195
You see, I wrote a paper on the nutritional
aspects of expanding populations...

230
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,113
and Prof. Jacobs read it
and offered me a job for the summer.

231
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,952
How about a place to live?

232
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,759
There are a couple of nice boarding houses
in Desert Rock.

233
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,195
- Cost less than a hotel.
- Well, no.

234
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,998
I'm going to stay at the professor's.

235
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,911
You see, it's all part of my contract.

236
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,629
I'll be laboratory technician, cook, student.
The whole works.

237
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,189
I see.

238
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,998
Well, it's one way of earning a master's.

239
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,834
And it's worth it working with people
like Deemer and Prof. Jacobs.

240
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,276
- How well did you know Eric Jacobs?
- I've never met him.

241
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,512
He just read the paper and liked it,
and that was that.

242
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,113
He's dead.

243
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,152
Died yesterday morning.

244
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,274
How?

245
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,350
Glandular condition called acromegalia.

246
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,678
Acromegalia? Isn't that a very rare disease?

247
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,113
Extremely.

248
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,073
Are you sure it was that?

249
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,677
No, I'm not sure at all.

250
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,595
He has a wonderful lab here.
One of the best.

251
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,877
Looks like nobody's home.

252
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,753
There must be someone.
That's Joe Burch's car over there.

253
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,675
Might as well.

254
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,829
The electric panel shorted.

255
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,150
And, well, you can see for yourself.

256
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,750
You estimated the amount of damage yet,
Professor?

257
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,797
The greatest damage, of course,
was to the work that was destroyed.

258
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,108
Let's get back to Jacobs.

259
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,270
- Why did he leave...
- I've told you all there is.

260
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,232
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

261
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,792
One more picture.

262
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,836
- Pat the monkey, Professor.
- I said that was all.

263
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,592
I think that ought to be enough, Joe.

264
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,797
- Professor's had a rough couple of days.
- Yes. Thank you, Dr. Hastings.

265
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,191
Thanks for the story, Professor.
I didn't mean to add to your troubles.

266
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,395
Come on, Ridley.

267
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,232
- See you later, Matt.
- See you, Joe.

268
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,956
I thought I'd never get rid of them.

269
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,271
You must forgive an old man.

270
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,753
- Have I met you before, miss?
- No.

271
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,594
This is Stephanie Clayton.
It seems Prof. Jacobs wrote for an assistant.

272
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,558
- She's it.
- Yes, Eric told me you were coming.

273
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,391
But I didn't expect to see a biologist
that looked like you.

274
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,956
That was intended as a compliment.

275
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,476
- I'm afraid I've gotten a bit rusty.
- Well, thank you, sir.

276
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,395
Well, I don't know that you'll want to stay on
with all that has happened...

277
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,198
You're welcome to, of course.

278
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,708
But Eric...

279
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,712
I know. Dr. Hastings told me on the way out.

280
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,229
I see.

281
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,475
Well, with Eric gone, I'm alone.

282
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,073
I'm sure I can be of service.

283
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,390
I mean,
if you're going to continue with your work.

284
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,758
Yes, indeed. For Eric's sake, if nothing else.

285
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,395
Wasn't Paul Lund working with you,
Prof. Deemer?

286
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,515
Paul...

287
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,272
STEVE: Yes, he was studying
for his doctorate...

288
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,395
when I was a freshman.

289
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,597
STEVE: I'd heard he came here.
DEEMER: Yes, of course.

290
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,911
Paul Lund. No, he's not with us anymore.

291
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,389
Well, come now, Miss Clayton.
Let me show you my lab.

292
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,631
- Are you interested at all, Doctor?
- Yes, of course.

293
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,628
I've put all I own into this.

294
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,319
It's my life.

295
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,798
Everything that I have and care for is here.

296
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,753
Unfortunately, part of it has been destroyed.

297
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,555
I see.

298
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,191
What's in the vial, Professor?

299
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,475
DEEMER: A nutrient.
STEVE: You mean a synthetic?

300
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,519
DEEMER: A completely nonorganic
food concentrate.

301
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,477
Medicine has lengthened the life span,
and people live longer.

302
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,358
But the food supply remains fairly static.

303
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,512
World population is increasing
at the rate of 25 million a year.

304
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,277
An overcrowded world.

305
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,115
That means not enough to eat.

306
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,995
The disease of hunger,
like most diseases, well, it spreads.

307
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,914
There are 2 billion people
in the world today.

308
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,556
In 1975 there will be 3 billion.

309
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,839
In the year 2000,
there will be 3 billion 625 million.

310
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,510
The world may not be able to produce
enough food to feed all these people.

311
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,918
Now perhaps you'll understand
what an inexpensive nutrient will mean.

312
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,719
Well, not many of us look that far
into the future, sir.

313
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,357
Our business is the future.

314
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,836
No man can do it on his own, of course.

315
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,718
You don't pull it out of your hat
like a magician's rabbit.

316
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,997
Well, you build on what hundreds of others
have learnt before you.

317
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,837
I thought that synthesis was impossible
without a bonding agent...

318
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,478
to hold everything together.

319
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,914
And we use the simplest of all: The atom.

320
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,319
Let me show you.

321
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,072
MATT: That's an isotope, isn't it?
DEEMER: A radioactive isotope.

322
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,874
DEEMER: Ammoniac.

323
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,748
- And that's what binds your solution?
- Binds it and triggers it.

324
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,276
Using it, Eric's dream and mine
may be a reality before...

325
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,839
[Telephone ringing]

326
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,189
Excuse me.

327
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,429
Hello?

328
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,115
Yes.

329
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,874
It's for you, Doctor.

330
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,828
Thank you.

331
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,754
Hello? Hi, Josh.

332
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,549
Of course.

333
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,108
Call her back.
Tell her I'll stop by on my way home.

334
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,515
Bye.

335
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,352
Sorry to break this up.

336
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,393
Thanks for the tour, Professor.

337
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,072
Maybe one of these days
you'll invite me back.

338
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,718
Why, yes, of course.

339
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,313
Professor, I...

340
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,476
I'm still puzzled by the speed with which
Jacobs' malformation developed.

341
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,754
Can you explain it?

342
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,796
Eric is dead and he shouldn't be.

343
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,548
But the cause was acromegalia.
Nothing else.

344
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,674
It seems such a deviation
from the classic cases.

345
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,516
You're being very diplomatic, Doctor.
Why don't you speak up?

346
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,391
Don't you think, sir,
this time you might be wrong?

347
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,119
In this case, no.

348
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,676
You want to do an autopsy. Why don't you?

349
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,035
- Well, you objected.
- I was upset.

350
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,790
Eric was not only my colleague,
he was my closest friend.

351
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,278
- You have my permission.
- Well, thank you, sir.

352
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,277
I'll let you know what I find.

353
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,715
And please, don't forget to invite me back?

354
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,758
- Well, now I'll show you to your quarters.
- All right.

355
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,310
MATT: That you, Jack?
SHERIFF: How're you coming?

356
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,277
MATT: Be right with you.

357
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,234
What you got?

358
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,029
I'll give it to you fast, Jack. Nothing.

359
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,118
Nothing?
You mean the professor was right?

360
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,313
Couldn't have been more right.

361
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,549
Well, how do you like that?

362
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,030
You make a big thing out of it, show Deemer
up for maybe a murderer and then...

363
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,031
You want me to go ahead
with the interment, Jack?

364
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,829
You might as well before this amateur
gumshoe gets any more bright ideas.

365
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,953
The case is closed.

366
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,791
And the next time I need a doctor,
I'll call one in from Phoenix.

367
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,000
You know,
I don't think Jack's too happy about all this.

368
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,752
I don't blame him.

369
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,671
But I still can't figure it out.

370
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,230
Slowly, slow.

371
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,229
That's good.

372
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,959
Take your time, Steve, take your time.

373
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,310
We have nothing except time.

374
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,750
And we won't have that
if we make a mistake.

375
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,315
There.

376
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,956
- Am I doing all right, Professor?
- Fine!

377
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,000
Now lift the lid onto the vial.

378
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,073
DEEMER: Easy.

379
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,477
That's it. Now lift up the graduated glass...

380
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,916
and put it in the access chamber.

381
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,558
Well done, Steve.

382
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,751
Now lift up the chamber.

383
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,474
That's it.

384
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,833
Now we'll take this into the dry box...

385
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,434
where we can handle it safely.

386
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,037
You're getting quite expert at this.

387
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,190
I don't know what I'd do without you.

388
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,510
Now let's see how we make out.

389
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,232
It's one thing to develop a formula on paper,
another to make it work.

390
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,438
DEEMER: So far we've found an almost
consistent instability in the material.

391
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,353
One batch of nutrient varies sharply
from the next.

392
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,476
What do you want to try it on this time?

393
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,718
One of the baby rats?

394
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,274
Okay.

395
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,949
How long before we know anything,
Professor?

396
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,237
Well, there have been times
when the instability has caused death.

397
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,072
I meant, if it works.

398
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,799
Let me show you.

399
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,316
- You see that rabbit?
- Yes.

400
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,991
How old would you say he was?

401
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,673
STEVE: Four months.

402
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,589
DEEMER: Look at the chart.

403
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,353
Six days!

404
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,269
Is it normal?

405
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,591
I ran a reflex test on him
after you went to bed last night.

406
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,557
The only difference between him
and the others...

407
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,359
is that he's healthier and stronger.

408
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,034
All the same,
we mustn't be in too much of a hurry.

409
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,793
We've got to lick this problem of instability.

410
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,557
Once we can control that,
we're ready for the ultimate test: On humans.

411
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,037
There mustn't be a mistake this time.

412
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,759
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right, Steve.

413
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,308
Science is science,
but a girl must get her hair done.

414
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,868
You'd better hurry though,
if you're going to catch that bus.

415
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,996
- It only stops on signal, you know.
- I know.

416
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,672
- Anything I can get for you?
- No, thanks.

417
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,637
We'll run those tissue tests
when you come back.

418
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,836
- Right.
- Have fun.

419
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,353
Have the prescription refilled
and be sure she takes it after every meal.

420
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,876
Okay, Doc, but you know women.
Mary will just let it sit on the shelf.

421
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,235
Yeah, but she'll feel better
knowing it's there, won't she?

422
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,435
Yeah, I suppose so.

423
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,829
Say, when are you and me flying out
for some more fishing?

424
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,229
- It's been four or five weeks since...
- Excuse me, Jim.

425
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,309
Steve!

426
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,715
- Carry your books, miss?
- Thanks!

427
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,235
I haven't been walked to school
in a long time.

428
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,556
Hey, you dress up our town very nicely.

429
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,517
If you don't look out,
the Chamber of Commerce...

430
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,275
is going to list you
in their publicity with the local attractions.

431
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,119
Say, do you have to go right back?

432
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,989
No.

433
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,913
- Good, let's skip school.
- All right.

434
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,992
It's like an oasis.

435
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,908
- I bring all my patients here.
- I'll bet.

436
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,191
- How's this?
- Fine.

437
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,234
Not now, thanks.

438
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,632
How are you getting along with Deemer?

439
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,551
Half the time he doesn't know I'm there...

440
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,108
and the other half
he's worried I'll make a mistake.

441
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,475
- He's quite a guy, I guess.
- Yes.

442
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,799
Has he said anything more
about that assistant that left?

443
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,269
No.

444
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,791
How's the nutrient coming along?

445
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,678
Well, this is the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

446
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,872
How long does it take an ordinary rabbit
to reach full growth?

447
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,754
I don't know. Four or five months, I guess.

448
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,593
He has one there that's reached maturity
in six days.

449
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,111
- Six days?
- I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true.

450
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,191
It's still so new and unpredictable.

451
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,555
There are all sorts of things
to take into account...

452
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,200
before we can even think
of experimenting on humans.

453
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,159
Some of the nutrient, when unstable,
has even been deadly.

454
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,429
But we do know that it's kept animals alive
that have been fed nothing else.

455
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,679
If I stay here much longer
I'm going to miss my bus.

456
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,433
Who can ask for a better opening?
I'm at your service, miss.

457
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,636
Are you sure your patients can spare you?

458
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,950
I'm such a good doctor, they never get sick.

459
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,437
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.

460
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,272
No wonder you love the desert.

461
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,032
It's so beautiful.

462
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,711
Everything that ever walked or crawled
on the face of the earth...

463
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,438
swum the depths of the ocean...

464
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,159
soared through the sky
has left its imprint here.

465
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,394
Look.

466
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,675
Did you ever wonder
what piled them up like that?

467
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,637
Wind? Water? What?

468
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,231
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Can we stop?

469
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,469
Sure.

470
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,030
STEVE: All this was once an ocean,
wasn't it?

471
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,833
You can still find seashells
if you keep your eyes open.

472
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,912
- What's that?
- I...

473
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,629
- There he is.
- It scared me.

474
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,998
I'm beginning to see now
why you love it here.

475
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,473
Catching, huh?

476
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,955
I think I'll have that cigarette now.

477
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,993
Thank you.

478
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,999
You know,
it must look out of this world from the air.

479
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,833
- I'll show it to you sometime.
- Will you really?

480
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,759
What does it look like?

481
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,274
Like something from another life.

482
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,391
Serene, quiet, yet strangely evil...

483
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,996
as if it were hiding its secret from man.

484
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,277
You make it sound so creepy.

485
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,952
The unknown always is.

486
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,552
- Whatever could have started it?
- I don't know.

487
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,953
Well, I think I've had enough
of the unknown for one afternoon.

488
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,154
Something must have started it.

489
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,989
You can't second-guess the desert.

490
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,198
Rocks that have stayed for 1,000 years,
they just move.

491
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,711
There's no figuring it.

492
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,596
Well, the bus would have gotten me here
sooner, but I certainly enjoyed it.

493
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,717
- Give my best to the rabbits.
- Would you like to see them?

494
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,631
Now you're talking.

495
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,715
You can put them right there.

496
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,636
It's funny he's not here. Maybe he's resting.

497
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,393
- Do I get the guided tour?
- Follow me.

498
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,875
It wasn't like that when I left!

499
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,955
MATT: Are you sure it's the same one?

500
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,268
STEVE: Yes.

501
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,270
We injected a baby rat this morning.
Let's take a look at it.

502
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,349
MATT: This morning?
STEVE: It was a baby.

503
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,399
Matt, I tell you, this morning it was a baby.

504
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
And it doubled in size in a few hours?

505
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,316
Matt, you do believe me?

506
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,033
Of course I do.

507
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,838
[Telephone ringing]

508
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,629
Hello?

509
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,472
Yes, he's here. Just a minute.

510
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,358
It's your office.

511
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,949
Thanks. Hello?

512
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,559
Yeah, Josh.

513
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,951
I'll stop by on my way home. Thanks. Bye.

514
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,553
I've got to go.

515
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,035
That's one of the penalties
of being a doctor.

516
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,634
I never seem to find time
to finish a conversation.

517
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,438
What do you make of that baby rat?

518
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,953
I don't know.

519
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,918
Freaks of any kind give me the willies.

520
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,719
Well, I've heard of giantism,
but I've never seen it produced.

521
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,394
Why don't you have Deemer ask me out
in the next day or so.

522
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,755
- I'd like to discuss it with him.
- I will.

523
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,673
Besides,
it'll give me a chance to see you again.

524
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,239
Or don't I need an excuse?

525
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,039
- Now, what do you think?
- I'll call you.

526
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,718
My laboratory is not open to the public,
Miss Clayton.

527
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,633
Explain why you brought Dr. Hastings here.

528
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,280
- Sir?
- Dr. Hastings.

529
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,957
Will you please explain
why you brought him here?

530
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,476
He's very interested in your work,
sir, and I thought it'd be all...

531
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,916
Were you in the habit of conducting tours
at Owens University?

532
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,638
No, sir, but I thought it would...

533
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,359
Bringing him here
was a breach of my trust in you.

534
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,513
Experimental research is always confidential
be it here or anywhere else.

535
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,114
You didn't tell me it was confidential.

536
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,236
I didn't think I'd need to.

537
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,238
Professor, your face.

538
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,357
- That will be enough, Miss Clayton.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,990
- Boy, you got nerves. Simmer down.
- Where did you come from?

540
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,436
I was on my way to old Andy Andersen's
when I saw your car.

541
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,192
What are you doing here?

542
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,510
There was a landslide an hour or so ago.

543
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,558
- Came back to see what caused it.
- This is one of those days.

544
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,200
Old Andy called me in a sweat
and said to come a running.

545
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,157
Couldn't figure out
what he was yakking about...

546
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,595
but it seems like
something was eating his cattle.

547
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,750
- Eating them?
- Say...

548
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,072
He had sunstroke a couple of years back.
You don't suppose...

549
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,233
No, there must be something to it.
Said he had a stack of bones to show me.

550
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,709
You wouldn't like to come along,
would you?

551
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,519
You still trust my judgement
after the Jacobs business?

552
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,672
I ain't looking for medical advice, Doc.
Just company.

553
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,510
Glad you finally got here, Sheriff.

554
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,078
Hi, Doc. Didn't expect to see you.

555
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,958
Hi, Andy. Jack met me on the way.
Told me you've been having trouble.

556
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,316
- Yeah, darndest thing ever happened.
- Where's what we came for?

557
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,674
Let's go.

558
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,678
SHERIFF: I never saw anything like it.

559
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,354
No footprints, no blood, no sign of struggle.

560
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,750
The bones just stripped clean,
like peeling a banana.

561
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,270
About noon the boy here came up
from the lower section and found them.

562
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,510
I don't suppose
it could've been mountain lions?

563
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,431
I've ranched here 22 years now, Doc...

564
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,829
and I've had more than my share
of lions and wolves.

565
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,478
It wasn't them.

566
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,753
MATT: Where did that come from?
ANDY: It was there when the boy got here.

567
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,752
Stop worrying about that
and tell me what's picking my cattle clean.

568
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,478
That's all I want to know. What's doing it?

569
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,471
- Take it easy, Andy.
- They're not your cattle.

570
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,632
If it could happen last night,
it could happen tonight, tomorrow night.

571
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,517
It could wipe me out.

572
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,713
Aren't you going to do anything?

573
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,031
I'm up a tree, Andy, like you are.
I don't know where to start thinking.

574
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,031
You got any ideas, Doc?

575
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,869
Better round up what livestock you can
and stand guard.

576
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,951
If you see or hear anything,
ring me at the house.

577
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,110
I'll be there, just in case.

578
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,879
See you, Andy.

579
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,154
Hi, Jack.

580
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,199
Anyone pull through?

581
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,113
You kidding?
I want to show you something.

582
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,273
Morning, Doc.

583
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,398
The Sheriff tells me
you've seen something like this before.

584
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,595
Yeah.

585
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,348
You buying this accident business, Doc?

586
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,512
- Aren't you?
- Nope.

587
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,990
I can't figure it. There isn't a skid mark.

588
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,753
We ploughed through the wreck
and found the brakes still work.

589
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,196
It's just like something grabbed the pickup
and threw it 30 feet off the road.

590
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,271
Take a look at this, Doc.

591
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,436
I can't understand
why I didn't spot this stuff...

592
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,990
when I hauled those skeletons out of here
and stacked them on the other side.

593
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,389
- They were here?
- Yes, sir. Why?

594
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,032
There doesn't seem to be
any distinctive odour.

595
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,115
Wow.

596
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,119
Say, have you got a thermos
or a jar around here somewhere?

597
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,031
I think there's one over here.

598
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,556
- Same stuff we found at Andy's?
- Yeah, I think so.

599
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,710
Well, that makes three then.

600
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,915
Three?

601
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,594
Here, the stuff you saw yesterday,
and Andy's.

602
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,715
Andy?

603
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,234
His wife found him at the corral last night,
dead.

604
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,278
He'd been... Like the cattle and sheep.

605
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,274
There was a couple of gallons of this liquid
beside him.

606
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,476
I wish you'd give me a hand with this yarn,
Doc.

607
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,834
Stuff here I can't handle.

608
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,990
MATT: Maybe there's stuff here
none of us can.

609
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,719
If I were you, Joe,
I'd write this as a straight accident.

610
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,950
If you print anything as vague
as what we've got...

611
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,837
you'll scare half the state to death.

612
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,674
BURCH: News is news, Doc.
MATT: Guess and a half-truth aren't news.

613
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,069
Why don't you hold off
till we nail this down tight?

614
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,310
Maybe then you'll have the biggest story
of your life.

615
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,551
- What have you got, Matt?
- I don't know.

616
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,753
But we've got to keep our minds open
and our mouths shut till we do know.

617
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,353
Here you are, Doc.

618
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,668
Thanks.

619
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,189
Well?

620
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,874
I'm not sure.

621
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,555
It's impossible at this stage
to give you a positive answer.

622
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,437
But it's related to insect venom.

623
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,636
- Insect venom?
- Come off it, Matt.

624
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,836
I know. But it checks.

625
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,195
Acidic content, the whole works.

626
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,990
I'm not sure what kind of insect venom it is,
but...

627
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,877
Look, Matt, I'm willing
to play ball with you...

628
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,996
but there's a limit to what I'll swallow.

629
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,830
Check it yourself, Joe. I'll show you how.

630
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,273
You're having nightmares, Doc.

631
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,794
There's not an insect in the world
with that much venom.

632
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,236
All right, don't take my word for it.
Get someone else to analyse it.

633
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,550
- Who?
- Prof. Deemer.

634
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,552
Hey, that's a good idea.

635
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,710
I'll make a date with him. Take the stuff out.
Okay?

636
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,915
Okay.

637
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,309
- This time don't you forget to let me know.
- I won't, Joe.

638
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,359
Insect venom in the large economy size.
I've heard everything.

639
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,914
Give me Prof. Deemer will you, Josh?

640
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,797
[Telephone ringing]

641
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,034
Hello?

642
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,272
Hello, Matt.

643
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,149
No, I can talk. He's upstairs.

644
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,073
STEVE: I was hoping you'd call. There's...

645
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,000
Matt, I've got to talk to you.

646
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,357
Well, he's sick, Matt, terribly sick.

647
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,274
It's his face and his hands.

648
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,676
Yes. Well, I did.

649
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,672
I asked him to see a doctor,
but he won't do any...

650
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,996
Steve? Steve!

651
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,196
She hung up, Doc.
You want me to try to get her back?

652
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,958
Hurry, Matt!

653
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,753
- Are you all right?
- Something's happened.

654
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,637
He can hardly breathe!

655
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,548
Steve, get me some water, will you?

656
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,149
Don't you think we ought to get him
to a hospital?

657
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,199
There isn't anything they can do for him
we can't do right here.

658
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,670
Give him some water, Steve.

659
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,036
There's nothing you can do, Doctor.

660
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,839
- Don't say that.
- Nothing anyone can do.

661
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,995
Start with Jacobs, Professor.
He was the beginning.

662
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,078
Eric and I spent every waking hour
on this ever since our...

663
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,878
days at Oakridge.

664
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,508
But he was an impatient old man.

665
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,431
He was convinced that...

666
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,713
an occasional failure with the animals...

667
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,635
didn't necessarily mean...

668
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,032
that the nutrient would fail with humans.

669
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,628
Then...

670
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,475
one day when I was in town...

671
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,713
he and Paul...

672
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,872
injected themselves.

673
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,754
When did Jacobs inject himself, sir?

674
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,431
Four days before he died.

675
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,148
Acromegalia developed in four days.

676
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,788
The isotope triggered our nutrient
into a nightmare.

677
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,308
Then...

678
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,196
Paul went crazy and attacked me.

679
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,393
While I was unconscious,
he made sure that I wouldn't survive.

680
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,514
But I...

681
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,716
continued the experiment...

682
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,675
hoping that in the short time...

683
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,115
left to me, I'd be able...

684
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,238
to prove the...

685
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,079
nutrient...

686
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,749
would work.

687
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,830
You should have seen them.

688
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,110
You should have seen them.

689
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,113
You should have seen them before the fire.

690
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,793
They lived on nothing but our nutrient.

691
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,956
A rat eight times normal size.

692
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,712
A guinea pig big as a police dog.

693
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,318
A tarantula...

694
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,838
Lost, all lost.

695
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,511
What about the tarantula?

696
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,674
Burnt.

697
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,433
All burnt.

698
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,831
Let's take him upstairs.

699
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,678
- He'll sleep for a while.
- Is there any hope?

700
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,077
Here's something to relieve the pain.

701
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,071
Give him one when he wakes up.

702
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,957
Where are you going?

703
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,076
Well, the tarantula...

704
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,953
There's something I want to check on.
I'll phone you when I get back.

705
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,837
- Just set it up, Jean. Then you may go.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,639
Well, that was a pretty accurate analysis
you made, Doctor.

707
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,153
Then it is insect venom?

708
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,596
Well, not precisely.
It's from a species called arachnida.

709
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,558
- A spider?
- Well, a tarantula, to be exact.

710
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,156
But I've never seen venom
in such quantity before.

711
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,037
You know,
there's more venom in this test-tube...

712
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,917
than you'll find in 100 tarantulas.

713
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,959
You mean a tarantula that could secrete
that much venom, would be...

714
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,996
100 times larger than normal?

715
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,593
At least that.

716
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,429
What would you say, Doctor,
if I told you I found pools of that venom?

717
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,796
Four and five feet across,
two to three inches deep?

718
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,075
I'd say you'd been having a nightmare.

719
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,357
Or that you're the biggest liar
since Baron Munchausen.

720
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,032
It's a nightmare all right, Doctor...

721
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,509
but not the kind you mean,
and I'm not lying to you.

722
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,068
- The tarantula film is ready, Professor.
- Thank you, Jean.

723
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,754
Now look, I know you didn't fly 200 miles
just for a joke...

724
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,990
but I simply can't believe
all you're telling me.

725
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,230
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jean.

726
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,154
Well, under the circumstances
we might find this interesting.

727
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,351
TOWNSEND: That's the largest of tarantulas,
from South America...

728
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,908
and it's only a foot in diameter
with its legs outstretched.

729
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,992
MATT: I know.
Our Arizona species is even smaller.

730
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,355
TOWNSEND: That's right.
Not more than three inches in size.

731
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,954
Now there it is, coming out of its burrow.

732
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,639
It's got eight legs
and can move faster than you think...

733
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,679
which assures him of a long life.
As long as 25 years sometimes.

734
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,390
That's the spider wasp...

735
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,471
the tarantula's deadliest enemy.

736
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,996
See? The wasp usually wins...

737
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,278
but don't count on it, because the tarantula
doesn't know the meaning of fear.

738
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,548
As you can see,
he'll back down a rattlesnake if he has to.

739
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,755
See?

740
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,599
MATT: They're flesh eaters, aren't they?

741
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,638
TOWNSEND: Yes, and desert beetles
are their usual diet.

742
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,871
Those powerful jaws are strong enough
to pierce a man's finger.

743
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,315
There. The venom is paralysing the victim.

744
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,269
Tarantulas predigest their food by flooding
the wound with a powerful solvent...

745
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,079
so that the flesh can be sucked
into the body.

746
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,798
MATT: That would account for the bones.

747
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,713
TOWNSEND: Dr. Hastings,
your imagination is showing.

748
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,437
So that's it, Doctor.

749
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,877
- How deadly is the venom?
- Not deadly at all.

750
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,997
About as poisonous as a hornet's.

751
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,355
No fun, mind you, but harmless.

752
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,188
The few deaths that have been reported
are the result...

753
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,953
of germs entering the wound
at the time of the bite.

754
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,918
- You make them sound like pets.
- Not pets, Doctor.

755
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,797
Just part of the world about us.

756
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,758
We must accept them as we do
the rest of God's creatures.

757
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,434
Each has a function in its own world.

758
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,912
But what if circumstances magnified
one of them in size and strength?

759
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,470
Took it out of its primitive world
and turned it loose in ours?

760
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,551
Then expect something that's fiercer...

761
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,599
more cruel and deadly
than anything that ever walked the earth.

762
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,836
How about Dr. Hastings' call
to Desert Rock?

763
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,911
I'm afraid I won't be able to get it for you.

764
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,036
The lines are down between Calamite
and Desert Rock.

765
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,714
Be about an hour
before they can resume service.

766
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,314
- How'd that happen?
- I really don't know, sir.

767
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,834
Do you want me to try again
in about an hour?

768
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,911
No. Never mind. Thanks.

769
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,432
ED: Here you are, Jeb.

770
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,391
Going to be a murky night.

771
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,195
Yeah.

772
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,957
ED: Do you think that was lightning we saw
over to the west?

773
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,999
JEB: If it was, it's the first time
I ever seen lightning throw off sparks.

774
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,993
ED: Maybe one of them college boys
short-circuited his nice new Geiger counter.

775
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,399
[Both laughing]

776
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,993
ED: What was that?

777
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,152
[Heavy footsteps]

778
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,479
[Roaring]

779

[Plane landing]

780
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,713
MATT: I'm at the airport.
SHERIFF: Oh.

781
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,030
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, yeah.

782
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,951
Jack, we haven't much time.

783
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,349
I want you to round up every available man.
Arm them...

784
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,510
Do what? What are you talking about?

785
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,919
Jack, do as I say.

786
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,673
Notify the State Police to meet you
at the Deemer place.

787
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,149
Notify the State Police? You must be drunk.

788
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,673
No. I haven't been drinking.

789
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,718
- All I want you to do is...
- I know. Just call the State Police.

790
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,233
Please, Jack. Believe me.

791
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,038
All right, I'll do it.

792
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,599
Thanks. I'll see you.

793
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,752
[Steve screaming]

794
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,512
[Steve screaming]

795
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,872
[Dramatic instrumental music]

796
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,190
He's coming, Matt, I can see it!

797
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,158
There's Matt's car.

798
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,631
- What's it all about?
- Jack, turn the cars around!

799
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,676
- What for?
- There isn't time. I'll tell you later!

800
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,432
Lieutenant, look!

801
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,877
Jumping Jupiter!

802
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,313
Get those submachine guns!
You boys, get back in the car.

803
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,799
They won't stop it!

804
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,158
Matt, if it follows the highway,
it'll come right into Desert Rock.

805
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,196
NOLAN: Doc, keys in your car?
MATT: Yeah.

806
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,157
NOLAN: Doc and Miss Clayton
are coming with us.

807
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,595
Get in. You boys, try to slow it down.

808
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,195
- If you can't, take Doc's car and follow us.
- Yes, sir.

809

[Machine guns firing]

810
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,112
- Come on. Start it, man!
- I can't start it.

811
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,553
Come on, you'll flood it.

812
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,793
[Snarling]

[Men screaming]

814
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,509
That is correct.

815
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,115
You've got at the outside
30 minutes to get everybody out. Over.

816
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,873
MAN: [On radio] Desert Rock will be
cleared in 30 minutes. Over.

817
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,996
Do you think dynamite would stop him?

818
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,470
Get a truck over to Murphy's,
load up all the dynamite he has.

819
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,199
Bring it just north of Devil's Rock.
We'll be waiting for it.

820
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,795
Yeah, dynamite might work.
But what if it doesn't?

821
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,714
You got any other suggestions, Doc?
It'll be light soon.

822
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,109
If we could get a message to the air base
at Sands.

823
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,758
SHERIFF: How are you going to do that?

824
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,991
- Somebody could phone from town.
- Unless the lines are down.

825
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,709
Sergeant, I want you to phone
the commanding officer at Sands Air Base.

826
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,518
Any special instructions, Doc?

827
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,433
Yeah. If the boys have some napalm,
tell them to bring it along.

828
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,957
Sergeant, tell them to load up with napalm,
rockets, anything they've got.

829
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,669
Hurry it up, boys!

830
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,350
- That's the last of it, Mr. Murphy.
- That's it, Joe.

831
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,556
There isn't another stick of dynamite
in the whole town.

832
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,755
Here. Prime them on the way.

833
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,398
- See you later, I hope.
- You will.

834
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,232
All right. Let her roll!

835
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,390
Don't forget to prime them!

Pull her in here.

01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,631
- Across the road.
- Shake it up, boys! Lend a hand!

841
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,234
Watch it now! Put the boxes
right down there across the road.

All right, let's go.

843
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,991
NOLAN: Come on, boys.
Get them down here!

844
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,992
- All right. Here we go.
- Come on, get that dynamite down here.

845
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,674
All right. Beautiful.

846
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,998
- Do you think it will work?
- Dynamite's tricky stuff.

847
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,799
It may blow it up.
It may just blow the highway up.

848
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,836
Doggone, I wish we had some nitro.

849
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,150
I'll have to see that tarantula
before I believe it.

850
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,834
You'll see it, Joe,
and you'll wish you hadn't.

851
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,276
Let's go! Get those wires hooked up.

852
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,153
Here he comes!

853
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,234
Holy cow!

854
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,072
Come on! Get back!

855
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,633
- Let's go!
- Come on.

856
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,073
Get this truck turned around!

857
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,714
Let's go!

858
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,114
Hold it!

859
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,359
We've gotta hurry it up.

860
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,355
Hurry it up.

861
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,589
I got it.

862
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,434
Steady.

863
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,675
Now!

864
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,717
Let's get out of here.

865
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,109
What now?

866
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,394
- I don't know.
- We got to do something.

867
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,755
Biggest story of my life
and I won't get a chance to write it.

868
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,829
[Screaming] Look!

869
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,356
Look, here they come!

870
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,279
Look at them!

871
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,670
All right, Betts.
Fire two rockets on this first pass.

872
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,759
Here goes.

873
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,794
Dropping napalm. Follow in order.

874
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,793
Dump them all.
