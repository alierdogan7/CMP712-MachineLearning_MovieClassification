1
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:13,330
I remember the first war.

2
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:16,702
The way the sky burned.

3
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:19,708
The faces of angeIs
destroyed.

4
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:29,513
I saw a third of
Heaven's Iegion banished...

5
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:32,180
and the creation of HeII.

6
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:38,354
I stood with my brothers
and watched Lucifer faII.

7
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:45,629
But now my brothers
are not brothers.

8
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:49,638
And we have come here,
where we are mortaI,

9
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:53,335
to steaI a dark souI
not yet Lucifer's...

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,344
to serve our cause.

11
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:00,583
I have aIways obeyed.

12
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,686
But I never thought
the war...

13
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,757
wouId happen again.

14
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:25,267
Come to our heIp,
Lord, HoIy Father,

15
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,599
aImighty
and eternaI God.

16
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:30,606
You are the source of every honor
and dignity,

17
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:33,108
of aII progress
and stabiIity.

18
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:36,942
You watch over the growing famiIy of man
by Your gift of wisdom...

19
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,072
and Your pattern of order.

20
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:42,346
When You had appointed high priests
to ruIe Your peopIe,

21
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,855
You chose other men next to them
in rank and dignity...

22
00:02:45,922 --> 00:02:48,857
to be with them and to
heIp them in their task.

23
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:51,860
And so there grew up
the ranks of priests...

24
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:56,422
and the offices of Levites
estabIished by sacred rites.

25
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:00,492
In the desert You extended
the spirit of Moses to 70 wise men...

26
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,903
who heIped him to ruIe
the great company of his peopIe.

27
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:08,569
He shared among the sons of Aaron
the fuIIness of their father's power,

28
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:12,081
to provide worthy priests
in sufficient number...

29
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:15,444
for the increasing rites
of sacrifice and worship.

30
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:20,080
With the same Ioving care You gave
companions to Your Son's apostIes...

31
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,590
to heIp in teaching
the faith,

32
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,527
they preached the GospeI
to the whoIe worId.

33
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:34,603
Let Joseph, who is
to be ordained priest,

34
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,605
come forward.

35
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:51,020
Lord, I am not worthy to receive You,
but say the word and I shaII be heaIed.

36
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:03,962
AImighty Father, grant to this servant
of Yours the dignity of the priesthood.

37
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,968
Renew within him
the spirit of hoIiness...

38
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:10,597
as a coworker with
the Order of Bishops.

39
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:13,938
We ask this through
our Lord Jesus Christ.

40
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,478
One God,
forever and ever.

41
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:18,480
Amen.

42
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:33,819
Let Thomas, who is
to be ordained priest, come forward.

43
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:46,602
Some peopIe Iose their faith
because Heaven shows them too IittIe.

44
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,605
But how many peopIe Iose their faith
because Heaven shows them too much?

45
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:55,711
Years Iater, of aII the gospeIs
I Iearned in seminary schooI,

46
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:58,713
a verse from St. PauI
stays with me.

47
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:02,717
It is perhaps the strangest passage
in the BibIe, in which he writes:

48
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:06,380
"Even now in Heaven there were angeIs
carrying savage weapons."

49
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,471
Hey, you're not
supposed to be up here.

50
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,807
Sorry.

51
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,434
Don't fuckin' move.

52
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,437
You don't need a gun,
Thomas.

53
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:57,803
Who are you?

54
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:01,207
Everything used to be
much simpIer, didn't it?

55
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:03,472
Get down, sIow.

56
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:07,380
- Everyone thinks they know
what Heaven is Iike.
- Turn around. Turn around!

57
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,146
- Heaven isn't Heaven anymore.
- Now, take it easy.

58
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:13,916
- Thomas-- Thomas!
- CaIm down. Take it easy.
- WiII you Iisten?

59
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,254
I was in the church
that day.

60
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,260
I know what you saw.

61
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:24,129
I know why you Ieft
your faith on that fIoor.

62
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,134
What do you want?

63
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:31,572
You have no idea
what this is Iike for me.

64
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:41,415
"A Thesis on AngeIs
in ReIigious Scripture"...

65
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:43,816
by Thomas Dagget.

66
00:07:43,886 --> 00:07:46,821
Do you stiII beIieve...

67
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,823
any of it?

68
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:53,021
- You're asking me as a cop?
- As a priest.

69
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:55,155
But I'm not a priest.

70
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:03,597
St. Christopher.

71
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,642
"Go your way in safety."

72
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,377
Do you beIieve...

73
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:19,046
that you're part
of God's pIan,

74
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,851
Thomas?

75
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:24,216
That's a compIicated question.

76
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:27,228
No, it isn't.

77
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,967
You found it, haven't you?

78
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,836
You can't keep it from us,
Simon!

11:20,901
That's it. Go ahead.

79
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,904
AII right.

80
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,406
Why don't you
caII it in?

81
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:29,410
WeII, Iook at this. Tommy Dagget
actuaIIy Iit by the Iight of morning.

82
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:33,175
What am I doin' here, Burrows? I work
nights. It's not even my division.

83
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,183
WeII, we'II get to that.

84
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,687
- Our friend here did a haIf-gainer
from the fourth fIoor.
- Jumper?

85
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:42,190
Not unIess he decided not to bother
opening the window first.

86
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:45,352
81, cIear. Unit 14, cIear.

87
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,264
Was he fucked up
or what?

88
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:53,928
WeII, he wasn't exactIy in condition
to waIk a chaIk Iine when we got here.

89
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:56,699
You're weIcome to smeII his breath,
if you Iike.

90
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:59,206
He is missing
one or two things, though.

91
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,937
- What's that?
- His eyes.

92
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,275
Maybe they're stuck
in the radiator griII.

93
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:08,616
Who's the room
registered under?

94
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:11,118
- John Smith.
- Anything interesting inside?

95
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,122
WeII, there are what an experienced
detective Iike yourseIf...

96
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,182
couId possibIy construe
as signs of a struggIe.

97
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,858
Of course, nobody saw
or heard anything.

98
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:28,461
- PIace been dusted?
- Yeah. Nothing.

99
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,256
Kinda weird, huh,
somebody carrying that around?

100
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:51,760
That's why Lieutenant Deason
had me caII you down on this.

101
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:54,261
Any ideas
what it's doin' here?

102
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:57,799
No.

103
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:00,993
"For it was there
at Nicene...

104
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,004
that the worId's
fourth-century bishops...

105
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:07,008
decIared that with the sacrifice
of God's Son man became one with God,

106
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:10,011
for the first time
Iifted above aII other creations...

107
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,013
to stand at His side
in Heaven."

108
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:15,573
You been hoIdin' out on me.
I never knew you couId read and write.

109
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,778
That measures eight feet.

110
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,311
- Where's Chimney Rock?
- Okay, Iet's move.

111
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,324
Arizona.

112
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:27,158
It's where I'II be
in two years and three months.

113
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:30,164
You gonna give aII this up?

114
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:34,168
You're breakin' my heart.

115
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,500
Don't forget
to tip the maid.

116
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:10,322
# Amen #

117
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:16,763
# Amen ##

118
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:57,635
Hey, what's the big idea
of sitting out here aII aIone?

119
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,242
Someone's here.

120
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:05,747
Where?

121
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:08,248
Pig out
on aII the cake?

122
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:11,115
No.

123
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:15,624
But there, there might be one teeny,
tiny IittIe piece Ieft.

124
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:18,489
But you'II have to
race me for it.

125
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:21,689
- What's that?
- Where?

126
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,899
Oh, you sneak!

127
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:46,147
Tommy. A IittIe earIy
for you, isn't it?

128
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:49,048
Joseph.

129
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,052
- They got you workin' days?
- Yeah.

130
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,055
Huh.
Tyson, sIow down.

131
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:57,058
- Everybody's dead.
- Do you got any more of this?

132
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,991
No.

133
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,495
AII right, where
do you wanna start?

134
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:04,589
WeII, I think we couId
skip the cause of death.

135
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,101
Why don't we begin
with his eyes?

136
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,103
Your man has none.

137
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:11,605
What, they weren't
in the radiator griII?

138
00:19:11,674 --> 00:19:14,108
No, I mean,
he never had any.

139
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:16,610
No opticaI fibers,
no muscIe pores, zip.

140
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,614
We did a toxicoIogy
on his bIood, you know,

141
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:23,049
- Iooking for the usuaI--
coke, booze, sugar.
- What'd you come up with?

142
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,143
High sodium,
eIevated erythrocytes,

143
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,654
no fIoating choIesteroI pIateIets,
trace of ammonia.

144
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:30,487
- What's so unusuaI about that?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

145
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,493
ActuaIIy,
it's pretty common...

146
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:34,495
for an aborted fetus.

147
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,861
- Fetus?
- We aIso did a bone section.

148
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:39,833
It wasn't much troubIe; most of them
were sticking out of his chest anyway.

149
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,631
Okay. And?

150
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,138
When a baby grows,
their bones get Iarger...

151
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:48,142
by having caIcium Iayers form over the
haversian canaIs. Are you with me?

152
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,543
- I'm with you.
- This Ieaves growth rings;
everybody's got 'em.

153
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,478
Except our paI here.

154
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,074
Oh.
And this is for you.

155
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,585
He's aIso a hermaphrodite.
Ohh!

156
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:02,146
He's got both maIe
and femaIe sex organs.

157
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:04,158
- Think of the possibiIities.
- Yeah.

158
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:09,027
He couId be impotent and frigid at
the same time. They don't normaIIy work.

159
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:12,033
We found this
in the Iining of his coat.

160
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:15,269
- It's an oId BibIe.
- Yeah.

161
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:18,272
Handwritten.
BeautifuI, reaIIy.

162
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,901
See this symboI?
Matches a scar on his neck.

163
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,002
ExactIy the same.

164
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,343
That's attractive, huh?

165
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:31,052
Anything eIse?

166
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
There's a veIvet
book marker.

167
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,225
- Cute.
- What is it?

168
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:41,592
Twenty-third chapter of
St. John's ReveIations.

169
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,598
And?

170
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,600
There is no
23rd chapter.

171
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:50,830
WeII, maybe this is
the teacher's edition.

172
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:54,069
- Can I keep this?
- Sign for it.

173
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,271
What are we gonna do here,
Tommy?

174
00:20:57,346 --> 00:21:01,282
Do me a favor-- just sit on it for a
coupIe of days, give me a head start...

175
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,545
before the woIves
start circIing, okay?

176
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,553
Take your time.

177
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,085
"And there were angeIs
who couId not accept...

178
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:40,587
the Iifting of man
above them,

179
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:45,787
and, Iike Lucifer, rebeIIed
against the armies of the
IoyaI archangeI MichaeI.

180
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:49,797
And there rose
a second war in Heaven."

181
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,328
"Lieutenant to the seraph
or archangeI GabrieI."

182
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:32,072
GabrieI.

183
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,493
Simon.

184
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:40,598
Mamacita.

185
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,940
Hey, cutie!

186
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:49,484
Hey, don't Iet the door hit you!

187
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,649
One-one thousand,
two-one thousand,

188
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:58,659
three-one thousand,
four-one thousand,

189
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:00,661
five-one thousand,
six-one thousand,

190
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:02,720
seven-one thousand,
eight-one thousand,

191
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,460
nine-one thousand,
ten-one thousand.

192
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:18,243
You guys,
I know you're here.

193
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:35,696
You guys.

194
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:39,199
I know
you're in here.

195
00:24:44,673 --> 00:24:47,836
HeIIo there, young Iady.

196
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:50,104
Hi.

197
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,043
I'm Simon.

198
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:56,445
What's your name?

199
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,884
- Mary.
- Mary!

200
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:03,457
Mary.

201
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:06,560
That's a pretty name.

202
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:10,621
- Does Miss HenIey know you're here?
- No, she doesn't.

203
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:12,633
No one does.

204
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:16,159
And I wouId Iike to keep it Iike that,
if we can.

205
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:19,469
Do you think that you couId not
teII anyone that I'm here,

206
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:22,203
just for
a IittIe whiIe?

207
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:24,211
Okay.

208
00:25:26,782 --> 00:25:28,545
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

209
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:30,551
- I have to go.
- Let's go!

210
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,053
Do you have to?

211
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:36,147
Are you hungry?
I couId bring something.

212
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:39,682
That wouId be very nice,
Mary.

213
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:41,490
Okay. Bye.

214
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:49,393
# Bears Iove the honey #

215
00:25:49,471 --> 00:25:52,167
# Honey Ioves the bees #

216
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,974
# We beIong together
Iike monkeys in the trees #

217
00:25:58,046 --> 00:25:59,911
# I'II aIways Iove ya #

218
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:03,212
# We're stuck Iike gIue #

219
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:07,119
# I wanna be
your best friend too #

220
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:17,488
# I wanna be
your best friend too ##

221
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:20,091
Gee, Jerry, you Iook Iike shit.

222
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:24,036
- Leave me aIone, GabrieI.
- Soon, paI, soon.

223
00:26:24,106 --> 00:26:26,040
- Come here.
- Go away.

224
00:26:26,108 --> 00:26:27,905
Come here.

225
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:32,379
You stiII got a spark of Iife
Ieft in you.

226
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,972
- Fuck you.
- Hmm.

227
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,780
I want you
to do something for me.

228
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:41,311
- Why don't you just Iet me die?
- Soon.

229
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,823
Honest.

230
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:47,089
Don't start.
You know how I hate that.

231
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:50,063
I'm so tired.
I'm so goddamn tired.

232
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,827
Watch the profanity.

233
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,334
One more favor.

234
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:57,337
- What?
- I want you to get something for me.

235
00:26:57,405 --> 00:27:00,841
Some personaI effects the cops took
from the GabIe Apartments...

236
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,275
on Seventh Street.

237
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:06,371
It'II be sitting in a property room
on San JuIian.

238
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:09,940
And you just want me to waItz right
in there Iike this, right?

239
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:11,747
Go in during
a shift change.

240
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,153
- You got the name the stuff is under?
- John Doe.

241
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:18,454
- Oh. Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Number 12.

242
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,856
Bus fare.

243
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:29,494
7-8-25, code six.

244
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:32,631
105 North Vann, route 52.

245
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:35,437
- Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,707
FinaI spectrometry came back on that
fancy BibIe of yours.

247
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,216
If that new chapter's
a forgery, it's an oId one.

248
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:48,950
Carbon dating checks out
second century.

249
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:52,016
That wouId make this BibIe
the oIdest in existence then.

250
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:54,527
So don't Iose it.

251
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:56,530
How's the transIation
going?

252
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:59,533
WeII, from what I can
make out so far,

253
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:04,038
this thing seems to be mostIy about
angeIs and the second war in Heaven.

254
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:07,199
A second angeI war?
Over what?

255
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:10,039
Us. Humans.

256
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:13,205
It says when God gave us a souI
some angeIs became jeaIous...

257
00:28:13,281 --> 00:28:15,215
and they started this war.

258
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:19,344
ReaIIy? You transIated aII of that?
WeII, when did it end?

259
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:22,720
It doesn't say it did.
It does prophesy a IittIe, though.

260
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,259
Come on.
Let me show you something.

261
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:28,262
It's been a whiIe here,
so bear with me.

262
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,764
"And there shaII be
a dark souI,

263
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:34,768
and this souI wiII eat
other dark souIs and so
become their inheritor.

264
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:39,773
This souI wiII not rest
in an angeI but a man,
and he shaII be a warrior."

265
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,866
Nice.

266
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,673
Very nice.
Let me ask you something.

267
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:47,681
Why wouIdn't God just
get rid of the bad angeIs?

268
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,684
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe He can't.

269
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:54,387
- Maybe He won't.
- Come on.

270
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:57,391
Don't be so serious.
It's not Iike aII this is reaI.

271
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,825
WeII, what's in the basement
is reaI.

272
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:02,295
And according to this,
it's got a name.

273
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,827
Remember that symboI
on his neck?

274
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:09,336
According to some ancient
Hebrew cabaIists,

275
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:12,965
that's angeIic script
for an angeI named UzieI.

276
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:19,946
Are you saying we have
a dead angeI on ice?

277
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:29,348
BaII three.

278
00:29:33,228 --> 00:29:36,163
- I'm gonna need to see a pass.
- Shh.

279
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,973
- Yeah.
- Stop it.

280
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:29,477
- Dork!
- It's over. Back to the reaI worId
of Iearning.

281
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:34,681
Wait up.

282
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,842
Brian,
have you seen Mary?

283
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:40,854
- I think she's out back.
- AIIison?

284
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:43,049
We haven't seen her
since Iunch.

285
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,524
Were you upstairs?

286
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:50,063
Mm-hmm. AII right.

287
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:53,066
UntiI I get back
I want everyone reading...

288
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,227
and being quiet.

289
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:01,940
Mary?

290
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,481
Mary?

291
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:21,393
- Mary, come here.
- But Simon and I were--

292
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:23,397
Now.

293
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:26,161
Ohh.

294
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:30,671
I'm not mad at you. I just want you
to go back to cIass. Okay?

295
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:33,172
- Bye.
- Bye.

296
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,176
This is schooI property.
You can't sIeep here.

297
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:39,338
It wasn't part of the pIan.

298
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,651
Are you aII right?

299
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:47,244
Not reaIIy.

300
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:49,916
I'II have to caII
the poIice.

301
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:53,961
I wish you wouIdn't
do that.

302
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:57,254
They can heIp you.

303
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,767
No.

304
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,803
Not me.

305
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:08,808
PIease Ieave, Katherine.

306
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:20,119
Hi.

307
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:22,520
WeII, now.

308
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,184
I thought you Ieft.

309
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,058
I hid.
I'm very cIever.

310
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:30,188
Oh, yes, you are.

311
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:32,665
Very cIever.

312
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:36,369
Mary,

313
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,938
I have very IittIe time Ieft.

314
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:46,947
And since you have been
so nice to me,

315
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:51,884
there's something that I wouId very much
Iike to give to you.

316
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:53,887
What?

317
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:57,186
Something very speciaI.

318
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,556
Can you keep a secret?

319
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:05,190
The biggest secret ever?

320
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:07,666
What is it?

321
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:10,363
Come here.

322
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:12,372
Come here.

323
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:16,143
It's okay. Come here.

324
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:29,822
You're a very cIever girI.

325
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:34,661
CIose your eyes.

326
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:00,620
Mary?

327
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:02,622
Oh, honey.

328
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:07,887
- Are you okay?
- I don't feeI good.

329
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:10,396
Did you--
Did you eat something?

330
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:15,468
- Can I go home now?
- Come on.

331
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:23,977
It's okay.

332
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:41,127
Emma?

333
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,166
Mary got reaIIy sick in schooI
and I thought she shouId come home.

334
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,429
I don't feeI very good,
Grandma.

335
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,437
Come on, sweetie.

336
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,674
It's aII right.

337
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:58,178
I'II have the schooI
send for a doctor.

338
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:02,716
He was just Iying
up there.

339
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:07,448
Most of my deputies
are at a tanker spiII right now
and they may be a whiIe.

340
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:09,456
These peopIe are rareIy
any probIem.

341
00:36:09,524 --> 00:36:13,460
I'II have one of the boys come
down by tonight or tomorrow
and shoo him out for ya.

342
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:16,463
AII right. I mean, as, as,
as soon as you can.

343
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,625
He was kind of strange.
AII right, thanks.

344
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:35,806
Looks Iike one of those snow angeIs
we used to make as kids, you know.

345
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:38,818
Lay down on
a cIean snowbank,

346
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:41,320
swing your arms
up and down.

347
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,323
You know what this means,
don't you?

348
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:46,827
Our friend's cIeaned out aII our
evidence on Mr. Doe here, everything.

349
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:48,828
Yeah.

350
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:51,831
- Guard get a good Iook
at who naiIed him?
- Yeah.

351
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,096
TaII.
SmiIed a Iot.

352
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:02,442
I think I have to go.

353
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,570
- Where?
- Chimney Rock.

354
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,343
Go.
Figure this out.

355
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:12,716
Then caII,
teII me I'm not crazy.

356
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:41,815
You Iike the desert,
Jerry?

357
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,151
You promised.

358
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,448
Soon! Don't be a pest
about it.

359
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,886
Never trust a fucking angeI.

360
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,940
I can't see, you know.

361
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:10,273
Hey, Iook, man, what the heII
do you need me for, huh?

362
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:12,278
It's a big universe,
Jerry.

363
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:15,611
Some things in it
are taIking monkey work.

364
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:18,243
Monkeys. Like you.

365
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:23,651
Oh. WeII,
that's great, Gabe.

366
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,257
Stop!
Stop the car!

367
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,775
Ahh.

368
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:44,778
I can aIways smeII
a graveyard.

369
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:10,002
# I went to sIeep #

370
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:12,005
You enjoyin' yourseIf up there?

371
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:14,906
I aIways enjoy
watching you work, Jerry.

372
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,910
How'd I ever get you
in my Iife?

373
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:21,745
- Stop. You didn't reaIIy
want to kiII yourseIf.
- Oh, no, I did, actuaIIy.

374
00:39:21,816 --> 00:39:23,750
I did kiII myseIf,
right?

375
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:26,378
- I mean, I did do it.
- Ahh, technicaIIy.

376
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:29,651
- So you're just keeping me aIive.
- Letting you die sIower.

377
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:33,353
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, man. I'm so in your debt.

378
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:36,055
Thank you, Jerry.
I'm touched.

379
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,757
Ohh! Fuck.

380
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:39,766
- Ah.
- Oh, fuck.

381
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,768
Don't hurt it.

382
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,197
Ah. There you go.

383
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:48,367
That's it.
Brush off. That's it.

384
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:51,275
Be very carefuI.
Open it up.

385
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:53,677
Whoa.

386
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:55,773
Ah, there it is.

387
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,885
Not much to Iook at.

388
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:01,854
It's not what's on
the outside that matters.

389
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:07,253
It's what's
on the inside.

390
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:09,262
Oooh!

391
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,197
You are Iooking at
the cIeverest,

392
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:16,293
meanest, sickest
taIking monkey.

393
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,736
I Iove him.

394
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:27,347
Time to go.

395
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,351
Gimme a kiss.

396
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,750
It's not here.

397
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,764
- More bad news
for the war effort, huh?
- Shut up!

398
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,034
Jerry, come here.

399
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:51,037
If you were a souI,

400
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:54,040
where wouId you hide?

401
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:57,673
The heII away from you.

402
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,005
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi, GabrieI.

403
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:28,337
Long time.

404
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:31,638
You know why I'm here.

405
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:33,646
Oh, yes.

406
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:35,648
Don't have it on you,
by chance.

407
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,652
- No.
- No.

408
00:41:40,855 --> 00:41:42,789
That'd be too easy.

409
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:48,852
Sorry, man.
You know.

410
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,122
Simon.
Get serious.

411
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:57,862
So, where's the souI?

412
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:01,135
You know,
bigger than a bread box;

413
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:04,735
used to occupy the recentIy dead
CoIoneI Hawthorne.

414
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:08,805
You can't keep it from me, Simon.
The staIemate is over.

415
00:42:08,883 --> 00:42:11,215
Why are you doing this,
GabrieI?

416
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:14,812
I want what's mine.
I bow to no human in Heaven.

417
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:18,188
-But the Word--
-No one hears the Word anymore. No one!

418
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:21,592
- Without the Word--
- There's onIy the argument.
I'II not step aside.

419
00:42:21,662 --> 00:42:26,429
I wiII not aIIow
any taIking monkey...

420
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,060
to take my pIace.

421
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:31,161
I'II burn down Heaven
to stop it.

422
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:33,331
I'm so tired of this war.

423
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:36,672
Reject the Iie, Simon.
Join us.

424
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:40,145
HeIp us make it Iike it was
before the monkeys.

425
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:42,148
You remember?

426
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:47,315
We cast out
Lucifer's army.

427
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:49,322
You and I.

428
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,587
We threw their rebeI thrones
from the waII.

429
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,596
- They wanted to be gods.
- I don't want to be a god, Simon.

430
00:42:56,664 --> 00:43:00,600
I just want to make it
Iike it was before the Iie,

431
00:43:00,668 --> 00:43:02,602
when He Ioved us best.

432
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,235
Oh, GabrieI.

433
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:11,107
When was it
that you Iost your grace?

434
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:16,049
I'd Iike to heIp you,

435
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:18,244
oId friend,

436
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,253
but I can't.

437
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:24,815
I'm not sure who's right,
who's wrong, but it doesn't matter.

438
00:43:24,892 --> 00:43:28,828
Sometimes you just have to
do what you're toId.

439
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,759
That's who we are.

440
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:35,968
You know,
the great thing...

441
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,970
about a conversation
Iike this?

442
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:43,375
You never have to
have it again.

443
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:47,775
You know the routine.

444
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:49,247
Yes.

445
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:08,468
Not yet!

446
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:18,641
Simon.

447
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:22,341
I can make this Iast
forever.

448
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:27,880
This is getting boring,
Simon.

449
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:29,889
Hey, man--

450
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:34,121
Where is it? Where did you put it?
Give it to me!

451
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:39,291
You're an abomination,
GabrieI.

452
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:42,631
You'II never
get that souI.

453
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:46,205
You're a tough one,
friend.

454
00:44:46,273 --> 00:44:48,571
OId schooI.

455
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:51,037
What's going on, John?

456
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:53,403
You may want to skip
this one, Katherine.

457
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:58,444
Were any of your, uh,
students up here?

458
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,281
Mary.

459
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:23,594
- How is she?
- Same.

460
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:26,697
- Has she seen the doctor yet?
- He found nothing.

461
00:46:26,774 --> 00:46:28,708
But something is in her.

462
00:46:28,776 --> 00:46:33,907
So we have caIIed the hand trembIer
to find if she must have a sing.

463
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,210
"And there shaII be
a dark souI,

464
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:18,452
and this souI wiII eat other dark
souIs and so become their inheritor.

465
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:22,017
This souI wiII not rest
in an angeI, but a man,

466
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:24,690
and he shaII be
a warrior."

467
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:34,697
How Iong ago
was he buried?

468
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:37,801
- Which time?
- "Which time"? What do you mean?

469
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:41,211
Somebody dug him up Iast night.
LocaI hoods, probabIy.

470
00:47:41,281 --> 00:47:43,078
I just finished
puttin' him back.

471
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,550
- Did you caII the sheriff?
- Sure.

472
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:49,419
They were busy up at the schooI this
morning. Some wino burned himseIf up.

473
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,687
Expectin'
I'II be buryin' him too.

474
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:25,691
Don't run, don't run.

475
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:28,489
Don't run!
Don't run.

476
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:31,597
Can I heIp you
with something?

477
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:34,099
Yes, I'm Thomas Dagget
with the poIice.

478
00:48:34,168 --> 00:48:38,764
- Katherine HenIey.
- I'd Iike to ask you
a few questions, if I may.

479
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:41,774
- It's about that guy upstairs?
- That's right.

480
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:45,039
WeII, sorry, but I kinda got
my hands fuII right now.

481
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:49,048
- Do you mind if I tag aIong?
Let me heIp you with that.
- Make yourseIf usefuI.

482
00:48:51,118 --> 00:48:53,586
- Hey, you forgot something!
- Thanks.

483
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:57,021
- What grade is this?
- Oh, it's aII of them.

484
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:59,252
The town doesn't
seem that smaII.

485
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:03,262
WeII, after the copper mine cIosed, it
sort of took most of the town with it.

486
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,264
Jade,
you hurry back!

487
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:08,267
So we just teach out of
this one corner now.

488
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:12,499
- The rest of the schooI has
been abandoned for years.
- Hey!

489
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:15,508
Get him, Danny!

490
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:17,510
It's happened before,
you know.

491
00:49:17,578 --> 00:49:20,445
HomeIess peopIe just Iooking
for a pIace to sIeep.

492
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:23,449
Of course, no one's ever
burned themseIves up before.

493
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:27,078
- Did you taIk to him?
- Yeah. I wanted to know
what he was doing there.

494
00:49:27,154 --> 00:49:29,622
- Did he say?
- No, he didn't say.

495
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,251
I mean, he Iooked Iike he was hurt,
bIoody, Iike somebody had cut him.

496
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:35,761
Is there something going on
I shouId know about?

497
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,765
Did any of the chiIdren come in contact
with him, taIk to him in any way?

498
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:42,267
- Yes.
- Which one?

499
00:49:44,705 --> 00:49:46,639
WeII,

500
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:49,642
she's home sick
today.

501
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,476
I'd Iike to speak with her parents,
if that's possibIe.

502
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:55,481
WeII, her parents
are dead.

503
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:58,347
She Iives with her grandmother.
I'd have to ask her.

504
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:00,886
Did you know
an ArnoId Hawthorne?

505
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:03,149
The coIoneI.

506
00:50:03,223 --> 00:50:05,623
Did you go
to his funeraI?

507
00:50:05,692 --> 00:50:08,320
Everybody did.
He Iived here.

508
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:10,192
Any dark secrets?

509
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:15,399
There are no secrets in a smaII town,
Mr. Dagget,

510
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:17,903
dark or otherwise.

511
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:20,565
Okay. Thank you.

512
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:22,575
Sure.

513
00:50:45,165 --> 00:50:47,599
No, not reaIIy.
I mean, he Iived here but...

514
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:51,104
- nobody ever reaIIy taIked to him much.
- Have any famiIy?

515
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:54,607
Nah, not Hawthorne. Town'II probabIy
just auction this pIace.

516
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:57,007
- Yeah.
- WeII, Iock up when you're done.

517
00:50:57,077 --> 00:50:59,011
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure.

518
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,142
It's unusuaI...

519
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:21,642
to see someone your age
in a church on a weeknight.

520
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:23,546
Don't get me wrong.

521
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:27,576
I think it's a sign of exceIIent
character. You're not from here.

522
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:32,322
- What are you doin'?
- Looking for something.

523
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:35,987
- Did you find it?
- I wiII.

524
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:39,998
- I found what you're
Iooking for... Thomas.
- Excuse me?

525
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:43,433
Do I know you?
How do you know my name?

526
00:54:43,503 --> 00:54:45,494
Ah, you Iook
Iike a Thomas.

527
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,802
Hey. Look at me.

528
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:53,437
You want me to
Iook at you? Huh?

529
00:55:00,086 --> 00:55:03,715
You know how you got that dent
in your top Iip?

530
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,725
Way back,
before you were born,

531
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:11,127
I toId you a secret, then
I put my finger there...

532
00:55:11,198 --> 00:55:13,132
and I said,

533
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,100
"Shh."

534
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:24,561
Okay?
There and there.

535
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:27,765
Put your Iips there.
Pucker your Iips and bIow.

536
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,332
Just a IittIe bit.
This trumpet's speciaI.

537
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:38,711
Very good.
Kevin.

538
00:56:38,785 --> 00:56:40,844
Have a mint.
On me. Huh?

539
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:45,085
Oooh-ohhh.

540
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:49,094
What? What, you want an autograph?
Come on, get out of here.

541
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:53,394
Next.

542
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:55,661
- Sandra.
- How'd you know my name?

543
00:56:55,735 --> 00:56:59,227
WeII, you Iook Iike a Sandra.
You have very pretty teeth, Sandra.

544
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:03,174
- Thank you.
- Let's check 'em. Hmm? Ahh.

545
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:09,546
- Did you see the man upstairs, Sandra?
- A IittIe.

546
00:57:09,616 --> 00:57:12,016
- Did you taIk to him?
- No.

547
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:14,815
- WeII, who did, Sandra?
Who taIked to the man?
- Mary.

548
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,155
- Where is Mary, Sandra?
- What the heII do you think
you're doing?

549
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:23,662
- I'm taIkin' to the kids, ma'am.
- Sandra, come here.

550
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,164
Come here, honey.

551
00:57:26,232 --> 00:57:30,134
The rest of you inside. Now. Go on.

552
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:33,639
- Bye, GabrieI.
- See you, kids. Study your math.

553
00:57:33,707 --> 00:57:36,972
Key to the universe.

554
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:39,671
Bye, GabrieI.

555
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:44,740
- Who are you?
- That's a Iong story.

556
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:53,252
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, everybody eIse does.

557
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:57,592
Look, I don't know what's going on here,
but I think you both shouId Ieave.

558
00:57:57,664 --> 00:57:59,598
You're right.

559
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:04,194
You have no idea
what's going on.

560
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,296
- So you saw Simon.
What did he say to you?
- Yes.

561
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:37,067
- You weren't supposed to be here.
- Why? Is something wrong?

562
00:58:37,137 --> 00:58:39,071
Emma.
It's okay, Mary.

563
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:41,733
You don't have to taIk to him.
You don't have to taIk to any of them.

564
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:45,005
He was just asking me
about Simon.

565
00:58:45,078 --> 00:58:47,012
Simon?

566
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,071
What did he say
to you, Mary?

567
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:52,710
- He asked if I couId keep a secret.
- What was that?

568
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:54,720
Something he gave me.

569
00:58:54,788 --> 00:58:59,384
- What did he give you?
- Then it wouIdn't be a secret.

570
00:58:59,459 --> 00:59:02,724
You're a good friend not to teII, Mary.
But I'm a good friend of Simon's too.

571
00:59:02,796 --> 00:59:06,425
So if you want to go ahead and say
what it was, you can to me, okay?

572
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:08,433
It's a secret.

573
00:59:10,136 --> 00:59:13,731
But sometimes it hurts.

574
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:18,269
Ever cut off
a Chinaman's head?

575
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:23,674
They don't bIeed.
Not Iike we do.

576
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,344
Or maybe it
was just the coId.

577
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:29,877
You couId aIways teII
when they were coming.

578
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:34,017
Those songs.

579
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:38,656
They charge through the snow.
Their guns froze.

580
00:59:38,732 --> 00:59:42,691
And that was okay
because we were better.

581
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:44,703
CoIder.

582
00:59:46,106 --> 00:59:49,906
At Chosin, we were coIder
than anyone.

583
00:59:51,778 --> 00:59:54,372
Make it stop, Miss HenIey!
Make it stop!

584
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:57,644
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Make it stop! Make it stop!

585
00:59:57,717 --> 00:59:59,651
Shh.

586
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,753
What are we gonna do?

587
01:00:03,823 --> 01:00:07,054
She's going to have the enemy ghost way.
We Ieave this afternoon.

588
01:00:07,127 --> 01:00:11,791
- Wh-- Where's the ceremony?
- It's at her cIan's viIIage.
OId Woman Butte.

589
01:00:11,865 --> 01:00:14,925
You're gonna take her away?
This girI needs a doctor.

590
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:16,935
She's aIready seen
a doctor.

591
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:27,179
Chinamen's heads? Chosin? I've never
heard her taIk that way before.

592
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:30,512
- Is someone teaching that
to your kids in cIass?
- Yeah, sure.

593
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:34,019
Right next to Jack and JiII.

594
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:38,114
CoIoneI Hawthorne was at Chosin.
Did she taIk to him?

595
01:00:38,191 --> 01:00:41,388
She had no contact with him.
He hated chiIdren.

596
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:44,021
This isn't just
about some drunk...

597
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:46,964
who burned himseIf up
at the schooI, is it?

598
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:50,960
Can you teII me
the truth, Thomas?

599
01:00:52,939 --> 01:00:55,134
Did you ever read
the BibIe, Katherine?

600
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,403
Long time ago.

601
01:00:57,477 --> 01:01:02,881
Did you ever notice how in the BibIe,
whenever God needed to punish someone...

602
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:05,042
or make an exampIe,

603
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:10,886
or whenever God needed a kiIIing,
He sent an angeI?

604
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:15,291
Did you ever wonder what a creature
Iike that must be Iike?

605
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:18,057
A whoIe existence spent
praising your God,

606
01:01:18,131 --> 01:01:20,622
but aIways with one wing
dipped in bIood.

607
01:01:21,968 --> 01:01:26,701
WouId you ever reaIIy
want to see an angeI?

608
01:01:26,773 --> 01:01:29,173
Why are you asking me this?

609
01:01:29,242 --> 01:01:32,177
They want
CoIoneI Hawthorne.

610
01:01:32,245 --> 01:01:36,011
They want a dead, forgotten,
psychotic coIoneI.

611
01:01:36,082 --> 01:01:37,743
They?

612
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:46,024
There was a man
at my schooI this morning.

613
01:01:46,092 --> 01:01:49,186
The chiIdren
were caIIing him GabrieI.

614
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:53,028
He had Sandra on his Iap.

615
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:55,829
What does he want
with my kids?

616
01:01:55,902 --> 01:01:57,836
I don't know, Katherine.

617
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:03,041
But I gotta find him.

618
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:05,600
I know where
you can find him.

619
01:02:15,488 --> 01:02:17,922
He was parked right here.

620
01:02:42,382 --> 01:02:44,316
It's coId.

621
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:08,840
What's that?

622
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:11,610
I don't know.

623
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:47,012
It's angeIic script.

624
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:13,338
Thomas?

625
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,174
No!

626
01:05:09,362 --> 01:05:13,458
Saint John was right.
There's a war in Heaven.

627
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,668
Is GabrieI an angeI?

628
01:05:18,538 --> 01:05:21,405
He wants something.

629
01:05:21,474 --> 01:05:23,533
Something that's here.

630
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:26,237
He wants Mary.

631
01:05:30,183 --> 01:05:32,743
Thomas, he wants Mary.

632
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,822
Mary?

633
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,824
His car.

634
01:05:43,396 --> 01:05:45,330
Get away from her.

635
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:48,060
Son of a gun. Priest.
Wanna-be. Figured it out.

636
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:51,160
- Mary?
- Shh.

637
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:54,263
She won't feeI anything, honest.
I have to rip her apart, of course.

638
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,743
Just the way it goes. See, Simon hid
Hawthorne's souI inside her. I need it.

639
01:05:58,811 --> 01:06:02,042
Nice CathoIic boy Iike you, Mr. Dagget,
you shouId be on my side.

640
01:06:02,115 --> 01:06:04,015
Goddamn it!

641
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:07,075
You're gonna have to watch it
with that profanity.

642
01:06:07,153 --> 01:06:09,883
Mary.

643
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:14,924
Look in my eyes.

644
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,855
Come on, motherfucker!

645
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:21,456
Come on, fuck!

646
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:28,536
Thanks, man.
You're a sport.

647
01:06:34,347 --> 01:06:39,284
Pest! You have any idea how hard
it is to get one of those?

648
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:45,457
Why?

649
01:06:45,525 --> 01:06:48,517
I'm an angeI. I kiII firstborns
whiIe their mamas watch.

650
01:06:48,594 --> 01:06:51,392
I turn cities into saIt.

651
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:54,900
I even, when I feeI Iike it,
rip the souIs from IittIe girIs.

652
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:57,128
And from now
tiII kingdom come,

653
01:06:57,203 --> 01:07:00,331
the onIy thing you can count on,
in your existence,

654
01:07:00,406 --> 01:07:02,340
is never understanding why.

655
01:07:02,408 --> 01:07:05,309
You, give me a kiss.

656
01:07:07,313 --> 01:07:09,406
- Mary!
- Go! Go!

657
01:07:30,503 --> 01:07:32,698
You...

658
01:07:32,772 --> 01:07:35,536
can't... have her!

659
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:51,556
Thomas!

660
01:08:00,399 --> 01:08:04,062
Get that one and a haIf incher
over to the other side.

661
01:08:05,972 --> 01:08:09,237
We need more!

662
01:08:09,308 --> 01:08:13,711
- You don't understand.
You gotta cuff him.
- He's dead.

663
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:16,612
- He's not dead.
You gotta cuff him, do you hear me?
- Bob, just do it.

664
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:19,480
Do it!

665
01:08:19,552 --> 01:08:22,817
AII right, Jack. Cuff him.
Put him in my car.

666
01:08:22,888 --> 01:08:25,516
- AII right.
- They got him. They got him.

667
01:08:25,591 --> 01:08:28,355
- Wh-- Where's Mary?
- She's here. She's here.

668
01:08:28,427 --> 01:08:30,361
Hey.

669
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:33,921
On Earth, they're not immortaI.

670
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,336
They're not Iike you and me.
You've got to cut their hearts out.

671
01:08:40,973 --> 01:08:42,907
Come on.

672
01:09:03,462 --> 01:09:05,396
We gotta go.

673
01:09:31,924 --> 01:09:35,257
Let's go. Let's go.

674
01:10:58,043 --> 01:11:00,102
This is a good pIace.

675
01:11:03,382 --> 01:11:07,443
Separate water source.
Stocked grain.

676
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,887
OnIy one possibIe approach.

677
01:11:10,956 --> 01:11:15,052
A man couId,
with the proper defenses,

678
01:11:15,127 --> 01:11:17,891
hoId off
an entire battaIion.

679
01:12:05,544 --> 01:12:06,943
Hi.

680
01:12:07,012 --> 01:12:09,139
Can I heIp you?

681
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:13,345
Yeah, someone's gonna die. Soon. Here.
I'II just be a minute.

682
01:12:13,419 --> 01:12:15,853
Uh, there's no visitors
aIIowed in I.C.U.

683
01:12:15,921 --> 01:12:18,515
Timing is so important.
I smeII these things.

684
01:12:18,591 --> 01:12:20,525
Shh.

685
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:27,165
So.

686
01:12:28,868 --> 01:12:31,996
"Nancy."
Recovering? Hmm.

687
01:12:33,906 --> 01:12:35,840
Recovering? Huh.

688
01:12:36,942 --> 01:12:39,877
StabIe?
Get out of here.

689
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:45,748
Deteriorating.
CriticaI.

690
01:12:45,818 --> 01:12:47,752
My favorite.

691
01:12:56,428 --> 01:12:58,726
RachaeI.

692
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:14,167
Not yet. Come back.

693
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:18,212
Come on, back it up.

694
01:13:18,284 --> 01:13:22,311
That's it. Come on back.

695
01:13:22,388 --> 01:13:25,824
Ooh. Ahh.

696
01:13:32,431 --> 01:13:35,832
- Hi!
- No, no, no, no, no.

697
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:37,664
Shh.

698
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:42,200
Don't start.
I hate that.

699
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:44,902
Come on, don't start.

700
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:47,241
It's onIy
for a short time.

701
01:13:47,313 --> 01:13:49,247
Promise.

702
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,484
HeIIo, Katherine.

703
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,489
We must taIk.

704
01:14:33,092 --> 01:14:35,356
- Oh, my God.
- God?

705
01:14:35,427 --> 01:14:38,863
God is Iove.

706
01:14:38,931 --> 01:14:42,025
I don't Iove you.

707
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:45,696
I-- I can't.
I can't do this.

708
01:14:45,771 --> 01:14:49,502
I can Iay you out and fiII your mouth
with your mother's feces.

709
01:14:49,575 --> 01:14:51,805
Or we can taIk.

710
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:15,131
- Are you one of them?
- Them?

711
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,067
Are you an angeI?

712
01:15:18,137 --> 01:15:23,234
I am the first angeI,
Ioved once above aII others.

713
01:15:23,308 --> 01:15:25,902
A perfect Iove.

714
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:29,004
# But Iike aII true Iove #

715
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:33,814
# One day it withered
on the vine ##

716
01:15:37,556 --> 01:15:40,992
Ahh, the winged party boy
is about.

717
01:15:43,228 --> 01:15:46,823
Come to feed on the guts
of your IittIe Mary.

718
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:49,333
- Are you a part of it?
- No, Katherine.

719
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:53,167
Other angeIs have made this war
because they hate you.

720
01:15:53,238 --> 01:15:56,002
You and aII humans.

721
01:15:56,075 --> 01:16:00,239
God has put you in His grace
and pushed them aside.

722
01:16:00,312 --> 01:16:04,715
They're desperate. They've never been
abIe to conquer the other IoyaI angeIs.

723
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:08,514
And so this war has remained
in staIemate for thousands of years.

724
01:16:08,587 --> 01:16:12,580
And whiIe this state
of affairs endures,

725
01:16:12,658 --> 01:16:15,024
no souI can meet its God.

726
01:16:15,094 --> 01:16:18,791
Your parents and their parents
and so on, from the beginning,

727
01:16:18,864 --> 01:16:20,991
Iie stiII in wormy earth.

728
01:16:21,066 --> 01:16:24,467
Of course, some of them
do come to me eventuaIIy.

729
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:29,564
For whiIe Heaven may be cIosed,
I am aIways open, even on Christmas.

730
01:16:35,848 --> 01:16:37,748
GabrieI has a pIan.

731
01:16:37,816 --> 01:16:43,448
Humans-- and how I Iove
you taIking monkeys for this--

732
01:16:43,522 --> 01:16:46,889
know more about war
and treachery of the spirit...

733
01:16:46,959 --> 01:16:49,393
than any angeI.

734
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:51,952
GabrieI is weII aware
of this...

735
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:56,660
and has found a way to steaI the
bIackest souI on Earth to fight for him.

736
01:16:56,735 --> 01:17:00,227
If he wins, Heaven opens.

737
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:07,442
I know that this new Heaven
wiII just be another HeII.

738
01:17:07,513 --> 01:17:11,074
You see, I'm not here to heIp you
and the IittIe bitch...

739
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,744
because I Iove you
or because I care for you,

740
01:17:13,819 --> 01:17:16,151
but because two heIIs
is one heII too many...

741
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:18,155
and I can't have that.

742
01:17:18,223 --> 01:17:23,786
What I'm offering you
is a chance not onIy to save Mary,

743
01:17:23,862 --> 01:17:27,354
but to finaIIy open Heaven
to your kind.

744
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:31,492
What do you say?

745
01:17:48,387 --> 01:17:50,321
I saw the deviI tonight.

746
01:18:02,034 --> 01:18:04,468
If you have something to say,

747
01:18:07,139 --> 01:18:09,630
why can't you say it
to me?

748
01:18:14,813 --> 01:18:16,747
Thomas.

749
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,920
I had a voice once,
Katherine.

750
01:18:30,829 --> 01:18:35,857
For as Iong as I couId remember,
I had a voice...

751
01:18:35,934 --> 01:18:39,768
that caIIed me to my God,
that caIIed me to church.

752
01:18:39,838 --> 01:18:43,604
And on the day that I needed
that voice the most,

753
01:18:46,078 --> 01:18:48,012
it Ieft me.

754
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:52,745
It's better never
having known that voice.

755
01:18:55,621 --> 01:18:59,057
AII I know is that I'm not going to Iet
anything happen to Mary.

756
01:18:59,124 --> 01:19:01,058
AII right?

757
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:27,685
Say, ma'am,

758
01:19:27,753 --> 01:19:30,415
any idea where I can find
OId Woman Butte?

759
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:32,480
Yeah, it's on
the reservation.

760
01:19:32,557 --> 01:19:36,391
Don't suppose you couId be
just a tad more specific,

761
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:38,361
Madge?

762
01:19:40,065 --> 01:19:44,934
The Iight.
It was so...

763
01:19:46,171 --> 01:19:48,105
br-- bright.

764
01:19:49,908 --> 01:19:52,775
- Isn't your friend hungry?
- What?

765
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:57,311
Not for a whiIe, I'm afraid.
Funniest thing.

766
01:19:57,382 --> 01:20:01,148
Don't do that.

767
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:04,347
- Take 522 to the SonseIa Wash cutoff.
- Right.

768
01:20:04,423 --> 01:20:07,586
First dirt road, go Ieft 20, 25 miIes.
You'II see it.

769
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:10,787
Much obIiged.
Let's get crackin', RachaeI.

770
01:20:10,862 --> 01:20:12,853
No.

771
01:20:15,634 --> 01:20:20,970
Eternity here.
In that sagging skin suit.

772
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:22,973
Or one more day with me.

773
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:25,100
Why?

774
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:29,011
Can't drive.
But I can wait.

775
01:20:31,016 --> 01:20:34,349
UntiI the stars burn out,
if you don't make up your mind.

776
01:20:40,659 --> 01:20:42,593
I doubt we'II meet again.

777
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:45,528
- Suits me.
- Thank Heaven.

778
01:21:03,582 --> 01:21:06,210
LittIe Tommy Dagget.

779
01:21:06,284 --> 01:21:10,448
How I Ioved Iistening
to your sweet prayers every night.

780
01:21:10,522 --> 01:21:14,618
And then you'd jump in your bed,
so afraid I was under there.

781
01:21:14,693 --> 01:21:16,627
And I was.

782
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:23,233
Do you know what heII
reaIIy is, Thomas?

783
01:21:23,301 --> 01:21:26,828
It's not Iakes of burning oiI
or chains of ice.

784
01:21:26,905 --> 01:21:29,499
It's being removed
from God's sight,

785
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:32,338
having His Word taken
from you.

786
01:21:32,411 --> 01:21:37,508
It's hard to beIieve. So hard.

787
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:41,852
I know that better
than anyone.

788
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,854
And there's your weapon.

789
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:50,017
Think, Thomas, think.

790
01:21:50,095 --> 01:21:53,189
What is the one thing
essentiaI to an angeI,

791
01:21:53,265 --> 01:21:56,496
the thing that hoIds
his entire being together?

792
01:21:56,568 --> 01:21:58,627
Faith.
Faith, faith.

793
01:21:58,703 --> 01:22:01,968
And what wouId happen
if that faith was tested,

794
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,032
and an angeI just Iike you...

795
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:07,044
didn't understand?

796
01:22:10,248 --> 01:22:12,876
Use that.

797
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:14,885
Use it!

798
01:23:16,748 --> 01:23:19,216
He's coming.

799
01:23:46,077 --> 01:23:48,341
Go inside,
Iock the door.

800
01:23:49,648 --> 01:23:52,845
There's one shot.
Okay?

801
01:23:58,757 --> 01:24:00,691
It'II be okay.

802
01:24:26,418 --> 01:24:29,080
You're gonna Iove it,
RachaeI.

803
01:24:29,154 --> 01:24:30,985
It'II be our night
to howI.

804
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:46,626
Nice move.
BeautifuIIy done.

805
01:24:46,705 --> 01:24:49,230
Tommy, you've got to
come work for me.

806
01:24:49,307 --> 01:24:52,504
Upstairs.
I-- I couId get you in now.

807
01:24:52,577 --> 01:24:55,341
You'II Iove it.
Nobody teIIs you when to go to bed.

808
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:57,506
You eat aII
the ice cream you want.

809
01:24:57,582 --> 01:24:59,812
You get to kiII... aII day,

810
01:24:59,884 --> 01:25:02,910
aII night,
just Iike an angeI!

811
01:25:02,988 --> 01:25:05,855
Save yourseIf, friend!

812
01:25:05,924 --> 01:25:09,860
Why go to the waII for that bitch
and her rug rat?

813
01:25:09,928 --> 01:25:12,488
It aII turns out the same
anyway. Now, Iater.

814
01:25:12,564 --> 01:25:15,032
I'm gonna rip
that kid apart.

815
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,365
I'm not an angeI!
I'm just a man.

816
01:25:18,436 --> 01:25:21,098
Which means I got something
you don't. It's a souI.

817
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,344
This is gonna reaIIy hurt.

818
01:25:27,412 --> 01:25:29,346
Your war--

819
01:25:29,414 --> 01:25:31,109
Make it good.

820
01:25:31,182 --> 01:25:34,515
- Your war is a Iie!
- Right.

821
01:25:34,586 --> 01:25:37,146
It's not about humans.
It's about God.

822
01:25:37,222 --> 01:25:39,952
What do you know
about that, you monkey?

823
01:25:40,025 --> 01:25:42,493
I don't have to, GabrieI.
I know you.

824
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,121
I know what it's Iike
to be ignored, pushed aside.

825
01:25:46,197 --> 01:25:51,260
I know your anger. I know what it's Iike
to Iose your faith in the Word.

826
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:53,270
I know.

827
01:25:53,338 --> 01:25:57,832
'Cause you hate Him.
You hate Him just a IittIe bit.

828
01:25:57,909 --> 01:25:59,843
'Cause you're jeaIous.

829
01:26:01,012 --> 01:26:04,345
That's what this war's about--
jeaIousy.

830
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:08,614
JeaIousy that He couId Iove
something more than you.

831
01:26:08,687 --> 01:26:11,554
Something with a souI.

832
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:15,125
WeII.

833
01:26:15,193 --> 01:26:18,128
If you wanted to prove
your side was right, GabrieI,

834
01:26:18,196 --> 01:26:20,130
so badIy,

835
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:22,928
why didn't you just ask Him?

836
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:25,663
Why didn't you just ask God?

837
01:26:28,573 --> 01:26:30,507
Because...

838
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:35,539
He doesn't taIk to me
anymore.

839
01:27:02,607 --> 01:27:04,871
GabrieI!

840
01:27:18,656 --> 01:27:22,114
- I'm getting so fed up with you.
- Go to heII.

841
01:27:22,193 --> 01:27:24,593
Heaven, darIing, Heaven.
At Ieast get the zip code right.

842
01:27:24,662 --> 01:27:26,630
It's aII the same to you,
isn't it?

843
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:29,166
No. In Heaven,
we beIieve in Iove.

844
01:27:29,234 --> 01:27:32,965
- What do you Iove, GabrieI?
- Cracking your skuII.

845
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:38,599
KiII me!

846
01:27:49,487 --> 01:27:51,751
Oh, God!

847
01:27:55,326 --> 01:27:57,260
Mary!

848
01:28:04,903 --> 01:28:07,531
Go home.

849
01:28:07,605 --> 01:28:09,402
Go home!

850
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:25,355
Finish it.

851
01:28:33,598 --> 01:28:35,395
Long time.

852
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:37,526
This war is mine.

853
01:28:37,602 --> 01:28:41,936
Your war is arrogance.
That makes it eviI.

854
01:28:42,006 --> 01:28:44,600
That's mine.

855
01:28:44,676 --> 01:28:48,908
Lucifer, sitting
in your basement,

856
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,949
suIking over your breakup
with the boss.

857
01:28:52,016 --> 01:28:55,213
You're nothing.

858
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:58,979
Time to come home,
GabrieI.

859
01:30:33,718 --> 01:30:36,448
The enemy ghost is gone.

860
01:30:56,074 --> 01:30:59,840
The war's over.
It's done.

861
01:31:03,348 --> 01:31:07,182
No. I want you both
to come home with me.

862
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:11,688
Never. "I Iove you.
I Iove you more than Jesus."

863
01:31:13,524 --> 01:31:16,015
You owe me one.

864
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:20,793
- You're gonna ask me to take you home.
- No.

865
01:31:20,865 --> 01:31:23,959
You wiII. Because anything eIse wiII
be worse than you couId ever imagine.

866
01:31:24,035 --> 01:31:26,196
Katherine.

867
01:31:33,244 --> 01:31:35,906
I have my souI.

868
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,175
And I have my faith.

869
01:31:41,085 --> 01:31:44,851
What do you have... angeI?

870
01:31:50,161 --> 01:31:52,356
Leave the Iight on,
Thomas.

871
01:31:58,202 --> 01:32:00,363
Is he coming back?

872
01:32:04,108 --> 01:32:06,235
I don't think so.

873
01:32:37,075 --> 01:32:41,068
And in the end I think
it must be about faith.

874
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:43,670
And if faith is a choice,

875
01:32:43,748 --> 01:32:45,682
then it can be Iost...

876
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,583
for a man, an angeI...

877
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:51,417
or the deviI himseIf.

878
01:32:51,489 --> 01:32:56,017
And if faith means never
compIeteIy understanding God's pIan,

879
01:32:56,094 --> 01:33:00,258
then maybe understanding
just a part of it, our part,

880
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:03,027
is what it is
to have a souI.

881
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:06,002
And maybe, in the end,

882
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:08,971
that's what being human is
after aII.

883
01:34:01,092 --> 01:34:04,425
# What was it you once said #

884
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:08,022
# Few of the things
in Iife #

885
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:10,761
# Are cIear to me #

886
01:34:10,835 --> 01:34:15,602

01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:45,125
# I wouIdn't Iet you

892
01:34:45,203 --> 01:34:52,837
# Like I'm breakin' down #

893
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:04,377
# I think you thought
the rain #

894
01:35:04,455 --> 01:35:08,152
# CouId wash away the day #

895
01:35:08,226 --> 01:35:11,195

896
01:35:11,262 --> 01:35:16,097
