The circumstances of the Hammond

Murch lived near the place where she
died and he's a known sex offender.

He was. Was, past tense.

It might have helped if your men
had stopped harassing him.

It just didn't work out, Wendy.
Why can't we just leave it at that?

358
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,068
Well, because I don't
want to leave it at that.

00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,459
Is that true, Alex?

- You knew what?

377

- LOU: Well, it just figures.
- That I'd play favorites?

378
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,384
I'd take it easy on Alex because
he's my son? Well, you're right.

379

You have been nothing but a disgrace
to this school and this community.

You're suspended indefinitely.
Now get out.

take a look at you.

Dad is too. He's just
too strong to show it.

00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,717
You know, she would have
been a junior this year?

402
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,720
Would have been her first prom.
