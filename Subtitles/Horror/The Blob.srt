00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,549
Hey, call a shrink.
I'm a broken man.

336
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,094
You think this is a joke?

337
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,564
Turn him loose.

338
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,067
Herb, we got eyewitnesses
placing him at the scene of the crime.

339
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:38,736
No motive, no evidence.

340
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,739
He hasn't got
a drop of blood on him.

341
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,368
Hell, Flagg's a punk,
but he's no killer. I think it's a mistake.

342
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:49,914
Well, your objection is duly noted.
Now, turn him loose. We got work to do.

343
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,335
Go on.

344
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,051
[Handcuffs Click]
Take a hike.

345
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,565
Brian,
I need to talk to you.

346
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:25,325
Brian.
What the hell are you doin' here?

347
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,036
Look, I came down
to bail you out.

348
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:34,417
What do you think they are,
Neiman-Marcus? They don't take plastic.

349
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:37,754
Hey, I appreciate the thought.
Now, go home, okay?

350
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:41,507
I need to talk to you.

351
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,677
Hey, I'm sorry about your boyfriend.
I really am.

352
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:49,599
But I'm tired and hungry,
and I'm not in the mood for conversation. Okay?

353
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,737
George. Franny.
¿Qué pasa?

354
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:05,198
Hey, hotshot, we're closed.

355
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:08,659
Aw, come on, Fran.
I've been dumped on all day. Give me a break.

356
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,538
Oh, what's the matter, dear?
Tough day at the office?

357
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,874
[Scoffs]
Well, grill's shut down.

358
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,585
- How 'bout a sandwich?
- Beautiful.

359
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:33,267
Geez, you don't give up, do you?

360
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,354
I need your help.

361
00:38:36,438 --> 00:38:39,816
For three years in school
you haven't said shit to me.

362
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,444
Now all of a sudden, what...
you need my help, and we're best friends, right?

363
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,366
Nobody believes me
about what happened tonight.

364
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,203
- What did happen?
- You were there. You saw.

365
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:56,332
All I saw was an old man with a funky hand.
That's all I saw.

366
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,921
Thanks.
Can I get you somethin', hon?

367
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:03,464
No, thank you.

368
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:15,935
The thing on that man's hand
killed him, and then it killed Paul.

369
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:19,021
And whatever it is,
it's getting bigger.

370
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,816
Is that what you told the cops?

371
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:32,034
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

372
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,331
I know you're
the homecoming queen type and all, but, uh,

373
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,959
are you strung out
on somethin', or what?

374
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,419
[Chuckles]

375
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:44,547
[Scoffs]
You're just the same.

376
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,259
What are you talkin' about?

377
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:52,388
You act like you're different.
You put on this big show.

378
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:57,143
But you're just like
everybody else in this town. You're full of shit, Flagg!

379
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:59,145
Hey, wait a second.

380
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,983
Hey, calm down, all right?

381
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,027
I'm sorry, okay?

382
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,238
Come on, sit down.

00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,041
You okay, huh?

385
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,670
You want somethin' to eat?

386
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,965
Here. Go ahead.
It'll make you feel better.

387
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,301
[Scoffs]
Unbelievable.

388
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:37,808
No, it's just I've never heard
you say the word "shit" before. What was that like for you?

389
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,852
[Chuckles]
[Laughs]

390
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,949
We're comin' up empty here.
Do you want us to head into the foothills?

391
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,826
[Sheriff Over Radio]
Negative. No, I'd rather have you patrolling the streets.

392
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,121
We'll start all that at first light
when the state police come in.

393
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,874
Ten-four.
You look exhausted.

394
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,252
It's been a long night.
Thank you.

395
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,547
It's gonna be even longer.

396
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,841
That's the truth.

397
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,969
One deputy and six volunteers.

398
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,973
I feel like the one-legged man
in an ass-kicking contest.

399
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:22,311
Well, you're doing all you can, Herb.
This isn't your normal Friday night trouble.

400
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,022
Something wrong?
I'm, uh‒

401
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,568
I'm just worried
about a friend of mine.

402
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,279
I guess I'm worried
about everybody tonight.

403
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,912
- Dessert?
- Oh, Fran.

404
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,499
That sandwich busted me.
On the house. Last two pieces.

405
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,626
Eat up, or
I chuck it in the garbage.

I'll get that.

I'll get it!

Great. I killed

Let's get outta here.
The front door's locked.

458
00:49:56,659 --> 00:50:01,163
- What about Briggs?
- I can't raise anybody. All I'm getting is static.

[Ringing Continues]
Sheriff's Department. Please hold.

460
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:08,087
The last I heard from the deputy,
he was on his way up to Elkin's Grove.

461
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,673
Elkin's Grove.
That's where I found the old man.

Come on, let's go.

Yo, Briggs!
[Coyote Howling]

465
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:52,881
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

some bread crumbs.

I hear something.

Are you a resident
of Arborville, Meg? Yes, I am.

482
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,016
Have you experienced
any vomiting, nausea or diarrhea?

483
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,062
Hey, back off, huh?
Hey, pal, you wanna fill us in?

484
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,898
Who the hell
are you people? I'm Dr. Meddows.

485
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:35,776
We're a government-sanctioned
biological containment team.

486
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,986
"Biological containment"?

487
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,365
We're microbe hunters,
young lady. Flagg?

488
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:44,993
What are you doing here, boy?

489
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:49,915
The men from Glad here
are showing us how to keep our leftovers fresh.

490
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:53,752
These people are here on serious business.
They don't have time for your bullshit, understand?

491
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:56,838
Colonel, has the deputy
been briefed in detail? Yes, sir.

492
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,049
I'm just heading back to town now
to get things started.

00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:03,053
Splendid. Colonel Hargis
will arrange an escort.

494
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:05,973
What is going on over there?

495
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:09,017
That's the source of our worries‒

496
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,395
a troublesome souvenir
from space. What?

497
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,231
A meteorite.
Don't get too close.

498
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:16,775
There's danger
of contamination.

499
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,445
[Meg]
I don't understand. Let me tell you a story.

500
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,908
The dinosaurs ruled our planet
for millions of years,

501
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:29,037
and yet they died out
almost overnight.

502
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,081
Why?

503
00:53:31,165 --> 00:53:36,295
The evidence suggests
that a meteor fell to Earth bearing an alien bacteria.

504
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,298
Plague? Is that what
this whole thing is about?

505
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,300
Prevention.

506
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,511
And you think this meteor
brought some kind of a killer germ?

507
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:50,309
It's something I've expected
and prepared for all my life.

508
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,645
Well, your meteor
brought somethin', all right.

509
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:58,900
But if it's a germ,
it's the biggest son of a bitch you've ever seen.

510
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:10,454
[Small Engine Revving]
What's the matter?

511
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:13,915
Isn't it awfully late
to be trimming the hedges?

512
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,668
Maybe this guy's
a Peeping Tom or something.

513
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,671
So let's give him
something to peep at.

Watch this.

517
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,398
He's gonna get
the camp counselor with the hedge trimmer.

00:54:43,654 --> 00:54:45,614
I'll bet
the girl gets away.

Ooh, watch. She's gonna
run in the lodge and hide, but he's gonna get her anyway.

Please be quiet.

- Hey!

You guys gotta shut up.
If you get caught in here, Mom's gonna kill me.

00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,222
What a jerk.
What a wimp.

[Man Over Intercom] Yeah?
It's Hobbs. Listen, it's boiling up here.

The air conditioning on?
It's on full blast.

531

Yeah, well, it must be
blocked up or somethin'.

There's nothing wrong
with the air conditioning. Come up and see for yourself.

I can't begin
to thank you both.

is incredibly valuable.

Where are we going?
Back to town.

544
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:20,602
Arborville is under quarantine
until we've isolated that organism...

545
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:23,855
and checked every living soul
for signs of infection.

- In the meantime, we're your prisoners.
- Not at all. You're my patients.

You're acting like a complete jerk.

with authority figures.

- I think we ought to get out of here.

and blow this town.

around here, don't you think?

a bunch of unmarked trucks.

I repeat:
There is no cause for alarm.

579

This is
a precautionary quarantine...

due to a potential
biological hazard.

01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,110
This is a precautionary measure.
They're just gonna ask a few questions,

that my little brother is over at the movie theater on Main Street.

[Meddows]
We suspected that conditions in space...

631
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,971
would have a mutating effect
on bacteria, but this‒

632
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,140
[Man]
This activity must be what threw the satellite out of orbit.

633
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:00,645
[Meddows]
Correct. Our little experimental virus seems to have grown up...

634
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:04,607
into a plasmic life-form
that hunts its prey.

635
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,819
A predator.
It's fantastic.

636
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:10,780
Sir, the organism is growing
at a geometric rate.

637
01:05:10,864 --> 01:05:14,409
By all accounts,
it's at least a thousand times its original mass.

638
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:18,329
This'll put U.S. Defense
years ahead of the Russians.

639
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:22,667
You don't understand.
At this rate, by next week there may be no U.S.

640
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:23,835
[Meddows]
Nonsense.

641
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:26,170
All we have to do
is contain it properly.

642
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,841
As far as the locals are concerned,
this is simply a medical quarantine.

are at stake.

This isn't one of
your textbook exercises, Mr. Jennings.

649
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:58,661
This is an experiment
in biological warfare. Or hadn't you noticed?

650
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,956
That organism is potentially
the greatest breakthrough in weapons research...

651
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,042
since man split the atom.

652
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:08,546
What we do here
will affect the balance of world power.

653
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,674
Of course there are
lives at stake‒ whole nations, in fact.

654
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:15,011
And that's far more important
than a handful of people in this small town.

655

who says the organism pursued some civilians into the sewers.

It's got Kevin and Eddie
and Meg down there! You gotta do something!

of the sewer system.
