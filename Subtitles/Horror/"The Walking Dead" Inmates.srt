You're a tracker.
You can track.

Come on.

60
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,710
The sun will be up soon.
If we head out now, we can--

Whoever they are,
it means they're alive.

66
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:19,546
No. This means they were alive
four or five hours ago.

They're alive.

68
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:56,700

Got out in a hurry.

Yeah, faith. Faith ain't

Sure as hell didn't do
nothing for your father.

Please, Lizzie, do something.

Stay on the tracks.

211
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,951
That was my mistake.

212
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:45,020
But the woods have more cover.

213
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:48,623
No, you don't understand.

214
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,657
There's a place up the tracks.

215
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:55,160
It's safe. You can take
the children there.

I didn't run.

I didn't leave Lizzie.

Tough little lady.

224

I hadn't gotten back yet.

232
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,959
Rick and I found a car.

233

He took what we had
back to the prison

00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,242
I saw the end.

238
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:22,046
And then...

239
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:24,148
I saw you running
into the woods.

240
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,549
You were far away.
I lost you, but...

241

You found us.

I knew you would.

243

Hey, maybe we can circle
back and find your car.

244
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,942
The walkers

Okay.

Tyreese could have

No.

He'll be all right.

You should both be safe here.

Glenn got out.

It was heading east down the main road.
If I follow in that direction,

- I might be able to pick up its tracks.
- Alone? With just that?

272

I'm out of ammo, so, yeah.

273
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:14,540
I couldn't find Beth.

274
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,841
I know Glenn got out
and I know which way he went.

275
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:19,545
I'm gonna go get him and I'm
gonna come back for you.

If you're trying to make me feel
sorry for you, it's not working.

284

Damn, it means I let myself
get shot up for nothing.

285
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:58,528
The odds of us finding him...

286
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,733
We should be out looking
for food, shelter.

287
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah, why is that?

288
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,467

No, it doesn't have to,
but it can.

against it.

00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,186
( panting )

362
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,423
Did you see if any
of my people got out?

363
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,260
All I saw was my sister
in that field.

364
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:07,897
She wasn't supposed
to be there.

365
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,670
She had a gun,
but they just swarmed her.

366
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,177
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

367
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:19,313
I did it for him.
I trusted him.

368
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,316
And then he just
killed that old man.

369
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:24,751
Hershel?

370
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:31,155
Was his name Hershel?

371
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,534
I'm sorry.

372
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,304
I'm so sorry.

373
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:49,907
Brian, that man, told
us you were bad people.

374
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,977
I know it's not true.

375
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:55,477
I can see it's not,
so what we did, what I did...

376
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:00,648
I mean, I'm a piece of shit.

377
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,983
Why would you want my help?

378
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,151
I don't want it, I need it.

379
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,853
I have to find Maggie.

380
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:19,754
Who's Maggie?

381
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:22,859
She's my wife.

382
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:26,064
You guys got separated?

383
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:29,367
I was on the bus and then I got off
to help and she didn't see me.

384
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,170
How do you know if she made it?

385
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:34,672
I don't know.

386
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:37,208
But Hershel,

387
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,410
Maggie's father,
was a great man.

388
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:43,147
And he told me all I
had to do was believe,

389
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,715
and that's what I'm gonna do.

390
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:46,784
Neither one of us
should be alive right now.

391
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:52,390
She got out, so you're
gonna help me find her.

392
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:56,494
Things aren't over.

393
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,461
They're not over.

394
00:40:58,463 --> 00:41:01,029
I want to believe that.

395
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,467
I want to.

396
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,203
<i>( walkers growling )</i>

397
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,911
You have to.

398
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,965
( gasping )

399
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:52,340
Glenn.
Glenn.

400
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:55,411
Hey, Glenn.

401
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,746
( snarling )

402
00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:02,814

403
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:14,860
( panting )

404
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:20,399
Hope you enjoyed
the show, assholes.

405
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:22,334
<i>( doors open )</i>

406
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,878
You got a damn mouth
on you, you know that?

407
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:34,810
What else you got?

408
