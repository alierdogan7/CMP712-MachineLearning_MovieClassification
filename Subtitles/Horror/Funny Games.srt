00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:53,534
You better be careful, old man,
or I'll break your eggs.

345
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:59,078
Now, please leave, right now.

346
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,680
PAUL: Mr. Farber?
- What?

347
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:01,837
[YELLS]

348
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,278
GEORGIE:
Dad!

349
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:05,146
PETER:
Is it broken?

350
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:08,548
Hey, hey, come on, come on,
come on.

351
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:12,490
Hey. Come on. Behave yourself.

352
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:15,290
Behave yourself, okay?

353
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:17,954
Okay? I don't want to hurt you...

354
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,462
...so you have to behave yourself.

355
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:27,532
GEORGIE: Mom.
- What is it, baby?

356
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,973
PETER: Please, just, ma'am,
stay where you are, okay?

357
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:32,636
Please, stay.

358
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:38,109
- He slapped me in the face.
- Yeah, he started it.

359
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:43,390
PETER: You can help him,
just don't do anything stupid. Help him.

360
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:52,131
- You should bring him a chair.
ANN: What happened?

361
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,392
It's my knee.

362
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,661
PETER: You should take off his pants.
He should sit. Bring him a chair.

363
00:26:56,838 --> 00:26:58,965
Go get him a chair, honey.

364
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,099
Be careful.

365
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,346
PAUL: Peter is a... He's a medical student.
He can help you with it.

366
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,748
PETER:
Can you please take off your pants?

367
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,347
If you don't let me see
your wound, I can't help you.

368
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,491
I'm sorry I hurt you,
but you forced me to, you must admit.

369
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:22,556
PAUL: Come on, Mr. Farber,
be reasonable. Let him look at your leg.

370
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,698
He can help you with it.

371
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:29,235
Would you please...

372
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,735
...leave?

373
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:34,374
Please.

374
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,908
PETER:
We won't get anywhere like this.

375
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,507
PAUL: You have to let him help you,
you don't really have a choice.

376
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:46,620
You're the ship's captain, sir.

377
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:52,158
You're aware that onboard,
the captain's word is law, aren't you?

378
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,953
So, what do you want to do?

379
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,726
You want to call someone?

380
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,891
An ambulance or the police?

381
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,060
I won't stop you.

382
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:06,305
Neither will Tom. Right, Tom?

383
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,238
Well, what are you waiting for?

384
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,042
He dropped the cell phone in the sink.

385
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,717
- Why are you doing this?
PETER: Why not?

386
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:32,063
Okay, let's play another game.

387
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,194
It's a guessing game.

388
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,707
What is this?

389
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,145
Sir?

390
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:00,357
It's a golf ball.

391
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:04,025
Correct. It's a golf ball.

392
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:07,366
But why do I have it in my pocket?

393
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,869
Hm? The lady knows why.

394
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:12,863
Because?

395
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,737
Well?

396
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:22,742
Well?

397
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:27,449
Because you didn't hit it.

398
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:31,782
Correct. Because I didn't hit it.
And why didn't I hit it?

399
00:29:32,326 --> 00:29:35,124
Because something stopped you.

400
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:40,131
Correct. Because I had
to test the club in another way.

401
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,838
Where is he?

402
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:53,878
PAUL:
Cold.

403
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:01,651
Even colder.

404
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:08,853
Cold.

405
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,490
Ice cold.

406
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,738
Warmer.

407
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,406
Warmer.

408
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,411
Little cold.

409
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,082
Warmer.

410
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:35,184
Warmer.

411
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:38,257
Warmer.

412
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:42,856
Cold.

413
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,528
Cold.

414
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:51,034
Warmer.

415
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,332
Warm, cold.

416
00:30:57,378 --> 00:30:59,073
Warmer.

417
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,605
Really warm.

418
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:25,002
Would you please go to the kitchen
and get me something to eat?

419
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,898
That be possible?

420
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:43,184
Maybe there's some bananas or...

421
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:49,294
Please don't think about bringing back
a knife or anything like that...

422
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,363
...or I'd be sorry.

423
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:53,796
For you, I mean.

424
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:04,170
It's getting cloudy.

425
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:11,844
That's very nice of you, thank you.

Yeah!

Hello!

Hi, sweetie.

Where are you?

434
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:43,041
Come on down to the water.

435
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:49,045
We're both thinking the same thing,
aren't we?

436
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:52,116
Hm?

437
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:02,094
We saw your boat.

Hi, Betsy.

439
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,730
Hi, Robert.

When did you get here?

ANN:
Today.

442
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:14,674
We're still unpacking.

443
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:17,709
How long you staying?

444
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:21,449
ANN: Probably a week or two.
We're not sure yet.

445

Oh, wonderful. So nice to see you.

ANN: Let me help you.
BETSY: Thank you.

447
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:33,123
- Have you ever met my sister-in-law?
ANN: No.

448
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,359
Pleased to meet you.

449
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:38,232
Hello, nice to meet you too.

450
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:40,465
Hello. Hi, Robert.

451
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,575
ROBERT: Hi, how are you?
ANN: Fine.

452
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:48,142
This is Paul. He's staying
with the Thompsons next door.

453
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:51,375
- Hi, pleased to meet you.
- Hi, Paul. You cold?

454
00:33:51,552 --> 00:33:55,579
- Oh, no, I have... I have eczema.
- Oh.

455
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:58,748
You should go swimming,
the water works wonders for that here.

456
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:00,951
Thank you, that's good advice.

457
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,425

458
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:04,655
How's George?

459
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,294
Fine, thanks.

460
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:08,799
Where is he?

461
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:14,236
He pulled a muscle putting up the mast,
so he's lying down, resting.

462
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:17,844
BETSY: So sorry to hear that. That's what
happens when you try to do too much.

463
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:21,139
Robert, on the other hand,
would never dream of launching a boat.

464
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:22,976
Right, Robert?

465
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:26,584
Tell your hubby to get better,
we're grilling every night.

466

ANN:
I'll tell him.

467
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:31,752
I mean it, as soon as he's better,
swing by. Robert's son is here.

468
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:34,690
He brought his little girlfriend.
He'd like her for sure.

469
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:37,626
All right. Well, listen,
it's great to see you, darling.

470
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:41,529
Listen, if the weather stays like this,
you'll probably have to take the car.

471
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:43,761

- For tomorrow...

472
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,634
PAUL: Where's your dock?
- Excuse me?

473
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,638
PAUL:
Your dock?

474
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,108
Oh, it's just around the peninsula,
but on the other side.

475
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,645
The old cottage, with the red dock?

476
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:56,544
BETSY:
Right.

477
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:57,979
It's very beautiful.

478

Well, thank you, we enjoy it.

00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:04,783
Well, anyway, it's good to see you.
All right, goodbye.

So you're here all week?

481
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:16,233
BETSY:
Well, this week for sure.

482
00:35:16,504 --> 00:35:17,835
Maybe we'll come by tonight.

483
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:19,996
BETSY:
Oh, do, you know we love seeing you.

484

ANN: All right.
We'll see how George is doing.

485

Yeah, see how he is.

Bye-bye.

They'll be here in two hours...

...and then this little charade of yours
will be over.

490
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,651
PETER:
Sorry, but that's not exactly true.

491
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,191
Didn't you ask your friends to call
and confirm...

492
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:42,158
...or did I misunderstand something?

493

They'll come,
even if they can't reach us.

PAUL:
Is lying allowed?

495
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:51,861
Just a second.
Wait, let me move this out of the way.

496
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:56,776
PETER: Why don't you have a landline?
Don't you find it convenient?

497
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:59,744
Or is it
that you aren't out here that much?

498
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:02,576
Please, have a seat.

499
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,947
You know you can be completely
open with us. You'd feel better.

500
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:08,553
We're being completely open with you.

Right there.

502
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,359
PETER:
You should put a pillow under him.

503
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,764
PAUL: You know, if you'd let Peter
help you, it would hurt less.

504
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:25,599
PETER: I'm happy to help, really,
I just don't want to impose.

505
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,570
PAUL:
Careful with...

506
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:32,937
That's a good idea, put it up.
That should be more comfortable.

507
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:36,579
PETER:
So there we are.

508
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:40,678
- You sure you don't wanna put a pillow...?
- Could you please stop this?

509
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,417
You're asking?

510
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,252
ANN:
What?

511
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:47,621
You said, "Please."

512
00:36:57,705 --> 00:36:59,730
I'm very happy about this.

513
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:02,940
It's easier when things are polite.

514
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:07,479
I'd like to apologize for before.

515
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:12,416
But you have to admit, George,
the slap in the face?

516
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,983
It really wasn't
the most appropriate reaction.

517
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,222
