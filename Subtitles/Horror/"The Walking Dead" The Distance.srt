2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,200
- We're 100 miles away.
- We should go.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,500
We should go to Washington.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,600
We need to find water, food.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,300
How much longer we got?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,300
We can't. We don't know who left it.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,300
- Let's keep moving.
- There's a barn.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,900
Hey. My name is Aaron, I'd like
to talk to the person in charge.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,468
I have good news.

10
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,113
Maggie: <i>Hey.</i>

11
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,086
Everyone...

12
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,402
This is Aaron.

13
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:11,719
We met him outside. He's by himself.

14
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,024
We took his weapons and we took his gear.

15
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:21,339

16
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:25,374
Hi.

17
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,476
(crying)

18
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:32,445
Shh.

19
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,809
It's nice to meet you.

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,751
You said he had a weapon?

21
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,418
There's something you need?

22
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,589
He has a camp, nearby.

23
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:06,665
<i>He wants us to audition for membership.</i>

24
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,836
I wish there was another word.

25
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,711
Audition makes it sound like we're
some kind of a dance troupe.

26
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,780
That's only on Friday nights.

27
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,528
Um, and it's not a camp.

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,563
It's a community.

29
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:29,532
I think you all would make
valuable additions.

30
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,803
But it's not my call.

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,574
My job is to convince you all
to follow me back home.

32
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,211
I know.

33
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:42,848
If I were you, I wouldn't go either.

34
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,353
Not until I knew exactly
what I was getting into.

35
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:49,291
Sasha, can you hand Rick my pack?

36
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,375
Front pocket, there's an envelope.

37
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,845
There's no way I could
convince you to come with me

38
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,748
just by talking about our community.

39
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,784
<i>That's why I brought those.</i>

40
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:16,386
I apologize in advance
for the picture quality.

41
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:19,023
- We just found an old camera store last...
- Nobody gives a shit.

42
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:24,393
You're absolutely 100% right.

43
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,402
That's the first picture
I wanted to show you

44
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:32,838
because nothing I say about
our community will matter

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,275
unless you know you'll be safe.

46
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:37,977
If you join us, you will be.

47
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:41,346
Each panel in that wall

48
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:47,185
is a 15-foot-high, 12-foot-wide
slab of solid steel

49
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:51,656
<i>framed by cold-rolled steel
beams and square tubing.</i>

50
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:56,360
Nothing alive or dead gets
through that without our say-so.

51
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:01,831
Like I said, security
is obviously important.

52
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,666
<i>In fact, there's only one resource</i>

53
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,801
more critical to our community's survival.

54
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,368
The people.

55
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,404
<i>Together we're strong.</i>

56
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:16,907
You can make us even stronger.

57
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:24,446
<i>The next picture, you'll
see inside the gates.</i>

58
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,912

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,889
So we're clear,

62
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,258
that look wasn't a "let's
attack that man" look.

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,688
It was a "he seems like
an okay guy to me" look.

64
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,556
We got to secure him. Dump his pack.

65
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:23,559
- Let's see what this guy really is.
- Rick.

66
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,395
Everybody else, we need
eyes in every direction.

67
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,197
They're coming for us.

68
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,600
We might not know how
or when, but they are.

69
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,506
Me and Sasha, we didn't see him.

70
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,577
If he had wanted to hurt us, he could've.

71
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:40,277
- Anybody see anything?
- Just a lot of places to hide.

72
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,614
Rick: <i>All right, keep looking.</i>

73
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:44,351
What did you find?

74
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,554
Never seen a gun like that before.

75
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:03,104
(groaning)

76
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,740
That's a hell of a right cross there, Rick.

77
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,476
Sit him up.

78
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:14,311
- I think it's better if...
- It's okay.

79
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,912

80
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,950
He's fine. Sit him up.

(groans)

82
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:25,058
You're being cautious.

83
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,558
I completely understand.

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,226
How many of your people are out there?

85
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,227
You have a flare gun. You have
it to signal your people.

86
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,829
How many of them are there?

87
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,902
(sighs)

88
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:40,937
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

89
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,340
Yes, it does.

90
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:46,707
I mean, of course,

91
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,241
it matters how many people
are actually out there,

92
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,641
but does it matter how many people

93
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,943
I tell you are out there?

94
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:58,647
Because I'm pretty sure
no matter what number I say...

95
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,784
eight,

No matter what I say, you're
not going to trust me.

100
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:14,028
Well, it's hard to trust anyone who
smiles after getting punched in the face.

101
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,130
How about a guy who leaves bottles
of water for you in the road?

102
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:24,908
How long you people been following us?

103
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,878
Long enough to see that
you practically ignore

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,681
a pack of roamers on your trail.

105
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:35,088
Long enough to see that despite
a lack of food and water,

106
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,623
you never turned on each other.

107
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,995
You're survivors

108
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:42,064
and you're people.

109
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,865
Like I said, and I hope

110
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,270
you won't punch me for saying it again,

111
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:49,775
that is the most important
resource in the world.

112
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:10,232
How many others are out there?

113
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:12,301
One.

114
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,810
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

115
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:23,279
If it's not words, if it's not pictures,

116
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:25,249
what would it take to convince you

117
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,987
that this is for real?

118
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,597
What if I drove you to the community?

119
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,930
All of you?

120
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,167
We leave now, we'll get there by lunch.

121
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,705
I'm not sure how the 15
of us are going to fit

122
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,141
in the car you and your one
friend drove down here in.

123
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,343
We drove separately. If we found a group,

124
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,248
we wanted to be able
to bring them all home.

125
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,882
There's enough room for all of us.

126
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:52,649
And you're parked just a
couple miles away, right?

127
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:55,355
East on Ridge Road, just
after you hit Route 16.

128
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:58,325
We wanted to get them closer,
but then the storm came,

129
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,196
blocked the road. We couldn't clear it.

130
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:03,068
Yeah, you've really thought this through.

131
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,970
Rick, if I wanted to ambush you,

132
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:07,706
I'd do it here.

133
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,876
<i>You know, light the barn</i>
<i>on fire while you slept,</i>

134
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:12,312
pick you off as you ran out the only exit.

135
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,312
You can trust me.

136
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,285
I'll check out the cars.

137
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:30,123
There aren't any cars.

138
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,624
There's only one way to find out.

139
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:34,025
- We don't need to find out.
- We do.

140
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:39,497
You know what you know
and you're sure of it,

141
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:41,165
but I'm not.

142
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,568
Maggie: Me neither.

143
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,778
Your way is dangerous, mine isn't.

144
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,415
Passing up someplace where we can live?

145
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,817
Where Judith can live?

146
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:02,821
That's pretty dangerous.

147
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:07,625
We need to find out what this is.

148
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,598
We can handle ourselves.

149
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,668
So that's what we're gonna do.

150
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:21,271
Then I will, too.

151
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,840
<i>I'll go.</i>

153
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,413
Yeah.

154
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,547
I'll walk with them.

155
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,950
Rosita?

156
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,856
Okay.

157
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:48,391
If there's trouble,
you got enough firepower?

158
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:50,262
We got what we got.

159
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,368
The walkies are out of juice.

160
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,772
If you're not back in
60 minutes, we'll come.

161
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:01,941
Which might be just what they want.

162
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,114
If we're all in here, we're a target.

163
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:09,615
I've got the area covered.

164
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,454
All right, groups of two, find
somewhere safe within eyeshot.

165
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,512
When the world was still the world,

166
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,612
I worked for an NGO.

167
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:39,715
Our mission was to deliver
medicine and food

168
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,450
to the Niger River Delta.

169
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,887
<i>Bad people pointed guns</i>
<i>in my face every other week.</i>

170
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,157
You're not bad people.

171
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,992
You're not going to kill us.

172
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,394
And we are definitely
not going to kill you.

173
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,366
Just because we're good people

174
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,270
doesn't mean we won't kill you.

175
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,673
If the five of them
aren't back in an hour...

176
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:08,814
I'll put a knife in the base of your skull.

177
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,581
Eyes open, everybody. Weapons up.

178
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,715
You see someone coming at us, you fire.

179
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,212
Abraham: <i>Copy that.</i>

180
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,220
So if we see someone, we just shoot them?

181
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:33,425
It's a good question.

182
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:36,395
Michonne: What if they're someone like us?

183
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:39,365
What if Aaron is telling the truth?

184
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,169
What if they're someone who
has nothing to do with this?

185
00:12:42,171 --> 00:12:44,302
Glenn: We're five people walking with guns.

186
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:47,537
No one's coming up to say hello.

187
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,708
But that's exactly what happened.

188
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:55,377
If it's someone like us, we
should be afraid of them.

189
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,577
He said he was watching us, right?

190
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,381
It means he saw us yesterday.

191
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:02,914
And after everything we've done,

192
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,883
why would he want us to join his group?

193
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:10,514
People like us saved a priest.

194
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:16,048
Saved a girl who rolled up up to
the prison with the Governor.

195
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,649
Saved a crazy lady with a sword.

196
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:26,023
He saw that.

197
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,958
I don't know what he saw.

198
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,298
<i>(Judith crying)</i>

199
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,468
(grunts) Shh.

200
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,667
You did see the jar of
applesauce in my bag, right?

201
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:54,739
This isn't a trick.

202
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,241
This isn't about trying
to make you like me.

203
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:59,176
It's self-preservation.

204
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:02,047
Because if the roamers
hear her and come this way,

205
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,082
I know I'll be the first to go.

206
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:09,187
Shh, shh.

207
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:11,123
All right, come here, come here.

208
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,025
Shh.

209
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,002
You think I'm trying
to poison your baby daughter?

210
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,275
I'm tied up and you've already expressed

211
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:44,510
a willingness to stab me in the head.

212
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:47,113
<i>How would cruelly killing
your daughter in front of you</i>

213
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:49,182
in any way help the situation?

214
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,982
Maybe she doesn't die. Maybe she gets sick.

215
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:54,316
Maybe you're the only one that
can help her and I just lose.

216
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:55,816
I am the only one who can help her

217
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:58,553
because I have applesauce and we all win.

218
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,093
I hate applesauce.

219
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:04,794
My mom used to make me
eat foods I didn't like

220
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,699
to make me more manly.

221
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,669
Salmon patties, applesauce, and onions.

222
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:11,039
She was a very confused woman
who tried her damnedest.

223
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,577
I just bring the jar to show
that we have apple trees nearby.

224
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,214
Like you said, you'll be the first to go.

225
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,660
The community is big enough.

226
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:35,595
We can find a place for you to live

227
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:39,199
where even when she cries, no one,

228
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,436
nothing can hear it outside the walls.

229
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:47,474
You got 43 minutes.

230
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:50,508
(crying continues)

231
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,680
He was telling the truth.

238
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:53,531
Thanks.

239
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,394
All clear?

240
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,197
All clear.

241
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,645
Gracious Ignatius.

242
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,087
Oh, it has been a while.

243
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,218
I think I saw Rex eat three cans one night.

244
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,056
Four. (chuckles)

245
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:46,993
Son of a bitch knew
if he didn't toss 'em back,

246
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:49,162
I'd have come for 'em.

247
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,267
<i>Back at the fire truck,</i>

248
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,837

249
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:02,439
did you think I was gonna hurt you?

250
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:04,139
No.

251
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,607
It's not you.

252
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,999
This, this is ours now.

253
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,869
There's more than enough.

254
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:35,742
It's ours whether or not
we go to your camp.

255
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:39,110
What do you mean? Why wouldn't we go?

256
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:41,982
Michonne: If he were lying

257
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:44,284
or if he wanted to hurt us...

258
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:48,620
but he isn't,

259
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,355
and he doesn't.

260
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:55,063
We need this.

261
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:57,598
So we're going, all of us.

262
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,772
Somebody say something
if they feel differently.

263
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,843
I don't know, man.

264
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,145
This barn smells like horse shit.

265
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,781
Yeah.

266
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,016
We're going.

267
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:26,990
So where are we going? Where's your camp?

268
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,428
Well, every time I've done this,

269
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,631
I've been behind the wheel
driving recruits back.

270
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,637
I believe you're good people.

271
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:40,407
<i>I've bet my life on it.</i>

272
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,942
<i>I'm just not ready to bet</i>
<i>my friends' lives just yet.</i>

273
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:45,510
You're not driving.

274
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:49,148
So if you want to get home,
you'll have to tell us how.

275
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:58,726
Go north on Route 16.

276
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:00,693
And then?

277
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:03,862
I'll tell you when we get there.

278
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:07,701
We'll take 23 north.

279
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:09,637
You'll give us directions from there.

280
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,273
That's... I don't know how else to say it...

281
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,575
That's a bad idea.

282
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:15,145
We've cleared 16.

283
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,646
It'll be faster.

284
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,682
We'll take 23.

285
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,225
We leave at sundown.

286
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:25,593
We're doing this at night?

287
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,427
Rick: <i>Look, I know it's dangerous.</i>

288
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,198
But it's better than riding up
to the gates during the day.

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,137
If it isn't safe, we need to get
gone before they know we're there.

290
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:35,174
No one is going to hurt you.

291
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:36,843
You're trying to protect your group,

292
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,145
but you're putting them in danger.

293
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,881
Tell me where the camp is,
we'll leave right now.

294
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,726
It's going to be a long night.

295
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:54,561
Eat.

296
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,766

Glenn drive with that guy.

00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:36,142
When you said that we were going,

303
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:37,980
was that for real?

304
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:41,513
Or are you just trying to get this
guy to tell you where his camp is?

305
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:47,655
We're going.

306
00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:50,689
Whatever it takes to get there.

307
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:53,126
Just as long as we get there.

308
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,102
When you first came up on the
walls outside Woodbury...

309
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:02,972
What did you hear?

310
00:22:02,974 --> 00:22:05,341

we'll be outside his camp's walls.

315
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:22,164

whether to bring my family in.

He asked me before what it would
take for me to believe it was real.

Truth is...

319
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:40,750
I'm not sure if anything could
convince me to go in there.

320
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,591
But I'm gonna see.

321
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,660

Come on.

359
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:19,086
Come on.

361
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,455
We got to get out of here.

Come on. Come on.

363
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:28,857
Let me see what I can see.

364
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,557
They're coming right for us.

365
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,696
- Yeah, we know.
- Glenn:<i> Come on, come on!</i>

366
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:46,311
We need to leave now.

367
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,147
Hold on.

368
00:26:53,115 --> 00:26:54,885
Shit.

369
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:57,452
Who did that?

370
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:00,722
I need to leave. This is over.

371
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,960
Let me out. I need to
get outta here. It's over.

372
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:04,595
- What's going on?
- Let me out!

373
00:27:04,597 --> 00:27:05,796
Did you see that?

374
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:12,803
Michonne, leave him!
We need to find our people.

375
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:15,838
They saw that flare. They'll think we
shot it. This is how we find them.

376
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,444

377
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,083

Where's Glenn?

381
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:13,352

385
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,177
Run if you want.

386
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:51,679
I got other things to worry about.

387
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:53,578
We can make it together.

388
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,211
But we can only make it together.

389
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:58,781
You said that. I was listening.

390
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:05,424
But we can only make it together.

391
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,806
Rick: <i>Glenn!</i>

392
00:29:08,506 --> 00:29:10,273
He's got to be somewhere around here.

393
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:11,542
Michonne: Glenn!

If you really want to tie me up
again, that's fine, but hurry up.

398
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,689
No time. We're going that way.

399
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,000
Where are they?

400
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,601
I don't know.

401
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:22,401
If this is a trap to get us
back where you want us,

402
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,101
your people are going to die tonight.

403
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,774
Rick: The flare was towards
the water tower.

407
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:58,011
Dad!

408
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,414
- Your sister okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

409
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:06,619
Aaron: Eric? Eric?

410
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:10,789
- Eric?
- <i>In here.</i>

411
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,257
Eric!

412
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:19,300
Eric?

413
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:20,769
I'm okay.

414
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:22,873
It's like a volleyball injury.

415
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,074
It's a broken ankle.

416
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,808
At least that's what Maggie said.

417
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,576
I like her.

418
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:33,246
It's not a big deal.

419
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,085
Oh, my God.

420
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:40,752
I'll just go to the
infirmary when we get back.

421
00:31:40,754 --> 00:31:42,353
Oh...

422
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,435
When I saw that flare go up, I...

423
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:59,003
I thought...

424
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:02,574
You were worried, were you?

425
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:04,477
Yeah.

426
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:07,247
(sighs)

427
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:09,316
This is your fault, you know?

428
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:13,655
Is that so?

429
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,392
Because I love you.

430
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,092
And because when I'm
worried, I do stupid things.

431
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:23,796
And when I do stupid things, I
wind up underneath a rust bucket

432
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:28,065
surrounded by roamers who roll a rear
passenger tire onto my left ankle.

433
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:30,768
(chuckles)

434
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,040
Hey, something good came out of today.

435
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:35,509
While I was waiting for you, I
searched through the neighborhood.

436
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:37,411
I found that.

437
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:47,923
You lost the license plates.

438
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:53,397
I lost the car.

439
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,700
(laughs)

440
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:57,202
Maybe it's for the best.

441
00:32:57,204 --> 00:33:00,373
That monstrosity out front can run.

442
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:04,275
It's so ugly, it'll scare the roamers away.

443
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:06,679
(laughing)

444
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,150
Hi. I'm Eric.

445
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:14,121
Rick.

446
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,756
It's okay.

447
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,869
(chatter)

448
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:32,606
Excuse me. Excuse me.

449
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,339
Everyone.

450
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,876
Thank you.

451
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,482
You saved Eric.

452
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:50,354
<i>I owe you. All of you.</i>

453
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:54,160
And I will make sure
that debt is paid in full

454
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:57,161
when we get to our community.

455
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:59,131
When we get to Alexandria.

456
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:05,502
Now, I'm not sure about you,

457
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:09,141
but I'd rather not do
any more driving tonight.

458
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:13,512
Maybe we can hit the road tomorrow morning.

459
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,251
That sounds fine.

460
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:17,885
But if we're staying here for the night,

461
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:19,452
you're sleeping over there.

462
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:21,855
You really think we got to do that?

463
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:25,694
It's the safe play. We don't know you.

464
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:29,262
The only way you're gonna stop me from being
with him right now is by shooting me.

465
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,900
Whoa.

466
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:45,040
Rick, he told us where the camp is.

467
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,806
And he really was only travelling
with one other person.

468
00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:52,977
They're both unarmed.

469
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:55,078
One of them's got a broken ankle.

470
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,180
I want us to be safe, too.

471
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:08,922
I can't give up everything else.

472
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,324
I know what I said,

473
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:17,327
but it does matter.

474
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:28,474
All right.

475
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,906
- (knocks)
- Yeah?

476
00:35:45,908 --> 00:35:49,946
- (pills rattle)
- Oh, um...

477
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,747
I know it's time for another dose,

478
00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:54,514
but I want to let him
sleep until we get home.

479
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:56,884
No, it's for you.

480
00:35:56,886 --> 00:35:59,854
A few bottles. Don't need
to be stingy with 'em.

481
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:01,687
I know how bad those hurt.

482
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,823
Yeah.

483
00:36:03,825 --> 00:36:05,527
Thank you.

484
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:08,894
Oh, your leg.

485
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:12,327
Did that happen before?

486
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:19,037
During.

487
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,909
Dad and me, car accident.

488
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,812
Rotters in the road.

489
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:29,182
I had a doctor.

490
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:31,286
Probably lucky I can even walk.

491
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:37,026
We have a pretty gifted
surgeon in Alexandria.

492
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,729
His name's Pete.

493
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:42,997
I've seen him do some amazing things.

494
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,798
He might be able to help.

495
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,836
Yeah?

496
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:51,738
Yeah.

497
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:58,483
Yeah.

498
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:05,027
Seven-card stud. Stares and squares.

499
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:07,932
It's aces, cuatros, neeners,
and two-eyed jacks.

500

Tara: <i>So there's 14 wild cards?
Are you serious?</i>

501

Serious as two copulating dogs.

503
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:24,408
Look.

504
00:37:33,176 --> 00:37:34,842
Eyes on the road, champ.

505
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:50,291
How much longer we got?

506
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:53,795
Looks like we're a little
over halfway there. Why?

507
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:57,501
We can make it.

508
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,840
We can make it.

509
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:12,982
(slams) Can't win.

510
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:15,853
Might as well paint it red,
put a ladder on it.

511
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:17,720
All we need is another battery.

512
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:20,058
Where in the hell are we
gonna find another battery?

513
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,793
Right over here.

514
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,265
How'd you know those were there?

515
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,098
Come on.

516
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:43,776
The fight's over.

517
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:46,977
You've got to let it go.

518
00:38:51,015 --> 00:38:52,914
I know it's hard.

519
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:57,014
After it's kept you...

520
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:59,649
Warm and fed and...

521
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,951
Alive.

522
00:39:03,986 --> 00:39:07,121
But the fight...

523
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:10,755
It turns on you.

524
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:14,592
You've got to let it go.

525
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:22,937
That's what Bob was trying to
tell me back at the church.

526
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:27,943
What to risk.

527
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:30,078
When it's safe.

528
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:34,214
When to let someone in.
