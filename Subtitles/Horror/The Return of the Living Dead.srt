and then I'll show him the ropes.

Got to move.

Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, you have a nice 4th,

Okay, Freddy, follow me

00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,225
Okay.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,770
We got an order here from the St.
Louis University Medical School.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,939
They want two adult female
skeletons with perfect teeth.

20
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,734
That's a 2-AF-PT.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,736
Okay? So you come over
here to the "A" section.

22
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,905
- That's "A" for adult, see?
- Okay.

23
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,199
Then that's divided up
into two sections.

24
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,951
That's divided into the "M"
for male and the "F" for...

25
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,870
- Female.
- Good boy.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,538
Now the "PT."

27
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,374
Suppose you think that's
"pretty tough", but no, that's...

28

- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

there and lay it in that crate.

her to be comfortable.

33

Now help me get her in.
Grab her legs.

34
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,226
Okay.

35
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,562

that styrofoam popcorn,

36
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,898

where do they get all the
skeletons with perfect teeth?

49

What really happened was

119
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,628
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the V.A. hospital,

120
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,797
there was a chemical spill

121
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,216
and all that stuff

122
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,053
kinda leaked down into the morgue

123
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,305

124

2-4-5-Trioxin,
it's called.

127
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,357
It was to kinda spray on
marijuana or something.

128
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,484
And the Darrow Chemical Company

129
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,652

for the Army.

130

made the movie

131
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,327
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

132
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,663

facts around.

that contaminated dirt

Well, he's dead now.
And I am bushed.

528
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,967
Hey, uh, buddy boy. Uh,

529
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,887
how long we been friends,
Ernie? About how long? About...

530
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,600
- 25 years, give or take.
- Yeah.

531
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,437
Uh, if I ask you a favor,
could you keep it quiet?

532
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,272
Sure. What is it?

533
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,232
Well, I'm gonna need
some help, Ernie,

534
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,902
in a pretty big way, really.

535
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,321
You can depend on me.
Why? What's wrong?

536
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:44,617
Uh, I got a couple of my men out
here, y-you mind if I let them in?

537
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,785
B-Burt, that's illegal.

538
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,996
You can bring it on in now, please.

539
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,500
Fred, you can put it right
over here. Right here.

540
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,004
What is that?

541
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,967
Right there, please.

542
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,093
- Here?
- Yeah.

543
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,312
I got to...

544
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,022
Yeah.

545
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,902
What the hell is in those bags?

546
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,572
- Rabid weasels.
- What?

547
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,866
What the hell are you
doing with rabid weasels?

548
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,577
I was trying to explain it to
you. They came as a shipment.

549
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,538
'Course, they weren't
supposed to be rabid,

550
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,498
you know, but you know
how these things happen.

551
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,083
No, I don't. How do they happen?

552
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,960
Watch out! Watch out,
Ernie. Don't get bit.

553
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,086
Yeah.

554
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,338
Anyway, we got them,
and we need your help.

555
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,673
How?

556
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,633
We got to get rid of these things.

557
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,177
Well, why don't you
call an animal shelter?

558
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,096
Well, word'd get out,
hurt my business.

559
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,098
You know, that's a
bad scene, rabies.

560
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,516
I don't think so.

561
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,435
I mean, so what?
You don't run a pet store.

562
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,521
So, some lab animals got rabies.

563
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,357
Come on, guys,
take them to the pound.

564
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,193
Well, I just can't do that.

565
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,112
You got to--you got to
take my word for it.

566
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,824
What the hell do you
want me to do?

567
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,743
- You have a crematorium, right?
- You wanna burn them?

568
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,620
Yeah, that's what I
had in mind, actually.

569
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,205
That's cruel.

570
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,748
I can't think of anything else to do.

571
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:18,252
Y-y-you just can't
burn animals alive.

572
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,045
It's just too hideous.

573
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,839
At least let me kill them first.

574
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,425
Take 'em out in the parking lot,
and put 'em out of their misery.

575
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,138
I don't think that'd work, Ernie.

576
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,765
I don't--I don't u-understand
what's going on. W-why not?

577
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,566
Can you swear to keep a secret, Ernie?

578
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,568
At this point, I don't know.

579
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,153
No, no, y-you got to swear.

580
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,322
You got to, or I
just--I can't tell you.

581
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,283
Alright, I swear.

582
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,659
Good.

583
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,082
It's not weasels in the bags.

584
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,878
No. No kidding. Look here.

585
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,014
Oh!

586
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,808
Get it off!

587
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,061
Get it off! Get it off!

588
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,063
Frank!

589
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:20,314
[Screams]

590
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,608
[moans]

591
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,488
I'm sorry, Ernie.

592
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,865
No, it's alright.

593
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,034
[Clears throat]

594
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,831
Ernie, we got a...

595
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,627
We got a long story to tell you.

596
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,796
Oh, great. Some party.

597
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,256
What happened to Trash and Suicide?

598
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,550
Probably getting it on somewhere.

599
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,846
Don't even think it, Chuck.

600
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,641
Oh, God, when's 10:00
gonna come?

601
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,560
Hey, if you wanna split,
we could both go somewhere.

602
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,108
You'd really like to do
it with me, wouldn't you?

603
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,402
Hey, I mean, a girl like
you and a guy like me.

604
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,113
Go choke a chicken.

605
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,282
Oh, come on, Casey.
I was only kidding.

606
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,493
Oh, great, here's your
friend and mine.

607
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,453
Hey, fuck you, ball buster.

608
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,083
Hey, my watch stopped.
What time is it?

609
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,882
Going on 10:00.

610
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,051
Oh, fudge. I'd better
get over and find Freddy.

611
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,137
He's gonna be getting
off any time now.

612
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,680
Okay. Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

613
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,765
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- Alright.

614
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:38,923
[Spider mocks]
Gee, fudge.

615
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,145
[Spider chatters]

616
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,354
[Casey laughs]

617
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,084
[siren sounds]

618
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,907
[ring]

619
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,037
Come on, Freddy, where are you?

620
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,413
Frankly, Burt,

621
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,208
I think you acted precipitously
in cutting up the corpse.

622
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:47,002
Well, you may be right,
I don't know, but I did it.

623
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,213
So what--what are we
gonna do about it, Ernie?

624
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,384
If I let you use the crematorium,
what's in it for me?

625
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,097
What do you want?

626
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,600
Well, uh,

627
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,311
the way I see it,
this is a pretty big favor.

628
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,480
Well, Ernie, you got it!
Whatever it is you want,

629
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,774
so help me, I'll--
I'll do it. I promise.

630
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,029
I'm sorry about that.

631
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,494
[Sighs]

632
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,847
Alright. Let's take
care of your problem.

633
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,149
Yes siree,

634
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,984
you're gonna owe me a big one.

635
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,820
Now buddy-boy, you go get rid of
everything for me. Nothing left.

636
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,030
- Is that right?
- Everything'll go.

637
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,328
What about the bones?

638
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,621
Bones are no problem.

639
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,457
The hardest thing to burn
is the heart.

640
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,960
The heart? Why?

641
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,087
'Cause it's just one big,
tough muscle.

642
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,631
Yeah, but Ernie, I
mean, come on. We don't--

643
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,466
We don't want the heart
sticking around.

644
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,385
Then I'll turn it up
hotter for the heart.

645
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,429
And what about the split dogs?
They got to go, too.

646
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,514
The split dogs will go, too.

647
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,812
Come on, just give me a hand.
It's your mess.

648
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,109
Oh.
[Groaning]

649
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,404
Some big favor.

650
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,115
I can operate that goddamn thing.

651
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,367
You're absolutely certain

652
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,495
that this will get rid of
everything and do the trick?

653
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,665
- I mean, nothing left?
- Nothing but a little pile of ashes.

654
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,500
We don't even want the ashes, Ernie.

655
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,463
Well, then I'll turn it up higher,
and we'll burn up the ashes, too.

656
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,134
Dust to dust.

657
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:15,700
[♪♪♪]

658
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,111
- Oh, my radio.
- Come on, you guys.

659
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,947
Let's get back to the car.
Damn it.

660
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,156
Come on.

661
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,756
Freddy?

662
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,342
Anybody?

663
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,803
Get the fuckin' top! Fuck.


664
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,930
Get the fuckin' top, man!

665
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,642
Come on!

666
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,646
Close the motherfuckin' windows.

667
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,065
I don't have any windows.
I busted them.

668
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,403
- Hey, my skin burns.
- Me, too. Damn it.

669
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,613
It's that rain,
it's like acid rain.

670
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,157
Start the car!

671
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,826
It's all over me. A towel,
somebody give me a towel.

672
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,912
- We ain't got no towel!
- Well, then give me something.

673
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,873
- Give me that.
- No!

674
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,458
Give me something!

675
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,834
Come on, start!

676
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,795
- Suicide, get the car going.
- I'm trying.

677
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:02,132
Oh, crap, I wonder what's
in that rain.

678
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,480
Look at it.

679
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,618
It's coming down like,
einen getrunken soldat.

680
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,722
- Is the heart gone, Ernie?
- It's all burned up.

681
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,225
- Are you sure?
- Right up the chimney.

682
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:56,103
Goddamn, that's all we need.
We're home free, Frank.

683
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,647
We got it made. You just
saved our ass, buddy boy,

684
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,899
and I owe you one. Goddamn!

685
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,485
Yes, you do.

686
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,695
Alright, let's get back to that
warehouse, clean up the mess,

687
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,072
and get the hell out of there.

688
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,490
What do you say, Frank?

689
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,325
Okay, just--just give
me a second to rest,

690
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,202
catch my breath.
Then we'll do it, okay?

691
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,955
Frank, I don't know about
you, but I'm really sick.

692
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,791
Why? What's wrong, Fred?

693
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,668
I feel like hell is what's wrong.

694
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,295
- I'm really sick.
- I'm sick, too, Burt.

695
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,923
Sick, like how?

696
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,259
I feel like my head's
going to bust wide open.

697
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:30,345
