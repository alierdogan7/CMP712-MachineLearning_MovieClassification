00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:54,308
-EDDY: Oh, you don't think so, huh?
-Not that you scared me, but...

501
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:56,046
No, of course not.

502
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:59,221
Eddy, is there really a Cropsy maniac?

503
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,225
Sure there is. He's from my neighborhood.

504
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:05,628
Know what he does?
He takes paper bags, see?

505
00:44:05,696 --> 00:44:08,494
He fills them with dog shit,
then he lights them

506
00:44:08,632 --> 00:44:11,100
and leaves them in front of somebody's
door and when they open the door,

507
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:12,760
they go like that.

508
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:19,207
-You're crazy.
-Yeah, I know. Crazy for you.

509

I can't figure you out, you know.

510

I mean, first you tell me you like me,
and then 10 seconds later

-I do like you, Eddy. But...
-But what?

513

You're always talking about
how many women you've had.

514

I don't want to be just another statistic.

516

517

519

We like each other, right? And we're alone.

00:44:58,716 --> 00:45:02,846
You can't blame me for trying, can you?
Come on, what do you say?

-Maybe.
-Maybe.
