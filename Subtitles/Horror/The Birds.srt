320
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:05,392
A gull hit me,
Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

322
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:22,578
Oh, hi.
Did you find her all right?
Yes, I did.

323
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,882
I was wondering...

324
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:27,787
Uh, that sign there.

325
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:31,452
Do you suppose
I could have the room
for just a single night?

326
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:34,519
I was planning on renting it
for a longer time...
I would appreciate it.

327
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:37,930
I've tried
everywhere in town.
They're all full.

328
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,163
Well, all right.
Got your bags in the car?

329
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:45,474
[Chuckles]
Well, it's utilitarian,
I'll say that.

330
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,476
I just picked up
some things for the night
at the general store.

331
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:51,570
I hadn't planned
on staying very long.

332
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:55,481
Yes, I know.
Did something
unexpected come up?

333
00:31:57,186 --> 00:32:00,451
Yes. May I use your phone?
I'd like to call home.

334
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:03,754
I just put some coffee
on the stove.

<i>I can't tell which is which. </i>
<i>Well, I suppose so. </i>

<i>Hello there. </i>
<i>Annie had no plans, huh? </i>
<i>No. </i>

345
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,275
We're very glad
you could come.
Are you hungry?

346
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:29,607
Reasonably.
Dinner's just
about ready.

347
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,011
We've been looking
at the chickens. Something
seems to be wrong with them.

348
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:34,049
There's nothing wrong
with those chickens.

349
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:36,778
I'm going to call
Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
What good's that gonna do?

350
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:38,914
The chickens won't eat.

351
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,277
He sold the feed to me,
didn't he?

352
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,979
Caveat emptor, Mother.
Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?

353
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:48,318
Merely quoting
the law, dear.
Never mind the law.

354
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:59,760
This won't take long,
Miss Dan... Hello, Fred?
Lydia Brenner.

355
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:01,962
I didn't interrupt
your dinner, did I?
How about a drink?

356
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:06,133
I'd love one.
That feed you
sold me is no good.

357
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:11,475
The chicken feed.
Well, it's just no good.
The chickens won't eat it.

358
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,640
They're always hungry.

359
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:16,809
I opened a sack for them
when I got home, and they
just wouldn't touch it.

360
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:19,149
You know chickens
as well as I do,
and when they won't eat,

361
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:22,486
there's something wrong
with what they're being fed.

362
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:26,494
No, they're not
fussy chickens.

363
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:29,725
Who? What's he
got to do with it?

364
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:32,562
Is that your father?
Mm-hmm.
Please sit down.

365
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:36,832
I don't care how many sacks
of feed you sold him.
My chicken...

366
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:41,837
Oh, I see.

367
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,242
Dan Fawcett.

368
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:48,272
This afternoon?
That proves what I'm saying.
The feed you sold us...

369
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:53,851
Oh.

370
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:57,517
Well, maybe I better
go over and see him.

371
00:34:57,593 --> 00:35:01,359
You don't think
there's something
going around, do you?

372
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,864
No, never!

373
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:08,301
No, they don't
seem sick at all.
They just won't eat.

374
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,703
Uh-huh.

375
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:16,369
Well, I'll try
to go over and see him.
Maybe he...

376
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:19,346
Uh-huh.
All right.

377
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:21,905
Thanks.

378
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:26,653
He had a call from
Dan Fawcett a while ago.

379
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:28,656
His chickens
won't eat either.

380
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:32,160
It's what you said, Mom.
Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed
is no good.

381
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:35,890
No, Cathy.
He sold Mr. Fawcett
a different brand.

382
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:39,400
You don't think
they're getting sick,
do you, Mitch?

383
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,175
I still don't understand
how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Your brother told me.

384
00:35:50,245 --> 00:35:54,079
Then you knew Mitch
in San Francisco?
Is that right?

385
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:56,174
No, not exactly.

386
00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:00,984
Mitch knows a lot
of people in San Francisco.
Of course, they're mostly hoods.

387
00:36:01,056 --> 00:36:05,015
- Cathy!
- Well, Mom, he's
the first to admit it.

388
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:08,790
He's spends half his day
in the detention cells
at the Hall of Justice.

389
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:12,163
In a democracy, Cathy,
everyone is entitled
to a fair trial.

<i>practice... </i>
Aw, Mom, please!

391
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,267
I know all
that democracy jazz.
They're still hoods.

392
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:24,572
He has a client now
who shot his wife
in the head six times.

393
00:36:24,646 --> 00:36:27,740
Six times!
Can you imagine it?

394
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:31,877
I mean, even twice
would be overdoing it,
don't you think?

395
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:35,446
- Why did he shoot her?
- He was watching
a ball game on television.

396
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:38,516
- What?
- His wife changed the channel.

397
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:43,998
Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?
I don't think so.

398
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,500
I have to get back
to San Francisco.

399
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:48,559
Don't you like us?

400
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:51,071
Oh, darling,
of course I do.

401
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:53,972
<i>Don't you like</i>
<i>Bodega Bay? </i>
I don't know yet.

402
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:57,569
Mitch likes it very much.
He comes up every weekend,
you know,

403
00:36:57,646 --> 00:37:00,513
<i>even though he has</i>
<i>his own apartment</i>
<i>in the city. </i>

404
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:03,949
<i>He says San Francisco's</i>
<i>like an anthill</i>
<i>at the foot of a bridge. </i>

405
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,544
I suppose it does get
hectic at times.

406
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:10,956
Well, if you do decide to come,
don't say I told you about it.

407
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:13,221
It's supposed to be
a surprise party.

408
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:16,423
<i>They've got</i>
<i>this whole complicated</i>
<i>thing figured out... </i>

409
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,932
where I'm going to Michele's
for the afternoon,

410
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:23,097
and Michele's mother will say
that she has a headache, would
I mind if she took me home.

411
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:26,197
Then when I get home here,
all the kids'll jump out!

412
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,312
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

413
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,018
I don't think so.

414
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:42,814
She's a charming girl,
isn't she, Mitch?
<i>Hmm? Yes. </i>

415
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:45,257
Certainly pretty.
<i>Mm-hmm. </i>

416
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:49,354
- How long have you known her?
- Now, I told you, dear,
we met yesterday.

417
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:51,626
In a bird shop.
<i>In a bird shop. </i>

418
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,634
She was selling birds?

419
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:57,934
No, no. I just led her
into believing that I believed
she was, and then...

420
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:01,840
<i>It's all very complicated. </i>
But she did buy the lovebirds
and then drove all the way here.

421
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,844
<i>Mother. </i>
Yes?

422
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:07,279
Where did you
go to law school?

423
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:09,283
Forgive me.

424
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:12,878
I suppose I'm
just naturally curious
about a girl like that.

425
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:14,888
She's very rich,
isn't she?

426
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:18,551
Yeah, I suppose so.
Her father's part owner of
one of the big newspapers.

427
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:21,790
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

428
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:25,799
She's always mentioned
in the columns, Mitch.
Yes, I know.

429
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:30,736
She is the one who jumped
into a fountain in Rome
last summer, isn't she?

430
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,740
Yes.

431
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:37,404
I supposed I'm old-fashioned.
I know it was supposed to be
very warm there, but...

432
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:41,973
Well, actually the newspapers
said she was naked.
Yes, I know, dear.

433
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,883
It's none of my business,
but when you bring
a girl like that...

434
00:38:44,953 --> 00:38:47,217
<i>Darling? </i>
Yes?

435
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,986
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

436
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,995
Well... as long as you know
what you want, Mitch.

437
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:59,025
I know exactly
what I want.

438
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,675
Be able to find
your way back all right?
Oh, yes.

439
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:13,281
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's
a long way from here.

440
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:16,010
I'm in San Francisco
five days a week with a lot
of time on my hands.

441
00:39:16,084 --> 00:39:19,713
I'd like to see you.
Maybe we could go swimming
or something.

442
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:22,313
Mother tells me
you like to swim.

443
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,121
How does Mother know
what I like to do?
We read the same gossip column.

444
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:30,563
Oh, that... Rome.
I really like to swim.
We might get along very well.

445
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:34,295
In case you're interested,
I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?

446
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,304
With all my clothes on.
The newspaper that ran
that story...

447
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:39,465
happens to be a rival
of my father's paper.

448
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:42,977
You were just a poor, innocent
victim of circumstances?
I'm neither poor nor innocent.

449
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:46,480
The truth of that particular...
The truth is, you're running
around with a pretty wild crowd.

450
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:49,813
Yes, that's the truth, but I
was pushed into that fountain,
and that's the truth too.

451
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:53,286
Uh-huh. Do you really
know Annie Hayworth?

452
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:55,846
No. At least I didn't
until I came up here.

453
00:39:55,924 --> 00:39:57,858
So you didn't go
to school together?
No.

454
00:39:57,926 --> 00:39:59,860
And you didn't come here
to see her?
No!

455
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:01,919
You were lying!
Yes, I was lying.

456
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:04,659
What about the letter
you wrote me? Is that a lie?
No, I wrote the letter.

457
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,998
- Well, what did it say?
- It said, <i>"</i>Dear Mr. Brenner.

458
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,766
I think you need
these lovebirds after all.
They may help your personality."

459
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,933
<i>That's what it said. </i>
But you tore it up?

460
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:15,203
<i>Yes. </i>
Why?

461
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,541
Because it seemed
stupid and foolish.

462
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:20,740
- Like jumping into
a fountain in Rome.
- I told you what happened!

463
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:21,908
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

464
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:24,008
I don't give a damn
what you believe!

465
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:26,576
- I'd still like to see you.
- Why?

466
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:28,145
I think it might be fun.

467
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:31,624
That might've been
good enough in Rome,
but it's not good enough now.

468
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,217
<i>It is for me. </i>
Well, not for me.

469
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:35,661
- What do you want?
- I thought you knew.

470
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,326
I want to go through life...
jumping into fountains naked.
Good night.

474
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:09,955
Is something wrong?
Is that cut beginning
to bother you?

475
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:12,295
No, it's not the cut
that's bothering me.

476
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:17,636
- Would you like some brandy?
- If you have some, I'd love it.

477
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:20,231
I'll get it.
Why don't you sit down.

478
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:23,368
Oh, would you like a sweater
or something, a quilt?

479
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:25,709
No. No, thank you.

480
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:30,445
Won't you call me Melanie?

481
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,546
<i>All right. </i>

482
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:43,319
Thank you.
Gets a bit chilly here
at night sometimes,

483
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:46,986
especially if you're
over near the bay.

484
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:49,655
Well, how did
your evening go?

485
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:53,725
<i>Did you meet Lydia? </i>

486
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:56,736
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

487
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:58,829
I think so.

488
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:05,304
- Well, how do you like
our little hamlet?
- I despise it.

489
00:42:06,714 --> 00:42:09,649
I suppose it doesn't offer much
to the casual visitor,

490
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:12,709
unless you're thrilled
by a collection of shacks
on a hillside.

491
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:14,982
It takes a bit
of getting used to.

492
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:17,957
<i>Where are you from</i>
<i>originally? </i>
San Francisco.

493
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:21,256
How did you happen
to come up here?

494
00:42:22,663 --> 00:42:27,259
A friend invited me
up for a weekend
a long time ago.

495
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:31,199
Look, I see no reason
for being coy about this.

496
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:34,969
<i>It was Mitch Brenner. </i>
<i>I guess you knew that anyway. </i>
I suspected as much.

497
00:42:35,042 --> 00:42:37,408
Well, you needn't worry.

498
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:40,413
It's been over and done with
a long time ago.

499
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:45,350
Annie, there's nothing
between Mr. Brenner and me.
<i>Isn't there? </i>

500
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:48,081
Well, maybe there isn't.

501
00:42:48,155 --> 00:42:50,817
Maybe there's
never been anything
between Mitch and any girl.

502
00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:53,759
What do you mean?

503
00:42:53,828 --> 00:42:56,922
I think I'll have
some of that.

504
00:42:56,998 --> 00:42:59,762
I was seeing a lot of him
in San Francisco.

505
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,029
One weekend, he invited me
up to meet Lydia.

506
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:07,336
- When was this?
- Oh, four years ago,
shortly after his father died.

507
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:11,674
<i>Of course, things</i>
<i>may be different now. </i>
Different?

508
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:14,476
With Lydia.

509
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:18,576
<i>Did she seem</i>
<i>a trifle distant? </i>
Mm, a trifle.

510
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:21,952
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

511
00:43:22,023 --> 00:43:25,515
<i>You know, her attitude</i>
<i>nearly drove me crazy. </i>

512
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:28,118
When I got back to
San Francisco, I spent days
trying to figure out...

513
00:43:28,195 --> 00:43:30,129
what I'd done
to displease her.

514
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:34,133
- Well, what had you done?
- Nothing.

515
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:38,900
I simply existed.
So what's the answer?
Ajealous woman, right?

516
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:40,941
<i>A clinging, </i>
<i>possessive mother? </i>

517
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:45,035
Wrong. With all due respect
to Oedipus, I don't think
that was the case.

518
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:48,138
Then what was it?

519
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:51,207
Lydia liked me.
That's the strange part.

520
00:43:51,285 --> 00:43:54,220
Now that I'm no longer a threat,
we're very good friends.

521
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:58,725
- Then why did she
object to you?
- Because she was afraid.

522
00:43:58,793 --> 00:44:03,025
- Afraid you'd take Mitch?
- Afraid I'd <i>give</i> Mitch.

523
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:05,031
<i>I don't understand. </i>

524
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,195
Afraid of any woman who
would give Mitch the one thing
Lydia <i>can</i> give him: love.

525
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:11,795
That adds up to
a jealous, possessive woman.

526
00:44:11,872 --> 00:44:14,966
No, I don't think so.

527
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:18,205
You see, she's not afraid
of losing Mitch.

528
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:20,577
She's only afraid
of being abandoned.

529
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:25,085
- Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.
- [Chuckles]

530
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:28,121
No. She already
has a daughter.

531
00:44:28,189 --> 00:44:33,183
Well, what about Mitch?
Didn't he have anything
to say about this?

532
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,854
Well, I can understand
his position.

533
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,728
He'd just been through
a lot with Lydia
after his father died.

534
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:42,166
- He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.
- Oh, I see.

535
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:44,727
<i>So it ended. </i>
<i>Not right then, of course. </i>

536
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:49,742
We went back to San Francisco,
saw each other now and then,
but we both knew it was over.

537
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,406
- Then what are you doing
here in Bodega Bay?
- I wanted to be near Mitch.

538
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:58,077
<i>Oh, it was over and done with, </i>
<i>and I knew it, but... </i>

539
00:44:58,152 --> 00:45:01,178

to be near him.
