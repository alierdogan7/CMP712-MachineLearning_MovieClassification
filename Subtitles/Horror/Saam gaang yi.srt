1
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:25,598
China-Hong Kong Border

2
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,845
Block 37? Down there

3
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,013
Thanks

4
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:25,744
Mrs. Lee, you're beautiful

5
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:29,076
They say your dumplings
are the most expensive

6
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,307
Of course; come in

7
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,982
You've come in the right time

8
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,052
The water is boiling, waiting for you

9
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,825
I know you

10
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:51,533
I watched you on TV;
when I first came to Hong Kong

11
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,660
You're a star!

12
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,506
I retired long ago

13
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,337
Please, sit

14
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:04,106
Guess how old I am

15
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,445
Sit here, please

16
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,460
Here

17
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,477
Guess, Mrs. Lee

18
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,846
Well...

19
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,883
You're in your thirties

20
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:50,092
I'm old; call me Aunt Mei

21
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,101
You don't have wrinkles

22
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,827
And I have good color

23
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,232
I'm my own best advertisement

24
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:06,001
Your skin is great

25
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:10,343
My dumplings are worth it

26
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,410
You get what you pay for

27
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,077
Mrs. Lee

28
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,442
Let me get you more cabbage

29
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:51,417
I bet you dislike chives with their strong flavor

30
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,216
This cabbage is great

31
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,985
I'll cut it smaller, squeeze it dry

32
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:58,096
I'll put more ginger in the filling

33
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,527
Up to you Okay

34
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:15,737
The Northerners always say...

35
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:19,579
Good feeling comes from a nap
Good taste comes from a dumpling

36
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,683
These have 1,400 years of history

37
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,718
But the Southerners still say

38
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:30,727
It's just meat-stuffed dough, nothing special

39
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:45,743
I use high-gluten flour

40
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:48,275
For texture and chewiness

41
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:51,575
I knead it fine

42
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:55,415
Until it is like a peeled egg

43
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,749
Smooth, translucent, and soft

44
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,988
There is a secret to keep the filling
from leaking out

45
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:58,481
So that the juicy flavor explodes in the mouth

46
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,722
Mrs. Lee

47
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,165
Eat while it's warm

48
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,393
Take your time

49
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:44,257
Behave, baby

50
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,825
I eat these often. They're nutritious

51
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,194
Sometimes in soup...

52
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,035
or minced and steamed with citrus peel

53
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,733
But the dumplings are best

54
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,303
They made me famous

55
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,079
Here, baby

56
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,791
It's shame to discard this

57
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,994
Wash it

58
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:26,037
Bury it with the flowers

59
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,436
They will bloom especially well

60
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,678
Let me tell you

61
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:38,609
Expensive cosmetics claim to contain...

62
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:44,586
bird's nest, longevity mushrooms
bee's pollen, pearls...

63
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,355
essence of hot springs

64
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,156
All lies!

65
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,927
For women to look younger,

66
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:53,564
you must start from inside...

67
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,564
for the best color

68
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,197
Only my secret formula can do this

69
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,748
Mrs. Lee...

70
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:19,885
think of the results, not what it was

71
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,298
Let me sing for you

72
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,128
After my customers eat...

73
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,204
I often sing songs from my youth...

74
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:09,205
for entertainment; listen:

75
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:20,444
Lake Hung waters are rough

76
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:28,492
At the shore is my home

77
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:36,430
At dawn, boats go out with nets

78
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:47,841
At dusk, they return loaded with fish

79
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:52,013
Wild ducks and lotus roots are here

80
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:56,815
Autumns are bountiful with rice

81
00:12:56,856 --> 00:13:04,262
They say heaven is beautiful

82
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:17,275
How can it compare with Lake Hung?

83
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,861
The kitchen cabinets
will be delivered tomorrow

84
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:46,565
Bring soup the day after tomorrow

85
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:48,600
Excuse me, Mr. Lee, I have to go

86
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:50,366
deliver Mrs. Lee's soup now

87
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:57,940
Mr. Lee, you've stayed here for months

88
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:59,615
You don't want to leave

89
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,484
My home is being renovated

90
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:06,948
My dining set just arrived from Paris

91
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,957
It's too humid, my designer refuses to work

92
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:16,261
I'm fussy like him

93
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:20,832
If it doesn't feel good, I reject it

94
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,109
Please behave

95
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,534
Stop it...

96
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,603
I'll behave when I eat

97
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:35,485
You are naughty I can't break it

98
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,026
What is it?

99
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:47,597
Good for you

100
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:52,602
It looks horrible

101
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,477
Try some? No, thanks

102
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:24,929
Your soup, Madam

103
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:30,236
What did she say to Mr. Lee?

104
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:31,703
I don't know

105
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,287
Shenzhen, China

106
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:02,799
I went through so much to get these

107
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:06,975
It is hard to keep secret
I hear reporters want pictures

108
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,206
The problem is from Hong Kong
Don't come for the next two weeks

109
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,384
Even the locals can't get a hold of the stock

110
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,651
We'll see

111
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:18,349
This is for you Thank

112
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,588
You know him? Who?

113
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:27,664
S.N. Wang Oh, him

114
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,391
Why did you break up?

115
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:30,726
It was long ago

116
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:32,495
He disliked the one-child policy

117
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,072
But I was aborting over 10 fetuses a day...

118
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,801
or over 3,000 a year; over 30,000 for 10 years

119
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,070
Because I had done so many abortions

120
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:44,012
He was afraid we would be cursed

121
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:45,706
It was national policy Yes...

122
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,147
I was serving the people; Thanks

123
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,752
Thanks; bye

124
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,548
This way, Miss

125
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:59,095
China-Hong Kong Border

126
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,633
X-ray, please That one?

127
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,162
The lunchbox Okay

128
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,345
Open it

129
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:30,787
Ham and egg on rice?

130
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,989
Yes, lunch for my son:

131
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,724
Ham egg, plain rice

132
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:39,904
You may go Thanks

133
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,037
Thank you

134
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,877
I didn't lie to you, trust me

135
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,384
Stop it!

136
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:57,847
Anna!

137
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,616
Believe me, I didn't lie to you

138
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,625
Stop following me

139
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:04,889
You better stop or I'll beat you into pieces

140
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:12,728
I taped these for you

141
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,803
Enjoy!

142
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,589
Hello? Fung!

143
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,458
Yes

144
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,128
Is it raining in London?

145
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,535
Your mom said you maxed out your credit card

146
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,379
Who are you with? A girl?

147
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:57,606
Girlfriend?

148
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:00,879
You're dating?

149
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,919
Does your mom know?

150
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,322
And she tells me...

151
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,586
she hasn't seen your report card

152
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,560
You did well to choose me as your sponsor

153
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,634
I'll call you later

154
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:18,997
Okay? Bye!

155
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,232
Dating at thirteen!

156
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,600
Dating at thirteen?

157
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,775
Puppy love. Your son?

158
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:29,175
I look that old?

159
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,975
Do you have children?

160
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:38,152
We don't know whose fault it is

161
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,090
I'll bring back your youth...

162
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,786
and his heart

163
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,869
Do you have more potent stuff
for faster results?

164
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:05,241
It's best in the 5th or 6th month

165
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:08,920
Extract it by breaking the water sac
and slide it

166
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:12,523
It's covered by a layer of creamy fat

167
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,785
The colors are defined
and you can see the cranium

168
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:20,029
And the little hands and feet moving around

169
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,661
In the first trimester, they're this small

170
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,770
By the third trimester, they're too tough

171
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,401
The 5th month is perfect, kitten-like...

172
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:35,077
and most nutritious

173
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,978
Let me show you

174
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:44,311
Some say even if you're eighty

175
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:45,749
After eating them

176
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,755
You feel eighteen again

177
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:50,759
See

178
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,170
This is what I chopped up

179
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:12,234
You're still afraid?

180
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,376
I was a doctor

181
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,943
In China, only the best minds
could study medicine

182
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,719
My forte was surgery with no bleeding

183
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:25,150
Always bloodless

184
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,091
So you've saved many lives

185
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,627
Nothing is left after I'm done!

186
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,024
We must all face our fates

187
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:39,268
Our fates are all different

188
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,475
So we must treasure our time...

189
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,434
and live well

190
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,622
Honey?

191
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:21,425
I'm at your favorite bakery

192
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:24,167
Want some custard tarts?

193
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,598
I'm working Really?

194
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,030
I'm be home late

195
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,907
Remember your promise

196
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,571
Of course; our 15th anniversary

197
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,014
I'll keep you company tomorrow

198
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:43,143
Okay? Bye

199
00:25:57,936 --> 00:25:59,563
You were just on a trip last week

200
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,773
You promised to be with me

201
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,300
I'm just going for a few days

202
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,482
I want to visit my nephew in London

203
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,519
Sure, if you like

204
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,688
And go shopping, too

205
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:29,962
So many zeroes?

206
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,465
You used to laugh a lot

207
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:37,507
Aren't you happy with all the zeroes?

208
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,571
Laughing doesn't equal happy

209
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,807
Plus, you're not coming

210
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,606
I'll be gone 4 or 5 days

211
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,382
And if not?

212
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,488
I'll write you another as a fine

213
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:55,455
Fines are for mistakes

214
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:57,921
Whatever

215
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,231
Hello? If you don't send that contract

216
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:06,968
I'll change my mind

217
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:12,171
Not more than 950 million

218
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,521
These are bland and crunchy

219
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:32,627
By the 2nd months
they have little hands and feet

220
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,789
And ears too! Those were bones?

221
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,395
Nah... their bones aren't hard

222
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,594
I'll chop them finer next time

223
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,603
Cook them in broth next time

224
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:47,171
It will enhance the flavor

225
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,977
Are you done?

226
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,762
This can't go on Why?

227
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:48,400
My skin is still flabby

228
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:54,106
It's much better!

229
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,371
I need your most potent stuff

230
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,517
I'll find it...

231
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:01,618
let me sing now

232
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,715
Sing as you wish, I must go

233
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,619
Bye, Mrs. Lee...

234
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:11,656
Mrs. Lee, this way please

235
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,497
I'll find it for you

236
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,668
Call me when you do Don't worry!

237
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:21,705
Aunt Mei?

238
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,968
You are...? Mrs. Kam recommended you

239
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,644
Come in; hello, Little girl

240
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,155
Beg Aunt Mei

241
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,090
Find someone else

242
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:47,491
Where? Mrs. Kam says you were
a great doctor in China

243
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:48,690
I believe her

244
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:51,628
It's too dangerous

245
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,267
Let me recommend a Shenzhen hospital

246
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:01,207
It's quite good, and it's legal

247
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:06,983
I know, but I can't afford the fees

248
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,517
Black market, then

249
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:11,112
You are the black market

250
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:13,950
No, I'm not!

251
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:30,206
Her feet are swollen

252
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:36,678
She's showing

253
00:30:37,182 --> 00:30:38,649
I thought she gained weight

254
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:44,319
She's five months along

255
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,220
In the first trimester, I could scrape the vagina

256
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,851
But now it's all in place; I can't force it

257
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:53,222
The bones will pierce the vagina

258
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,565
It's too dangerous; no

259
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:59,335
I beg you; she's only fifteen

260
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,473
I'm retired, and it's illegal

261
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:06,004
How can she give birth to a baby?

262
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:07,473
She's too young to be a mother

263
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,860
Say something! Speak!

264
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,891
Speak up and beg Aunt Mei!

265
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:31,031
I must tell you

266
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:36,197
Her dad did it; we can't keep it

267
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:40,171
Please abort it for her

268
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:42,837
It's a monster

269
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,178
Once the baby is born...

270
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,719
Is it my child or grandchild?

271
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:53,685
Please

272
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,406
Quit your job today

273
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,806
Will you be my sugar daddy?
I can afford you

274
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:19,082
You don't eat that much

275
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:20,976
I do

276
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,010
You like to laugh, too

277
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:55,763
Your home is so grand!

278
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,575
What's the use? It's empty

279
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,371
It's a house, not a home

280
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:05,911
My husband is with some young girl

281
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:08,017
Did he notice the difference?

282
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:16,019
I can't wait, I need your best

283
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,032
For youth and beauty

284
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:32,267
Women must fight time

285
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:38,648
I used to always laugh

286
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,749
After high school, I went into a TV series

287
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:44,516
I became very popular

288
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,289
Mr. Lee was the sponsor of my show

289
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,554
I fell during a stunt

290
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:55,155
And he held me

291
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,594
So you married him?

292
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:00,302
I was just 20

293
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:02,835
Everyone wants to marry well

294
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,271
He was in his thirties, and he loved me

295
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:10,247
I thought it would be "happily ever after"

296
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:12,975
All men love 20-years-old gals

297
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:16,882
Yes, when they are in their thirties...

298
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:20,414
and in their 40's and 50's...

299
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:24,361
and in their 60's and 70's

300
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:27,626
I let it go

301
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:31,326
As long as he doesn't flaunt it

302
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:35,161
Men are all the same...

303
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:38,037
all they know is sex

304
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:42,378
What's so good about a 20-year-old?

305
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:45,376
And you?

306
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,611
So sad

307
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:52,249
I broke up with my first love...

308
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,757
and married an uncultured cook

309
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:56,985
a cook...

310
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,360
Times have changed

311
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,899
All Chinese wanted to come to HK at that time

312
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:07,265
Wanted a Hong Kong identity Card

313
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:08,504
And I...

314
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,066
After a hard struggle

315
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:14,037
I got mine and I grew up

316
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,273
But I also got divorced

317
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:24,014
I don't think you dare get a divorce

318
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:31,725
Women like you are everywhere

319
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:36,196
Be glad you know me

320
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:42,138
otherwise... Second Wife in 5 years...

321
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:44,207
Third Wife in 10 years...

322
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:48,579
and Fourth Wife in 15

323
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:52,207
and I am different from you

324
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:53,577
I rely on myself

325
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,318
You may be rich, but I am free

326
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:07,428
At the shore is my home

327
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:16,298
Mrs. Lee, go cast your net

328
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,735
Mrs. Lee!

329
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:28,717
Return loaded with fish

330
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,654
Thanks, Aunt Mei You're welcome; bye

331
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:43,690
Hello? Not yet, Mrs. Lee

332
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:47,428
Money can't buy it; just like love

333
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,539
The prime material is rare

334
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,300
All right; bye

335
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:09,425
What is this place?

336
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:43,221
Relax...

337
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,220
Almost done

338
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:16,459
Relax...

339
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:29,304
relax

340
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:37,812
I'll be done soon

341
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:57,224
It's been eighteen hours

342
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:58,763
Relax

343
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:03,064
You must relax, too

344
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,805
Will she be all right?

345
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:06,636
Don't worry

346
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,774
Relax

347
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:12,905
The vagina is not fully dilated yet

348
00:41:13,384 --> 00:41:15,852
She still has the body of girl

349
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:22,519
We women must defend ourselves...

350
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,160
or they will bully us

351
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:27,858
Take care of your daughter...

352
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:29,657
so it doesn't happen again

353
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,633
The water broke

354
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:44,072
It's fine Don't be nervous

355
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:48,477
I swear it will be over in ten seconds

356
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,117
Deep breath

357
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:55,049
Work with me, relax... Hold on

358
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:03,495
Relax! Cry if you want to

359
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:07,402
It's fully dilated, don't worry

360
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:10,730
One, two, three

361
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:16,274
The head is out... wait!

362
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:18,813
Where are my tongs?

363
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,276
Relax...

364
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,588
relax

365
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:43,770
Beautiful

366
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:46,805
Don't be sad

367
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:49,377
The baby has no more life

368
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:53,244
So fresh

369
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:04,550
Little girl

370
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:06,887
Little girl, you'll be fine

371
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:08,823
You'll be fine

372
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,729
It's over. Little girl

373
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,936
Lie down on my couch

374
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:21,273
Easy

375
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:24,408
Thanks Take my shoes

376
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,714
Let me sing for you

377
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:31,913
She's so heavy

378
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:33,112
I can't hold her much longer

379
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:34,421
Wait

380
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:05,818
Mrs. Lee, help yourself

381
00:44:06,123 --> 00:44:07,818
I will make steamed dumplings

382
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:12,891
Have more wine

383
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:12,575
It was a boy

384
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:14,311
A boy?

385
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:28,786
See, look at that

386
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:33,862
So beautiful and rare

387
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:37,990
In China, people only abort girls

388
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:42,462
I didn't use drugs, just a catheter

389
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,665
Drugs make it inedible

390
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:47,944
They will damage its nervous system

391
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:50,273
It is also a first-born, even more nutritious

392
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,882
It's the most nutritious thing in the world

393
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,281
You saw the mother; nice girl

394
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,218
Young, still in high school

395
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:02,458
Healthy

396
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:06,321
Well, what are you waiting for?
What are you cooking today?

397
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:35,872
You'll feel like a new woman

398
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:16,809
My husband broke his leg

399
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:17,644
Now you need me

400
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:24,551
Normally you wouldn't care. Where I go

401
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:54,578
You smell nice...

402
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:00,716
Iook nice

403
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:04,854
You haven't held me in ages

404
00:53:15,772 --> 00:53:17,034
Thirsty?

405
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:19,233
I'll get water

406
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:12,999
It's so hot

407
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:17,012
And we must go to Mongkok next

408
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:19,546
I forgot about that

409
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,012
With two cases

410
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:23,379
Woe is me And they're huge

411
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:25,445
Oh?

412
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,324
What is it..."blood"! What is it?

413
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,984
You're joking

414
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,193
Here's a tissue Whose is it, Driver?

415
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:40,967
Kay? How are you feeling?

416
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:46,770
Kay? Answer me

417
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:52,244
Kay? Are you all right?

418
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:54,910
I don't want to die

419
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:06,624
Don't die, Kay!

420
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:10,891
It's all my fault!

421
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,300
It's a reasonable amount

422
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:56,064
I'm busy; my assistant Emily will follow up

423
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:59,101
Don't worry; bye!

424
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:03,041
Sheep placentas or longevity mushrooms?

425
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:04,339
Otherwise, it must be the Snow Lotus

426
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:08,280
I say a major facelift

427
01:00:10,787 --> 01:00:12,721
She's done something

428
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:14,686
Or eaten something

429
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:16,984
Mrs. Lee

430
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:20,455
You look great Thanks

431
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:22,387
Talking behind my back?

432
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:25,329
Of course not!
Just about how beautiful you look

433
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:26,659
Please wait for a moment

434
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:30,897
You're so late

435
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:33,504
Perhaps she finds herself a guru

436
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:37,043
I think "voodoo" is closer

437
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:40,642
What evil thoughts!

438
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:43,710
That's horrible

439
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:45,815
It is scary

440
01:00:47,557 --> 01:00:50,856
Please sit; you're the host

441
01:00:51,227 --> 01:00:53,127
You are the host

442
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:55,592
Please help yourselves Well

443
01:00:56,066 --> 01:00:58,330
The food smells fishy

444
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,900
Is it the beef? The beef?

445
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:05,041
Fishy, I don't eat fish

446
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,203
Is it the fish?

447
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:09,239
I don't think so

448
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,047
There is a strange smell

449
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:16,280
I smell it, too What's wrong?

450
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:22,022
It's not the fish

451
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:25,192
But it really stinks

452
01:01:25,862 --> 01:01:27,159
What's that?

453
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:29,228
It's coming from here

454
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:36,469
Excuse me

455
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,370
She's off again

456
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:44,375
Where is she going

457
01:01:44,514 --> 01:01:47,142
The smell is gone You're right

458
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:46,101
Aunt Mei?

459
01:02:47,277 --> 01:02:48,744
What is your "best stuff"

460
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:51,406
What did you feed me?

461
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:54,581
Was the fetus sick?

462
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:57,416
I smell fishy all over

463
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,644
What do you mean?

464
01:02:58,988 --> 01:03:01,923
I've eaten so much and I'm fine

465
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:05,519
If anything happens to me
I hold you responsible!

466
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:06,890
I'll sue you!

467
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,922
You'll sue me?

468
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:12,094
You're the cannibal

469
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,465
Don't be silly, Mrs. Lee.

470
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:20,308
It smells because it works; you're too sensitive

471
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:24,874
Look at the mirror tomorrow, you'll be grateful

472
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:29,376
What do I do?

473
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:32,113
What do I do?

474
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:40,223
This baby was hard to find

475
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:43,899
It was a child of an incest

476
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:45,500
One in a million, you know

477
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:46,961
You mean a true bastard?

478
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:49,663
This is because of the incest?

479
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:55,504
Incest makes it extra potent

480
01:03:57,313 --> 01:04:00,282
Hurry...

481
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:03,578
Turn your TV to Channel 2... it's your series

482
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,631
No Really?

483
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,863
The one you said looks like Alan

484
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:25,404
No way

485
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:33,705
Just admit it

486
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:37,477
No Really?

487
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:43,888
Sorry Never mind

488
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:53,428
Mrs. Lee, are you crying?

489
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:57,504
Don't cry; be strong

490
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,868
Have a good sleep

491
01:05:00,076 --> 01:05:01,168
Take a hot bath

492
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:03,311
Sip some vinegar; you'll be fine

493
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:06,039
Good night, Mrs. Lee

494
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:57,248
Coming...

495
01:07:01,431 --> 01:07:02,625
Aunt Mei?

496
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:05,092
Yes, Mr. Lee

497
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:14,371
You're breaking the law

498
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:19,670
How come?

499
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:23,514
This is just my dumpling shop

500
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:28,451
You advocate cannibalism

501
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:34,754
Does it really work?

502
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,565
Please sit

503
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:51,475
I will prove it to you

504
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:13,562
Please take a seat, Mr. Lee

505
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:27,977
We Chinese have had a long history

506
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:30,415
Who can tell if it is illegal to eat flesh?

507
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,286
About eating humans

508
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:35,684
Ancient medical texts say...

509
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:38,190
human flesh and organs...

510
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:41,023
can heal diseases

511
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:44,526
During famines

512
01:08:44,734 --> 01:08:47,100
People could not bear to eat their own children

513
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:50,498
So they traded and ate other people's children

514
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:55,803
An ancient chef heard that...

515
01:08:56,446 --> 01:09:00,610
...his Emperor wanted to taste human flesh

516
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,479
To please his Emperor...

517
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:06,417
...he cooked and served his own son
to the monarch

518
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:12,491
Tales abound of caring sons and daughters...

519
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:16,689
...cutting off flesh for their parents' medicines

520
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:21,027
In the Water Margin

521
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:26,172
Heroes ate human organs with their wine

522
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:30,237
One even opened a bun shop
using flesh as filling

523
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:38,011
The Japanese ate the Chinese

524
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:43,848
China had civil unrest and famines

525
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:45,493
Did they avoid human flesh?

526
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:51,225
We hate people "whole-heartedly"

527
01:09:53,803 --> 01:09:55,430
A patriotic poem describes...

528
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:57,800
"eating barbarian flesh...

529
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:01,835
drinking their blood"

530
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:07,575
We love people "with all our hearts"

531
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,944
We want to take bites...

532
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:13,649
and swallow them

533
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:18,755
We are inside each other

534
01:12:28,524 --> 01:12:31,755
You were 20 in 1960?

535
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:36,956
You're in your sixties now

536
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:44,570
Age is just a number

537
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,642
But you're an old lady

538
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:03,220
My body is what's real

539
01:13:03,492 --> 01:13:05,790
Feel it, harder

540
01:13:08,998 --> 01:13:11,262
Is it young enough?

541
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,292
You can be the same...

542
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:16,635
...stay young forever

543
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:20,674
Stay young forever by eating my dumplings

544
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:41,821
This is Mrs. Lee

545
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:43,988
Do you have any supply?

546
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:48,399
Money is not a problem

547
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:50,638
I need supplies...

548
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:23,367
Mr. Lee, will you return?

549
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,703
Yes, to eat your flesh

550
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:30,203
That's a promise I must go

551
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:35,249
Goodbye

552
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:44,749
I'll wait for you

553
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:54,099
I'll wait for you

554
01:15:04,513 --> 01:15:09,075
Aunt Mei!

555
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,480
Aunt Mei, it's me

556
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:35,693
Dizzy? And rashes?

557
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:37,395
It's just nerves!

558
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,900
You'll be fine after you move back home...

559
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,441
You'll be fine

560
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:47,415
I'll give you drugs to ease the itch

561
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:49,914
Hotel living is not for you

562
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:54,319
Nurse?

563
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:56,020
Yes, Dr. Wong

564
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:59,351
Mrs. Lee's driver will pick up her medication

565
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:01,562
Yes, how many days' prescription?

566
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:04,724
Give her a week Okay

567
01:17:35,497 --> 01:17:38,193
Mr. Lee's secretary called and asked

568
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,630
Why you skipped your ultrasound yesterday

569
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:44,301
I'm here now Here's your report

570
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,374
Call us if your morning sickness continues

571
01:17:46,642 --> 01:17:47,404
Thank you

572
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:48,668
Goodbye Bye

573
01:18:58,547 --> 01:18:59,707
Thank you

574
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:28,410
Aunt Mei

575
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:31,139
You scared me!

576
01:19:33,182 --> 01:19:35,173
I was rude...

577
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:39,949
But as a woman
you know what I was going through

578
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:42,451
I really need your help

579
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:45,588
I've retired

580
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:47,528
Money is not a problem

581
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:52,530
That "best stuff" was a dream

582
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:02,609
Mrs. Lee, don't try that

583
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:05,845
I beg you, I really need you

584
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:07,106
Please help

585
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:22,521
Mr. Lee, I am fixing my hair now

586
01:20:22,731 --> 01:20:24,995
I've been waiting for your call

587
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,333
I want to see you soon, too!

588
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:30,570
Okay, Bye!

589
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,048
Don't move

590
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:20,187
Dispatch, we're at 2103

591
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:24,188
Victim is male, badly cut up...
We need an ambulance

592
01:21:25,394 --> 01:21:28,454
We have the female under control

593
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,469
Tell them to hurry

594
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:50,246
Please tell the ambulance to hurry

595
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:45,996
What are these?

596
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:50,038
Must you scream? So much stuff left

597
01:23:42,631 --> 01:23:45,361
He's back with me

598
01:23:46,134 --> 01:23:49,262
I won't let go again

599
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:50,962
Give up

600
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,540
I've thought about it

601
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,704
But you're pregnant

602
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:04,883
He said he wanted a son

603
01:24:08,724 --> 01:24:09,884
And if it's a girl?

604
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:14,885
Then I charge less

605
01:24:16,298 --> 01:24:17,356
You're having the child?

606
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:22,198
I'm five months along

607
01:24:22,704 --> 01:24:25,104
I'm almost due

608
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:30,302
I'm young; the time is nothing

609
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,006
I can live on Mr. Lee's cheque...

610
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:37,918
...at least for a while

611
01:24:42,591 --> 01:24:44,081
I want your baby

612
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,496
Why? Inheritance issues?

613
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:52,991
I want your baby now

614
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:57,836
Now?

615
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:03,874
Abort it; You don't have to carry it

616
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:06,775
And I don't have to worry

617
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:16,181
I'll double your price

618
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:18,851
How's that?

619
01:25:40,048 --> 01:25:43,745
Doctor, she's in her second trimester

620
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:45,983
Don't let her miscarry

621
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:50,380
Do not use drugs to induce birth

622
01:25:51,259 --> 01:25:53,750
I don't want drugs in its system

623
01:25:54,729 --> 01:25:58,426
Use a catheter...

624
01:25:58,567 --> 01:26:01,764
...and adrenaline to stimulate the vagina

625
01:26:02,604 --> 01:26:05,835
Then the fetus will be perfect

626
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,403
Using this method will take longer

627
01:26:11,646 --> 01:26:15,013
And cause pain to the mother

628
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:18,446
The pain only lasts for a while

629
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:23,456
You want...

630
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:25,250
to keep this fetus?

631
01:26:25,427 --> 01:26:28,828
Yes, and in its pure form

632
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:33,660
Why do you want it?

633
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:38,638
Trophy, a souvenir

634
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:42,606
It's the world's most expensive trophy

635
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:46,645
Hurry, then

636
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:56,952
I want to watch

637
01:27:18,914 --> 01:27:23,408
Shenzhen, China

638
01:28:38,126 --> 01:28:39,753
Put three wishes...

639
01:28:40,061 --> 01:28:41,892
...in the music box

640
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:43,188
Your first wish?

641
01:28:43,398 --> 01:28:45,093
A man to love me all my life

642
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:47,562
And then?

643
01:28:47,802 --> 01:28:49,030
Happiness always

644
01:28:49,337 --> 01:28:52,602
What's the third? Hurry

645
01:28:52,807 --> 01:28:53,569
Youth and beauty

646
01:28:55,644 --> 01:28:59,876
Of course, beauty Hurry, it's our turn

647
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:04,007
Your wish of marriage is granted

648
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:06,554
Wait, greet my guests for me

649
01:29:06,788 --> 01:29:10,189
I left something Hurry, then
