They called this portal
the Ark.

00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,792
Keep your distance
from the core
or you might get sucked in.

175
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,454
You, uh, you done this before?

176
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,626
Once. Training mission.

177
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,799
Hope you had a good dinner,
Kid.

178
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,202
Inter-planet coordinate
lock engaged.

179
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,262
[electronic beeping]

180
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,400
All telemetry verified
and transmissions
are five-by-five.

181
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,241
Soon as we get through,
I need you to shut down
the surface elevator here.

182
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,543
Make sure that we get
the standard quarantine
of six hours.

183
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,345
Target receiver initialized.
Ready to proceed.

184
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,111
Ark travel,
15 seconds and counting.

185
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,254
[alarm sounding]

186
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,193
Five, four...

187
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,867
three, two...

188
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,627
one.

189
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,345
Why we gotta come
all this way?

190
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,847
Why can't UAC rent-a-cops
take care of this bullshit?

191
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,686
Is it always that rough?

192
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,159
Believe me,
it used to be a lot rougher.

193
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,258
There was a time when
Ark travel was susceptible
to, let's say...

194
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,130
major turbulence.
What's he mean?

195
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,194
He means he went
to one galaxy,
his ass went to another.

196
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,735
Call it
a scientific miscalculation.

197
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,543
Unbelievable as it may seem,
UAC does make
the odd tiny mistake.

198
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,250
Marcus Pinzerowsky.
You call me Pinky. Follow me.

199
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,144
(Sarge)
Where are the personnel who
aren't locked down in the lab?

200
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,210
In the atrium.

201
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,280
Pinky, put us up.

202
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,659
Activating remote personnel
surveillance.

203
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,494
[beeping]

204
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,292
Circle out men, on my three.

205
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,231
One, two, three.

206
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,467
Killcams up and running.

207
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,673
People, this room
is a code red, which means...

208
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,439
no one gets in
without our permission.

209
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,774
It stays ours at all costs.

210
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,213
Mac, stay here with our friend
and secure the door.

211
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,547
Men, on me. Let's move out.

212
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,018
Open the doors.

213
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,080
[hissing]

214
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,734
(man)
Who called in the military?

215
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,513
Where the fuck are we?

216
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,108
Couple million light years
from breakfast.

217
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,415
When can I start
evacuating people out
through the Ark?

218
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,887
We're at a Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.

219
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:22,223
Ladies, we're under
a Level 5 quarantine...

220
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,821
so I'm just gonna have to
strip search you girls.

221
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,890
(woman)
I don't think so.
(Portman)
Hold that thought.

222
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,028
We're under
a Level 5 quarantine,
so I'm just gonna have...

223
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,833
to strip--
(Sarge)
Portman!

224
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,739
Sergeant,
this is Dr. Samantha Grimm,
the UAC science officer...

225
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,902
assigned to retrieve data
from the lab.

226
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,037
Sergeant.
(Sarge)
Dr. Grimm.

227
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,547
(Samantha)
Hello, John.
Hello, Samantha.

228
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,049
Hello, Samantha!

229
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,851
(John)
Sarge,
this operation is a code red.

230
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,047
We really don't have room
for passengers.

231
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,580
Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data
from three servers:

232
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,924
Anthropology,
Forensic Archeology,
and Genetics.

233
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,224
This is a military operation,
Doctor.

234
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,358
We're really not here
to retrieve
your science homework.

235
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,200
Look, I got an idea.
Why don't you ask your CO
what your orders are?

236
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,672
To contain
and neutralize the threat,
protect the civilians...

237
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,578
and retrieve--
retrieve UAC property.

238
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,015
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.

239
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,946
(Samantha)
If you'll follow me?
You chose this, Reaper.

240
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,955
Is this gonna spoil my day?
No, sir.

241
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,186
Tell me you didn't let
a fine-looking piece of ass...

242
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,455
like that get away from you,
Reaper.
She's my sister.

243
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,520
No shit?
Don't do this again, man.

244
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,587
Do what?

245
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,534
There's three sections
to Carmack's lab complex.

246
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,036
Archeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.

247
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,072
You test weapons up here?
Well, it's a dead planet.

248
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,041
You want that stuff
tested here, where it's safe,
or in your own backyard?

249
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,577
We're primarily
an archeological operation.

250
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,113
Weapons Research is in
its own separate facility.

251
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,581
It has nothing to do
with Dr. Carmack's work.

252
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,311
How many inside
when the lab shut down?

253
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,979
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
That's six people.

254
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,956
In one of the carbon dating
labs, there was
an internal phone...

255
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,150
left off the hook.

256
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,489
Did you get any information
from it?

257
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,859
[woman shrieking]

258
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,695
[men screaming]

259
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,998
Open the door.

260
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,306
[continues beeping]

261
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,541
[beeping]

262
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,778
Portman, Goat, lead on.

263
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,418
[instrument beeping]

264
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,618
Magnesium, chromium, lead.
It's all normal.

265
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,025
All clear.

266
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,694
Pinky, give us a schematic.

267
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,533
Uploading to you now.

268
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,932
(Pinky)
Carmack's lab is isolated
from the rest of the facility.

269
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,177
The airlock is the only way
in or out.

270
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,051
Goat, Portman: Genetics.

271
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,213
Kid, Destroyer:
Carmack's office,
where he sent the mayday from.

272
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,086
Reaper, keep Dr. Grimm here
safe on her salvage op.

273
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,151
Duke and I'll take
the weapons lab, make sure
all the hardware's secure.

274
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,890
Be safe, gentlemen.

275
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,457
Portman, Goat, on you.
It's on.

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,900
[cocking guns]

277
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,335
[airlock hissing]

278
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,775
(Portman)
Clear left.
(Goat)
Clear right.

279
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,617
$5 says this shit ain't
nothing but a disgruntled
employee with a gun.

280
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,886
(Sarge)
Fluorescent markings
as rooms are cleared. Go.

281
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,798
[footsteps echoing]

282
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,597
They're on the move.

283
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,535
You don't look like a ''Mac.''

284
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,402
Katsuhiko Kumanosuke Takaashi.

285
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,502
So, Mac.

286
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,886
[bubbling]

287
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,826
What the fuck!

288
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,892
[door clanks shut]

289
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,839
[beeping]

290
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,379
[water bubbling]

291
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,519
Pinky, you getting this?

292
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,782
Jesus.

293
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,255
(Pinky)
Very cool.

294
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,229
[screeching]

295
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,099
[animals screeching]

296
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,734
[dog barking]

297
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,743
[beeps]

298
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,075
Cleared.

299
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,652
Where the hell is everybody?

300
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,483
(Destroyer)
Hey.

301
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,699
Lock in.

302
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,639
[beeping]

303
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,713
It's clear.

304
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,655
How much time you gonna need?

305
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,659
Thirty minutes, tops.

306
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,821
(Pinky)
Goat, Portman.

307
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,727
There's another room
to the north.

308
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,390
Past Genetics.

309
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,162
Copy that.

310
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,641
[static buzzing]

311
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,588
What the hell is that?
[laughing]
You never did time, Portman?

312
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,646
What?

313
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,695
This is a holding cell.
Bullshit.

314
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,127
What makes you think that?

315
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,057
Touch it.

316
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,235
[yelling in pain]

317
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,670
'Cause the walls
are electrified.
You asshole!

318
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,146
(Duke)
Jeez. They leave shit
like this lying around?

319
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,180
I'd hate to see
what they lock up.

320
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,789
''BFG.''

321
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,434
Hey, Sarge, what's the deal
with the sister?

322
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,408
Reaper's parents
led the first team
of archeologists to Olduvai.

323
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,108
They died in some accident
when he was a kid.

324
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,482
She followed in their
footsteps, and he didn't.

325
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,122
No, what I meant was,
is she single?

326
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,990
[beeping]

327
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,357
(female computer voice)
Please provide
DNA verification.

328
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,860
[beeps accelerating]

329
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,198
[buzzing]
Access denied.

330
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,371
All units report contact.

331
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,138
(Sarge)
God damn it,
all units report contact.

332
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,703
Hey.

333
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,377
It was moving.

334
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,047
(Destroyer)
Friendly fire, Sarge.
Wasting ghosts.

335
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,424
Roger that. Funny, Duke.

336
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,457
So, ''Reaper''? As in ''Grim''?

337
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,155
They're Marines, Sam,
not poets.

338
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,489
(John)
Holy shit!

339
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,068
Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.

340
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,831
Lucy, this is my brother,
John...

341
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,873
another creature
from the long lost past.

342
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,636
You found human remains?
Humanoid.

343
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,270
Lucy and her child
were our first major find.

344
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,473
We're bringing out more
every day.

345
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,717
You re-opened the dig?
I know I should have told you.

346
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,078
I didn't figure it was
the sort of thing...

347
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,647
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.

348
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,050
It's been stabilized.
Bullshit.

349
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,463
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?

350
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,158
I'm a forensic archeologist,
John. I'll go where
the work is.

351
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,328
Is that the only reason
you're up here?

352
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,395
You wanna know
why I'm up here?

353
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,137
I'll show you. Come here.

354
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,304
This is Lucy's chromosome
profile. Notice anything?

355
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,981
My molecular genetics
is a little rusty.

356
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,983
What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?

357
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,559
She's got 24 pairs
of chromosomes.

358
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,122
Humans only have 23.
But what does
the extra pair do?

359
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,793
Makes her superhuman.

360
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,995
The extra pair makes
her super strong...

361
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,505
super fit, super intelligent.

362
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,368
Her cells divide
50 times faster...

363
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,843
meaning she heals
almost instantly.

364
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,109
The fossil record
indicates these people
had conquered disease.

365
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,413
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.

366
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,011
[computer beeping]
So what, they were just
naturally superior?

367
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,147
No. Not naturally.

368
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,693
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.

369
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,226
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.

370
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,826
Bioengineered?

371
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,825
That's a long word
for a Marine.

372
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,962
Does it ever bother you...

373
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,062
you could've spent your life
looking in a microscope...

374
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,766
instead of a sniper scope?

375
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,244
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?

376
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,610
We don't know.

377
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,644
Maybe they just went
with time.

378
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,050
You don't shield a baby
from time.

379
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,187
(Goat)
We got movement up ahead.

380
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,791
You stay here, okay?
Lock the door.

00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,023
[footsteps clattering]

382
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,567
(Sarge)
Fucking door has
been ripped open.

383
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,570
There's something
in Carmack's office.

387
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,063
Contact!

388
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,971
(Goat on radio)
Moving east through
Carmack's office! Fast!

389
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,008
(Sarge)
Confirmed contact. Moving
fast, over south corridor.

390
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,979
Hold your fire!

391
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,894
If you have a weapon, drop it.

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,426

Don't move.

[shivering]

395
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,343
Sam, I told you to stay--
But he knows me, John.

396
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,578
Dr. Carmack, it's me.
Samantha.

397
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,553
Where are the others?
Where are they?

398
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,454
Steve, Hillary....

399
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,188
I'm not gonna hurt you.

400
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,326
I'm not gonna hurt you.

401
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,161
Ah!

402
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,328
[ripping]

403
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,530
Jesus Christ!

404
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,937
(Portman)
Oh, damn.
Get a med kit.

405
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,133
[Portman laughing]
Nice.

406
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,635
[Carmack groaning]
I'm not gonna hurt you.

407
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,679
Duke, get him to the infirmary
with Dr. Grimm.

408
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,738
Portman, Kid, go to
the airlock and dig in.

409
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,978
Anything trying to get away
from us will get driven
straight to you.

410
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:15,352
Now let's see
if we can find the body
that goes with that arm.

411
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,262
(Portman)
It's messed up, huh?

412
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,925
Guy like Carmack...

413
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,198
who's trained to put logic
before emotion...

414
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,104
he's so freaked, huh...

415
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,576
he tears off his own ear?

416
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,176
I tell you, man.

417
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,381
It's shit like that
that gets under your skin.

418
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,248
Do you....

419
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,535
Do you have any?
Do I have any?

420
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,096
[snickering]

421
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,630
What?

422
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,234
You know.

423
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,343
I'm just a little shook up.

424
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,350
I need something
to get my focus, man.

425
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,613
[sighing]
My game face.

426

I took His name in vain.

00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,803
Shit.

434
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,420
There is a God.

Ma'am.

Excuse me, ma'am.

I think we found
the rest of that arm.

No, no.

No, no, I don't do nanowalls.
Yes, you do.

446
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,551
You got him? Wait here.

447
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,281
Shit.

You okay?

451
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,481
Did they find the others?
Not yet.

452
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,882
My husband is with them.

453
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,983
I'm sure Steve's fine.

454
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,557
Dr. Carmack, I'm going to
take your blood pressure.

455
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,162
Hey--
It's okay, it's okay.

456
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,869
I can feel it.
What happened in there?

457
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,805

Shut it, shut it down.
Shut it down.

We heard something
in Genetics.

462
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,118
We're re-entering.

463
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,684
(Sarge)
That's affirmative, Reaper.

464
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,932
Looks like
we missed the party.

465
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,732

We were just here.

466
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,833

Okay.

We found another
one of the scientists.

(John)
Some weird shit
going on here, Sarge.

480
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,828
Can you ID him?
We got a Dr. Olsen.

481
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,255
He rushed us. Crazy.
Just like Carmack.

482
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,597
Is he dead?
Yeah, very.

483
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,103
Should we bag him and tag him?
Negative.

484
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,264
Continue your search.

Reaper, what have you got?
We're chasing something.

What do you mean, something?
Something big, not human.

Give me a confirmation
on what you're seeing.

It's in the sewer.

You should go.

I want to stay.
Steve is gonna be okay.

516
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,393
The guys looking for him
are the best.

Tunnel ahead

It leads back

Destroyer, cover the exit.

531
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,989
We got a Dr. Willits.

Shut up.

Small world. I mean,
I lost my parents, too.

565
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,791
Yeah, I mean,
I woke up one morning...

you open your mouth...

you give away our position.

Empathetic, sensitive.

706
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,385
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Reaper as sensitive.

707
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:51,617
I knew Reaper before all the
''drop down and give me 50,
woo-ha'' stuff.

708
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,890
Yeah?

709
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,866
Well, it's hua....
Hua.

710
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,299
Yeah.

711
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,298
Do you have a family?

712
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,500
I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.

713
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,575
You know, Duke, I bet
secretly you have a big heart.

714
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,907
Oh, yeah?

715
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,483
And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.

716
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,710
Little rusty, huh?

717
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,517
Oh, lady,
you have no idea.

718
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,458
Right now, having sex
with me is practically
your civic duty.

719
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,256
[Sam groaning]

720
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,589
I need a power bone saw.

721
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,691
A power bone saw?

722
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,502
Girl, I've been waiting
on you my whole life.

723
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,904
There's one
in the procedure room.

724
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,100
Down the corridor,
on the left,
through the nanowall.

725
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,010
Through the nanowall?

726
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,944
All right,
I got it. It's cool.

727
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:50,349
For you I got it,
'cause you're pretty.

728
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,444
Cool.

729
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,818
I wouldn't do it for a dude,
you know.

730
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,117
Off you go.

731
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,854
We're going back in
through the airlock.

732
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,227
We're not calling in backup?

733
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,365
The Ark is sealed.

734
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:05,959
Nothing gets back...

735
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,061
until everything
on this planet is dead.

736
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,105
We're going in hot.

737
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,104
You're serious.

738
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,132
Pick up your weapon, Portman.

739
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,906
Come on, Portman, move out.

740
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,243
Didn't y'all see
how that thing greased Goat?

741
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,540
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

742
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,017
It's SOP to call in
reinforcements...

743
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,054
when a situation--

744
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,111
We are...

745
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,524
the reinforcements.

746
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,233
Now, you shoulder...

747
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,435
your fucking weapon, soldier.

748
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,145
All UAC personnel
evacuated to Earth.

749
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,314
[beeping]

750
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,218

752
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,763
Duke?

753
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,570
[beeping]

754
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,255
Duke?

755
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:47,792
Duke!

756
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,230
[screaming]

757
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,969
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a power shortage.

758
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,265
You okay?

759
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,470
Here's your bone saw.

760
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,846
So, which of you
is the oldest?

761
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,974
What?

762
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:03,710
Oh, me. By two minutes.

763
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,117
Twins? Shit.

764
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,954
[growling]
Identical, right?

765
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,582
[gasping]

766
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,118

[snarling]

768
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,328
Sam, get back in the lab.

769
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,730
[barking]

770
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,170

[Duke grunting]

776
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,311
Shit.

777
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,358
[gun firing]

778
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,414

[screaming]

780
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,318
Motherfucker!

781
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,288
Close it!

782
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,263
[screeching]

783
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,203
And that's why
I don't do nanowalls.

784
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,339
(John)
Pinky, we're entering
the archeological dig.

785
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,885
[mice squeaking]

786
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:15,952
Secure the exit.

787
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,192
[creature growling]

788
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,132

789
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,111
(John)
(Samantha) Sam.
I'm coming.

790
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,010
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

791
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,648
[both laughing]

792
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,194
(Samantha)
Come on. Come on.

793
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,027
(mother)
Careful now.
(father)
Not too close, John.

794
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,434
(John)
Go, go, go.

795
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,734
(mother)
Slow down.

796
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,103
Go around. Go around again.

797
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,369
No! Mommy!

798
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,139
[explosion]

799
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,807
[crying]

800
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,247
Is this where it happened?

801
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,514
Did you find the door?

802
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,759
(Sarge)
John?

803
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,202
[footsteps approaching]

804
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,965

[panting]

808
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,780
Look at them.

809
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,447
They weren't trying to stop
something from getting in.

810
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,757
Something stopped them
from getting out.

811
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,521
(John)
Mac, stand by.

812
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,752
Destroyer, report.

813
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,355
We've reached
the north airlock.

814
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:37,559
It's secure.

815
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,728
Console indicates nothing's
come in or out for 26 hours.

816
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,564
[creature growling]

817
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,730
Mac?

818
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,066
Mac.

819
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,909
Mac, Mac, you copy?

820
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,582
Talk to me. Talk to me, Mac.

821
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,044
Shit.

(Mac)
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.

826
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,969
(Sarge)
It's getting away.

827
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,537
Pinky, what do you see?

828
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,665
It's big. Very big.

829
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,340
Moving fast,
back towards the lab complex.

830
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,503
Clear.

831
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,941
It's back in the lab.

832
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:31,948
[gun clicking]

833
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,312
Clear!

834
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,447
Clear.

835
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,692
Damn, it's fast.

836
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,960
All around defense, men.

837
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,327
Did you get it?

838
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,058
Pinky.
Yes, Sarge?

839
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,329
Anything gets through
that door...

840
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,370
use an ST grenade.

841
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,268
(Sarge)
It cannot get back to Earth.

842
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,238
He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.

843
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,504
Reaper, Kid, pairs,
cover formation.

844
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,273
Sweep the corridors. Go.

845
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,878
Destroyer, you and Portman
stay here. Shut the airlock.

846
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,110
Maintain a perimeter.

847
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,345
He blows the Ark,
how the hell...

848
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,853
are we supposed to
get the fuck home?

849
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,014
Portman,
shut the fucking door.

850
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,655
Where you going?

851
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,515
I'm going to the armory.

852
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,785
I think we're gonna
need something...

853
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,420
with a little bit more kick.

854
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,800

You see
anything like it before?

Kidneys.

864
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,696
Dogs got kidneys, right?

865
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,368
Pigs got kidneys.

866
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,180
It's had its appendix removed.

867
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,042
It's human.

868
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,283

Goat knew he was turning.

874

This thing
didn't butcher Willits.

875
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,910
It is Willits.

876
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,569
What?

877
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,046
This is bullshit, man.

878
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,155

01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:09,352
Portman, I got floor and wall
on your gun cam.

891
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,284
I'm taking a shit,
you fucking gimp.

892
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,525
Fuck you, Portman,
you piece of shit.

893
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,129
[clicking]

894
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:28,871
[snarling]

895
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,173
[screaming]

896
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,576
[screaming]

897
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,456
Lost Portman on comm...

898
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,497
and all I've got on Destroyer
is a wall.

899
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,031
Portman, come in.

900
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,659
Destroyer.

901
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,225
Come in.

902
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,412
[grunting]

903
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:18,883
This is Corporal
Dean Portman...

904
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,590
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

905
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,828
We have encountered
hostile activity.

906
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,802
[creature roaring]

907
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,683
[grunting]

908
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,560
[screaming]

909
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,099
[roaring]

910
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:16,640
[gurgling]

911
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,858
[creature growling]

912
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,076
[screaming]

913
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:59,423
I repeat, require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

914
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,426
[thumping]

915
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,830
[metallic rattling]

916
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:31,456
Destroyer, Portman,
where the hell are you?

917
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:42,434
Shit.

918
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,885
[snarling]

919
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,351
[door creaking]

920
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,429
[mouse squeaking]

921
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:22,826
Shit.

922
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:25,974
[laughing]

923
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,031
[screaming]

924
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,911
(Portman)
Oh, God! Jesus!

925
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,242
Hmm.

926
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,913
[screaming]

927
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,059
Pinky, you got Portman?
No.

928
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,513
Holy shit.

929
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,806
[wires crackling]

930
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,189
He's gone.

931
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:24,994
[growling]

932
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,029
Destroyer?

933
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,465
And Portman.

934
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,870
What the fuck happened, man?

935
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,465
I got him, I got him.

936
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,336
Destroyer, I got you, man.

937
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,678
What's up, man?

938
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,819
[growling]

939
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,159
What the hell is this?

940
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,695
And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?

941
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:54,751
Goat's.

942
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,592
He killed himself.

943
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,794
What do you mean,
he killed himself?
He was already dead.

944
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,629
It's true.
It's Goat.

945
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:07,531
He was changing into
one of these motherfuckers
and he killed himself.

946
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,976
We found two more scientists
at the dig.

947
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,941
Thurman and a balding guy
with glasses.

948
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,345
Dr. Clay.

949
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,577
(Samantha)
Did you check their necks?

950
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,382
Were there open wounds
on their necks?

951
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,821
We were conducting
a firefight, not an autopsy.

952
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,689
(Sarge)
We came up here to find
six scientists.

953
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,159
Four are known dead...

954
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:29,662
and Dr. Willits is
probably KlA somewhere
down in that sewer.

955
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,924
The only one missing
is Dr. Carmack.

956
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,094
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?

957
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,632
Oh, he's shown up all right.

958
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,130
Look at the left ear.

959
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,942
[grunting]

960
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,949
Son of a bitch.

961
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,043
I think this other one
is Steve Willits.

962
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,918
I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his
med records.

963
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,650
What are you people
working on up here?

964
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,318
(Samantha)
We're analyzing bones,
artifacts.

965
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,123
We're not doing
anything like this.

966
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,925
Then what the fuck is that?

967
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:06,263
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental
or viral.

968
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:07,763
I don't know.

969
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,333
It may even be reversible.

970
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,731
It's irreversible.

971
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:13,172
(Samantha)
Not necessarily.

972
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,937
Dr. Carmack's condition...

973
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,510
is irreversible...

974
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,408
[grunting]

975
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,509
[creature growling]
No!

976
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:22,573
[gun firing]

977
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,115
because Carmack's condition
is that...

978
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:27,380
he's dead.

979
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,458
Kid, you and Duke...

980
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,088
get back to the dig
and you make sure
those other dead scientists...

981
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,528
are really dead.

982
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,432
I've lost...

983
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,697
four soldiers.

984
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:50,745
What are you people
experimenting with up here?

985
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,640
I'm not gonna ask you again.

986
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,950
I told you,
it's an archeological
research center.

987
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,983
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?

988
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,658
You think
I'm hiding something?

989
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,893
I'm telling the truth.

990
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,002
What were you downloading?

991
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,010
What were you sent to protect?

992
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,537
The research data.

993
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,378
Research into what?

994
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,720
(Dr. Carmack)
Subject was injected
with study agent at 00.:03.

995
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:41,661
[Curtis groaning]

996
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:46,699
Vitals normal, elevated
heart rate attributable
to subject anxiety.

997
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:47,793
[Curtis screaming]

998
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,637
C-24 successfully grafted to
subject's marker cells
at 00.:09.

999
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,905
He reconstructed chromosome
mutation on a human subject.

1000
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,274
We were never gonna do
human studies.

1001
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,709
What the hell
are we looking at?

1002
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,347
[sighing]

1003
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,980
Genesis, Chapter 1 .

1004
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:12,083
(Dr. Carmack)
Subject moved to protected
observation area at 00.:17.

1005
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,028
Subject.: Curtis Stahl.

1006
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,600
Crime.: Multiple murder.

1007
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,875
Status.:
Condemned to execution.

1008
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,342
[grunting]

1009
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,813
Chromosome 24.

1010
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:43,847
Oh, my God.

1011
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,825
49 minutes after injection,
genetic mutations...

1012
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:51,627
began to visually manifest on
subject's extremities.

1013
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,836
[Curtis screaming]

1014
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,339
This is what you're
here to protect.

1015
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,280
It doesn't make any sense.

1016
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,509
You trusted them.
They lied to you.

1017
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,118
They used you, Sam.

1018
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,712
If he perfected xenogenesis--

1019
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,950
Christ, don't you get it?

1020
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,618
It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.

1021
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,991
This shit ends here.

1022
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,166
What are you doing?

1023
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,999
We need to destroy
these discs.

1024
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,595
That's UAC property.

1025
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,608
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just--

1026
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,934
We take the data back.

1027
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,438
Sarge, do you not see
what's going on here?
I didn't see shit.

1028
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,550
And I ain't paid to see shit.

1029
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,479
I have my orders.
And so do you.

1030
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,657
Is this everything?

1031
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,519
I said, is this everything?

1032
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,160
I, uh, have three
more to download.
Then do it.

1033
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:05,901
[gun firing]

1034
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:11,868
(Kid)
Sarge?

1035
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:13,905
We got a problem.

1036
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,041
(Kid on radio)
One dead scientist is missing.

1037
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:17,908
Now.

1038
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,390
You just wanna leave her here?

1039
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,350
She's got a job to do.

1040
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:31,662
Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help,
okay?

1041
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,967
You gonna be all right?

1042
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,334
I'll be fine.

1043
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,440
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1044
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,907
(Sarge on radio)
Pinky, are you there? Pinky.

1045
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,612
Sarge? Something is cutting
through the Ark door.

1046
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,119
You have a visual?

1047
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,551
(Pinky)
Oh, I got a visual all right.

1048
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,588
Don't let it get to the Ark!

1049
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,184
(female computer voice)
Five.

1050
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,853
Pinky, use the grenade!
Four.

1051
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,725
Use the goddamn grenade!
Three, two.

1052
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,565
Throw it!
One.

1053
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,145
(Sarge)
Pinky's gone. That fucker ran.

1054
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,208
Shit.

1055
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,751
It got through.

1056
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,551
What the hell is that?

1057
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,989
(computer voice)
System reboot.

1058
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:33,755
Time required to begin
renewed operation.:
five minutes.

1059
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,387
Quarantine cordon is breached.

1060
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,432
This mission is
no longer containment.

1061
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,865
Get all the weapons and ammo
you can. We're going through.

1062
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:40,924
Move!

1063
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:42,570
Sam, come in. Over.

1064
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,799
Sam, do you read me? Over.
Come in!

1065
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,698
She's not answering.

1066
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,907
Time required to begin
renewed operation...

1067
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:52,378
four minutes and 45 seconds.

1068
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:53,943
You got three.

1069
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,652
Sam! Come in, Sam!

1070
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:15,961
Sam!

1071
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,230
Sam, why didn't you answer
your comm? We gotta go now!

1072
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,138
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?

1073
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,176
Why Carmack
and not Dr. Thurman?

1074
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,235
What?
Lucy had
the 24th chromosome...

1075
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,302
but she wasn't a monster.

1076
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,508
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.

1077
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:31,250
Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...

1078
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,185
turn Stahl into a monster?

1079
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,189
Let's go.
Just give me a minute.

1080
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,124
We don't have a minute.
Then give me 10 seconds.

1081
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,329
This is its tongue.

1082
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:45,099
This is brain matter
from Portman.

1083
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,431
[hissing]

1084
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,099
This is from Destroyer.

1085
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,475
It's choosing, John.

1086
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,242
It's choosing who to infect.

1087
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,818
It's choosing?
How is it choosing?

1088
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:10,380
There are genetic markers
for psychotic
and violent behavior.

1089
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,388
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...

1090
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,589
it's picking up on,
a ganglion.

1091
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,195
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to--

1092
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,996
Linked to what? Evil?

1093
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,729
Ten percent of the human
genome is still unmapped.

1094
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,638
Some say it's the genetic
blueprint for the soul.

1095
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:30,235
Maybe C-24 is what destroyed
the population.

1096
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:33,343
It would explain
why some of them
had to build the Ark...

1097
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,315
to escape to a new beginning.

1098
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:39,751
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.

1099
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,250
Oh, my God.

1100
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,519
We gotta get out of here now.
What?

1101
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,619
Come on, let's go, come on.

1102
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,921
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...

1103
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,329
they won't all be infected!

1104
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,765
What's going on?

1105
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,861
Sarge is going to
kill them all. Come on.

1106
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:02,703
We uphold quarantine.
Nothing gets to the elevator
back on Earth.

1107
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,803
We can't let them
get to the surface.

1108
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,973
If it breathes, kill it.
(female computer voice)
Five...

1109
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,516
four, three...

1110
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,419
two, one.

1111
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:18,823
[coughing]

1112
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,522
Ark travel complete.

1113
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,733
This is
Corporal Dean Portman...

1114
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:28,929
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

1115
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,233
We have encountered
hostile activity.

1116
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:36,106
Require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

1117
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,003
Yeah, no shit.

1118
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,743
We got 58 minutes before
the auto lockdown is lifted.

1119
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,241
Reset it
for another six hours.

1120
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,150
(Duke)
I can't. It's been disabled.

1121
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:48,388
Same as the topside comm link.

1122
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:50,015
They're disabling
computers now?

1123
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,287
Yeah,
they're rocket scientists,
remember?

1124
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,197
[gun firing]

1125
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:08,836
[gun firing]

1126
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:46,903
[growling]

1127
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:04,857
(woman on PA)
Ark travel complete.

1128
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:06,459
(John)
Oh, my God.

1129
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,562
Sarge,
what's your position?

1130
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,631
[screaming]

1131
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:23,373
Sarge.

1132
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,749
Sarge, come in.
Do you copy?

1133
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:28,251
Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.

1134
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,915
Sarge, come in,
do you copy?

1135
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,715
Loud and clear.

1136
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,226
(John on radio)
Look, do not kill everybody.

1137
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,126
I repeat,
do not kill everybody.

1138
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,528
Help me.
They're not all infected.

1139
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,896
Help me, help me, please.
Do you copy?

1140
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,531
Copy that.
(man)
Help me.

1141
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,092
[gun firing]

1142
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,068
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back
at the Ark chamber.

1143
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,191
[gun firing]

1144
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,792
(Pinky)
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are--

1145
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,303
Who the hell's in there?

1146
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:21,297
Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch.
Help me up.

1147
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,579
[baby crying]

1148
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,271
It's okay.

1149
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:39,782
Please...

1150
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,457
help us.

1151
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,828
(Samantha)
You don't have to
kill all of them.

1152
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:52,733
I don't think everyone
is infected, or even capable
of being infected.

1153
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:57,675
We have orders
to contain this threat
by any means necessary.

1154
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,180
(John)
So let's evacuate
the uninfected...

1155
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,214
and blow this place to hell.

1156
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,218
And we have orders
to protect this facility.

1157
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,481
We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.

1158
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,760
(Sarge)
We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...

1159
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,628
by any means...

1160
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,255
necessary.

1161
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,327
Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile
of dead bodies.

1162
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,961
Am I glad to see you guys.

1163
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:25,199
That thing
cut right through the door.

1164
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,333
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.

1165
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,308
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.

1166
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,005
It was horrible.

1167
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:37,483
There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.

1168
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,813
I say who's clean...

1169
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,493
and who's not.

1170
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,990
[gun cocking]
I mean, it wasn't my fault.

1171
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:52,795
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me--

1172
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:53,856
(Kid)
Sarge.

1173
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,764
There's a storeroom
to the south.

1174
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,274
It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.

1175
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,935
We gotta do something.

1176
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:06,376
Your orders were
to clear that sector.

1177
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,078
Is it cleared?

1178
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:11,515
No, I told them to stay put.

1179
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,421
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.

1180
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,049
We kill them all.

1181
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,020
Let God sort them out.

1182
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:24,893
This is wrong.

1183
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,427
I think--
Son, you don't think.

1184
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,303
That's an order.

1185
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,039
We're in the field, soldier.

1186
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,871
Sarge,
if nothing's found them--

1187
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:40,711
You will obey
the direct order...

1188
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,414
of your commanding officer.

1189
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:53,620
No.

1190
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:57,724
Now.

1191
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:00,960
Go to hell.

1192
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,833
[gun firing]
No!

1193
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,163
No.
Holy shit.

1194
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:19,212
(Sarge)
Mutinous insurrection
is punishable...

1195
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:21,744
by death.

1196
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:29,458
It was his first mission!
And it's not gonna be
my last.

1197
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,264
(Sarge)
I need soldiers.

1198
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,592
I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.

1199
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,337
(Pinky)
Drop the weapons.

1200
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:12,831
I mean it.

1201
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:16,904
I have no intention
of being killed by a madman.
Drop the weapons.

1202
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,746
[snarling]

1203
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:23,849
Ah, there's something
behind me, isn't there?

1204
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:25,215
[creature growling]

1205
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,947
[Pinky screaming]

1206
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,287
[gun firing]

1207
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:38,754
On me.

1208
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:41,935
[machine gun firing]

1209
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:43,993
Get Sam.

1210
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,748
Wait here.

1211
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,059
Listen.

1212
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:23,868
[screeching]

1213
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,378
[machine gun firing]

1214
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,481
Withdraw!
Withdraw behind the nanowall.

1215
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,952
Move!
I can't see. I can't see.

1216
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:36,147
[machine gun firing]

1217
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:45,655
Move.

1218
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:53,370
Clear!

1219
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:59,705
Fuck! The walI's not closing!

1220
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:05,441
[screaming]

1221
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:09,545
[screaming]

1222
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,221
[Duke groaning]

1223
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:17,887
[screaming]

1224
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,741
I'm not supposed to die.

1225
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:31,167
Let's go.

1226
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:33,002
[groaning]

1227
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,782
Come on.

1228
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:39,875
Clear.

1229
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,384
How long
before they get through?

1230
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:47,984
Not long.

1231
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,221
(Samantha)
You've been hit.

1232
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:52,995
Oh, John.

1233
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,041
Listen to me, Sam.

1234
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:14,252
You're cold. Shivering.

1235
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,354
It's important.

1236
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,892
This is an ST grenade.

1237
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,425
When they come through...

1238
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,160
you pop the top
and hit the button.

1239
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,473
John, stay with me.
Stay awake.

1240
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:36,800

What's that?

1243
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:48,419
It's C-24.
It's from Carmack's lab.
No.

1244
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:51,387
It could save you.
No way, forget it.

1245
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,722
You're bleeding to death.

1246
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,994
No way, Sam.

1247
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,463
I've done some bad things.

1248
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:07,238

Wait.

1253
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:25,448
Wait.

1254
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:29,697

one of those demons.

1255
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,728

1256
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,463
don't you hesitate. Okay?

1257
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,002

Are you gonna shoot me?
Yeah, I was thinking about it.
