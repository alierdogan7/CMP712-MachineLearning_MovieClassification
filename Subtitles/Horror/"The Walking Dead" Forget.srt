Sasha: He has a camp he wants
us to audition for membership.

00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:08,998
Rick Grimes: What
is this place?

4
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:11,117
Deanna Monroe: This is the
start of sustainability.

5
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:14,204
We need people who've
lived out there.

6
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:17,507
Deanna Monroe: They're still
your guns, but inside here, we

7
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:19,125
store them for safety.

8
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,678
Rick: Everybody said
you gave them jobs.

9
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:23,179
Deanna Monroe: Yeah,
that's part of this place.

10
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:24,847
Carol Peletier: This place
is gonna make us weak.

11
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,849
Rick Grimes: We'll
make it work.

12
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:29,469
If they can't make it, then
we'll just take this place.

15
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,776
No, no, it's cool.
I'm usually up.

16
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,778
I used to open for a coffee shop

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,447
every day for seven years.

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,200
Your brain, it gets wired

19
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,369
to things you don't
need anymore.

20
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,872
I still like carrying
around my cell phone, too.

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,874
One of these days
it's gonna ring

22
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,843
and freak my ass out.

23
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,096
Hey, if you happen to bag a boar
out there, can I have a leg?

24
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,516
To make a prosciutto.

25
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:36,936
I used to cure meats in my
basement even before all this.

26
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:39,355
I made some kick-ass
pickles, too.

27
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:40,940
Sure, Olivia.

28
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,231

We won't be here long.

45
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,692
So what do you think?

46
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:31,977
We can go in when it's empty.

47
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,979
How is that?
It's locked up at night.

48
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,365
The window. There's just a latch.
I can leave it open.

49
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,985
- A latch?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,787
What if one of those
pricks shuts it?

51
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,656
Wait a couple of days,
leave it open again.

52
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,658
- <i> (walker snarling)</i>
- It's getting closer.

53
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
We need to do it
sooner than later.

54
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,162
Right now,
they're not watching us.

55
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,831
Not worrying about
meetings like this.

56
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,167
We may need the guns,
we may not.

57
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,252
We will whatever way it goes.

58
00:04:57,254 --> 00:05:00,338
They're the luckiest
damn people I ever met.

59
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,174
And they just keep
getting luckier.

60
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,592
How's that?

61
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,510
We're here now.

62
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,399
They've got a couple
of footlockers

63
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:13,602
just full of 9 millimeter
autos, Rugers, Kel-Tecs.

64
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,021
Just tossed in there.
They don't use them.

65
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,406
They're never gonna know
they're gone.

66
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:20,075
Someone's got one now, right?

67
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,361
Mmm.

68
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:27,199
Listen, the others,
we want them to try.

69
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,667
You, too.

70
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,621
So we keep it quiet.
Just us.

- <i> (walker snarling)</i>
- Here it comes.

72
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,292
- I got him.
- Hey, wait.

73
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,806
We said we were
taking me out shooting.

74
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,607
I couldn't go back
with a full mag.

75
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:55,060
Lucky he came by.

76
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,978
We should get back.

77
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:01,566
You'll pull the latch,
we'll pick our moment.

78
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,202
Us, we don't need to be lucky.

79
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,372

(sighs)

84
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,673
I don't know if this
is some kind of play,

85
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,376
handing authority to strangers.

86
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,129
The authority
to break up fistfights.

87
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:07,299
If it was just that, she should
have given one of these to Daryl.

88
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:11,803
I don't know if it's
for us or for them.

89
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:15,891
Or maybe Deanna's trying
to get rid of us and them.

90
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,477
You put these jackets
on me and you,

91
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,063
have the people see it.

92
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,533
If that's the play,
that'd be smart.

93
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,236
And she seems smart.

94
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:32,290
Smart for then or smart for now?

95
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,044

98
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:54,179
Now!

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,110
You can tell the difference between
walkers and humans by sound?

100
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:18,036
Can you tell the difference
between a good guy and a bad guy?

101
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,673
Rick doesn't seem
to be an expert at that.

102
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,541
There ain't much
of a difference no more.

103
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:24,876
That how you feel
about your people?

104
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,212
Why you following me?

105
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,798
I didn't know I was.

106
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,217
I came out to hunt rabbits.

107
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,554
I know why you're out here.

108
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,358
Mind if I join?

109
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,898
Keep up.

110
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,950
And keep quiet.

111
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,456
Deanna:
<i>You protect and serve.</i>

112
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,709
You patrol, walk the wall,
watch out for the kids.

113
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,712
If there's a conflict,
you solve it.

114
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,164
And people will listen to you.

115
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,883
Because we're wearing
windbreakers?

116
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,218
Because they believe in this.

117
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,721
Because I'm telling them to.

118
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:13,675
A police officer
used to live here.

119
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:17,429
So we had these jackets and I
wanted to make it official.

120
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,147
So it's official.

121
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,933
There's gonna be a
government here one day.

122
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:25,520
That's why I want
Maggie working with me.

123
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,855
<i>There's gonna be a police force.</i>

124
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,940
<i>That's why I want</i>
<i>you two to start it.</i>

125
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:31,660
I see a vibrant community here

126
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:35,080
with industry, commerce,

127
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,365
civilization.

128
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,618
Real lives.

129
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,172
It might be horses
and mills, but... what?

130
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:47,008
Does that sound like
pie in the sky?

131
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,843
No.

132
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,047
No.

133
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,768
No.

134
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,687
Can we talk security?

135
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:01,890
We need a constant patrol
along the walls.

136
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,476
Not just looking for damage,

137
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,611
but signs that anyone
climbed in from outside.

138
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,067
You can move
right up the supports.

139
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,569
That's what I'd do.

140
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,371
People are the real threat now.

141
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:19,824
Rick, I know you think that we should
all be armed within the walls.

142
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,660
I... I can't do that.

143
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:26,297
That's fine.

144
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,084
You make these changes,
we won't need to.

145
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,419
Sasha:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

146
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:38,343
I want to volunteer to be one of
the lookouts in the clock tower.

147
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,428
There are no lookouts
in the clock tower.

148
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,764
- What?
- We saw someone up there earlier.

149
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:46,401
That was an empty rifle
my son Spencer put up there.

150
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:49,487
He mans it sometimes,
but not often.

151
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:52,857
Look, there hasn't
been the need.

152
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,993
We need a lookout in that tower

153
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,945
right now, 24/7.

154
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,913
It's the only way we'll be able
to see if someone's coming at us.

155
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,582
Okay, okay, we'll make shifts.

156
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:03,535
I'll take those shifts,
as many as possible.

157
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,254
Why?

158
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,874
Sasha's one of our best shots.

159
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:10,959
She can do it.

160
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,131
I'm gonna put Spencer
up there today.

161
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,134
I'll consider you being
our primary lookout,

162
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,604
but I want something in return.

163
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:26,357
Tonight I'm hosting a welcome

164
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,778
for all of you at my home.

165
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,563
I want you to be there.

166
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,865
Why?

167
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:37,452
Come tonight.
Then we'll talk about it.

168
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,073
Mashed lima beans,

169
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:43,992
cocoa powder,
a little sweetener.

170
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,961
I would have eaten it
before all this, I swear.

171
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:48,913
It's protein
and it fills you up.

172
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:50,915
Sounds delicious.

173
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,836
I'll be back.
I've got to go beg Rick

174
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:56,221
for some help with tonight.

175
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:57,922
You need anything else,
you hit me, girl.

176
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,175
Okay, thanks.

177
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,430
You've heard about the party?

178
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,098
Everyone's gonna be there.

179
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,434
That's right.

180
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,603
So tonight, then.

181
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,606
Should be able to slip out.

182
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,608
The armory is right
next to Deanna's.

183
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,443
I'll back you up.

184
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,829
People might wonder where
their new constable is

185
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,947
or Carl's dad.

186
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,699
Okay.

187
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,751
We can't use Daryl.

188
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,953
They're watching
every move he makes.

189
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,622
It's fine.

190
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,208
You know what's great
about this place?

191
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,376
I get to be invisible again.

192
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>(horse nickers)</i>

193
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:56,851
(nickers)

194
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,271
I've been trying
to catch him for months,

195
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:01,772
bring him inside.

196
00:13:02,423 --> 00:13:04,442
<i>His name is Buttons.</i>

197
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:09,513
One of the kids saw him run
by the gate a while back.

198
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:11,014
Thought he looked
like a Buttons.

199
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,351
<i>I haven't seen him for a while.</i>

200
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:17,220
I was afraid it was too late.

201
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,144
Every time Eric or I come
close, he gets spooked.

202
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:28,365
Have you done this before?

203
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,233
My group did.

204
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,486
But they weren't
out there that long.

205
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:35,122
The longer they're out there,

206
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,407
the more they become
what they really are.

207
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:51,471
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

208
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:53,507
All right?

209
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,509
Come on, boy.

210
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:57,427
<i>Yeah.</i>

211
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,730
<i>Just keep on eating.</i>

212
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:01,598
Yeah.
(clicks tongue)

213
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,683
Good boy.

214
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,520
Yeah, you used to be
somebody's, huh?

215
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,073
- Now you're just yours.
- <i> (twig snaps)</i>

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,609
Shit!

218
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:17,531
(neighs)

219
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:22,285
- Come on, they're coming!
- <i> (silenced gunshot)</i>

220
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:36,716
Come on.

221
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:41,354
You really substitute
applesauce for eggs?

222
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,356
That could change my life.

223
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,225
If we can keep that
between you and me.

224
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:47,060
It's sort of the secret
to these cookies.

225
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:49,980
- Are you serious?
- I am.

226
00:14:49,982 --> 00:14:51,898
A girl's got
only so many secrets.

227
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,867
It'll die with me.

228
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,369
Uh, the chocolate
is kind of a trick.

229
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,904
You actually have it?

230
00:14:57,906 --> 00:14:59,739
I can only ration you
a quarter bar.

231
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:01,825
I'll make it work.

232
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:04,161
Hey, Olivia.

233
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:06,630
- We're gonna need to make a withdrawal.
- Late start?

234
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,966
Boss lady wants me to check that strut
on the east wall before the party.

235
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,968
Head on back.

236
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,054
Carol, just grab what you need.

237
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:16,590
- Chocolate's in the hall freezer.
- Okay.

238
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,775
You afraid of guns, ma'am?

239
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,111
Mm, no, I...

240
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:40,997
well, I had a handgun
and I carried a rifle

241
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,117
when we were on the outside,
but I'm not an expert.

242
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,587
Not with those, at least.

243
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,708
Well, my name is Tobin.

244
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,127
And whenever you want,

245
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,629
I'd be happy to teach you.

246
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:58,265
Just better to be safe
than sorry.

247
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,801
That'd be nice.
Thanks, Tobin.

248
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:03,937
Thank you, Olivia.

249
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,149
You ride horses?

250
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:18,151
I ride bikes.

251
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:22,489
I take it you don't
mean 10-speeds.

252
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,827
<i>I know you're feeling</i>
<i>like an outsider.</i>

253
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,999
It's not your fault, you know.

254
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,252
Eric and I,

255
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:38,305
we're still looked at as
outsiders in a lot of ways.

256
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:43,677
We've heard our fair
share of well-meaning,

257
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,846
but hilariously offensive things

258
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,099
from some otherwise really
nice men and women.

259
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:53,687
People are people.

260
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:56,356
The more afraid they get,
the more stupid they get.

261
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,327
Fear shrinks the brain.

262
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,999
They're scared of you and
me for different reasons.

263
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,036
They're less scared of me
because they know me.

264
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,924
It's less and less every day.

265
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:19,212
<i>So let them get to know you.</i>

266
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,099
You should go to
Deanna's party tonight.

267
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:26,052
I got nothing to prove.

268
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:29,806
<i>I met a lot</i>
<i>of bad people out here</i>

269
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:32,726
doing a lot of bad shit.

270
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,728
They weren't afraid of nothing.

271
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:38,898
Yeah, they were.

Welcome.

Hi.

276
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:56,216
Oh, it's so good to see you.

277
00:17:56,218 --> 00:17:59,469
Hi, Carl.
Thank you for coming.

278
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:03,139
You know, I didn't get a
chance to interview this one.

279
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:05,225
- <i> I envy her.</i>
- Rick: Why?

280
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,844
She'll get to see what
this place will become.

281
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:10,146
Come.
Come on in.

282
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,534
I don't know about this.

283
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:35,672
They have beer.

284
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:40,126
I'm gonna try.

285
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,021
You're Rick.

286
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,139
Rick, this is my husband Reg.

287
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:55,975
You're a pretty remarkable guy.

288
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,944
How's that?

289
00:18:57,946 --> 00:19:00,980
I watched the tapes.
All of them.

290
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:02,982
The things those people
said about you.

291
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,317
The things you did for them.

292
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:08,321
Didn't you build
that wall out there?

293
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:10,874
(chuckles)
Yeah, I did, with help.

294
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:14,961
A lot of it. And it's a damned
incredible achievement.

295
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:17,914
But it's a wall.

296

I think you have me beat.

299
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:29,142
Well, we're standing behind
that wall right now, dear.

300
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:31,010

You want to come by
my office next week?

356
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:16,030
I'll take a look at you.

357
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,616
And I probably should have
said I was a doctor first.

358
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:20,367
I think it sounded nice
either way.

359
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,003
I'm going to get us a refill.

360
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,872
- Oh, I can do it.
- I'm on it.

361
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:30,010
Having fun?

362
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,931
Yes, I am.

363
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,219
That's kind of a stupid
question, right?

364
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:39,887
(chuckles) No.

365
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,442
Still, this place has
a pretty amazing view.

366
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,228
Yeah?

367
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:50,447
Yeah, take a look.

368
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:59,123
Ordinary life like before.

369
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,409
Well, not like before.

370
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:04,712
No.

371
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:07,665
Yeah, no.

372
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,333
I mean...
I mean, it's better.

373
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,669
Not out there, in here.

374
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:17,341
You know, everyone's been
through it somehow.

375
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:19,760
Everyone.

376
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:22,763
And a lot of things disappeared.

377
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:25,316
But a lot of bullshit
went with it.

378
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,821
They're all from totally
different backgrounds,

379
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,323
different places.

380
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:34,658
They never would have even met.

381
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,078
And now they're part
of each other's lives.

382
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,164
They are each other's lives.

383
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:46,670
I'm just saying,
we all lost things,

384
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,956
but we got something back.

385
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,960
It isn't enough,

386
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:54,511
but it's something.

387
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:58,966
Carl:
<i>No, it was a tie, man.</i>

388
00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:00,801
You saw it, right?

389
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:07,474
(chuckles)

390
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:11,812
Yeah, yeah,
it's a pretty good view.

391
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:18,986
- Mom, there's no more cookies.
- Oh.

392
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:22,122
Well, I happen to know
the cookie maker.

393
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:23,824
She's a good friend of mine.

394
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:26,327
And I might be able
to see about her

395
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:28,212
making a whole batch
just for you.

396
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:30,130
Mom, he doesn't have a stamp.

397
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,882
Oh.

398
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:33,717
Do you want a stamp?

399
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,502
Sure.

400
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,896
See? Now you're
officially one of us.

401
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,015
Yeah.

402
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:51,068
- Ron:<i> Hey, Sam.</i>
- Sam, wait, don't run.

403
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:56,073
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

404
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,383
<i>(knocking)</i>

405
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,673
Trying to make a getaway, huh?

406
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,842
I can pretend I didn't make it.

407
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,930
I'm Sasha.

408
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:27,155
I'm Spencer.
Deanna's my mom.

409
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:30,575
Your mom...

410
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:31,910
she seems nice.

411
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,545
Well, if you want
to hang with me,

412
00:27:33,547 --> 00:27:36,047
I'll make sure you don't get
stuck with Mrs. Neudermyer.

413
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,051
She really, really likes talking about
how much she wants a pasta maker.

414
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:43,755
It's not a conversation
you want to have.

415
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:45,891
Excuse me.

416
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:52,647
(slurping)

417
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,190
(grunts) Thanks.

418
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:06,778
Mmm, when you're out there,

419
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,531
if you happen to be
in a store or something,

420
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,783
Mrs. Neudermyer is really
looking for a pasta maker.

421
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:15,003
And we're all really trying to
get her to shut up about it.

422
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:18,123
I mean, we have crates
of dried pasta in here,

423
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,959
but she wants to make
her own or something.

424
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:23,962
I really think she just wants
something to talk about, so...

425
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:26,798
if you see one
out on your travels,

426
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,967
it would go a long way to...

427
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:37,108
I thought it was done.

428
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,144
You didn't ask him already?

429
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:44,149
Ask me what?

430
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:01,049
When I got the place,
there was that frame

431
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:02,500
<i>and some parts and equipment.</i>

432
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:05,303
Whoever lived here built them.

433
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,307
It's a lot of parts
for one bike.

434
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:13,595
Whenever I came across any parts
out there, I brought them back.

435
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:15,730
I didn't know what I'd need.

436
00:29:15,732 --> 00:29:18,650
I always thought
I'd learn how to do it,

437
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:23,772
but I get the feeling you already
know what to do with it.

438
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:28,576
And the thing is,

439
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:29,945
you're going to need a bike.

440
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:34,866
Why?

441
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:39,921
I told Deanna
not to give you a job

442
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:44,175
<i>because I think</i>
<i>I have one for you.</i>

443
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,547
I'd like you to be
Alexandria's other recruiter.

444
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:52,050
I don't want Eric
risking his life anymore.

445
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:57,055
You want me risking mine, right?

446
00:29:57,057 --> 00:30:00,358
Yeah, because you know
what you're doing.

447
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,560
You're good out there.

448
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:05,397
But you don't belong out there.

449
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,734
<i>I know it's hard getting used
to people getting used to you.</i>

450
00:30:09,736 --> 00:30:13,905
<i>And I understand right now you
need to be out there sometimes.</i>

451
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:15,407
<i>So do I.</i>

452
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:23,915
But the main reason why I
want you to help me recruit

453
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:27,469
is because you do know
the difference

454
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:30,005
between a good person
and a bad person.

455
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:44,602
I got nothing else to do.

456
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,607
Thanks.

457
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:51,109
Yeah.

458
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:54,612
I'll get you some rabbits.

459
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:57,365
(laughs) Great.

460
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,501
<i>(chatter)</i>

461
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:02,253
<i>(door opens)</i>

462
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:08,843
You packing different
steel nowadays?

463
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:11,963
(chuckles)

464
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:13,465
Yeah.

465
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:18,219
Live by it, you die by it...

466
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:21,940
and eat potato puffs by it.

467
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:23,975
(chuckles)

468
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,982
Pray to God you don't
have to use it again.

469
00:31:30,984 --> 00:31:34,319
Pray to God you don't get
used to not using it again.

470
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,991
It's on your back...

471
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:43,495
even when it's off your back.

472
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:47,549
Hmm.

473
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:52,837
How much have you had to drink?

474
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:55,006
(both laugh)

475
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:58,009
I am a large man.

476
00:31:58,011 --> 00:32:01,262
And I have had many beers
to make up for that.

477
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:03,515
Uh-huh.

478
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:05,517
And you know what?

479
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:10,021
By that brave act,
I have...

480
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,525
I have come to realize
that things

481
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:15,910
have worked out
pretty damn well for me.

482
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,330
(chuckles)

483
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:23,368
How about you?

484
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,203
<i>What have you done?</i>

485
00:32:28,842 --> 00:32:30,925
I put on this dress.

486
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:36,381
Try again.

487
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:13,585
Sam:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

488
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:21,142
Sam, what are you doing here?

489
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:23,928
I followed you.

490
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,314
I was hoping you were
going to make more cookies,

491
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:28,516
but then you came here.

492
00:33:28,518 --> 00:33:31,819
Well, I could make more.

493
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:34,606
I could make a whole
batch just for you.

494
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:36,357
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

495
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,111
- I mean, yes, please.
- Okay.

496
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:43,615
But you've got to promise me you can
keep it secret that I came here.

497
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:46,784
But I'd have to tell my mom.

498
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:49,003
I mean, I tell
my mom everything.

499
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:51,339
You can never tell anyone,

500
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,458
especially your mom.

501
00:33:55,512 --> 00:33:57,629
Because if you do...

502
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:01,382
one morning you'll wake up...

503
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:07,388
and you won't be in your bed.

504
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,691
Where will I be?

505
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:13,228
You'll be outside the walls

506
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,447
far, far away

507
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,316
tied to a tree.

508
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:21,986
And you'll scream and scream

509
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:24,572
because you'll be so afraid.

510
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:28,209
No one will come to help

511
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:31,913
because no one will hear you.

512
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, something will hear you.

513
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:38,253
The monsters will come.

514
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:41,005
The ones out there.

515
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:44,175
And you won't be able to run
away when they come for you.

516
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:49,264
And they will tear you
apart and eat you up

517
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:52,066
all while you're still alive.

518
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:55,520
All while you can still feel it.

519
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:00,692
And then afterwards,

520
00:35:00,694 --> 00:35:03,695
no one will ever know
what happened to you.

521
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,121
Or you can promise

522
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:16,591
not to ever tell anyone
what you saw here

523
00:35:16,593 --> 00:35:19,427
and then nothing will happen.

524
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,381
And you'll get cookies.

525
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:25,350
Lots of cookies.

526
00:35:30,307 --> 00:35:33,308
I know what I think
you should do.

527
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:37,645
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- <i> (chatter)</i>

528
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:44,068
That's a pretty good
view, too, isn't it?

529
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:50,742
It's been a long time
since I held one of these.

530
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:00,585
She and Carl...

531
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,305
they're why I'm still here.

532
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:09,977
And I get what
you've been telling me.

533
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:13,648
What's that?

534
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,935
Here isn't that bad.

535
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:24,158
(fusses)

536
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,693
Do you want to take her?

537
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,278
Yeah.

538
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:10,621
Sasha.
Come join us.

539
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:12,457
I promise all you
have to do is listen.

540
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,492
Come on.

541
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:16,210
Okay.

542
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:25,002
Bless her heart. I don't get
what takes her so long.

543
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:27,004
I mean, we only have one copy

544
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:29,090
<i>and the point of book club</i>
<i>is that we all read the book.</i>

545
00:37:29,092 --> 00:37:31,509
I just keep hoping that a
dentist shows up at our gates.

546
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:34,979
- It's his teeth. - I mean, it's just
so much better when it's fresh.

547
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:37,899
- <i> (overlapping conversations)</i>

550
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,286
Sasha, honey,
what's your favorite meal?

551
00:37:58,288 --> 00:37:59,921
I'd love to cook it
for you sometime.

552
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:01,923
I'm doing it for all
the new arrivals.

553
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,208
- I don't know.
- Of course you do.

554
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,128
Everyone has favorites.
So what's yours?

555
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:10,181
Whatever you want.

556
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:13,601
I'm just worried that I'll end up
cooking something you hate, you know?

557
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:16,387
You're worried?

558
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,689
That's what you worry about?!

559
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:38,337
I'm trying to figure
out what it is.

560
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,672
What it is exactly.

561
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:47,479
This...

562
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:53,685
it isn't real.

563
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:55,854
Sasha, you've been through a lot

564
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:58,407
and I accept that,
but what you just said...

565
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:02,027
that's bullshit.

566
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:23,382
Take your pick.

567
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:25,717
Look, I've been thinking.

568
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,519
Do we really need these?

569
00:39:29,223 --> 00:39:31,273
I mean, things go bad,
yeah, sure.

570
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:34,226
We do what we gotta do,
but it's like you said.

571
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:35,777
We don't need these for that.

572
00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:37,613
Right now we don't.

573
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,402
You wanted me to try, right?

574
00:39:43,404 --> 00:39:45,370
I'm good.
