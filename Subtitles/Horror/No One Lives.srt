1
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,097
(woman screams )

2
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,603
- ( footsteps rustling )
- ( woman screams )

3
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,534
(woman grunting, panting )

4
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,883
( screams )

5
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,978
( grunting, panting )

6
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,072
Help me!

7
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,953
Wait! Help!

8
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,124
No!

9
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,876
Argh!

10
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,411
No!

11
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,546
( Screaming )

12
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,050
( grunting, sobbing )

13
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:28,062
( screaming )

14
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,838
( music playing on radio )

15
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,893
I don't know.
It's just not gonna be the same.

16
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,646
Trust me, it will be the same.

17
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,857
I'm going to miss everyone.

18
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,065
You saw everybody.

19
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,986
Sometimes it's necessary
to relocate.

20
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,655
Don't make it seem
like it's not your fault.

21
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,074
Out of every bad situation

22
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,584
comes something good.
Don't you agree?

23
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,337
You have a truly demented way
of looking at things.

24
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,418
If I didn't,

25
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,708
I don't think you'd be
so in love with me.

26
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,254
( Chuckles )

27
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,298
Don't flatter yourself.

28
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,847
I'm tired.

29
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,978
Let's stop somewhere
for the night.

30
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,320
( Pings )

31
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,078
Hey now.

32
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,118
Please don't tell me
you're here for directions.

33
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,287
I got 15 rooms,
all with your name on 'em.

34
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,332
Well, good news is,
I know exactly where I'm going.

35
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,216
The bad news is,
I only need one room.

36
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,127
Well, I'll take what I can get.

37
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,296
I just need a credit card.

38
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,845
Wow.

39
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,353
Pretty, young-

40
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,355
- Just the way I like 'em.
- Yeah.

41
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,267
Well, that's an unusual name.

42
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,027
Yeah.

43
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,030
My father had a unforgiving commitment
to historical reference.

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,318
Oh. Well, let's just
get you fixed up, huh?

45
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:51,160
How does number 8
sound to you?

46
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,826
Infinity-- I like it.

47
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,960
TV anchorman:
...Jet fighters bombed a guerilla base,

48
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,747
killing at least 49 soldiers
and 13 civilians.

49
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,043
- Man: There it is again.
- Anchor: Up next, local law enforcement

50
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,303
and the FBI are scouring
the area north of Spokane

51
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,682
for any evidence that can lead them
to missing heiress Emma Ward.

52
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,014
Officer: From what we can tell,
the carving's about six months old.

53
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,771
It reads "Emma alive."

54
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,353
It's impossible to get
an accurate date,

55
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,395
but tree growth on that particular alder
indicate about a half a year,

56
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,529
probably done in the spring,
right around--

57
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,192
well, after her abduction.

58
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,281
- Clever girl.
- Anchor: Joining us now in the studio

59
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,241
- is the former FBI investigator...
- You think?

60
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,031
Anchor: ...who has worked
many similar cases.

61
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,041
I don't think I would have
thought to do that.

62
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,827
Anchor: What are the FBI agents
dealing with...

63
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,290
Now she has a chance.

64
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,705
- There's always a chance.
- FBI agent: ...as much information...

65
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,874
(TV off)

66
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,424
But you know how these things
turn out.

67
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,226
Take off the towel.

68
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,238
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,413
I'm sorry for everything.

70
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,501
A man who lacks emotion
is sorry.

71
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,665
I don't lack emotion.

72
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,545
I just process it differently.

73
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,685
Must everything about you
be different?

74
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,972
I like normal.

75
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,982
I would change if I could,
but I can't.

76
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,143
I just can't.

77
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,699
Just tell me you don't love her
more than me.

78
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,959
I don't love her more than you.

79
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,121
I never did.

80
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,586
It was just different.

81
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,414
( Birds chirping )

82
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,330
( rock music playing )

83
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,216
- Burly man: Put some muscle in it.
- ( grunts )

84
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,047
Youth:
That's easy for you to say.

85
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,757
( Burly man chuckles )

86
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,353
You gotta be kidding.

87
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,644
Jack, can you do me a favor
and go open the gate?

88
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,187
Why?

89
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,026
Why? Because the gate
won't open.

90
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,157
( Chuckles )
I need you to open it, please.

91
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,070
- ( Jack sighs )
- Thank you.

92
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,615
( Music continues )

93
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,160
Trouble! Trouble!

94
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,705
Ho!

95
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,375
( Sighs )
Home sweet home.

96
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,516
- Man: Who are these guys?
- Woman: Honey.

97
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,478
Mind my lead.
Let me do the talking.

98
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,485
Talking? Don't you think
it's a little late for talking?

99
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,322
Hand me-- give me the phone.

100
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,491
- ( Woman screaming )
- Youth: What's he doing?

101
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,875
- Youth: What is he doing?
- Woman: Flynn, stop it!

102
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,037
Woman:
Flynn, what the fuck?

103
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,544
What the fuck, man?

104
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,504
Argh! Motherfucker.

105
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,878
Woman:
Enough!

106
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,514
- Flynn: Damn it!
- Ethan: Come on, man. Get up.

107
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,299
Your problem, Flynn,
is you don't fucking think.

108
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,514
- He had a phone.
- You have a phone.

109
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,473
Should I shoot you?

110
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,730
Every cop in the county
heard that racket.

111
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,065
You made a mess here, Flynn.

112
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,229
Excuse me for saving
our fucking asses.

113
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,444
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen?

114
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,656
That we'd just sit down and have
a cup of tea with the Cleavers?

115
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,536
Woman: You told us
they were on vacation, Flynn.

116
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,572
Flynn: Well, now
they're on permanent vacation.

117
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,084
- Woman: Fuck this.
- This is so seriously fucked up.

118
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,119
- Woman: Shit.
- Is he fucking crying?

119
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,959
- Are you fucking crying?
- Youth: What did you do?

120
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,874
Ethan, let's shut it down.

121
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,508
Shut it down? Shut it down?

122
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,385
- What about all the--?
- He said shut it down.

123
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,047
Like we were never here.
Come on, let's go.

124
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,232
I had to.

125
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,669
I'm hungry-

126
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,174
So go eat.

127
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,336
And leave you here alone?
Right.

128
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,006
Why don't you go have dinner
with your girlfriend?

129
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,096
Would you be rational?

130
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,400
I know what you were doing
out there.

131
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,771
You're wrong.

132
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,860
(drill whirring)

133
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,497
Hey, where do you suggest
we eat tonight?

134
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,130
Let's see, uh...

135
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,668
go up here about 20 miles
and take a right on Highway 21.

136
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,303
There's a place called Helen's--

137
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,634
great food, delicious steaks.

138
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,889
Great. Thanks.

139
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,970
This old boy treating you well?

140
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,097
All right, then.

141
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,892
You kids enjoy yourself
and I'll see you when you get back.

142
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,407
Man:
This is all about her, isn't it?

143
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,448
Woman: Can you possibly imagine
it being about anybody else?

144
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,209
Man: Can we just enjoy
a pleasant dinner?

145
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,957
( Door lock chirps )

146
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,001
Woman: Doesn't look like we'll have
trouble finding a table.

147
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,511
Man: Note to self--
"Do not order the fish."

148
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,342
(woman chuckles )

149
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,634
Man:
Aha. A sign of forgiveness?

150
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,393
Woman:
Don't get carried away.

151
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,725
( Man chuckles )

152
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,856
( cowbell rattles )

153
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,017
( music playing softly )

154
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,354
( cowbell rattles )

155
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,363
Get yourself comfortable.

156
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,865
Sit anywhere you like.

157
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,368
It's awful quiet these months.

158
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,779
Amber will be right with you.

159
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,040
Amber, table!

160
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,501
Hey there.

161
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,538
I'm Amber.

162
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,002
Today's fish is a terrific
John Dory

163
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,008
and the steak is an aged rib eye.

164
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,670
Is it aged
because no one orders it?

165
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,884
Very funny.

166
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,800
Why don't I start you off
with something to drink?

167
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,514
Wine.

168
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,804
( Cowbell rattles )

169
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,064
- Oh, shit.
- Helen, a pitcher.

170
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,105
( Rock music playing faintly )

171
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,524
Flynn: Where's your
sense of humor, Hoag?

172
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,114
I just have to have my--

173
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,655
my fun.

174
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,665
He's a total psychopath.

175
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,122
I'm a team player.

176
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,713
You, my friend,
have become a fucking liability.

177
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,625
And my fucking wallet is empty.

178
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,595
Ethan's right.
Today's on you.

179
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,506
Figure out a way to make it right

180
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,176
and maybe we will be
friends again.

181
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,843
Denny:
True that.

182
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,472
Are you--
are you mad at me also?

183
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,440
Listen, if I have to take
any shit from you today,

184
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,527
I'm gonna turn your fucking ball sack
into a beanie.

185
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,112
- I'm just saying--
- Shut the fuck up.

186
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,323
You can talk
once you've put in your time.

187
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,631
I have to take a leak.

188
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,138
Don't tell me
you're watching your weight.

189
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,976
A girl's gotta keep her figure.

190
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,936
You're crazy.

191
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,896
Look who's talking.

192
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,073
Hey, are you guys
from around here?

193
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,364
I think they're mutes.

194
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,543
- I think they're fucking mutes.
- Denny: God damn it.

195
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,248
We're just passing through.

196
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,633
I see.

197
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,045
- Are you moving?
- Relocating.

198
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,466
Traveling with all your
worldly belongings?

199
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,010
This is my only
worldly belonging.

200
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,722
Is that right?

201
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,107
How much
is she worth to you?

202
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,893
Please, we don't want
any trouble.

203
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,358
- Look, just forget it, okay?
- Hey!

204
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,233
If I wanted to hear
from an asshole,

205
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,402
I'd rip you a new one.

206
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,364
All right?

207
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,456
The way I see it,

208
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,748
your girlfriend looks at me
like I'm the unsavory type.

209
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,385
Like I'm someone
you don't even want to get to know.

210
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,513
Uncouth, perhaps.
Is that it?

211
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,518
Don't.

212
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,192
Yeah, don't.

213
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,194
You're not the type.

214
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,447
Trust me, I know the type.

215
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,159
Don't mind my boy here.

216
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,542
His idea of friendliness
is to scare the tourists.

217
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,998
( Softly )
Boo.

218
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,914
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

219
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,128
Please excuse us.

220
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,043
- Hoag: Move.
- Whoa.

221
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,428
( Flynn chuckles, whistles )

222
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:18,513
Do not shit where I eat.

223
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,353
( Door closes, bell rattles )

224
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,777
( music continues )
J' 'Cause death is my best friend. J'

225
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,444
( insects chirping )

226
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,500
( music playing on radio )

227
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,089
Am I really your only
worldly possession?

228
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,879
Of all people,

229
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,015
- you should know I need my--
- ( motorcycle engine revving )

230
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,971
( tires screech )

231
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,850
( bangs )

232
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,667
( car approaching )

233
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,445
" ( Flynn groans)
<i>'</i> ( Hoag chuckling )

234
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,197
What in fuck's name is this?

235
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,575
We can strip her down.
There's parts in here.

236
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,039
And where, pray tell,
is the owner of this luxury vehicle?

237
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,080
Convalescing at the gas station,

238
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,875
after which Ethan

239
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,293
will encourage him
to cooperate.

240
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,135
I told you, I don't like you getting
my brother involved in your shit.

241
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,266
This guy is some uppity
rich motherfucker

242
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,552
who was at the right place
at the right time.

243
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,142
All it's gonna take
is just a little bit of torture

244
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,728
and we'll have bank codes,
pin numbers and all sorts of shit.

245
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,144
Kidnapping tourists
is your idea of fast cash?

246
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,781
Did I not just make up
for the short haul?

247
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,112
Why don't you get off
my fucking ass?

248
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,745
Flynn, another fuckup like today,
and I end you.

249
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,120
Clear?

250
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,261
( Clanking, creaking )

251
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,640
( door slams )

252
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,150
Where are we?

253
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,114
Last place on earth.

254
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,778
Oh...

255
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,321
a comedian.

256
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,491
This seem funny to you?

257
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,473
Have they hurt you?

258
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,260
What do you think?

259
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,985
I've made a decision.

260
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,943
(sobs)
Please forgive me.

261
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,987
Shh.

262
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,825
No talking, sweetness.

263
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,806
I can't do this anymore.

264
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,975
Ethan:
I said shut up.

265
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,985
(whispers )
Betty, don't.

266
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,567
It's been an experience.

267
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,372
- ( Woman screams )
- What the fuck?

268
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,579
<i>Oh, "W"</i>

269
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,667
I'll see you in the next life.

270
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,877
Don't.

271
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,209
No!

272
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,377
Ethan:
What the fuck?

273
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,546
( Screaming )

274
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,014
Ethan:
What the fuck?

275
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,853
Get away from her.

276
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,152
Hey. HEY-

277
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,588
You're dead, fucker.

278
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,839
Shit.

279
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,723
(grunting )

280
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,690
-(coughs)
- That's where you're mistaken.

281
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,943
But this should clear up
the confusion.

282
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,480
( Gasps )

283
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,909
Handcuffs- that was
your first mistake.

284
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,748
You people never heard
of zip ties?

285
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,501
( Ethan whimpering )

286
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,889
- ( Emma grunting)
- Come on.

287
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,851
Can I get some fucking help
here, please?

288
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,062
It's too late for this
fucking shit, Flynn.

289
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,193
Fuck, what the fuck is that?

290
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,149
This is a girl that I found
in the fucking trunk.

291
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,485
Fuck, she smells like
a fucking toilet.

292
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,445
-( Emma grunting)
- All right, all right, all right.

293
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,155
Hold still, all right?

294
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,195
I'm gonna take this off.

295
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,580
You're gonna stand still.
Easy, easy.

296
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,115
Okay?

297
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,251
- ( Screams )
- Come here. Did she bite me?

298
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,253
- Tamara: Fuck.
- ( screaming )

299
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,209
Flynn:
Hey.

300
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,748
Hey. HEY-

301
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,509
- Flynn: Stop it. Stop it.
- ( Emma screaming )

302
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,930
Denny: What the hell
is all that yelling?

303
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,091
There's a world of shit
erupting downstairs.

304
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,135
Flynn:
Stop it.

305
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,803
It's 2:30 in the morning.

306
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,099
And there's some girl down there
screaming like she's got bugs up in her.

307
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,062
Don't bust my balls, Amber.

308
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,773
Seems like Flynn carjacked
that couple from the restaurant.

309
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,938
- Cut the shit.
- No, seriously.

310
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,448
- I gotta check it out.
- No, you ain't gotta do nothing.

311
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,280
- No, I gotta go. I gotta go.
- No.

312
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,115
I gotta go.

313
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,871
( Emma screaming )

314
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,036
- No. No. No.
- What the fuck is going on?

315
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,332
Flynn found her
in the trunk of the car.

316
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,841
Where is he? Where is he?

317
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,878
You killed him, right?
Please tell me he's dead.

318
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,093
Expand on "he."

319
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,552
Oh, God.

320
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,717
- What's going on?
- We have to get out of here.

321
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,602
- We-- we have to--
- What?

322
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,730
Get Ethan on the radio, now.
Now. Go.

323
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,018
No, we have to leave now.
We have to get out of here now.

324
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,902
Why won't you let me go?

325
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,813
What were you doing
in the trunk of that car?

326
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,651
Answer him.

327
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,986
- Answer him.
- ( grunts)

328
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,902
He had to move. He knew
they were coming, so he had to--

329
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,662
Tamara: Who the fuck
are we talking about?

330
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,072
Listen to me. He's gonna come for me.
He always does.

331
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,832
Why don't you start
by telling us his name?

332
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,743
He doesn't have a name.

333
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,787
He's gonna come
and he's gonna kill you all.

334
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,172
Dad, Ethan is not coming up
on the radio.

335
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,582
Keep trying-

336
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,842
You're not gonna get him.
You're not gonna get him.

337
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,719
He's-- he's already dead.

338
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,254
How the fuck do you know?

339
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,639
Shut the fuck up, Flynn!

340
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,175
( Emma panting )

341
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,685
Please just call the police.

342
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,222
Are you people fucking retarded?

343
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:50,103
Go up the road
and wake Ethan the fuck up.

344
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,146
I'm going with him.

345
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,565
This Flynn show
is getting under my skin.

346
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,665
I'm sick of being disrespected.

347
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,955
Denny, it's not a fucking
book club.

348
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,716
You earn your way around here.
If you want respect,

349
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,967
- you need to grow a pair.
- Yeah, like Flynn?

350
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,379
Flynn might be a scumbag,

351
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:19,515
but he's a loyal soldier,
and that means something.

352
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,551
Well, I'm practically blood.

353
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,721
Banging his little girl
doesn't buy you rights.

354
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,013
Makes you brave, though,

355
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,228
considering every dick in town
has been in that shit.

356
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,733
This is my girlfriend
you're talking about.

357
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,234
God, Dens, please.

358
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,250
Something's not right.

359
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,839
Tamara:
All right, let's go.

360
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,302
( Dripping echoes )

361
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,343
Denny:
Ethan, are you in here?

362
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,644
- ( Radio buzzing )
- What the fuck happened to the radio?

363
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,902
Whoa!

364
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,235
Oh, fuck.

365
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,326
What the fuck? What the fuck?

366
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,828
( Screams )
Oh!

367
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,534
Oh.

368
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,038
How the fuck did he kill Ethan?

369
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,800
- Mother of God.
- Nobody kills Ethan.

370
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,757
Tamara: What the hell
happened here?

371
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,797
Denny:
Oh, fuck.

372
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,689
This is so wrong.

373
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,117
Flynn really fucked up bad,
didn't he?

374
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,622
Looks that way.

375
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,259
- ( Denny retches )
- Fuck.

376
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,742
Here, I think these should fit you.

377
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,916
Hey!

378
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,759
- What's gotten into you, girl?
- Maybe we should let her clean up.

379
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,352
Till we hear from Ethan, I'm not
letting that one out of my sight.

380
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,772
I already told you,

381
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,273
he's dead.

382
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,685
You don't know my brother.

383
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,114
I never will.

384
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,739
( Both grunting )

385
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,780
Tamara:
Push.

386
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,164
( Tamara coughs, panting )

387
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,886
What happened to you?

388
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,971
What's your name?

389
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,819
( Door closes )

390
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,114
I have a question.

391
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,784
Do you people have any idea
what you're dealing with?

392
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,579
Where the fuck is the girl? I told you
not to let her out of your sight.

393
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,835
You know how you guys
always make fun of me

394
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,341
for watching all those
reality shows?

395
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,095
Well, just wait till you see this.

396
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,132
( Theme music playing )

397
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,391
So it's mostly just pedophiles
and bank robbers,

398
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,972
guys who kill their families
and shit,

399
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,309
but I've been totally into
this one story.

400
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,850
Baby girl,
don't be wasting my time.

401
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,359
Amber:
This one.

402
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,396
That's you, right?

403
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,440
It was like any other Friday night
at the Oregon Arts Complex--

404
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,484
a night that would be
seared into the minds

405
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:51,074
of parents
of 15 college students forever.

406
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,366
Oregon student Emma Ward
and her friends were having a party,

407
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,035
celebrating the end of the semester
like most students.

408
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,670
Except this celebration
turned bloody.

409
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,502
A killer entered the house.
Was he already there, waiting,

410
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,508
or was he a friend?

411
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,340
Police and federal authorities
have never been able to place together

412
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,425
the mystery of how or why
it happened.

413
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,967
But when it was over,
14 students had been brutally murdered.

414
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,853
Only one was never found--
Emma Ward,

415
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,856
the heiress to the Nashville-based
Ward Publication empire.

416
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,142
Did she know the killer?
Until now, it was unclear.

417
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,027
That's when hunter Richard Louie
discovered this.

418
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,654
I was tracking a deer
when it got caught up in this thing.

419
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,861
Officer: Apparently the carving
is about eight months old.

420
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,868
Lab tests prove that this is
Emma Ward's blood on the glass.

421
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,575
Now we must continue our investigation
under the premise

422
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,239
that she is out there somewhere.

423
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,159
Narrator: The Ward family is offering
a $2 million reward

424
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,250
for any information leading
to the recovery of their daughter.

425
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,211
Up next, Kansas City authorities
are still searching

426
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,217
for a 20-month-old toddler
after her sudden disappearance

427
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,049
from her home three weeks ago.
"American Crime"...

428
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,931
- ( TV off )
- Jackpot.

429
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,012
And the driver of the car...?

430
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,053
Is the maniac who did all that.

431
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,768
That bitch has "payday"
written all across her face.

432
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,808
Yeah, and a trail of heat
from here to Oregon

433
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,445
hunting for the motherfucker
who kidnapped her.

434
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,856
Hoag, we're not talking about

435
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,073
some nickel-and-dime
highway robbery bullshit.

436
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,237
- ( Men speaking softly )
- Emma,

437
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,747
you know we're only here
to help you, right?

438
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,750
Hoag:
...But this presents...

439
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,287
- ( spits )
- ...complications.

440
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,250
( Hisses )

441
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,382
Tamara:
Hoag?

442
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,543
- A word.
- Amber: Denny.

443
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,712
Stay here.

444
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,818
I want this motherfucker found.

445
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,276
Denny: We searched for the guy.
I think he hoofed it into the woods.

446
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,112
Well, you didn't look
hard enough.

447
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,654
Flynn: At least we know
he's not gonna go to the cops.

448
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,292
Hoag:
The man who did this

449
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,327
doesn't forget

450
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,837
the man who crossed him,

451
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,998
and neither do I.

452
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,087
Get Ethan out of here.
Put him in the shed.

453
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,632
We are gonna
clean this mess up.

454
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,143
( M utters )

455
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,560
Denny: Why are we the ones moving him
all over this fucking country?

456
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,695
We should bury him proper.

457
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,483
Flynn:
I ain't digging that hole.

458
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,651
( Denny grunts )

459
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,660
Jesus.

460
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,248
That should keep
the flies off him.

461
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,414
Now go clean up
the back of the van.

462
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,129
That's bullshit.
I picked him up.

463
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,028
I told you.
You should have listened to me.

464
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,940
I need to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

465
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,233
Where's the girl-- Betty?

466
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,742
Dead.

467
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,745
I guess he was done with her.

468
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,201
What?

469
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,584
No, he would never do that,
not to her. You--

470
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,290
you guys fucked up.
You really fucked up.

471
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,958
Am I right in guessing
your friend will be heading our way?

472
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,510
I am asking you a question.

473
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,013
- ( Bones crack)
- ( grunting )

474
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,847
Stop her!

475
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,519
Stop. Stop"

476
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,984
or it will be your brains
running down those stairs.

477
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,275
Then you'd better
get yourself a mop.

478
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,488
(cocks gun )

479
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,913
Oh, that's fine.

480
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,049
My best hope of escape is while
he's killing the whole bunch of you.

481
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,212
So I'll just wait.

482
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,969
(whirrs)

483
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,760
( beeps )

484
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,225
( blade rings )

485
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,564
You're telling me
that chick is worth $2 million?

486
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,948
Yep.

487
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,951
Denny, stop fucking counting the cash.
Start loading the guns.

488
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,494
Watch this bitch.
If she moves, waste her.

489
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,535
Tamara, after we take off,
lock this place down.

490
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,328
Shoot anything
that comes through the door.

491
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,372
Wait, wait, wait,
what do you mean, we?

492
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,257
This prick is not gonna
find himself now, is he?

493
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,169
Well, shouldn't one of us hang back
and protect the girls?

494
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,964
Nobody's hanging back.
We're hunting this motherfucker

495
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,599
and we are gonna burn him down.

496
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,259
Denny:
What, as-- as on fire?

497
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,144
Flynn: It's a figure of speech,
you idiot.

498
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,395
Hoag:
Come on!

499
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,523
I want this motherfucker dead.

500
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,059
Argh!

501
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,275
(groaning )

502
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,940
Hoag!

503
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,200
( Screaming )

504
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,452
Motherfucker.

505
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,704
Tamara:
Fuck. Shit.

506
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,831
( Gunfire popping )

507
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,797
- Tamara: You see him?
- Where the fuck are you?

508
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,299
Come out and fight
like a man, bitch.

509
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,144
Tamara:
Get back in!

510
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,891
Fuck. I'm fucking shot.

511
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,434
- Denny.
- Am I fucking dying?

512
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,899
- Denny.
- Am I dying?

513
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,314
- Fuck me. I can't believe it.
- Where's Hoag?

514
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,904
- Gone.
- Gone? What does he mean, gone?

515
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,945
- He's gone. He's gone. He got him.
- ( Amber sobbing )

516
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,329
( Denny sobbing )

517
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,365
Fucking Flynn, give me
some fucking help here.

518
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,501
- Denny: Am I fucking dying?
- Tamara: Get up, get up.

519
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,332
( All chattering )

520
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,339
Tamara: We're losing a ton
of blood here. Get him to the couch.

521
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,460
Where's my dad?

522
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,720
- Denny: I don't know. I don't know.
- Flynn: Let me look at it.

523
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,804
- Denny: There's a lot of blood.
- Let me look at it!

524
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,265
It's just a flesh wound, all right, man?
You're gonna be all right.

525
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,305
You're not going
back out there.

526
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:00,021
I'm not leaving without Hoag.

527
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,560
Hoag is history.

528
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,820
Fuck you, Flynn.
He wouldn't leave without you.

529
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,822
In case you haven't noticed,
he's everywhere.

530
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,735
So if you want to take your sweet tits
and get shot off, be my guest!

531
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,377
(coughing )

532
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,549
Motherfucker.

533
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,435
What's he doing?

534
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,596
He's trapping us.

535
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,687
If you hadn't killed
all those fucking people...

536
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,186
Killed what people?

537
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,690
- Killed what people?
- None that concern you!

538
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:55,539
Flynn, you might want to drop
the bad guy routine.

539
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,541
I'm your path to living,
and you seem to be bent

540
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,043
on playing the dying game.

541
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,051
Well then, we're gonna
die together, bitch.

542
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,594
(machine whirring )

543
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,758
( metal clanging )

544
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,563
(groaning )

545
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,523
So, what are you,
the leader here?

546
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,938
You are playing this all wrong.

547
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,905
My people are gonna find you
and they're gonna fucking kill you.

548
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,410
Man: Who knows?
You might all be heroes.

549
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,414
Well, not you.

550
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,994
(grunting )

551
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,253
( screams )

552
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,421
You motherfucking cocksucker.

553
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,509
Fuck.

554
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,051
You must be satisfied
to go from leader to martyr.

555
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,094
Any thoughts?

556
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,148
( Screams )

557
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,353
Hello?

558
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,518
(whimpering )

559
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,780
I can get the girl for you.

560
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,739
I can get the girl for you.
You can go on your way.

561
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,779
No. No.

562
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,620
You see, I'm planning on handling
that little task on my own.

563
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,536
I thought you were gonna help me
get things back to the way they were.

564
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,046
Can you do that--
turn back time?

565
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,708
- Hoag: No.
- Man: No.

566
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,344
You know what I hate
about the common criminal?

567
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,925
They're so mediocre.

568
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,136
Please, what the fuck
are you talking about?

569
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,348
Man: It's in mendacity
that we achieve our very best.

570
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,683
Is this your best?

571
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,972
Fuck you.

572
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,312
Man: Because I am not
even close.

573
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,818
- Let me up. Let me up.
- You know who I am?

574
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,774
Man:
Who am I?

575
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,815
Who...

576
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,824
am I?

577
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,860
Hoag: I don't know.
A serial killer?

578
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,489
Man:
A serial killer?

579
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,829
Sweet Jesus, no.

580
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,040
Serial killers deal in singularities.
I'm a numbers guy,

581
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,831
which makes me
a total psychopath.

582
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,592
Admittedly, there are a few things
that might stereotype me--

583
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,049
fixations, rituals,

584
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,134
trophies.

585
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,515
Case in point.

586
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,518
But what really motivates me

587
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,850
is the absolute need
to get the job done.

588
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,230
How many are in the house?
Do your math, quick.

589
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,189
Five. There's five.

590
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,979
Including my Emma?

591
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,023
Oh, you're under the impression
she's one of you, huh?

592
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,691
( Chuckles )

593
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,327
Okay, you've served your purpose.

594
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,701
Any last words?

595
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,791
Pity.

596
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,831
Concise,

597
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,671
not terribly clever,
but the clarity of the intention--

598
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,756
crystal clear.

599
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,796
However, no.

600
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,306
- No, please.
- ( thumping )

601
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,638
( Hoag grunting, screaming )

602
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,664
I bet you want to kill the man
who did this to you.

603
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:36,255
Your powers of perception
are staggering.

604
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,969
Why you?

605
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,430
I guess you could say

606
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,474
he loves me.

607
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,645
Today we're gonna advance
to something much more challenging.

608
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,029
Let's meditate for a moment

609
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,441
on the power you have

610
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,781
over living things.

611
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,116
The only thing
keeping you in here

612
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,371
is me.

613
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,624
Anything happens to me,

614
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,127
and you die.

615
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,122
Fun fact--

616
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,132
there are documented cases

617
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,339
in which prisoners
found in cages

618
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,050
long after their captors
surrendered,

619
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,467
left to their own, final,

620
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,432
desperate measures,

621
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,142
actually cannibalized
themselves.

622
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,477
You know what the technical term
for that is?

623
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,487
Please stop.

624
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,193
Sarcophagy-

625
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,233
Emma,

626
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,119
listen to me carefully.

627
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,408
When the arterial vein is sliced,

628
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,294
the body tends to bleed out
within 10 minutes.

629
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,671
It's not like in the movies

630
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,708
when someone's jugular
is severed

631
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,217
and they immediately
drop dead.

632
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,924
No.

633
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,964
But it's also impossible
for the victim

634
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,850
to administer the proper medical help.
Do you know what that is?

635
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,181
No.

636
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,346
No biggie.

637
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,357
I'm not a doctor either.

638
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,768
I can tell you
this much, though--

639
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,062
you elevate the wound
above the heart

640
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,447
and you apply pressure
to the area.

641
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,075
And you bandage tightly.
That's very important.

642
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,236
( Gasps, <i>sobs</i> )

643
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,991
Why are you telling me this?

644
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:37,081
Because no matter
how much you hate me,

645
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:41,252
you now have the opportunity
to save my life.

646
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,966
( Screams )

647
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,488
What's gonna happen
to my dad?

648
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,999
You and your dad--
you didn't get along.

649
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,957
He wasn't the best role model.

650
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,174
He's going to be tortured
and killed.

651
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,087
Hmm.

652
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,841
Why didn't he kill you?

653
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,603
I think he was trying
to create me.

654
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,389
What did he do to you?

655
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,523
Would he hurt you?

656
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,778
You should have run
while you had the chance.

657
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,337
All right, Dens,
here, swallow this.

658
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,373
I don't want to die.

659
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,338
Just swallow this.
It will take the edge off, all right?

660
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,844
All right.
Good boy, good boy. All right.

661
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,006
No one's dying on my watch,
all right?

662
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,390
( Denny sobs )

663
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,517
(coughs)

664
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,520
- Oh.
- Tamara: All right, fine.

665
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,772
We need to get him
some real help here.

666
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,432
Good idea.

667
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,692
I'll call an ambulance.
Let me get right on that.

668
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,445
What about the Jeep?
Unless he got into the garage.

669
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,572
It's been broken down
for a fucking year.

670
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,279
Dad is dead.
Ethan is dead.

671
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,195
Denny's not doing so hot.

672
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,614
<i>I'm looking at your ugly asses
and guess what I'm thinking.</i>

673
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,203
I'm thinking fucking dead!

674
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,038
You know what?

675
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,998
No one's ever given a shit
what you think.

676
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,083
Listen, bitch,
just because my old man

677
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,374
was giving you the deep dicking
doesn't make you my mother.

678
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,089
And with him dead, that pretty much
makes this my fucking house.

679
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,970
So why don't you shut the fuck up
or get the fuck out?

680
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,130
Fuck!

681
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,390
- Denny: Oh, God.
- Hello.

682
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,362
- Aggh!
- Come on, bitch.

683
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,025
Hey, enough.

684
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,739
- Enough.
- ( thumps)

685
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,746
Someone's at the door.

686
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,907
(thumps)

687
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,288
( thumping continues )

688
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,344
Want to go take a peek?

689
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,637
You go take a peek.

690
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,806
( Thumping stops )

691
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,563
You gigantic pussies.

692
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,449
I'll look.

693
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,432
Tamara:
Is it Hoag?

694
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,977
- No, it's a bag.
- Flynn: What kind of bag?

695
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,521
I don't know. Just a bag.

696
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,692
Move.

697
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,552
No!
Do not open that door.

698
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,383
Whatever's in the bag is bad.

699
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,758
Just get the fuck out of my way.

700
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,940
That's my dad's ring.

701
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,659
Is that blood? Fucking hell.

702
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,415
Just close the fucking door!

703
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:26,328
Enough, motherfucker!
Come on, bring it!

704
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,339
(women screaming )

705
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,511
Oh, fuck.

706
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,940
Denny, I have to get out of here
right now.

707
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,645
I can get the Jeep going.

708
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,153
What, are you fucking crazy?

709
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:57,113
If I don't make a move
right now,

710
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,994
I'm not gonna last long.

711
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,952
You know it. I know it.

712
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,708
I can get that Jeep going.

713
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,290
And I'll get us
the fuck out of here.

714
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,309
Gun.

715
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,320
Okay, Den.

716
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,705
You realize he's probably got
the whole place rigged, right?

717
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,411
You ready?

718
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,997
( Faintly )
I love you.

719
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,165

Fuck.

723

Emma: You shouldn't have
let them go.

724
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,945
What's it to you?

725
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,326
Well, 'cause when they're dead,

726
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,703
five becomes three.

727
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,786
And last I checked,
there's strength in numbers.

728
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,790
Here. Stay here.

729
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,212

- I'm gonna fix it.
- Don't leave me.

Don't worry.

(Amber whimpering )

746

When I knock on the hood,

754
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:57,171
you give the ignition a twist,
all right?

755

- Okay?
- Okay,

This will only
take a second, okay?

anything wrong.

Why don't you turn your lights on,
trigger-happy?

00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,460
Who said I was asking
for your opinion?

813

It would be nice to actually live.

You just killed the one person
who actually had a soul.

Yeah, well, what does that
make you?

818
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,795
Make sure she doesn't get
any ideas.

819
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,000
You got any ideas?

820
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,846
Come on, Denny.

821
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,008
Looks like you may be
the lucky one, bro.

Hey. Hey, dude, did you get
in an accident or something?

829
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,533
Exactly-- something.

830
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,123
I mean, do you need a ride?

831
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,263
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

832
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,436
Have you come up
with a plan yet, genius?

833
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,488
I need to think.

834
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,538

- Well, hello there.
- Evening.

837
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,882
Please don't tell me
you're here for directions.

838
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,219
I've got 15 rooms,
all with your name on 'em.

839
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,224
Just one, thanks.

840

- Are we playing 20-fucking-Questions?

841

How about number 3?

842
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,773
That's fine.

843
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,688
All I need is a credit card.

844
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,737
Of course.

845
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,878
Interesting name.

846
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,168
Isn't it?

847
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,552
Park anywhere you like.

848
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,384
You have a good night.

849
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,067
Hello, Sheriff.
This is Harris.

Flynn: We're driving down the lovely
country road, just you and me.

851
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,492
If they connect the dots,
we're dead ducks.

852
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:30,374
So Hoag and all that shit

853
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,455
never fucking happened.

854
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,542
Oh, the wheels of genius
are spinning.

855
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,875
And you, little missy...

856
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,422
You're gonna nod your head

857
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,931
like a good little girl.

858
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:50,561
So we're driving

859
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,220
and, holy shit,

860
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,891
we see a girl

861
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:58,060
crawling out of the woods
all fucked up.

862
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:01,105
We throw her inside
and we realize

863
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:05,572
we got us Emma fucking Ward.

864
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,782
Payday-

865
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,947
You're my payday-

866
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:16,211
So all we have to do now...

867
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:24,090
is kick up our dogs,

868
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:27,757
relax, freshen up.

869
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,640
Come first thing,

870
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,351
I'm taking you to Nashville.

871
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,936
Nashville?

872
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,899
You're taking me home?

873
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:51,280
You didn't think
that I'd just hand you in

874
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:55,793
to some backcountry
Johnny Law, did you?

875
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,544
No.

876
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,297
I'm gonna take you
straight to your daddy.

877
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,628
Because I want to get paid.

878
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,389
But I think you're worth
more than $2 million.

879
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,225
I think you're worth
at least five.

880
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,724
What do you think?

881
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,191
Come here.

882
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:27,029
Attagirl. Attagirl.

883
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,122
I have to pee.

884
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:45,175
I'll be right here.

( Water splattering )

886
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,896
The gun's right there.

887
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,612
Why now?

888
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,373
'Cause you won't make it home alive
if you don't.

889
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,458
So you'd kill him.
You hate him enough.

890
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,919
I don't want to find out
that I can't.

891
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,128
You're different.

892
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,578
Maybe I should just
kill you both.

893
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,876
All right, then.

894
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:16,304
I'll blow his fucking head off.

895
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,094
( Knocks on door)

896
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,932
What the fuck's
going on in here?

897
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,097
You guys having
a fucking sewing circle?

898
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,436
I told you I will cooperate.

899
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,981
You'd say anything,
wouldn't you?

900
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,402
I bet when that psycho had you

901
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,695
tied up under his bed,

902
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:40,832
you'd say all sorts
of pretty little lies, wouldn't you?

903
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,215
You saved my life, Emma.

904
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,296
I saved you to save myself,

905
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,306
nothing more.

906
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:59,468
Did you search me

907
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,353
for a key,

908
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:03,355
for a way out?

909
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,607
There was no key.

910
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,990
Because there was no lock.

911
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,661
Don't lie to me, Emma.

912
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,702
You had a choice.

913
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,870
You chose me.

914
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,674
( Door slams )

915
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,433
You don't lie to him,

916
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,593
not if you want to stay alive.

917
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,848
Well, I'm not afraid of him.

918
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,027
County sheriff.

919
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,866
Shit.

920
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,325
Get up.

921
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,830
County sheriff.
Open up, please.

922
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,340
Don't say a fucking word.

923
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,722
- Evening, Officer.
- Evening.

924
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:42,912
We have a problem.

925
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,699
It seems we have a case
of identity confusion.

926
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,585
The hotel manager recalls
someone checking in earlier

927
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,417
using the same name,
the same credit card.

928
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,423
Now if I could just check
your identification,

929
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,925
we could clear all this up.

930
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,390
( Tamara gagging )

931
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,834
(gunshot)

932
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,136
Let's go.

933
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,806
Tamara, get out here.

934
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,645
Shit.

935
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:03,698
He's here.

936
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,077

937
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,330

- Fuck.

938
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,990
Fuck!

939
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:11,159
Hey. HEY!

940
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,793
Turn around.

941
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,671
Where do you think
you're going?

942
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,423
( Car engine revs )

943
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,837

946
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,544
Help!

947
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:03,731
I'm done running.

948
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,524
Then come to me.

949
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,307
( Screams )

950
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,849

( screams )

957
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,052
Fuck.

958
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,286
I must admit

959
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,330
I did not see that coming.

960
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:28,125
And give him the honor
of killing you?

961
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,464
I don't think so.

962
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,629
Emma, come on.

963
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,882
We have something special.

964
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,926
Are you out of your mind?

965
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,471
I'm very much in my mind.

966
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,231
After all we've been through,

967
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,612
you're gonna go with this?

968
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,400
Don't you find it trite?

969
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:57,242
This isn't one of your
sociopathic stagings.

970
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:01,079
This is you dying.

971
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,084
If this were,

972
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:07,669
I don't know, say,
one of my "sociopathic stagings,"

973
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:11,255
I would have you say
exactly that.

974
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,763
And then

975
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,798
I would say, "Go ahead,

976
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:19,217
pull the trigger."

977
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,846
No problem.

figured out.

( Emma panting )

982
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,360
