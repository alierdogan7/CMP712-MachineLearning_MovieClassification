1
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:23,426
(sewing machine clicking)

2
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,616
(screaming)

3
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:52,958
(sobbing)

4
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,529
What's wrong
with my eye, Mama?

5
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,369
Mama: The doctor
says it's lazy.

6
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,466
But...

7
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,909
we're going to make you
look perfect.

8
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,451
It itches.

9
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:15,284
Do you want make friends?

10
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:18,447
Then keep it covered.

11
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:30,592
Are you a pirate?

12
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,439
(children muttering)

13
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,813
(school bell rings)

14
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:58,654
Man:
¶ Happy Birthday to you. ¶

15
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,996
I've always said,

16
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,803
"If you can't find
a friend,

17
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:11,276
make one."

18
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,575
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

19
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:18,876
(Mama sighs)

20
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,183
Now it's ruined.

21
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,787
Her name is Suzie.

22
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,959
Suzie was the first doll
I ever made.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,230
She was my best friend.

24
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,203
And now she'll be yours.

25
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,364
No, no, no,
you can't take her out.

26
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,400
She's special.

27
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,377
What do you think
of my pirate patch?

28
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,487
I bet you're wondering
what I'm making.

29
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,364
Okay, I'll tell you.
(giggles)

30
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,936
I saw someone today.

31
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,037
A boy.

32
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:23,207
You know how
when you meet someone...

33
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,416
and you think
you like them,

34
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,251
but then the more
you talk to them

35
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:30,950
you see parts
you don't like.

36
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,420
Like that guy
on the bench.

37
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:51,974
And sometimes...

38
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,941
you don't end up liking
any parts at all.

39
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,514
But...

40
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,586
the boy I saw today
is different.

41
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,592
I like every part of him.

42
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,731
Especially his hands.

43
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,600
They're beautiful.

44
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:27,269
Don't be mad.

45
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,443
You've been my friend
my whole life.

46
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,450
And you see me,
you always have, but...

47
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,287
I need a real friend.

48
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,621
Someone I can hold.

49
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,104
I'm going to give you
some cardboard shades

50
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,041
you can wear over
your regular glasses

51
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,011
until the dilation wears off.

52
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,876
Will my contacts be ready
by Friday?

53
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,541
Doctor:
Should be.

54
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,177
You look awfully excited.

55
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,914
I have a date.

56
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,883
You're sure my eye won't cross
with the contacts?

57
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,790
Positive.

58
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,988
The contacts will pull
your good eye forward

59
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,758
just like
your regular glasses.

60
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:19,788
Your lazy eye just needs
a little help.

61
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,765
I need all the help
I can get.

62
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,069
This boy is perfect.

63
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,690
¶ If I saw you ¶

64
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:49,126
¶ Now ¶

65
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,024
¶ Could I look in your ¶

66
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,366
¶ Eyes? ¶

67
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,509
¶ Do you think of me ¶

68
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,439
¶ Like I dream of you? ¶

69
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,780
¶ Do you wish you were here ¶

70
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,994
¶ Like I wish I... ¶

71
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,928
Oh, slick shades.

72
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,995
What the hell is a scupel?

73
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,198
- Scalpel?
- Oh!

74
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,400
Your dog's going
to be fine, ma'am.

75
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,967
(sighs)
Scalpel!

76
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,810
Thanks for the heads up, doll.

77
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,816
Scupel.

78
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,782
Man:
Wait! Hold 'em up!

79
00:06:55,628 --> 00:07:00,156
Moy, I need a big scupel
for German Shepard surgery tomorrow.

80
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,929
No forget it.
Prep it up for me.

81
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,479
Hey, May, hold up.

82
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,846
I want to ask you something.

83
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,716
What are you going
to be for Halloween?

84
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,982
I've just been wracking
my brains, you know,

85
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,081
trying to come up
with something original.

86
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,786
Do you got any ideas?

87
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,626
You have a beautiful neck.

88
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,533
Thank you.

89
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:45,104
You should call me
one of these nights.

90
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,079
You know,
we'll hang out and...

91
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,682
eat some melons
or something.

92
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,286
Okay.

93
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,305
(elevator dings)

94
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:53,837
¶ Come on, come on back
to me right now ¶

95
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:58,349
¶ Come on, come on,
come on ¶

96
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,983
¶ Do you love me now? ¶

97
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,658
¶ Did you love me before? ¶

98
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:15,833
¶ Do you love me now? ¶

99
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,263
When I left for vacation,

100
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,734
my dog had four legs.

101
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay?

102
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,401
Then I came back...

103
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:58,605
now she only has three.

104
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,038
You know,
I looked everywhere.

105
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,174
I can't find her leg.

106
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,946
What do I do?

107
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:08,078
May?

108
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:11,318
May, would you help
this gentleman?

109
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:13,484
You got to help me here, May.

110
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:16,393
I got a serious situation here, okay?

111
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,795
I got a dog,
it's missing a leg, okay?

112
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,766
I'm throwing it a stick
and nothing.

113
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:22,859
Nothing happens.

114
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:16,434
Hello?

115
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,034
Polly:
Jesus, what are you doing?

116
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,807
Relaxing.

117
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,976
Doesn't it hurt?

118
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,811
No.

119
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:04,679
Ow!

120
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:06,589
You crazy bitch!

121
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,617
Why did you do that?!

122
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,070
Actually...

123
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,437
I kind of liked it.

124
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,178
Do me again.

125
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,237
(giggles)

126
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,106
(flesh tearing)

127
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:34,051
(gasping)

128
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:38,120
Man:
It was in the rose bushes.

129
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:40,921
You can't just...

130
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,825
sew it back on...

131
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,930
can you?

132
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,767
I could.

133
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,386
Hello.

134
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:25,595
You can use me...

135
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,838
I mean, mine.

136
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,216
Thank you.

137
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:45,687
- What's your name?
- May.

138
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:48,091
Nice to meet you.
I'm Adam.

139
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,007
You want to smoke

140
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,440
a smoke with me?

141
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:10,579
You got to puff.

142
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,098
So, do you make
your own clothes?

143
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,932
Yes.

144
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,202
That's cool.

145
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,743
Thank you, Adam.

146
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,608
You're welcome, May.

147
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,611
I love your hands.

148
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,639
I think they're beautiful.

149
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,449
I used to be a hand model.

150
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:57,587
- I could see you doing that.
- I'm kidding, May.

151
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,224
(giggles)

152
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,339
Whoa!

153
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,433
(dryer buzzes)

154
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,662
Oh!

155
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,300
Well...

156
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:57,084
Race cars.

157
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,954
What's that?

158
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:02,190
Oh, yeah.

159
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:04,093
My, uh...

160
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,961
girlfriend bought me these.

161
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,137
Anyway.

162
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,912
You know, I meant,
my ex-girlfriend...

163
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:25,883
bought them for me.

164
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,456
Practice.

165
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,585
I'll see you around, May.

166
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,795
(dryer buzzes)

167
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,137
"Hey, see you around, right?"

168
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:53,472
I'm so sorry that...

169
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,844
I tripped in front of you

170
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,348
at the coffee shop.

171
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,080
Maybe we could...

172
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:05,315
we could do something.

173
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,154
(giggles)

174
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,596
"See you around."

175
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,571
"See you around, right?"

176
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:47,589
Hello, happy!

177
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:53,431
Dr. Zarkizein needs you
to do a fecosam

178
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,337
on the miscitta.

179
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,535
Does that make
any sense to you?

180
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:00,545
Fecal exam on Miss Kitty.
No problem.

181
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,891
Oh, excuse me.

182
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,521
Hey!

183
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:20,361
What's up, May?

184
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,628
I was just about to...

185
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,206
about to have lunch.
Wow, you look great!

186
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,375
You hungry?

187
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:37,473
I will cut.

188
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:41,718
And you pick.

189
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,926
Good choice.

190
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,987
So what do you do, May?

191
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,094
I work at the animal hospital.

192
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,105
And I sew.

193
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:04,075
Okay.
Animal hospital.

194
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,101
Some people think
it's kind of gross.

195
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:08,977
I love gross.

196
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:10,606
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,344
Disgust me, please.

198
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,919
Okay.

199
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,325
A couple of weeks ago,
this old man comes in

200
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,659
and says his dog is dying.

201
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,927
And he begs us to save it.

202
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:29,764
A 90-pound black Lab
named Seymour.

203
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:32,202
We take him in
and run some tests

204
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:34,364
and we find that he has
a twisted bowel.

205
00:21:34,406 --> 00:21:37,432
And he needs
to be operated on immediately.

206
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:39,910
So, we shave Seymour's tummy,

207
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,776
we cut him open

208
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,078
and we take out a piece
of intestine about,

209
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:46,380
about the size of a hot-dog.

210
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,246
Everything went smooth,

211
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,018
but...

212
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,954
when we went to sew
Seymour back up,

213
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:57,019
we realized we were out
of the heavy sutures

214
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,155
that you're supposed to use
for large dogs.

215
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,632
So the doctor decided
if we tripled up

216
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,862
on cat sutures
that should do the trick.

217
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,668
Well,

218
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,401
a few days go by

219
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,705
and the old man calls up

220
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,144
hysterical.

221
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:18,116
The cat sutures had burst
when he was at work.

222
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,879
And by the time he got home,

223
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:23,820
Seymour was sprawled out
on the back porch

224
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:26,222
with his guts spread
all over the concrete.

225
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,387
And the fence
was soaked in blood

226
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,329
all the way around the yard.

227
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:40,795
It was a mess.

228
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,641
I had to sew that one back up.

229
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:04,192
So, I guess your job
takes lots of guts.

230
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,462
Lots.

231
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,409
Why are those kids touching
everything like that?

232
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,741
Adam:
They're blind kids.

233
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,973
They're from the day care center
around the block.

234
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,252
Dang, I got to go.

235
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:30,153
There's an Argenta playing
at the Beverly in 15 minutes.

236
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:33,352
I took the afternoon off.
They're showing "Trauma."

237
00:23:33,392 --> 00:23:36,054
- Is that a movie?
- You've never seen "Trauma"?

238
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,129
Don't go.

239
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,632
What?

240
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,770
Nothing.

241
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,208
I should probably get back
to work, anyway.

242
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:55,372
Thank you for the sandwich...

243
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:58,244
and the cigarette.

244
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,251
I got to see this movie,

245
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:02,913
but maybe I can
see you again sometime.

246
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:07,582
How about tonight?

247
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,521
I got this thing tonight, but...

248
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,590
- maybe after.
- Great!

249
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:22,536
All right.
I look forward to it, May.

250
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,846
You want to take it with you?

251
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:43,646
Thanks for the advice, doll.

252
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,100
So...

253
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,830
what were you doing to me
that day at the coffee shop?

254
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:04,542
I'm so embarrassed.

255
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:06,271
Why?

256
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,743
I've never had
a boyfriend before.

257
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,324
Do you like me, Adam?

258
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:26,254
Sure, I do.

259
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,765
You don't think I'm weird?

260
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,276
I do think you're weird.

261
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:46,107
- I knew that.
- I like weird.

262
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,945
I like weird a lot.

263
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:06,431
You are perfect, aren't you?

264
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,268
Nobody's perfect.

265
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:12,607
You're perfect.

266
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,514
You want to see my room?

267
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:31,528
Does this stuff freak you out?

268
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,933
Nothing freaks me out.

269
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,339
That's right, it wouldn't,
would it?

270
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,413
You're on to me.

271
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:07,088
I'm a psycho.

272
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:22,410
Got you.

273
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,353
It's pretty cool, huh?

274
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,616
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

275
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,753
Who taught you how to kiss?

276
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,728
Suzie.

277
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:58,432
Who taught you how to kiss?!

278
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:01,105
(glass breaks)

279
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:02,909
Ah!

280
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,789
(crackling)

281
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,508
(cat meows)

282
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:43,914
What's the haps, doll?

283
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,219
What happened to your hand?

284
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,592
Scupel.

285
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,933
(giggles)

286
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:01,472
You're funny.

287
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:06,035
You want to watch me file?

288
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,319
Hey.

289
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,847
We got the whole place
to ourselves.

290
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:22,860
Let's dance.

291
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,631
(music plays)

292
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:33,934
(humming)

293
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:35,872
(dogs barking)

294
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,397
(giggling)

295
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:39,535
Listen, they're serenading us.

296
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,705
We have to dance now.

297
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,446
Oh.

298
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:49,385
Please, please, please.

299
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,082
Please.

300
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,741
So, are you going
to dance with me or what?

301
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:27,648
- Do you like pussy?
- What?!

302
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,523
Cats?

303
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:32,359
Do you like pussycats?

304
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:36,265
Jeez, you're a nasty
little thing, aren't you?

305
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,969
Do you like Lupe?

306
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,998
My landlady's a real bitch.

307
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,101
I have to get rid of her.

308
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,310
Your landlady?

309
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:53,045
No, dummy, the cat.

310
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:01,258
You're her only hope.

311
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:07,587
Oh, come on.

312
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,396
Lupe will keep you company
when you're all alone.

313
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,699
Besides,

314
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:14,830
she'll remind you of me.

315
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:18,666
- Okay.
- Wonderful!

316
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,112
Oh, look at the time.

317
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,281
I have to go.

318
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,147
It's girls' night out tonight.

319
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:35,318
You want to come?

320
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,123
I know.

321
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:39,062
You need your beauty rest.

322
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,293
Not much of it, though.

323
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:04,111
Recording: Please leave
a message after the scream.

324
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:06,089
(screaming)

325
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:12,252
Hello, Adam, this is May.

326
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:16,590
I was just wondering
if you would like to be together again...

327
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,499
(glass cracking)

328
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,636
(sighs)

329
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,767
Get together again sometime.

330
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,344
I had such a good time last night.

331
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:33,646
742-5663.
That's my number.

332
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,550
Call me.

333
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:37,555
Anytime.

334
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,451
I look forward
to seeing you again.

335
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:14,018
¶ Yes ¶

336
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:18,461
¶ What is it, my love? ¶

337
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,431
¶ He said,
"It's nothing ¶

338
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:23,991
¶ Nothing really ¶

339
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:29,166
¶ Just wanted to hear ¶

340
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:34,770
¶ Your cute voice ¶

341
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:39,375
¶ To know you are near" ¶

342
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:13,574
¶ And he calls me "kitten" ¶

343
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:16,109
¶ Kitten ¶

344
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:17,314
¶ When it's quiet and... ¶

345
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:20,720
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

346
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,487
May, you scared the hell
out of me!

347
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,654
What are you doing out here?

348
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:26,596
Nothing.

349
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,158
How long have you been
standing out here?

350
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,760
Since about 2:00.

351
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:41,040
You haven't really been standing out here
for two hours, have you?

352
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,341
What do you think?

353
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,552
Look, I got your message.

354
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:50,747
I'm sorry I haven't
called you back.

355
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,915
I've been really busy
with this movie.

356
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:54,891
You made a movie?

357
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:58,453
In college before I dropped out.
I just finished putting it together.

358
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,121
Can I see it?

359
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:05,062
I'll make you macaroni and cheese.

360
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:09,601
Go to a movie, huh?

361
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,302
Sounds like a date.

362
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,449
I dig your place.

363
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:22,715
It's really...

364
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,654
neat.

365
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,730
Is this Gatorade?

366
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,736
Cool.

367
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:54,911
You'll never believe
what I had to do at work today.

368
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:03,688
You ready?

369
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:05,457
Roll 'em.

370
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,396
Roll 'em.

371
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,758
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

372
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:15,364
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

373
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:19,433
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

374
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:23,243
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

375
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:26,648
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

376
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:34,254

00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:38,490
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

378
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:42,158
¶ Hey, my baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

379
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,966
¶ My baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

380
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:49,735
¶ Hey, my baby does the Hanky Panky ¶

381
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:57,505
¶ I saw her walking on
down the line ¶

382
00:38:57,548 --> 00:39:00,813
¶ You know I saw her
for the very first time ¶

383
00:39:00,852 --> 00:39:04,447
¶ A pretty little girl
standing all alone ¶

384
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:08,585
¶ Hey, pretty baby,
can I take you home? ¶

385
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:12,460
¶ I never saw her,
never ever saw her ¶

386
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:19,699
¶ My baby does
the Hanky Panky ¶

387
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:24,071
¶ Yeah, my baby does
the Hanky Panky ¶

388
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:27,874

389
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:31,746

00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:35,275

391
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,446
¶ Let s go! ¶

392
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,479
(guitar solo)

393
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:05,882
Adam: So?

394
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,748
What did you think?

395
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:12,987
It was sweet.

396
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:19,324
It was sweet?

397
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,236
I don't think
she could have gotten

398
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:29,865
his whole finger
in one bite, though.

399
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:34,334
That part was kind
of far-fetched.

400
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,782
¶ Oh ¶

401
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,720
¶ Last flight ¶

402
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,885
¶ Get lost in the moss ¶

403
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,185
¶ Oh, oh ¶

404
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:58,390
¶ Fall in the neon mine ¶

405
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,005
¶ Push me down ¶

406
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,564
¶ Push me down ¶

407
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,372
¶ Push me down ¶

408
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,949
Okay, okay, breathe

409
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:28,463
¶ Still rolling in the stones ¶

410
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:31,559
¶ Run to the log that s rotten ¶

411
00:41:31,602 --> 00:41:33,900
¶ Oh, oh ¶

412
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,543
¶ Your soft belly bossing lows ¶

413
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:44,676
¶ Push me down ¶

414
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:46,546
¶ Push me down ¶

415
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,575
¶ Push me down ¶

416
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,766
Oh, God damn it!

417
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:19,550
What the fuck is that?

418
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:26,017
- Oh, fuck, I'm bleeding.
- I know.

419
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,825
May, what are you doing?

420
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:36,933
Please.
I need a towel.

421
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:59,286
I think...
I think I'm gonna go.

422
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:02,453
What?

423
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:06,756
I'll see you around.

424
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:10,490
But it's just like your movie.

425
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,627
May, this is weird.

426
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,705
You like weird.

427
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:18,799
Not that weird.

428
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:30,013
(distant whispering)

429
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:32,022
(glass cracking)

430
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,783
(glass crashes)

431
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,455
May: I told you to face
the goddamn wall!

432
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:02,643
Oops!
It fall down.

433
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,382
Moy, you help me.

434
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:09,025
Doctor, this delivery guy
is insisting

435
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,459
that you sign for this.

436
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:12,860
I'm in surgery, Polly,
please!

437
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:21,594
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
Kitty live now.

438
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,505
- Man: What are you doing?
- Adam: What?

439
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,447
Take it outside, man.

440
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:37,318
So, what's up, bro'?
What do you think?

441
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:39,346
Adam:
Fuck, she's pretty.

442
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,756
I don't think she's playing
with a full deck.

443
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:44,886
- That's not what you wanted.
- True.

444
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:48,056
At least you know
she's not out of her mind.

445
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,795
You know what,
we're not talking about May anymore.

446
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:53,167
I've successfully escaped
that lunatic.

447
00:44:53,204 --> 00:44:54,899
Woman:
Who's May?

448
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,702
Man: Some weird chick
Adam just dumped.

449
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:00,540
How's your lip?

450
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,910
Adam: Stow it, all right?
Would you, please?

451
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:06,075
Woman:
I see. May I?

452
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:08,108
Man:
So what if she likes your hands?

453
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:09,813
Just keep them away
from her face.

454
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,584
Adam:
You're a prick, you know that?

455
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:15,285
- Yeah, do some more pushups.
- Man: Fuck you.

456
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:21,060
(phone beeps)
What's up, doll?

457
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:23,032
This is Polly.

458
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,626
I'm just sitting here
in my nightie.

459
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,434
I wanted to know
how my little puss-puss was.

460
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:33,603
Come on over
if you get this, okay?

461
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,589
What's giving you
the sads, doll?

462
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,695
Oh.

463
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:54,493
No frumpy faces allowed
in this place.

464
00:45:57,468 --> 00:46:01,336
¶ When it's quiet under ¶

465
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:06,107
¶ I say, yes, yes, yes ¶

466
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:12,141
¶ What is it, my heart? ¶

467
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:14,708
¶ He says nothing ¶

468
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:17,346
¶ Not really ¶

469
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:21,825
¶ It's just I miss you so ¶

470
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:26,727
¶ You know how. ¶

471
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:29,562
I wanted to kiss you
since I first saw you.

472
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:37,832
Is this what was bugging you?

473
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,379
I wasn't bugged.

474
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,848
Just angry at someone.

475
00:46:53,891 --> 00:46:56,018
Not me, I hope.

476
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:01,260
No, not you.

477
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,062
Do you feel weird doing this?

478
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:12,671
I am weird.

479
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,479
I love weird.

480
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,785
Are you serious?

481
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:26,619
Yeah.

482
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:29,622
About me?

483
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:33,525
Dead.

484
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:10,090
¶ He calls me kitten ¶

485
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:12,125
¶ Kitten ¶

486
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:15,935
¶ In the middle of the night ¶

487
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:22,111
¶ I say yes, yes, yes ¶

488
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:27,607
¶ What is it, my life? ¶

489
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:33,112
¶ He says,
"Nothing, not really, ¶

490
00:48:33,157 --> 00:48:37,560
¶ For the angels I wish ¶

491
00:48:37,595 --> 00:48:43,625
¶ For the angels
that took you ¶

492
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:48,661
¶ The angels I wish. ¶

493
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:08,988
Can you help us
with something?

494
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:14,629
I saw some kids playing
in the park

495
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:16,633
and I was wondering
if I could volunteer

496
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,498
to help watch them.

497
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:22,369
What kind of kids were they?
Retarded, deaf, crippled, dumb?

498
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:24,135
They were blind.

499
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,641
So you want to work
at the day care center?

500
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:27,871
Would it be the same kids?

501
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,176
What's the difference?
You only like a certain type of blind kids?

502
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,679
(children singing)

503
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:43,689
May Kennedy?
Lucille.

504
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:45,718
Let's introduce you
to the kids.

505
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:49,597
Do you think
I could meet her first?

506
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,601
Lucille:
Who, Petey? We can try.

507
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:53,626
She usually likes being left alone.

508
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,764
Nobody likes to be alone.

509
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:59,003
Hey, Petey, I got someone here
who wants to meet you.

510
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:01,102
Go away, sniggel-head.

511
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,636
You are so mean to me, Petey.

512
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:06,713
Good luck.

513
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:25,167
What are you making, Petey?

514
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,999
Ashtray.

515
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:29,904
You smoke?

516
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:31,463
No.

517
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:34,944
Then who are you making
the ash tray for, Petey?

518
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,714
You smoke.

519
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:42,881
Yes, I do.

520
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,785
Then you can have it
when I'm done.

521
00:51:16,787 --> 00:51:18,482
How you doing, May?

522
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:23,991
Great, actually.

523
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:26,120
Making new friends.

524
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,764
Right and left.

525
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:30,733
Lovely.

526
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,801
Lupe,

527
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:36,567
this is Adam.

528
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,572
It's cute.

529
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,806
How are you doing?

530
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:49,107
Aw, man, this thing is broke.

531
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:51,314
I'm gonna have to go down
to the Fluff and Fold.

532
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:55,822
Call me sometime?

533
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,885
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you around, May.

534
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:24,610
(machine starts)

535
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:46,071
May!

536
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:48,202
What's up?

537
00:52:48,245 --> 00:52:50,975
Woman:
Who is it, Polly?

538
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:54,139
Who is that?

539
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:59,110
An opportunity
I just couldn't pass up.

540
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:02,487
Oh.

541
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:04,494
You want to join us?

542
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:10,263
Well, then can we do
something tomorrow, May?

543
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,359
I got to hit this.

544
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:17,934
I don't understand.

545
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,713
You're jealous!

546
00:53:25,582 --> 00:53:28,745
- What's going on out there?
- Shut up, hooker!

547
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,849
Oh, May, look.

548
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:36,724
I can kick her out
if you really want me to.

549
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,194
You know you're my main mama.

550
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,105
(glass cracking)

551
00:53:59,149 --> 00:54:01,276
(sobbing)

552
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,278
(coughs)

553
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:53,428
Come here, Lup.
Come here.

554
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:55,862
Come on.

555
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:00,669
Come on, girl, it's been
a really rough couple of days.

556
00:55:01,678 --> 00:55:03,771
(hisses)

557
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:13,079
(clay shatters)

558
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,363
(glass cracks)

559
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:27,059
Shut up!

560
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,473
(cracking stops)

561
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:39,379
Thank you.

562
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:44,684
(phone beeping)

563
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:54,957
Adam: Hello?

564
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:57,762
- Is Adam there?
- Hey, what's up?

565
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:59,860
Not much.

566
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:01,894
How did you know it was me?

567
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:06,606
Hello?

568
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:08,770
Who is this?

569
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:10,746
May, silly.

570
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:12,646
(glass cracking)

571
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:17,910
What are you doing tonight?

572
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,290
Hello?

573
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,385
Why?

574
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:27,260
(cracking intensifies)

575
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,356
I was just thinking
we could get together

576
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:31,264
and do something.

577
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:33,269
I have plans.

578
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:36,705
- (glass breaks)
- Oh.

579
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,731
Quiet!

580
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:40,834
Hello? Who are you talking to?

581
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,839
May:
What about tomorrow night?

582
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:47,610
Adam: Maybe.

583
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,518
Maybe?

584
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:52,852
Okay, what time?
I'll wait.

585
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,618
Don't do that.

586
00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:56,717
No, no, no. It's okay.
I'll wait.

587
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,962
I got to go, May.

588
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:01,793
(giggles)

589
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:05,393
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you
tomorrow then.

590
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,561
Goodbye, May.

591
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:19,739
(glass rattles)

592
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:43,603
I hate you.

593
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,007
May:
Who can tell me what this is?

594
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:51,107
Girl:
We don't know, May, what is it?

595
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:54,083
Petey, come here and see
if you can figure it out.

596
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:11,158
I don't know.

597
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:13,362
Come on, Petey,
you can try harder than that.

598
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:14,893
I don't know.

599
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:19,869
All right,
I'll tell you what it is.

600
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:22,571
Girl:
What, what is it?

601
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:27,239
This is my best friend.

602
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,646
My best friend.

603
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:35,920
And I didn't even realize it
until just last night.

604
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:40,191
It's just a box.

605
00:58:42,265 --> 00:58:45,063
- Her friend must be inside.
- That's very good, Deirdre.

606
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:46,932
Petey:
Take it out.

607
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,268
I can't.

608
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:51,797
- Why not?
- I just can't.

609
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:55,600
Come on, May, let it out.
We want to meet your friend.

610
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:57,670
No, l...

611
00:58:57,714 --> 00:59:00,683
I can't. She's special.
She doesn't come out.

612
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:03,810
She always stays in.
She's very fragile.

613
00:59:05,889 --> 00:59:07,720
Petey.

614
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,863
Stop it!

615
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:27,569
- She's out!
- No!

616
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:29,738
- The floor!
- Glass!

617
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,474
Don't!

618
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:37,078
Glass! Ow!

619
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,747
(screaming)

620
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:01,694
(phone ringing)

621
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,340
May's voice:
This is May Kennedy.

622
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:11,472
Please leave your numbers.

623
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:14,340
(phone beeps)

624
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:17,478
Polly:
Hello. Where are you, doll?

625
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,114
I think Dr. Zarkizein is upset.

626
01:01:20,156 --> 01:01:22,716
Either that or he has
a kidney infection.

627
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:24,420
I'm not sure.

628
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:27,055
Either way, you need to get
your cute butt in here.

629
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:28,962
You've missed two days
in a row.

630
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:30,694
Are you all right?

631
01:01:30,734 --> 01:01:32,861
I miss you. Kisses.

632
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:34,767
Call me, okay?

633
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:08,337
Ah.

634
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,449
Oh, Lupe.

635
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:34,923
I'll miss petting your pretty fur.

636
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,931
Are you okay?

637
01:03:18,942 --> 01:03:21,968
So many pretty parts
and no pretty holes.

638
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:25,843
No shit.
What's your name?

639
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:32,117
It doesn't matter.

640
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:39,727
Hey, you want to go get
some Jujubes with me?

641
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:43,295
What's the point?

642
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,771
I'm just trying to be friendly.

643
01:03:48,805 --> 01:03:50,796
Sorry.

644
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:01,249
Hmm...

645
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:09,080
Shit, man,
I can live off of these.

646
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,296
It's getting hella hot.

647
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,307
You mind if I take off my shirt?

648
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:29,343
- Do what you want.
- All right.

649
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:41,852
I love your tattoo.

650
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:45,352
Thanks.

651
01:04:45,395 --> 01:04:47,295
Ah.

652
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:52,465
Fuck!
I'm still burning up.

653
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:56,330
Do you have any ice cubes
I can rub on my nipples?

654
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,238
May: Freeze!

655
01:05:06,282 --> 01:05:07,977
That's the idea.

656
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:09,917
Stop!

657
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:15,954
What the fuck is that?

658
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,861
- A friend.
- Whoa.

659
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:23,058
This is some sick shit.

660
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,726
So...

661
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:28,396
are we best friends now that
you've seen what's inside my freezer?

662
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:30,770
You fucking freak.

663
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,773
I'm not going to be your friend.

664
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,711
(sobbing)

665
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:58,266
(screaming)

666
01:06:44,947 --> 01:06:47,279
I need more parts.

667
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:03,161
Adam:
Hey, May.

668
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,224
Hey, dude, what's up?

669
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,301
Not much.

670
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,208
What are you reading about?

671
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:16,040
Amputation.

672
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:19,271
- Is that for work?
- Nope.

673
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:21,374
It's just for fun.

674
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:31,686
Listen, May,

675
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:34,424
I'm sorry things didn't work out
between us.

676
01:07:35,765 --> 01:07:37,756
L... you know.
It just didn't feel right.

677
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,133
It doesn't feel right,
you know?

678
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,104
I understand now...

679
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,365
Adam.

680
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:49,936
I understand.

681
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:56,979
Friends?

682
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:10,627
Okay. All right.

683
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,463
I really have to go.

684
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:15,333
Later hands.

685
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,337
Right. All right.
See you around.

686
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:36,688
How's Lupe?

687
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:41,395
- In pieces.
- Is she sad about something?

688
01:08:41,431 --> 01:08:43,422
She does get depressed.

689
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,000
- She doesn't seem happy.
- Oh.

690
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:51,803
Can I ask what you're doing?

691
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,704
I want to make

692
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:57,736
a blouse for you.

693
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:01,739
Kind of an apology present
for the other night and my behavior.

694
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:04,844
Oh, May, that is so sweet.

695
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:07,082
Polly, are you back there, sweetie?

696
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:08,886
Polly:
Back here.

697
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:13,058
Did you bring my lunch?

698
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,563
Oh...

699
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:26,397
May, I would like you to meet
a new friend of mine.

700
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:29,306
Her name's Ambrosia.

701
01:09:29,345 --> 01:09:31,540
Nice gams.

702
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:34,481
Aren't they?

703
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:40,021
Can I get a few more measurements?

704
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:44,692
Have you ever thought
about having this removed?

705
01:09:44,727 --> 01:09:47,753
My grandma said it's imperfections
that make you special.

706
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:54,263
What do you think?

707
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:03,369
Freak.

708
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:05,607
(giggling)

709
01:10:05,648 --> 01:10:07,878
(muttering)

710
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:37,574
Hello, Polly, this is May.
Happy Halloween.

711
01:10:39,015 --> 01:10:42,041
I was thinking about popping by later
to bring you your new blouse.

712
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:45,945
Show you my costume.

713
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,794
Give me a call if that's cool.
Miss you.

714
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:04,862
Kisses.

715
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:05,896
Call me, okay?

716
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:18,018
If you can't find a friend,

717
01:11:18,054 --> 01:11:19,988
make one.

718
01:11:26,796 --> 01:11:28,787
Hello, May.

719
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,594
Hello, Polly.

720
01:11:31,968 --> 01:11:33,959
Slick duds.

721
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:35,732
Thank you.

722
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:38,137
I was going to call you tonight,
but...

723
01:11:39,742 --> 01:11:41,471
I've been so busy.

724
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,137
What are you doing right now?

725
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:44,976
Nothing.

726
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:48,412
I'm starting to understand
what the doctor's saying

727
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:50,681
20% of the time now.

728
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:57,187
It's funny because I always thought
it was the doctor's writing

729
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,319
that was supposed
to be incomprehensible.

730
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:02,727
Maybe it's different
with animal doctors.

731
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:07,926
Ah, that's better.

732
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:11,300
(chuckles)

733
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:17,674
Are you expecting someone?

734
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,441
Did you forget my blouse?

735
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:26,948
No?!

736
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:35,590
You're not sore about me
and Ambrosia, are you?

737
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:38,328
I'm not sore.

738
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:40,358
You understand
it's not serious, right?

739
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:42,530
It's just a piece of ass.

740
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,335
Whoa!

741
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,775
Whoa.

742
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:54,676
Oh, please don't hurt me, May.

743
01:12:54,717 --> 01:12:56,446
Pleasey-please.

744
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,588
I trust you.

745
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:12,294
I know you would
never hurt me, May.

746
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,305
Ambrosia:
What are you doing here?

747
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:55,173
Where's Polly?

748
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:58,674
In the head.

749
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:01,950
Polly, hurry up in there!

750
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:06,318
I've been drinking vodka all night
and I have to piss like a racehorse!

751
01:14:06,355 --> 01:14:07,617
(laughs sarcastically)

752
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,251
You have really beautiful legs.

753
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,363
I thought they were gams?

754
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,761
Gams, stems, wheels,
whatever.

755
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:31,170
Give us a little spin, doll.

756
01:14:32,348 --> 01:14:33,610
Huh?

757
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:35,879
Turn around for me.

758
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:38,182
You are so fucking weird.

759
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,980
I don't know
what Polly sees in you.

760
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:45,754
Polly doesn't see anything.

761
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:48,491
Turn around, Miss Grable.

762
01:14:49,799 --> 01:14:51,699
Okay, doll.

763
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:03,044
How was that?

764
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,343
Beautiful.

765
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,227
Sweet costume.

766
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:29,260
You got any cold ones
in there?

767
01:15:29,305 --> 01:15:31,432
Yes, I do.

768
01:16:17,253 --> 01:16:18,811
What are you doing here?

769
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:30,622
Hello.
Anyone home?

770
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:33,598
I need them, Adam.

771
01:16:35,271 --> 01:16:38,365
Listen, sister,
Adam's taken for the evening.

772
01:16:39,942 --> 01:16:41,842
I like your earrings.

773
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:45,242
Thanks.

774
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:46,771
Nice costume.

775
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,475
Thank you.
I made it myself.

776
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:54,445
Just like one
of your movies, Adam.

777
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,082
May...

778
01:16:57,626 --> 01:17:00,925
what are you doing here?

779
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:02,897
This is May?

780
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:07,558
Do you want to come in
for a drink or something?

781
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:14,569
Thank you.

782
01:17:25,587 --> 01:17:27,578
(sighs)

783
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:32,187
You should have called.

784
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:34,195
Would you have answered?

785
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:36,356
If I was home, yes.

786
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:39,196
Doesn't matter.
I didn't come here to see you.

787
01:17:39,234 --> 01:17:41,065
Vodka okay?

788
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,468
Sounds great.

789
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:57,684
Did something happen?

790
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,550
Touch me.

791
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:05,422
Touch my face.

792
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:08,458
(giggles)

793
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:11,193
Go on, Adam, touch my face.

794
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:19,099
- Stop that!
- These hands are mine now, honey.

795
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:20,938
No, they are mine, quagledoo.

796
01:18:20,976 --> 01:18:23,570
Fuck you. What is that,
Russian or something?

797
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:28,914
Touch my face.

798
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,081
Yeah, fucking go on, asshole.

799
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:36,318
Fucking touch away,
I don't give a shit.

800
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,093
Um...

801
01:18:48,837 --> 01:18:50,566
Okay,

802
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:52,471
I'm pretty drunk

803
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:55,136
and I'm feeling queasy
and I just wish you would leave.

804
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,579
Fine, you know what,
I'm out of here.

805
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,742
Not you, dumbshit.

806
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:04,919
Dumbshit?

807
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,887
I guess that would be me.

808
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:10,214
You're not going to touch
my face?

809
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:18,723
Fine, I'll touch your face.

810
01:19:23,372 --> 01:19:25,340
(yells)

811
01:19:47,896 --> 01:19:50,091
You're going to look perfect.

812
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:02,601
(grunts)

813
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:14,424
You have all of the parts.

814
01:23:19,107 --> 01:23:21,098
Words can't describe.

815
01:23:26,615 --> 01:23:29,243
But I don't have
to talk to you, do I?

816
01:23:31,019 --> 01:23:32,543
I can just...

817
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:34,646
feel.

818
01:23:36,024 --> 01:23:40,723
And you'll feel it right here, too.

819
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,938
(gasping)

820
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:58,274
Right.

821
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:05,943
You can't see me.

822
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,935
Can't see me.

823
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,129
(sobbing)

824
01:26:20,755 --> 01:26:22,746
(screaming)

825
01:27:01,563 --> 01:27:03,554
See me!

826
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,066
All I want...

827
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:14,732
is see me.

828
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:25,242
What...

829
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,751
(screaming)

830
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:50,598
¶ Bring us all the children ¶

831
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:54,700
¶ Because they are sweet ¶

832
01:28:54,743 --> 01:28:58,702
¶ Toss them up into the air ¶

833
01:28:58,747 --> 01:29:02,877
¶ They come down and swing their feet ¶

834
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:06,717
¶ Twirling all the while ¶

835
01:29:06,755 --> 01:29:11,283
¶ Tumbling in a pile ¶

836
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:19,056
¶ They are good ¶

837
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:23,332
¶ What a treat ¶

838
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:27,364
¶ Bring us all the children ¶

839
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:31,436
¶ Just when they are sweet ¶

840
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:35,711
¶ Wanderlust and packed with pride ¶

841
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:39,686
¶ When they laugh and go inside ¶

842
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:43,680
¶ Echoing all the while ¶

843
01:29:43,725 --> 01:29:47,855
¶ Tumbling in a pile ¶

844
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,834
¶ They are good ¶

845
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:59,863
¶ Good to eat ¶

846
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:04,242
¶ Bring us all the children ¶

847
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:08,306
¶ Even when they're not so sweet ¶

848
01:30:08,349 --> 01:30:12,445
¶ Toss them up into the air ¶

849
01:30:12,487 --> 01:30:16,753
¶ They come down and get a treat ¶

850
01:30:20,562 --> 01:30:24,362
¶ Bringing tea ¶

851
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:28,699
¶ A good night's sleep ¶

852
01:30:28,737 --> 01:30:34,004
¶ It goes away. ¶

853
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:46,486
¶... Love you ¶

854
01:30:46,521 --> 01:30:52,084
¶ You were perfect,
and you were made to be ¶

855
01:30:52,127 --> 01:30:55,654
¶ That's all, that's all
we had to do ¶

856
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:58,598
¶ That's all, that's all
we had to see ¶

857
01:30:58,633 --> 01:31:01,602
¶ That's all, that's all
you faked, you weaved ¶

858
01:31:01,636 --> 01:31:05,504
¶ Walls and walls and walls
and walls and walls ¶

859
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:08,634
¶ Things that I see ¶

860
01:31:08,676 --> 01:31:11,736
¶ Don't know what they mean ¶

861
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,874
¶ But this I threw in ¶

862
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:18,147
¶ Good to be all caught up ¶

863
01:31:18,186 --> 01:31:23,214
¶ With no place to go ¶

864
01:31:23,258 --> 01:31:26,125
¶ You were carried away with the words ¶

865
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:30,154
¶ And I couldn't follow ¶

866
01:31:30,198 --> 01:31:35,932
¶ They were made up,
yet used so cautiously ¶

867
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,428
¶ You were perfect in every way ¶

868
01:31:39,474 --> 01:31:42,705
¶ You were made to love me ¶

869
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:46,145
¶ Well, that's all,
that's all we had to do ¶

870
01:31:46,181 --> 01:31:48,809
¶ That's all, that's all
we had to see ¶

871
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:51,910
¶ I saw, I saw you
straight through these ¶

872
01:31:51,953 --> 01:31:56,049
¶ Walls and walls and walls
and walls and walls ¶

873
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:58,957
¶ Things that I see ¶

874
01:31:58,993 --> 01:32:02,485
¶ Don't know what they mean ¶

875
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:05,260
¶ But this I threw in ¶

876
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,531
¶ Good to be all caught up ¶

877
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:13,735
¶ With no place to go ¶

878
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:16,539
¶ And the only thing that I know ¶

879
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:20,571
¶ I was made to love you ¶

880
01:32:30,959 --> 01:32:34,053
¶ The things that I see ¶

881
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:37,258
¶ Don't know what they mean ¶

882
01:32:37,298 --> 01:32:40,267
¶ But this I threw in ¶

883
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:43,634
¶ Good to be all dolled up ¶

884
01:32:43,671 --> 01:32:47,607
¶ The things that we see ¶

885
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:50,475
¶ You never come clean ¶

886
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:53,537
¶ But you know what we mean ¶

887
01:32:53,581 --> 01:32:56,914
¶ Good to be broken ¶

888
01:32:56,951 --> 01:33:00,182
¶ Good to be broken ¶

889
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:03,554
¶ Good to be broken ¶

890
01:33:03,591 --> 01:33:06,788
¶ Good to be broken ¶

891
01:33:06,828 --> 01:33:10,320
¶ Good to be broken ¶

892
01:33:10,365 --> 01:33:13,528
¶ Good to be broken ¶

893
01:33:13,568 --> 01:33:16,969
¶ Good to be broken ¶

894
01:33:17,005 --> 01:33:20,236
¶ Good to be broken ¶

895
01:33:20,275 --> 01:33:23,938
¶ Good to be. ¶
