Richie, you're so full of shit.

183
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:04,116
I'm getting some air.

184
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:06,216
Wait up.

185
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,252
RICHIE: Hey, wait. Don't go.

186
00:20:08,352 --> 00:20:10,089
It's moving.

187
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,623
It's waving to ya.

188
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:14,018
[Squeaks] Goodbye! Goodbye!

189
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,004
BUZZ: So long, fella.

190
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:27,168
BUZZ: Damn!

191
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,703
- RICHIE: What?
- Bastard bit me!

192
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,907
Come on. What?

193
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,775
It bit me. Look at that.

194
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:39,949
Asshole!

195
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,152
Hey, watch who you're calling asshole.

196
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,252
Asshole.

197
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,092
Liz'll clean you up.

198
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:59,127
[Hysterical cackling]

199
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,941
Come on in and see Daisy May,
our two-headed cow.

200
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,078
See a sheep with six legs.

201
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:12,748
Yes, six.
Count 'em yourself, six legs.

202
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:16,986
And these are creatures of God,
ladies and gentlemen, not man.

203
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:20,219
All authentic and all alive.

204
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,261
Inside, behind that lovely tent,

205
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:26,231
you'll see the most
beautiful girls you ever saw.

206
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:30,101
Six of the loveliest in the
world, like my sister Mona here.

207
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,132
Give 'em a little show, girl.

208
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,106
Open it up... No, that's all.

209
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,540
Just a tease.

210
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,142
Who will dare to face
the challenge of the Fun House?

211
00:21:41,242 --> 00:21:43,745
Who is brave enough?

212
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,482
How about you, sir?

213
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,684
Who is man enough...

214
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:52,952
to enter that world of darkness?

215
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:57,087
Terrifying terror ride.

216
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:02,665
You will scream with terror.

217
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:06,970
You will beg for release.

218
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,338
But there will be no escape.

219
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,770
For there is no release...

220
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,413
from the Fun House.

221
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,548
So, what about it?

222
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:20,113
- Huh?
- [Mocking] Huh?

223
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,621
What do you wanna do?
It's your choice.

224
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,920
What? What?

225
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,755
How about the magician?
Wanna come?

226
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,855
Yeah. Good idea.

227
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:31,061
Hell, I love magicians.

228
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:34,411
I met an uncle once who was a magician.

229
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,234
I mean it.

230
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:38,334
Oh, he was bad.

231
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,204
One, please.

232
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:53,418
Have you seen two guys
and two girls on a double date?

233
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:56,578
Hey, kid,
I ain't the fortune teller.

234
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:01,692
Now, I need a volunteer from the audience.

235
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:05,028
A young lady,
preferably attractive.

236
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,763
Come on, now. Don't be bashful.

237
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:14,006
You.

238
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,106
You. Come on.

239
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:16,975
No, I couldn't.

240
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,977
Of course you could. Come on.

241
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:23,344
Come on. Let's give
our little lady a big hand.

242
00:23:27,853 --> 00:23:29,619
You're not afraid, are you?

243
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,590
Yes!

244
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,187
Smart girl.

245
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,594
Please step into the coffin.

246
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,895
Go ahead. Right inside.

247
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,764
I promise you'll feel no pain.

248
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:43,159
HECKLER: Get a regular job.

249
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,437
Comfy?

250
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:48,907
No.

251
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,007
Good.

252
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:53,136
Now a little history.

253
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,107
[Sharply] A little history.

254
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:02,550
In the fifth century,
Vlad V of Wallachia,

255
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,841
known as Vlad the lmpaler to his friends.

256
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,859
Tortured 23,000 prisoners
in a device not unlike this.

257
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:19,566
Tiring of his name,
he decided to change it.

258
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:24,706
He selected his father's name, Dracul,

259
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:26,806
meaning devil.

260
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,981
He added the letter A and became...

261
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,383
Dracula.

262
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:39,686
Literally, 'son of the devil'.

263
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,925
And so legends are born.

264
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,995
With that history in mind,

265
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,730
I present, without further ado,

266
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,867
The lmpaler.

267
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,466
Notice, if you will,

268
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:57,471
that a hole has been cut
in the front of this box,

269
00:24:57,571 --> 00:25:01,745
right over the human heart within.

270
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:06,114
I insert the stake gently.

271
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:08,218
Do you feel that?

272
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:10,987
- Yes.
- Good.

273
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:14,226
And now, without further ado, I present

274
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:16,326
The lmpaler.

275
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,733
[Screaming]

276
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:25,763
Oh, my God! Is there a doctor
in the house? Lights! Lights!

277
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:31,473
Ladies and gentlemen,

278
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,641
my charming daughter, Carmella.

279
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,514
[Applause]

280
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:41,629
Thank you for your patronage.
The next show is in two hours.

281
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,026
[Giggling]

282
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,126
Gimme a drag!

283
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,479
Hey! Went out.

284
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:15,082
Wait a sec. Let me get that.

285
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:18,288
You ready?

286
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,251
- See ya, Richie.
- Hey! Come on, man!

287
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:26,329
Hey, who wants to go on The Cobra?

288
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:28,496
LIZ: Ooh, I do.

289
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,596
AMY: Hey, me too.

290
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,640
Hey, you guys,
it isn't even finished yet.

291
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,950
LIZ: Hey, Richie! Come on!

292
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,709
Come on!

293
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,979
Hey, Buzz, look. Fortune teller.

294
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,164
[Muttering outside]...

295
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:19,114
[European accent] This is a very
serious business for Madam Zena.

296
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:24,059
Don't be concerned. The aspects
are wonderful for tonight.

297
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:36,991
[Other three giggle]...

298
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,164
[Richie makes spooky sounds]

299
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,493
A deep, mystic cross.

300
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:08,066
Good.

301
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,034
[Others snicker]

302
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:13,566
It means you were born...

303
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,301
with a knowledge of the occult.

304
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,750
Are you sensitive?

305
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,088
Do you have premonitions
that often come true?

306
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,789
- No.
- [Others snicker]

307
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:37,892
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

308
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:41,126
Please, I need to concentrate.

309
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:49,039
[Laughter]

310
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,499
Wait. Wait...

311
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,909
Three bracelets.

312
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,544
That is good.

313
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:58,949
That means a long life-line...

314
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:02,218
springing from the mouth of truth.

315
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:04,318
- [Others laugh]
- Shh!

316
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:08,760
Wait.

317
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,955
Quite a break in the faith line.

318
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,626
Hmm. It makes sense.

319
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:24,240
A tall, dark stranger will
enter and change your life.

320
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,710
[Laughter]

321
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,011
Larry Latiner, right?

322
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:29,610
Do not mock the stars.

323
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,082
[Hoots of laughter]

324
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:35,452
Hey, I thought she was reading her palm?

325
00:29:35,552 --> 00:29:38,485
Out! Out of here, you bad brats!

326
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:43,005
I have performed in front
of crowned heads of Europe!

327
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,465
Don't come back...

328
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:53,303
or I'll break every bone
in your fuckin' bodies.

329
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,403
Beat it!

330
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:11,255
Plain burger coming up.

331
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:13,355
What do you want?

332
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:19,930
You dropped something.

333
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,489
- I know.
- You know?

334
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,235
Hey, Buzz,

335
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:29,036
How come you never asked me out before?

336
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,136
I don't know.

337
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,008
I didn't think you'd go out with me.

338
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:37,515
Oh, I would.

339
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:39,615
I'm glad you did.

340
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:46,656
Who will dare to face
the challenge of the Fun House?

341
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:49,059
Who is brave enough?

342
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,794
Hey, come on, you guys.
It's getting late.

343
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:56,379
- Want some cotton candy?
- No, thank you.

344
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:05,905
Who is man enough to enter
that world of darkness.

345
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:08,005
Right. Here we go!

346
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:17,318
[Screeches and baby wailing]

347
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:33,170
Terrifying terror ride.

348
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:37,204
Goblins, ghosties and ghoulies.

349
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,739
18 of the worst mistakes...

350
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,079
that nature ever visited on man or beast.

351
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:46,413
They are all inside and alive.

352
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,718
My own lovely sister.

353
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,750
Right here.

354
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,975
Mona. The beautiful Mona.

355
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:55,292
She wiggles and she dances.

356
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,160
RICHIE: You ever been in one?

357
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,827
LIZ: No.

358
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:02,328
Oh, come on.
It's three bucks apiece.

359
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:04,532
LIZ: Besides, you have to be 21.

360
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,504
There she goes.
Turn around, darlin'.

361
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:07,803
Give 'em a look.

362
00:32:07,903 --> 00:32:11,473
Come on. They always
have holes back there.

363
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,509

"Darlin', you're the greatest.
What was your name again?"

580
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:26,850

He's harmless.

I don't hate the sound of your voice.

748
01:08:03,893 --> 01:08:05,893
When I was a kid,

749
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:08,960
I once tried to spook my older brother...

750
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,731
by hiding in his closet.

751
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:13,966
And while I was waiting in there,

752

to jump out and scare him,

753
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:19,629
a weird thought came into my head.

754
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:25,250
What if he knew I was in there...

755
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:28,448
and he was standing
outside the closet door,

756
01:08:28,548 --> 01:08:31,976
waiting to jump out and scare me?

757
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,990
So what happened?

758
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:39,406
He locked you in, didn't he?

759
01:08:39,595 --> 01:08:45,563
I was in there for three hours,
till my parents got me out.

760
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,504
I was too scared to touch the door knob.

761
