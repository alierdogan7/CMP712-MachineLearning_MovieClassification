00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,736
    ( man breathing heavily )

2
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,903
        ( door closes )

3
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,834
        I hate this place.

4
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:39,185
        ( door closes )

5
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:43,522
            ( gasps )

6
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:52,448
        ( screaming )

7
00:03:15,339 --> 00:03:18,207
        ( hoses retracting )

8
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:32,888
            Oh, water?

9
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:36,759
            Water.

10
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,260
            Water.

11
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:41,764
            Water.

12
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:50,340
            Huh?

13
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,932
        ( screaming )

14
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,140
            Unh! Uhh!

15
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:08,474
            Aaaaah!

16
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,283
            Aah! Aaah!

17
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:21,587
            Uhh! Aaah!

18
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:27,476
            Aah! Uhh!

19
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,429
            Aaaaaaaah!

20
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:40,823
    Man: Now that is sick.

21
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:44,327
        ( monitor beeping )

22
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,897
    Ohh! Are you watching this?

23
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:50,900
        Second man: No, thanks.
        I don't look anymore.

24
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,836
    ( machines whirring, beeping )

25
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:09,419
We've seen a lot,
but this is just...

26
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:12,355
Oh, dear god.

27
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,970
    Wow!

28
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:20,456
            You know, you
            shouldn't be looking

29
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,158
                at the files.

30
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,993
Well, it's not
against the rules.

31
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:25,995
                But it's not
                encouraged.

32
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:27,930
Come on, man.
We've all--

33
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:31,133
            It's not encouraged.

34
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:35,922
        Ok.

35
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:09,098
            Ok, screw this.

36
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,101
            Pawn to King 2.

37
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,336
Knight to Queen's
Bishop 6.

38
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,088
    Check.

39
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,757
                    What?

40
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,659
                I didn't even
                see that.

41
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,602
You know, I was--
I was just wondering...

42
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:33,706
Um... when is
Chickliss coming back?

43
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,791
            Sometime this week.

44
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,243
        Probably all suntanned,
        the prick.

45
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,132
                Let's see...

46
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:46,502
                King to King's
                Bishop 8.

47
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,871
Rook takes Queen.
Check.

48
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:51,056
                Damn it.

49
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:54,394
                    Damn.

50
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:55,745
    Sorry.

51
00:08:55,747 --> 00:08:58,280
            Shut up. I don't
            need your sympathy.

52
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,699
        ( pen rattles )

53
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,518
And Owen?

54
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:09,358
Where's Owen?

55
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,660
        Are you trying to
        psyche me out or what?

56
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:14,096
           I can-- I can't hear
            myself think.

57
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,168
                Owen is...

58
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,670
            Owen is probably
            out sick again.

59
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,823
            That would be
            my best guess.

60
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,227
Are you sure?

61
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,112
                Yes.

62
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:38,403
                Yes.

63
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,673
            Despite your rather
            transparent tactics,

64
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:43,242
            Brainman,
            prepare to die.

65
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:46,195
            Bishop to Queen's
            Knight 7.

66
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,563
                 <i>Checkski.</i>

67
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:48,981
Queen takes Bishop.

68
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,951
I believe that's
 <i>checkski mateski.</i>

69
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:54,103
                What? No way.

70
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:57,272
                Aw, come on.
                How did you--

71
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,375
                You freak
                of nature!

72
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:02,778
    ( garbled radio transmission )

73
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:13,873
You know, the other night,
I heard some noise.

74
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,741
                Noise?

75
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,393
    Yeah.

76
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:18,978
In Owen's room,
like a...

77
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,713
Like a scuffle.

78
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,214
                    Really?

79
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:25,217
Yeah. You don't
think that--

80
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,719
                You dreamt it.

81
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,220
No, look--

82
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,222
            You dreamt it.

83
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:33,158
        You always complain
        about your nightmares.

84
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:38,898
    ( hollow whistling, creaking )

85
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,902
They come
for you at night.

86
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,270
                    What?

87
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,756
They come for you
at night.

88
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:48,274
                    Who does?

89
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,858
They do.

90
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,594
                    Drop it.

91
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,095
They do.

92
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:54,430
                    Enough!

93
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,198
                What are you,
                suicidal?

94
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200

97
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:23,776
                Ah, good.

98
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:26,145
            They didn't forget
            lunch this time.

99
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,785
Goat-cheese Salad
with Ginseng,

100
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,805
Liver Fricassee,
and Mango Sorbet.

101
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:39,024
    Ew...

102
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:41,393
Must be you.

103
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:48,233
Steak Frites.
That's me.

104
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:49,301
                        Hey.

105
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:50,469
    What?

106
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:51,904
Oh. Sorry.

107
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:55,641
        Bless us, our lord,
        for these, thy gifts,

108
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,310
        which we are about to
        receive from thy bounty.

            Through you,
            our lord, amen.

110
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:01,647
    Amen.

111

116
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:29,858
Ok. Zooming out

00:12:57,954 --> 00:12:59,888
        Keep your tongue in
        your mouth, Brainman.

            We're on the clock.
            Are we locked?

127
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:07,129
Sorry. Locked on.

00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:43,485
    And there you have it.

155
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:47,372
                You do this
                long enough,

156
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:49,809
                you could do it
                in your sleep.

157
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:52,845
                Ha ha ha.
               In  your  sleep.

158
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:55,063
                Recording dreams
                in your sleep.

159
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,565
                That's funny.

160
00:15:56,567 --> 00:16:00,569
When's the last time
you remember being outside?

161
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:02,487
                Uh... last night.
                I had a dream

162
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:04,556
                about being
                at the beach.

163
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,558
No, no. I mean
really outside,

164
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,193
not a dream.

165
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,566
I don't remember.

166
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,734
I've been busy
lately.

167
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:20,438
Overloaded actually,
picking up slack...

168
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,075
                    for you,
                    I might add.

169
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:25,510
I don't remember,
either.

170
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,930
Isn't that weird?

171
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,366
                You're weird.

172
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,885
Shut up and let me
concentrate.

173
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,086
            ( clang )

174
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:35,587
    Damn it.

175
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,556
                You know, I was
                just thinking--

176
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:39,741
        Stop thinking.

177
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,044
    What's gotten into you?

178
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:45,064
                What's gotten
                into me?

179
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:50,102
You know
who these are?

180
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:53,105
            Chickliss' kids--
            Arthur and Sunshine.

181
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:56,041
Orphans.
They're orphans.

182
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:06,118
You told me Chickliss
was on vacation.

183
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,620
                I have to go
                to the can.

184
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:09,788
            ( beep )

185
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,624
                Try not to drool
                on the controls.

186
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:14,727
                Screws up
                the calibration.

187
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,382
    ( click )

188
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:21,583

00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,357
            ( beep )

190
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,615
        ( moans softly )

191
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:41,997
        Bastards.

192
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,169
        Where is she?

193
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,842
    What have you done
        with her?

194
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:58,680
        Where's...

195
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,684
    Girl's voice: Mom!

196
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:11,192
        What have you
        done to me?

197
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,863
    Why can't I remember?

198
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:19,034
    Why can't I remember
    my daughter's name?

199
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:54,570
            Hey.

200
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:11,236
                Let me go!

201
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:12,420
                Get off me!

202
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:15,323
Ok, ok. Sorry.

203
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:18,527
    It's ok.

204
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:19,944
    She's one of us.

205
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:23,215
            Touch me again,
            soldier,

206
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,316
            and you'll be eating
            your eyeballs.

207
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,252
Why "soldier"?
What do you know about me?

208
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:29,037
            Tattoo on
            your forehead.

209
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,655
        You're in the squads,
        right, Killer?

210
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:33,926
        You show up by night,
        and people disappear.

211
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:34,893
            ( spits )

212
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,849
    Why did you
    do that?

213
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:42,351
                Because
                you're scum.

214
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:44,353
Look, miss...

215
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:46,355
you have us
at a disadvantage here.

216
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,357
None of us remembers
how we got here...

217
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,359
or pretty much
anything else.

218
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:51,860
    Including who we are.

219
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:54,863
    So whatever you think
    you know about me...

220
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,865
    I don't even
    know myself.

221
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,867
            I don't trust her.

222
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:01,070
            She knows something.

223
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,288
Thank god
somebody does.

224
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,861
                Have you seen
                any children?

225
00:21:09,863 --> 00:21:12,364
                A little girl?

226
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:13,865
    No.

227
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:17,402
My god. I hope they
don't put kids in here.

228
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:18,786
    That would be
    horrible.

229
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:19,887
        Why do you think

230
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:21,389
        there would be
        children in here?

231
00:21:21,391 --> 00:21:23,391
                    I've got to
                    keep moving.

232
00:21:23,393 --> 00:21:25,960
    Wait. You've
    got to be careful

233
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:27,279
    climbing around here.

234
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,513
                Why?

235
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:29,914
There are traps.

236
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,401
                Traps?

237
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:34,887
            How do you know?

238
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:37,155
        Because of this.

239
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,421
            That's
            a good bandage.

240
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:55,624
            You a doctor?

241
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,092
                I don't know.

242
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:58,927
        I did it.
        I might be

243
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,929
    friggin' Mother Teresa
        for all I know,

244
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,363
    but I don't remember.

245
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,633
You remember
something...

246
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:07,685
                before
                all of this.

247
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:11,289
                Not much.

248
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,259
            Being chased
            through the woods

249
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:19,148
            by guys like you.

250
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,483
            Tattoo set me off.

251
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,951
When I first
woke up,

252
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,953
I don't think I would've
known my own name

253
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:27,456
if it wasn't
stitched on my shirt.

254
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,591
    I don't even know
    if this is my name.

255
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:33,962
I feel like we've
been here for hours,

256
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:35,931
and I still can't
remember anything!

257
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:42,904
Hey, hey, hey.
Give her a moment.

258
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:47,976
            Fine. A moment.

259
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,978
            But we've got to
            get moving

260
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,546
            while we still
            have our strength.

261
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,481
                    You guys
                    have a plan?

262
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:55,483
        We keep moving
        in the same direction

263
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,652
        till we find the edge.

264
00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:00,972
        This place has
        got to end eventually.

265
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:03,008
                Well, what about
                the traps?

266
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,795
We test the rooms.
We have a system.

267
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,944
            Safe.

268
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:29,784
        I'm going in.

269
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:49,471
            Huh?

270
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:15,480
            Help.

271
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:18,583
            Help!

272
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,320
            ( gasps )

273
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:40,021
    What kind of animals
        would do this?

274
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:01,542
Does she look
familiar to you?

275
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:08,082
I keep thinking
I've seen her before.

276
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,454
Wonder what
she's in for?

277
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:14,839
                You're making
                a mistake.

278
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,108
    Huh?

279
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,875
                What's
                the first rule

280
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,311
                I taught you
                about this job?

281
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:22,196
Uh... neatness counts.

282
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,299
                Very funny.

283
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:26,702
            Don't get involved.

284
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:29,621
I know. I'm not
getting involved, ok?

285
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:31,673
I'm drawing.

286
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:34,125
You have your chess.
Owen has his fish.

287
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,626
Chickliss has his--

288
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:37,295
            Could we spend
            5 minutes

289
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,130
            without bringing up
            Owen and Chickliss,

290
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:40,131
            Please?

291
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,149
            And get us back
            on real time.

292
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,586
            Gonna get us
            in trouble.

293
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,255
    ( beep )

294
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:59,618
I'll show you 3 ways
to beat that game,

295
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,770
but if you answer
one question.

296
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:09,093
                Fine. What?

297
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:10,578
Ok. See, what
I want to know is--

298
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,398
                Hold it.
                Show me.

299
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,217
    Ok.

300
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:21,122
    Whew.

301
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:50,168
Checkmate.

302
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,703
You win.

303
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:58,226
            That's brilliant.
            Do that again.

304
00:26:58,228 --> 00:27:01,245
What do you know
about a third exit?

305
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:02,397
                    What?

306
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:04,232
A third exit,
an auxiliary exit

307
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:06,401
that leads
directly outside.

308
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:07,736
                There's
                no such thing.

309
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,070
Owen said there was.

310
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:10,739
He said Chickliss
found some old plans--

311
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:12,240
                They were
                having you on.

312
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:13,742
No way. Actually...

313
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,410
I think that's
why they're gone.

314
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:17,245
I think they found
something out and--

315
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,747
            I think you better
            stop listening

316
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:19,748
            to old wives' tales.

317
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,749
Just listen to me.

318
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:22,250
            This conversation
            is over.

319
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:23,785
Don't you
ever worry?

320
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:25,253
                About what?

321
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:28,123
One day, you're
gonna wake up inside.

322
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,242
            The only way I'm
            gonna wake up inside

323
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:32,244
            is if I keep on
            talking to you.

324
00:27:32,246 --> 00:27:33,678
    No--

325
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:38,266
These things
are useless!

326
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:41,269
    The sensors in that room
    must have been different.

327
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:43,271
        Maybe they're not
        motion sensors.

328
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:45,774
    Maybe they're triggered
        by heat or sound

329
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:46,941
        or something.

330
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,442
Why don't you
just admit it?

331
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:49,443
We're dead!

332
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,946
    He can't admit it.
    It's the training.

333
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:55,116
    The Army never
    admits defeat.

334
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,951
            You got a problem
            with me, lady?

335
00:27:56,953 --> 00:27:58,286
    Yeah.

336
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,321
                    Why?

337
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:01,406
I don't trust you.

338
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,276
        Man: Aw, how the hell
        did we miss this?

339
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,378
What is it?

340
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,780
                "C.I.A."

341
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:10,982
                What is that?

342
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:14,368
            A clue as to who
            built this place?

343
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,320
I think that's
just a coincidence.

344
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:18,273
Try the other doors.

345
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,443
            "Y.Y.O."

346
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,512
            "U.D.S."

347
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:29,634
            "S.A.N."
        What do they mean?

348
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,302
I really think
it's a mistake

349
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:33,705
to think of these letters
as meaning something.

350
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:36,324
It's like some kind
of code or puzzle

351
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:37,491
we have to
figure out.

352
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:40,712
        A puzzle?
    They're playing with us.

353
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:43,064
                We should make
                a map.

354
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,883
        Using what?
        Our blood?

355
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,085
I don't know, maybe.
You got a better idea?

356
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:50,321
    I have a better idea.

357
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:54,258
        I need something.
            I need...

358
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:57,778
            You have a hairpin.

359
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,490
        They did us the favor
        of polishing our boots.

360
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:15,379
            Ok. We'll flag
            the safe rooms.

361
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:18,166
                "C.I.A."

362
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:19,667
                Give me
                the others.

363
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,469
        "Y.Y.O., U.D.S.,"

364
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:23,838
        and "S.A.N."

365
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,974
                Good memory.

366
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:27,492
    Yeah, in the short term.

367
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:29,060
    Now I wish I could remember
        what happened to me

368
00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:30,462
        between birth
    and about 3 hours ago.

369
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:32,464
                Ha ha. Right.

370
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:34,481
I don't know.

371
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:38,653
Shoe polish
and a hairpin.

372
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:43,541
Nothing in this place
is random.

373
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:46,428
        Maybe the bastards
        just underestimated us.

374
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:08,966
        So near and yet so far.

375
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:11,069
Yeah, but she's doing
better than most.

376
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,237
I mean, half of them

377
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,905
don't even notice
the letters,

378
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:16,574
let alone map them.

379
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,410
        I meant the chess.

380
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:28,653
        Give it up.
    She doesn't stand a chance.

381
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:30,922
Of course
she has a chance.

382
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:31,923
            Ha ha. Yeah?

383
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,607
            You gonna ride in
            on your white horse

384
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,877
            and whisk her out?

385
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:39,930
The rooms could realign
to zero position.

386
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:41,432
                        Ha.

387
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:42,600
No, it happens.

388
00:30:42,602 --> 00:30:44,769
And then she'll
figure out the letters

389
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:45,770
and sail through.

390
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:46,937
                And what's
                the first thing

391
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:48,606
                the program does
                when the rooms

392
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:51,359
                realign to
                zero position?

393
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:52,510
A clean sweep.

394
00:30:52,512 --> 00:30:54,079
                Exactly.

395
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:54,963
                Poof.

396
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:55,964
            The only thing

397
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,298
            that's gonna sail
            through that

398
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,667
            is her ashes.

399
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:01,986
            Ha ha. Hey.

400
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:02,620
            Cheer up, buddy.

401
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:03,955
            They'll catch you
            another one.

402
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:05,306
            The boys upstairs

403
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,642
            like them young
            and pretty.

404
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:13,014
Don't you
ever feel guilty?

405
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:15,566
Don't you ever feel?

406
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:17,985
                Son, you're
                out of line.

407
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:20,004
Yeah, whatever.

408
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,472
                Excuse me?

409
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:23,307
            Why don't you
            stop your doodling

410
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:24,976
            and do some work
            for a change?

411
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:28,012
    Like what?

412
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:31,316
We're waiting for orders.
It's what we do best.

413
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,051
It's what we do.

414
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:35,670
            Clean up your space.
            It's disgraceful.

415
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:40,074
You're kidding,
right?

416
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:42,943
            Do I look like
            I'm kidding?

417
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:54,288
    This one's "S.D.F."

418
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:58,142
Wait. Wait a minute.

419
00:31:58,144 --> 00:31:59,177
                    What?

420
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:01,512
I don't know if this
makes any difference,

421
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:04,465
but they're not periods.
They're commas.

422
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:14,325
He's right.
They're commas.

423
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,794
                Ok, so they're
                commas.

424
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:20,164
What difference
does it make?

425
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:23,817
We don't even know
what the letters mean yet.

426
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,552
            I mean, if they
            were numbers,

427
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:27,054
            I'd understand
            the commas.

428
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:29,456
Haskell: Understand
the commas how?

429
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,541
                Well, isn't that
                how you plot

430
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:31,843
                coordinates
                on a graph--

431
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:33,144
             X coordinate comma
             y coordinate comma

432
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:34,712
                z coordinate?

433
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:37,682
    Right. So if the rooms
    were labeled with numbers,

434
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:39,700
        like 10, 1, 7...

435
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:40,969
        you would know
        something

436
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,103
        about the room's
        position.

437
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,088
    Yeah, but we've
    got letters

438
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,557
    that so far tell us
    absolutely nothing.

439
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,843
            That is where you're
            wrong, soldier.

440
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:50,561
            The letters tell us
            one important fact

441
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,897
            that numbers
            never would.

442
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:54,064
                    What fact?

443
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:57,902
Oh. There are only 26 letters
    in the english alphabet.

444
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,187
    So?

445
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:04,075
        So we know
        the parameters.

446
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:06,160
            Exactly.

447
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:07,161
            If each room

448
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:09,630
            has its own unique
            letter combination,

449
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,049
            then it's
            a pretty good bet

450
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,601
            that this whole
            place is a cube

451
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:15,786
            with 26 rooms
            on each side.

452
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:17,588
        Worst-case scenario--
            we're anywhere

453
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,692
        from one to 25 rooms
        away from the edge.

454
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,660
            Let's go.

455
00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:24,012
Great. Actually,

456
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:26,030
it's your turn
to go first.

457
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:31,619
        "S, O, S."

458
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:34,756
        No kidding.

459
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:52,739
        Uh... I guess
    we'll try another way.

460
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,316
        ( indistinct voices
            on radio )

461
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:08,639
( muttering )
Rains,  Rains,  Rains,

462
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:12,476
Rains, Rains, Rains,
Rains, Rains, Rains.

463
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:37,351
                Cassandra.

464
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,691
            The little girl's
            name is Anna.

465
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:47,728
Protests and strikes.
Troublemakers up north.

466
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,698
The whole country's
going to crap.

467
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,167
Ungrateful pigs.

468
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:58,189
    Oh, my god.
    Oh, my god.

469
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,690
                What is it now?

470
00:34:59,692 --> 00:35:01,692
                Please tell me
                that's not a--

471
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:03,127
                Would you
                put that away?

472
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,695
There's
no consent form.

473
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:05,863
                    What?

474
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:09,200
There's no pink page.
The consent form's missing!

475
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:10,701
                    So?

476
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:12,703
So? You know the rules.

477
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:14,538
She can't be in there
without a consent form.

478
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,040
            You think
            they're gonna stop

479
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,041
            this whole operation

480
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:18,709
            because you lost
            a piece of paper?

481
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,211
I didn't lose it!

482
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:22,213
Look, you know
how anal these guys are.

483
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:23,714
Maybe she'll get
another hearing.

484
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:25,516
            Listen to yourself.

485
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,235
No, but this could be
huge-- a mistrial.

486
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:29,237
            Oh, sure.
            Anything you say.

487
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,738
    Look--

488
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,240
                Hey!

489
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:36,160
See? I told you
I recognized her.

490
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,801
                Hmm. She's
                a political.

491
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:46,070
                So that would
                explain it.

492
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:48,172
What do you mean?

493
00:35:50,242 --> 00:35:52,243
                I mean...

494
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,246
            there might not be
            a consent form.

495
00:35:55,248 --> 00:35:56,747
                Get it?

496
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,268
But that's illegal.

497
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,770
            You know,
            for a child prodigy,

498
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:04,705
                you ain't
                too bright.

499
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:08,108
We've got to
do something.

500
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,543
                    Like what?

501
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,279
We've got to let them
know upstairs.

502
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,314
                And how are we
                gonna do that?

503
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:16,250
Call up.

504
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:20,671
                It's just
                for emergencies.

505
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:22,773
Well, what do you
think this is?

506
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:24,775
                I don't see
                a fire.

507
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:26,777
    I don't see a gas leak
        or flooding.

508
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,779
I don't see you
writhing on the floor

509
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,814
in the throes
of a heart attack,

510
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,283
but, god knows,
right now I'd like to!

511
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:33,617
            She's gonna die
            in there,

512
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,952
            and she's
            probably innocent!

513
00:36:34,954 --> 00:36:36,454
Hey, none of them
are innocent.

514
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:37,621
You read the files.

515
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:39,457
You know what kind of
people end up in there.

516
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:40,958
            Exactly! All we know

517
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,894
            is what we read
            in the... files.

518
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:46,797
            Oh, my god.

519
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,466
            What if it's
            all bogus?

520
00:36:48,468 --> 00:36:50,134
        The files, the crimes,
        everything.

521
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:51,635
            Maybe they're
            just putting

522
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:54,605
            anyone in there
            they don't like.

523
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:56,323
There's a purpose,
and there's a plan.

524
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,659
And I'm not so stupid
as to think there's no plan

525
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,828
just because
I don't understand it!

526
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,263
Here's a news flash.
We're just the button men.

527
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,332
If we were meant
to be analysts,

528
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,834
we'd be working
upstairs.

529
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:08,836
        Would you forget
        the party line for once

530
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:10,604
            and make the call?

531
00:37:13,341 --> 00:37:14,842
    Ok.

532
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:17,011
        ( keys rattling )

533
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:20,848
You do it.
You're the hero.

534
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:27,171
                Just remember--

535
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,672
                she was
                in the news,

536
00:37:28,674 --> 00:37:30,641
                and they made
                her disappear.

537
00:37:30,643 --> 00:37:31,859
                How much easier
                would it be

538
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:33,127
                to get to you?

539
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:37,431
                No one even
                knows you exist.

540
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:39,683
                Who knows where

541
00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:41,285
                you'll wake up
                tomorrow?

542
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,809
            ( ring )
<i> </i>

543
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:53,648
            ( ring )

544
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:58,318
    Hello.

545
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:04,158
It's for you.

546
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:11,165
                    Yeah?

547
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,402
                    Sir.

548
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:15,903
                Yes, sir.

549
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,405
            Right away, sir.

550
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,440
                Yes, sir.
<i> </i>

551
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,842
            I understand, sir.
            Yes, sir.

552
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:26,346
        ( hangs up telephone )

553
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:30,418
            We got work to do.

554
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,920
            Someone's
            at the exit.

555
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:34,455
Our exit?

556
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,440
Uh, what do
we do?

557
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:38,425
            The exit procedure.

558
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:39,794
Whoa. Wait a minute.

559
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,429
I've never done
this before.

560
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:43,196
Don't you usually
do this with Owen?

561
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:44,765
            That's right,
            my friend.

562
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,934
            But Owen's
            not here, is he?

563
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:49,937
            And the rules
            clearly state

564
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,939
            that 2 senior
            technicians

565
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,941
            have to be present

566
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:57,094
            at all exit
            procedures.

567
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:59,564
Right, but I am not
a senior technician.

568
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:00,948
        Hey, I need help here.

569
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,883
        That was a phone call
        from upstairs--

570
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,685
        Personal contact, direct
        orders from above.

571
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,437
        They never do that.

572
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:09,207
        We can't screw this up.

573
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:14,679
    Uh... we?

574
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:17,215
                    Yes, we.

575
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:19,967
        ( machine whirring )

576
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:22,970
As far as I
understand... sir,

577
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:25,806
only senior techs
are allowed

578
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:27,808
to perform
the exit procedure.

579
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,977
Perhaps it would be
in my best interest

580
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:32,880
to abstain until receiving
clearance from...

581
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:34,749
higher up.

582
00:39:38,136 --> 00:39:41,438
            You little prick.

583
00:39:42,975 --> 00:39:44,141
                    Ok.

584
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,477
                Ok, I get it.

585
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:48,980
                Look, you help
                me with this,

586
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:52,182
            I'll tell them about
            your girlfriend. Ok?

587
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,184
    When?

588
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,119
                    What?

589
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:58,088
When will you
let them know?

590
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,492
            As soon as we're
            done with this.

591
00:40:01,494 --> 00:40:03,744
                All right?

592
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:05,095

Just follow my lead.

He's gone. It's over.

662
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:13,804
He was one of us.

663
00:45:13,806 --> 00:45:17,241
            No. Once inside,
            he's one of them.

664
00:45:26,317 --> 00:45:29,269
So this is your big
exit procedure?

we doing here?

00:45:43,151 --> 00:45:45,786
                and push
                the buttons, ok?

670
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,913
What happens
if you push yes?

671
00:45:55,915 --> 00:45:57,848
                I don't know.

672
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,300
                No one's ever
                said yes.

673
00:46:07,058 --> 00:46:09,276
                    Here.

674

00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,909
  - You sure?
                  - Yes.

          What are you doing?

685
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:58,418
            You're not
            allowed in there.

697
00:50:59,817 --> 00:51:03,086
            I believe these
            belong to you.

698
00:51:05,156 --> 00:51:07,157
            Well, it looks
            as though

699
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:09,159
            you've got yourself
            a little bit

700
00:51:09,161 --> 00:51:11,161
            of a situation
            down here.

701
00:51:11,163 --> 00:51:12,595
                May we?

702
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:18,168
    The boys upstairs felt
you could perhaps use a hand,

703
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:21,171
        and so here we are.

704
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:23,173
        My name is Jax,
        and these are

705
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:25,575
        my associates
    Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley.

706
00:51:25,577 --> 00:51:26,977
            Right.

707
00:51:26,979 --> 00:51:29,846
            Gentlemen,
        first things first.

708
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:31,682
        We locate our mouse.
        He has no implant,

709
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:33,684
        and so we shall
        have to do this

710
00:51:33,686 --> 00:51:35,686
    the old-fashioned way,
        I'm afraid.

711
00:51:35,688 --> 00:51:37,688
Mr. Quigley, run a visual check
        on all rooms.

712
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,189
    He couldn't have gone far.

713
00:51:39,191 --> 00:51:40,691
                    Yes, sir.

714
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:42,693
    Thank you. Mr. Finn,
    run a probability tree

715
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:44,194
        on his potential
        movements.

716
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:46,430
        Let's have some
    contingencies, shall we?

717
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:48,131
Right away, sir.

718
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:29,756
    Excuse me,
    Mr. Jax, sir.

719
00:52:29,758 --> 00:52:32,576
    Uh, excuse me, sir.

720
00:52:35,746 --> 00:52:38,281
                Yes, Mr. Cod?

721
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:40,750
Uh... it's Dodd, sir.

722
00:52:40,752 --> 00:52:42,252
                        Oh.

723
00:52:42,254 --> 00:52:44,153
What...
What do I do?

724
00:52:45,923 --> 00:52:47,424
            I'm sorry? You?

725
00:52:47,426 --> 00:52:49,259
            Yes.
            I almost forgot.

726
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:52,262
            I have your orders
            from upstairs.

727
00:52:52,264 --> 00:52:54,831
            It's a personal
            delivery. Ha ha.

728
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,533
    Ha.

729
00:52:58,102 --> 00:53:00,770
        "Order number 793..."
        blah blah blah blah.

        series of needle tests

732

            You do know
            what that means?

733
00:53:12,284 --> 00:53:14,317
Yes, sir.

734
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,535
Of course, sir.

Right away, sir.

00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:22,642

            for our little
            mouse hunt.

740
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:27,314
Of course, sir.

741
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:28,982
Anything I can do
to help, sir.

742
00:53:28,984 --> 00:53:30,150
            That's the spirit,
            Mr. Mod.

743
00:53:30,152 --> 00:53:32,052
        Way to keep the world
        safe for democracy.

744
00:53:32,054 --> 00:53:33,320
            Have we got
            a visual yet?

745
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:34,587
    Quigley: Still working
        on it, sir.

746
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:45,315
        Ok. "K, G, K."
        that's 3 odds.

747
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:48,818
        "M, A, Q."
        also 3 odds.

748
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,320
            Safe.

749
00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:52,922
    Like taking candy
        from a baby.

750
00:53:57,344 --> 00:53:58,844
        "A, Z, Z."
<i> </i>

751
00:53:58,846 --> 00:54:00,846
        "A, Z, Z."

752
00:54:00,848 --> 00:54:02,782
        Rains: Got it.

753
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:13,793
Oh. I don't know why we bother
with these things anymore.

754
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,862
            "A, Z, Z."

755
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:18,865
    Hmm. That's the first time
        I've seen a "Z."

756
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:20,867
            Do you think
            it means anything?

757
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:22,369
I don't know.

758
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:24,371
                Ah, don't
                let the door--

759
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:25,872
        ( door closes )

760
00:54:25,874 --> 00:54:27,807
                Damn it!

761
00:54:40,554 --> 00:54:42,555
        She's gone.

762
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:52,498
            ( thud )

763
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:55,835
            ( exhales nervously )

764
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,327
( typing )

765
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:07,863
        Ok. Subject
        is isolated.

766
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:29,603
        Now the tricky part.

767
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:34,090
        ( whirring )

768
00:55:45,436 --> 00:55:46,703
                ( sighs )

769
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:48,872
                ( sighs )

770
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:57,681
            Unh!
<i> </i>

771
00:55:57,683 --> 00:55:59,049
            Uhh!

772
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:06,238
                Unh! Uhh!

773
00:56:12,313 --> 00:56:16,582
                Uhh uhh uhh.

774
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,483
        Ok. They were
        last seen here...

775
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:36,502
    less than an hour ago.

776
00:56:36,504 --> 00:56:39,922
    So she should still be
    in the same quadrant.

777
00:57:03,564 --> 00:57:07,533
        The rooms move.
    I mean, they have to.

778
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:09,535
    She can't be that far.

779
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:11,705
            Yeah, but if we veer
            too far off course

780
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:12,706
            looking for her,

781
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,207
            we'll never
            find the edge.

782
00:57:14,209 --> 00:57:16,042
        Ok. Well, what do you
        suggest, killer?

783
00:57:16,044 --> 00:57:17,543
        We cut our losses?

784
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:19,312
Uh... guys.

785
00:57:21,082 --> 00:57:23,666
Are we sure
this room is safe?

786
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,542
            Maybe he just
            starved to death.

787
00:57:32,544 --> 00:57:35,478
            God, I'm hungry.

788
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,051
( removing boots )

789
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:42,552
            What are you doing?

790
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,054
We could use these.

791
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:46,056
                We have to
                keep moving.

792
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:47,724
We have to get
back on track.

793
00:57:47,726 --> 00:57:49,559
We've already
chased our tails

794
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:51,561
for an hour
looking for her.

795
00:57:51,563 --> 00:57:53,563
God, this headache
is not going away.

796
00:57:53,565 --> 00:57:56,566
            Maybe it's the chip
            in your head.

797
00:57:56,568 --> 00:57:58,068
    What?

798
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,070
            Well, it's true,
            isn't it?

799
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:02,238
            I mean, they now put
            bio-receivers

800
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,239
        in all you army boys.

801
00:58:03,241 --> 00:58:04,674
        Keeps you on a leash.

802
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:06,075
        ( door opens )

803
00:58:06,077 --> 00:58:09,378
Lady, you've got a hell
of an imagination.

804
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,282
        Jackpot. It's her.

805
00:58:13,284 --> 00:58:15,084
                        Hmm.

806
00:58:15,086 --> 00:58:16,886
Damn it.

807
00:58:16,888 --> 00:58:19,089
    Is she all right?

808
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,092
                    Uh... she's
                    not moving.

809
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:23,526
    Great.

810
00:58:27,598 --> 00:58:30,233
            Hey.

811
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:33,752
        Hey, wake up.

812
00:58:35,622 --> 00:58:38,625
    Are you all right?

813
00:58:38,627 --> 00:58:41,644
        Rise and shine.

814
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:43,680
Is she...

815
00:58:46,283 --> 00:58:48,134
            There's a pulse.

816
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:50,369
            She's burning up.

817
00:58:50,371 --> 00:58:54,874
            Can you hear me?

818
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:56,625
Oh, my god.

819
00:58:56,627 --> 00:58:58,594
                What happened
                to you?

820
00:58:58,596 --> 00:59:00,480
        I don't...

821
00:59:00,482 --> 00:59:02,415
        feel so good.

822
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,135
            ( coughs )

823
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:07,637
        I need a doctor.

824
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:09,772
    Don't let her
    touch you!

825
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:12,475
                Aah! Oh, my god!

826
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:14,176
        Don't leave me.

827
00:59:14,178 --> 00:59:15,729
                Let go!

828
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,671
You...

829
00:59:25,673 --> 00:59:27,657
You just...

830
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:30,159
                I... I didn't
                mean to.

831
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:33,696
                She scratched,
                and I just...

832
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:37,750
    Haskell: You put her
    out of her misery.

833
00:59:37,752 --> 00:59:40,620
    My headache's gone.

834
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:47,193
Something was
eating away at her--

835
00:59:47,195 --> 00:59:50,196
A chemical
or a virus.

836
00:59:50,198 --> 00:59:53,600
            We never checked
            this room for traps.

837
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:56,202
                It could be
                in the air.

838
00:59:56,204 --> 00:59:58,637
Let's see your arm.

839
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:00,957
                We've got to get
                out of here.

840
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:02,775
    Show me your arm.

841
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:04,060
        He's right. We've got
        to get out of here.

842
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,862
        Your arm,
    where she scratched you.

843
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:06,863
                Let's see it.

844
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:07,864
- Why? You think--
                - Yes, I think.

845
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:11,150
Fine! There!
See? Nothing!

846
01:00:11,152 --> 01:00:12,669
A flesh wound.

847
01:00:14,538 --> 01:00:16,622
    Aah!

848
01:00:22,046 --> 01:00:23,947
                    Sure.

849
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:26,048
                    Nothing.

850
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,901
                What do we do
                with him?

851
01:00:28,903 --> 01:00:30,670
    What do you mean?

852
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,388
            I think whatever was
            eating away at her

853
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,722
            is spreading to him.

854
01:00:33,724 --> 01:00:35,474
Hey. Hello.
I'm still here.

855
01:00:35,476 --> 01:00:36,993
                Not for long.

856
01:00:36,995 --> 01:00:38,845
                I say
                we ditch him.

857
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,013
Screw you!

858
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:43,633
    Ok, just relax, guys.
    Nobody's ditching anyone.

859
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:45,568
                Look at him.

860
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,505
        Oh, my god.

861
01:00:48,507 --> 01:00:50,289
    What?

862
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:51,925
            It's your face.

863
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:00,500
    Crap.

864
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,654
    ( gulp )

865
01:01:07,908 --> 01:01:11,160
Please
don't leave me.

866
01:01:11,162 --> 01:01:13,796
        This is horrible.

867
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:15,114
            You want to
            baby-sit a dead man,

868
01:01:15,116 --> 01:01:16,532
            be my guest.

869
01:01:16,534 --> 01:01:19,435
Please.
I'll do anything.

870
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:22,555
                Anything?

871
01:01:22,557 --> 01:01:25,208
                From now on,

872
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:27,293
                you test
                the rooms...

873
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:28,928
                all of them.

874
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:34,717
    Fine.

875
01:01:43,209 --> 01:01:46,411
Oh. Well, we're not
going down there.

876
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:51,717
No sense wasting
a good boot. Ok.

877
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:53,152
            Get off him!

878
01:01:53,154 --> 01:01:54,687
        Aah!

879
01:01:54,689 --> 01:01:55,738
            ( thud )

880
01:01:58,675 --> 01:02:00,542
        Ohh!

881
01:02:01,828 --> 01:02:04,413
    Unh! Uhh!

882
01:02:05,816 --> 01:02:07,317
    Help me.

883
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:10,987
He's still alive
down there.

884
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:13,673
                Forget it.
                He's gone.

885
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:18,343
You heartless
son of a bitch!

886
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:25,067
            Ohh. Oh.

887
01:02:32,108 --> 01:02:34,611
            ( screaming )

888
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:55,815
                    No!

889
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:02,889
            Don't come near me.

890
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,390
I was protecting us.

891
01:03:04,392 --> 01:03:06,058
            You murdered him.

892
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,894
He was infected.

893
01:03:07,896 --> 01:03:09,896
You saw it.
It was spreading.

894
01:03:09,898 --> 01:03:11,898
We'd be dead
by now.

895
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,566
            You don't know that.

896
01:03:13,568 --> 01:03:16,001
    Wynn: Uh, actually,
        he's right.

897
01:03:16,003 --> 01:03:18,871
It's a highly contagious form
of necrotizing fasciitis--

898
01:03:18,873 --> 01:03:21,306
    A flesh-eating disease.

899
01:03:21,308 --> 01:03:23,125
Who the hell
are you?

900
01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:25,778
            I...

901
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,181
    I've come to help you.

902
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:30,399
                    Damn.

903
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:31,901
Problem, Mr. Scrod?

904
01:03:31,903 --> 01:03:33,402
                No problem, sir.

905
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:35,404
Anything
of interest?

906
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:37,907
            Well, actually, sir,
            I was about to--

907
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:41,443
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?

908
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:42,911
                Yes, sir.

909
01:03:42,913 --> 01:03:45,414
            As I was running
            my test series,

910
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,416
            as instructed, sir,

911
01:03:47,418 --> 01:03:48,417
            the quarry

912
01:03:48,419 --> 01:03:49,918
            intersected with
            my subjects, sir.

913
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,920
Good work, Rod.

914
01:03:51,922 --> 01:03:53,922
Who says
they only hire

915
01:03:53,924 --> 01:03:57,926
the mentally challenged
down here? Open.

916
01:03:57,928 --> 01:03:59,428
                Thank you, sir.

917
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,864
Up on the main monitor
now, please.

918
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,432
        Wynn: We collect--

919
01:04:03,434 --> 01:04:06,602
    I mean, <i>they</i> collect data
        and run tests,

920
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:08,771
        all kinds of tests--

921
01:04:08,773 --> 01:04:10,523
        Testing chemical
    and biological agents,

922
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:12,492
measuring brain activity,
        endurance.

923
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:14,460
        Most of it
    I don't understand.

924
01:04:14,462 --> 01:04:17,830
    And that's just what I see
        in my... department.

925
01:04:17,832 --> 01:04:20,967
    I hear about others
    who do different work.

926
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:25,638
    I've even heard there are
        other facilities...

927
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,472
            Cubes.

928
01:04:27,474 --> 01:04:29,759
    Christ.

929
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:31,761
Well, I just
heard rumors.

930
01:04:31,763 --> 01:04:33,529
            Why can't we
            remember anything?

931
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:35,014
I don't know.
I always assumed

932
01:04:35,016 --> 01:04:36,482
it was so that
they could have

933
01:04:36,484 --> 01:04:37,967
a blank slate
to work with, but--

934
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:39,469
            Blank slate?

935
01:04:39,471 --> 01:04:42,171
        You bastards have been
        using us as lab rats.

936
01:04:42,173 --> 01:04:44,473
Hey, man, not me.
I'm just a computer guy--

937
01:04:44,475 --> 01:04:47,109
System checks,
stuff like that.

938
01:04:47,111 --> 01:04:48,895
            Oh, yeah. You just
            followed orders.

939
01:04:50,997 --> 01:04:52,832
    Yeah.

940
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:54,266
            You make me sick.

941
01:04:54,268 --> 01:04:55,868
Look, you got it all wrong.

942
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,370
I hate my job.

943
01:04:57,372 --> 01:05:00,005
        Your job? How can you
        do this to people?

944
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:02,007
It was your choice.

945
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:04,009
Look,
you volunteered,

946
01:05:04,011 --> 01:05:06,011
only you don't
remember anymore.

947
01:05:06,013 --> 01:05:09,348
At least, that's what
they told us. I...

948
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:11,016
                    You believed
                    them?

949
01:05:11,018 --> 01:05:13,185
Well, yeah. I saw
the consent forms...

950
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:14,687
except for yours.

951
01:05:14,689 --> 01:05:16,689
                You're lying.

952
01:05:16,691 --> 01:05:19,024
            Who would volunteer
            for this?

953
01:05:19,026 --> 01:05:22,127
Well, it was either this
or execution, so...

954
01:05:22,129 --> 01:05:23,712
                    What?

955
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:26,015
They say you're all
condemned prisoners

956
01:05:26,017 --> 01:05:28,017
who volunteer
for the experiments

957
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:30,352
instead of facing
the death penalty.

958
01:05:30,354 --> 01:05:32,538
            I never did anything
            to deserve this.

959
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:36,141
Yeah. Well, tell that
to Meyerhold, right?

960
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:42,548
    Hey! We're innocent,
        damn it!

961
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,551
            I didn't volunteer
            for this!

962
01:05:45,553 --> 01:05:46,552
I know. See,

963
01:05:46,554 --> 01:05:48,053
your consent form
was missing.

964
01:05:48,055 --> 01:05:49,555
                Shut up.

965
01:05:49,557 --> 01:05:52,558
            While you were doing
            your systems checks,

966
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,394
            did you happen to
            see a little girl?

967
01:05:55,396 --> 01:05:58,563
No. Yes. I mean...

968
01:05:58,565 --> 01:06:01,400
I saw her.

969
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:05,254
I saw one,
a little girl...

970
01:06:05,256 --> 01:06:07,472
in, uh, your dreams.

971
01:06:07,474 --> 01:06:08,774
                    What?

972
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,243
    Yeah.

973
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:13,178
It's hard to explain.
Uh... here.

974
01:06:15,315 --> 01:06:17,566
You see, another thing
they have us do

975
01:06:17,568 --> 01:06:20,837
is record the subjects'--
well, the people's dreams.

976
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:25,507
Her name's Anna, right?

977
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:34,600
        Haskell: They can see
        into our dreams?

978
01:06:34,602 --> 01:06:35,868
    Yeah.

979
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,838
        Where is my daughter,
        you piece of shit?!

980
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,339
I don't know.

981
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:41,774
            You're lying!

982
01:06:41,776 --> 01:06:43,609
No. Please.
I came to help.

983
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:45,044
                    Rains.

984
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:48,114
    We need him.

985
01:06:48,116 --> 01:06:49,615
                Why?

986
01:06:49,617 --> 01:06:51,284
I can show you
the exits.

987
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:54,386
            Ok. Go ahead.
            Where are they?

988
01:06:54,388 --> 01:06:56,621
You were wrong
about the cube.

989
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:59,624
It's only 25 rooms
all around.

990
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:02,127
Only 2 rooms
have "Z" coordinates,

991
01:07:02,129 --> 01:07:04,013
value 26.

992
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:07,115
They periodically move
to the perimeter,

993
01:07:07,117 --> 01:07:11,036
but those 2 exit points
are monitored.

994
01:07:11,038 --> 01:07:14,139
Now, there's supposed
to be an auxiliary exit

995
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:17,209
that leads directly
outside the cube.

996
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:19,644
        How do we get
        to that one?

997
01:07:19,646 --> 01:07:21,146
I don't know.

998
01:07:21,148 --> 01:07:23,082
                    So what use
                    is he?

999
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:27,652
        He can show us
    how to avoid the traps.

1000
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:29,654
Yes, definitely.

1001
01:07:29,656 --> 01:07:32,824
Ok. Just read me
the coordinates

1002
01:07:32,826 --> 01:07:35,760
from the surrounding
rooms, please.

1003
01:07:37,964 --> 01:07:41,933
            I was right.
            They're coordinates.

1004
01:07:43,503 --> 01:07:45,104
    Jax: Well, well...

1005
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:47,673
            it seems
    that our little mouse

1006
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:50,609
    is a rat after all.

1007
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:56,182
    Mr. Finn, could you do
something about that, please?

1008
01:07:56,184 --> 01:07:57,683
                    Yes, sir.

1009
01:07:57,685 --> 01:08:00,119
    ( computer beeping )

1010
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:07,710
    This one's "C, F, P."

1011
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:09,678
        ( sizzling )

1012
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,129
        What the hell?

1013
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:17,186
                    Damn.

1014
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:18,687
            What is it?

1015
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:21,190
The letters--
they just disappeared.

1016
01:08:21,192 --> 01:08:23,092
        What?

1017
01:08:25,278 --> 01:08:27,262
    They're all gone.

1018
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,221
    They know I'm here.

1019
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:37,723
    So now would be
    a good time to move.

1020
01:08:37,725 --> 01:08:40,226
            Good idea.
            You first.

1021
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:41,727
        ( door closes )

1022
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:43,462
    Ok.

1023
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:46,715
I can't make any promises,
but this should be the way.

1024
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:48,550
        Jax: Mr. Quigley,

1025
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:51,720
    could you isolate
that quadrant for me, please?

1026
01:08:51,722 --> 01:08:53,722
    ( computer beeping )

1027
01:08:53,724 --> 01:08:55,724
    Ah. Mr. Finn, show me

1028
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:58,727
the current trap configuration,
     <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

1029
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:01,430
    ( computer beeping )

1030
01:09:11,508 --> 01:09:14,693
        Mmm... <i>merci.</i>

1031
01:09:14,695 --> 01:09:17,246
        Now, let's make
        their life

1032
01:09:17,248 --> 01:09:21,550
    a little more interesting,
            shall we?

1033
01:09:37,517 --> 01:09:39,834
            Ohh!

1034
01:09:41,788 --> 01:09:44,289
            Ok.

1035
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:47,293
            Trapped.

1036
01:09:47,295 --> 01:09:50,562
    It sure looked easier
        from my desk.

1037
01:09:58,104 --> 01:09:59,738
                Ohh!

1038
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:19,325
They've trapped all
the rooms around us.

1039
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:20,826
Now what?

1040
01:10:20,828 --> 01:10:23,262
        Really glad
    you showed up to help.

1041
01:10:27,334 --> 01:10:30,836
    My god. I'm actually
    starting to enjoy myself.

1042
01:10:30,838 --> 01:10:33,339
        You know what?
    I think we should all

1043
01:10:33,341 --> 01:10:36,842
    keep getting together
and doing this a lot more often.

1044
01:10:36,844 --> 01:10:38,944
        ( telephone rings )

1045
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:45,468
            ( ring )

1046
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,053
Oh, goddamn it.

1047
01:10:48,855 --> 01:10:50,356
            What?

1048
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:52,291
            Sir.

1049
01:10:52,293 --> 01:10:54,309
            Yes, sir.
<i> </i>

1050
01:10:55,595 --> 01:10:56,929
            Yes, sir.

1051
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,966
        Sorry, sir.

1052
01:11:02,569 --> 01:11:05,287
        Right away, sir.

1053
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:08,357
        ( mockingly )
"Just finish it, you idiot."

1054
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:11,327
    Ungrateful cretins.
    You didn't hear that.

1055
01:11:11,329 --> 01:11:14,412
            Ok...

1056
01:11:14,414 --> 01:11:15,380
        gentlemen,

1057
01:11:15,382 --> 01:11:17,216
        we have the word
        from on high.

1058
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:19,218
        It's time to blow
        this popsicle stand.

1059
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,252
            Mr. Quigley.

1060
01:11:20,254 --> 01:11:21,253
                Sir?

1061
01:11:21,255 --> 01:11:23,388
        You heard the man.
        Just finish it.

1062
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:24,556
                    Yes, sir.

1063
01:11:30,013 --> 01:11:31,897
                Ok, ok.
                Let me think.

1064
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:32,898
                Let me think.
<i> </i>

1065
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,999
    ( electrical buzzing )

1066
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:37,937
What the--

1067
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:39,671
                Ah, christ!

1068
01:11:42,392 --> 01:11:44,426
                    Ohh!

1069
01:11:46,395 --> 01:11:48,230
    Ok, ok.

1070
01:11:48,232 --> 01:11:49,864
    Aah!

1071
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:54,787
    Now what
    do we do?

1072
01:11:54,789 --> 01:11:55,971
                        Ah...

1073
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:56,972
The floor.
The floor!

1074
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:01,360
I'm sorry.

1075
01:12:05,348 --> 01:12:06,815
                Goddamn it!

1076
01:12:06,817 --> 01:12:08,867
                I don't want to
                die in here!

1077
01:12:16,092 --> 01:12:18,977
        ( electronic humming )

1078
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:20,896
    What's happening?

1079
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:29,655
            What stopped it?

1080
01:12:29,657 --> 01:12:32,040
    Wynn: Uh... I don't know.

1081
01:12:39,966 --> 01:12:43,535
        Jax: Come on,
        you piece of...

1082
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:48,190
        What the hell?

1083
01:12:48,192 --> 01:12:50,726
I don't know, sir.
We suddenly lost contact.

1084
01:12:50,728 --> 01:12:54,463
    Yes. I can see that.
            Why?

1085
01:12:54,465 --> 01:12:57,132
Maybe the energy required
for the test itself

1086
01:12:57,134 --> 01:12:58,467
blew out the capacitor.

1087
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:00,135
I mean, we're not talking
state-of-the-art equip--

1088
01:13:00,137 --> 01:13:01,136
        ( whistles )

1089
01:13:01,138 --> 01:13:03,222
            Wrong.
    That's not how it works.

1090
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,924
        That's not how
        it was designed.

1091
01:13:05,926 --> 01:13:09,728
    Someone is screwing
    with the connection.

1092
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:10,929
            I don't know, sir.
            It isn't me.

1093
01:13:10,931 --> 01:13:12,631
Me neither, sir.

1094
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:20,505
            What?

1095
01:13:20,507 --> 01:13:22,507
        I have no idea.

1096
01:13:22,509 --> 01:13:24,943
        It's not me.
        I swear.

1097
01:13:31,517 --> 01:13:34,018
            Now, you wouldn't
            lie to me,

1098
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:37,522
            now, would you,
            Mr. Clod?

1099
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:39,508
    No, sir.

1100
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:42,527
Wouldn't think of it.

1101
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:43,962
                ( sniffing )

1102
01:13:48,702 --> 01:13:50,368
                Questions?
                Comments?

1103
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:53,138
                What are we
                waiting for?

1104
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:55,174
                Get us back
                on line.

1105
01:14:02,966 --> 01:14:04,182
            ( beeping )

1106
01:14:14,377 --> 01:14:15,710
                Damn.

1107
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:17,646
        Nothing.

1108
01:14:17,648 --> 01:14:19,982
                "Nothing" is
                not an answer.

1109
01:14:22,552 --> 01:14:24,553
Uh, excuse me, sir.

1110
01:14:24,555 --> 01:14:26,054
Excuse me.

1111
01:14:26,056 --> 01:14:28,056
                    What is it?

1112
01:14:28,058 --> 01:14:31,493
Uh... can I use
the facilities, sir?

1113
01:14:33,396 --> 01:14:34,897
                Just go!

1114
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:36,565
            For the love of...

1115
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:39,568
            Where do they find
            these people?

1116
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:41,570
    Quigley: I don't think
    it's the software, sir.

1117
01:14:41,572 --> 01:14:43,572
        Finn: It's definitely
        a hardware problem.

1118
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:45,089
Yoo-hoo. Listen.

1119
01:14:45,091 --> 01:14:48,744
This is getting
embarrassing now, ok?

1120
01:14:48,746 --> 01:14:50,462
I needn't remind
you gentlemen

1121
01:14:50,464 --> 01:14:52,964
that in a few minutes,
we'll have no choice

1122
01:14:52,966 --> 01:14:54,583
but to send people
in there, and it'll--

1123
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:55,918
Call me impulsive,

1124
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,586
but I could probably think
of a couple of names.

1125
01:14:57,588 --> 01:14:59,588
( coughing )
Quigley. Finn.

1126
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:00,923
You know,
right off the top--

1127
01:15:00,925 --> 01:15:01,924
        ( alarm sounding )

1128
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:03,425
What is that noise?

1129
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:05,093
        Something's wrong
    with the main power source.

1130
01:15:05,095 --> 01:15:06,428
                It's gone
                into reset mode.

1131
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,133
        What the hell
        is going on?

1132
01:15:12,135 --> 01:15:14,936
    Boot.

1133
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:22,060
                    Oh!

1134
01:15:37,126 --> 01:15:38,627
                    Oh, damn.

1135
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:41,230
        You can say
        that again.

1136
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:42,631
                    What?

1137
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:45,133
The power go out?

1138
01:15:45,135 --> 01:15:47,168
            Yep.

1139
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:50,372
                    So the traps
                    don't work.

1140
01:15:50,374 --> 01:15:53,141
        That's
    the good news, yeah.

1141
01:15:53,143 --> 01:15:55,643
What's
the bad news?

1142
01:15:55,645 --> 01:15:59,864
        It's gone
        into reset mode.

1143
01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:02,667
The system will restart itself
        in 10 minutes.

1144
01:16:02,669 --> 01:16:06,104
        The first routine
        that runs on restart

1145
01:16:06,106 --> 01:16:07,939
        is a clean sweep.

1146
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:09,658
That as bad
as it sounds?

1147
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,493
        The clean sweep program
        flash-incinerates

1148
01:16:11,495 --> 01:16:13,528
        anything still living
        in all the rooms.

1149
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:15,530
            So, we've
            got to move.

1150
01:16:15,532 --> 01:16:16,932
        Well, which way
        do we go?

1151
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:18,867
Uh... I don't know.

1152
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:21,670
Ok, ok. Last time
I ran the numbers,

1153
01:16:21,672 --> 01:16:24,706
you were pretty much
in the center of the structure.

1154
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:27,709
So I guess we just keep
going in the same direction

1155
01:16:27,711 --> 01:16:30,579
Until we get
to the edge, right?

1156
01:16:30,581 --> 01:16:31,846
            Great. So we're back
            to square one.

1157
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:34,149
Do you have
a better idea?!

1158
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:35,700
            No, I don't, because
            I'm not the one

1159
01:16:35,702 --> 01:16:37,202
            who uses people as
            fucking guinea pigs

1160
01:16:37,204 --> 01:16:38,203
            in this place!

1161
01:16:38,205 --> 01:16:42,640
Whoa! Wait.
Back to square one.

1162
01:16:42,642 --> 01:16:44,709
Dodd. Dodd
is the only one

1163
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:46,478
who could power it
down this quickly.

1164
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,214
But he knows
that the reset mode

1165
01:16:49,216 --> 01:16:51,649
would kick in.
So why would he...

1166
01:16:53,486 --> 01:16:55,954
Of course.

1167
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,722
The clean sweep
happens

1168
01:16:57,724 --> 01:17:00,509
after they realign
to zero position.

1169
01:17:00,511 --> 01:17:01,393
                    What?

1170
01:17:01,395 --> 01:17:04,129
Quick, let me see
your map.

1171
01:17:04,131 --> 01:17:07,232
    When the power comes on,
    the rooms are programmed

1172
01:17:07,234 --> 01:17:09,234
        to realign back
    to their original positions

1173
01:17:09,236 --> 01:17:11,436
    before the clean sweep
            starts.

1174
01:17:11,438 --> 01:17:13,405
    Now, if we're in one
    of the exit rooms,

1175
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:14,906
    like "A, Z, Z" here,

1176
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:16,742
    it'll move us
    to the perimeter,

1177
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:18,810
    and we'll have about...
    3 seconds to get out.

1178
01:17:18,812 --> 01:17:20,746
                    Before
                    it fries us.

1179
01:17:20,748 --> 01:17:22,648
    Yeah.

1180
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:27,735
    If that room hasn't moved,
    we might just make it.

1181
01:17:27,737 --> 01:17:29,871
            Come on.

1182
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:35,460
You know, Mr. Wodd has been
in the little boys room

1183
01:17:35,462 --> 01:17:37,762
an awfully long time.

1184
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:43,701
        ( system powering down )

1185
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,139
            Come on.

1186
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:51,259
            Gotcha.

1187
01:17:51,261 --> 01:17:53,261
            ( gasps )

1188
01:17:53,263 --> 01:17:55,764
                A noble attempt
                to save

1189
01:17:55,766 --> 01:17:58,499
                your protege,
                Mr. Dodd, but...

1190
01:18:00,302 --> 01:18:02,270
                quite foolish
                ultimately.

1191
01:18:02,272 --> 01:18:06,542
              May I have that
            widget back, please?

1192
01:18:06,544 --> 01:18:10,662
I don't think
I can do that, sir.

1193
01:18:12,298 --> 01:18:14,800
                Mr. Dodd, are
                you disobeying

1194
01:18:14,802 --> 01:18:16,735
                a direct order?

1195
01:18:20,139 --> 01:18:23,442
                Yes. There.

1196
01:18:25,545 --> 01:18:27,446
    ( gulp )

1197
01:18:30,817 --> 01:18:32,818
            ( pen rattling )

1198
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,320
            Cute...
            and rather cliche,

1199
01:18:35,322 --> 01:18:38,806
            in an endearing
            kind of way.

1200
01:18:38,808 --> 01:18:41,309
            Unfortunately,
            I do believe

1201
01:18:41,311 --> 01:18:46,314
    there is a penalty,
    a rather strict penalty

1202
01:18:46,316 --> 01:18:48,783
for sabotaging
state property.

1203
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:55,340
Ooh. Instant
paralysis.

1204
01:18:55,342 --> 01:18:57,842
They weren't kidding,
were they?

1205
01:18:57,844 --> 01:19:00,945
However, not to worry,
Mr. Dodd.

1206
01:19:03,015 --> 01:19:07,252
You still will
be able to feel.

1207
01:19:07,254 --> 01:19:09,771
        ( Dodd screams )

1208
01:19:14,343 --> 01:19:18,113
    All right. It's 5 minutes
        till reset.

1209
01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:21,349
I think I found the source
of our power problem.

1210
01:19:21,351 --> 01:19:24,969
        Does anyone know
        where this goes?

1211
01:19:24,971 --> 01:19:26,355
            Anyone?

1212
01:19:26,357 --> 01:19:27,956
That's the central
coupling.

1213
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,359
I got it, sir.

1214
01:19:30,361 --> 01:19:33,878
        Still doesn't solve
        our observation problem.

1215
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,880
        They could be
        escaping as we speak.

1216
01:19:35,882 --> 01:19:37,882
Sir, in less
than 5 minutes from now,

1217
01:19:37,884 --> 01:19:39,384
the clean sweep
kicks in,

1218
01:19:39,386 --> 01:19:41,386
and then I think
our problem will evaporate.

1219
01:19:41,388 --> 01:19:43,888
            Mr. Finn, I don't
            trust machines.

1220
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:45,890
            I have a machine
            to thank for this...

1221
01:19:45,892 --> 01:19:47,392
                ( tapping )

1222
01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:48,893
                and this.

1223
01:19:48,895 --> 01:19:50,395
            I need to see them

1224
01:19:50,397 --> 01:19:52,397
            with my own
            god-given eye.

1225
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:54,899
Of course, sir. I just...
I don't know how.

1226
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:56,334
                Shh!

1227
01:19:57,903 --> 01:19:59,904
            Sometimes I even
            amaze myself.

1228
01:19:59,906 --> 01:20:02,407
            Mr. Finn, one
            of our runaway rats

1229
01:20:02,409 --> 01:20:04,909
            is a former squad
            soldier, is he not?

1230
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:06,578
Yes, sir. That
would be Haskell,

1231
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,579
the big fellow.
<i> </i>

1232
01:20:07,581 --> 01:20:08,580
            Yeah,
            the big fellow.

1233
01:20:08,582 --> 01:20:10,415
            And they
            still bio-chip

1234
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:12,417
            the enlisted men,
            do they not?

1235
01:20:12,419 --> 01:20:15,420
Of course.
Sir, that's brilliant.

1236
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:16,521
                Ah.

1237
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:20,424
        Mr. Quigley
        comes through.

1238
01:20:20,426 --> 01:20:21,926
        Mr. Finn,
        acquire us an uplink

1239
01:20:21,928 --> 01:20:23,427
        to the squad
        surveillance network,

1240
01:20:23,429 --> 01:20:24,929
             <i>por favor.</i>

1241
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:26,865
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

1242
01:20:35,992 --> 01:20:38,059
            Time.

1243
01:20:38,061 --> 01:20:39,577
Just over
4 minutes.

1244
01:20:45,968 --> 01:20:47,318
    Aah!

1245
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,453
                    Hold on!

1246
01:20:48,455 --> 01:20:50,505
    Aah!

1247
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:52,040
            ( thud )

1248
01:20:58,948 --> 01:21:02,384
There's no way
he survived that.

1249
01:21:06,338 --> 01:21:09,441
We got to go.
Come on.

1250
01:21:21,987 --> 01:21:23,988
And we're locked on.

1251
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,990
        Sir, we have
        a visual.

1252
01:21:25,992 --> 01:21:28,527
It's a weak signal.

1253
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:31,479
            Ah. Your tax dollars
            hard at work.

1254
01:21:31,481 --> 01:21:33,882
            Well, transmit
            the kill code.

1255
01:21:36,018 --> 01:21:39,487
Pain inhibitors
activated.

1256

1257

                there yet?

1258
01:21:52,518 --> 01:21:53,918
        Wynn: Almost.

1259
01:22:01,577 --> 01:22:02,777

1260
01:22:07,366 --> 01:22:08,666
                    Move it!

1261
01:22:11,404 --> 01:22:13,305
                    Aah! Unh!

1262
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:17,108
Get off her!

                    Thanks.

1268
01:23:03,073 --> 01:23:05,073
    Yeah.

1269
01:23:05,075 --> 01:23:07,409
Ok. Come on.

1270
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,104
How much farther?

1271
01:23:19,106 --> 01:23:21,038
            We're almost there.

            Uh!

1274
01:23:35,105 --> 01:23:37,605
            It's ok.
        The power's out.

1275
01:23:37,607 --> 01:23:39,207

                Can't this thing
                go any faster?

1282

    Ohh!

1283
01:24:02,631 --> 01:24:05,633
Sir, we've got
the grid display back.

1284
01:24:05,635 --> 01:24:07,568
They're
at the perimeter.

1285

30 seconds
till clean sweep.

1286
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,141
    Well, I think it's time
    for our little surprise.

1287
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:16,077
I hope your shortcut worked,

Sorry, sir.

Well, welcome back,

You chose to become
a test subject

1345
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:21,115
many years ago.

1346
01:29:21,117 --> 01:29:23,618
Now you simply
don't remember that.

1347
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:25,787
Oh, it's all
standard procedure.

1348
01:29:25,789 --> 01:29:29,657
            But my job, Dodd,
            Owen, Chickliss.

1349
01:29:29,659 --> 01:29:32,477
All lab rats,
just like you--

1350
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:35,480
Observing the observers,
you know, that kind of thing.

1351
01:29:35,482 --> 01:29:37,915
"Oh, very, very
interesting results."

1352
01:29:40,018 --> 01:29:42,136
                    Wait!

1353
01:29:42,138 --> 01:29:44,973
You're actually
starting to bore me now.

1354
01:29:44,975 --> 01:29:46,975
                Where is she?

1355
01:29:46,977 --> 01:29:49,477
Oh, the elusive
Ms. Rains.

1356
01:29:49,479 --> 01:29:53,247
Uh... well, you needn't
worry about her.

1357
01:29:56,001 --> 01:29:58,169
        You didn't catch her.

1358
01:29:58,171 --> 01:29:59,670
            ( laughing )

1359
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:24,011
He's all yours.

1360
01:30:24,013 --> 01:30:26,013
                Don't touch me.

1361
01:30:26,015 --> 01:30:29,183
    Don't worry.
    This won't hurt.

1362
01:30:29,185 --> 01:30:30,801
            Wait!

1363
01:30:30,803 --> 01:30:34,955
            Aah!

1364
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:53,541
    Anna: Mommy, I'm cold.

1365
01:30:53,543 --> 01:30:56,544
        Why can't we
        have a fire?

1366
01:30:56,546 --> 01:31:02,049
    Rains: Shh. Because
the bad people might find us.

1367
01:31:02,051 --> 01:31:05,486
        Hey, I have
    something to show you.

1368
01:31:08,824 --> 01:31:12,076
        See? That's us.

1369
01:31:12,078 --> 01:31:16,080
    We're superheroes.

1370
01:31:16,082 --> 01:31:17,581
    These are very special

1371
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:21,085
    because they were drawn
    by a very special person.

1372
01:31:21,087 --> 01:31:24,021
Is he
a superhero, too?

1373
01:31:25,924 --> 01:31:27,591
            Yes.

1374
01:31:27,593 --> 01:31:29,526
        Yes, he is.

1375
01:32:01,109 --> 01:32:03,578
        Man: What's wrong
            with him?

1376
01:32:04,946 --> 01:32:08,716
            He doesn't seem
            to know we're here.

1377
01:32:08,718 --> 01:32:11,051
    This room is green.

1378
01:32:31,657 --> 01:32:33,591
    Hi there.

1379
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:38,663
            This room is green.

1380
01:32:38,665 --> 01:32:41,165
    Yes, it is.

1381
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,100
        Woman: What is it?
            Shock?

1382
01:32:45,003 --> 01:32:48,505
            I want to go back
            to the blue room.

1383
01:32:48,507 --> 01:32:51,175
I think he's
mentally handicapped.

1384
01:32:51,177 --> 01:32:53,177
                That's all we
                need-- a retard.

1385
01:32:53,179 --> 01:32:54,344
            Don't.

1386
01:32:54,346 --> 01:32:56,446
How the hell did he
survive in here?

1387
01:32:58,183 --> 01:33:02,186
        I want to go back.
        I want to go back.

1388
01:33:02,188 --> 01:33:04,688
            Back. Back.

1389
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:10,194
        I want to go back.
        I want to go... back.
