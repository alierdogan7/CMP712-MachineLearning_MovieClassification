1
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,822
Camila.

2
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,413
Ready?

3
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,507
- I'm coming.
- You'll never beat me.

4
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,926
My God, look at this little town.
How cute is this?

5
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,216
Wow.

6
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,763
Oh, come here.

7
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,604
- Hola.
- Hola.

8
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,198
You know, we're close to that river
that used to be

9
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,739
Argentina's main trade route
into Paraguay.

10
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,418
Apparently it used to be
a pretty happening town.

11
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,419
A lot of smugglers
and rough types.

12
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,421
Really?

13
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,833
I like it already.

14
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,967
Pick one.

15
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,298
Uh...

16
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,589
- this one. Yeah.
- This one?

17
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,428
Thanks.

18
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,103
Here you go.
You can keep the change.

19
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,226
Thanks.
I mean, gracias.

20
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,979
De nada.

21
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,114
Go on, ask her.

22
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,625
- Go.
- Um...

23
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,754
Buenas tardes.

24
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,962
Um, donde está
El Hotel Rosarnaria?

25
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,888
Okay. Gracias.

26
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,645
Did you get all that?

27
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,772
Shut up.

28
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,015
Hello?

29
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,188
Hola.

30
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,898
- Hello?
- Hola.

31
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,360
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.

32
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,526
Um, me llamo es Stephanie.

33
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,410
Mm-hmm.

34
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,196
Y nosotros tenemos un, um...

35
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,035
You have a reservation?

36
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,371
- You speak English.
- Yes.

37
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,958
Luca.

38
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,667
You stay only one night, yes?

39
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,460
Yes.
Actually, we leave tomorrow.

40
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,551
Do you know what time the bus
to Posadas leaves?

41
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,102
At 8 o'clock.
And it's the only one of the day.

42
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,555
Please tell me that's 8:00 PM.

43
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,313
I'm sorry.
It's 8 o'clock in the morning.

44
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,849
Figures.

45
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,017
- Your passport, please.
- Oh yeah.

46
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,278
Ellie.

47
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,112
"Assport"?

48
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,446
Ellie.

49
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,906
That's a good one.

50
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,285
You are not traveling alone,
are you?

51
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,455
Um, well, yes and no.

52
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,089
We were traveling with a bike tour

53
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,593
but we kind of went AWOL
after the first day.

54
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,130
Yes, I see.

55
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,472
Well, please let me know
if you need anything.

56
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,307
- Cool.
- Thank you.

57
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,595
Okay.

58
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,639
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

59
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:18,999
One key.

60
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,964
Oh, gracias.

61
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,254
- Ah.
- Weirdo.

62
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,093
Cute.

63
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,883
Yeah, this is cute.

64
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,768
Hmm.

65
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,815
Whoa!

66
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,739
First shower.

67
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,648
Ugh, this is gross.

68
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,143
Ugh.
Hey, Steph.

69
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,902
There's no towels.

70
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,439
Yeah, coming.

71
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,158
Here are your towels.

72
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,820
Danke schoen.

73
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,851
What did you say to those guys?

74
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,180
Nothing, just that you're single.

75
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,855
Gee, thanks, El.

76
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,526
Okay, I like the potential.

77
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,489
Yeah, it's nice.

78
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,776
Oh, excuse me.
Two cervezas, por favor.

79
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,821
Gracias.

80
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,539
Is that Nick?

81
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,127
Seriously?
He's such a dick.

82
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,130
I know.

83
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,295
But maybe I should
just talk to him.

84
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,009
No. No no no.
Don't even think...

85
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,515
it's so not worth it.

86
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,266
I know, but...

87
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,098
You know I'm not...

88
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,512
I'm not good
at being alone.

89
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,306
I know, but I'm right here.

90
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,770
Okay?

91
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,152
- We had fun.
- Yeah, absolutely.

92
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,609
We're about to have more fun too.

93
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,695
Gracias.

94
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,156
Um, disculpe.

95
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,163
We didn't order these.

96
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,664
Don't be rude.

97
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,970
Mmm!

98
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,007
Whoo!
All right!

99
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,523
- No no.
- Yeah yeah.

100
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,817
- Ellie, no. Seriously, I'm done.
- Just shut up and drink.

101
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,235
Tomorrow's gonna suck.

102
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,519
Yes, but that's what Advil is for.

103
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,278
Come on, it's our last night.

104
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,781
To you and me.

105
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,783
Salud.

106
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,490
- I can't...
- That was hard.

107
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,035
Whoo.

108
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,220
What about him?

109
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,723
I don't know.
You think he's my type?

110
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,100
Totally.
He looks...

111
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,057
Responsible.

112
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,314
Should I invite him over?
I can totally invite him over.

113
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,449
- No. El, stop. Sit down.
- I’m gonna do that for you.

114
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,997
Jesus, sit down! Sit down!
He's gonna look over here, Ellie.

115
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,201
- Stay.
- Isn't that the point?

116
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,163
Oh my God.
Are you hearing this?

117
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,044
Do you hear this? Please don't
tell me you're not hearing this.

118
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,171
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing us all a favor.

119
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,584
Oh no no,
you cannot play that song.

120
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,893
Ugh, Ellie.

121
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,847
My friend wants to know
why you don't like the song.

122
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,890
Well, 'cause there's a fine line
between irony and just plain bad.

123
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,194
Kind of like...

124
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,817
Your shirt.

125
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,773
All right.
No.

126
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,943
Nope.

127
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,111
Okay.

128
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,412
This one's for you, baby.

129
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,290
¶ I love myself ¶

130
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,210
¶ I want you to love me ¶

131
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,176
¶ When I feel down,
I want you above me ¶

132
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,640
¶ I search myself,
I want you to find me ¶

133
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:08,557
¶ I forget myself,
I want you to remind me ¶

134
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,691
¶ I don't want anybody else ¶

135
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
¶ When I think about you ¶

136
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,491
¶ I touch myself, ooh ¶

137
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,325
¶ I don't want anybody else... ¶

138
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,160
- Senor.
- ¶ Oh no oh no ¶

139
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,995
¶ Oh no... ¶

140
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,626
Hey hey hey.
Take it easy.

141
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,753
- No problem here.
- ¶ You're the one ¶

142
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,210
¶ Who makes me come running ¶

143
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,344
¶ You're the sun
who makes me shine ¶

144
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:41,348
¶ When you're around
I'm always laughing... ¶

145
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,258
Hey, where are you going?

146
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,847
Um, el peepee.

147
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,765
¶ I close my eyes
and see you above me ¶

148
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,402
¶ Think I would die
if you were to ignore me... ¶

149
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,698
Girl emergency.
Sorry.

150
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,113
¶ I'd do anything for you ¶

151
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,909
¶ I don't want anybody else... ¶

152
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,628
¶ Oh, I don't want... ¶

153
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,933
You're not from around
these parts, are you?

154
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,640
Performance anxiety?

155
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,105
You should stick close
to your friend.

156
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,494
Wow.
That backfired.

157
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,411
¶ I honestly do,
I touch myself ¶

158
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,420
¶ I touch myself. ¶

159
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,139
- Hello.
- Hi.

160
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,729
- Do you want to sit?
- Yeah. Thank you.

161
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,315
- Let me take your picture.
- Okay.

162
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,776
- Did you get it?
- Mm, I got it.

163
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,321
Let me take one of you.

164
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,659
- You think so?
- Yeah, I like it.

165
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,006
Now you're my prisoner.

166
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,590
Really?

167
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,926
- Does that mean I'm in trouble?
- Big trouble.

168
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,229
What?
What does that mean?

169
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,689
- It means that you...
- Yeah?

170
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,570
- your friend...
- My friend?

171
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,777
- and I...
- Uh-huh.

172
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,534
No way, Jose.

173
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,661
Not with that one.

174
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,290
Mmm.

175
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,562
Ooh!

176
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,278
Oh my God.

177
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,535
You'll wake her up.

178
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,866
- Shh.
- Shh.

179
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,031
Silencio, por favor.

180
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,846
Let's go to my place.

181
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
Your place?
No no no. We can't.

182
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,142
Who says?

183
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,769
- Me says.
- Oh, you says?

184
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,601
Yeah, me...

185
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,934
- Come on, you're gonna love it.
- I know I'll love it.

186
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,572
I know.
I just can't.

187
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,073
My friend, she's in...

188
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,609
she's inside.

189
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,324
Well, tell her to come.
Tell her to come.

190
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,999
I'm not gonna tell her to come.

191
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,664
Come on.

192
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,669
I live really close to here.

193
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,000
- I don't... we can't.
- Okay?

194
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,256
- I told you I can't go.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

195
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,713
I'm not gonna come with you.

196
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,378
Okay, all right.
This hurts.

197
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,013
Ow, stop!
What the hell?

198
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,684
- Hey!
- Let me go!

199
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,308
- Get away from me!
- Come inside!

200
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,854
- Hey hey!
- Steph.

201
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,980
Come on, we are just having...

202
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,937
Keep 'em closed.

203
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,774
He's mean. Oh!

204
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,036
What? Habla la bamba?

205
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,947
Girls, open the goddamn door!

206
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,368
- Ooh.
- Jesus, you trying to get us killed?

207
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,832
Ellie, come outside.

208
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,872
Ellie!

209
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,130
Hey, asshole.

210
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,102
Qué pasa?

211
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,069
Qué pasa?

212
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,083
Sorry, girls.

213
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,209
Maybe next time, all right?

214
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,755
You too.

215
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,778
Hey, Steph.

216
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,156
You saved me.

217
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,473
Aw shit. Ellie, get up.
We're late.

218
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:24,511
Oh, no no no no.

219
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,805
Oh no.

220
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,393
I’m not kidding, El.

221
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,354
- We cannot miss that bus.
- Oh no.

222
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,029
Wait!

223
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,697
Don't leave us here!

224
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,776
Wait!

225
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,656
No!

226
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,163
Oh, we're screwed.

227
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,329
- We'll just take the next bus.
- There is no next bus.

228
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,793
Oh yeah.

229
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,425
Why did this have to happen
to us on the last day?

230
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,882
Everything was going so great
until now.

231
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,342
Come on, let's go back.

232
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,396
So that's flight 206
at 1600 hours.

233
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,108
Um, that's 4:00 PM, right?

234
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,819
Okay. No, that's fine.
Thank you.

235
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,575
Thank you, bye.

236
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,077
Are we good?

237
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,203
No, Ellie, we're not good.

238
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,035
We're both out 200 bucks.

239
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,416
Oh my gosh.
Wake me up never.

240
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:35,127
Come on, let's at least
do something fun.

241
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,041
I am doing something fun.

242
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,013
You have not left.

243
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,927
Oh no.
Actually, we missed our bus.

244
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,438
But we wanted to go to this place...
Villa Del Lago.

245
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,439
Have you heard of it?

246
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,066
They say the water there
can cure polio.

247
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,731
I don't have polio.

248
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,741
Villa Del Lago.

249
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,200
No, it's a ghost town now.
There is nothing to see.

250
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,866
If you must go somewhere,

251
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:14,128
go to see the waterfalls
or to see the caves.

252
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,630
- They are beautiful.
- That sounds like fun.

253
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,297
Ellie.

254
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,554
All right, well, thank you.
Thank you. That's great.

255
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,275
Rosa.

256
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,787
- Permiso, chicas.
- Thanks.

257
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,164
- Come on.
- Huh-uh.

258
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,955
- Come on, Ellie, let's go.
- Huh-uh, no!

259
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,465
Wake up.

260
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,422
Dude, stop!

261
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,698
Oh, look at that.

262
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,010
Wow.

263
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,303
Hey, let's just lay out here.

264
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,218
- Ellie, really?
- Come on, just relax.

265
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,513
We really don't have
anywhere to be.

266
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,934
You win.

267
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,089
Here, sunshine.

268
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,966
It will all be okay.

269
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,219
I promise.

270
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,262
Thanks, El.

271
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,310
All right.

272
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,907
¶ I'm feeling blind ¶

273
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,663
¶ Like the sun's in my eyes ¶

274
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,200
¶ Since I'm fighting in a losing war ¶

275
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,917
¶ Tiny little fault lines
cracking inside my soul... ¶

276
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,262
¶ I'm alive... ¶

277
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,765
You ready?

278
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,694
Ellie, I know you can hear me.

279
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,401
- Let's go.
- Huh-uh, later.

280
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,410
And when exactly is later?

281
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,741
I don't know, Steph.
When I'm ready.

282
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,460
Ow! What the hell?
I said I'm not ready.

283
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,713
Well, I am.
El, we can’t be here all day.

284
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,626
You really really need to learn
to have some fun.

285
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,511
And what,
you're gonna teach me, I suppose?

286
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,673
Yeah, actually.
I probably could.

287
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,841
Where would we start, huh?

288
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,557
The men's bathroom?
That sounds like fun.

289
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,356
Okay.
No, that's great.

290
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,767
I see where this is going.

291
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,027
- Forget it.
- No.

292
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,189
Forget it. No, you're right.
If you didn't care before attacking him

293
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,153
in the bathroom, you're certainly
not gonna care now.

294
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,943
Okay, Steph, I'm sorry.

295
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,865
If it's any consolation,
he didn't take the bait.

296
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,576
It's still really shitty, Ellie.

297
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,374
- I guess you can't help it.
- What?

298
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,840
You know what? I probably actually
should have done something.

299
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,345
Because God knows
you never would have.

300
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,972
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

301
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,179
You know what?
Just... just forget about it.

302
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,016
No, bullshit forget it.
Say what you mean.

303
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,603
I mean, Steph, God forbid you take
a chance on another guy

304
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,393
instead of dwelling
on the same old one.

305
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,983
He said we’d work it out, El.

306
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,739
Stephanie, he cheated on you.

307
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,320
This is crazy to me that
you're still defending him.

308
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,872
You should have dumped
that guy right on the spot.

309
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,200
But you didn't.
And now you're hurt

310
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,118
and I have to pick up your pieces
of yet another disaster relationship.

311
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,163
What? Is this coming
from you, the expert?

312
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,172
You think a relationship is when
you get the guy's last name.

313
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,209
Wow.

314
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,753
You know what?
Screw you.

315
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,671
Nice.

316
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,105
Steph, wait.

317
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,891
Where are you going?

318
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,106
What do you care?
You're on vacation, Ellie.

319
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,442
I don't want you to have to worry
about cleaning up after me.

320
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,107
Have fun.

321
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,053
Come on, El, where are you?

322
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,382
Oh my...

323
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,609
So it's me.

324
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,444
Um, where are you?

325
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,700
I'm at the cow place now.

326
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,953
Um, okay.
So call me.

327
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,159
Bye.

328
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,225
Hey'

329
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,440
- Hi.
- Where's your friend?

330
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,070
Coming.

331
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,231
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

332
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,160
Any minute now.

333
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,708
Oh hey, thanks for your help
last night with that guy.

334
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,663
- He was a real creep.
- Yeah, he was.

335
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,461
You know what?
Probably got a flat or something.

336
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,547
I'd better go.
But see you around, uh...

337
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,838
- Michael.
- Stephanie.

338
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,019
Hey, where are you going?
I'll give you a lift.

339
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,557
No, I'm okay.
Thanks though.

340
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,688
Wait! No!

341
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,564
Somebody! No!

342
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,453
No!

343
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,505
Hey'

344
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,134
You follow me here?

345
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,891
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

346
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,890
Are you?
'Cause you don't look it.

347
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,317
Her bike is gone.

348
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,819
Well...

349
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,447
Well, maybe she left already.

350
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,448
No, there's only one road.

351
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,860
I mean, we would have
passed each other.

352
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,324
Right.

353
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,912
I'm gonna go inside
and look for her.

354
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,416
Are you sure this is the place?

355
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,961
Yeah, I'm positive.

356
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,641
Do you hear that?

357
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,053
- It's over here somewhere.
- Ellie!

358
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,680
Who are you calling?

359
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,561
The police.

360
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,228
Good luck with that.

361
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,223
- Hola.
- Hola.

362
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,726
- Michael.
- Calvo.

363
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,736
- What did he say?
- We're gonna show him.

364
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,640
Here, give me the phone.

365
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,427
Calvo.

366
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,503
- What did he just ask?
- He asked...

367
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,294
Why were you and your friend
not together?

368
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,472
We got separated.

369
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,304
Separated?
How did you get separated?

370
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,810
It was stupid.
We got in a fight.

371
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,471
Oh.

372
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,561
Well, I am sure she will forgive you.

373
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,772
Wait, where are you going?

374
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,231
Your friend is fine.

375
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:05,115
When she realizes she has lost her
phone she will come back to find it.

376
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,321
Senor, please wait.
Where are you going?

377
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,656
Calvo.

378
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,412
Michael.

379
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,499
Do yourself a favor
and find another lover.

380
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,665
This one has a habit
of losing his girlfriends.

381
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,008
Hey. Hey!

382
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,425
I am very sorry, but I...

383
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,593
She was with a guy last night.

384
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,013
What did he look like?

385
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,273
He was tall.

386
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,354
He had brown hair.

387
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,655
Brown hair?

388
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,189
You just described half
of Argentina.

389
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,859
- Did you get his name?
- No, I didn't.

390
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,995
- Could you identify him?
- Yeah.

391
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:55,123
Yeah, if I saw him again
I'm sure I could.

392
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,704
Well, when you do see him
you can call me,

393
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,995
but now there is nothing I can do.

394
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,336
Please. Please.

395
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,593
Okay.

396
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,549
You may make a report if you want.

397
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,260
Yeah, that...
thank you.

398
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,222
Can I ride with you?

399
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,226
- Of course.
- Okay.

400
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,142
You want me to come with you?

401
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,776
No, Michael.
Thank you.

402
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,734
I think I can handle
the situation from here.

403
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,819
Yeah, I'll be fine.

404
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,195
Just because he speaks English
does not mean you should trust him.

405
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,614
I don't know if I trust
anybody right now.

406
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,651
All done.

407
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,942
Wait, that's it?

408
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,531
- That's it.
- No.

409
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,038
We should be out there
looking for her.

410
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,666
I mean, we can still make
a search party before it gets dark.

411
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,497
A search party?

412
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,004
Where do you think you are?
This is not America.

413
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,383
Does it look like I can
make a search party?

414
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,170
Then what else can we do?

415
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,511
Today? Nothing.

416
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,061
Nothing?

417
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:23,643
Please, you should not
worry so much.

418
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,853
Your friend is just having her fun.

419
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,313
My friend is not out there
having fun, okay?

420
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,854
I know her.

421
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,523
She wouldn't just leave me like this.

422
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,159
The way you left her alone
in a foreign country?

423
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,666
I'm sorry.

424
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,250
I will do everything in my power.

425
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,211
You have my word.

426
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,047
This is so messed up.

427
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,046
Is there someone else I can talk to?

428
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,841
You're tired.

429
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,602
Why don't you go back to the hotel
and take a siesta?

430
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,395
You want me to take a nap
while my best friend is missing?

431
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:12,108
Yes.
I think you will feel much better.

432
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,484
It's okay.
Look, if she's not back tomorrow,

433
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,995
we'll file a missing persons report
with federal police in Buenos Aires.

434
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,576
Okay?

435
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,910
Okay.

436
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,919
Good.

437
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,103
Everything will be all right.
You'll see.

438
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:19,179
Disculpe me.

439
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,845
Uh...

440
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,970
I'm looking for my friend.

441
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,855
Senora.
I'm just looking for my friend.

442
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,938
Mi amiga. Senora?

443
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,343
Oh, excuse me.
Can you help me?

444
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:02,176
I'm looking for my friend.
I can't find her.

445
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:05,342
Senora?
I just want to ask...

446
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,510
I just...

447
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,893
Senora, please.

448
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,192
Hey, wait.

449
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,735
Hey!

450
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,245
I just want to talk to you.

451
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,513
Wait.

452
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,343
Hey!

453
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,008
Ellie?

454
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,904
Hello?

455
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,994
Michael?

456
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,738
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

457
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,708
Look what I found.
It was in his room.

458
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,873
- It's Ellie's.
- Whose room?

459
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,211
Michael's.

460
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,513
Okay.

461
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,048
I will question him,

462
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,309
but only if you go
back to the hotel and wait for me.

463
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,597
You let me do my job.
Is that fair?

464
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,399
- Okay.
- Good.

465
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,915
What's wrong?

466
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:08,838
Ellie's gone.

467
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,719
Gone?

468
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,100
We got in a fight
and I went on without her.

469
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,104
I've got to...
I've got to find her.

470
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,395
Come inside.
Have something to drink.

471
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,193
Come on.
it's okay.

472
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,077
Come on.

473
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,524
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

474
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,750
Hey'

475
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,127
- Please don't! No!
- Just wait!

476
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,709
- No, let me go!
- Hey! I won't hurt you.

477
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,920
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop, no! Stop it!

478
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,427
- Get off me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

479
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,221
What's the matter with you?

480
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,772
Where did you get this?

481
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,808
You went through my things?

482
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,648
Where did you get this?

483
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,688
Look, it belongs to someone I know.

484
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,948
Bullshit!
This is Ellie's.

485
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,951
What did you do with her?

486
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,832
Look, I swear to God I've got nothing
to do with your friend, okay?

487
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,662
You have to trust me.
Look.

488
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:35,453
Look, please.
Would you just take a look at this?

489
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,088
Okay?
Just take a look at it.

490
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,976
Her name is Camila.

491
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,351
She disappeared
somewhere around here.

492
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:54,184
That's her bracelet.

493
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:59,981
I've been up and down these roads
100 times looking for her.

494
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,115
Oh God.

495
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,578
I'm so sorry.

496
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,454
I'm sorry.

497
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,953
You know, when we met
she was organizing

498
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,839
a humanitarian mission
to South America.

499
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:25,799
And I wanted to be with her
so I went too.

500
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,339
What happened?

501
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,935
About six months ago
we came to work here.

502
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:37,394
One day she took the truck
into town to get some supplies

503
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,184
and that's the last I saw of her.

504
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,068
Nobody knows what happened.

505
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,071
And if they do,
they're not saying anything.

506
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,904
I'd do anything to get her back.

507
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,866
And I'm not leaving this country
until I find her.

508
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,828
Did you call the police?

509
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,833
Calvo?

510
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,666
Yeah, he filled out a form.

511
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,751
Oh no.

512
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,837
God.

513
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,253
I'm gonna be sick.

514
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,179
Oh God.

515
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,471
I can't...

516
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,857
Look, I've been hearing things

517
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,985
about young women, girls,
who've been abducted

518
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,441
and taken across the river
into Paraguay.

519
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,483
I don't know if that's what's
happened to your friend.

520
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:31,368
I mean, it's rare.
it's risky to kidnap an American.

521
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,620
But it does happen.

522
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,656
That's why I tried to warn her.

523
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,665
Oh.

524
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,667
I have to find her.

525
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,214
I have to find Ellie.

526
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:42,963
Okay.

527
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,465
Well, I mean, chances are
she's probably still in the area.

528
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,752
It's too risky to move her
during daylight.

529
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,341
But we need to find her
before it gets dark.

530
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,633
- How?
- We need to split up.

531
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,676
Now I'll understand if you
don't want to do that.

532
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,765
But we can cover more ground
if you do.

533
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,608
No, you're right.
You're right.

534
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,940
Okay, I'll meet you back here
in an hour.

535
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,571
Yeah.

536
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,248
Ellie!

537
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,494
Ellie!

538
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,206
Ellie!

539
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:11,710
Ellie!

540
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,526
Oh shit.

541
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:21,955
Michael, you're becoming
a hard man to find.

542
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:25,084
Surely you must be lost.

543
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,086
You know me,
just seeing the sights.

544
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,918
Yes, of course you are.

545
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,174
Have you seen Stephanie?

546
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:34,130
No.

547
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,556
Because a car has been stolen

548
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,260
and that does not happen
very often around here.

549
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,051
Wow.
A stolen car.

550
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,221
Did you find Stephanie's friend?

551
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,392
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

552
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,112
So her friend is still missing

553
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,115
and you're looking for a car?

554
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,447
Okay.

555
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,366
Come with me.
Let's take a drive.

556
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,889
Water.

557
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,612
Chucho,

558
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,995
I know you're not a bad guy.

559
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,334
I can tell by the way
you kissed me.

560
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,127
Come here and kiss me again.

561
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,715
Come here.

562
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:51,892
Come here.

563
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,898
So you want that?

564
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,525
I want you.

565
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,859
No!

566
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,288
Help!

567
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,868
Hey hey.

568
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,032
No!

569
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,076
Oh my God!

570
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,413
Don't! No!

571
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,379
Bastard!

572
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,919
Shh.

573
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,557
You fucking bastard.

574
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,061
Help me!

575
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,606
Stop it!

576
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,195
Fuck you!

577
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,284
Oh God, get me out of here, please.

578
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:41,214
Well, seems that tonight is your night.

579
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:00,984
Listen.

580
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:04,396
Don't you move, okay?

581
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,705
Steph. Hurry hurry.

582
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,794
- Ellie. Ellie, are you okay?
- Steph.

583
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,503
- Are you okay?
- I just want to go home.

584
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,543
- Let's go home.
- We're gonna go home.

585
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,308
Shh Shh.

586
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,721
- Get this off me.
- Hold still.

587
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,110
- You can do it, right?
- Oh, he's coming!

588
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:28,488
- Shit. Come on. Come on.
- Hey!

589
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,740
Hey!

590
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:37,788
Let's go!

591
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,279
- Ellie, come on. Hurry hurry.
- Go, go.

592
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,658
Lock it! Lock it!

593
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,950
- Oh God! Oh God!
- Go, Steph, now. Come on, go.

594
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,703
- Oh shit.
- Get it! Get it!

595
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,792
- Shit.
- Come on, come on, come on!

596
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,753
Okay okay okay.

597
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:30,542
Open the door.

598
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:35,305
- Steph, watch out!
- Come on, come on, come on!

599
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,477
Come on, come on!

600
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,729
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

601
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,485
Where'd he go?

602
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,317
Shh.

603
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,484
No!

604
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,871
Watch out!

605
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,555
Wait, stop!

606
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:24,847
Ellie. Ellie.
Oh my God.

607
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,482
Oh my God.
Ellie, come on.

608
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,642
Oh my God.

609
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,686
Ellie, please. Ellie!

610
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,527
Ellie!

611
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,786
Ellie!

612
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,993
Ellie!

613
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,625
Hey, get off of her!

614
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,081
Ellie.

615
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:51,881
Ellie, please.

616
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,042
Ellie.

617
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,711
She's dead!

618
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,757
She's dead!

619
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,482
Oh my God.

620
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,105
Stephanie, is this the man

621
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,564
you say was with your friend
the other night?

622
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,072
- Yes!
- Stephanie, get into the truck.

623
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,739
It's for your safety.
Trust me.

624
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,904
Now!

625
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,748
Oh my God.

626
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,007
She was very desirable.

627
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,926
What a waste.

628
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,610
"Assport"?
Clever.

629
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,021
That's a good one.

630
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,081
Michael!
it's him, Michael!

631
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,368
- Michael!
- But that one

632
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:12,959
will do fine in her place,
don't you think?

633
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,259
- Michael.
- Shut up.

634
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,642
Get away from the car.
Where is she?

635
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:31,476
Just put the gun down.

636
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,312
Where's Camila?

637
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,772
Michael, we can still
help each other.

638
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,859
- But you must put the gun down.
- On your knees.

639
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:47,531
Shut up!
On your knees.

640
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,580
Think for a second.

641
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:59,672
If you kill me then who will tell you
where to find Camila?

642
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,976
Just put the gun down
and let's talk, okay? Man to man.

643
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,354
I think we can work out something
that will satisfy us both.

644
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,186
- Where is she?
- She's safe. Trust me.

645
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,521
Where is she?

646
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:24,359
I swear to you no harm
has come to her.

647
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,739
Okay.

648
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:33,160
I can bring her to you,
but we must trade.

649
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,538
You piece of shit.

650
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,209
This is the only way.

651
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,379
Stephanie for Camila.

652
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,433
It's simple, Michael.

653
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,695
Stephanie for Camila.

654
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,421
No.

655
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:23,676
I'm sorry.

656
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,633
Michael, no!

657
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,301
I hope you're going
to be a good girl

658
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,091
and play nice.

659
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,931
'Cause if you give me any trouble,

660
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:17,518
I swear I will cut you so bad

661
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,901
you will not even make $10 per day
sucking cock in the streets.

662
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,032
Please.

663
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:34,702
What if I told you that you
are only worth $2,000?

664
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,617
$6,000 if you're a virgin, but...

665
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:42,758
are you a virgin?

666
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,502
Get away!
Stop it!

667
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:51,514
Stop. No.
No, I don't think you're a virgin.

668
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,816
Please.
I'm sorry.

669
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,398
Don't worry, you're American,

670
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,188
not some brown peasant.

671
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,949
You're worth much more.

672
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:45,147
It's lucky for you my partner
across the river is open-minded.

673
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:48,062
You see, he is a businessman too.

674
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:51,449
And they think you could
make a nice accessory...

675
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,405
for one of his clients.

676
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,704
Night night.

677
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,988
Get up.

678
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,994
I should kill you.

679
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,281
Then you would owe me
a lot of money.

680
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:27,790
Pick her up.

681
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,960
- I don't like this.
- What's not to like?

682
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,376
- This is what we discussed.
- This is dangerous.

683
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,637
Girls like her...
people will look for her.

684
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,672
Then put her someplace
no one will find her.

685
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,513
So easy for you.

686
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,305
Please.
Please.

687
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,983
Your greed is going
to get you killed one day.

688
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,735
And you,

689
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,864
you'd better be worth the trouble.

690
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,320
Never!

691
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,528
Help! Help!

692
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,704
Help, somebody!
Help!

693
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,122
Please!

694
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:00,087
Please wake up!

695
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,718
Please help me.

696
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,880
Help me, please! Help me!

697
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:38,199
Stephanie, please.
Give me the gun.

698
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:44,205
Come on.
Be a good girl.

699
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,375
Just give me the gun!

700
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:26,231
It's okay.
It's okay.

701
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:44,177
¶ When I woke this morning ¶

702
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:49,520
¶ I saw that you were still gone ¶

703
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,434
¶ And just for the weekend ¶

704
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,526
¶ Just sayin' I think
that's way too long ¶

705
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:00,238
¶ I toss in these sweaty sheets,
no sleep ¶

706
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:04,780
¶ The clock is wailing on and on
and on and on ¶

707
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:08,668
¶ Who in the hell was I
to come here ¶

708
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:12,295
¶ All alone
on my own? ¶

709
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,206
¶ But you you you ¶

710
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:15,966
¶ I love you ¶

711
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,754
¶ More than I ever wanted to ¶

712
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,093
¶ It's all I am ¶

713
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:25,509
¶ All I do is sit around ¶

714
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:27,599
¶ And remember you ¶

715
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:33,439
¶ I'm on my knees now ¶

716
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:37,651
¶ Please turn around
and come home ¶

717
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:43,035
¶ I left my cold soul
on the ground ¶

718
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:55,794
¶ I can't believe I'm falling apart ¶

719
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:59,426
¶ I need your needle in my arm ¶

720
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:03,464
¶ 10cc might suit me ¶

721
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,804
¶ I'd rather all day
than go without ¶

722
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:09,015
¶ Your arms ¶

723
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:14,149
¶ I'm drying up
without this cocoon ¶

724
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:18,232
¶ Well, I want to be your monarch ¶

725
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:22,320
¶ Pin me up to the wall
in your bedroom ¶

726
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:25,827
¶ But you you you,
I love you ¶

727
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:29,786
¶ More than I ever wanted to ¶

728
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,996
¶ It's all I am ¶

729
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:35,333
¶ All I do is sit around ¶

730
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,372
¶ And remember you ¶

731
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:43,546
¶ I'm on my knees now ¶

732
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,515
¶ Please turn around
and come home ¶

733
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:52,771
¶ I left my cold soul
on the ground ¶

734
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,987
¶ I'm all alone ¶

735
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,290
¶ I'm all alone ¶

736
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,076
¶ I'm on my knees ¶

737
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,960
¶ I'm all alone ¶

738
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:17,871
¶ I'm begging you ¶

739
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:21,383
¶ Come back to me ¶

740
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,761
¶ Come back
to me ¶

741
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:31,677
¶ I'm on my knees now... ¶

742
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,602
¶ Please turn around
and come home ¶

743
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:41,737
¶ I left my cold soul
on the ground ¶

744
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:46,321
¶ Come home, come home ¶

745
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,110
¶ Come home ¶

746
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,665
¶ Don't leave me here ¶

747
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:56,919
¶ Please, turn around. ¶
