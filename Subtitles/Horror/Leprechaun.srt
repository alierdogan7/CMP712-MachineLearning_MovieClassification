(IRISH ACCENT) A limousine?

10
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,378
What in the world has
gotten into you, Mr. O'Grady?

(IRISH ACCENT) Just the start,
my dear. Just the start.

Take the last look at this dump.

13
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,891
Tomorrow we'll be
looking at mansions.

14
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:25,061
Mansions? Will you
listen to yourself?

15
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,899
And a limousine?
We've got no money for this.

16
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,119
Right inside.

17
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,616
Did the funeral parlor
deliver the package?

18
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,577
Aye. 'Tis on the porch
where they left it.

19
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,913
I don't want to touch it.

20
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,667
Will you tell me what's going
on here, Daniel O'Grady?

Ma'am.

26
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,068
What's going on here is we're rich.

27
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,983
You were supposed
to bury your mother,

28
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,363
not send her ashes all
the way from Ireland.

29
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,874
- What are you going to do?
- It's not me mother's ashes.

30
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,045

A wee person, a leprechaun.

00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,056
I caught him and made him
show me where his gold is.

make you a pot of nice hot tea.

Wait. Okay. Okay. That's good.

176
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,627
Okay, hi. I'd like to
make a reservation.

177
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,630
Yes. I'd like it to be a really tall
room, and I want it to be very...

178
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,007
- Ow! Oh!
- Great!

179
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,134
- Who are you?
- Uh...

180
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,388
I was a guy carrying
some paint thinner.

181
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,390
Oh, G... Okay.

182
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,350
Here. Does that cover?

183
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,227
Wait. Hold on a second.

184
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,312
You knock over my can
of paint thinner,

185
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,273
and then you offer me 20 bucks?

186
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,859
Okay. Okay.

187
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,570
How about that? Will that do it?

188
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,239
Uh, no.

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,994
But maybe if you said you were
sorry, you know, it might.

190
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,663
Okay. Here. Look, keep the change.
I'm in a really big hurry.

191
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,582
There's a big, ugly, disgusting house
I'd just like to distance myself from.

192
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,543
What, you mean this house here?
The O'Grady place?

193
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,462
Yeah, that place. It's really gross.
There's bugs. There's cobwebs.

194
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,881
God only knows what else is in there.

- (LAUGHING)
- What's so funny?

196
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,846
Well, I just think it's
funny the way girls

197
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,931
are always afraid of spiders
and stuff, you know?

198
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, wait a minute.

199
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,355
Did I misplace my 1950s
calendar here? Girls?

200
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,275
Listen, Bud. Okay, this is the '90s.

Women are treated equal.

202
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,072
Well, first off, my name
isn't Bud, it's Nathan.

203
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,076
And I don't know many guys
that are afraid of houses.

204
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,537
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,039
Well, you know what? Neither am I.

206
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,708
I'm not afraid of anything.

207
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,084
- Okay.
- Right.

208
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,545
- Tory? Honey?
- Yeah?

209
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,921
- What?
- Let's go.

210
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,590
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

211
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,885
I'm not gonna fight you anymore.
The house. You hate the house.

212
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,137
- No...
- It's dirty, it's dusty.

213
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,099
You really think I'm afraid of
a little dust and some bugs?

214
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,768
Come on. Just put
the bags back, okay?

215
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,988
I want to stay.

216
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,941
Dad, would you put the bags back?

217
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,036

It came right down out of the sky.

There it was,

222

this flying saucer.

223
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,551

lights, you know?

224
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,803
And making all these weird noises.

Ozzie, I thought you weren't
gonna tell any more stories.

This really happened, Alex. It did.

00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,778
Like, um...

230
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,240
Well, when you see
a star in the night sky...

231
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,784
the first star...
you can make a wish.

232
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,621
- It'll come true.
- Stop with the magic stuff.

- Hi.

ever drink that stuff!

Oh, geez, I'm sorry. You all right?

251
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,635
I was on that shelf, looking for tarps.
I didn't know you were down here.

252
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,346
I was just trying to
make a peace offering,

253
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,307
but I think it's all in that crate.

Yeah, Dan O'Grady.
He used to own this place.

345
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,578
I mean, he had buckles on his shoes,

346
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,748
and he had them real horrible teeth,

347
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,584
and they were all rotten and
everything, and... and, uh...

348
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,089
Oh, I... I know he
never does brush 'em.

- Th-That's him.

350
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,354
He's gonna kill every one
of us, and I'm first.

351
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,156
- Ozzie, come here.
- I ain't goin' in that dark corner.

He was bigger than that.

360
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,529
All right, all right. I think
we've solved this mystery now.

361

- So what, Ozzie?

363

- It's just a rainbow.
- It's a magic rainbow.

364

It's a sign.

It's time to get back to painting.

- No, no, no. No.

367

what's at the end.

370

the end of the rainbow.

- NATHAN: Ozzie.

372

373
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,578

and get him back on the job.

374

375
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,084
Oh, come on. Let 'em
go chase rainbows.

376
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,836

377

378

find the end of the rainbow!

Uh-oh.

380
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,518
It's where the rainbow ends.

381
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,436

look like where it ends.

382
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,565
OZZIE: Hey, look. It's going away.

383
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,156
Don't cut yourself on any
of this rusty old metal.

384
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,287
If you do, it'll make
your jaw lock shut.

385
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,746
This is neat. Hey,
Ozzie, I got an idea.

386

- Let's hotwire this.

would be any good.

was talking about.

You just bite on it.

from swallowing gold?

Yeah, after I kill you!

00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,157
Now, you just let me
take charge, okay?

414
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,909
I'm just gonna keep one,

415
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,120
and then I can get it checked out
in town and see if it's real or not.

416
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,457
We're gonna hide the rest.
We can't tell anyone about this.

Right, right. Why?

418
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:18,172
'Cause you know how adults are,
especially when it comes to money.

419
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,675
They'll just try to take it away.

420

know what this means?

We're rich, and... and I
can buy comics every week.

424

- Yeah, but you know what else?
- What else?

425
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,362
We can get you an operation.

426

- For what?
- To make you smart.

427
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,075

428
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,536
and have them operate
and fix your brain.

429

430

Yeah, well, sort of.

431
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,254
What I mean is,
we could make you real smart.

432

make fun of you.

- That's not the point.

857
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:24,703
Yes. Hello. This is Tory Reding.
I'm calling from the O'Grady farm.

858
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,123
Um, something really
terrible has happened,

859
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,750
and we need you to send
someone out here right away.

860
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,963
Okay. Please hurry.
You've got... Hello?

861
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,674
Damn it! Okay. The battery died.

862
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,968
- Oh, no!
- TORY: It's okay.

863
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,846
I got through, and they're
gonna send somebody,

864
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,806
and we're gonna be okay.

865
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:45,891
It's gonna be fine.

866
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,862
Deputy Tripet, come in.
This is Sheriff Cronin.

867
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,151
Tripet, do you read me?

868
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,403

I read you, Sheriff. Yeah, go ahead.</i>

869
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,655
Yeah, yeah, this is Sheriff Cronin.

870
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:05,244
We got a... a call from over
there at the O'Grady farm.

871
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,914
A female, name of Tory Reding,
called in an emergency.

872
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,042
Get out there on a code-one
priority right away.

873
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,628
TRIPET'S VOICE: Roger, Sheriff.

874
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,090
My ETA is less than three minutes.

875
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,635
- If I need backup, I'll call it in.
- SHERIFF: Roger, Tripet.

876
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,387
You got the back door, right?

877
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,639
Right. And the basement
windows are locked up tight.

878
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,893
All right. Now double-check
the windows in the kitchen.

879
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,938
Oh, my ear sure hurts, Tory.

880
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,066
I bet that leprechaun
made a boot out of it.

881
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,861
You're gonna be okay, Ozzie.
He didn't get your ear.

882
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:42,114
- He just bit it.
- Where the hell are the police?

883
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,825
Well, they should be here by now.

884
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,543
Okay.

885
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,290
All right. Now, I'm gonna have to
make this a little tighter, okay?

No, it's all right. It's all right.

It is not a leprechaun, damn it!

890
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,470
Ozzie, now, I admit I don't know
what the hell that thing was,

891
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,805
but it is not a leprechaun.

We were gonna save it to get
Ozzie an operation to fix his brain.

901
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:41,049
Alex, you can't fix Ozzie's brain.

902

Okay. Okay. Tell me about the gold.

Okay. In the water bucket, right?

905
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,601
Right. Just pull it up,
and there's a bag of gold coins.

906

Okay. This has gotta work.

907

he's gotta leave us alone.
