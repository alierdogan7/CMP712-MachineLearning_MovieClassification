00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,498
(Wind Whistling )

2
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,236
( birds calling )

3
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,911
( door creaks )

4
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,021
Hey, he's right here.

5
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,223
Woman:
I've only read about it.

6
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,526
I knoW it's extremely rare.

7
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,594
So he can't feel

8
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,659
or touch?

9
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,730
No, he responds
to normal touch and pressure.

10
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,607
His body just can't recognize
sensations of pain.

11
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,738
ClPA is a very
dangerous condition.

12
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,715
He could bite his oWn tongue off
and not even realize it.

13
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,776
He could break a bone
and keep on playing.

14
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,846
Even hot foods have to be checked
before he eats them.

15
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,049
Of course.

16
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,529
He has to be checked hourly
for cuts and bruises,

17
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,134
and not just his arms and legs,
but his Whole body,

18
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,803
even inside his mouth.

19
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,972
This is very important.

20
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,881
Martin can't tell
When something hurts.

21
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,907
Hi there.

22
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,614
I bought this neW bike
for my nepheW's birthday,

23
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,885
but he doesn't like the color.

24
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,016
Can you believe that?

25
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,152
I Was gonna just throW it out

26
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,321
When I saW you and I thought,

27
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,797
"There's a kid Who'd probably love
a neW bike."

28
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,198
Am I right?

29
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,102
It's right in my truck.
Want to take a look?

30
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,175
Do you like red?

31
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,113
It's difficult and exhausting.

32
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,617
I've been through
tWo aides already.

33
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,676
You don't have to Worry,
Mrs. Bristol.

34
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Whatever you need, I'm here.

35
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,717
Would you like to meet him noW?

36
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,592
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

37
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,299
Mrs. Bristol:
Oh God.

38
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,831
Martin!

39
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,102
Martin!

40
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,138
( distant dog barking )

41
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,855
( rain pattering )

42
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,125
( thunder crashing )

43
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,561
( man grunting )

44
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,421
( Woman sobbing )

45
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,896
Don't be afraid.

46
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,807
It doesn't have any feelings.

47
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,907
( Woman gasps, sobbing )

48
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,087
It doesn't hurt, see?

49
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,587
( Woman screams )

50
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,565

51
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,647
( continues screaming )
No!

52
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,485
It'll be over soon.

53
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,853
( Woman screaming )

54
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,866

58
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,909
( music playing on radio )

59
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,425
It's good to see you.

60
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,763

00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,042

63
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,848
You Were about that big.

65
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,912
Not really.

00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,657

HoW long do I have to

74
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,074
Well, just until your father finishes
remodeling the den.

75
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,839
I'll be in college.

76
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,174
They're here!

77
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,343

Hi.

80
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,929

00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,896

187
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,464
Then get on.

188
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,575
What's your name?

189
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,174
- Allison.
- William.

190
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,945
SloW doWn.

191
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,112
I've never been on one
of these things before.

192
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,611
After my accident the doctor said
I'd never ride again.

193
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,850
I'm kidding.

194
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,188
So Where are you from?

195
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,391
Chicago.

196
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,662
I was there once.

197
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,135
What brings you to this armpit?

198
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,638
I came to live With my uncle.

199
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,306
A problem With the parents?

200
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,368
Family issues?

201
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,778
Yeah.

202
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,907
You too, huh?

203
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,350
What kind of problems?

204
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,919
They're dead.

205
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,423
Shit, I'm sorry.

206
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,519
Yeah.

207
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,553
Me too.

208
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,773
Thanks for the ride.

209
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,679
Keep it.

210
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,812
You need it.

211
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,705
Man on radio: Still no leads
in the disappearance

212
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,730
of college student Melissa Barnes
Who Was last seen

213
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:25,368
Ieaving her place of employment
at the Charcoal Diner...

214
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,742
Hey, hoW Was your run?

215
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,804
Interesting.

216
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,908
( thunder rumbling, crashing )

217
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,765
Woman:
Melissa, l-- I think

218
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,131
my hand is coming loose.

219
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,294
( door opens )

220
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,900
He's coming.
Don't make a sound.

221
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,468
We're gonna get out of here.

222
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,053
Man: When steer are led
to slaughter,

223
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,720
they smell the stench
of fear and blood

224
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,627
and they panic.

225
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,628
Sometimes We'd have to saW off
their hind legs

226
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,696
so they couldn't run.

227
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,675
No.

228
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,740
No, please.

229
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,585
Woman: No.

230
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,249
No. Oh God!

231
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,521
- ( knife tears flesh )
- ( Woman screaming )

232
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,960
Man:
Hold her still.

233
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,987
( Woman continues screaming )

234
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,591
Man:
Get back here.

235
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,034
( Woman continues screaming )

236
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,270
( panting )

237
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,208
It's okay.

238
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,378
Everything's under control.

239
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,617
Looks like I got here
just in time.

240
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,695
( screaming )

241
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,271
When something outlasts
its usefulness,

242
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,672
it gets discarded.

243
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,680
( lock clicks )

244
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,654
( thunder crashing )

245
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,438
( hissing )

246
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,727
Still here?

247
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,201
( distant train horn blaring )

248
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,712
- See you later.
- Yeah.

249
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,409
- Bye.
- Bye.

250
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,314
( clicks tongue )

251
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,319
Are you sure you're all right?

252
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,220
Yeah, gotta get it over With
sooner or later.

253
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,588
She'll be fine.

254
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,035
Nervous?

255
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,130
You think they'll have
a decent track team?

256
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,336
Don't get your hopes up.

257
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,139
No chance of that.

258
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,279
What is that place?

259
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,122
That's the Sutter plant.
It's been closed for years.

260
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,788
I saW someone there yesterday
While I Was jogging--

261
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,694
a boy.

262
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,596
A boy?

263
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,533
Yeah, I thought so.

264
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,900
Probably just some kids
vandalizing the place.

265
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,598
I kind of Wish
you'd stay aWay from there

266
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,301
and jog on the main road.

267
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,333
Yeah, and get hit by a truck.

268
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,141
Graham's a pack rat.
That place should be condemned.

269
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,171
Someone lives there?

270
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,206
Yeah, he stays mostly
to himself.

271
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,343
You knoW him?

272
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,684
We're about the same age.

273
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,350
He never went to school.

274
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,417
His dad made him Work at that place
day and night.

275
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:14,057
It was a meat-packing plant

276
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,762
till they couldn't afford
to upgrade the equipment to code.

277
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,306
I'll tell you one thing:
I don't miss the smell.

278
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,177
I'll pick you up at 2:30.

279
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:14,051
Silence is a sound

280
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,925
of no fear...

281
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,459
no pain...

282
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,694
the sound of peace.

283
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,604
( grunts )

284
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,796
I envy your serenity.

285
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,432
The path to redemption

286
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,639
begins With forgiveness--

287
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,113
absolution.

288
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,582
You're my Witness.

289
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,183
What did I tell you?

290
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,213
I told you don't touch,
didn't l?

291
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,561
William:
Yeah, the bolts are stripped.

292
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,962
Cashier:
$17.50.

293
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,703
- Can I oWe you the 50 cents?
- Yeah, right.

294
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,295
William:
Thanks, Eddie.

295
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,442
Jonathan, hoW's that
extension coming?

296
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,179
It's going really good.

297
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,709
( engine starts )

298
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,552
You knoW you've got
dryWall nails here?

299
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,784
Hmm?

300
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,884
Oh shit.

301
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,021
Just cheerleading.
Unless you can kick a field goal.

302
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,587
That's it?

303
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,657
There isn't much of a demand
for girls' sports in this area.

304
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,295
Our cheerleading squad
did Win Best Routine

305
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,669
in the state final last year.

306
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,173
( sighs )

307
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,009
( girls cheering )

308
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,742
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

309
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,012
Yeah!

310
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,746
Girl: Ready?

311
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,483
( girls chanting )
Let's shake it. Let's shout it.

312
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,753
PHS!

313
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,454
Let's shake it.
Let's shout it.

314
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,758
PHS!

315
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,197
Let's shake it.
Let's shout it.

316
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,829
Aren't you scared of that falling
and crushing you?

317
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,169
HoW's your leg?

318
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,579
Oh, it's better.

319
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,518
So this is What you do--

320
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,886
fix cars?

321
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,118
Guidance counselor told me
my aptitude tests said

322
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,925
either medical school
or auto mechanic.

323
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,329
I can't stand the sight of blood, so...

324
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,060
Okay, Well,
I don't Want to bother you, so...

325
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,501
Hey.

326
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,508
Yeah?

327
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,641
Are you busy later?

328
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,447
Um, I Was gonna go home
and stare at the ceiling

329
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,977
until I fell asleep. Why?

330
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,717
Well, I Was--

331
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,884
I Was Wondering if maybe
you Wanted to--

332
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,225
Man: Billy!

333
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,822
Excuse me.

334
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,191
- Billy!
- Dad?

335
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,465
In here.

336
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,870
- Christ.
- God.

337
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,103
I dropped the fucking remote.

338
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,576
be careful.

339
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,442
- OW, Jesus!
- Sorry, Dad.

340
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,311
- Oh man.
- You're dead Weight.

341
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,714
Yeah, Well, I'm not dead yet.

342
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,185
- Oh.
- Can I help?

343
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,848
- Father: Just-- just lift me up.
- Yeah, just hold his chair.

344
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,720
- Okay.
- Come on, just put me back on my chair.

345
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,124
( grunts )
You got it.

346
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,358
- Allison: Here.
- ( both men grunt )

347
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,559
- Allison: Okay.
- You could have hurt yourself.

348
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,591
What do you mean,
could have?

349
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,399
( groans )

350
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,269
- Thank you.

351
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,503

00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,673
- Allison: Hi.

354
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,942
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,609
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

356
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,982
I hate Chicago.

357
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,455
- Hey, at least you're not gay, right?
- Dad.

358
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,585
You knoW, he spends most of the time
alone in his room,

359
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,927
- doing Who knoWs What.
- Yeah, you should talk.

360
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,955
Yeah, but it's about the only thing
I've got left.

361
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,264
Um, I should probably go.

362
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,860
William:
No, stay.

363
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,633
No, it's getting late.
I really have to get home.

364
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,663
William:
He's not normally like this.

365
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,698
He's usually much Worse.

366
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,610
Well, maybe you should give him
the helmet.

367
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,011
Bye.

368
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,107
( door opens, closes )

369
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,448
What the hell
is the matter With you?

370
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,386
Can't she take a joke?

371
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,786
Hey, come on.

372
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,087
Hey, toss me my cigarettes.

373
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,291
Hey, What--?
NoW What am I supposed to do?

374
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,915
( scrubbing )

375
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,248
What's your name?

376
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,555
Hello?

377
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,588
Can you ansWer me, please?

378
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,334
Graham:
If they have no feelings,

379
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,804
they can't knoW fear.

380
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,573
But if they can't knoW fear...

381
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,377
Why do they run?

382
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,046
Let me go.

383
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,216
All clean?

384
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,183
Come here.

385
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,803
What are you doing?

386
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,445
Give me your arm.

387
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,391
Don't.

388
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,951
Run!

389
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,156
He doesn't understand.
Can't you see?

390
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,598
Stop it. Stop it!

391
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,861
His conscience is unburdened.

392
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,533
You're crazy!

393
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,565
Is yours?

394
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,010
Let me go!
You're fucking crazy!

395
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,479
Let me go!

396
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,943
Oh God.

397
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,190
Where Were you?

398
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,134
Um, I'm sorry.

399
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,000
You're sorry?

400
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,869
Jonathan.

401
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,567
I thought We said 2:30.

402
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,007
I left early.

403
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,943
We Were beginning to Worry.

404
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,640
Well, I said I'm sorry.

405
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,309
Let's not make it a habit.

406
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,477
- Okay?
- Okay.

407
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,054
You've been to Paris?

408
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,488
Yeah, a feW times.

409
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,788
WoW, you've been to so many
cool places.

410
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,920
Yeah, my dad used to turn
all of his business trips

411
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,329
into family vacations.

412
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,198
He Was great like that.

413
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,066
I've never been anyWhere.

414
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,470
Well, maybe someday you can go
to Chicago With me.

415
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,533
- Tomorrow?
- No.

416
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:33,873
( knocks on door )

417
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,840
Hi guys. Wendy.

418
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,077
Can I borroW your camera?

419
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,108
Yeah, there's a feW
more pictures left.

420
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,417
You can finish the roll
if you Want.

421
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,185
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- Dad, can We go to France?

422
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,215
Sure. I'll cash in
some stock options.

423
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,750
See What I mean?

424
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,229
HoW about Pittsburgh, huh?

425
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,563
Wendy: HoW much longer
do I have to give up my room?

426
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,261
Jonathan:
Not much longer.

427
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,465
Wendy: Don't you think
Whiskers needs a bigger cage?

428
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,769
Jonathan:
I think that cage is just fine.

429
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,038
Do you think
Allison's happy here?

430
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,045
I hope so.

431
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,207
I don't think she likes me.

432
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,411
HoW could somebody
not like you?

433
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,716
- I knoW, right?
- Right.

434
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,244
( chuckles )

435
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,280
You knoW, I'm-- l-- l--

436
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,315
I'm feeling--
feeling something.

437
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,295
I'm feeling a little--
I'm feeling a little hungry.

438
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,523
( Wendy giggling )
Oh no.

439
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,727
- I need a pilloW sandWich.
- ( squeals, giggling )

440
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,327
( imitates cheWing )

441
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,408
Hello.

442
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,385
Can you talk?

443
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,357
I can help you.

444
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,193
You've just got to help me
get loose first.

445
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,700
Please.

446
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,434
Help me.

447
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,707
I've done everything
you've asked me.

448
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,712
You could make it stop.

449
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,293
( heart beating )

450
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,352
( Whimpering )

451
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,180
( screams )

452
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,713
God damn it!

453
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,134
( Whimpering )

454
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,335
( screaming )

455
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,156
( Melissa screaming )

456
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,541
( flesh rips )

457
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,726
( continues screaming )

458
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,183
( continues screaming )

459
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,879
NoW they can't trust you.

460
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,876
You're gonna have to
make it up to them somehoW.

461
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,719
They take advantage

462
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,850
of vulnerability
and Weakness.

463
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,019
Bury it.

464
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,003
The furnace needs scrubbing.

465
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,391
Graham:
You caused all this.

466
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,141
Be good, sWeetie.

467
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,842
I will.

468
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,223
Whiskers, no.

469
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,995
Theories on our
emotional development

470
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,293
are divided into
tWo schools of thought--

471
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,596
Whether We're products
of genetics

472
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,398
predisposed to exhibit
certain behavioral patterns,

473
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,302
or products
of our environment.

474
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,967
Evolutionary biologists believe

475
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,999
that our inherited genes

476
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,307
are What determine
development.

477
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,213
Opponents argue
that our individuality

478
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,184
is directly influenced
by the patterns of behavior

479
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,210
that We see and hear
every day.

480
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,246
In other Words,

481
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,281
a child raised
in a loving environment

482
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,419
Will respond to the World
in a much different Way

483
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,522
than a child raised in fear
or taught to hate.

484
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:45,399
Our children are in essence
mirror images of ourselves--

485
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,995
our beliefs, our ideologies,

486
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,438
our conscience--

487
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,272
ground control to Major Tom--

488
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,301
Which brings us
to psychotherapy--

489
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,405
the psychoanalytic theory
of personality.

490
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:01,008
This Will be on the test, people.

491
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,357
Hey, need a ride?

492
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,884
Uh, I don't knoW.

493
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,328
Come on, get in.

494
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,832
Take a break.
Have some fun.

495
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,634
Are you starting
your oWn pharmacy?

496
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,732
I get headaches.

497
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,538
I can't stay out late.

498
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,341
Don't Worry.
I'll have you back by Monday.

499
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,541
Yeah, I restored it piece by piece.

500
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,176
I thought about opening my oWn
body shop one day, but...

501
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,652
Why don't you?

502
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,316
Um, Well, my dad--
he's not so good on his oWn.

503
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,952
So hoW far do you run anyWay?

504
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,293
Five, six miles.

505
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,855
I would have a heart attack.

506
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,992
Yeah.

507
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,934
These Will give you
a heart attack.

508
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,262
I guess you never eat
junk like this, huh?

509
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,003
I'm not in training right noW.

510
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,840
Yeah, me neither.

511
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,306
( insects chirping )

512
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,851
( engine starts )

513
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,929
So do you have any
brothers or sisters?

514
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,333
Just me and my dad.

515
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,428
My mom died
a couple of years ago--

516
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,701
pneumonia.

517
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,140
Has he alWays been, um--?

518
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,667
Yeah, he used to Work
construction.

519
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:12,045
He lost the use of his legs
in an accident

520
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,516
in Chicago, actually.

521
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,516
My father alWays Wanted a boy.

522
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,959
He was a track star

523
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:30,865
and just missed qualifying
for the Olympics in '76.

524
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:34,860
He tried to correct
that failure through me.

525
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,598
They Were driving home
from dinner

526
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,441
just a mile from the house and...

527
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,876
an SUV bleW a stop sign.

528
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,449
It's funny

529
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,153
hoW everything can change
in an instant.

530
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,185
A stranger can come along

531
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:03,529
and in the blink of an eye just

532
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,025
destroy everything.

533
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,039
So you came to live
With your uncle?

534
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,569
I have a grandmother

535
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:19,810
Who lives in NeW York,
but she's agoraphobic,

536
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,318
a real freak shoW, so...

537
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,752
it Was her or my uncle.

538
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,758
I bet you Wish
you Went to NeW York noW, huh?

539
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,020
I hate New York.

540
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,074
( truck approaching )

541
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,747
Out of the car, Allison.

542
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,816
- What?
- You heard me.

543
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,125
- I'm not going anyWhere.
- Yeah, back off, man.

544
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,825
You shut your mouth!
Come on.

545
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,302
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking you home.

546
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,530
Allison

547
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,832
Your mother and father Worked hard
so you could be somebody.

548
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:56,312
I'm not gonna let you derail that
by hanging out With that trailer trash.

549
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,337
You don't even knoW him.

550
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,316
I knoW that kid better than you
ever Will. If your father Was here--

551
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,785
Look, sports, college--
that Whole thing--

552
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,879
that Was my father's dream,
not mine.

553
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,913
I never Wanted any of it.

554
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,426
Well, What do you Want? Do you Want
to live in the back of a truck?

555
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,984
Do you Want to collect Welfare?

556
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,019
You think
I Wanted to come here?

557
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,124
You think I Wanted
to come and live With you?

558
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,174
My brother and l
made a promise

559
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,610
a long time ago:

560
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,581
Should something happen
to either of us,

561
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,948
We'd be there
for each other's kids.

562
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:41,146
It's not one you ever expect
to have to keep,

563
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,718
and I'm not going back
on my Word,

564
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,730
but it's your life.

565
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,062
You Want to try it out
on your oWn,

566
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,432
go ahead.

567
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,228
You Want me to get out?

568
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,798
I Want you to make a choice.

569
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,908
Okay, Well, We'll do things
my Way for a While,

570
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:13,582
just as long as We understand
each other.

571
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,648
( sniffling )

572
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,969
( door squeaks )

573
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,220
( sobbing )

574
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:02,196
Woman: Oh no.

575
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,173
No.

576
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,914
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

577
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,013
Please.

578
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,490
Graham:
Like I shoWed you.

579
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,255
Woman:
Why are you doing this?

580
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,355
HoW frightening
When it's our oWn flesh.

581
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,798
Woman: No!

582
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,392
No, stop.

583
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,800
Graham:
Hold her still.

584
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,431
Woman: No.

585
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,236
- Graham: Do it!
- Please, please.

586
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,442
- I don't think your heart's in this.
- No. No.

587
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,571
( screaming )

588
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,012
( Woman continues screaming )

589
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:01,928
( Martin gasping, coughing )

590
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,706
Come on.
Come on.

591
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,142
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

592
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,578
This is my house.

593
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,014
I'm not gonna be like you--
condemned.

594
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,610
I'm fixing What you broke!

595
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,587
Go back to hell
Where your bed is made.

596
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,318
This is my house!

597
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,466
( panting )

598
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,820
( panting )

599
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,263
( hammer pounding )

600
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,671
- My dad trusted me.
- Jonathan Will too.

601
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,044
You just have to
give him a chance.

602
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,413
Besides, it's not you
he doesn't trust.

603
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,179
I can take care of myself.

604
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,050
I knoW you can.

605
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,248
He's just trying
to look out for you.

606
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,416
Please.

607
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,953
( sighs )

608
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,289
What's he got
against William anyWay?

609
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:47,064
Oh, We've knoWn Billy
since he Was this high.

610
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,470
He's had to deal With more
than his share of problems.

611
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,498
That's not his fault.

612
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,773
I mean, I think it's Wonderful
hoW he takes care of his father,

613
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:59,043
especially after What happened
to his mother.

614
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,347
Well, she did that to herself.

615
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,717
You can't give yourself
pneumonia.

616
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,721
She didn't die of pneumonia.

617
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:13,354
Billy's mother--
she killed herself.

618
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,092
What?

619
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:19,761
Hung herself in the garage.

620
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:27,067
Billy Was the one
Who found her.

621
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,977
It Was really hard on him.

622
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,982
The doctors put him
on all sorts of medication.

623
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,315
He's gotten in a lot of trouble
around toWn.

624
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,617
I think Jonathan's just afraid
he's a little unstable.

625
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,318
And hisfather--well--

626
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:43,848
Where are you going?

627
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,020
I need to sort things out
in my head.

628
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,022
Hey, Allison,
you Want to play a game?

629
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,057
Maybe later, okay?

630
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,569
Where are you going?

631
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,667
Hello?

632
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,407
No, Wait.

633
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,897
( flies buzzing )

634
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,686
Hello?

635
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,484
Hey, are you okay?

636
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,510
Wait.

637
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,372
Are you okay?

638
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,677
Are you in trouble?

639
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:15,961
What are you doing doWn here?

640
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,913
Are you in here?

641
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,937
( quietly )
Oh my God.

642
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,417
Martin.

643
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,302
( rattling )

644
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,029
Where are you?

645
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,934
( Allison gasps )

646
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,372
Wait. Come back.

647
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,254
I'm not going to hurt you.

648
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,917
I want to help you.

649
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,590
Is your name Martin?

650
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,261
Here, come With me.

651
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,896
You can't stay here.
It's not safe.

652
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,099
What's Wrong?

653
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,234
You don't have to be afraid.

654
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,268
You can trust me.

655
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,177
You shouldn't be doWn here.

656
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:49,275
( Allison screaming )
No! No!

657
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,412
No! No! No!

658
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,822
( panting )

659
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,963
Good Work.

660
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:14,206
- I'm sure she's fine.
- How?

661
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,643
She's just bloWing off
some steam.

662
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,409
No 17-year-old Wants to be told
What to do.

663
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,045
Not yet.

664
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:29,251
I don't have any brothers or sisters
'cause Dad's lazy.

665
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,227
And noW he's
chased her aWay too.

666
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,229
Way to go, Dad.

667
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,080
( rat squeaking )

668
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,014
( screaming )

669
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,787
( screaming continues )

670
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,843
( distant train horn bloWing )

671
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,545
She never came home
last night.

672
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:35,523
I know.

673
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,718
Where are you going?

674
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,592
I'm gonna go find her.

675
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,396
I need to speak to Allison.

676
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,800
She's not here.

677
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,032
It's important.

678
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:53,064
- She isn't here, Billy.
- We thought she Was With you.

679
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,509
No. She's been gone all night?

680
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,034
Since yesterday.

681
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,013
This is your goddamn fault.

682
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,017
- Stop. Jonathan.
- Stay the hell aWay from her.

683
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,211
- Jonathan.
- Don't push me.

684
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,482
- Jonathan.
- You're no good.

685
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,386
You're just like your old man--

686
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,152
good for nothing.

687
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,751
It's okay.

688
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:14,422
Stay aWay from my niece!

689
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,897
Come on.
Are you all right?

690
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,300
( Allison Whimpering )

691
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,983
Please.

692
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,886
If they have no feelings,

693
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,356
they can't knoW fear.

694
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,191
But if they can't knoW fear...

695
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,596
( Allison panting )

696
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,032
then Why do they run?

697
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,481
Anybody home?

698
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,913
Please don't.

699
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,429
Sutter!

700
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,795
Uncle J!

701
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:35,098
( Whimpering )

702
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,080
( knocks )

703
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,612
( muffled screaming )

704
01:09:57,626 --> 01:10:00,254
Hello?

705
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,025
( knocking )

706
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,897
( muffled screams )

707
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,039
Who's there?

708
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,169
It's Jonathan Miller.

709
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,111
I'm looking for my niece.

710
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,671
She didn't come home
last night.

711
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,808
I've been looking
all over for her.

712
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,250
I thought she might have Wandered
over here. Have you seen her?

713
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,049
No.

714
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:32,727
Listen, do you have a young boy
living over here?

715
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,696
She said she saW a boy
running around over here.

716
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,665
Just get off my property.

717
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,225
You mind if I come in
a moment?

718
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,532
I'm busy.

719
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,562
Just a moment.

720
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:47,803
Just a second.

721
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,469
Uncle J!

722
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:53,572
Allison?

723

Uncle J!

724
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,503
What did you do?

725
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,038
You girls, you--

726
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,847
you never can keep
your mouths shut.

727
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,150
( screaming )

728
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,583
No! No!

729
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:42,393
( continues screaming )
No. No.

730
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,899

Can she--?
Allison.

757
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:56,778
I can't hear you.

758
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:59,343
William, open the door.

759
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,050

760
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,291

Forget it.

772
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,122
Leave me alone.

773
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,973
I don't care.

774
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,341
Let them find out.

775
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,368
Forget it.

776
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:32,896
I won't do it.

777
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,341
I can't.

778
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:43,080
You leave him alone.

779
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,678
He hasn't done anything.

780
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,319
No. No, I need him.

781
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:52,417
Who-- Who-- Who's gonna
help me clean up?

782
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,560
You knoW I can't stand it.

783
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:59,396
No no no

784
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,835
Shut up. Shut up!

785
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,668
God!

786
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,571
You're no better than he Was!

787
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,203
You promised me.

788
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,679
I did everything you said.

789
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:51,615
( screams )

790
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,644
( sobbing )

791
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,033
You Win.

792
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,016
You're Wrong.

793
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:26,350
He wouldn't dare.

794
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,352
Don't look at me like that.

795
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,218
You don't ask Why.

796
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,952
You just do.

797
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,290
That's just the Way it is.

798
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:12,694
You think you oWe me,

799
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:16,795
think maybe I should groW eyes
in the back of my head?

800
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:19,466
They abandoned you.

801
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,210
What Would you be
Without me?

802
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,973
You feel guilty or something?

803
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:32,475
Don't feel guilty.

804
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,512
A child shouldn't feel guilty
about nothing.

805
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,067
You--

806
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:50,435
you don't feel anything, do you--

807
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:53,134
guilt, pain, regret--

808
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:57,270
nothing? Do you?

809
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:00,577
Who are you to judge me?

810
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:16,628
You have no soul to redeem.

811
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,859
Do you?

812
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:32,377
Don't try anything funny
While I'm gone.

813
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,814
They're Watching.

814
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:57,755
( grunting )

815
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:19,176
( panting )

816
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,039
Oh my God.

817
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,143
What did he do to you?

818
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:53,848
Come on. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

819
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,219
I'm sorry.

820
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,429
Are you okay?

821
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,798
Come on.

822
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:19,545
Come on. It's okay.
Trust me, okay?

823
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,385
Come on, I can't carry you.

824
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,761
Is this What you're scared of?

825
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,429
This thing?

826
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:46,339
You see? It's nothing.

827
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,444
When are they coming home?

828
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:01,978
Soon.

829
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,865
( panting, grunting )

830
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,863
( knocks on door )

831
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,390
Finally.

832
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,812
Yes?

833
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:06,480

- Wendy, run.

834
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:09,319
Mommy!
( screaming )

835
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:13,788
Mommy.

836
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:22,428
- Mommy!
- Wendy, run.

837
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,698
Run!

838
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:35,809
No, please don't.

839
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,477
I have to.

840
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,543
( screaming )

841
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,694
We're almost there, okay?

Jonathan.

844
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:40,036
No.

845
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:54,885
It's gonna be okay.

846
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,521
Okay?

847
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:58,464
I'm gonna get you home.

848
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:00,524

850
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,512
Randy. Oh Randy.

( screams )

855
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:46,841
Please don't hurt my animals.

856

01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:19,075
and trusted me

859
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:21,673
even at the end.

860
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:26,217
Unconditional.

861
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:29,121
And he--he made me!

862
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,385
Mommy!

863
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:41,193
I'm making things right.

864
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:43,703
I owe them that much.

865
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,004
With each one

866
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:51,170
another sin is forgiven.

867
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:54,704
I can't let it happen again,

868
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,239
not like me.

869
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:06,890
You understand, don't you?

870
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:10,364
Not like that boy-- Worthless.

01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:26,746
Don't let him get her.

875
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:34,381
I can't stop now.

876
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,982
There's still
so much more to do.

877

It's me.
It's just me, okay?

889
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,727
