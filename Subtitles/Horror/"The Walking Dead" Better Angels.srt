Isn't there anybody else
who's gonna stand with me?

6
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:20,021
- This is a young man's life!
- Do it.

7
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:22,274
Take him away.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,388
Do something!

9
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:28,795
Sorry, brother.

10

Rick's voice: <i>Dale could--
could get under your skin.</i>

11
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:53,570
<i>He sure got under mine,</i>

12
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:56,473
because he wasn't afraid <i>to
say exactly what he thought,</i>

13

<i>how he felt.</i>

14
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,916
That kind of honesty is rare

15

<i>Whenever I'd make a decision,</i>

17
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:21,001
<i>I'd look at Dale.</i>

18
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,941
He'd be looking back at me
with that look he had.

19
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,914
<i>We've all seen it</i>

He knew things about us--

<i>The truth...</i>

25

<i>Who we really are.</i>

26
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:58,844
In the end, he was talking
about losing our humanity.

The best way to honor him
<i>is to unbreak it.</i>

30
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,261
Set aside our differences
and pull together,

We're not broken.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,214
We're gonna prove him wrong.

<i>From now on...</i>

38
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:42,197
<i>We're gonna do it his way.</i>

She's right.

50

We should've moved you

51

All right, let's move the
vehicles near each of the doors

52
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,960
- facing out toward the road.
- Just leave it there.

Rick: <i>We'll build a

Keep track of everyone

58
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,437
What about standing guard?

59
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,440
I need you and Daryl
on double duty.

60
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,342
Gotcha.

61
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,811
I'll stock the basement
with food and water,

62
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,148

there a few days if need be.

63

- What about patrols?
- Let's get this area locked down first.

64
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,820
After that,
Shane'll assign shifts

65
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,257
while me and Daryl take Randall
offsite and cut him loose.

66

We're back to that now?

It was the right plan
first time around.

68

Poor execution.

69
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,369

that's two separate
things, right?

74

When I'm out with Daryl,

84
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:55,496
help Hershel keep an eye
on things around here.

85
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:58,432
- Me
- Shane's got a way

86
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,167
of letting things
get out of hand,

87
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,903
especially when
he's all torqued up.

88
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,573
I think we're all a bit
torqued up at this point.

89
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,676
If you're staying here permanently,
he's got to understand

90
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:12,180
that it's what Rick and I
say, not whatever he wants.

91
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,316
- You've become close.
- We talk.

92
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:17,218
Then you know
he's not a bad guy.

93
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,386
He's just his own worst enemy.

94
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,622
You want me to babysit Shane?

95
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:24,491

you should stop leaving.

- Of course.

What you doing, wandering
around by yourself?

102

If, um--
If I tell you something,

103
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:56,388
will you promise
not to tell my parents?

And it-- it got free,
came after me and...

it, Dale would still be here.

00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,303
After Dale?

175
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,409
This is real.

176
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,679
And we can't...

177
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,615
Keep it at bay.
It's already got us.

178
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:24,756
And it just
keeps coming, doesn't it?

179
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:29,527
I made a mess of things.

180
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,931
I put you and Rick at odds.

181
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,800
I don't even know
whose baby this is.

182
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:42,407
I can't imagine
how hard that is on you.

183
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:49,781
You led us out of Atlanta
with no thought for yourself.

184
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,552
( Crying ) Do you
remember that night?

185
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:57,488
The flames, the--

186
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:00,624
And I'm sitting in our car

187
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,393
thinking "We're gonna
be all right.

188
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:06,196
He's gonna make it all right.
We'll get out of here."

189
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,800
And I never
thanked you for that.

190
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,872
Even though things got...

191
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:18,709
( Chuckles )
Confused between us,

192
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,779
you were there for me.

193
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:27,818
You were there for me.
Thank you.

194
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:35,025
You don't need
to thank me for that.

195
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,961
- Of course I do. Of course I do.
- No, you--

196
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,865
Whatever happened between us,

197
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:42,799
whatever the hell
we thought it was--

198
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,469
And not just you, but--

199
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:52,243
I'm sorry, Shane.

200
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:55,813
Please believe me.
I am <i>so</i> sorry.

201
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,765
Take him out to Senoia--
hour there, hour back,

202
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,734
give or take.
We may lose the light,

203
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:20,770
but we'll be halfway
ho by then.

204
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:23,740
This little pain in the ass
will be a distant memory.

205
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:25,375
Good riddance.

206
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:27,477
Carol's putting together
some provisions for him,

207
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:30,180
enough to last a few days.

208
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,354
That thing you did
last night--

209
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,860
Ain't no reason you should
do all the heavy lifting.

210
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:46,131
- So are you good with all this?
- <i>( Engine stops )</i>

211
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,400

<i>- I don't see you and I trading haymakers</i>

212
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,836
on the side of the road.
Nobody'd win that fight.

213
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:57,309
I'm gonna take a piss.

214
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:02,314
Hey, man, you seen Carl lately?

215
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:04,549
He's inside with his mother.

216
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:06,117
Look, he came to me.

217
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,619
Okay, I wasn't supposed
to say anything,

218
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:10,655
but he was out
in the swamps yesterday

219
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:13,992
and he came across a walker
stuck in the mud.

220
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:16,827
He got scared, ran off.

221
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,262
The same walker
that killed Dale?

222
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:22,099
That's the one.

223
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,202
- I'll have Lori talk to him.
- Look, man, I think--

224
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,271
I think he wants
to talk to his father.

225
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,374
Well, I need this Randall
thing done already.

226
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,877
Man, that needs to wait, okay?

227
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,417
It's my call.

228
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:42,855
How about
I ride out with Daryl?

229
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:44,590
Good for us to spend
a little time together.

230
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,926
Nah, I need you here.

231
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,895
Don't think
I'll handle it right, huh?

232
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:52,130
- Didn't say that.
- <i>What you say?</i>

233
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,702
You know, your son--

234
00:15:57,704 --> 00:15:59,236
He gave me this.

235
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,004
You should get that
back to Daryl, huh?

I think it's
been parked too long.

241
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,493
You gotta tap it three times...

242
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,295
And give her a twist.

He was proud of you.

Maybe not in that moment,
but overall.

257
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,947
Oh, that's easy for you to say.

258
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,449
You had his back.

259
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,618
I have my share of regrets,

260
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,054
but I think that he knew

261
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:59,556
how much we cared for him.

had nothing to do with you.

He-- he died, dad.

I got a lot going on, you know?

348
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,474
It ain't all about you.

349
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:30,609
I-- I ain't saying
it's about me.

350
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,912
Just trying to--

- Lori: What's wrong?
- Glenn: Randall's missing.

356
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:27,763
Lori:
Missing? How.

357
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,831
Hershel:
How long's he been gone?

358
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,134
- Woman: <i>What's goin' on?</i>
<i>- Hershel: It's hard to say.</i>

359
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:33,635
The cuffs are still hooked.

360
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:36,304
- He must' slipped 'em.
- Is that possible?

361
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:37,973
It is if you've got
nothing to lose.

362
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:40,276
The door was secured
from the outside.

363
00:26:57,195 --> 00:26:59,864
( Shouting )
Rick! Rick!

364
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,634
- What happened?
- He's armed!

365
00:27:03,636 --> 00:27:05,603
- He's got my gun!
- Carl: Are you okay?

366
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:08,005
I'm fine. Little bastard
just snuck up on me.

367
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,741
- He clocked me in the face.
- All right, Hershel, T-Dog,

368
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:12,109
get everybody
back in the house.

369
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:14,278
Glenn, Daryl, come with us.

370
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,448
- T, I'm gonna need that gun.
- Carol: <i>Just let him go.</i>

371
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,283
That was the plan, wasn't it,
to just let him go?

372
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:20,985
The plan was to cut him
loose far away from here,

373
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,687
not on our front step
with a gun.

374
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:24,790
Don't go out there.
Ya'll know what can happen.

375
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,726
Get everybody back
in the house.

376
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,061
<i>Lock all the doors</i>
<i>and stay put!</i>

377
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:31,197
- Let's go, back in the house.
- Okay.

378
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,536
I saw him head up through the trees
that way before I blacked out.

379
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:39,071
I'm not sure how long.

380
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,840
He couldn't have gotten far.

381
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,474
He's hobbled, exhausted.

382
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,376
- Glenn: And armed.
- Rick: So are we.

383
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:47,746
- Can you track him?
- No, I don't see nothing.

384
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:49,515
Hey, look, there ain't no
use in tracking him, okay?

385
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,083
He went that way.
We need to pair up.

386
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:53,118
We spread out, we just
chase him down. That's it.

387
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,454
Kid weighs
a buck-25 soaking wet.

388
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:57,456
You trying to tell us
he got the jump on you?

389
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,525
I say a rock pretty much
evens those odds, wouldn't you?

390
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,827
Alright, knock it off. You and Glenn
start heading up the right flank.

391
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:03,695
Me and Shane'll take the left.

392
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:07,032
Remember, Randall's not
the only threat out there.

393
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,067
Keep an eye out for each other.

394

<i>( Crickets chirping )</i>

395
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,173
Looks like
it's busted pretty bad.

396
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,010
It's fine, man.

397
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:50,980
Don't worry about me.

( Sighs )

399
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,544
This is pointless.
You got a light?

400
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:35,424
( Irritated sigh ) Come on.

401
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:19,335
Glenn: We're just
back to square one.

402
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:20,436
If you're gonna do a thing,

403
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,405
you might as well do it right.

404
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,161
There's two sets
of tracks right here.

405
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:48,263
Shane must've followed him
a lot longer than he said.

406
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,735
There's fresh blood
on this tree.

407
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,208
There's more tracks.

408
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,044

walking in tandem.

00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,915
Sorry.

411
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:14,054
Yeah, there was
a little dust up right here.

<i>- I mean something went down.</i>

413

It's getting weird.

414
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,199

Nice.

Does this way feel right?

423
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,261
As right as any.

424
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:02,834
- Snatched your gun, huh?
- Yeah.

425
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:05,837
It's my favorite piece too.

00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,971

00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:09,173
Wish he'd killed me

428
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:15,880
Go on.

429
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:39,004
He's got no bites.

430
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,206
Yeah, none you can see.

431
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:45,811
No, I'm telling you
he died from this.

you with a rock?

That's what I said.

436
00:34:21,288 --> 00:34:23,656
Inside the shed?

437
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,866
'Cause that door was shut
when T-Dog rolled up.

00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:38,472
I saw that too.

Must've slipped through
the rafters in the roof.

00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:10,036
So this is where
you planned to do it?

441
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:16,042
It's a good place as any.

442
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:18,977
At least have the balls
to call this what it is--

444
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:23,915
Murder.

You really believe if you walk
back onto that farm alone--

00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:32,525
- No me, no Randall--
- I want you to hush up.

That's just it.
It ain't no story.

They'll get over you.
