1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,720
This film contains strong language and some violent scenes. 

2
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
RUSSIAN VOICES 

3
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,440
THEY SPEAK IN RUSSIAN 

4
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,600
CAMERA CLICKS 

5
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,080
SHE SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN 

6
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600
SHE SCREAMS 

7
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,240
Alexi? 

8
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
SHOUTING OVER MONITORS 

9
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,880
SHE SCREAMS 

10
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
Captain, winds gusting at 110. If they get to 130, 

11
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,840
we're verging category five! 

12
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,760
Put her back into the wind, Woods. 

13
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,920
45 degrees down-swell. 

14
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,800
Captain, the barge is taking on water. 

15
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,080
Captain! 

16
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
I've got eyes for Christ's sake! I've seen worse, Foster. 

17
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
Stand your station. 

18
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,480
Woods! 

19
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,520
45 degrees! 

20
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,360
Green water! 

21
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
HOOTER SOUNDS 

22
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
Steve! Engine room! 

23
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
The door's jammed. I can't get in! 

24
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,040
If water stalls the engine, we're history! 

25
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,320
Hiko, take the torch and cut the door. 

26
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm going up top. 

27
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,880
Hiko, let me help you! 

28
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,240
Captain! 

29
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Recommend new course setting. 229 degrees magnetic. Captain? 

30
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,360
If we get to the eye we have calm seas for two hours! 

31
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
We can make repairs, steady the barge! 

32
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,120
Should I head for the eye? 

33
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,400
What the hell is going on?! 

34
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,760
The engine room is taking on water! 

35
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,760
Pump it out. You're the engineer! 

36
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,640
We can't get in! 

37
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,400
The bulkhead took a hit. The door's wedged! Hiko's cutting it now. 

38
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,360
Jesus Christ! The barge! 

39
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,960
We gotta cut that thing loose! 

40
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
That's not an option. 

41
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,280
Should I head for the breach? I need an answer. 

42
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,200
Wind's 125, Captain! 

43
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,080
Take a look! That barge goes down, we go down with it! 

44
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,600
Well, that's a chance I'll take. 

45
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm cutting it loose. 

46
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,040
Stay away from that door, mister. 

47
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,480
What's so precious about your goddamned cargo? 

48
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,680
The cargo is mine. I've leveraged everything I own against it. 

49
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,040
And it's not insured. 

50
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,600
What is wrong with these people? 

51
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,200
I go out that door, you'll shoot me. I stay here, we're all dead. 

52
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,360
Hold the tanks! 

53
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,320
Ohh! 

54
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,960
Let me tell you something. You ever put a gun in my face again.... 

55
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
You'll what? 

56
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,400
You figure it out. 

57
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
Sir, what about Foster's idea? 

58
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,080
I can reach the eye. 

59
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,760
I've let you down, lad. 

60
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,680
The water's coming in faster than it's going out. 

61
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,440
I can't believe we were so stupid to sign up with that guy again. 

62
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I would've decked him! 

63
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,280
He had us pulling 500 tons of lumber and steel, uninsured, in a typhoon 

64
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,200
100 miles from any normal shipping lane! 

65
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,840
Foster got tossed out of the Navy for hitting a superior officer. 

66
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,120
Hey, Hiko! Coming through. 

67
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,160
I'll tell you this - it's the last time we go for percentage of cargo. 

68
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,480
Damn straight. 

69
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,480
I told you it was a bad idea. 

70
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,760
My idea? It was your idea. 

71
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,760
It was your idea. 

72
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,720
How is it? 

73
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,720
It's bad. 

74
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Define "bad". 

75
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,720
We're sinking. 

76
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,720
That's bad. 

77
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,320
So does anyone have any suggestions? 

78
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,160
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Come back. 

79
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,120
Three or four days of supplies. 

80
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,120
That's food and that's water. 

81
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,080
All right, Hiko, put that back. We'll distribute this. 

82
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,560
NHF piece of junk! 

83
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,880
Hey, you buy this shit? 

84
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,960
Wait, wait, wait! I'm picking up a contact. 

85
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,760
There might be another ship in the eye with us. 

86
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,280
12 miles out. 

87
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,760
Speed - zero knots. Dead in the water but it's big. 

88
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,480
Hail it, Foster. 

89
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,560
Ahoy, vessel latitude 29 degrees south, longitude 179 degrees east. 

90
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,040
This is the Sea Star. 12 miles 

91
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,640
northwest of your position. Come back. 

92
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,200
So where the hell is the captain? 

93
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,880
KNOCK AT DOOR 

94
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,760
I'm busy. 

95
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,120
There's a ship in the eye, dead in the water, 12 miles out. 

96
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,440
Dead in the water? 

97
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
I'll be there in a minute. 

98
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,440
Dead in the water... 

99
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,120
Captain, dead ahead 300 yards. 

100
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,160
Hail it, Woods. 

101
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,320
Unidentified vessel, this is the Sea Star approaching from the northwest. 

102
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,760
Dead ahead! 300 yards! 

103
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,840
Unidentified vessel, this is the Sea Star 

104
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,240
approaching from the northwest. 

105
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,440
'Please come back. Over.' 

106
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,040
< You see anything? 

107
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,040
No. Not a thing. 

108
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
That ain't ours, brother. 

109
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,480
Unidentified vessel, this is the Sea Star. 

110
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,520
'Come back. Over.' 

111
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
'This is the Sea Star. Is anybody there? 

112
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,600
'Over.' 

113
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,080
She looks Russian. 

114
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,000
The Academic Vladislav Volkov. Missile and satellite tracking ship. 

115
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,600
45,000 tons full gross, 642ft, two steam turbines, 

116
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
ship's complement 300, armament none 

117
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,160
She's fitted for scientific purposes. 42 labs, 

118
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
five machine shops with advanced robotics. 

119
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,480
three parabolic dishes maintain communication with spacecraft. 

120
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,800
Ahoy! The Vladislav Volkov! 

121
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,440
I am the captain of the Sea Star. Is there anyone aboard? 

122
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,800
Ahoy! 

123
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Baker, 

124
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,520
break out the shotguns, flashlights and walkies. We're going aboard. 

125
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,400
Jesus Christ. This is kinda stupid, Stevie. 

126
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,720
Come on. 

127
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,480
Very stupid. 

128
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,080
Stevie, this is very stupid. 

129
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,320
Stevie, Stevie... Those are bullet holes. 

130
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,760
I don't like this at all, man. 

131
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,840
Ahoy the bridge! 

132
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,440
Anyone aboard? 

133
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,480
Bridge is deserted. 

134
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,720
What the hell happened in here? 

135
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,040
What a mess. 

136
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,600
Looks like somebody powered it down, Captain. 

137
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
Captain? Do you see anything? 

138
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,040
You'll be the first to know, Woods. 

139
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,320
What do you think? Pirates? 

140
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,440
Mafia, probably. 

141
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,440
Pipe down. Check the radio. 

142
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,280
Smashed. 

143
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,840
These logs are worthless. Unless somebody reads Russian. 

144
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,280
Storm wall 16 miles due east. You've about an hour and a half. 

145
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,680
He's, er, thinking, Foster. 

146
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,720
You know, something you were paid to do. 

147
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,040
You thinking what I'm thinking? 

148
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,080
Huh? 

149
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,960
THEY LAUGH 

150
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,960
What? What? 

151
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Salvage. Salvage, baby! 

152
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,560
You signed on for a percentage. But you never figured I'd bring you this 

153
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,160
A ship abandoned in international waters. 

154
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,240
Maritime law says she's a derelict. 

155
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,320
All we do is tow her to safety, slap a salvage lien on her 

156
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,200
and the Russians have to pay us 10% of her value to get her back. 

157
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,040
Richie, put a number on her for me. 

158
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,880
There's three satellite dishes, one kinda fucked up. 

159
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,960
42 labs all primed with, er... 

160
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,680
state-of-the-art stuff. 

161
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,080
Let's see. We're talking... 

162
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,280
200. 

163
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,360
300 million? 

164
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,360
300 million dollars. 

165
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,040
300 million dollars! Ten percent 

166
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,760
is 30 million dollars! That's what's comin' our way. 

167
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,520
The opportunity of a lifetime! 

168
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,120
That's about what? 30 grand apiece? 

169
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
300 Gs. 

170
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
300 Gs?! 

171
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,360
That's at one percent. Right? 

172
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm willing to change all that. 

173
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,080
Cut you in for ten percent. That's three million dollars each. 

174
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,080
What do you think of that? 

175
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,120
What do you think? 

176
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,680
Is it legal? 

177
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,680
Totally. Totally legal. 

178
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,760
Shit! I'm in if you're in. 

179
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,440
Yeah. I'm good. 

180
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,520
What about you, Foster? 

181
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
Oh, Foster, please, come on! 

182
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,560
- SQUEAKY: 
- Easy money! 

183
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,560
There's no such thing, Squeaky. 

184
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
I'll take that as a yes. 

185
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,200
Baker, find the generator. Try to get the main engine running. 

186
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Squeaky, you go, too. Richie, throw a line down to the tug. 

187
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Foster, try to get the navigation 

188
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,400
Captain, my father was an admiral. 

189
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,320
I know maritime law. If anybody's alive you can't claim her. 

190
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,320
Then let's not find anyone. 

191
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,000
What does that mean? 

192
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Just that. 

193
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,840
I hope we don't find anyone alive. 

194
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,880
Woods, come back to me. 

195
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
'We're gonna need to turn the ship into the wind.' 

196
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
It just doesn't add up. 

197
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Russian vessel, middle of nowhere, dead in the water, crew vanished. 

198
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,960
Why would they abandon ship? 

199
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I dunno. 

200
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
And who the hell can we trust? This is a lot of goddamn money. 

201
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,920
The only guys we can trust is just you and me, Stevie. 

202
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,960
I wouldn't take a cheque from the captain. 

203
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,760
Woods is wound so tight 

204
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
you couldn't pull a pin out of his ass with a tractor. 

205
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,000
And Hiko is... I don't understand what the hell Hiko is. 

206
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Richie's crazy like a fox, Stevie. 

207
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,080
But you know I'm thinking he might just be there for us. 

208
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
And Foster's good. 

209
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,920
Good? What do you mean by "good"? 

210
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,640
She's solid. On the level. What'd you think I meant? 

211
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Sounds like you think she's hot. 

212
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,640
Course I think she's hot. Don't you? 

213
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Right here, Stevie. 

214
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,880
Got it? 

215
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,880
Yeah. 

216
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Yeah, that's it. 

217
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Oh, shit. 

218
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,880
No go? 

219
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,880
Nope. 

220
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,360
What's wrong with this thing? 

221
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,000
Here's your problem. Looks like somebody trashed the control panel. 

222
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,920
Relays are unplugged. 

223
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,240
Let's hustle. We got no power to the rudder in a typhoon, we're screwed. 

224
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm hustling, right? 

225
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,120
OK. 

226
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Go? 

227
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,840
Give it a shot. 

228
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,320
ENGINE CROAKS 

229
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,000
SCREECHING 

230
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
That's more like it. 

231
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,280
'Captain?' 

232
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm on my way, Woods. 

233
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,480
HIGH-PITCHED SCREECHING 

234
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,560
What the hell's that? 

235
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,680
Good job, Baker. You lit us up like a pinball machine. 

236
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,160
MACHINE WHIRRING 

237
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,760
MACHINE CLICKS AND WHIRS 

238
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
I tell ya, we're gonna be rich! 

239
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,640
You're gonna be a rich man, Hiko. 

240
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,120
Captain? 

241
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,920
Somebody's running this. 

242
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,520
Looks like it's running itself. 

243
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,720
Computers don't do that. 

244
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
MONITOR BEEPS 

245
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't know about computers. That's an anchor. 

246
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,040
Captain! The anchor went down on the tug! 

247
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,240
Baker! Come back! We need you up here! 

248
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,480
Baker! We need you on deck now! 

249
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,080
On my way! Squeak, you catch that? 

250
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,600
What the hell happened? 

251
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,600
Any trouble, don't be a cowboy. 

252
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
Don't leave me too long. 

253
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,160
Stay on your radio. 

254
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,520
Woods! 

255
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,640
I'm gonna go get some help. 

256
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
Woods! 

257
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,960
Woods! 

258
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,080
Hiko! 

259
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,080
What are you doing?! 

260
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Leave me alone! 

261
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
Shit! 

262
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,160
Steve! 

263
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,040
I got you. 

264
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,840
DISTANT THUNDER 

265
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,840
That anchor didn't drop by itself. 

266
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,640
Somebody else is on board. 

267
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,640
I hear that! 

268
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,760
I'll be all right. 

269
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,760
Not without stitches. 

270
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Lift up. Lift up! 

271
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,720
Hold this. 

272
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,680
What are you lookin' at? 

273
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,640
Hey, it could've been me! 

274
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,280
'Stevie, what's going on up there?' 

275
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,280
We lost the tug, Squeak. 

276
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,200
'She's gone.' 

277
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,200
That sucks. 

278
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,560
'How we doing down there?' 

279
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,560
Fine. It's automated. Runs itself. 

280
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Negative. We got somebody on board. That's who sank the tug. 

281
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,000
'I want you to bolt the engine room door shut.' 

282
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,560
I copy that. Hurry up, will you? 

283
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,880
Let's split into two groups, root him out. 

284
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,880
I just have to fix his leg. 

285
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Hold your horses, mister! 

286
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,080
I'm still captain here! 

287
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,520
They left this on the bridge. 

288
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,920
You were captain of the Sea Star. She just sank, right? 

289
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm a ranking officer. 

290
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,760
Listen to me, Baker. For 30 million dollars, 

291
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,600
I'm willing to overlook all that's come between us. 

292
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
How about you? 

293
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Good man. 

294
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,160
- Richie! 
- Yeah? 

295
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,440
Take Woods. Go the engine room to Squeaky. 

296
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,400
We're going to take Hiko, 

297
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,840
get him to a sick bay, get that leg fixed. 

298
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,160
Stay away, Woods. 

299
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,400
You get me killed, I'm gonna kick your ass. Take my shit. Let's go. 

300
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Wait up for us, Foster. 

301
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,200
It'll be down that corridor. 

302
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,000
Where does this go, Richie? 

303
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,320
It goes down. Come on. 

304
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,280
METALLIC CLUNK 

305
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,720

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,560

MACHINE CHIRPS 

309
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,400
Hello! Listen, I'm a friend, all right? 

310
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,880
I'm Cuban. I'm not American! 

311
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,720
Anybody in there? 

312
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,880
Hello! 

313
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,320
LOUD CHIRPING

315
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,000
Christ! Stevie! CHIRPING GETS LOUDER

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,480
Weapons locker. 

317
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,000
What the hell is this all about? 

318
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,360
Bingo! 

319
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,520
Put him up here. Come on, Hiko. 

320
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,840
All right, tighten that down. 

321
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,840
All right, this is gonna hurt. 

322
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,840
Just get on with it. 

323
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
HE GASPS 

324
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
You have a high pain threshold. 

325
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,600
Yeah, I usually do it myself(!) No, really. 

326
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,360
Hey, Hiko! Some dry clothes. 

327
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,880
Yeah, thanks. 

328
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Oh, man... 

329
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,840
All right, here we go. 

330
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,920
Come on, Richie. Isn't that enough guns? 

331
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,640
Woods, you can never be too rich, too thin or too well armed. 

332
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,800
Yeah, let's go. 

333
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,960
Oh, man... 

334
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,920
Get the green bag. 

335
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,760
Green bag? Oh, man... 

336
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,360
I'm carrying too much. I got a bad latissimus. 

337
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,200
I'm tellin' ya, my back isn't gonna let me do this. 

338
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,920
I can't deal with it. 

339
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,080
I'm tellin' ya... Let me get rid of some of this crap. 

340
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,200
Hey, Woods, what do you make of this? 

341
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,280
I have no idea. 

342
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,160
Tactical short-range surface-to-air. 

343
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
This is beautiful, man! 

344
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,920
I'm thrilled(!) Can we go now? 

345
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,920
In a minute. Look around, man. 

346
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,960
I am. 

347
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,000
Hello, Mr Cable. 

348
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,040
Hey, Woods, cover this. 

349
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,680
Looks like some kind of ejection seat or escape vehicle. 

350
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Launch buttons. 

351
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,120
Cool. 

352
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,080
- < 
- Richie... 

353
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,720
Look at these doors, man. 

354
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,880
That's an awful lot of blood, Richie. 

355
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,840
Now can we go? 

356
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,840
Yeah. Yeah... 

357
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,440
Foster... What are you gonna do with your three million? 

358
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,480
I don't have it yet. 

359
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,120
What about you, Hiko? 

360
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,240
Three million? Probably open a school. 

361
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,720
A school? For what? 

362
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,200
Lots of little kids running around. Reading, writing, learning Maori. 

363
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Sweet. 

364
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
It's a dream thing. 

365
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,760
How about you, Baker? 

366
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,760
Oh, I don't know. 

367
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Always loved the sea. 

368
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Probably buy an island. 

369
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,160
Oh, yeah? 

370
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,440
Does it have a beach? 

371
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,440
Beautiful white sand. 

372
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Hammock, sailboat. 

373
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,280
What about a house? 

374
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,280
A villa. 

375
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,640
Thatched roof. Overlooking a lagoon. 

376
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,240
Sounds nice. 

377
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,240
When are you two gettin' married? 

378
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,400
Hey! 

379
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,840
Argh! Take it easy, mate! 

380
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,840
You take it easy! 

381
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,240
Is she dead? 

382
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,240
No. 

383
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,080
What's this shit, Richie? 

384
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,640
Somebody doesn't like electricity. 

385
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,560
Come on. 

386
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,480
It looks like somebody tried to rewire the ship. 

387
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,600
OK? 

388
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,600
Yeah. 

389
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,600
So that's done. 

390
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,600
What's all this stuff in her bag? 

391
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Videotapes, cigarettes. Hairspray? 

392
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,680
Watch out! They're micronades. 

393
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,240
What? 

394
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,000
Thermite. One of those things blows, burn a hole through a deck. 

395
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,720
Be careful. 

396
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,720
What, she wanted to sink the ship? 

397
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,480
Squeaky, talk to me. 

398
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,480
How does it feel? 

399
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,480
Good. Thanks. 

400
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,600
Are you gonna be able to walk? 

401
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,600
Yeah, I'll be OK. 

402
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,960
Squeak, que pasa, buddy? 

403
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,480
'Where the hell are you, man?' 

404
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,080
Shit! 

405
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Richie, Woods, come back. 

406
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,400
This ship's got a missile room. 

407
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
'I don't give a damn!' 

408
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Squeaky's not answering. Find him. 

409
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,920
'We got a crew member who unloaded an Uzi on us. You watch your ass.' 

410
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,560
Copy that. 

411
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm going to the engine room. 

412
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,400
I'll see you on the bridge. 

413
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,480
Steve... Watch your back. 

414
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,240
Hey, Woods... You comprehend this Cyrillic crap? 

415
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,960
It's just like chicken scratchings to me. 

416
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,000
SCREECHING 

417
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,400
Richie! Richie, help me! 

418
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,040
Hey, Woods... 

419
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,160
That thing smells like shit! What is it? 

420
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,760
It's robotic, Woodsie. High-tech robotics. 

421
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,720
Where'd you learn how to sew? 

422
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,720
My grandfather. 

423
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,760
It's all right. It's OK. We're not going to hurt you. 

424
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:36,280
The power. Turn off the power. Shut down the ship. You're in danger. 

425
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,440
What's she on about? 

426
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,440
I don't know. I don't know. 

427
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,680
Captain, please! 

428
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,080
What's your name? 

429
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,800
What happened on this ship? Where are her crew? 

430
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,440
Dead. 

431
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Dead? 

432
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,800
Good. 

433
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,080
Turn off the power. It needs power to move. 

434
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,280
What...needs...power? 

435
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,080
It. From the Mir. 

436
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,400
Mir space station? 

437
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,400
She's a fruitcake. 

438
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,400
Come on, Captain. 

439
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
She's a nutter. Perfect 

440
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,000
Hiko, come on! 

441
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,120
Drop it! 

442
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,840
Drop it! 

443
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,360
It's OK. 

444
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,360
You don't understand. 

445
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,560
Look... I'm not gonna hurt you. 

446
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,480
My name's Kelly Foster. 

447
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm a navigator. 

448
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
I'm Nadia. 

449
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,840
Nadia Vinogradiya. Chief science officer. 

450
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,200
Nadia... What happened? 

451
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Where's your crew? 

452
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,880
I told you. They all deserted. 

453
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,640
300 crew members...gone? 

454
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
What happened? 

455
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,840
A week ago during a transmission from Mir, something came on board. 

456
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,200
We thought our transmitters were malfunctioning so we shut down. 

457
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,880
It took control of computers, scanned information - language, 

458
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,840
encyclopaedias, medical data. It was learning. 

459
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,440
Learning what? 

460
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,440
How to kill us. 

461
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,440
My captain, Alexi, and me were the last to survive. 

462
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,400
We cut their cables, smashed them... 

463
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Wait. You just said "them". Before you said "it". 

464
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,480
Who's "them"? 

465
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Um, machines. 

466
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
Machines? 

467
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh... 

468
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,840
I'm telling you the truth. 

469
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,880
I-I know. 

470
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,520
- BANGING ON DECKS 
- Foster! 

471
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,520
Yeah, I'm in here. 

472
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,040
It's OK. Nobody's gonna hurt you. 

473
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,720
She's nuts. 

474
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,720
Something scared the hell out of her. 

475
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,040
Let's get her up to the bridge, Hiko? 

476
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Give me the flashlight. 

477
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,040
It's OK, it's OK. We'll get you something to eat. 

478
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,080
Come on, it's OK. 

479
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,520
You OK? 

480
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,440
Go! 

481
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,440
No! 

482
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Got her? 

483
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,800
I'm not a threat! I'm not a threat! 

484
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,400
I used to go turkey hunting with my dad. Beats the shit out of this. 

485
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,000
FAINT WHIRRING 

486
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,000
Shh! Shh! You hear that? 

487
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,880
Sounds like somebody's working. 

488
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Oh, God... 

489
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,880
Hey! Anybody in here? 

490
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,880
Quiet, man! 

491
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Damn. There might be somebody. 

492
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,880
Hey, Woodsie. There's another of those things. 

493
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,600
FLIPS SWITCH 

494
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,040
Let's go, man! I'm outta here. 

495
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,240
MACHINE SQUEAKS 

496
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,600
Richie? Woods? Where the hell are you? 

497
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,320
Hey, Steve, listen. There's a machine shop down here with, er...5 

498
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,800
state-of-the-art robotics. 

499
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,200
I said to get your asses down to the engine room. 

500
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,320
Yeah, yeah. We're coming. 

501
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,840
Come on, Woodsie. 

502
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm not coming. 

503
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,760
Hey, little buddy. 

504
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,400
Richie, let's go. 

505
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,400
Did the other one bother you? 

506
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,440
Huh? No, it didn't. 

507
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,560
Richie... 

508
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,800
Richie... 

509
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,640
GUN FIRES 

510
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,640
Goddamn! 

511
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,080
Arrghhh! 

512
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,320
GUN FIRES 

513
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,040
I'm not taking this shit, man! 

514
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,040
Shit! 

515
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,040
Oh, God! 

516
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,280
This is Richie. There's a Russian here. The sonofabitch shot at us! 

517
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,000
'Woods is hurt. So watch it.' 

518
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Copy that. How is he? 

519
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,520
Just tell him it's bad. Ow! Yeah, bad! 

520
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,680
He'll live but he ain't in a good mood, man. 

521
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,000
Get him to the engine room. No more sightseeing. 

522
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, copy. 

523
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,800
Get up, get up. 

524
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,760
Squeaky... 

525
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,240
Squeak? 

526
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,080
Holy shit. 

527
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,440
What the hell... 

528
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,640
Oh, my God... 

529
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,400
Jesus Christ... Squeak! 

530
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,440
HE BANGS ON DOOR 

531
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,000
Squeak! Open up! 

532
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,120
- (BANG!) 
- Ow! 

533
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,000
Don't shoot. It's us! 

534
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Where the hell have you been? Back from your holiday? 

535
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,960
Jesus Christ... 

536
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,400
Woods, you're a mess. 

537
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,400
Thank you. 

538
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,760
You said a Russian did this? 

539
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,760
A machine did that with a nail gun. 

540
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,600
Yeah, that's right. You gotta see it. 

541
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,760
There's some weird shit. 

542
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,760
"Weird" ain't the word. 

543
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,760
I need medical attention. 

544
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,040
Shut the fuck up! 

545
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,040
I don't belong on this ship. 

546
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,640
Someone just welded the engine room door shut. Squeaky's still missing. 

547
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,600
HE SNIFFS Richie... 

548
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,440
Richie... It's that smell again. 

549
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,360
- Squeak? 
- Squeaky! 

550
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,240
ROBOTIC RUSSIAN VOICE 

551
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,240
Is that you? 

552
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,520
Shit! 

553
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,960
Go! 

554
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
You're all going to die. 

555
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,680
Hear that, Foster? 

556
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,160
We're all going to die(!) 

557
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,040
Because there are aliens on this ship(!) 

558
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,560
That's all the grounds I need. 

559
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,480
One of my men is missing. And I want some answers. 

560
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,480
And no more of this Twilight Zone stuff. 

561
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,280
I don't know about your men. 

562
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,560
Rubbish. I'm going to give you five seconds. 

563
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,440
Then I'll blow your brains out. One... 

564
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,160
She doesn't know where he is. She was in sick bay! 

565
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,800
She knows. She dropped an anchor on my tug. She fired at us. Two... 

566
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,040
Captain! Hiko, come on! 

567
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,360
I'm not feeling sympathetic. 

568
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,360
Me neither. 

569
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,640
Three... 

570
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,640
I don't care. Just shut down the power. 

571
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,920
Captain... She's not going to tell you what you want to hear. 

572
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,560
Hey, what has she to say about this? 

573
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,160
Up here on the chart table, Richie. 

574
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Bastard! 

575
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,040
What the bloody hell is that? 

576
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,320
It beats the hell out of us. 

577
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,160
It's Alexi. My captain. 

578
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,600
Whatever IT is, it tried to kill us. 

579
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,720
Squeaky's still AWOL. 

580
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,280
Somebody welded the engine room door shut. We're not alone. 

581
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,240
She's got a friend. Someone explain what is going on! 

582
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,760
Finish your story, Nadia. 

583
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,480
The energy that came from the Mir 

584
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,360
infested all of the ship's electrical systems - 

585
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,360
mainframe computer, labs, machine shops. 

586
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:32,280
They activated fire extinguishers. 67 died from gas poisoning. 

587
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,560
A quarter of the crew. 

588
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,080
It cut us off from machine shops 

589
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,400
and started building the little ones first - 

590
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,400
the gatherers. 

591
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,240
We saw lots of them. One nailed Woods. 

592
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Then came something... 

593
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,480
more dangerous. 

594
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Half man, half machine. 

595
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,400
Biomechanism engineering beyond our comprehension. 

596
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,480
The rest of the crew deserted, taking their chances in the sea. 

597
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,840
Only Alexi and me stayed, cutting cables. 

598
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,520
Why cutting cables? 

599
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,320
Machines are controlled by the electrical energy in the computer. 

600
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,280
If we cut their source of power, they die. 

601
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,360
We cut these to get him here. 

602
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:26,240
What the hell are you talking about? What is this thing in the computer? 

603
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,360
It's a lifeform. Not cellular but electrical in nature. 

604
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,320
Extremely intelligent. 

605
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,480
Lightning that can think? 

606
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,200
It has no shape but it's giving itself what it lacks. 

607
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,400
It's creating a new lifeform 

608
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
using the ship and crew. 

609
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,960
Blood is still pumping through his brain. There's no decomposition. 

610
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,200
Yeah, right here, 

611
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,920
some kind of coil, a self-contained power supply. 

612
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,680
Amazing... This brain is still alive. 

613
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,320
Stop fuckin' around with the damn thing! 

614
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,840
I'm just looking at it, Steve. 

615
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,400
Alexi? 

616
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,080
SHE SCREAMS 

617
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,120
Touch it again, I cut your hands off. 

618
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,120
I can respect that. 

619
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,720
It's still Alexi. It's Alexi! 

620
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
Rubbish! > 

621
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,360
It's a pile of Russian rubbish! And I won't listen to any more of it. 

622
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,040
There's no alien. It's something their government cooked up! 

623
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,240
It went wrong. It ran amok and you think the world will find out! 

624
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,120
Dr Igor fuckin' Frankenstein there. 

625
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,400
Tell 'em the truth. It's some kind of medical experiment. 

626
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,440
Alexi was no medical experiment. 

627
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,120
He was my husband. 

628
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,960
Rubbish. 

629
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,240
Could someone come and look at the nails in my shoulder? 

630
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,960
Woods, stop whining! 

631
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,040
No! 

632
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,960
Ow! God! 

633
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,280
Ow! 

634
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,880
Oh, my God... 

635
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,280
Captain! 

636
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,880
Brace yourselves! 

637
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,960
We got to turn her into the wind! 

638
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,760
The steering doesn't answer! 

639
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,680
We can steer from the engine room. 

640
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,680
You said the door was welded. 

641
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,680
We cut the damn door! 

642
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,000
Bring her. I want to keep her in my sight. 

643
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,480
IT SCREECHES 

644
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,160
I gotta get off this ship. 

645
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,560
All clear. 

646
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,560
Clear! 

647
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,600
Clear. 

648
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,000
SHIP RUMBLES 

649
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,720
Did you feel that? 

650
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,560
The ship's turning. 

651
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,280
We turned 20 degrees. It's steering itself. 

652
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,680
Ships don't steer themselves. 

653
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,200
She's altered her course. 

654
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,920
Let's go. 

655
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,840
Engine room's one deck down. 

656
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,600
METAL CLUNKS 

657
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,600
What the hell was that? 

658
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,160
Could be Squeak. 

659
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,160
I don't care 

660
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,160
I said it could be Squeak! 

661
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,520
Steve... 

662
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,400
Jesus Christ.... 

663
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,440
METAL CLANGS 

664
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,960
Careful, Richie. 

665
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,960
Yeah. 

666
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,760
It's too weird. Don't open it. 

667
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,760
What is it? 

668
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,760
I don't know. 

669
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,040
What you got? 

670
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,040
It could be Squeaky. 

671
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,040
Let me see. Let me see! 

672
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,960
What the hell is that? 

673
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,360
Open the door! 

674
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,360
Don't open the damn door! 

675
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,160
Squeak? 

676
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,160
Steve. 

677
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,680
Steve! 

678
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,600
Richie! Help me, for God's sake! 

679
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,840
Richie! 

680
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,880
Shit! 

681
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,400
Richie! 

682
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,160
This way! This way! 

683
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,520
Steve. 

684
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,080
Where are we? 

685
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,080
Communications room. 

686
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,080
I'll call for help! 

687
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,720
BANGING ON DOOR 

688
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,480
Did you trash this? 

689
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,480
Every transmitter. 

690
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,800
BANG! 

691
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,360
BANG! 

692
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,400
Well, you didn't smash this one. Mayday! 

693
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,800
No! 

694
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,480
What the hell is wrong with you?! Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! 

695
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,360
No-one is gonna claim salvage on this vessel but us. 

696
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,400
You're no longer in charge! 

697
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,000
Come here! 

698
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,200
BANG! 

699
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,560
BANG! 

700
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,120
What do they want? 

701
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,120
It wants to kill us. 

702
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,880
They want something from us. 

703
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,880
It wants to mutilate us. 

704
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,360
Did you see Squeaky? It wants something from us! 

705
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,040
Why don't we talk to it? It's in the computer. 

706
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,520
What?! 

707
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,520
It's in the computer, right? 

708
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,960
What the hell? 

709
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,800
What do I do? 

710
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,080
Nadia, help. I need English. 

711
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,480
Who are you? 

712
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,600
ANNOUNCES OVER PA 

713
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,360
Is that it? Is that the thing? 

714
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,720
We mean you no harm. 

715
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,440
ANNOUNCES OVER PA 

716
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,120
'Species is destructive, invasive, noxious, harmful to the whole.' 

717
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,560
What species? 

718
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,400
Great. Just great(!) It thinks we're germs. 

719
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,480
What do you want from us? 

720
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,920
'Viscous neurological transmitters.' 

721
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,880
What the hell is that? 

722
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,600
Part of an optic nerve. 

723
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,600
What? 

724
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,800
Spare parts. It wants us for spare parts. 

725
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,360
BANG! 

726
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,240
- It must be destroyed. 
- How? 

727
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:56,520
It's electrical. What happens when lightning hits water? 

728
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,520
It drowns out. 

729
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,160
It dissipates and dies. We can kill it! 

730
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,160
If we sink the ship. 

731
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,120
Where's the mainframe? 

732
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,120
D deck, one deck below. 

733
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,280
She's right. We kill the computer! 

734
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,040
We gotta get out of here! 

735
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,000
You want a way out? I'll show you a way out! 

736
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,080
Steve. 

737
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,520
Spare parts, my ass, man! 

738
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,320
I ain't going up against them again. You do what you want! 

739
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,280
I'm outta here! 

740
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,280
Get down! 

741
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
You're crazy! 

742
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,280
Who's gonna carry my shit?! Who's gonna carry my shit?! 

743
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,760
He's gone postal, man. 

744
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
Come on, let's go! 

745
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,600

You coming? 

747
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,680
You hit a superior officer, Foster. 

748
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,480
You pushed me! 

749
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,480
Fuck you! 

750
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,000
You'll get yourselves killed!

That door down there leads to the main computer room. 

770
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,400
I thought you said this was gonna be well protected. Hiko! 

771
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,840
- It's gone. 
- Gone where? 

772
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,360

Thank you. 

776
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,920
They're planning to sink this ship. 

777
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,280
But of course you know that, don't you? 

778
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,760
It's pretty amazing. 

779
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,800
What with no head an' all.

01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,880

How can I be of assistance to you? 

787
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,880
Help me 

788
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,960

789
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,920
It's welded! We just came through here! 

790
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,920
We've been set up! 

791
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,600
This way. 

792
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,600
Let's go! 

793
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,200
Six years in the navy as a weapons specialist. 

794
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,280
Graduated top of my class! 

795
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,880
I'm gettin' out. If it thinks it's smarter than me, 

796
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,000
it's gonna get a surprise. 

797
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,720
Where are we going? 

798
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,720
We can get out through here. 

799
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,600
METAL CLANGS Ow! It's welded! What's there? 

800
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,240
Dead end! 

801
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,240
We need to pry this!

01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,160
Hiko! 

806
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,640
Steve, over here! 

807
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,360
Hiko! 

808
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,400
Hiko! 

809
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,480
Come on! Let's go! Move! 

810
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,560
Hiko! 

811
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
Nadia, which way?! 

812
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,400
The antenna control room! 

813
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,080
OK! Steve! 

814
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,400
Right behind you! Go! Just keep moving! 

815
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,320
Keep going, Hiko, keep going. 

816
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,560
Arrghh! 

817
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,000

Help me, Hiko! 

820
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,880

01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,640

01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,240

01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,000
Hiko! 

828
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Foster! Come on! 

829
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,040
He's gone. Keep moving! 

830
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Maybe he got to another part of the ship. 

831
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,520
Not a chance! 

832
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,480
Just a little goodbye gift. 

833
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,360
We must find out where it's taking us! Steve! 

834
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,840
Give me a hand! 

835
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,080
We need a light. 

836
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,520
We're headed here on this vector. 

837
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,280
North northwest. Lord Howe Island. 

838
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,160
Lord Howe? Why? There's nothing there. 

839
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,080
There is. 

840
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:50,640
A British Intelligence station with digital link-ups to satellites. 

841
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,920
If it's in the Transoceanic Pacific Cable it can go anywhere!

01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,040
"If you cannot transmit, respond by flare." 

847
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,040
We need a flare gun! 

848
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,720
No! We need to warn them away! 

849
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,720
Why?! 

850
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:19,120
This thing is isolated on the ship! We can't let another ship near us. 

851
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,520
We gotta sink this ship. 

852
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,680
How? 

853
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,880
Flood the hold with fuel and detonate it. 

854
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800

You don't recognise me.

What's wrong? 

860
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,920
I'm still your captain, Foster. 

861
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,920
You must treat me with respect. 

862
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,720
We know where you're going. 

863
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,840

Get down! 

867
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,400

01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,440
We must hurry. Come on.

- Put the gun down. 
- It's us! 

873
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,080
- How do I know that? 
- Put it down. 

874
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,920
I'm gonna blow this ship. Come with us. 

875
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,920
I got my own plan.

Come on. Let's go.

01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,080
That should do it. 

881
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,240
Checkmate. 

882
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,800
I gave us 15 minutes. We should warn Richie. 

883
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,800
Richie, we're leaving the ship! 

884
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,480

01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,600
Get up. We gotta go. 

901
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,400
Steve! Richie! 

902
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,000
Come on! 

903
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,160
Foster. 

904
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,280
Foster, this way. This way! 

905
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,920
It's not coming. 

906
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,960
Foster... Foster... 

907
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,560
Foster, look. Look. 

908
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,440
Survival suits. Maybe we have a chance. 

909
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,600
Put it on. Put it on. 

910
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,480
Richie... 

911
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,160
Richie... 

912
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,200
Oh, man... 

913
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:09,680
I thought you bailed on us, bro. I thought you weren't coming back. 

914
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,720
Shows you how smart I am. 

915
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,920
Hey, Steve... 

916
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,200
There is still a way to get off this ship. 

917
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,800
What? 

918
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,680
But you got to get to the missile room. 

919
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,840
Missile room? 

920
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,840
You'll understand when you're there. 

921
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,400
Steve... 

922
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,960
Mason! 

923
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,160
Mason! 

924
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,800
Shit. 

925
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,840
Nadia, stop! 

926
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,520
Nadia! 

927
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,280
- There's no time! 
- I must know it's dead. 

928
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,480
- It's gonna blow! 
- I must be sure! 

929
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,080
- Nadia, it's suicide! 
- I don't care! 

930
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,120

Foster... 

934
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,880
Get to the upper deck. Get off the ship. Tell people what happened. 

935
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,560
No! No! 

936
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,000
Go! 

937
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:57,040
ARE THERE ANY MORE DEVICES ON BOARD? 

938
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,160
Just one more. 

939
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,000
NO!! 

940
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,920
MACHINE SCREECHES 

941
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,960
Argh! 

942
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,280
It's me - Baker! It's me! 

943
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,840

I can't! 

947
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,720
You don't have a choice! Get the hell up! 

948
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,640
Come on!

01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,880
LOUD CLUNKING AND SCRAPING

Where are we? 

951
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,200
The missile bay! Check the door! 

952
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,520
It's blocked! 

953
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,520
Foster! 

954
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,400
Look at this! It's a rocket loader! 

955
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,360
It's an ejection seat. 

956
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,520
Let's go! 

957
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,520
No! 

958
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,160
Get in! 

959
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,160
No! 

960
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,520
I'm not going without you! 

961
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,520
Get in! There's no time! 

962
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,160
Richie rigged this for one. OK? 

963
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,800
And you're it. 

964
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,400
Let's go. Come on, come on! 

965
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,400
Foster, go! 

966
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,400
Not without you! 

967
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,480
That's one hell of a flare. 

968
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,640
HELICOPTER OVERHEAD 

969
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,960

973
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,760
You hear me? We made it. 

974
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,800
