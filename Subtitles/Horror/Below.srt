only fires one torpedo.

534
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:55,301
and he fell... he hit his head.

535
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,032
And he was... he went under
before we could get to him.

536
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:04,635
I heard you were asking.

537
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:06,339
So he drowned.

538
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:10,776
We already radioed Connecticut
with news of the accident.

539
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,713
[Sighs]

540
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,051
[Chuckles]

541
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:19,218
You know, we really,
really got off

542
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:21,854
on the wrong foot, and I...

543
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:24,955
So j-just feel free to move
about the forward sections of...

544
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,160
[Electricity crackles]

545
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,008
Sorry, sir...
humidity builds up,

546
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:44,210
drips out the power bus.

547
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:46,014
I'll get right on it.

548
00:38:48,022 --> 00:38:51,549
So... would you reconsider
England...

549
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:53,150
finding a port there?

550
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:55,388
I'm sorry.

551
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,765
[Grunts]

552
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:06,170
Sorry for what?

553
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:13,378
Uh, she was...
asking about Winters.

554
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,707
What did you tell her?

555
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:20,617
The story.

556
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,995
Well, it's coming up
astern, but...

557
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:34,526
[Rumbling]

558
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:36,695
I don't know what that is.

559
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:39,934
[Rumbling continues,
clanking]

560
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:44,403
[Loud thud]

561
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:47,448
[Rumbling, creaking]

562
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:58,119
[Rumbling, thudding continue]

563
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:07,561
Hooks!
They're using their hooks!

564
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,801
[Clanking]

565
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,406
Mr. Loomis, what do we do?

566
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,914
What are your orders,
Mr. Brice?

567
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,309
Mr. Loomis,
the helm is waiting!

568
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:29,322
The men are waiting
for your orders, Mr. Brice!

569
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,531
Aah!

570
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:46,029
Get out! Get out!

571
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:48,837
Everybody, out!
Move it out!

572
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,434
[Indistinct shouting]

573
00:40:50,512 --> 00:40:53,310
Go! Go! Go!
Everybody, out!

574
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,109
- Come on!
- Get out!

575
00:40:54,182 --> 00:40:56,844
[Echoing]
Get out! Get out!

576
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:01,619
Get down there, Harry!
Move!

577
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:06,555
[Creaks]

578
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,721
[Clicking]

579
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:10,195
Get out.

580
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:13,701
O'Dell, make sure
everybody's out!

581
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:16,896
- Everybody's out, sir!
- Then close the goddamn hatch!

582
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:19,565
- Blow safety!
- Blow safety!

583
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,006
What heading, sir?!

584
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:23,475
Any goddamn heading!
Just get us out of here!

585
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,842
[Whirring, engines roar]

586
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,524
[Poles squeak]

587
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:52,435
[Shivering]

588
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:02,345
You'll do better
at the board of inquiry.

589
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,292
[Clicking, hatch opens]

590
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,369
[Clicking, whirring]

591
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,602
We're sloughing oil,
and it's bad.

592
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:31,110
I don't know exactly
where it is,

593
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:34,170
but it's somewhere between the
pressure hull and the sea hull.

594
00:42:34,248 --> 00:42:36,842
And if it's leaking here
or here,

595
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:39,079
then it's dumping oil
under the main ballast,

596
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,246
which means that every time
we surface or dive...

597
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:42,880
We leave an oil slick.

598
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:45,152
Well, that's how...
that's how he's been riding us.

599
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:47,217
This boat <i>is</i> cursed.

600
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:54,160
Figure of speech.

601
00:42:54,235 --> 00:42:56,169
So how do we fix it?

602
00:42:56,237 --> 00:43:00,071
Well, there's only one way...
from the outside in.

603
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:03,167
[Thudding]

604
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:07,647
They'll be lining up
for this job.

605
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:10,309
Okay, so let's make ready
some dive gear.

606
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:11,817
All right.

607
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:14,150
O'Dell, pick two volunteers...

608
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:15,518
Yes, sir.

609
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,217
...besides yourself.

610
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:25,157
WALLY: You want someone
to free-dive outside with you

611
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:28,998
into the cold, black water,
make our way below the boat,

612
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,503
locate the floodboards,

613
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:32,334
and slither in between
the two hulls?

614
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:34,465
That's right.
Find the leak and fix it.

615
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:35,702
- At night.
- Hang on.

616
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:37,107
We're still submerged.

617
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:39,112
That means the main tanks are
full of water.

618
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,112
This is in the dark, Dell.

619
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:41,773
Yeah, well, chief thinks
that with the tower flooded,

620
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:43,282
it gives the boat enough weight
to stay down

621
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:45,546
while we blow some air
into the main tank.

622
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,214
Oh, well [Scoffs] if that's
what the chief thinks.

623
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:51,520
So... you're gonna go out there.
You're gonna go outside.

624
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:52,684
Yes, that's right.

625
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,853
With all these... happenings
happening.

626
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:56,726
Look alive.

627
00:43:57,932 --> 00:44:00,230
All right.

628
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:02,292
Who are the lucky bastards?

629
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:07,302
[Scoffs] Fuck, no.

630
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:14,905
Set.

631
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:30,195
I asked him to go.
Buddy system.

[Hatch opens, creaking]

00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,453
- [Muffled] Ooh!
- Oh, shit!

643
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:13,689
You and me, O'Dell.
Forward.

644
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:16,252
You guys take aft.

645
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:23,169

Shit!

649
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,088
BRICE: 2330 hours.

650
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:51,927
To confirm sinking
of German ship,

651
00:47:51,998 --> 00:47:54,432
four officers go topside...

652
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:58,961
Commander Winters, myself,
Lieutenant Loomis,

653
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,702
and Lieutenant
J.G. Stephen Coors.

654
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:09,842
The night we lost
Old Man Winters...

655
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,350
Odd time to bring that up.

656
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:14,580
It's an odd place.

657
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:22,217
So, how'd he bang his head
before he went over?

658
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:23,455
You heard.

659
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,027
I heard that the boat
hit something,

660
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:30,160
but I never felt it down below.

661
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:31,362
[Thudding]

662
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:44,641
What?!

663
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:46,309
I didn't say anything.

664
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:49,219
I know,
but what were you thinking?

665
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,190
Well...

666
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:57,288
I used to hear about
these dock workers.

667
00:48:57,363 --> 00:49:00,127
They would get welded up
in these kind of places.

668
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:05,136
And then... they were
never heard from again.

669
00:49:05,204 --> 00:49:06,637
Wally?

670
00:49:06,706 --> 00:49:09,903
You are so fucking
out-of-bounds with that shit!

671
00:49:22,422 --> 00:49:24,253
Let's keep moving.

672
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:34,862
Forward trim tank,
it looks like.

673
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:36,367
Better drive some wedges.

674
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:37,425
Yeah.

675
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:40,669
[Grunts, exhales sharply]

676
00:49:42,275 --> 00:49:46,211
So anything I say...
stays here...

677
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:47,712
this side of the hull.

678
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:51,045
[Breathlessly]
Yeah. Yeah.

679
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:53,051
There were survivors
from the sinking.

680
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,610
- [Indistinct shouting]
- Brice and Loomis even, uh...

681
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:57,952
even tried to fish a few out,

682
00:49:58,024 --> 00:50:01,460
but... Winters had other ideas,

683
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,791
and, uh...

684
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:06,855
he ordered a gunnery party
topside.

685
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,525
Well, three of us had a problem

686
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:11,365
with machine-gunning
those men right in the water,

687
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:13,769
I mean,
even if they were German.

688
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:16,431
There was an argument.

689
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:20,606
It got kind of heated.

690
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,381
Well, why didn't you tell us?!

691
00:50:27,453 --> 00:50:28,647
I guess, uh...

692
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:32,223
I guess we were trying
to protect him...

693
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,122
felt Winters was
a pretty good C.O.,

694
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:36,753
even if he could be a tough
son of a bitch sometimes.

695
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:40,595
For his reputation...
you know, his family's sake.

696
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,293
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

697
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:44,233
I still don't see
how he hit his head.

698
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:51,568
Slippery metal.

699
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:54,068
Bad footing.

700
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:57,682
Accidents happen, right?

701

[Both gasping]

704
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:32,112
Where the hell did
that come from?!

705
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:33,277
Near or aft?

706
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,520
Crew, sound off!

707
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:38,113
Get them out of there!
Get them out!!

708
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:39,123
O'Dell!

709
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:40,454
[Clanking]

710
00:51:40,526 --> 00:51:43,017
Sound off, O'Dell!

711
00:51:49,035 --> 00:51:50,468
- Oh!
- Sir!

712
00:51:50,536 --> 00:51:52,697
Fuck, was that you?

713
00:51:52,772 --> 00:51:54,740

715
00:52:14,694 --> 00:52:18,460
[Shuddering]
We gotta get him out.

716
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,328
Come on, guys.

717
00:52:20,399 --> 00:52:21,991
- How are we gonna...
- [Thudding]

718
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:29,372
Did you see that?

719
00:52:48,661 --> 00:52:50,458
What happened, guys?! Come on!
What happened out there?!

720
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,361
[All talking]

721
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:53,420
- Talk to me.
- Don't touch me.

722
00:52:53,499 --> 00:52:54,557
Did you fix it?

723
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:56,534
Which one of you boys
was screaming out there?

724
00:52:56,602 --> 00:52:58,126
- Are we a man down?
- Don't touch me!

725
00:52:58,204 --> 00:52:59,637
- Are we a man down?!
- Shut up!

726
00:52:59,705 --> 00:53:00,637
Who was screaming?!

727
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,697
Come on, grow some dicks
and shut up!

728
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:04,037
[Choking]

729
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:06,635
Now, where is Mr. O...

[Thudding]

731
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:14,216
Coors... where's Coors?

732
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:20,223
You tell me that's him.

733
00:53:20,293 --> 00:53:22,887
That's gotta be Coors.
He's still alive, right?

734
00:53:22,962 --> 00:53:24,554
Sir...

735
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,929
that is the one person
I can guarantee it's not.

[Thudding continues]

737
00:53:38,511 --> 00:53:40,308
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

738
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:41,607
- Don't! Don't!
- Hey, easy.

739
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:43,239
Easy, Stumbo.
Easy, easy.

740
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:45,250
- Easy, easy.
- Was that a "B"...

741
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:47,616
dash, dot, dot, dot?

742
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:48,915
I didn't hear a "B."

[Thudding continues]

744
00:53:50,323 --> 00:53:52,917
Dot, dash..."A"...
thought I heard an "A."

00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:55,222
No, that's not morse.

746
00:53:55,294 --> 00:53:57,660
It's just some shit
got caught up on the bow planes.

747
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,630
Now it's smacking up against...

748
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:02,031
"C"... you hear a "C"?

749
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:04,535
Dash, dot, dash, dot...
definitely a "C."

750
00:54:04,604 --> 00:54:06,299
It's hull sounds.

751
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:09,136
You guys are getting lathered up
about hull sounds.

752
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:12,109
Now, would somebody please tell
us what happened to Mr. Coors?

753
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:15,204
"Back"... B-A-C-K.

754
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:16,009
He's back.

755
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:17,413
And where'd you get
the "K" from?

756
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:19,075
Dash, dot, dash...
while you were talking.

757
00:54:19,151 --> 00:54:21,119
Hey, champ, you can stay
the hell out of this.

758
00:54:21,187 --> 00:54:24,281
- And the rest of you...
- Enough, already, enough!

759
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:26,917
In the wardroom, 5 minutes.

760
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:29,826
Keep your mouths shut
till we debrief.

761
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,594
LOOMIS:
Did you finish the job?

762
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,099
Yes, sir, absolutely.

763
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:36,896
Right, Wally? Wally?

764
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,903
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.

765
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:43,133
All right, so, look,
if the weather is good,

766
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:45,234
we surface tonight,
we recharge the batteries.

767
00:54:45,311 --> 00:54:47,074
We pour on the diesel,
keep pushing for the barn.

768
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:49,239
O'DELL: Our barn?

769
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:52,375
Mr. Brice, southern English
port's gonna be

770
00:54:52,451 --> 00:54:54,510
more than two days away.

771
00:54:54,587 --> 00:54:56,179
Two days away, Mr. Brice!

772
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,519
[Indistinct conversations]

773
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:01,424
Kingsley here is a navigational
officer. He knows the way.

774
00:55:01,494 --> 00:55:03,086
I know all the ports,
the depths,

775
00:55:03,162 --> 00:55:05,096
where the submarine nets are,
the mine fields.

776
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:06,859
Yeah, and have
the R.A.F. bomb us

777
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,332
because they mistake us
for a hostile boat... okay.

778
00:55:09,402 --> 00:55:11,233
There are safety corridors
that we can use...

779
00:55:11,303 --> 00:55:12,998
Considered and rejected,
thank you.

780
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:16,303
Mr. Brice, both our periscopes
are down, our sonar is gone.

781
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:18,536
We are blind and nearly deaf.

782
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:19,543
Our men are in a bad way,

783
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:21,375
and now we've lost
two of our senior officers.

784
00:55:21,447 --> 00:55:23,005
Welcome to the war, O'Dell.

785
00:55:23,082 --> 00:55:24,845
This has nothing to do
with the war.

786
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:27,283
Just how much longer
can we not say

787
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:28,843
what we're all thinking?

788
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:34,450
No one wants to be the first?

789
00:55:34,527 --> 00:55:36,495
Fine. Allow me.

790
00:55:36,562 --> 00:55:38,291
This submarine is haun...

791
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:40,958
When I want your opinion,
Miss Page, I'll give it to you.

792
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:45,026
I am not one of your men that
you can just dismiss, Mr. Brice!

793
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:49,031
I don't believe
we're alone down here,

794
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:51,542
and I know some of you think
the same way.

795
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:54,209
Unless we find
a safe harbor soon,

796
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,304
we're all going to end up like
your friend Mr. Coors.

797
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:57,645
The loss of Lieutenant Coors
is unfortunate.

798
00:55:57,717 --> 00:56:00,277
It fails to affect our plans.

803
00:56:10,796 --> 00:56:13,196

what the penalty is
for mutiny at sea,

807

it's gonna take me

to open the armory
and reload that sidearm.

Now, do either of you
care to say anything else

810
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:29,442
that might further agitate
this crew or me?

...we didn't sink 'em?

01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,297
Right. Uh...

889
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,133
[Muttering indistinctly]

890
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:23,470
May I ask why you're asking?

891
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:27,136
Just in case the boat
can't make it back home...

892
01:01:27,212 --> 01:01:29,146
for whatever reason.

893
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:31,808
LOOMIS: What do you suggest
we do about it, chief?

894
01:01:31,883 --> 01:01:33,214
[Indistinct voice]

895
01:01:33,284 --> 01:01:34,876
Come on.
Enough of the guessing games.

896
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:37,888
- Pressure blinding the shafts.
- No, I don't think that's it.

897
01:01:37,956 --> 01:01:39,389
Just lay it out for us, chief.

898
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:40,890
What about the I.M.O. pumps?

899
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:43,792
I.M.O. pumps check out.
I don't think it's that either.

900
01:01:43,861 --> 01:01:46,694
The rudder has a dedicated line
from here to the stern.

901
01:01:46,764 --> 01:01:49,858
If we tap into there
somewhere aft,

902
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:52,528
I think we should regain
our steering.

903
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:54,902
But where are you gonna tap in?

904
01:01:54,973 --> 01:01:56,406
That's the thing.

905
01:01:56,474 --> 01:01:59,238
The line goes right through
the battery room.

906
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,505
That's a little dicey, isn't it,
without venting first?

907
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:04,104
Just threading up
new hydraulics, no welding.

908
01:02:04,182 --> 01:02:05,774
Well, where are we at, anyway?

909
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:06,782
13 percent down.

910
01:02:06,851 --> 01:02:09,445
- 13 percent hydrogen?
- Keep your voice down.

911
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,116
Look, I don't know any other
way to regain control...

912

Fuck if I know.

915
01:02:27,405 --> 01:02:30,340
All right, but you gotta
make sure you're sealed off,

916
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:32,842
'cause we don't want a repeat
of the <i>Hindenburg</i> here.

917
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,400
Let's keep this quiet.

918
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:42,011
As if it's a bloody
mechanical problem.

919
01:02:42,086 --> 01:02:44,020
[Hinges creak, hatch slams]

What's happened here, hmm?

925
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:50,180
What is this?

926
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:59,695
Go to the galley.
Get a cup of coffee.

927
01:03:59,764 --> 01:04:01,493
Oh, no, I'm fine, sir.
Really.

928
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:03,329
You're falling asleep, champ.

929
01:04:03,401 --> 01:04:05,631
- I'll watch your bubble.
- Yes, sir.

930
01:04:09,941 --> 01:04:12,372
Lieutenant, a word?

931
01:04:12,442 --> 01:04:13,966
- Not now.
- No, Mr. Loomis.

932
01:04:16,146 --> 01:04:18,478
We need to speak right now.

933
01:04:19,682 --> 01:04:22,242

What else would it be?

937
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:37,296
Come on.

938
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:39,835
Let's get that rudder working.

939
01:04:39,903 --> 01:04:41,666
Now, maybe this is
just a coincidence.

940
01:04:41,738 --> 01:04:43,729
I know Lieutenant Coors
wasn't too sure

941
01:04:43,807 --> 01:04:45,468
about the last star fix.

942
01:04:45,542 --> 01:04:47,134
But it sure seems like
we're going

943
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,702
right back to where
we sunk that German ship.

944
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,974
Clear the compartment.

945
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,484
Everybody, give us 5 minutes.

946
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:56,712
Go!

947
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:02,024
All right.
We're almost all set.

we lost power up here.

when the rudder went over?

Huh?

966
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:57,006
This course heads back
to England,

967
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,844
and I've noticed you've had
a hard-on for anything English.

968
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,144
So where were you, O'Dell?

969
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:03,310
Back of the boat... messing with
the rudder assembly?

970
01:06:03,386 --> 01:06:04,512
Or did you get some motormac...

I have ever heard!

as what you're saying!

All I know is what Coors
told me.

1070
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:54,939
And apparently...

1071
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:59,453
Captain Winters wanted to shoot
the German survivors.

1072
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,454
Mr. Brice and Mr. Loomis

1073
01:15:01,522 --> 01:15:06,289
and Mr... Mr. Coors...
wanted to help.

1074
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,261
Apparently Captain Winters
lost the argument.

1075
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,855
Well, that's interesting.

1076
01:15:11,932 --> 01:15:13,695
[Breathes deeply]

1077
01:15:13,768 --> 01:15:18,467
But it's not what I heard...
from Mr. Brice.

1078
01:15:20,841 --> 01:15:23,776
[Breathlessly]
Lieutenant?

1079
01:15:23,844 --> 01:15:26,608
Are you sure he came back here?

1080
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:28,114
BRICE: Looking for me?

1081
01:15:28,182 --> 01:15:29,945
[Gasps]

1082
01:15:30,017 --> 01:15:32,485
I, uh...

1083
01:15:32,553 --> 01:15:37,149
Just... reporting, sir,
that the heating is down.

1084
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:40,557
And, uh...
the bow's levers are stuck.

1085
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,424
Stumbo's working on it
right now.

1086
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,225
And that we show
90 pounds of compressed air

1087
01:15:44,298 --> 01:15:47,734
still left in the system,
and I... wasn't sure

1088
01:15:47,802 --> 01:15:50,669
if you wanted to use that
when we tried to surface

1089
01:15:50,738 --> 01:15:52,672
or use it now
so we can breathe.

1090
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,605

1091
01:15:56,043 --> 01:15:57,237
Sir?

1092
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,474
Running out of shinola, too.

1093
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,447
We also wanted to ask you
about Captain Winters...

1094
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:12,958
whether there was anything
you could tell us

1095
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,517
about what happened that night

1096
01:16:14,595 --> 01:16:16,358
that might help us
to understand...

1097
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:19,763
Don't pretend you don't know.

1098
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:22,428
Just don't pretend anymore.

1099
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:30,640
Well, wasn't that awkward?

1100
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:34,613
STUMBO: Maybe Hoag was right.
Maybe we already bought it.

1101
01:16:34,682 --> 01:16:40,018
If not the depth charge,
then... the hydrogen.

1102
01:16:40,087 --> 01:16:41,952
If not the hydrogen, then...

1103
01:16:42,022 --> 01:16:43,956
[Shudders]
Maybe the cold.

1104
01:16:44,024 --> 01:16:45,184
And if not that,

1105
01:16:45,259 --> 01:16:48,524
then we got a big evil spirit
batting cleanup.

1106
01:16:48,596 --> 01:16:51,190
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on, Stumbo.

1107
01:16:51,265 --> 01:16:54,325
There should only be
so many ways a guy can die.

1108
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:56,460
Listen to me.
CO2 hangs low.

1109
01:16:56,537 --> 01:16:59,370
It starts from the floor up,
and I need you right now...

1110
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,032
- No, no.
- To get up on your feet.

1111
01:17:01,108 --> 01:17:03,133
- Maybe I just need to...
- Stumbo. Stumbo!

1112
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,474
- Let me try.
- We already bought it.

1113
01:17:05,546 --> 01:17:07,036
Come on, Stumbo. Head up.

1114
01:17:07,114 --> 01:17:09,048
- Over and over...
- I need you to sit up.

1115
01:17:09,116 --> 01:17:11,016
- Over and over again.
- Look at me.

1116
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,575
Now look at me.
Look at me.

1117
01:17:12,653 --> 01:17:14,245
- [Panting]
- Good.

1118
01:17:15,956 --> 01:17:17,423
Feel that?

1119
01:17:17,491 --> 01:17:19,322
Well, you're alive, then,
aren't you?

1120
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:20,883
You fuckin'...

1121
01:17:20,961 --> 01:17:22,929
- Stumbo...
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

1122
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:25,488
- Take it easy! Hey!
- Relax, man!

1123
01:17:25,566 --> 01:17:27,329
Stumbo!

1124
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:30,336
Isn't there a winch or a pulley

1125
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:32,497
or maybe a come-along
in a bowsman's locker?

1126
01:17:32,573 --> 01:17:33,665
- Yeah.
- Can't we use that?

1127
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:35,174
You know what he's
talking about, Stumbo?

1128
01:17:35,242 --> 01:17:36,641
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

1129
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:39,201
Come... we need it. Come on.
Show... show me, Stumbo.

1130
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,373
We've got to get it.
Okay, come on. Come on.

1131
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:44,849
[Panting]

1132
01:17:44,919 --> 01:17:47,285
So, tell me
why three officers

1133
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:50,346
would conspire to kill
their captain

1134
01:17:50,424 --> 01:17:52,688
and cover it up.

1135
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,921
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it?

1136
01:17:54,995 --> 01:17:56,587
[Panting]
What if I am?

1137
01:17:56,664 --> 01:17:58,859
I can see I'm not the only one.

1138
01:18:01,435 --> 01:18:04,029
Loomis was up
for a major citation.

1139
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:06,072
And Brice was ready
for his own command.

1140
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,472
He was from a naval family.
He went to Annapolis.

1141
01:18:08,542 --> 01:18:11,010
Coors had this beautiful girl
waiting for him back in Boston

1142
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:12,841
that he was always
talking about, Claire.

1143
01:18:12,913 --> 01:18:15,404
These guys had everything
to live for.

1144
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:19,976
By that reasoning...
they had everything to lose.

1145

[Soft rumbling]

01:18:26,026 --> 01:18:28,290

- No!

1151
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:54,077

1152

1153
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,615

We're running out of plays
in the playbook.

1156
01:19:03,931 --> 01:19:06,695
Do you have... any idea
why the boat is going back

1157
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,634
or how we can get control
of it?

1158

[Panting]

1159
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,032
I've been checking the
literature on this subject.

about maledictions is...

1161

Maledictions?

1162
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:17,770
Look it up.

1163
01:19:17,845 --> 01:19:20,075
Maledictions don't issue
from Heaven or Hell

1164
01:19:20,147 --> 01:19:22,638
but from some unresolved place
in between.

1165
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:24,343

Suffice to say...

1169
01:19:31,759 --> 01:19:36,287
the malediction needs
satisfaction

1170
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:39,127
in order to escape
its netherworld.

1171
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,963
And if you had to guess...

1172
01:19:42,036 --> 01:19:45,631
what would satisfy
our malediction?

1173

Or maybe we're here.

01:28:09,775 --> 01:28:13,370
Wallace, see if you can work the
radar, get a sweep of the area.

1279
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:15,778
Stumbo, see if you can crack
this hatch. Use a crowbar.

1280
01:28:15,848 --> 01:28:17,839
Drain the tower.
See if we can get out that way.

1281

we have contact.

On SJ radar...
4,000 yards, starboard beam.

1286
01:28:45,745 --> 01:28:48,339
It's the same one?
It's the same kraut ship?

1287
01:28:48,414 --> 01:28:50,974
- Are we being choosy?
- All right.

1288
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,642
Uh, Wallace, raise the antenna.

1289
01:28:52,718 --> 01:28:54,447
Issue a radio challenge
on the Ariel-6.

1290

Get the ship I.D.'d
as of right now.

Well done, Mr. O'Dell.

1292
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:07,021
But I'm feeling
much better now.

1293
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:22,911
You were saying?

1294
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:24,643
We have a contact.

1295
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:27,779
That may be an opportunity.

1296
01:29:27,853 --> 01:29:29,753
An opportunity?

1297
01:29:30,823 --> 01:29:32,188
To abandon ship.

1298
01:29:32,258 --> 01:29:35,125
Well, I don't know that
that's a friendly out there.

1299
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:36,286
Well, neither do I.

1300
01:29:36,362 --> 01:29:38,557
But it seems better to scuttle
now and take our chances

1301
01:29:38,631 --> 01:29:40,462
with a surface vessel,
even if it is German.

1302
01:29:40,532 --> 01:29:42,227
Scuttle and tell Connecticut
what?

1303
01:29:42,301 --> 01:29:44,735
We sunk one of their
finest fleet submarines

1304
01:29:44,803 --> 01:29:46,896
because we lost a few men
carrying out our mission?

1305
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:48,599
A few men, sir?

Wallace... no matter what
Mr. Brice says,

1311
01:30:04,556 --> 01:30:06,217
I want you to go
to the radio shack

1312
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:08,954
and establish a voice contact
with that ship immediately.

1313
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:10,393
You are not the skipper
of this ship, Mr. O'Dell!
