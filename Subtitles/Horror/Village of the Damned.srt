[ Softly ]
Oh, god.

864
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,854
- more death.
- survival.

865
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:46,300
Tell us what arrangements
you have made for us.

866
01:26:46,302 --> 01:26:48,835
Well, I haven't
had much time.

867
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:55,475
It is 11:22.
What are you anxious about?

868
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,413
The arrangements.

869
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:02,382
Um... Oh, yes.
Actually, I, uh--

870
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,685
I left my notebook
out in the car.

871
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:08,755
I wonder if somebody could
go out and, uh, get my notebook
from the front seat of my car.

872
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:11,325
David?

873
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,829
No.

874
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:29,443
I am unable to see
what you're thinking.

875
01:27:29,445 --> 01:27:31,612
Well, I'm just--

876
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:34,715
just wondering
who's gonna go out and get
the notebook from my car.

877
01:27:34,717 --> 01:27:36,817
- david.
- no.

You are successfully
blocking your thoughts.

879

You are thinking...
Of a brick wall.

880
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:44,951
Why do you keep
looking at the clock?

881
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,429
David.

882
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,399
Come on.
We're going now.

883
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:01,468
Mother, no.

884
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,750
Take your place.

885
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,765
Stop it! Leave her alone!

886
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:06,767

Take him!

Don't worry, david.

We'll go someplace
where nobody knows who we are.
