00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,410
We've got a death
at the blue ribbon laundry.

188
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,846
It's a bad one.

189
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,882
Sheriff Hughes got called
away to an urgent meeting.

190
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,985
[Delivery man]
I need some help.

191
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,989
What's going on, and how
many did you take this time?

192
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,126
Right side up.
Come on.

193
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,029
Alright, Molly, I'm on the way.
Thanks a lot.

194
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,787
[Crying]

195
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,793
Oh, my god!

196
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,662
Oh, my god!

197
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,332
No!

198
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,300
No!

199
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,905
Sherry, it's O.K.

200
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,073
Get away from me!

201
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,307
Her worries are over.

202
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,310
Get away from me!

203
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,934
Holy shit.

204
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,014
Hello.

205
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,016
Is Mr. Gartley here?

206
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,919
Mr. Gartley
is unavailable.

207
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,889
I'm Stanner.
I'm the foreman.

208
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,291
Mr. Stanner,

209
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,127
I'm, uh...
I'm officer Hunton.

210
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,597
Can you show me what happened, Mr.
Stanner?

211
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,867
Do I have to?

212
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,102
Yeah, you have to.

213
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,606
She's down there. I... I
can't look at it again.

214
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,508
It makes me sick.

215
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,811
She's down there. I can't. I'm sorry.
I can't look at it.

216
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,948
Yeah, right, you can't look.

217
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,057
Run a loose shop, cut
corners... what do you expect?

218
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,393
People get hurt
or killed, right?

219
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,895
And then he can't look.

220
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,564
No, he can't look at it.

221
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,900
Oh.

222
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,034
[Gulp]

223
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,770
Hell of a mess, huh, Johnny?

224
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,506
You know, me and my old camera

225
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,910
were doing this long before
you even came to this town.

226
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,145
Never did get used to it.

227
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,950
[Hunton]
Yeah, right.

228
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh.

229
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,855
[Gulp]

230
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,125
Um... pictureman...

231
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,761
Make sure I get
some copies of that.

232
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,631
Like always.

233
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,634
Have I ever let you down?

234
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,903
Yes.

235
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,844
Oh!

236
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,245
Oh.

237
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,022
Shit.

238
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,625
I feel like it's all my fault.

239
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,929
I just wasn't strong enough.
I tried to help her.

240
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,297
O.K., it's alright.

241
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,834
It's alright. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

242
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,336
It's O.K.

243
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,177
Ex... excuse me.

244
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,279
I know how you feel.

245
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,349
Have you seen that machine?

246
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,551
It makes me sick to my stomach.

247
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,091
These will help.

248
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,494
Mrs. Frawley
used to take 'em.

249
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,372
Oh, keep the bottle.

250
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,673
Thank you.

251
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,945
Annette Gillian.

252
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,548
Uh, John Hunton.
How do you do?

253
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,250
Hi.

254
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,287
Oh, poor Mrs. Frawley.

255
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,456
Oh, god!

256
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,758
[Crying]

257
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,227
[Car approaching]

258
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,809
Hey, what's going on?

259
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,946
Nothing, Johnny. We're here
to settle a safety issue.

260
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,547
What's the emergency, anyway?

261
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,783
There's been an accident
with a speed ironer.

262
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,618
Let's go in.

263
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,350
[Engine starts]

264
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,953
[Man] If the safety
features on this machine

265
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,822
meet state and local standards,

266
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,557
then you may resume operation.

267
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,759
[Hughes] Yes, thank
you, judge bishop.

268
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,795
O.K., Martin,
start her up.

269
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,763
Stand clear, boys.

270
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,771
Let's start with the safety bar.

271
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,206
When I lift this up,

272
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,743
the machine
should stop. Uh!

273
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,513
Put it down, it should start.

274
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,016
What is your conclusion,
Mr. Martin?

275
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,584
Well, I'll tell you,
judge bishop,

276
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,886
the safety bar seems to
be working fine.

277
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,223
Then I declare that this was
a case of accidental death.

278
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,891
This inquest is closed.

279
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,327
[Man] I know what you
think of my work.

280
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,062
Look, there's no such thing

281
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,665
as empirical truth in
theoretical parapsychology.

282
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,734
If you saw Seraphims and Cherubims
falling out of the sky,

283
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,902
singing <i>hallelujah,</i>

284
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,270
you wouldn't believe it.

285
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,473
You want proof, right?

286
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,109
Oh, you'll never change.

287
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,018
You haven't eaten much.

288
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,422
Why? You're not
feeling well?

289
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,023
There was an accident today...

290
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,059
The worst one I've ever seen.

291
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,327
Messy?

292
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,797
[Groan]

293
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,605
So how long is it now

294
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,807
you've been chasing corpses?

295
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,742
14 years.

296
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,045
Oh, man, 14 years.

297
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,582
You know, you need to spend
some more time with the living.

298
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,317
Ha ha ha!

299
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,287
Jesus, you sound
just like Sandy.

300
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,925
Sandra really loved you.

301
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,193
Whatever.

302
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:26,230
Uh, I just... I just
got to hang in there

303
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,066
and get my 20 years in
so I can retire

304
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,102
and get the fuck
out of this town

305
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,271
before I turn completely numb.

306
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,541
Yeah, well, uh,
you know, Johnny,

307
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,343
you really do
need to get a life.

308
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,950
I got a life.

309
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,387
What I need is a beer.

310
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,889
Come over if you want.

311
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,825
I don't suppose you know anything
about industrial laundries?

312
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,461
You know, I used to work
in an industrial laundry

313
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,830
when I was an undergraduate
at Berkeley.

314
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:00,865
Get out of here.

315
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,899
I did, man.

316
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:02,934
Really?

317
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,068
Yeah, sure.

318
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,405
Well, look,
do you know that machine

319
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,873
they call the speed ironer?

320
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,309
Oh, man, yeah. It's
called a mangle.

321
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,610
A mangler?

322
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,744
Mangle.

323
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,848
That's the one.
That's the one.

324
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,551
It mangled a woman
this morning...

325
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,652
Oh!

326
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,589
Over at Mr. Gartley's
blue ribbon laundry.

327
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,227
It...

328
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,229
There was hardly
anything left of her.

329
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,799
No way. No way, man. That can't happen.
You've got a safety bar.

330
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:38,603
If someone's feeding the machine
and get their hand underneath,

331
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,806
the bar snaps up and turns
the damn thing off.

332
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,441
Well, that's how I remember it.

333
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,109
Yeah, it's got a safety bar,

334
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,311
but it happened anyhow.

335
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:51,616
Oh, god. Man,
what a way to go.

336
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,020
I hated that machine.

337
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,104
Oh, fuck me!
I can't do this!

338
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,872
Well, it is what it is, right?

339
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,974
Johnny, don't.
I mean, you can't...

340
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,844
What? A woman's dead, mark.

341
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,382
It folded her like a sheet.

342
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,520
They carried her out
in a basket.

343
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,657
Whose ass is on the line?

344
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,392
Nobody's ass is on the line.

345
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,260
Gartley owns judge bishop.

346
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,862
Judge bishop owns the sheriff.

347
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,498
I mean, it's all dirty.
It's all dirty.

348
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,533
Yeah, but why are you
fighting it, man?

349
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,001
I mean, wake up.

350
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,936
I've been in this
town long enough

351
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,205
to know that there's some
strange shit going on.

352
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,308
It's always been
narrow-minded and corrupt.

353
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,078
Hell, they used to burn witches
just 10 miles from here.

354
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,214
This puritanical ethic
is still hanging over...

355
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,184
Look, don't start
with the sprout-breath

356
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,353
political mystical
bullshit, mark.

357
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:07,224
I'm not in the mood
this evening. Thank you.

358
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,993
The woman's dead,

359
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,063
and that machine
is running right now,

360
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,400
alright, like nothing
happened... business as usual...

361
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,769
6 miles from here...

362
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,804
6 miles.

363
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:20,971
Oh, whatever.

364
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,407
What are you supposed to do
about it, huh?

365
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,276
Have a beer.
That's what I'll do.

of the world on your shoulders?

live a little.

everything in.

Yeah, you're right.

370
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,219
Come on.
Just live a little.

371
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,155
You're going to get a
goddamn nervous breakdown.

372

I'm worried about you.

373
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,159
You want some yogurt?
I got some yogurt.

374
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,494
Is it whole-wheat?

375
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,062
Granola? I got granola.

376
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,864

Uh-uh.

here than on the streets, hmm?

Here, the predators are few.

The benefits are many, hmm?

Hmm? Mmm.

402

your uncle Billy?

I'll tell you,

the one thing worse than
the devil within...

416
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,100

What? What is it?

424
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,930
There's been another
accident at the laundry.

425
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:15,199
A steam hose broke loose
on that machine,

426

it easy, Annette.

ask Annette about the accident.

I don't think she's up to it.

a second opinion.

We was running sheets,

458

and the ironer just blew up.

Mr. Stanner said
there must have been

460
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,635
a surge from the
boiler or something.

ever happened before?

It all started happening

464
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:11,348
when Sherry cut her hand
on one of the clamps.

465

466
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,650
Yeah.

00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,985
Was there blood?

468
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,721
Well, I mean, did she
bleed on the mangler?

469
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:21,024
There was blood everywhere,

470
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,394
and then later...

00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,996

472
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,899

any boyfriends

like that machine

and found it liked it.

Come.

491
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,497
to check the machine. They
railroaded that inquest through.

Now, that's against
the law in my book.

00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,711
So, what do you think?

497
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:48,712

00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,380

important. Come on.

all I'm good for?

no way to treat your brother-in-law.

ends of the earth if I asked.

00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,413
Mark...

547
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:07,184
Check it out.
First there is god,

548
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:10,787
then there's country,
and then there's the law.

549
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,122
Alright?

550
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,891
The rest is bullshit.

551
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,694
O.K.?

552
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,063
This is bullshit, mark.

553
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:24,634
Reality, bullshit.
Bullshit, reality.

554
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,203
This is bullshit.

555
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,053
[Bang]

556
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,129
Aah! Help!

557
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:29,299
Whoa! I got you.
I got you.

558
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,401
Aah!

559
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,437
Aah!

560
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,472
[Stanner] It's O.K.
It's O.K. Shh.

561
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,107
It's alright.
It's alright.

562
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,142
You'll be O.K.
You'll be O.K.

563
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,144
Bring her up here, George.

564
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:44,614
But, Mr. Gartley,
she's hurt, sir.

565
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,484
Mr. Gartley, she needs a doctor.
She needs help.

566
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:50,120
My finger!

567
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,556
Bring her to me.

568
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,191
[Mark]
All spells can be reduced

569
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:55,992
to simple common denominators.

570
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,628
European spells mention
the hand of glory,

571
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,531
and that's real trouble.
Spells need a catalyst...

572
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,934
Either herbal or human or both.

573
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,569
The answer is in that book.

574
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,370
Just go for it!

575
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:11,274
Carry on. Come on. Come on.
Read on, man.

576
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:15,278
Belladonna, hand of glory...

577
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,980
Blood of a virgin!

578
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,782
Now, that's supernatural.

579
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:22,519
Supernatural is a really
misleading word, man.

580
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,655
Witches, demons, spirits...

581
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,190
All part of nature.

582
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,825
Like, um... O.K.

583
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:33,063
A demon is a kind of
energy like electricity...

584
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,865
Or fire.

585
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:39,402
Sometimes it gets out of
control, and people get hurt.

586
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,205
Thought you might
want something to eat.

587
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,740
Thank you.

588
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:47,210
The most powerful spells
always incorporate belladonna.

589
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,411
What is belladonna?

590
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,447
The hand of glory,
or deadly nightshade.

591
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,615
The plant?

592
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,049
Yeah.

593
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,051
And the most common ingredient

594
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,053
in all these spells

595
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:00,157
is, uh, the blood of a virgin.

596
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,831
You must admit the way
Annette describes Sherry,

597
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,833
she sounds the type.

598
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,169
[Laughing]

599
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,771
Oh, come on. Come on.
Go with the flow.

600
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:18,608
Think of the possibilities.
Could be fun, huh?

601
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,878
Alright. Hey, mark,
tell you what.

602
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,680
I'll run right on over

603
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,217
to Sherry Ouelette's house, O.K.?
Knock on the door.

604
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,685
"Sherry? Hi.

605
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,687
"My name is officer John Hunton.

606
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,689
"I'm with the police
department here,

607
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,257
"and I am investigating

608
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,692
"a laundry machine

609
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,094
"with a bad case
of demon possession,

610
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,963
"and I need to examine you

611
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:43,700
to determine whether or
not you're a virgin."

612
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,102
Right?

613
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,104
Mmm... mm-hmm.

614
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,540
Huh?

615
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,542
Mark, I could
just see my report.

616
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,344
They would tar and feather me

617
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,247
and run me out of
this town on a rail.

618
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,782
You think so?

619
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,050
Ha ha ha!

620
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,886
That sounds like a whole
lot of fun to me.

621
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,688
Oh, yeah!
Oh, boy!

622
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,390
Why don't we just go
there and talk to her?

623
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,960
Do it for me.
Come on.

624
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:13,363
[Police radio] Johnny? Johnny,
I got that info for you.

625
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,365
Yeah, Molly, go ahead.

626
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,167
Let's see.
Sherry Ouelette...

627
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:20,971
Parents died in a car
accident on 7-10-83.

628
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,173
William Gartley
is her legal guardian.

629
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,808
Is that it?

630
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,311
Yeah. Who's picking up
the tab for my overtime?

631
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:31,514
Take it out of my pension.
You're the best, Molly.

632
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,017
You got that right.

633
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,538
Oh, man.

634
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,874
So who's going to
pop the ques...

635
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:01,745
You don't say a word.
Right? Not a word.

636
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,985
Far out.
Gothic.

637
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,857
[Rings doorbell]

638
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,828
[Sherry]
Who is it?

639
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,364
Sherry? Hi.
It's officer John Hunton

640
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:25,135
from the police department.

641
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,870
Hi. Remember me?

642
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:27,971
Mm-hmm.

643
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,173
I'm here to ask you
some questions

644
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:34,044
about the accidents that have been
happening at the blue ribbon laundry.

645
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,578
Are you a policeman, too?

646
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,115
No. I'm
a theoretical...

647
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,917
Um, this is mark Jackson.

648
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:45,388
He's a student...
An observer.

649
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,590
Then I guess it's alright.

650
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,064
Thank you.
It won't take long.

651
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,371
Is your uncle here?

652
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,641
I'm alone.

653
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,314
Oh, hey, look at those.

654
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,150
They're beautiful.

655
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,586
Look at that little face!

656
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,288
Are they yours?

657
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,323
No, they're not really mine.

658
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,359
My uncle says they'll
be mine someday.

659
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,194
[Johnny]
Um...

660
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,464
Sherry, I'm really sorry to
disturb you at a time like this.

661
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,766
I just have
a few questions. O.K.?

662
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:31,267
O.K.

663
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,203
[Johnny]
It's O.K.?

664
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,871
Alright.

665
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:39,175
Now, Annette said that you
cut your hand on a clamp.

666
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,578
How did that happen?

667
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,081
Getting out of the
way of that icebox.

668
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,486
These two guys lost control.
I guess it...

669
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,254
It hit the feed belt.

670
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,622
On the mangler?

671
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:57,327
Yeah. Then it bounce off
and almost hit me.

672
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,963
Did this icebox
hit the safety bar?

673
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,765
I think it did.

674
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,134
There were bright
sparks everywhere.

675
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,669
What? Sparks like
a wire had been cut?

676
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,807
I saw a big flash like
lightning or something.

677
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,042
That's it, then.
There it is.

678
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,381
[Sherry crying]

679
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:21,618
I really loved
Mrs. Frawley.

680
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:24,754
Shh.

681
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,190
She was like a mother to me.

682
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,192
I tried to help her.

683
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,194
I pulled as hard as I could,

684
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,662
but I was too weak.

685
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,931
It's O.K.
Sherry, Sherry.

686
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,868
Sherry. Sherry, you're a
very brave young woman.

687
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,170
O.K.?

688
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:41,805
Sherry...
I just want...

689
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,940
Mark!

690
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,142
The icebox hit the safety bar.

691
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,944
That's it.
Thank you very much.

692
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,946
Bye-bye. It was
a short circuit.

693
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,148
That's all there is to it.

694
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,283
Let's go.
Mark! Mark!

695
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,818
Sherry, are you a virgin?

696
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,288
Excuse me?
What is this?

697
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,356
Just get out!

698
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,926
Just get the hell out!

699
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,628
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

700
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,630
I'm right!
I'm right.

701
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,098
She's definitely a virgin.

702
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,434
Jesus Christ! I can't
believe you did that...

703
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,403
Talk to a little girl like that.

704
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,638
God! Have fun? Shit,
I hope you had fun.

705
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,308
It's not a question of fun.
I know I'm right.

706
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,276
Shut up, goddamn it.

707
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:22,812
No more about virgins.

708
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,980
I'm right.

709
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,982
What are you... some
kind of pervert?

710
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,351
Doesn't matter
whether I'm a pervert...

711
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,553
[Siren]

712
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,957
What is this?

713
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,325
Oh, Christ.

714
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,827
What is going on
at Mrs. Smith's house?

715
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,864
Whatever it is, you stay
the hell out of it.

716
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:42,765
[Shouting]

717
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,400
There he is!
There he is!

718
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:45,935
Stop him!

719
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,609
Mark!

720
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,811
Stay in the car.

721
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:55,645
Alright.

722
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,280
You stay in the car!

723
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,048
Alright!
Alright!

724
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,118
Hey, Steele, what is this?

725
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,089
Hi, Johnny. It's really bad.
The boy's suffocated.

726
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:08,091
It's Barry Ellenshaw.
Been missing all day.

727
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,093
Mrs. Smith just learned
10 minutes ago.

728
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:13,496
I found that icebox when
I got here this morning.

729
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,932
He never got in any trouble.

730
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,167
He'd no more play in a
refrigerator than...

731
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,602
Alright.

732
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,338
The boy's dog was barking
outside the icebox.

733
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,340
That's why I had a look inside.

734
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,543
Oh, Barry.

735
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,545
Suffocated, poor kid.

736
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:31,114
He's been missing
since 11:00 this morning.

737
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,883
Come on, honey.

738
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,085
Rest in peace, Barry.

739
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,126
Barry Ellenshaw...
Oh, man.

740
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,661
Poor kid.

741
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,806
Hell of a shame, huh, Johnny?

742
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,809
Get him out of here.

743
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,011
[Man]
Stand back there.

744
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:04,013
[Dog whimpers]

745
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,849
Stand back.

746
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:11,754
No! No!

747
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,856
No! No,
Maryanne. No!

748
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:17,560
[Mrs. ellenshaw] Barry!
Stop! Oh, my baby!

749
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,562
Stay there.
Stay there.

750
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:20,930
No!

751
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,917
[Mrs. ellenshaw]
Barry!

752
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,790
It's not my fault.

753
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,560
I had nothing to do with it.

754
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,795
It was here when I
came home from work.

755
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,997
What?
It's not yours?

756
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:56,032
No. I don't know
where it came from.

757
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,634
[Mark]
Hey, Johnny,

758
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,836
come have a look at this.

759
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,788
Wait a minute.

760
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,823
What? This is
the son of a bitch

761
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,992
that almost hit Sherry?

762
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,194
After it hit the mangler.

763
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,830
[Thud]

764
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,901
Transference.

765
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:35,371
It's transference of evil.

766
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:36,806
[Johnny]
Oh, bullshit.

767
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,808
Evil. Bullshit.

768
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,044
[Bird cooing]

769
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:42,712
Easy.

770
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,016
What?

771
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,751
Shit.

772
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,320
It's alright.

773
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:56,025
It's alright, little baby.

774
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:59,295
It's alright, baby.
Come on.

775
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,597
Aah!
Jeez!

776
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,466
Let go!

777
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:05,968
Aah! Aah!

778
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,507
[Johnny]
Are you alright?

779
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:15,578
Yeah. I think so.
Oh, shit.

780
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,015
Jesus Christ.

781
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:20,817
A hammer...
You got a hammer?

782
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,087
It's in the garage.

783
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,056
[Johnny]
Ow!

784
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,165
Miserable piece of dogfuck!

785
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,450
Goddamn you!

786
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,457
Oh, oh, god.

787
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,765
God!

788
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:12,135
Jesus Christ!

789
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:13,603
God!

790
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,838
Lend not thy sight to idols

791
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,275
nor make gods of thyself!

792
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,837
Nice work, Johnny.

793
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,006
I always knew you had it in you.

794
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:54,010
Where did you learn
to do magic tricks?

795
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:56,078
That was the first ghost

796
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,847
I have ever seen.

797
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:59,248
Thank you, my boy.

798
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,284
Just when you thought
you'd seen it all,

799
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:05,388
life bites you in the ass.

800
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,723
See you later, Johnny.

801
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,026
I'll be waiting for you.

802
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,868
What the fuck was that?

803
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,838
Jesus Christ.

804
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,575
Jesus Christ.

805
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:39,956
[Hammer hits icebox]

806
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,491
Get that thing out of my sight!

807
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:45,595
And burn it...

808
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,263
Then bury it.

809
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:50,066
Drive a fucking stake
through its heart.

810
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,340
[Tire screeching]

811
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,548
[Mark] So, what
do you think now?

812
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,383
[Johnny] Do you
know any priests?

813
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,318
No, man. Do you?

814
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,788
No. I knew
a rabbi one time.

815
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,491
They'd think we're nuts.

816
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,026
We are nuts.

817
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:20,196
It's our play, Johnny.
It's up to us.

818
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,569
Why don't we just
get some dynamite

819
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:29,405
and blow the shit
out of the pig?

820
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,474
Brute force isn't
the answer, man.

821
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:35,411
I mean, a demon may be trapped
in that piece of machinery.

822
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:39,715
There's a chance it could get out,
it would love to get out, to kill

823
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,484
oh, good. Good.

824
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,985
Virgin blood.

825
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:46,188
That's the key. It's got to be.
The trouble is

826
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,623
there's many different
kinds of demons.

827
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,458
I don't know what
we're dealing with.

828
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,761
It could be in the
cycle of bubastis,

829
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,164
pan, Dionysius.

830
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,566
You following me?

831
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,469
No... but go on.

832
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:06,175
I have to isolate
the exact cause.

833
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,011
We have to make sure
that we use the right ritual

834
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,846
because the rites of exorcism...

835
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:14,183
I don't know if you understand
but that's really heavy stuff.

836
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:17,520
That's like controlled
nuclear fission.

837
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:19,855
We make one mistake,
that's it. We're dead.

838
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:22,325
We're destroyed.

839
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:27,763
If you ask me, this is just an
act of random possession.

840
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:32,134
It's got to be.

841
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,272
Hey, mark.

842
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:39,709
I got to do some thinking.

843
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,546
Oh, Johnny,

844
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,848
listen, man,
don't worry, O.K.?

845
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,185
I'm with you 100%,
man, O.K.?

846
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,420
Alright, mark.
That's a relief, man.

847
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,888
100%.

848
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,325
That's real reassuring.

849
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,036
[Engine starts]

850
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:12,608
Belladonna,
demonic possessions...

851
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,510
Oh, I'm having fun.

852
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,678
I'm with you, man.

853
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,347
There are stranger things
in heaven and earth,

854
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:22,084
John Hunton, than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

855
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,352
Ha ha ha!

856
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,850
Hey, Johnny, what do you know?

857
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,752
Not much, Tyrone.

858
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,288
Just going to the morgue.

859
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,726
Whew. Not much.

860
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,956
[Man] Barry, it's
been a hell of a day.

861
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,225
Fix you up in the morning.

862
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:47,870
He's a brave kid, he put up a hell of
a fight, broke his arm in six places.

863
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,773
It was suffocation, right?

864
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,808
Mr. Hunton,

865
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,977
we've been expecting you.

866
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,513
You've come to see
Mrs. Frawley.

867
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,015
She was a real challenge.

868
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,518
I had practically
nothing to go on.

869
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,020
Hardly recognized the
parts... the ones that came in.

870
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:06,889
You look at her now.

871
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:13,729
I think I did a pretty good job, considering
the raw materials I had to work with.

872
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:17,199
Can you keep a secret? I had
to fill up her body with...

873
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,400
I hate secrets.

874
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,201
O.K.

875
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,202
O.K., yeah.

876
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,670
You need to be alone.

877
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,706
You've come to do some thinking.

878
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,040
I'll be in my office.

879
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,909
Okay, I'll call you
if I need anything.

880
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:29,145
She's headed to the
cemetery in the morning.

881
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,913
Until then, she's all yours.

882
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,114
Great, thank you.

883
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:34,116
Oh, her personal possessions.

884
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,684
They're right here.

885
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:36,685
Great.

886
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,320
That's all they brought in.

887
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,321
Cherry tomato?

888
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:43,225
No, thank you.
Bye-bye, now.

889
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,300
Oh, Jesus.

890
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:30,439
You won't mind, will you?

891
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:51,894
Jesus, I got to get a life.

892
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,596
Boo.

893
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,731
Got you.

894
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,266
Very funny.

895
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,806
She looks... pretty good,

896
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:04,640
don't she?

897
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:07,509
Oh, yeah.
She looks great.

898
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,182
Johnny. Johnny!

899
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:16,418
You want to come downstairs?
We'll finish off that gin game

900
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,587
we started three years ago.

901
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,990
I've still got a drop
of that Irish whiskey.

902
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:24,960
You know, I get the feeling
you don't like me anymore.

903
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,895
No.

904
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:31,600
It's my job I don't
like anymore.

905
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,402
Oh.

906
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:36,972
Well, it doesn't
matter much anyway.

907
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:42,911
You won't have to look at my ugly
mug around here much longer.

908
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,680
Why?

909
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:47,449
Don't tell me you're moving
out of this hellhole.

910
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,219
Oh, something like that.

911
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:53,656
The doc says I'm going fast.

912
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:58,961
I'm being
eaten up... inside.

913
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,977
I'm sorry to hear that.

914
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,246
Ah, don't be.

915
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,682
We all have to go sometime.

916
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,620
Johnny, you and I...

917
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:27,823
We share the same ghosts.

918
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,762
To forgive is divine...

919
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:39,868
Especially if you can
forgive yourself.

920
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,842
Oh, did you get pictures
of that icebox?

921
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,243
Oh, yeah.

922
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:52,114
Yeah, I'm off down
to the darkroom now.

923
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,248
What was that?

924
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,750
What?

925
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,452
That ghost.

926
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,222
We live in strange
times, Johnny...

927
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,791
Very strange times.

928
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:06,228
I'll have the photos
ready later tonight.

929
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,563
Come on by.

930
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:10,265
I'll be waiting for you.

931
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,135
You know, I'm 50 points
up on you in that game.

932
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:16,939
I've got an Ace up my
sleeve I'm dying to play.

933
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:21,777
You know where to find me. You're
going to lose to an old hack like me.

934
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,049
Shit.

935
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,790
Fuck.

936
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,828
Aah!

937
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,630
What are you doing?

938
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,064
Where the hell is Gartley?

939
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:57,199
He's out of town.

940
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,433
Yeah, right.

941
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:01,236
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come back here!

942
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:06,642
Hey, stop! Goddamn it,
he's out of town.

943
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,248
Get your hands off of me,
you lying sack of shit.

944
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,918
You want to go downtown?
You want to go downtown?

945
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,153
[Gartley]
Boys! Boys!

946
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,956
All right. Knock it off.

947
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,961
Get out, George.
I'll deal with you later.

948
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:31,233
Come in, Mr. Hunton.
I've been expecting you.

949
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,302
So sorry I missed you earlier.

950
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,037
[Door slams]

951
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,106
You know, Stanner tells me
you're quite the detective.

952
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:41,877
A regular Sherlock Holmes
of the dead, hmm?

953
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,980
Why don't you
shut that thing down

954
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:47,316
before somebody else gets hurt?

955
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,787
What, am I going to
have to shut you down?

956
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:54,623
Tsk tsk tsk. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

957
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,193
Mmm. Bad career move.

958
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,665
Are you threatening me?

959
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,034
Is that a threat?

960
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:09,805
Go on, threaten me. I'll shove
them crutches up your moldy ass.

961
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,178
Ha ha ha!

962
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,447
I like that. Threaten?

963
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,848
Uh-huh.

964
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:24,886
No, no, no. Threaten
is far too... kind a word.

965
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:27,089
This goddamn machine
tried to kill me!

966
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:34,963
Breaking and entering
is a serious crime, <i>officer.</i>

967
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,965
Perhaps I should have
<i>you</i> arrested, hmm?

968
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,102
Yeah. O.K. O.K. Hey. Yeah.
Have me arrested.

969
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:43,805
I'm going to shut you down,
you sick son of a bitch.

970
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:51,913
I will not have you
tamper with my affairs.

971
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,515
I'll have you suspended!

972
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,618
Hey, all your powerful
friends and all your money

973
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,521
don't mean shit to me, Gartley.

974
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:00,822
Ha ha ha!

975
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,359
My power has nothing
to do with money.

976
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,763
Power is energy.
Power is motivation.

977
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:11,033
Power is what
holds things together

978
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,969
when they would
rather fly apart.

979
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,572
It's a complex world
out there, sporty.

980
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:20,542
Many things you
do not understand.

981
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:25,414
But... understand this.

982
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,617
There's a little bit
of me in that machine

983
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,087
and a little bit of it in me.

984
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:35,724
We are the lifeblood
of this town.

985
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,731
Gartley, what are you
talking about?

986
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:46,368
We all have to make sacrifices.

987
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,508
You're right.

988
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:57,479
Everything has its price.

989
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:59,114
Yeah. Yes, it does.

990
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:04,786
Well, do come again. This
has been delightful.

991
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:08,490
And, uh... drive
carefully, won't you?

992
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,764
Fuck you!

993
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,069
What?

994
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,282
That s.O.B.

995
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,385
He thinks he's going to
shut down our machine.

996
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,720
Ha ha ha!

997
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,722
Well, sir, I've been thinking...

998
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:16,792
Maybe it should be shut down.

999
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:24,399
Yeah... how long you
worked here, George?

1000
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,168
15 years.

1001
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,572
15 years. Well, you're...
You're practically

1002
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:33,642
part of our little family,
then, aren't you, hmm?

1003
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:37,879
I assume you'll be helping
us run this town, hmm?

1004
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:44,586
I've known that machine
since I was a little boy.

1005
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,922
My daddy bought it.

1006
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:50,292
Best business decision
he ever made, I'll tell you.

1007
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:53,261
My god,
Mr. Gartley, sir.

1008
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:58,266
That... that machine
killed your daughter.

1009
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:00,569
Look what it's done to you.

1010
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:06,508
Yeah. Sacrifices, George.

1011
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,310
We all have to make them.

1012
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:12,681
Hell, boy. You could say that machine
out there made me what I am.

1013
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:15,550
Mr. Gartley, if you're not
going to deal with it,

1014
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:19,855
then... maybe
I should.

1015
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:24,159
Oh, don't be a fool, George.

1016
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:28,697
Don't throw away
a bright future here.

1017
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:33,034
I'm worried.
Worried, uh...

1018
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,470
It's been troubling me.

1019
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:41,042
Well, George, let your own
conscience be your guide.

1020
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,880
[Bang]

1021
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,906
[Dialing]

1022
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,315
Good evening, Martha.

1023
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:24,586
Bill. Bill Gartley.
Sorry to call so late.

1024
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,390
Let me speak to the good
sheriff, won't you, Martha?

1025
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,891
Thank you.

1026
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:32,527
Evening, Hughes.
Now listen,

1027
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:35,964
I'm having a little problem
with one of the boys.

1028
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:39,334
Yeah. That's the fellow.
That's right.

1029
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:45,440
Now you deal with him.
O.K, nighty-night.

1030
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,276
Fuck him.

1031
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,345
[Hughes]
John?

1032
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,348
What?

1033
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,484
Take some time off.
There's no case here, son.

1034
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:57,819
Take a vacation!

1035
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,388
O.K., Mr. Gartley.

1036
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:03,591
Now you're suspended,
officer Hunton.

1037
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,994
Hey, how much is he
paying you, Hughes?

1038
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,996
O.K., pal.
You're terminated!

1039
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:10,131
And kiss that
pension good-bye.

1040
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,627
How are we feeling,
my dear, hmm?

1041
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:43,498
Strange.
I'm getting sick.

1042
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,538
Are you ready for bed?

1043
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,610
Yes.

1044
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:58,213
No! No.

1045
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,852
There's something
I must show you.

1046
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:05,086
Come.

1047
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,928
Must be here somewhere.

1048
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,430
Aha!

1049
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:16,731
Yeah.

1050
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,875
My baby daughter's
death certificate.

1051
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:29,144
Her passport to hell.

1052
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,912
She was only 16.

1053
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:35,283
Hmm. Well, survival of the
fittest is the way of things.

1054
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,754
I mean, surely, my child,

1055
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,090
you must have noticed
how Rikers valley

1056
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,959
is so ideally perfect, hmm?

1057
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:48,229
There's something I want to show you.
Just a moment here.

1058
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,435
Ah! Ah.

1059
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,446
This... is my contract...

1060
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:09,084
My deal...
With the beast...

1061
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,286
The beast in the machine.

1062
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,726
What's happening to me?

1063
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:21,296
My child,

1064
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:25,300
there's a little piece
of you in the mangler

1065
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:29,471
and the essence of it in you.

1066
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,673
You're one of us now.

1067
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,047
My signature.
See? Hmm?

1068
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:41,950
Oh. Understand now?

1069
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:43,451
Do we?

1070
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,187
Hmm?

1071
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,190
See?

1072
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,266
Welcome to the club.

1073
01:08:58,268 --> 01:09:00,768
Oh, precious.

1074
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,396
Fuck!

1075
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,798
I've been studying, man.
Virgin's blood.

1076
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,968
Definitely virgin's
blood. It's got to be.

1077
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,637
Now, look.

1078
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:39,741
A little holy water,
a smidgen of Eucharist...

1079
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,376
That ought to do it.

1080
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:44,512
We'll read some <i>leviticus.</i>
<i>Christian white magic.</i>

1081
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,080
Listen, I'll tell you the truth.

1082
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:49,450
I was really worried about that
hand of glory... belladonna.

1083
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,819
That's black Ju Ju.
Strong magic.

1084
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,421
Hey, mark?

1085
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:56,658
I looked down this son
of a bitch's throat.

1086
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,993
Holy water ain't going to do it.

1087
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,795
Yeah, well, a demon conjured up

1088
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,531
in conjunction with
the hand of glory can...

1089
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:07,602
I mean, that could eat a stack
of bibles for breakfast,

1090
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:10,572
but we don't have to
worry about that.

1091
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:12,640
Thank god.

1092
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,541
Alright.

1093
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,643
You know, I hope you're right.

1094
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,845
I know I'm right.

1095
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,247
I don't.

1096
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,951
We got to go talk to somebody.

1097
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:23,985
Come on.

1098
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,887
Hold up!

1099
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,422
Damn it, hold up!

1100
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,649
I don't know about this, George.

1101
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,218
What the hell took you so long?

1102
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,454
I'm sorry.

1103
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,756
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

1104
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,791
Yeah. Now, don't start
arguing with me now.

1105
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,628
Go over there, cut all power,
and pull the breakers.

1106
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,830
I'll start on the feeder.

1107
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,281
[Sherry crying]

1108
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,485
Sherry?
What are you doing here?

1109
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:32,487
I have to see my uncle.

1110
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,589
That's not a good idea.
He's very upset.

1111
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,891
I can't work here anymore.

1112
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:40,361
The police came and asked me questions.
I got to speak to him.

1113
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:44,232
Police. That figures.

1114
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:47,135
Just don't go up there.
He's busy.

1115
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:50,305
Lin sue's with him, isn't she?

1116
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:54,309
Sherry, go on home now.

1117
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,511
I have to talk to him.

1118
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,949
Oh, oh, oh. I'm caught!

1119
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,051
Mr. Stanner!

1120
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:06,621
I'm caught!
Help! Aah!

1121
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,523
[Sherry]
Mr. Stanner!

1122
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,659
The fuses! Jesus!

1123
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:12,694
Aah!

1124
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:18,666
Mr. Stanner!
Mr. Stanner!

1125
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:19,600
Aah!

1126
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:22,904
Aah! Turn it off!
Oh, god!

1127
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,811
Aah!

1128
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:31,412
Mr. Gartley!

1129
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:35,983
Aah! Oh, help me!
Help me! Oh, please!

1130
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,018
Please!

1131
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,319
Do something!

1132
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:40,421
Do something?
Do something?

1133
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:41,856
I'll do something.

1134
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,858
I'll dance, that's what I'll do.

1135
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,427
I'll do a little
dance for you, Sherry.

1136
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:48,830
Oh, god. Mr. Gartley!

1137
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,431
A little jig.

1138
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:55,536
I need your help now.

1139
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,606
We're running out
of time. Come on.

1140
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,575
[Sherry screaming]

1141
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,713
Please! Please! Aah!

1142
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,749
Uncle bill, please!

1143
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:11,219
Move like there's no tomorrow.
We're on the clock.

1144
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,187
Aah!

1145
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,790
Do it! Do it!

1146
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:16,724
I can't!

1147
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:21,262
Do it! Do it!
Do it now!

1148
01:13:21,264 --> 01:13:23,464
Oh, Christ.
I can't, George.

1149
01:13:23,466 --> 01:13:28,336
Do it! Aah! Do it!
Do it! Do it!

1150
01:13:28,338 --> 01:13:30,004
Christ!

1151
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,539
Do it!

1152
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,643
[Gartley]
Very good, children.

1153
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:43,351
Come here to your uncle bill.
Sherry! Sherry!

1154
01:13:43,353 --> 01:13:44,919
Oh! Oh!

1155
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,124
[Engine starts]

1156
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:59,100
I used to have all...
The time... in the world.

1157
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,874
Damn her. Damn her.

1158
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,985
Oh! Oh!

1159
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,506
Hey, hey. Hey, man, where
the hell we going?

1160
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:41,876
We're going to
go talk to an old man.

1161
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,816
Oh, no. What
the hell was this?

1162
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,135
No. Take me back.

1163
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:11,739
[Pictureman] Joey, stop! Don't argue.
Just do it.

1164
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:22,884
I was just drinking
my tea, and...

1165
01:15:22,886 --> 01:15:25,052
[Coughing]

1166
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:30,491
You're alright.
You'll be O.K.

1167
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:32,493
You're going to be alright.

1168
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:34,028
You'll be O.K.

1169
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:40,101
Thanks for coming and
visiting me, Johnny.

1170
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:43,604
You made an old man very happy.

1171
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,778
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

1172
01:15:54,783 --> 01:16:00,254
Downstairs...
In my office.

1173
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:03,124
Present for you.

1174
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:07,261
You have to exorcise your demon.

1175
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,166
Don't let it possess your soul.

1176
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,142
Oh.

1177
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,703
Shit!

1178
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,125
[Teapot whistling]

1179
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:40,247
Oh, man.

1180
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,389
[Mark] It wasn't your fault.

1181
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,293
I was driving the car.

1182
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:53,427
Accidents happen.

1183
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:56,831
People make mistakes,
but they carry on.

1184
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,487
Johnny.

1185
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:23,491
Take a look at this.

1186
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,129
This is my present.

1187
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,346
"Maryanne Gartley, daughter
of William Gartley,

She was
16 years old."

01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,925
There's Maryanne.

the old money...

The people who want nothing,
need nothing more...

Power. Power.

1206

What is this?

1207
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,045
Wait a minute.

1208
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:54,014
Everything has its price.
The price of power...

1209
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,785
Gartley said something about...

1210
01:20:57,787 --> 01:20:59,353
No, Gartley said...

1211
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,622
That we all have to
make sacrifices.

1212
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,526
Human sacrifices.

1213
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,462

1216
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:33,020
Hi. Sherry? This is
officer Hunton.

1217
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,956
Mr. Stanner's dead.

1218
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,929
I just went to see my uncle.

1219
01:21:41,931 --> 01:21:43,964
Um, listen, Sherry.

1220
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:45,766
I want you to stay inside.

1221
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:48,435
Want you to stay in
the house. Lock the doors.

1222
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:51,071
You'll be safe as long
as you stay inside.

1223
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,307
What's going on?

1224
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,344
How old are you,
Sherry? 16?

1225
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,514
Really?

1226
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:03,150
Stay inside. Do what
I told you, O.K.?

1227
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:05,152
I'll explain everything
when I get there.

1228

I'll be there as
soon as I can, O.K.?

Today's her birthday.
She's 16.

It's her birthday?

Happy birthday, my child.

Surprised to see
your uncle bill?

1236
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:45,726
What do you want?

1237
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:47,261
Why, you, of course.

1238
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,531
Leave me alone.

1239
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,269
Ohh...

1240
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:58,238
Aren't you going to
blow out your candles?

1241
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,475
Come on.

1242
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,410
Go ahead, Sherry.

1243
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,312
Make a wish.

1244
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,981
I wish you were dead.

Oh, what a waste,

1251
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,994
but then,

1252
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,595
we all...

1253
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:23,697
Have to make sacrifices.

Let go! Save yourself!
It wants me!

1440
01:35:26,655 --> 01:35:27,754
Over my dead body!

1441
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:28,955
Are you crazy?

1442
01:35:28,957 --> 01:35:30,156
No, I'm a policeman.

1443
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:34,294
But it wants me!
It wants me!

1444
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:38,665
Sherry!

1445
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,533
Sherry!

1446
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:41,601
Sherry!

1447
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:45,438
[Screaming]

1448
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,350
Jump!

1449
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:06,659
[Rumbling]

1450
01:36:06,661 --> 01:36:08,061
[Machine hissing]

1451
01:36:08,063 --> 01:36:10,897
Leave her alone, goddamn you!

1452
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:16,736
Leave her alone!

1453
01:36:16,738 --> 01:36:18,772
[Groaning]

1454
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,642
No! Goddamn you!

1455
01:36:22,644 --> 01:36:25,211
Leave her alone!

1456
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:32,852
[Machine gurgling]

1457
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,133
Sherry's alright.

1458
01:37:54,135 --> 01:37:55,768
She's lost a lot of blood,

1459
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:58,471
but she'll recover.

1460
01:37:58,473 --> 01:37:59,706
Thank god.

1461
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:02,508
Mind telling me what happened?

1462
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,049
Yeah, I do mind.

1463
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,354
Can I go see her?

1464
01:38:14,356 --> 01:38:15,688
No.

1465
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:17,724
She's resting.

1466
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:21,060
Maybe tomorrow.

1467
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:29,736
O.K. Thank you,
doctor.

1468
01:38:29,738 --> 01:38:31,571
Thank you.

1469
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:35,041
Tomorrow.

1470

[Wind chimes tinkling]

1471
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:48,247
Morning, officer.

1472
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:50,984
Have a nice day.

1473
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:57,290
[Pictureman]
Dearest Johnny,

1474
01:39:57,292 --> 01:40:00,293
in this envelope
you'll find vital information

1475
01:40:00,295 --> 01:40:02,295
that may save your life.

1476
01:40:02,297 --> 01:40:05,698
The old-timers in Rikers valley
had a saying...

1477
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:09,669
Beware of people
with missing parts.

1478
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,405
There's a piece
of each of them in the demon

1479
01:40:12,407 --> 01:40:16,175
and a dose of the demon
in each of them.

1480
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,244
"Faithfully yours,

1481
01:40:18,246 --> 01:40:22,515
J.J.J. Pictureman."

1482
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,115
[Woman] Herb! I've got a big load
of sheets coming within the hour!

1483
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:57,350
Now, get a move on!

1484
01:40:57,352 --> 01:41:01,054
Come on, ladies!
Move it up!

1485
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:04,390
There's never enough
time around here!

1486
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:06,793
I'm not running a
charity here, herb!

1487
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:09,495
Tell them to get their
lazy asses in gear!

1488
01:41:09,497 --> 01:41:10,496
[John]
Sherry?

1489
01:41:10,498 --> 01:41:13,566
You heard the boss!
Keep moving!

1490
01:41:55,075 --> 01:41:57,276
