- He was ranting.

- Is my son under arrest?

- No, ma'am.
- Then get out. Thank you. Leave.

100

- Well, charge him when he's healed.

get out.

I'm not as eloquent.

104
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:11,555
What happened?

105
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,807
L.A. is not
a pedestrian-friendly city.

106
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,977
- Nick.
- I just tried to beat the light.

107

Why the restraints?

108
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:23,316
I don't know.
Ask the lab coat.

109
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:24,651

can you just leave me alone?

- I'm not trying to help, Travis.

124

- It's none of his business anyway.

125

you here, Mr. Unpleasant.

Fine, Dad.
Force me.

planned for the weekend?

Come on, I'm doing
the best I can.

155

Yeah, but that really
doesn't help.

156

We're all building
a family, okay?

157
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,317
All of us. Now, coming
here to support Nick's

158
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,018
- not the worst thing.
-<i> It's up there.</i>

159
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,821
He's not my friend
and he's not my brother.

160
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,489
He'd be there for you.

161
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,024
He wouldn't have
to be there for me.

162
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,026
Not like that. No.

163
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:32,245

00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,396
Or something resembling love.

175
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,282
Oh, I've got
college counseling today.

176
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:11,901
- Kids have applications due.
- Go.

177
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,737
I've got to find a facility.

178
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,121
Somewhere he's not
already blacklisted.

179
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,207
I can do that.
Stacy can sub.

180
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,875
I can't leave him like this.

181
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:21,911
Leave him with me.
I'll stay.

182
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,464
I'm sorry, babe.

183
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:27,300
Why?
I love you.

184
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:29,252
- Well, you're stupid.
- Mmm.

185
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:30,970
- Because you didn't sign up for this.
- I did.

186
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:32,555
- You didn't sign up for all this.
- Yes, I did.

187
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,891
I signed on for exactly this
when I fell in love with you.

188
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,343
- Don't go sentimental.
- And everything that goes with you.

189
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,313
You just throw up
in your mouth a little?

190
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,982
Yeah, a little bit.

191
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,518
<i>( faint music playing</i>

192
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,958
He's gonna be okay.

193
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,127
- Would you take those off?
- I can hear you.

194
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,796
Would you take them off, please?

195
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,799
"He's going
to be okay."

196
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,967
Yes, he will be.
Thank you.

197
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,521
Well, while he's restrained.

198
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,808
What?

199
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,526
Could you carry some hope
into the discussion?

200
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,144
He's an adult.

201
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:30,113

202

203

All you can do now
is what Nick said.

I'm not cutting off
your brother.

205
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,656
He's worse.

206
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,826
Just needs to get
the junk out of his system.

207
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,545
Okay.

You must be relieved.

So relieved, yeah.

- He's at Temple Hospital.

225
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,423
Travis stayed, so Stacy's
gonna take his classes.

her way out of a paper bag.

- Yeah.
- You sure you want to be here?

Nothing.

Is it Dominic Fratto?

Hey, I could expel you

threshold with that thing.

No, you can't get
your knife back.

in five states.

a virus or a microbe.

- No, people are killing.

less time online, okay?

probably teach that class.

enough to be teaching classes.

- Yeah, Glo was--

yeah, so she was
with me when I scored.

336

She was beside me.

But then--

339
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:02,883
then when I went down...

I don't know if what I saw
came from the powder.

351

That's the thing.

352
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,155
I don't--

353
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,859
and if it didn't
come from the powder,

354
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,362
then it came out of<i> me.</i>

355
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,582
My mind.

356
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:11,001
And if that came out of me,

357
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:15,122
then I'm insane, Travis.

358
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:17,791

No.

Mm...

00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,548
Okay. I need coffee

Travis: <i>Here's your

382

I'll be right back.

Not our step.

Well, I don't compare

I'm not crazy.

Well, you repeat the same behavior

- I went.
- I know, I appreciate it.

No, the shooting gallery.
I found it last night.

What are you talking about?

I don't care.

that whatever he saw
was real or not.

420
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,600
Of course it wasn't.

- We're late again.

Thank you.

00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:06,474
Travis, you cannot enable him.

Well, I don't think
he's lying, though.

Oh, so you think
someone ate someone?

- It's a drug den.

- It was bad.
- Bad things happen there.

<i>What does London--</i>

Put it away.
Russell!

So what about this wolf dog?

00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,721
Does he care about
the man in the story?

502
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:49,556
Hell, no.

503
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:51,342
Hell, no?
Why?

504
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,560
<i>'Cause the man tried</i>
<i>to cut the damn dog open</i>

00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:55,512
<i>to keep his hands warm.</i>
<i>That's gruesome.</i>

506
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:58,315
That's gruesome,
but why would he do that?

507
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,934
To build a fire.

508
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,937
But why? Why would
he build a fire?

509
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,105
( snaps fingers ) Think about it.
Think about it.

510
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:07,658
- Why would he build a fire?
- To not die.

511
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:12,279
Nailed it.
See, man versus nature.

512
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,699
London's trying to teach
us how not to die.

513
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,451
Good analysis, Russell.

you stayed awake in my class.</i>

Artie.

<i>The dog is instinct.</i>

Making a break for it?

533
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,874
- Is he okay?
- Sure.

534
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,794
I'm here for him and for you.

535
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,631
Oh, no, I don't have to.

536
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:56,967
I take my dog out when I want
to, not the other way around.

537

- Oh, I'm the dog?
- You're the dog. Scooch.

538

Um, do you think you could
untie one hand, please?

Come on, it'll be easier.

- He almost died, Travis.

Wait, wait.
Excuse me.

- I'm sorry. What happened?
- His roommate coded.

567

There was a second death on the floor.
It was chaotic.

568
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,763
- You need to find him.
- You need to call the police.

Well, I went there.
I saw.

Maddy, trust me, you
don't want to do this.

I have to see it.
Even if he's not there.

Stay here.
I'll go in.

It's not real.
It can't be real.

717

Cal, the church,
it was a bloodbath.

It was a horror show.

Gloria killed two people.

And I need to get
it out of my head.

Gloria's 90 pounds soaking wet.

- Yeah.
- Barely strong enough to spike a vein.

- I know.
- You're not making any sense, Nicky.

I know, but I saw it, Cal.

01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,842
( engine starts )

878
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:56,693
Travis:
<i>Holy shit.</i>

879
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,779
- Oh, my God.
- Stay here, Nick. Don't move.

880
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,584
Madison:
Calvin?

881
01:01:03,586 --> 01:01:04,952
No, no, no, no.
Mom! Mom!

882
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:07,287
- Calvin, you okay?
- Mom! Mom!

883
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,673
- He'll kill you. Mom!
- Calvin, can you see me?

884
01:01:09,675 --> 01:01:11,542
- Calvin, you're hurt.
- ( growling )

885
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:14,094
- You need help.
- ( snarls )

886
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:16,046
For God's sake!
Are you all right?

887
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,632
<i>Jesus, what--</i>
<i>watch out, Travis.</i>

888
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:21,351
- Calvin!
- ( snarling )

889
01:01:21,353 --> 01:01:23,887
<i>( tires squeal )</i>

890
01:01:28,527 --> 01:01:30,527
Ugh.

891
01:01:33,282 --> 01:01:36,150
Oh.

892
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:39,620
<i>( faint growling )</i>

893
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,372
No, Maddy.

894
01:01:42,374 --> 01:01:44,708
( growling )

895
01:02:07,399 --> 01:02:09,933
( tires squeal )

896
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:18,492
( brakes screech )

897
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:53,727
God.

898
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,403
( snarling )

899
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:25,676
What the hell is happening?

900
01:03:25,678 --> 01:03:27,678
I have no idea.

901
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:42,389
