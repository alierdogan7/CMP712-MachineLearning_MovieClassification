in the ground
under the villages.

153
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,100
So they GPS the location,

154
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,978
bulldoze the homes,
and kill the natives.

158
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,162
March through the jungle
and starve yourself?

Yes. Why?

161
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,793

would speak with such insolence.

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,631
Save it.

178
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,430
We need people who are
serious about making an impact.

179
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,132
Not making jokes.
(SCOFFS)

180
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,717
I am serious.

181
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,428
You're a serious student,
which is fine,

182
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,979
but it's really
not enough.

183
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,398
Well, maybe if you gave
someone a chance to learn,

184
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,317
your organization
might be more effective.

185
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,731
What's the cause you
care about the most?

186
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,407
I mean, they're
all important,

187
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,655
but what keeps
you up at night?

188
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,536
Women's rights in Africa.

189
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,832
But how can a white
girl from the suburbs

190
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,125
go to Africa and tell
a village that FGM is wrong?

191
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,582
Exactly.
I'll tell you how.

192
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,959
You organize a group
and you go there.

193
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,791
And you get
media attention.

194
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,547
Right or wrong,
you need cameras on them.

195
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,595
That's the only way
people change their behavior.

196
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,140
The threat of embarrassment.
You must shame them.

197
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,305
Show me how.

198
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,602
I think you're an
idealist, Justine,

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,899
and you have
good intentions.

200
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,189
But you're not
ready for this.

201
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,612
I am. Let me prove it.

202
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,656
ALEJANDRO: The villages
are here, here and here.

203
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,955
The development is going here.
A few miles from the Yajes.

204
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,000
Ten more miles and
the Yajes village is ruined.

205
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,999
And that's the end of
unmanned civilization.

206
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,163
Justine. Nice of you
to join us.

207
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,790
Late.

208
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,462
Sorry, I got off
at the wrong stop.

209
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,758
It's okay.

210
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,383
We leave Saturday.
We get in one day ahead.

211
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,591
So when the bulldozers arrive,
they're in for a surprise.

212
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,425
Who is behind
the development?

213
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,887
It's a private
corporation in Peru.

214
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,643
They hire ex-military to protect
them and to kill the natives.

215
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,566
So we're going to take on a
private militia with our phones?

216
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,521
No. But we're going
to scare them.

217
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,480
And the Peruvian
Government will notice.

218
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,951
Hi. Sorry. How are we
supposed to stream from the jungle?

219
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,869
ALEJANDRO: They have a satellite.

220
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,073
Our contact will
hack us in.

221
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,954
I have 15 sites
ready to stream

222
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,082
and an army of followers
to tweet when we're uploaded.

223
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,876
Once the construction knows
they're on camera,

224
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,254
everything changes.

225
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,260
Just watch.

226
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,761
Justine.

227
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,470
Are you sure you're here
for the right reasons?

228
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,899
Yeah.

229
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,859
Good.

230
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,194
Be careful. The jungle's
a dangerous place.

231
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,116

232
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,327
Are you going tree hugging
or bulldozer hugging?

233
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,708
We're staging a rally.

234
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,627
They're going to shoot you
and bury the bodies.

235
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,632
Well, then you can
watch my execution,

236
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,881
because we're going to be
streaming the whole thing.

237
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,633
I'm so watching that.

238
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,464
KAYCEE: This sounds insane.

239
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,970
You know there's always
a non-violent way to make your point.

240
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,301
It is non-violent.

241
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,803
It's not violent yet.

242
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,264
But trust me, these workers
see you fucking up their development,

243
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,144
it's gonna get ugly. Fast.

244

It's a school trip,

I'm not going to bother
the ambassador of Peru

253
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,043
to get vaccination tips.

254
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,746
