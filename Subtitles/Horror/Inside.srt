1
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:25,241
My child, my baby.

2
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:29,013
Finally inside me.

3
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,046
Nobody is gonna take him from me.

4
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:34,921
Nobody can hurt him now.

5
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:37,614
Nobody.

6
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:57,266
Matthew.

7
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:42,365
'INSIDE'

8
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:56,242
FOUR MONTHS LATER

9
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:58,445
She's better now.

10
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:04,551
So, Sarah...

11
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,525
Have you picked a name for the baby yet?

12
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,096
All right, We'll be expecting you
tomorrow, at 7.

13
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:18,333
If nothing happens during the night,
we can induce the labor.

14
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,401
Don't worry, Sarah.
Everything is going to be fine.

15
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:29,776
Is there someone that could bring you
tomorrow morning?

16
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:34,988
Normally, we have an ambulance,
But on Christmas eve, maybe...

17
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,214
Yes, someone will bring me here.

18
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,826
Great.

19
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,526
Thank you, doctor. See you tomorrow.

20
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:44,226
Alright.

21
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:47,093
Enjoy your last peaceful night.

22
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,811
It won't last long.

23
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:11,792
I had four children.

24
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,592
I bet it's your first.

25
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,535
The first is terrible.

26
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:29,541
In my case, it took thirteen hours
for my first to be born.

27
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,850
It sucks. I mean it,
I suffered the worst pain ever.

28
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:51,592
He made me go through all that,
but was born dead.

29
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:57,031
You know you can't smoke here.

30
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,074
Everyone around here is a pain in the ass.

31
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,980
Too bad.

32
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:37,036
I must say, after all you've been through,
you shouldn't be working.

33
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:39,941
There's no reason to worry,
just a few burning cars.

34
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:43,215
I'd feel better with you at home,
not taking pictures of riots.

35
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,975
I'll be less paranoid.

36
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:52,222
Jean-Pierre looks decent.
Have you ever...

37
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,950
He's my boss.

38
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:57,326
What a shame.

39
00:07:57,632 --> 00:08:00,465
I was hoping to be introduced
one of these days, you know?

40
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,965
So, what do you want to do?

41
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:11,344
Christmas dinner at my place
or yours?

42
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:13,804
I'm not hungry, Louise.

43
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:15,974
I'm really full.

44
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,689
It's going to be alright now.

45
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,557
Listen, I want to be alone, Louise.

46
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:30,330
Go home, please.

47
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:34,892
Hello?

48
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:38,529
What?

49
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,067
I don't give a damn
if he wants headlines.

50
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,930
I don't give a crap!
You can tell him that.

51
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:51,308
Exactly. So you deal with it.
Explain that to him.

52
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:54,404
It's 'Burning cars and
total chaos' on the frontpage.

53
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,913
That's my headline, end of conversation.
Thank you.

54
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:00,283
Ok. No, nothing.

55
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:02,586
Alright, see you soon.
Merry Christmas.

56
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,457
That bastard...

57
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,328
pisses me off.

58
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,866
The suburbs are burning down
and there's no one there to cover it.

59
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,738
And you, darling, how are you feeling?

60
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,840
It's been hard wihout you there.

61
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,916
They're just a bunch of
bored kids having fun.

62
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:35,153
Well, there are cars on fire,
the cops are on their toes...

63
00:10:35,356 --> 00:10:38,553
My reporters are idiots.
So much for a Merry Christmas, huh?

64
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,463
Be at my house, 6am sharp?

65
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,430
Really?

66
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,975
I think I better...

67
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:59,869
Shorten my Christmas Eve,
so I don't keep the lady waiting.

68
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:05,608
What about you?

69
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:09,053
Will you be with your mom tonight?

70
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:12,859
I couldn't care less for this Christmas.
I rather be alone tonight.

71
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,860
You won't say it again next year.
I can guarantee you that.

72
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,348
No, Louise,
you don't need to come tomorrow.

73
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,415
I've told you I'm well enough alone.

74
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:18,950
We have discussed that already.

75
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:25,123
Then you'll come on Monday.

76
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:31,261
No. Jean-Pierre will pick me up.
We just decided it.

77
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:34,903
I gave him the keys.

78
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,740
No, I'm full.
I'm going to lay down.

79
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,826
Dammit.

80
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:34,771
I can't see a thing.

81
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:43,314
Who is it?

82
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,783
Sorry to bother, but I need help.

83
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,889
Can I make a quick phone call?

84
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,895
- Don't you have a cell phone?
- My battery ran out.

85
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:58,067
- What happened?
- My car broke down in the street corner.

86
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,741
No, I'm sorry, but...

87
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,703
My husband works tomorrow.
He's sleeping already.

88
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,713
I won't make any noise.
It'll just take a minute, I promise.

89
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,842
Please.

90
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,220
No, I'm sorry.

91
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:18,758
Listen, try... try some other house.
There's plenty of people still awake.

92
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:21,619
Please, I'll just take a second.

93
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,195
I don't wanna be alone,
with all that violence.

94
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,895
My husband is sleeping, I told you!

95
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,701
Your husband is not sleeping, Sarah.

96
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:32,166
He is dead.

97
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:34,668
What?

98
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:38,904
Open the door, Sarah.

99
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,848
Who are you?

100
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:45,918
How do you know my name?

101
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,853
Open the door and you'll find out.

102
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:00,462
I'm gonna call the police, you hear me?

103
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:10,261
Alright. Go fuck yourself!

104
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,770
Hello?

105
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,510
There's a strange woman by my door.
Please, hurry up.

106
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:24,508
I don't know what she wants.
She knows my name...

107
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:26,983
She knows everything about me...

108
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:30,089
I'm pregnant!

109
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,935
The police will be here in
five minutes! Just get out!

110
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:30,232
Good evening. Did you call us
about somebody trying to break in?

111
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:32,462
Yes, it was me. Come in.

112
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:36,000
Do you live alone?

113
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,437
Yes.

114
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:41,405
- Another guy afraid to be a father?
- It's not that simple.

115
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:45,550
- Who's this woman?
- I don't know. But she knows my name.

116
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,944
Which is in the mailbox right outside.

117
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,751
She knows things about me.

118
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,284
Are you sure it's a woman?

119
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,577
Have you seen the face, or...

120
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:24,154
No. She stayed in the dark.

121
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:27,622
I tried to take a picture of her,
but this is all I got.

122
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:31,459
Alright. There's not much
we can do with this.

123
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:47,276
There's no one around.
Don't worry, she's gone.

124
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,748
I'll lock you up for tonight.

125
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:55,352
We'll notify the night patrol.

126
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:59,355
We have all our men in service, but...
we'll send a notification.

127
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:03,291
They'll show up during the night
to see if you're ok.

128
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,963
Thank you.

129
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:14,363
- It's very quiet for a Christmas Eve around here.
- It is always like this.

130
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,876
- Good night, m'am.
- Don't worry, she won't return.

131
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:20,006
Have a good night.

132
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:38,456
...November 27, and the accidental death
of two French, sons of immigrants.

133
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:42,828
The riot has spread through the poor
areas of Paris suburbs...

134
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:45,004
and the big cities.

135
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:49,004
A great number of innocent people,
police officers and firemen were injured.

136
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,006
More than 300 communities
were affected...

137
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:55,075
4.900 vehicles have been burned...

138
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:07,519
More than 2.000 imigrants
involved in the riot...

139
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,287
What do you want?
You're pissing me off.

140
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:16,362
Comments from the secretary of interior,
disclosed by the press...

141
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:52,098
Hello, it's me again,
Jean-Pierre.

142
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,069
You must be eating, I guess.

143
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:57,600
Something weird happened tonight...

144
00:25:57,811 --> 00:26:01,110
and I hope tomorrow you can
blow up some pictures for me.

145
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:02,941
All right. See you in the morning.

146
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,857
Sarah?

147
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:40,672
Forgive me. I'm sorry to bother you.

148
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:44,108
Jean-Pierre Montalban,
Sarah's chief-editor.

149
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:21,547
Sarah is going to my
Christmas dinner.

150
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:26,145
I just stoped by to see if she's... I'm
worried about all this violence.

151
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:30,584
She asked me to pick her up...
she gave me the keys... tomorrow morning.

152
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:34,122
Anyway, I see her mother has
arrived before me.

153
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,895
When a daughter needs help,
a mother knows.

154
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:40,296
Sure.

155
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,933
Well, is everything okay?

156
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:45,070
She went to bed an hour ago.

157
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:49,368
I better get going.

158
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,243
See you later.

159
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:55,070
Please, don't go just yet.
Would you have a drink?

160
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:58,273
I was looking forward to meeting you.
Say you'll accept the drink.

161
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:20,763
Sra. Scarangella,
are you excited to become a grandmother?

162
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:25,801
It took hours for her to sleep.
Don't wake her up.

163
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:29,178
Of course, you're right. I'm sorry.

164
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:32,208
It's good she's been holding it together.

165
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:35,751
She's been through a lot because
of the accident. Me too, of course.

166
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:39,123
These last months
have been terrible.

167
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:42,055
But I know this birth will
save us. One more drink?

168
00:36:17,864 --> 00:36:19,559
What the hell

169
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:27,304
My little photographer, always
dropping her pictures around.

170
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:33,201
When did she take this? Any idea?
She called me about it.

171
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:37,907
Really? What did she say?

172
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:42,247
Something was bothering her. It was
a picture she wanted blown up.

173
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:44,013
Blown up?

174
00:36:44,357 --> 00:36:47,019
I'm not sure what,
she wanted...

175
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:50,496
to blow it up or
just make it clearer.

176
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:54,864
That face, for example.

177
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:04,439
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

178
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:07,411
Where's Sarah?

179
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:09,877
Maybe you should tell us who you are.

180
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,685
You just enter people's houses like that?
Lower your voice, Sarah is sleeping.

181
00:37:13,886 --> 00:37:15,717
Where's my daughter?

182
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,295
So, who are you?

183
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:27,465
That's you in the picture.

184
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:34,536
Sarah?

185
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:39,243
Are you all right?

186
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:55,451
Mom.

187
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,792
Mom?

188
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:03,693
Mom!

189
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:09,664
Sarah?

190
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:14,702
Mom!

191
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:22,618
Help!

192
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,521
Help me! Help me!

193
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:31,376
Damn!

194
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:40,569
Who are you?

195
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,819
Open the door!

196
00:44:22,748 --> 00:44:24,045
Open!

197
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:31,888
Open the door!

198
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:43,057
Why me?

199
00:44:51,143 --> 00:44:52,804
I want one.

200
00:44:55,014 --> 00:44:57,744
What kind of man would fuck
a crazy maniac like you?

201
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:04,118
Open up, Sarah!

202
00:45:05,557 --> 00:45:07,422
Don't be afraid.

203
00:45:08,627 --> 00:45:11,926
You don't need this baby anymore.
I'll take care of him.

204
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:19,598
What are you talking about?

205
00:45:47,399 --> 00:45:50,664
Let's stop by to check on
the lady, ok?

206
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:55,533
Then we'll take our lucky guy
to the precint. Mr. AbdeI Shani Essadi.

207
00:45:56,241 --> 00:45:59,506
You got the wrong guy, I swear.
I don't play with molotov cocktails.

208
00:46:00,446 --> 00:46:03,904
And if I'm gonna torch some cars, I'm not
bringing my ID in my wallet.

209
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:45,556
Shit!

210
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:54,125
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't try to mess with me.

211
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:57,959
First, we'll see if
Ms. Scarangella is sleeping...

212
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,695
after that we'll lock this
young fella up...

213
00:47:00,906 --> 00:47:02,897
And go back after his friends.

214
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:06,202
We can't let you spend Christmas Eve
by yourself in jail.

215
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:09,744
Your friends are loose.
We'll bring them to you, so you can party.

216
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:12,007
I don't give a fuck about Christmas!

217
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:15,946
- Okay, you don't celebrate Christmas...
- Excuse me.

218
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,385
Hello? How are you, sweetheart?

219
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,932
- His girl is a pain in the ass.
- Tell me about it.

220
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:33,263
But he's in the car
with the heat on.

221
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:36,165
No. We're getting off duty.

222
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,809
We'll check on some woman
and be back right after.

223
00:47:39,678 --> 00:47:41,236
Yes, I love you. Stop it.

224
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:42,913
- She's giving you a hard time, huh?
- Just a second.

225
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:44,707
Shut up, okay?

226
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:49,453
Not you, I'm talking to a punk
in the car.

227
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:32,295
- Walking through the snow.
- Sra. Scaringella, it's the police.

228
00:48:41,073 --> 00:48:43,041
- Hello, how are you doing?
- Merry Christmas.

229
00:48:43,242 --> 00:48:45,301
We're passing to see if everything's alright.

230
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,308
We've been warned about a
woman disturbing you tonight.

231
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:51,709
No. It's been hours, I'm fine.

232
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:55,345
- Don't hesitate to call if she comes back.
- Sure.

233
00:48:58,624 --> 00:49:00,888
Sorry, what's that noise?

234
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:04,685
It's my old washing machine's coil.

235
00:49:04,896 --> 00:49:06,955
It's cheaper to use it at night, huh?

236
00:49:08,066 --> 00:49:09,829
- Be well.
- Merry Christmas.

237
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:11,935
- See you later.
- Goodbye, officer.

238
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:18,803
Man, a coffee now...

239
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:25,006
No, I'm listening to you.

240
00:50:25,711 --> 00:50:28,646
- Did you forget anything?
- Just a stupid detail.

241
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:35,380
- Just curious about which name he'll have.
- Who?

242
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:36,952
Your child.

243
00:50:38,857 --> 00:50:40,188
Keep an eye on her!

244
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,699
Fuck! Arrest her! Arrest her!

245
00:50:53,905 --> 00:50:56,169
Hands behind your back! On the floor, now!

246
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,977
It's a fucking war zone!

247
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,073
It's the police!

248
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,213
Don't move!

249
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:17,727
Okay, I'm going to remove the scissors.
Don't move.

250
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:26,029
Open the door! Open the door!

251
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,277
No!

252
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:39,748
Good, you can make it.
Open the door.

253
00:51:51,396 --> 00:51:53,193
Open the door!

254
00:51:57,936 --> 00:51:59,528
Oh my God!

255
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,712
Sorry, gotta go.

256
00:52:13,652 --> 00:52:16,314
- You'll have to come along.
- What?

257
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:17,985
Something went wrong.

258
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:29,834
This is police brutality, man.
You're gonna tie me up like a dog?

259
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:31,559
Shut the fuck up and move your ass.

260
00:52:33,338 --> 00:52:35,306
- Hey, wait a second!
- Move.

261
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:52,719
- I wanna get out of here, please!
- Take this!

262
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:56,450
Let me go!

263
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:17,877
- We've got get out of this place!
- Come here!

264
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:21,745
Are you okay?
Stay calm, all right?

265
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:27,354
It's gonna be okay.
You... put yourself together!

266
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:32,291
That's alright, I'll be right back. Wait here.

267
00:53:32,831 --> 00:53:35,823
- You! Do you know how to use this?
- No!

268
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:40,598
Just push the trigger and shoot. Hey!
Just point and squeeze the trigger!

269
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:43,403
- Please, let me get out of here!
- You're coming with me.

270
00:53:43,642 --> 00:53:45,166
I'll be right back, stay here.

271
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:27,985
- What happened?
- Is she gone?

272
00:54:28,186 --> 00:54:30,586
She's gone. She escaped through the window.

273
00:54:31,222 --> 00:54:34,055
- She's still here!
- Calm down!

274
00:54:37,262 --> 00:54:39,992
Do you have a fuse box?
You know where it is?

275
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:42,693
Look at me! Do you know where it is?

276
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,766
Downstairs? Let's go.

277
00:54:46,071 --> 00:54:48,301
Wait, I'm going to give you a gun.

278
00:54:52,877 --> 00:54:54,742
Take this, take it.

279
00:54:56,681 --> 00:54:58,205
Watch out!

280
00:54:58,483 --> 00:55:00,144
Shit!

281
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:02,510
Do you have any bandages?

282
00:55:03,755 --> 00:55:06,622
Here? In the drawer? Hold this!

283
00:55:07,459 --> 00:55:09,689
Hold the flashlight. Take it!

284
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,130
I can't see. Take it.

285
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:21,395
Hold up the light, dammit!

286
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:26,309
That's alright, relax.

287
00:55:27,112 --> 00:55:29,546
- Take off the handcuffs!
- Shut up!

288
00:55:30,048 --> 00:55:32,881
Hold this. Hold the light still!

289
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:37,244
I need to fix it.
Wait for me here.

290
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:40,754
Stay still.

291
00:55:42,027 --> 00:55:45,758
- I killed my mother!
- It's alright, just calm down.

292
00:55:45,964 --> 00:55:48,296
- We've got get out of here!
- Damn!

293
00:55:52,637 --> 00:55:55,629
I'm going to call for backup and
an ambulance, ok?

294
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,330
You'll be fine.

295
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:01,035
Alright.

296
00:56:02,681 --> 00:56:05,775
Ok. Put this on. Can you walk?

297
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:10,185
Wait in the bedroom. Give me your hand.
Give the hand! Help her.

298
00:56:13,258 --> 00:56:15,055
Can you walk?

299
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:21,959
Are you alright? I'll be right back.

300
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:57,859
C'mon, let's go.

301
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,701
Hold the flashlight.

302
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:41,037
Ok, I'll let you go when the
power is back.

303
00:57:41,479 --> 00:57:44,039
When you get out, find
any police officer.

304
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,248
Hold the flashlight,
there's nobody here!

305
00:57:50,588 --> 00:57:52,488
Don't point it at my eyes!

306
00:57:57,328 --> 00:57:58,727
Fuck!

307
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,590
- What?
- The light beam!

308
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,464
What the fuck is this?

309
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:12,835
Go back! Go back!

310
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:37,800
Miss! She is still here!

311
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:42,706
Come on, get up! Get up! Dammit!

312
00:58:47,478 --> 00:58:49,412
Where are the goddamn keys?

313
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:12,714
Sarah.

314
01:06:51,996 --> 01:06:53,861
Where are you, bitch?

315
01:07:32,503 --> 01:07:34,994
Could you kill me again, Sarah?

316
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:46,416
You've killed me once.

317
01:07:51,222 --> 01:07:53,588
My son, my baby.

318
01:07:55,493 --> 01:07:57,518
Finally inside me.

319
01:07:58,095 --> 01:08:00,086
Nobody is taking him away from me.

320
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:02,524
Nobody can hurt him now.

321
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,357
Nobody.

322
01:08:20,918 --> 01:08:23,284
They say there were
no survivors.

323
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,819
Officer?

324
01:09:06,597 --> 01:09:07,962
Officer?

325
01:10:28,412 --> 01:10:30,437
The baby is coming out!

326
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:33,783
The baby...

327
01:10:40,858 --> 01:10:42,348
Mommy!

328
01:10:46,096 --> 01:10:47,654
Calm down.

329
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:50,930
I am here.

330
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:02,943
I think it's stuck!

331
01:12:28,332 --> 01:12:29,890
Mommy!
