1
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,764
Can you go to Putney, mate?

2
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,206
Hey!
Let's go home, asshole.

3
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,980
Take us to the airport.

4
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,632
Fuck it!

5
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,729
I'll see you guys
tomorrow night.

6
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,113
Hello?

7
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,343
She's OK.
She just had a panic attack.

8
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,851
- Let's get her upright.
- Come on. There you go.

9
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,516
<i>- Hello. Welcome to the house. </i>
- What the fuck is going on?

10
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,457
<i>Now if you listen</i>
<i>and you don't speak... </i>

11
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,427
<i>I'm sure all of your questions</i>
<i>will be answered. </i>

12
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:02,332
<i>Now you know how you got here,</i>
<i>but I'm sure you're all wondering... </i>

13
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,461
<i>what you all have in common</i>
<i>to be here... </i>

14
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,129
<i>and most of all why. </i>
<i>Why me?</i>

15
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,804
<i>You can search all you want, but</i>
<i>you'll never find a common thread... </i>

16
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,811
<i>because I have chosen you</i>
<i>quite randomly for who you are... </i>

17
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:19,045
<i>but a little bit more carefully</i>
<i>for what you are. </i>

18
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,186
<i>Now you're probably</i>
<i>wondering right now... </i>

19
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,052
<i>about all those people who are</i>
<i>out there looking for you... </i>

20
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,354
<i>your friends and your family. </i>
<i>Well, please don't bother... </i>

21
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,621
<i>because they've all been</i>
<i>settled with... </i>

22
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,523
<i>quite easily in some cases. </i>

23
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,632
<i>I want you to consider yourselves</i>
<i>to be mice in a laboratory... </i>

24
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,598
<i>rats in a cage if you will... </i>

25
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,471
<i>because this is the ultimate</i>
<i>test of human character. </i>

26
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:48,809
<i>Only here, this test is</i>
<i>purely for entertainment. </i>

27
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,643
<i>My entertainment... </i>

28
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,010
<i>and what is this entertainment,</i>
<i>you must be thinking. </i>

29
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,214
<i>Well, right now I'm</i>
<i>watching you all. </i>

30
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,153
<i>Yes, I'm using seventy five</i>
<i>cameras... </i>

31
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,523
<i>and just as many hidden microphones,</i>
<i>but don't try to find them all... </i>

32
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,697
<i>because you'll never be able to,</i>
<i>but one of you here... </i>

33
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,694
<i>one of you will win</i>
<i>and the one that wins... </i>

34
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,762
<i>will receive five million dollars</i>
<i>for his or her participation. </i>

35
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,335
<i>I'm sure you've all seen</i>
<i>the shows... </i>

36
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,569
<i>but on my show, all you have</i>
<i>to do to win this prize... </i>

37
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,310
<i>is to be the only one to walk</i>
<i>out of this house alive. </i>

38
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,709
<i>You won't be hearing</i>
<i>from me again. </i>

39
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,788
<i>The rest is up to you. </i>

40
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,621
<i>So good luck and may</i>
<i>the best person win. </i>

41
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,963
- Who the fuck was that?
- Fucking hell!

42
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,800
- What's going on?
- It's OK.

43
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,770
- What are we going to do?
- It's OK, it's OK.

44
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,845
- Well, is that it? Have they gone?
- They can't just leave us here.

45
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,276
- Everyone please, let's keep calm.
- Calm my arse!

46
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,178
He's right.
Everybody calm down...

47
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,282
- and let's think this thing out.
- You don't think this is real!

48
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,619
<i>Come on, this has got</i>
<i>to be some kind of joke!</i>

49
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,323
- Pretty sick joke.
- Yeah well, I'm not laughing.

50
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,688
I need to get the fuck
out of here now, man!

51
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,627
I don't think it's a joke.
It's a game maybe.

52
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,927
He told us only one will live.

53
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,229
What does that mean?
What, is someone going to kill us?

54
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,035
- Oh my God.
- No, they aren't going to do that.

55
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,473
Are you deaf? That's what
he just said, one person lives!

56
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,805
If they're not going to
kill us then who is?

57
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,506
- What else can he be talking about?
- How do you know what he's gonna do?

58
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,116
Because they left me
here with this!

59
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,080
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch!

60
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,652
- How the fuck did you get that?
- Relax. I'm a cop.

61
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,858
Great! One of us has a gun
and it's a fucking white cop!

62
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,789
- Oh God, don't say that!
- Oh yeah. That's fair, isn't it?

63
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,257
All of us are supposed
to try and survive...

64
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,522
but the copper's
left with a gun!

65
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,234
This is so fucked!
It's fucked, man!

66
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,471
It kind of puts the odds a little
bit in his favour, doesn't it?

67
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,606
It's kind of bullshit,
that's what it is.

68
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,509
Last time I saw one of those it
was in my little brother's head...

69
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,578
smashing his face in the ground.
He was sixteen!

70
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,741
Yeah?
Well, that wasn't me, was it?

71
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,715
- Well, it don't make a difference.
- This is not the time.

72
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:14,223
Mr. Cop, can you put away your gun?
You're making everybody nervous.

73
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,098
Guys, do we know if we're
alone in here? I mean is it safe?

74
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,737
What do you mean, do you
think there's traps or something?

75
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,108
I think we've got a little bit
more to worry about than that.

76
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,006
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- No, you shut up!

77
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,908
This guy wants us
to kill each other.

78
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,120
- What did you say?
- What was that?

79
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>You want me to spell it out</i>
<i>for you?</i>

80
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,655
This guy wants us to
all kill each other.

81
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,895
- What does that mean?
- He's asking you if you're stupid.

82
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,464
Hey, don't upset him!

83
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,763
You heard the man.
One will survive, five will cry!

84
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,530
Welcome to the show!

85
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,404
I said don't upset everybody!

86
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,034
- They can't do that!
- Come on, lady!

87
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,181
He's going to do whatever
he wants! Am I not right?

88
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,246
Come on, come on Mr. Cop,
don't bullshit people, tell them!

89
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,755
- You're right.
- Thanks!

90
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,221
But I mean the thing is, they
actually can't do this to people.

91
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,191
- Exactly, it's not legal, man!
- Hello!

92
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,496
Anything happens to me,
I'm going to sue the arse off you!

93
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,661
They don't give a shit about that!
They've got that covered too!

94
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,066
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

95
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,208
What's the one gonna do that walks
outta here with 5 million dollars...

96
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,936
tell on them? Tell the cops they
had to kill to get the money?

97
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,446
You'd go down fast and probably
to a psych ward too!

98
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,680
What, do you think he's going
to pay you after you kill for him?

99
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,085
The chances are he's going to kill
you too, you thought about that?

100
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,784
So what do you think we should do
then, Mr. Policeman? Uh?

101
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,560
All sit down and hold hands?
Sing 'Kum bai ya'?

102
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,364
Who knows who's going to do what?
I gotta look out for me, yeah?

103
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,867
Seems like a pretty
good idea to me.

104
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,470
Just sit around and do nothing,
I mean, what's this guy going to do?

105
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,609
- What's he got if he has no show?
- You know what...

106
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,339
it's kinda funny you know so much
about what this guy's going to do...

107
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,381
- and you have a gun, what's up?
- I'll tell you what's up with that!

108
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,552
It seems like I'm the only one here
using my head besides the priest!

109
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,689
You know why they left
me here with this?

110
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,992
In the hopes that I would
pop one of you...

111
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,254
if not all of you.

112
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,365
The problem is they picked the
wrong guy, alright?

113
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,734
'Cause I'm not playing
this game...

114
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,538
not for any amount of money!

115
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,036
- And I will not either.
- Yeah?

116
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,142
I guess we'll have
to see about that.

117
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,784
Maybe someone else will get
that gun and use it to win.

118
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,415
- We could make this energy better.
- Like what?

119
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,056
- Like try to find a way outta here!
- Exactly.

120
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,056
Do you really think he's going
to give us a way out?

121
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,627
Well, we won't know
'til we try, will we?

122
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,160
Whatever!

123
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,765
All you mother fuckers can stay
here if you want, yeah?

124
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,163
This nigger's out!
I ain't being no one's bitch!

125
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,567
Hold on! I've got an idea.

126
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,772
We've got a door there.

127
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,045
Yeah, it comes off.
Come on guys, give me a hand!

128
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,580
Alright, come on,
we can do this together!

129
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,741
Sorry. There's no way I'm picking
that thing up and breaking my back!

130
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,149
Well then, sit on your arse
and shut your fucking hole!

131
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,050
Fine!

132
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,154
OK, ready guys?
On three...

133
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,159
one, two, three.
You got it?

134
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,929
I'll back it up.
You guys walk that way.

135
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,469
Okay.

136
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,444
<i>Alright. On three. </i>

137
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,687
<i>One... </i>

138
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,753
two, three.

139
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,364
<i>- Again!</i>
<i>- Come on!</i>

140
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,395
<i>Everything guys, come on!</i>

141
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,774
<i>- Just keep going!</i>
- Again!

142
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,582
We're fucked!

143
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,085
Son of a bitch!
Forget it!

144
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,733
<i> Jesus!</i>

145
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,510
Nothing. Great!

146
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,211
That gun holds eleven, uh?

147
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,356
- Three shots. Eight left in the gun.
- And?

148
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,186
And... one, two, three, four...

149
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,691
five, six, seven, eight.

150
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,698
You know what?
Give up the bullets, cop!

151
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,495
- Screw you.
- What the fuck did you say?

152
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,330
There's got to be other ways
out of here.

153
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,839
Let's split up and
check the entire house.

154
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,584
Let's look over here.

155
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,293
There are cameras everywhere.

156
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,573
Come on!

157
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,175
- Found something?
<i>- Yeah. </i>

158
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,257
Clear it back, come on.

159
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,091
<i>Come on!</i>

160
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,310
Fuck!

161
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,964
Fucking bastard!

162
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,102
Like the show?

163
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,139
Thank you so much
for your help!

164
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,074
Look at you, sitting there like
the Queen of fucking Sheba!

165
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,443
- Give me that!
- Get your own! Fuck off!

166
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,845
<i>- Shit!</i>
<i>- No way!</i>

167
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,113
One it's not up to you.
It's not a good idea right now!

168
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>I'm locking up the rest. </i>

169
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,389
Who the fuck do you think
you are, anyway?

170
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,597
I think we could have
a little talk.

171
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,325
Did you all forget
what the man said?

172
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,435
Only one of us will get out of here.
Have you thought about that?

173
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,170
Well, I don't think any of us
want to think on that level.

174
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,441
Five million's a lot of money. Some
people will do anything for that.

175
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,537
What, and you two bitches think
you could win over us?

176
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,783
You only weigh about
a hundred pounds.

177
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,018
I'm pretty sure I said
nobody's playing this game.

178
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,347
I don't see anyone giving us
any choices, do you?

179
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,214
This is crap.

180
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,689
How do we know who will do what
for that amount of money?

181
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,931
You know what?
You underestimate people, pal.

182
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,096
- Do I?
- What are you talking about?

183
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,903
You've never seen how shitty people
can get when they're desperate...

184
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,664
and they're backed into a corner
and they don't have a choice?

185
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,708
Look at you!
Typical fucking copper!

186
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,742
Listen, I know I've got good
reason to want five mill right now.

187
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,747
- Reason enough to kill?
- We all have choices here.

188
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,483
There'll be no killing.

189
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,621
Yeah, and anybody does
anything like that...

190
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,792
and I will personally see to it
myself that they're prosecuted.

191
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,120
- This is crazy.
- I'll tell you one thing right now.

192
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,697
I'm going to do everything
in my power...

193
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,095
to make sure nothing
like this even begins.

194
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,094
You hear me?

195
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:26,000
And so we'll wait and we'll see
who will do what. Is that it?

196
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,905
Dinner's served.
Great.

197
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,746
One piece of chicken and one potato
for each, we'll save the rest.

198
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,614
You know what? I'll eat what I want
when I want, thank you.

199
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,153
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear.

200
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,554
I said one piece of chicken
and one potato for each.

201
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,786
Hey, can you quit with this
attitude so we can eat?

202
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,361
Good idea.

203
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,139
This is fucking cold!

204
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,482
Try the potato,
it's even better.

205
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,653
Father, can we pray with you?

206
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,049
Accept our thanks, oh Lord...

207
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,819
for this food to sustain
our life with...

208
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,827
<i>and fill our hearts</i>
<i>with gladness. </i>

209
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,262
<i>And help us, in the midst</i>
<i>of our struggles... </i>

210
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:02,097
<i>to confront one another,</i>
<i>without hatred and bitterness... </i>

211
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,407
<i>and to work together... </i>

212
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:09,339
<i>with forbearance and respect</i>
<i>through Jesus Christ... </i>

213
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,082
our Lord and Saviour.
Amen.

214
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,146
- Amen.
- Amen.

215
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,378
That's touching. Can I get back
to my food now?

216
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,350
Any chance I can get the key
to that drinks cabinet back?

217
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,460
- No chance.
- No liquor, please!

218
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,857
Look, I think that we're old enough
to make that decision ourselves.

219
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,226
- I don't eat meat.
- Cool.

220
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,033
There you go.
Now you're not eating meat.

221
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,867
- Hey, wait!
- Split it up between everyone else.

222
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,839
- Yeah!
- It's going back with the rest.

223
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,208
There you go.

224
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,378
That is so sweet.

225
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,280
It's not her fault
she doesn't eat meat.

226
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,783
Yeah it is!

227
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,956
<i>Anybody else got a problem</i>
<i>with the food?</i>

228
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,921
I do!
This tastes like shit!

229
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,129
How the hell do we know they
haven't put anything in this?

230
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,729
Oh my God! Do you think
they could be poisoning us?

231
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:04,231
I think it's safe to say that
if they wanted us dead...

232
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,936
they'd have done that already
and not waited 'til we ate.

233
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,163
They?
What about one of you lot?

234
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,309
I'm not sure I packed arsenic before
I got snatched off the street.

235
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,013
We should try to keep civil.

236
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,444
I think civil is already
out the window, Father.

237
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,812
We do not even know
each other's names.

238
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,147
My name is
Father Michael Duffy.

239
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,220
Now who might you be?

240
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,420
I'm Jay.

241
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,593
I'm Cynthia and this is
my husband Francis.

242
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,461
- He's a music composer.
- That's enough.

243
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,465
I mean, they don't have
to know any more.

244
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,763
Why, what's wrong with
knowing about each other?

245
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,269
And what do you do?

246
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,806
- I'm...
- She doesn't have to work!

247
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,070
Let's move on.

248
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,478
Max. Clothing designer.

249
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,123
- You're not Max Roy, are you?
- Yeah.

250
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,087
You know, I met you
years ago in New York.

251
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,885
That is so weird.
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

252
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,190
Well, I recognized you.
Claire Levy, yeah?

253
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,060
Claire Levy, everyone!
The big tennis star!

254
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,370
I loved that outfit you wore
at The Open in 1995!

255
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,436
- You know, the one...
- Nobody fucking cares...

256
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,337
- what Martina wore at The Open!
- What did you call me?

257
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,138
Can we move on, please?

258
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,215
I'm Lea. I'm a dancer.
I'm in The Chorus.

259
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,649
- Wow, The Chorus!
- Yeah.

260
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,152
How long have you been
dancing for?

261
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,387
It's not been easy.

262
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,187
How long have you been
playing tennis for, smart arse?

263
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,432
What have you actually won?

264
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,858
And can you tell us
your name?

265
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,300
Shona.

266
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,968
You know what
that is, don't you?

267
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,204
- Yeah, it's a tracking device.
- Then maybe they'll find us?

268
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,715
I'm on parole, man.

269
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,886
If I don't get out of here by
tomorrow, I'm going back to jail.

270
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,553
I had a meeting with
a record label last night.

271
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,755
That's my record deal gone.

272
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,526
Record deal?
Should we know you, superstar?

273
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,730
Well yeah, you should but...

274
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,663
unfortunately everyone
here is white, so...

275
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,805
- So...
- So you can't even dance!

276
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,133
So who's the fucking racist here?
Sorry, Father.

277
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,380
This is great.
Nice dinner.

278
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,313
<i>You should walk with your piece</i>
<i>That's the talk on the streets</i>

279
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,521
<i>I'm at war with that beast</i>
<i>Don't applaud the police</i>

280
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,882
<i>Check on with the fleece</i>
<i>West London to East</i>

281
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,256
<i>I speak tongues like the priest</i>
<i>Get tongues from Caprice</i>

282
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,024
<i>I'm talking to that pussy</i>
<i>With the piece, you should fear me</i>

283
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,530
<i>I love to put holes in police</i>

284
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,136
<i>I'm rowdy</i>
<i>That's why they call me Al B</i>

285
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,467
<i>When I win this five mill</i>
<i>I'll be pushing my Audi, yeah?</i>

286
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,715
What?

287
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,515
Prick!

288
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,843
<i>There's five rooms with</i>
<i>two single beds in each. </i>

289
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,513
<i>And we'll be chosen</i>
<i>by picking names. So... </i>

290
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,754
- I'm not happy about doing this.
- Choose...

291
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,025
- one only.
- I'm not allowed to pick two, am I?

292
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,066
- Fuck!
- No way man, not her!

293
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,168
We agreed that we'd do this.

294
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,169
The happy couple and the priest get
their own and the rest of us pick.

295
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,376
But I didn't think I was going
to get stuck with that, did I?

296
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,578
Shut up, sweetheart.
Eat me!

297
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,838
- Well, there's a ratings winner.
- Jay.

298
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,743
That puts the two of you
together.

299
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,816
No, piss off!
I ain't rooming with him!

300
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,453
- Why, you got a problem with me?
- Yeah I do!

301
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,384
- What is that?
- What do you think, bitch?

302
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,458
- That's just rude!
- You ain't no trophy, honey!

303
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,390
Hey alright, enough!

304
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,893
Fine, now the rooms
are settled...

305
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,961
and I'm going to mine.

306
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,640
Nosey cow!

307
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,574
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Look nice. Where was that?

308
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,746
Not that it's any of your business,
but I was doing a photo shoot.

309
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,477
So you used to be famous,
did you?

310
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,615
- Still am.
- Really?

311
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,921
Looks to me like all you do is get
dressed up and get drunk at parties.

312
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,454
Any loser can do that.

313
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:09,597
Why don't you fuck yourself and keep
your filthy hands out of my shit?

314
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,500
Then don't leave your shit
lying around!

315
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,234
How am I going to last
with only one outfit?

316
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,056
Do you have a family?

317
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,296
I did. I'm divorced.

318
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,029
I got one son and
he's just starting school.

319
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,096
It's not easy
living with a cop.

320
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:03,546
<i>- Are you married?</i>
- No. Too young for that.

321
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,077
I have one child though.

322
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,219
My dog, Ely!

323
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,554
I'm worried about him.

324
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,428
Don't worry about him,
he'll be OK.

325
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,425
He's alone.

326
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,463
<i>Dogs know how to take care</i>
<i>of themselves, you know?</i>

327
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,932
<i>It's like a bad dream. </i>

328
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,660
Look with compassion, Father...

329
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,133
on the whole human family...

330
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,239
and take away our arrogance
and our hatred...

331
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,074
which infects our hearts...

332
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,646
and break down the walls
that separate us...

333
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,585
and unite us in bonds of love...

334
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:25,092
and work through our confusion
and our struggle...

335
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:32,163
to accomplish your purposes
on this Earth.

336
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,901
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

337
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,806
Amen, Father.

338
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,158
<i>There's no room. </i>
<i>It's too hot. </i>

339
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,652
Plus someone's watching.

340
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,899
That's a lot of money.

341
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,874
The kind of money your
family used to have.

342
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm not prepared to kill
to get it back.

343
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,411
Well...

344
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,179
the last few years you haven't been
prepared to do anything about that.

345
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,351
<i>I can't believe you said that!</i>

346
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,992
You haven't made any money
since before we got married!

347
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,366
I'm an artist.

348
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,775
Whatever.

349
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:55,313
<i>You didn't turn the light off. </i>

350
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,779
Happy?

351
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,192
Merci.

352
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,862
Shit!

353
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,265
- Who was just in here?
- What are you talking about?

354
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,301
Somebody was just in here
looking for this!

355
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,633
- Lf it wasn't him it was you!
- Why me?

356
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,776
Because it wasn't one
of the girls, was it?

357
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:27,967
Put that down!

358
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:31,148
- I wouldn't know what to do with it!
- Well, he would!

359
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,542
Would what?

360
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,445
Oh yeah, I get it. All us blacks
are the same, aren't we?

361
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,416
You see him busting a cap
on somebody's ass?

362
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,212
You know, I've had
enough of your shit!

363
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,448
Put away the gun and
let's go now, come on!

364
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,660
- Why is no one asking him?
- Me?

365
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,260
- Yes!
- No, he was with me!

366
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,022
Well, maybe you're just saying
that because he's your husband!

367
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,530
I'm not a liar!

368
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,202
Well, maybe someone else is
in here with us!

369
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,838
- No, it's impossible.
- That only leaves one.

370
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,071
What's everyone coming down
on me for?

371
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,007
- It's not 'cause you're black, mate!
- Listen, what would you know?

372
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,340
- Twenty-year-old white bitch!
- Fuck you!

373
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,675
Shut up!

374
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,784
- What are you two talking about?
- English, speak English!

375
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,012
- What the hell do you care?
- You're not in France now, alright?

376
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:17,490
Please! We must keep our
differences out of the equation.

377
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,821
For you Father, yeah.

378
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,165
Fuck this bullshit! You expect me
to sleep in this house?

379
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,800
It's not going to work,
you know.

380
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:35,034
I know how desperate people get
in these situations. I've seen it.

381
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,270
So have I.

382
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,215
Keep the faith in humankind.

383
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,957
Has someone turned
the heat up in here?

384
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,557
<i>There is no control. </i>

385
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,031
<i>- I've looked all over. </i>
- Great!

386
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,433
None of us understand
what's happening.

387
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,804
None of us know why
we're here or what for...

388
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,140
but we have to accept we're
all reluctant neighbors.

389
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,377
I don't think it's fair we don't
know what you're talking about!

390
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,952
Yeah, what are you plotting?

391
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,421
Listen, I said to you
speak English!

392
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,993
- What did he say?
- What are you so paranoid about?

393
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,391
Just let him speak French.

394
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,567
What do you mean what am I
paranoid about? I got good reason.

395
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,895
Now you see, this is
what I'm talking about.

396
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:39,674
You need to learn to do unto others
as you'd have them do unto you.

397
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,640
Look Father, no offence,
right...

398
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,847
but the second you start quoting
the Bible at me I switch off.

399
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,277
- Amen.
- Speak for yourselves!

400
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,648
No, no, no, no, she's right.

401
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,220
I need to learn to be in touch
with each one of you differently.

402
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,594
The only thing I need to get through
this is in the drinks cabinet.

403
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,796
And some more food.

404
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,260
You know, that's it!

405
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,831
I told you already, speak English!
What's wrong with you?

406
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,832
- Speak English, man!
- What's up, home boy?

407
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,039
What?

408
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,373
Home boy?
What are you talking about?

409
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,907
Hey, wait!
What was that?

410
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,876
- What?
- Listen.

411
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,678
The tag, they found you!

412
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,688
Wait, wait!

413
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,555
What is it?

414
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,894
Over there!

415
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,362
<i>Open up!</i>

416
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,469
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

417
00:40:54,752 --> 00:41:04,093
<i>- Open up! Open up!</i>
<i>- Open the door!</i>

418
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,523
Cover your ears!

419
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,567
Open up!

420
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,475
Help!

421
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,384
- Shut up!
- Open the fucking door!

422
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,541
I don't wanna die!

423
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:47,175
Hey!
Welcome to the party.

424
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,569
Here.

425
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,293
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

426
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:20,707
- I can't stand this music.
- No, I just wanted to get away.

427
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,669
It's crazy.

428
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,440
So you're a dancer.
A Chorus girl?

429
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,386
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,921
I've done a lot of work
for the theatre myself.

431
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:39,191
Really?
Like what?

432
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,865
In Europe mostly.

433
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,363
You know, we do it in quite
a different way there.

434
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:55,708
- I think your wife's really upset.
- Oh yes, she is.

435
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,480
Sorry.

436
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,556
Let me turn this shit off!

437
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,863
It's depressing me.

438
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,092
What's wrong?
Come on!

439
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,968
- Come on!
- Francis is going to see you.

440
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,604
Do you really think
I'm scared of your husband?

441
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,473
He don't take care of his
baby anyway, now come here!

442
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:43,211
<i>- Stop it!</i>
- Come on!

443
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,212
What do you think
you are doing?

444
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,581
- Francis!
- Shut up, right?

445
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,950
- We were just having fun!
- Fun?

446
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,785
What's your problem?

447
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,989
No! No!

448
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,360
Stop it!

449
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,999
No!

450
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:14,273
Stop!

451
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,584
Back off!

452
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,123
Cynthia?

453
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,750
You had to do it,
didn't you?

454
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,487
Listen, they both came at me.

455
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,385
I just tried to push her off me
and she tried...

456
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,892
Shut up!

457
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,429
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

458
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,533
God have mercy on us all.

459
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,215
Shit.

460
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,788
Let's move.

461
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:42,428
I said let's move!
Move!

462
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,428
Is this what you wanted?

463
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,731
Please, for God's sake,
you can stop this now...

464
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,565
<i>before anyone else</i>
<i>has to suffer!</i>

465
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,450
Stay there.

466
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,591
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

467
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,625
You can't do this shit!

468
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,500
My jacket's in there!

469
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,939
I didn't mean to hit
the bitch, man!

470
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,040
She came at me!

471
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:12,029
We're going to start to ration.
He's sent even less food this time.

472
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,808
Good idea.

473
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,170
It's getting hotter in here
all the time.

474
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,213
I know. I need to wash these,
they stink!

475
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,584
My fucking food!

476
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,686
I want my food
and I want it now!

477
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,915
We can't keep doing this
to him.

478
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,787
Yes, we can.
He's a criminal.

479
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,124
Innocent until
proven guilty, officer.

480
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,197
And I found him guilty.

481
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,998
I'm not taking
any more chances.

482
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:46,535
Well then, why should we
even trust each other?

483
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:02,219
- We're rationing some more.
- Of course.

484
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,055
Are you alright, Francis?

485
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,522
Yeah.

486
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,870
- Would you shut the fuck up?
- Fuck you, bitch!

487
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,202
Why don't you come in
here and...

488
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:26,848
- You can't starve him, Jay.
- Why not? It gives us more.

489
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,884
Just give him something!

490
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,021
Fine. I'll give him
what he deserves.

491
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:51,900
Here.

492
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:57,106
Are you fucking taking the piss?
Hey, feed me!

493
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,686
- That's bullshit, man.
- You think so?

494
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,505
Where's the priest?

495
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,811
No!

496
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:50,062
- No! Stop it!
- Fuck you!

497
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,195
Get away!

498
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:55,699
Fucking cop!

499
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,072
Stop!

500
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,306
Get away!

501
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:09,306
I don't know what to do.
I don't know.

502
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,557
<i>They call me</i>
<i>the Lord of Peace... </i>

503
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,625
<i>but I've come to cast wars</i>
<i>and cause divisions... </i>

504
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,559
<i>for only God, the world, can</i>
<i>the world itself be set afire... </i>

505
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,359
<i>for I am the fire,</i>
<i>I am the light... </i>

506
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,504
<i>I am the light that is</i>
<i>above them all. </i>

507
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:45,572
<i>I am the all,</i>
<i>the all is ordained to Me... </i>

508
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,936
<i>and they all came forth</i>
<i>from Me. </i>

509
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,670
<i>Who is near to Me</i>
<i>is near to fire... </i>

510
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,906
<i>and whoever's far from Me</i>
<i>is far from the kingdom. </i>

511
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:59,178
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son</i>
<i>and the Holy Ghost. Amen. </i>

512
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,182
<i>Gird up your loins here now... </i>

513
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,721
<i>which part of the night</i>
<i>the robbers are coming in. </i>

514
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,461
<i>If you want to slay a path for men</i>
<i>take the sword in your hand... </i>

515
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,324
<i>and thrust it through the walls</i>
<i>of your own house first. </i>

516
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,463
In God's name...

517
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:50,330
God help me in my
hour of weakness...

518
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,666
help me find my strength.

519
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,938
In Your blessing, Father.

520
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,850
- Good work!
- What's that supposed to mean?

521
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,679
<i>- Why is there so much more?</i>
<i>- It's a reward. </i>

522
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,049
<i>- For what?</i>
<i>- For killing. </i>

523
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,788
- That can't be why.
- Why else then?

524
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:50,488
- No way, that's awful!
- Who cares why, it's more.

525
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,668
If you don't want that,
I'll have it.

526
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:59,174
No. No you can't
have all that.

527
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,776
I'm bringing him his reward.

528
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,170
That's fair, Father.

529
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:20,593
- What do you want?
- Apparently our friend over there...

530
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,593
was happy with
what you did.

531
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,599
- Yeah.
- Yeah? No shit!

532
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,270
He sent you extra food
and some wine.

533
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,777
Hey, listen.

534
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:39,145
See that shit with
your wife and that...

535
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,714
It was an accident, I know.

536
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,147
Bon appetit.

537
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,227
Come on, come on.

538
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:44,771
'I am the resurrection and
the life', says the Lord...

539
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,635
'And whoever believes in Me,
even though he were dead...

540
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,937
will still live...

541
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:58,418
and whosoever lives and
believes in Me, will never die. '

542
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,651
Blessed be the name
of the Father...

543
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:08,492
the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

544
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,859
He didn't strike me as someone
who wanted to die, Father.

545
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,933
- I just left him.
- Fucking bullshit! He killed him!

546
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,331
No, he hanged himself.
I was in my room eating.

547
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,804
Of course, your wife isn't here
to lie for you this time, is she?

548
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,978
- Shut up! Shut up!
- He did it! He did it!

549
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,805
Come on!
Do something!

550
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,208
Are you going to use that gun ever,
'cause if you're not...

551
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,543
- give it to someone who will!
- No look, the priest keeps the gun!

552
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,847
- Someone here killed him.
- Oh yeah!

553
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:11,025
- Well, maybe he just killed himself!
- Yeah, with your scarf!

554
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,763
Excuse me, you're the one
who gave him his reward!

555
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,591
I won't stand and be mentioned
by anyone, right?

556
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,994
- My wife is dead!
- That's exactly the point!

557
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,932
You think it's his fault which makes
a pretty good case against you!

558
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:24,629
- I'm a good suspect, right?
- Yeah!

559
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,967
- Why don't you suspect him?
- He's a priest!

560
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,437
So what?

561
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:32,272
And you know what, he was a priest
when he came here, but now...

562
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:35,780
I don't trust him, and I don't trust
anyone else in here either!

563
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,385
Well, that's all!
That's the end of it, now stop it!

564
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,519
You must all look
inside yourselves...

565
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,749
and that which you find there
will save you!

566
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,421
Now stop it!

567
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,576
<i>Max!</i>

568
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,178
<i>I'm having a drink</i>
<i>so don't try to stop me!</i>

569
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,246
No, I won't.
I need to talk to you.

570
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,648
I'm very worried.

571
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:35,327
No, no, no, not about him.
I'm worried about the others.

572
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,580
Hey! I told you,
don't touch my fucking stuff!

573
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,649
I'm only trying it on!
It's cheap shit anyway.

574
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,884
Goes to show what
you know, doesn't it?

575
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,388
You think you're so much better
than me, don't you?

576
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,796
You know, all the tacky jewelry
and flashy clothes in the world...

577
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,498
can't change the fact that
you're a skanky little pike!

578
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:11,722
Why don't you clean up
your own shit...

579
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,696
- I'm fed up picking up after you!
- Then don't!

580
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,460
I haven't asked you to
and I don't want you to!

581
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,696
- Don't touch my fucking stuff!
- At least I make a fucking effort!

582
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,535
You haven't lifted a finger
since the first day!

583
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,577
You haven't had to work for anything
in your entire life, have you?

584
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:29,306
Fuck off! You know nothing
about me, nothing!

585
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:33,920
No, you're a spoiled little bitch
and I'm sick of the sight of you!

586
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,549
Don't ever fucking touch me
again or I'll kill you!

587
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,351
Do you understand me?

588
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:45,055
<i>And flush the fucking toilet,</i>
<i>you skanky pig!</i>

589
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,594
You know I hate to say it.

590
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:54,138
Francis, I don't trust him.

591
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:59,410
Claire and Shona,
they're too irrational.

592
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:03,775
Lea, she's so sweet,
but, you...

593
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,180
I think I can still rely
on you.

594
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:11,450
Can I still rely on you, Max?

595
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,640
<i>- So Father, you need my help?</i>
<i>- Yes, I do. </i>

596
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,744
And what may I ask,
is in it for me...

597
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:34,245
portion wise?

598
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,956
- Hi.
- No, no, no.

599
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:50,492
It wouldn't be fair.
It just wouldn't be fair.

600
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,469
Stop!

601
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:58,160
How dare you?
How dare you?

602
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,733
You'll take your portion
and your ration only.

603
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,564
Now put it down!
Now go!

604
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,707
<i>No need to push!</i>

605
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,092
She threatened to kill me.

606
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,067
Let's go.

607
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,843
Now! Go!

608
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:48,742
Lea!

609
01:14:58,393 --> 01:14:59,951
Oh blessed Lord!

610
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,365
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

611
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,677
They won't stop now.

612
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:25,843
It's past dinner time, Father.
Better protect the food.

613
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:30,812
- Should be more this time!
- You heartless bastard!

614
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,418
- What?
- You knew she couldn't take it.

615
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:39,259
- She was weak, you know.
- What have you done?

616
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:44,125
Just for the money,
just to win.

617
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,731
- Even your own wife.
- What?

618
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,366
You believe that? Yeah!

619
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:57,068
Right, shoot me then!
Come on, shoot me!

620
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,142
Shoot me, Father!

621
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:11,984
Shoot me, do it!
Shoot me!

622
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:16,697
Shit! Jesus! Max!

623
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:20,432
Max! My God!

624
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:22,860
Shoot me!

625
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,641
Yeah! You won't shoot me,
I know that!

626
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,301
I've done something awful!

627
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:33,578
She told me that she'd kill me,
I had no other choice!

628
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,682
We can survive
if we stay together!

629
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,318
Food is the key.

630
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,987
What are you going to do,
call the cops? 911?

631
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:45,557
I forgot, the cop is dead.
It's too bad!

632
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:50,460
- You and me, yeah?
- You know the thing is...

633
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,898
what's in it for me?

634
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,936
<i>Give me the gun. </i>

635
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,545
<i>The gun... </i>

636
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,584
Come on Father,
give me the gun!

637
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:22,021
Give me the gun
and end it. I win!

638
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,295
<i>You won't do it!</i>

639
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:31,904
<i>Give me the gun, please!</i>
<i>Give me the gun, let me end this!</i>

640
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,141
Give me the fucking gun!

641
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,544
No, stop!
Stop it now!

642
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,716
She was going to steal
the food!

643
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,348
<i>Let her go!</i>

644
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,619
Don't make me do this!
Please, let her go!

645
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:25,588
No! Let her go!

646
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,790
Don't make me do this!
Let her go!

647
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,074
Oh blessed Father...

648
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:48,408
pray for our sinners now,
at the hour of our death.

649
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:17,044
Please my son, don't.

650
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,937
I'm not your son,
Father Whatever McDuffy!

651
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:35,589
I won. I won!

652
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,863
I won, Father!

653
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,234
<i>I won!</i>

654
01:20:53,448 --> 01:21:00,411
I won. I won!
Hey, Watcher!

655
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,886
Watcher, I won!
I won it!

656
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,820
Look, look!

657
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:12,893
<i>Give me my cash!</i>

658
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:15,395
Give me my money, my cash!

659
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:19,069
Give me my cash!
Hey, Watcher!

660
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:23,205
Hey, Watcher! Hey!
Is there someone here?

661
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:34,114
Is someone here?

662
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:37,018
- Shit.
<i>- Hey, I'm here. </i>

663
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,354
<i>I'm here!</i>

664
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,453
I'm here!

665
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,480
<i>Lea!</i>

666
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,139
Where is she?
Lea!

667
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:06,352
I'll find you!

668
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:21,057
Where is she?
Where can she be?

669
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:25,470
Hey, my Chorus dancer,
where are you?

670
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,470
Where are you?

671
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,294
No!

672
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:46,719
- You're sick!
- Yeah!

673
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,359
I'm going to catch you!

674
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,127
You're a freak!

675
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,762
I won.
