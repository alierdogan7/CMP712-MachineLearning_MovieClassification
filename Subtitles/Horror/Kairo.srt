1
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,968
Change course, Direction, 120 degrees

2
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,836
Roger, hard to port

3
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,068
Hard to port

4
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,846
- I need navigational information
- OK

5
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,344
It all began one day,

6
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,612
without warning,

7
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,175
like this...

8
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,302
Still no answer at Taguchi's?

9
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,033
No

10
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,007
It's been a week,
he must have his reasons

11
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:58,479
It shouldn't take a whole week
to work on that disk

12
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,652
No...

13
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,512
Something's wrong

14
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,183
Maybe I should see if he's OK

15
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,459
I just got the creeps

16
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,187
What?

17
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,891
I don't know,
I just feel like something's wrong

18
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:18,030
Like something's horribly wrong

19
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,352
What's up with Taguchi?

20
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,116
I don't know

21
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,028
If we don't get that disk now,
we're in real trouble

22
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,890
The deadline's tomorrow

23
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,565
I know that

24
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,638
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't heard a thing

25
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,905
I think I'd better go see how he's doing

26
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,349
Taguchi?

27
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:38,066
KAIRO

28
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,373
Hey, you are here

29
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,167
Hey, Michi...

30
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,572
I was worried about you,
you haven't called

31
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,272
Right, sorry

32
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,743
Did you finish working on that disk?

33
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,083
Yeah, it's somewhere in that pile

34
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,689
You OK? Are you sick?

35
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,491
No...

36
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,071
What have you been up to,
all on your Ionesome? We're friends

37
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,867
Yeah... Stuff...

38
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,509
Help yourself to the disk

39
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,475
You ought to label your disks

40
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,386
This is it?

41
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,805
The one marked Work File?

42
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,234
Taguchi?

43
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,334
Michi

44
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,203
Oh, Junco

45
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,574
You OK? Was it awful?

46
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm fine

47
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,444
I'd say it's break time

48
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,189
Oh, I forgot, here

49
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,350
Thanks

50
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,362
It's so upsetting

51
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,304
I don't know what he was
so depressed about

52
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,206
He never said anything,
so what could we have done?

53
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,082
Maybe,

54
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,510
he suddenly just wanted to die

55
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,623
I get that way sometimes

56
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,894
It's so easy to hang yourself

57
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,645
Hey! Why so gloomy?

58
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,144
Oh, sorry

59
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,118
About Taguchi?

60
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,681
It's just... lf only I'd...

61
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,194
He seemed like the Taguchi I know

62
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,064
I never imagined he'd
do something like that

63
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,667
Time to put it behind us
Besides, it wasn't your fault

64
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,277
Yeah...

65
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,047
Say... Would you take a look?

66
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,480
At what?

67
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,882
Taguchi's disk

68
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,126
What is it?

69
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,238
It's Taguchi's place

70
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,304
Is that Taguchi?

71
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,976
Yeah, I think so

72
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,818
Look

73
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,995
What's going on?
Isn't that the same scene?

74
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,959
I can't tell

75
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,860
Hey, look

76
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,798
That's a face...

77
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,334
A reflection

78
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,706
You're right

79
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,207
Can you blow it up?

80
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,142
Let me see...

81
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,333
That was Taguchi, wasn't it?

82
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,635
Sure seems like it

83
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,246
What's going on?

84
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,078
Maybe something strange is going on

85
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,944
Strange?

86
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,312
I don't know

87
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,287
I don't even care anymore

88
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,931
Something's definitely not right

89
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,962
A message in a bottle
launched 10 years ago

90
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,367
by a boy on Tanegashima Island,

91
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,735
was recently discovered

92
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,401
on a beach in Malaysia
some 4,000km away

93
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,876
Hikono Koichi was

94
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,643
a 4th grader
when he sent off his message

95
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,777
Members of a local group,
cleaning up the beach,

96
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,187
a sea turtle habitat,

97
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,089
discovered the bottle by accident

98
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,296
I never imagined it would find its
way to some foreign country

99
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,031
I was shocked to get
an answer after 10 years

100
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,372
The group located Hikono

101
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,566
through his former elementary school

102
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,805
Next, the National Weather Service

103
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,439
forecasts another unseasonably
hot summer, it's the 3rd

104
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,518
for eastern Japan...
for western Japan...

105
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,551
Northern Japan... will...

106
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,324
"Welcome to the Internet"

107
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,401
No, this way. Here, OK

108
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,166
Next, OK

109
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,241
"Have Fun"...OK, I'll have fun

110
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,709
Done "OK"

111
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,081
What's this crap?

112
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,392
Yes, I agree

113
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,367
Next...

114
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,106
What? I guess that's OK

115
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,475
Next again, huh

116
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,346
What?

117
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,753
What the... Oh well...

118
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,403
What the hell...

119
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,985
Hey... this...

120
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,593
Who's... what's...

121
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,089
Would you like to meet a ghost?

122
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,446
Stupid crap!

123
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,231
What the...

124
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,422
Maybe you should change
the size on this batch file

125
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,964
Using the variable?

126
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,165
Yeah

127
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,632
So you'll find its property, right?

128
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,940
On, conventional memory

129
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,044
Right

130
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,940
See

131
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,047
So that's how you do it

132
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,313
Say...

133
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:55,857
Can the internet dial you up itself?

134
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,733
You in computer science?

135
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,831
No, economics, no relation

136
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,910
Huh... Sounds like a hacker

137
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,276
A hacker...

138
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,205
Huh...

139
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,889
It said
"Do you want to meet a ghost?"

140
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,656
Some website like that

141
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,897
A ghost, huh...

142
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,103
Which website was that?

143
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,696
What?

144
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,708
Something about meeting ghosts?

145
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,944
I don't really know
It just appeared last night

146
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,445
Know the address?

147
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,544
What? Um... address?

148
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,980
I see...

149
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,486
Windows?

150
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,918
Yeah

151
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,393
Open the Explorer log...

152
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,494
Oh, no, no, I really don't

153
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,861
know anything about computers

154
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,900
The next time the site shows up,

155
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,098
click on it to bookmark it

156
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,834
Not so fast

157
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,110
Click...

158
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,551
Can you repeat that?

159
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,715
Click on it

160
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:07,890
Click on it to bookmark it

161
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,862
If that doesn't work,

162
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,799
You know the print screen key?

163
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,701
Yeah, this one?

164
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,135
Try pressing it

165
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,238
If it doesn't work...

166
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:30,046
Print screen key

167
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,314
Got it

168
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,751
Let me know?

169
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,022
Sure

170
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,627
See you

171
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,650
Don't bother with that Mom

172
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,621
What? Sure

173
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,560
Are you eating this junk again?

174
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,132
It's not good for you

175
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,901
I'm going now

176
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,608
Have you called your father?

177
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,781
Nope

178
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,511
I see...
but what if you get in trouble?

179
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,247
I can' t rush over

180
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:46,261
It's awkward for me to see him,
but you should

181
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,499
Forget it. He's out of the picture

182
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,092
He lives here in Tokyo

183
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,897
But Tokyo's huge

184
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,771
I know, but...

185
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,064
I'm fine. I've got my friends

186
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,543
You sure?
I guess you'll be alright then

187
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,474
You're so trusting and
get carried away...

188
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,147
Hello

189
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,954
Hello

190
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,029
Help...

191
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,061
Help...

192
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,934
Help...

193
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,365
Who's this?

194
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,965
Help...

195
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:00,854
What is this...

196
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,330
The Forbidden Room

197
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,006
Taguchi?

198
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,077
What happened, Taguchi...?

199
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,948
What?

200
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,844
What am I saying?

201
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,915
What happened to Yabe?

202
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,390
Try his house

203
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,757
No answer

204
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,631
Huh...

205
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,260
I hope nothing's wrong

206
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,340
Oh no, what's he up to?

207
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,801
I've got to go see him

208
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,913
No! Don't go!

209
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,978
He'll turn up He'll come if we wait!

210
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,775
Nothing strange has happened yet

211
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,345
Yeah...

212
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,847
Let's just act normal

213
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,887
Yeah, at least for today

214
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,612
Sorry, I'm late

215
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,249
Sure, sure

216
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,047
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

217
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,949
Hey!

218
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,288
Can you believe? He's ignoring us!

219
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,028
What's going on?

220
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,301
Who cares...

221
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,729
What do I do now?

222
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,272
Click it

223
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,499
And bookmark it

224
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,871
Doesn't work

225
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:05,014
If that doesn't work,
press the print screen key

226
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,548
There

227
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,434
Hi

228
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,042
You're the one...

229
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,842
Um...

230
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,140
Kawashima

231
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,474
Kawashima

232
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,844
Yeah, Kawashima

233
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,818
I'm Karasawa Harue

234
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,022
Harue san, Harue san

235
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,320
How'd it go?

236
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,697
Well, it came back again

237
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,892
Really?

238
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,236
Yeah

239
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,295
And,

240
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,534
I pressed that print screen key...

241
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,480
Right

242
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,775
Can I come over and check it out?

243
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,515
Yeah, sure, absolutely fine

244
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,718
I just need a minute

245
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,313
Um...

246
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,884
What's this?

247
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,155
That? Something we programmed here

248
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,425
If two dots get too close, they die,

249
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:48,298
but if they get too far apart,
they're drawn closer

250
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,135
Huh... what's it for?

251
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:00,641
A miniature model of our world...

252
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:06,586
But only the grad student
who designed it understands it

253
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,537
I wouldn't...

254
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,378
Suggest staring at it too long

255
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,417
Sorry, it's a mess

256
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:42,850
Thank you

257
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,983
There you go

258
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,163
- Have a drink
- Thank you

259
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,234
Getting the data?

260
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,346
Yeah, almost set

261
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:33,338
What got you started on the internet?

262
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,241
Nothing in particular...

263
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,044
You don't like computers, right?

264
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,376
No

265
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,917
Wanted to connect with other people?

266
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:52,695
Maybe... I don't really khow

267
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,322
Everbody else is into it

268
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,802
People don't really connect, you know

269
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,498
What?

270
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,436
Like those dots simulating humans

271
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,376
We all live totally separately

272
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,946
That's how it seems to me

273
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,746
Oh... Huh...

274
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,289
I wonder...

275
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,763
Yabe...

276
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,871
Kudo san

277
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,344
Yes

278
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,175
Can you move these orchids
into the greenhouse?

279
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,112
Yes

280
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,499
Um, boss...

281
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,658
Yes?

282
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,797
Isn't Yabe acting strange?

283
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,598
You think so?

284
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,006
Can I go check on him?

285
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,307
Fine, but...

286
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,777
It might be a waste of time

287
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,752
Words said in friendship with
the best of intentions

288
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,825
always winding up hurting
your friends deeply

289
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,898
And then you wind up getting hurt

290
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,263
Is friendship always that way?

291
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,232
If that's so, what's left?

292
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,705
If I were you...

293
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,811
Who needs friends like that?

294
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,819
A courageous choice in itself

295
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,373
Are you OK?

296
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,651
Did something happen?

297
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,355
If something happened,
let's talk about it

298
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,738
Both Junco and I,

299
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,639
are really worried

300
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,010
I saw...

301
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,347
A face...

302
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,009
What?

303
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,645
A horrible face...

304
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:09,781
I've never seen anything like it...

305
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,321
What are you saying?
What did you see?

306
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,393
The Forbidden Room

307
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,401
Forbidden Room? What's that?

308
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,940
Is that...

309
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,974
The room with the red tape?

310
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,775
Don't dare go in there!

311
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,644
Please,

312
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,422
tell me

313
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,259
What happened?

314
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,868
I'm cold

315
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,839
Yabe...

316
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,579
Are you OK?

317
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,924
"Exit"

318
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,635
Harue

319
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,407
Hi

320
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,173
I don't really use the library much

321
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,147
Couldn't find the way out

322
00:45:59,271 --> 00:46:01,068
Phantoms

323
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:05,403
You're reading this?

324
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:07,171
Yeah

325
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:10,573
Is it related
to your work in the lab?

326
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:14,408
Yeah

327
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,617
Huh...

328
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:21,817
Do you have a minute?

329
00:46:22,194 --> 00:46:25,527
What? Sure

330
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:27,927
Come

331
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:46,917
Isn't it strange?

332
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:50,815
Yeah... sort of...

333
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:02,600
Almost like ghosts, right?

334
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,365
You're right, they're like ghosts

335
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:14,004
Sometimes, these turn up

336
00:47:14,546 --> 00:47:17,709
At first,
they look like the other dots

337
00:47:19,218 --> 00:47:21,049
What are they?

338
00:47:21,587 --> 00:47:22,918
I don't know

339
00:47:24,957 --> 00:47:26,151
A bug?

340
00:47:26,759 --> 00:47:27,919
No

341
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:48,446
That website...

342
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,806
What?

343
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:54,541
Oh, what happened with that?

344
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,284
Nothing... yet...

345
00:47:59,024 --> 00:47:59,820
Huh...

346
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:01,449
But I think they're related...

347
00:48:03,362 --> 00:48:06,297
I'm sure they're related

348
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:08,624
You think?

349
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:24,408
Let me know if anything happens

350
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:25,947
Yeah, sure

351
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,793
Karasawa san

352
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:38,887
I need you to check this

353
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:39,998
Yes

354
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:42,397
And you are?

355
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:44,835
My friend, Kawashima

356
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:46,365
Huh...

357
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:48,799
The grad student, Yoshizaki san

358
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:50,939
Hello

359
00:49:11,964 --> 00:49:14,831
I forgot to give you my number

360
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:16,499
Oh, right

361
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:17,863
Call me, OK?

362
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:20,229
Right

363
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:21,669
Anytime, OK?

364
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:22,874
Yeah

365
00:49:23,342 --> 00:49:24,309
Thank you

366
00:49:29,448 --> 00:49:34,511
"Everyone dies, therefore there's no
logical reason for ghosts not to exist

367
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,816
"How many ghosts have...

368
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:43,222
existed since prehistoric times?"

369
00:50:00,412 --> 00:50:01,674
Do you see it too?

370
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,552
Sure you do,
because it's really there

371
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:13,356
Who is that?

372
00:50:14,426 --> 00:50:16,951
You'll have to catch him to find out

373
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:21,931
Start right now,
and you might succeed

374
00:50:26,505 --> 00:50:27,904
Have a go?

375
00:50:28,707 --> 00:50:29,833
What?

376
00:50:30,342 --> 00:50:33,277
Why don't you, right now?

377
00:51:19,624 --> 00:51:21,216
He disappeared

378
00:51:21,827 --> 00:51:22,919
I see

379
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:29,098
He must be a student...
I don't know him

380
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:34,170
Maybe you're right.
Sorry I encouraged you

381
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,505
See you

382
00:51:39,644 --> 00:51:41,305
Wait a minute

383
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,908
Just what was that?

384
00:52:05,537 --> 00:52:06,970
I'm cold...

385
00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:25,213
The spirit...

386
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:29,616
Or consciousness, the soul,
whatever you want to call it,

387
00:52:29,828 --> 00:52:34,231
it turns out the realm they
inhabit has a finite capacity

388
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,500
Whether that capacity
accommodates billions or trillions,

389
00:52:40,272 --> 00:52:42,638
eventually, it will run out of space

390
00:52:43,675 --> 00:52:47,475
Once it's filled to the brim,

391
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:51,271
it's got to overflow
somehow, somewhere

392
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:53,544
But where?

393
00:52:56,154 --> 00:52:58,213
The souls have no choice

394
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:01,689
but to ooze into another realm,
that is to say, our world

395
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,894
Maybe, at first...

396
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:08,994
it started with
something really simple

397
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:34,884
Once that realm
reached critical mass,

398
00:53:35,193 --> 00:53:37,787
any device would have sufficed

399
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:42,531
Thrown it together with
the means and materials at hand

400
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,392
That's how I see it

401
00:53:44,769 --> 00:53:48,466
Excuse me, do you have any tape?

402
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:52,505
Anything'll do, some tape

403
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:55,306
How's this?

404
00:53:56,414 --> 00:53:57,403
Thank you

405
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:31,707
After many hours or days,

406
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:35,678
or many weeks, it finally happens

407
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:29,298
Through that process,
it spreads around the world

408
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:33,303
But now they're no longer
the faint presence they began as

409
00:55:35,213 --> 00:55:36,874
You saw one yourself

410
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:44,283
I don't believe your stories

411
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:47,582
Right, sorry, it's all hypothetical

412
00:55:52,764 --> 00:55:54,129
Thanks for the tea

413
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:55,627
Are you OK?

414
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:57,098
Just fine

415
00:55:58,069 --> 00:56:00,401
But if this really happened,

416
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:02,764
there's no turning back

417
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:06,667
No matter how simple the device,

418
00:56:06,878 --> 00:56:11,247
once the system's complete,
it'll function on its own,

419
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,379
and become permanent

420
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:15,412
In other words,

421
00:56:15,887 --> 00:56:19,288
the passage is now open...
that's how it looks

422
00:56:50,922 --> 00:56:52,822
Hello

423
00:56:53,325 --> 00:56:56,385
Oh, I see, our boss isn't there?

424
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,555
Yes, I understand

425
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:02,232
If he does stop by,

426
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:05,825
Will you please ask him to call us?

427
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:09,201
Yes, thank you very much

428
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,611
Michi,

429
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,377
what do you think is going on?

430
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:30,460
Why's everyone disappearing?

431
00:57:46,611 --> 00:57:49,944
Oh, hello, this is
Sunny Plant Sales calling

432
00:57:51,015 --> 00:57:52,949
Thank you for your business

433
00:57:53,284 --> 00:57:56,913
Is our boss there
with you by any chance?

434
00:57:58,823 --> 00:58:02,953
Oh, I see... Thank you, and excuse me

435
00:58:07,165 --> 00:58:08,393
I'll go look for him

436
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,168
Wait, Junco, wait

437
00:58:17,575 --> 00:58:18,735
Yes, hello...

438
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,343
Boss?

439
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:27,713
Help

440
00:58:29,053 --> 00:58:30,213
Yabe!

441
00:58:32,424 --> 00:58:33,948
Are you Yabe?

442
00:58:37,095 --> 00:58:38,528
Yabe!

443
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,102
Help me...

444
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:09,249
Help me...

445
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:19,298
Help...

446
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:25,902
Help...

447
00:59:34,752 --> 00:59:36,185
Junco...

448
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:39,583
Junco!

449
01:00:15,093 --> 01:00:17,527
Junco, no!

450
01:00:20,932 --> 01:00:22,194
Junco!

451
01:00:26,638 --> 01:00:28,469
Are you OK?

452
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:31,274
Are you OK?

453
01:01:55,827 --> 01:01:59,820
Help me...

454
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:04,659
Help me...

455
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,702
Help me...

456
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,204
Junco!

457
01:02:10,008 --> 01:02:13,000
Look, I'm right here

458
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:16,073
I'm right here, it's OK

459
01:02:40,738 --> 01:02:41,898
Excuse me

460
01:03:13,638 --> 01:03:16,732
Karasawa Harue tel: 090-4079-2677

461
01:06:00,171 --> 01:06:03,231
What are you doing, Harue?

462
01:06:05,243 --> 01:06:07,643
You're dripping wet!

463
01:06:08,145 --> 01:06:10,875
They went away...

464
01:06:11,082 --> 01:06:13,277
They've all disappeared...
They always do...

465
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:14,884
I have to run away...

466
01:06:15,853 --> 01:06:17,184
Run away somewhere...

467
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:24,584
Harue! Hey, Harue!

468
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:28,658
Listen, Harue! Harue!

469
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,625
Calm down! Harue!

470
01:06:53,224 --> 01:06:54,191
Thank you...

471
01:07:24,922 --> 01:07:26,787
I always wondered
what it's like to die...

472
01:07:26,924 --> 01:07:31,418
From when I was really little...

473
01:07:33,864 --> 01:07:35,491
I was always alone

474
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:38,233
Any parents or family?

475
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:42,134
Sure, but they're irrelevant

476
01:07:43,774 --> 01:07:44,866
Right...

477
01:07:48,813 --> 01:07:50,371
That after death,

478
01:07:50,815 --> 01:07:54,114
you live happily with
everyone over there

479
01:07:54,385 --> 01:07:56,717
Can we stop talking about this?

480
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:58,444
But it may be true

481
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:02,151
Sure, but...

482
01:08:03,828 --> 01:08:06,729
Then in high school it dawned on me

483
01:08:09,233 --> 01:08:12,100
you might be all alone
after death, too

484
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,304
There's no way to know

485
01:08:18,576 --> 01:08:20,237
How could you?

486
01:08:20,778 --> 01:08:24,077
The idea was so terrifying

487
01:08:25,049 --> 01:08:27,540
I couldn't even bear it

488
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,518
That nothing changes with death,

489
01:08:31,655 --> 01:08:33,816
just right now, forever

490
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:44,259
Is that what becoming
a ghost is about?

491
01:08:45,903 --> 01:08:49,202
You can't mess with that
It's really bad

492
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:52,774
What have ghosts got to do with us?

493
01:08:52,943 --> 01:08:54,706
Besides, we're alive

494
01:08:57,448 --> 01:09:00,042
Then, who are they?

495
01:09:07,992 --> 01:09:10,483
Are they really alive?

496
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:15,164
How are they different from ghosts?

497
01:09:24,675 --> 01:09:26,040
In fact,

498
01:09:27,178 --> 01:09:29,510
ghosts and people are the same,

499
01:09:30,915 --> 01:09:33,213
whether they're dead or alive

500
01:09:37,955 --> 01:09:41,220
It's not right. It's wrong

501
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:43,326
They're all crazy

502
01:09:45,996 --> 01:09:49,022
Nobody knows
what happens when you die

503
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:53,159
All this about ghosts, but I won't
believe in them, even if I see one

504
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:55,628
But I do know

505
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:01,408
that I'm definitely alive
and so are you, Harue

506
01:10:01,612 --> 01:10:03,341
That's for sure, right?

507
01:10:04,915 --> 01:10:09,648
So I don't want to think about
the fact we'll die someday

508
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:13,718
Just maybe...

509
01:10:13,858 --> 01:10:17,225
In 10 years, or at least
while we're still alive,

510
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,325
they'll invent a drug
that prevents death

511
01:10:20,464 --> 01:10:23,661
Then, we could live forever and ever

512
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:28,504
Of course you might think
I'm crazy to say that, but...

513
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:30,768
I'd rather bet on that

514
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,937
You want to live forever?

515
01:10:35,913 --> 01:10:37,005
Yeah

516
01:10:38,482 --> 01:10:39,972
That sounds like fun?

517
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:43,619
Yeah... That's what I think

518
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:54,192
Huh... Maybe I've got it all wrong

519
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:00,402
No...

520
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:06,171
It'll turn out just like you say

521
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:09,972
I'm sure

522
01:11:10,915 --> 01:11:12,075
What?

523
01:11:15,786 --> 01:11:18,687
Ghosts won't kill people

524
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:23,283
Because that would just
make more ghosts

525
01:11:25,462 --> 01:11:26,759
Isn't that right?

526
01:11:30,568 --> 01:11:34,504
Instead, they'll try
to make people immortal

527
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,206
By quietly...

528
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,839
trapping them in their own Ioneliness

529
01:11:55,593 --> 01:11:57,322
Help...

530
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:01,596
Help...

531
01:13:05,796 --> 01:13:09,323
Junco, It'll be OK

532
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:11,801
It'll be OK

533
01:13:12,469 --> 01:13:14,460
OK...

534
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:34,583
I fell asleep...

535
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:40,696
How do you feel?

536
01:13:41,098 --> 01:13:42,224
Yeah

537
01:13:43,567 --> 01:13:46,559
Something to drink?
How about some coffee?

538
01:14:00,484 --> 01:14:01,382
Michi...

539
01:14:02,286 --> 01:14:03,446
What?

540
01:14:06,023 --> 01:14:08,787
Am I just going to die like this?

541
01:14:10,928 --> 01:14:12,691
Of course not

542
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:16,263
That's right...

543
01:14:17,301 --> 01:14:19,633
I'll just keep on living,
all alone...

544
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,384
What?

545
01:14:44,895 --> 01:14:46,260
No

546
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,724
Junco!

547
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,490
Junco!

548
01:15:25,969 --> 01:15:27,459
Junco!

549
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,051
Junco!

550
01:15:50,027 --> 01:15:51,585
Why! Why!

551
01:16:01,071 --> 01:16:04,006
Junco, don't go!

552
01:16:04,475 --> 01:16:06,102
Junco!

553
01:16:56,326 --> 01:16:57,657
Mother?

554
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:03,260
Mother?

555
01:17:05,936 --> 01:17:07,733
Mother!

556
01:17:13,443 --> 01:17:14,637
I'll be right there

557
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,392
Harue...

558
01:19:56,073 --> 01:19:58,064
Harue! Hey...

559
01:20:02,612 --> 01:20:06,480
Kawashima... take me with you

560
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:13,851
I'm scared to be alone

561
01:20:18,995 --> 01:20:20,895
Take me somewhere

562
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:35,911
OK, sure

563
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:39,073
Where to?

564
01:20:39,282 --> 01:20:40,749
Somewhere far away

565
01:20:42,352 --> 01:20:44,013
Out of Order

566
01:20:44,354 --> 01:20:47,323
Shit, let's just go!

567
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,129
There's no one...

568
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:32,561
No...

569
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:41,139
Where did everyone go?

570
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:47,411
I'm here

571
01:21:52,856 --> 01:21:54,687
I'm here beside you

572
01:22:00,063 --> 01:22:04,022
Even if,

573
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:05,826
there's no one else, it doesn't matter

574
01:22:07,137 --> 01:22:11,437
We are both definitely here

575
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:20,815
Guess that's true...

576
01:22:52,782 --> 01:22:53,942
What happened?

577
01:22:59,923 --> 01:23:01,151
I've got to go back!

578
01:23:02,025 --> 01:23:04,118
What? No! We've come this far!

579
01:23:04,895 --> 01:23:06,829
But this is the end of the line

580
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:10,322
That's not true. It'll start moving

581
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:12,628
I'll go check with the driver.
Come with me

582
01:23:14,437 --> 01:23:17,429
OK, but promise you'll
wait right here

583
01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:19,472
I'll be right back. Promise

584
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,070
Harue!

585
01:25:18,194 --> 01:25:20,526
The Forbidden Room

586
01:26:17,387 --> 01:26:19,287
Construction Materials - red tape

587
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:13,535
I'm...

588
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:18,168
Not alone...

589
01:28:37,727 --> 01:28:39,160
Harue,

590
01:28:39,295 --> 01:28:41,627
it's me, Kawashima

591
01:28:44,767 --> 01:28:47,736
Harue! Listen!

592
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:52,736
Listen, what do you say to this?

593
01:28:53,209 --> 01:28:55,803
The two of us live together

594
01:28:56,012 --> 01:28:59,072
That way, we can always be together

595
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:03,010
If we keep living alone,

596
01:29:03,186 --> 01:29:06,644
we'll just get worse and worse
because we're weak

597
01:29:07,023 --> 01:29:09,457
We'll balance each other out

598
01:29:09,759 --> 01:29:12,159
How about living that way?

599
01:29:12,528 --> 01:29:14,621
Would you try it with me?

600
01:29:14,764 --> 01:29:17,858
What do you think, Harue?!

601
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:28,206
Harue!

602
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:30,810
Harue!

603
01:29:32,282 --> 01:29:33,442
Harue!

604
01:29:42,925 --> 01:29:46,019
Tokyo: Missing

605
01:29:46,162 --> 01:29:49,325

01:30:13,222 --> 01:30:16,555
Tokyo: Missing
Fukuda Tatsuya, age 57

613
01:31:05,475 --> 01:31:07,807
Um... are you OK?

614
01:31:14,317 --> 01:31:15,750
Breakdown?

615
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:19,213
Yeah

616
01:31:19,555 --> 01:31:20,920
Want some?

617
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,198
You are?

618
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,401
Oh, me? Um...

619
01:31:38,007 --> 01:31:39,668
What are you doing here?

620
01:31:42,812 --> 01:31:44,677
What am I doing here...?

621
01:31:47,583 --> 01:31:48,641
You?

622
01:31:56,259 --> 01:31:57,624
So neither your dad nor your mom

623
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,127
made it through...

624
01:32:01,764 --> 01:32:02,924
No...

625
01:32:04,133 --> 01:32:07,159
So many things happened at once,

626
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:09,802
it's impossible to sort them all out

627
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,229
Yeah

628
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:19,206
Me too. My head's all messed up

629
01:32:21,384 --> 01:32:23,614
So you're a student, Kawashima?

630
01:32:23,753 --> 01:32:24,651
Yeah

631
01:32:26,022 --> 01:32:27,011
Lucky you

632
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:28,787
I don't think so

633
01:32:29,325 --> 01:32:30,349
Here

634
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,152
Oh, thanks...

635
01:32:35,598 --> 01:32:36,622
And you?

636
01:32:37,433 --> 01:32:38,764
I had a job

637
01:32:39,836 --> 01:32:41,064
Wow, amazing

638
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:42,599
Nothing amazing

639
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:48,042
Did you have any friends?

640
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:50,037
Friends?

641
01:32:53,082 --> 01:32:54,481
Maybe one, I guess

642
01:32:55,418 --> 01:32:56,510
What was she like?

643
01:33:00,423 --> 01:33:02,084
What? I don't really know...

644
01:33:04,427 --> 01:33:06,691
I never really found out...

645
01:33:07,296 --> 01:33:08,456
Where is she?

646
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:11,030
Somewhere...

647
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:15,997
OK, try starting it

648
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:29,681
OK, good

649
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:48,158
Why don't you look for her?

650
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:50,094
What?

651
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,274
She's still somewhere, right?
You've got to help her then

652
01:33:57,446 --> 01:33:58,777
But...

653
01:33:59,882 --> 01:34:02,942
Let's go find her. I'll help you

654
01:34:09,692 --> 01:34:11,990
This is the last stop...

655
01:34:17,266 --> 01:34:21,032
After that we go as far as we can

656
01:34:25,408 --> 01:34:28,775
I can sort of see...

657
01:34:29,979 --> 01:34:31,139
The future...

658
01:34:41,591 --> 01:34:45,118
"Help"

659
01:35:08,618 --> 01:35:10,347
Look over there

660
01:35:13,522 --> 01:35:15,353
An abandoned factory?

661
01:35:22,498 --> 01:35:24,261
I wonder...

662
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:28,497
Shall we try it?

663
01:35:47,223 --> 01:35:50,715
Listen, even if you see
a door sealed with red tape,

664
01:35:50,926 --> 01:35:53,292
don't go near it, OK?

665
01:35:54,096 --> 01:35:55,495
I know

666
01:36:19,922 --> 01:36:21,048
You OK?

667
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,257
Look... at this

668
01:37:13,275 --> 01:37:14,674
Look... over there

669
01:37:41,203 --> 01:37:42,500
Kawashima

670
01:37:42,638 --> 01:37:43,764
Harue!

671
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,366
Watch out!

672
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:49,268
What happened, Harue!

673
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:52,611
What are you doing with that?

674
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:00,220
Let's get out of this place together

675
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:04,556
Together?

676
01:38:05,561 --> 01:38:06,789
Yeah

677
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:21,303
C'mon, hand it over

678
01:38:21,477 --> 01:38:23,069
Harue! Harue!

679
01:38:25,915 --> 01:38:29,851
Oh, no, a hospital...

680
01:38:42,431 --> 01:38:45,059
Harue! Don't die!

681
01:38:45,234 --> 01:38:47,065
C'mon! Please!

682
01:38:48,737 --> 01:38:50,034
Help me!

683
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:55,466
Harue!

684
01:39:07,923 --> 01:39:09,447
We couldn't save her...

685
01:39:12,261 --> 01:39:13,193
No...

686
01:39:37,486 --> 01:39:39,044
We're out of gas...

687
01:39:40,956 --> 01:39:43,618
I'll get some,
there was gas back there

688
01:39:43,993 --> 01:39:45,153
You'll be OK?

689
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:47,519
Wait for me. I'll be OK

690
01:41:45,547 --> 01:41:47,310
Forever...

691
01:41:49,351 --> 01:41:50,875
death was...

692
01:41:51,086 --> 01:41:53,577
eternal Ioneliness...

693
01:42:02,731 --> 01:42:09,637
Help...

694
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:13,771
Don't ask me!
What's that got to do with me!

695
01:42:15,277 --> 01:42:17,108
Forever...

696
01:42:17,746 --> 01:42:19,577
death was...

697
01:42:20,382 --> 01:42:21,872
eternal Ioneliness...

698
01:42:29,858 --> 01:42:31,883
You're not real

699
01:42:33,295 --> 01:42:36,287
I refuse to acknowledge... Never...

700
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:39,532
I refuse to acknowledge death!

701
01:43:24,313 --> 01:43:25,837
I know

702
01:43:27,349 --> 01:43:29,283
I'll catch you

703
01:43:29,918 --> 01:43:32,045
Then you'll disappear

704
01:43:33,388 --> 01:43:35,879
That's it, right? Right?

705
01:43:36,859 --> 01:43:39,020
You can't beat me!

706
01:44:08,524 --> 01:44:10,492
I am...

707
01:44:12,928 --> 01:44:15,488
real...

708
01:46:09,978 --> 01:46:11,536
Kawashima!

709
01:46:18,787 --> 01:46:20,118
What is it?

710
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:22,883
Forget it... Let's go...

711
01:48:38,059 --> 01:48:40,391
It's too much...

712
01:48:52,174 --> 01:48:56,167
What... are you doing?

713
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:04,913
You went in there...

714
01:49:06,988 --> 01:49:08,182
Me?

715
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:12,286
Yeah, I did, but I'm fine

716
01:49:27,776 --> 01:49:29,437
Don't cry

717
01:49:53,034 --> 01:49:54,296
You want to go back?

718
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:57,600
To what's left of Harue?

719
01:50:03,912 --> 01:50:05,402
That makes you feel better?

720
01:50:11,286 --> 01:50:14,744
If that's what you want,
I'll go with you

721
01:50:18,593 --> 01:50:19,855
No...

722
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:22,660
Let's go...

723
01:50:23,532 --> 01:50:25,466
As far as we can go

724
01:50:30,305 --> 01:50:31,966
Are you sure about that?

725
01:50:38,547 --> 01:50:39,844
Yeah

726
01:50:58,333 --> 01:50:59,891
Can you get out?

727
01:51:07,309 --> 01:51:08,469
You OK?

728
01:51:21,256 --> 01:51:22,484
Be careful

729
01:51:33,435 --> 01:51:34,493
Wait here, OK?

730
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:53,210
Death comes to us all...

731
01:52:54,015 --> 01:52:57,951
If so, maybe we would
have been happier,

732
01:52:58,086 --> 01:52:59,986
had we gone with the rest

733
01:53:01,056 --> 01:53:04,719
But we chose to keep going

734
01:53:05,026 --> 01:53:07,722
into the future...

735
01:53:26,948 --> 01:53:29,348
We'll head for Latin America

736
01:53:29,751 --> 01:53:32,413
We're still getting signals there

737
01:53:33,288 --> 01:53:34,721
Though they're pretty weak

738
01:53:36,624 --> 01:53:38,421
We've got to give it a try,

739
01:53:40,061 --> 01:53:41,426
no matter what we find

740
01:53:45,066 --> 01:53:46,658
If anyone's survived,

741
01:53:46,868 --> 01:53:48,460
we can head out again

742
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:50,001
and go...

743
01:53:53,007 --> 01:53:54,736
as far as we can

744
01:54:03,785 --> 01:54:07,050
C'mon, be strong

745
01:54:11,092 --> 01:54:14,528
Have I done the right thing?

746
01:54:16,598 --> 01:54:17,587
Yes

747
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:19,894
Are you sure?

748
01:54:20,668 --> 01:54:21,760
Yes

749
01:54:22,203 --> 01:54:25,138
You're doing the right thing

750
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:06,437
Now, alone with
my last friend in the world,

751
01:55:07,348 --> 01:55:09,509
I have found happiness
