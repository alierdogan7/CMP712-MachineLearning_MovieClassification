Okay, zip it up.
We'll finish at the morgue.

Jesus, Allison.

1256
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,075
What possesses you
to talk to cadavers?

1257
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,740
What if
there's no afterlife?

1258
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,875
Wouldn't you want someone
to talk to <i>you</i>

1259
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:12,784
like a normal human being
one last time?

[Helicopter whirs]

1265
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,549
I've arranged
a ride home for you,

1266
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,949
so I guess
you're free to go.

1267
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,716
Thank you, detective...
for everything.

1268
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,489
Uh, one more thing.

Yeah. It was...
my anniversary gift.

01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,979
Oh.

1273
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:18,008
You know, I was gonna
turn it in as evidence...

1274
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,678
but I'll tell you what...

1275
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,018
Why don't you
take it home?

[Siren wailing]

1277
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,558
