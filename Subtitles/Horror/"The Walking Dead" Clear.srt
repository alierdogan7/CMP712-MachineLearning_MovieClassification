If you're gonna get a crib,
you have to get the box.

184
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,218
It's big and heavy.

185
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:08,387
You're gonna need help
carrying the box.

186
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:11,390
You are getting
a crib, right?

187
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,258
That's what I said.

188
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,561
Then I'll go with him.

189
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,767
Right there,
that's the deal.

190
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,572
You get into trouble,
you holler, okay?

191
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:30,341

You don't have
to come with me.

194
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:56,766
I can handle it.

195
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:58,768
I told your dad
I'd help you.

196
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,204
Yeah, okay.

Mmm.

Shit.

I want to do this
on my own.

the baby place.

You turn.

00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:58,839
You just die.

I'm not wearing
a dead man's face.

241
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,273
I gave you this.

242
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:25,376
I said I'd turn it on
every day at dawn

243
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:27,678
so you could find me.

244
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:33,850
Rick?

245
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:37,987

Oh, man.
Damn it, I--

I know you.
I know who you are.

248
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:48,130
You said you'd turn
yours on at dawn.

249
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:49,832
That's what you said.

250
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,168
I mean, I hadn't
worked up to it yet, and--

251
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:56,037
then I did.

252
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,538
On the roof, every
morning for days,

253
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:04,045

me and my boy.

254
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,647
And then...

255
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,950
me.

256
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,088
Just static, though.
Nothing but static.

257
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:16,190
And then nothing
but nothing.

258

You weren't there.
You were never there.

259
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,762
- I was.
- No, not when I tried.

260
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:24,098
I mean, you said you would
turn on your radio

261
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,632
- every day at dawn.
- Morgan, I--

262
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,945
You said that you would
turn on your radio...

263
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:29,146
- I did!
- ...every day at dawn

264
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,004

265
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,379
I kept getting--
I kept getting pushed farther out.

266
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,852
I had to.
I didn't have a choice.

267
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:49,821
I found my wife
and my boy.

268
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:51,724
I had people.

269
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,727
I had to keep them safe.

270
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:59,397
We kept getting pushed back
deeper into the country.

271
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:03,601
I swear to God
I didn't have a choice.

272
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:05,570
You can have
your radio back

273
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:08,873
'cause it looks like
I finally found you.

274
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:12,385
You found your wife
and your son.

275
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,286
That's what happened, right?
You found them.

276
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,987
And did they--

277
00:26:22,988 --> 00:26:25,422
Did she--
did your wife--

278
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:27,357
did she turn?

279
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:31,928
No, she died.

280
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:36,866
So you didn't have
to see that, then.

281
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,935
Of course not.

282
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:41,705

Not like me.

283
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:44,308

No.

284
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,010
Not like me.
Not like my wife.

285
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:49,912
You remember
what happened to her?

286
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:54,417
You remember
what she was?

287
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:57,553
Yeah.

288
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,693
Oh.

289
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:08,930
You gave me the gun.

290
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:11,433
You tried.

291
00:27:11,434 --> 00:27:13,535
What did I try, Morgan?

292
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,903
( laughs )
What did I try?

293
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:18,939
You tried to get me to do it
'cause I was supposed to do it.

294
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,675
I was supposed
to kill her, my Jenny.

295
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:24,978
Knew I was supposed to,
but I let it go.

296
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:29,082
Let it go like there wasn't
gonna be a reckoning.

297
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,854
We was always
looking for food.

298
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:37,256
You know, it always
came down to food.

299
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:39,459
And I was--

300
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,761
I was checking out
a cellar

301
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,397
and I didn't want Duane
to come down there with me.

302
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:46,766
And then when I came up...

303
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:52,170
she was standing there
right in front of him

304
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,273
and he had his gun up

305
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,909
and he couldn't do it.

306
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,646
So I called to him

307
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,615
and he turned.

308
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:05,616
And then she was just--

309
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,318
just on him.

310
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,422
And I see red.
I see red.

311
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,958
Everything is red.
Everything I see is red.

312
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,727
And I do it.

313
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,164
Finally.

314
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,667
Finally was too late.

315
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,473
I was supposed to.

316
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,243
I was selfish.

317
00:28:34,244 --> 00:28:35,978
I was weak.

318
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:44,119
You gave me the gun.

319
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:50,592
Hey, your boy--

320
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:52,294
is he dead?

321
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:57,465
- No.
- No?

322
00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:59,333
He will be.

323
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,268
See, 'cause people
like you,

324
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,104

they always die.

325
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:06,974
And the bad people do, too.

326
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:10,043
But the weak people,

327
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,312

I just think it's none
of your business.

And that's why you're here.
That's it.

That's how we get it done.

364
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:02,629
Hey.

365
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:16,276
I just--

366
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:18,878
I just thought
Judith should--

367
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,913
should know what
her mom looked like.

368
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:24,283
Thank you.

369
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:27,386
I was gonna go
back in anyway.

370
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,590
I just couldn't
leave this behind.

371
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,825
It's just
too damn gorgeous.

372
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:40,631
I'm not going
to kill you.

373
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:46,537
I don't think that's
what's supposed to happen.

374
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:49,440
I think you're supposed
to come back with us.

375
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:51,775
( laughs )

376
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,111
After all that?

377
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,846
After me trying to blow
your head off,

378
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:58,515
stab your heart out,
happily ever after together?

379
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:00,149
You couldn't kill me,
I couldn't kill you.

380
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,618
I'll take that
as a sign.

381
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:05,355
Huh.

382
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:09,359
We found a prison.

383
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,795
The fences
can keep 'em out.

384
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,532
Is that where your wife died?

385
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:22,538
Just go.

386
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,239
Don't go back.
Don't stop.

387
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,842
<i>Just get yourself</i>
<i>some more time.</i>

388
00:35:26,843 --> 00:35:29,644
Look, I can help you.

389
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,779
You can come back with us.
You can heal.

390
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,548
You're taking a lot
of guns, Rick.

391
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:37,752
No, I'm just saying that
that all is a lot of guns.

392
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:40,588
Why do you need
the guns, Rick?

393
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,557
'Cause if you got
something good,

394
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,924
that just means that there's
someone who wants to take it.

395
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:47,427
And that is what
is happening, right?

396
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:49,229
We're gonna win.
( chuckles )

397
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,931
You can be there.
You can help.

398
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:55,335
You will be torn apart
by teeth or bullets.

399
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:57,637
You and your boy.

400
00:35:57,638 --> 00:36:00,273
Your people,
but not me.

401
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:03,108
Because I am not gonna
watch that happen again.

402
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,749
Man, you take the guns.

403
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,351
You know there's a chance.
That's what you can't square.

404
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:13,853
That's what hurts.

405
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:16,154
You know there's a chance!

406
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:18,423
I don't think you heard
a damn word that I said!

407
00:36:24,864 --> 00:36:28,366
We both started out
in the same place.

408
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:31,936
Things went bad for you,
things went bad for me.

409
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:35,773
But you're not
seeing things right.

410
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:37,875
I don't blame you,
what you've lost,

411
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,476
what you've been through.

412
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,011
You're not
seeing things right,

413
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,447
but you can come back from this,
I know you can.

414
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,418
You have to.

415
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,552
This can't be it.

416
00:36:49,553 --> 00:36:52,488
It can't be.

417
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,724
You got to be able
to come back from this.

418
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:59,529
- No.
- Morgan, please.

419
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,196
No!

420
00:37:02,466 --> 00:37:04,233
I have to clear.

421
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:06,334
That's why
I didn't die today.

422
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:07,803
That's the sign.

423
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:10,338
I have to, man.
I have to.

424
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:15,844
I have to clear.

425
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:41,136
( growling )

426
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,479
Hey.

427
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,548
I was just about
to look for you.

428
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:56,918
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

429
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,819
You're here now.

430
00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:04,925
Oh, it's nothing.

431
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:10,931
Thank you.

432
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,746
He's okay?

433
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:31,149
No, he's not.

434
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,990
Wait.
Hey.

435
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:41,359
- Carl.
- Morgan.

436
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,530
I had to shoot you.

437
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:48,531
You know I had to, right?

438
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:54,704
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:57,141
Hey, son.

440
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:00,710
Don't ever be sorry.

441
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,505
Everything okay with her?

442
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:34,109
I think she might
be one of us.

443
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,877
What?

444
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:42,082
Everything went okay.

445
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,518
( chuckles )

446
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,521
Hop in.
I'll throw this in the back.

447
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:13,545
You see something?

448
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,617
I know you see things.

449
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,220
People.

450
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,125
I used to talk
to my dead boyfriend.

451
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,595
It happens.

452
00:40:34,967 --> 00:40:36,500
You want to drive?

453
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,635
Yeah.

454
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,803
Good.

455
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:43,073
I see things.
