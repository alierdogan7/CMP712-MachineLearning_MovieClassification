00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,623


2
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Help him!

3
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Hold it!

4
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,400
Look what's hanging here -

5
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,600
a lighter.

6
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Poor Oliveira...

7
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Only 20 years old.

8
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Once it hits the bloodstream, 
there's nothing you can do.

9
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Better a bullet than a dart
tipped with curare.

10
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,600
But we gave him the serum
right away.

11
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Sure, the serum.

12
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
It only works half the time,

13
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
if it isn't already too old 
by the time we get it.

14
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,70
They'd just love to blow his
head off because of Oliveira.

15
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,000
So would I.

16
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
But we're expecting that Yankee,

17
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,200
and we have orders 
to assist him.

18
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
He's in luck -

19
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,400
a Yacùmo prisoner is like a
passport into the Green Inferno.

20
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
It's full of shit, clean it!
