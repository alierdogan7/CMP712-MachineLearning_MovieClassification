That's a good girl.

366
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:21,174
We only have to do this
five more times.

367
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,801
(SCREAMS)

368
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,131
I want that truck.

369
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,048
Oi! Oi!

370
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,592
Can we come inside?

371
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,878
There's fuckin' zombies
everywhere!

372
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,551
Yeah, OK.

373
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,210
How do we get in?

374
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,714
Alright!

375
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:17,175
Let 'em get close to ya,
then run around 'em.

376
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,002
OK.

377
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,261
Just make sure
that door comes up.

378
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,419
Run, ya bastards!

379
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,503
- Nice shootin', Ned.
- Thanks, mate.

380
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,968
(THUD!)

381
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,299
Yeah, there's a lot of good shit
in here we can use, eh?

382
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,426
What's that, mate?

383
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:13,636
That HiLux out the front-
which one of youse owns it?

384
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,590
That HiLux ain't goin' nowhere.

385
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,252
Yeah? Why's that?

386
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:18,760
You drove from the city, right?

387
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:20,464
- Right.
- Where's your car?

388
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,968
Broke down.

389
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,378
Engine trouble?

390
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,465
Yeah. Right.

391
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,969
I need to show you boys
something.

392
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:42,298
Petrol, metho, kero. Alright?

393
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,130
Last time I checked,

394
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,044
they were flammable liquids,
weren't they?

395
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,462
- How old's that stuff?
- Brand-spanking-new, mate.

396
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,674
- We bought it last week.
- So your car just stopped, eh?

397
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:09,677
Guess that'd explain it.

398
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,299
What the fuck?!
Who's that?

399
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,960
That's Neville.

400
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,672
Oh!

401
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:25,133
Oh, that's fuckin' rank!

402
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:28,375
- He's fartin' out of his mouth!
- It's weird, eh?

403
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,840
Oh, fuck it.

404
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,464
(WHISPERS) 'Night, Neville.

405
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,257
- Ooh, shit!
- What the fuckin' fuck?

406
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,090
The bloods flammable!

407
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,586
Oi! Wake up, Neville.

408
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:28,715
Come on.

409
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,127
- We need petrol, right?
- Right.

410
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,465
Wrong. We need fuel.

411
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,215
There's no way that could work.

412
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,548
There's one way to find out.

413
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,502
Let's get him out of there.

414
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,628
Righto, Kel,
give it a crack now.

415
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:58,170
Fuck!

416
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,210
Come on!

417
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,174
(MOTOR STARTS)

418
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,504
- You beauty!
- Good on ya, Neville!

419
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,841
If we can get that truck inside,
we can definitely hook him up,

420
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,297
drive the fuck outta here.

421
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,085
That's gonna be
a mission, but, eh?

422
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,127
Yeah, but it's doable.

423
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,460
We need to armour up.

424
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,719
Big-time.

425
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,635
Fuck yeah!

426
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,877
They're going for it!

427
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,591
- Ready?
- Born ready!

428
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,798
Right. Let's do this!

429
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:30,127
Come on, you fuckin' zombies!

430
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,423
- I'm out!
- Same!

431
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,300
(SCREAMS)

432
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:39,007
It bit it off! That thing
bit me fuckin' nose off!

433
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,670
Frankie, how does it look, mate?
Is me nose gone?

434
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,427
Is it bit off?
Tell me, Frankie!

435
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,132
Yeah, there's not much
nose left, mate.

436
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,466
(YELLS)

437
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,882
- Kel!
- What is it?

438
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,669
Your fuckin' eyes, mate!

439
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,461
What about me fuckin' eyes, Frankie?
What's up with 'em?

440
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:03,969
- Move out of the way, Frank.
- Wait!

441
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,547
Wait! What are you
fuckin' doin'?

442
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,006
- He's gonna turn any second.
- He's a mate!

(SNARLS)

444
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,503

(ENGINE RUNS)

446
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,219
This is bullshit.

447
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,420
What the fuck is that?

448
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:49,463
This, my friend,
is a gas-powered harpoon.

449
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:53,004
I built it for a mate
so he can hunt sharks in Perth.

450
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:56,011
- Is that thing legal?
- Don't be stupid!

451
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:58,465
Does it work?

452
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:05,006
I'd move out of the way
if I were you.

453
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,844
Fuck me! Bullseye!

454
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:33,171
Once that door goes up,
that's it, we're on our way.

455
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,461
Has everyone got
everything they need?

456
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,548
- Yep.
- Ready as we're gonna be.

457
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,051
Righto.

458
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,006
Wait a minute. Frank?

459
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:44,592
- Yeah, mate?
- Did you turn the stove off?

460
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,961
Right. Let 'er rip, Benny.

461
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,548

What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

465
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,678
Fucking kicked me in the balls!

466
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:36,967
Get him up on the wall
and get out of my lab, you moron!

467
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,834
You call me a moron again,
I'll fuckin' drop ya.

468
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,254
By which you'll be demonstrating
your superior intellect.

469
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,548
Good comeback.

00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,927
Hmm.

Hmm.

475
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,676
Oi.

476
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:14,544
Should we stop for petrol?

477
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,593
I need to piss.

478
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,381
I need to piss.

479
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,926
You're gonna have to wait, mate.

480
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:08,510
Barry, that means
"Pull the truck over so I can urinate."

481
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:11,216
Can't you hold on?
We're nearly there.

482
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,173
Just be quick.

483
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,210
Mate, take the rifle.

484
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,844
Frank, I'm just
taking a piss, mate.

485
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,378
- Take the fuckin' rifle.

at the same time, Frank.

489
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:30,086
But if you wanna come out
and hold one of 'em,

490
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,547
I'll be flattered, mate.

491
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,210

00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,003
- Never get out of the truck.
- Let's get out of here.

503
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,636
You, uh, gonna put
your cock away first?

- He's empty, you reckon?

Nah, he's not empty.
Have a look at 'em.

was Neville breathing the gas?

No. That only really
started up this morning.

Yeah.

515
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,253
They stop
breathing the gas at night.

516

That's why they're faster.
They're using it themselves.

This the worst fuckin' nightmare
of your life or what?

What the fuck
could be worser than this?

528

About 15 years ago,

529
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,961
a doctor told me
me son had brain cancer.

530

about that, Frank.
