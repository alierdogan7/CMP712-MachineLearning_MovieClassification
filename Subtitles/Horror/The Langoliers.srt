It's not a human scalp.
Is that what you felt?

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,300
What do you see?

173
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,200
Nothing, just mountains
and darkness.

174
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,000
Hello?

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
Hello. Hello?

176
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,900
What's wrong? The flight crew
disappear with everybody else?

177
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Yeah. No. I don't know.
They're not answering my calls

178
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,600
- and the door's locked from the inside.
- I was afraid of that.

179
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
Sorry to get your wind up.
Nick Hopewell.

180
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
I am praying, sir, that the pilot's cap

181
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,700
I noticed on one of the first-class seats
belongs to you.

182
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,100
It does. Captain Engle.

183
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,500
But under the circumstances,
you can call me Brian.

184
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,600
I'll call you saviour if we find
what I expect to find

185
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
on the other side of that door.

186
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,800
Well, let's try and get it open,
shall we?

187
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay.

188
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
All right, let's see.

189
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,900
How could someone disappear
and leave their hairpiece behind?

190
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,500
That's quite a mystery,
don't you think?

191
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
- God.
ALBERT: Yeah,

192
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
you're not kidding.

193
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,000
Somebody's bridge work.

194
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,800
I was afraid of that.

195
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
What's going on here?

196
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
TOOMY:
Hello, excuse me.

197
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,600
Come out from back there.
Who's back there?

198
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,000
- Hi.
BRIAN: Yeah.

199
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,900
I'd like to know
what's going on, please.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,100
Currently, we're about to break
the cockpit door.

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,900
It seems our crew have abdicated
along with everybody else.

202
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,100
But we're in luck all the same.

203
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,500
My new acquaintance here
just happens to be a pilot.

204
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
Do you work
for American Pride, friend?

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,100
Yes, I do.

206
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,700
- But I think what's important...
- No, I'm gonna tell you...

207
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,700
BRIAN: Excuse me.
- I'm gonna tell you what's important.

208
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
You know what's important?

209
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,300
I have a meeting at Boston's
Prudential Center at 9:00 this morning.

210
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Promptly at 9:00.

211
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,700
That's what's important.

212
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Now, I booked a seat
on this conveyance in good faith,

213
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,900
and I have absolutely no intention
of being late for that appointment.

214
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Wait, wait, wait.

215
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Now, I have three
questions for you:

216
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,600
Number one, who authorised

217
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
an unscheduled stop for this airliner
while I was asleep?

218
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
[MAN EXHALES]

219
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,200
Number two,
where was that stop made?

220
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,900
And number three, why?
Why was that done?

221
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,000
You ever watch Mr. Spock
on <i>Star Trek?</i>

222
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,900
What the hell are you talking about?

223
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
Just that if you don't shut
your cake hole, you bloody idiot,

224
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,300
I'll be happy to demonstrate
his Vulcan sleeper hold for you.

225
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,600
Don't you talk to me like that.
Do you know who I am?

226
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
Of course I do.

227
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,100
You're an obnoxious twerp who likes
to hide fear behind aggression.

228
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,300
No harm in that,
but you are in the way.

229
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,800
Listen to me. Listen... Aah!

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
- Aah!
- Whoa, a nose hold.

231
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,300
I can break it.
Easiest thing in the world, trust me.

232
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,500
TOOMY: Aah!
- I said I could break it.

233
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,600
Do you understand?
Signify if you understand.

234
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Ow!

235
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,900
NICK:
You listen to me,

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
I haven't got time to discuss
your business appointments,

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
therefore I'm gonna send you
to the cabin

238
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,800
with this gentleman
in the striped shirt.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Don Gaffney.

240
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Mr. Gaffney will be your escort.

241
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,800
Once you arrive in the main cabin,
you will sit down in your seat,

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,500
strap your seat belt firmly around
your middle and keep your mouth shut.

243
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you understand?

244
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,700
Please favour me with a thumbs up
if you understand.

245
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Jolly good.

246
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Now, I'm gonna let go of you
and your nose now.

247
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,300
And when I do, if you so much
as utter a word,

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,800
a syllable, you will be investigating
hitherto unexplored realms of pain.

249
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
- You son of a...
- I wouldn't, mister.

250
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
This guy means it.

251
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,400
You better come on back with me.

252
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,900
- I'll be...
- Oh! Bad idea.

253
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,300
GAFFNEY:
Come on, now.

254
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,800
Hey. Come on.

255
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
Come on.

256
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,500
Let's see if we can find something
for that nose.

257
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Right, then,

258
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,800
let's get the cockpit door open,
shall we?

259
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
NICK:
Come on...

260
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,300
Whoa.

261
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,100
No one's driving the plane.

262
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
It happened fast, whatever it was.

263
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Look there.

264
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I mean, look here.

265
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
If you want watches, take your pick.

266
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
There are tons of them back
in the main cabin.

267
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Are there indeed?

268
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,800
ALBERT:
Watches, jewellery and glasses.

269
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,400
Also purses.

270
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,700
But the weirdest thing is,

271
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,600
there's stuff that we're pretty sure
came from inside of people.

272
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
Like surgical pins, pacemakers.

273
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,500
You know, I've been going on the
same assumption as our rude friend...

274
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,400
You know, the one I used
the nose lock on?

275
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
- That the plane had landed
somewhere for some reason

276
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,000
and most of the passengers and crew
were somehow offloaded and then...

277
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,800
No, there couldn't have been
a takeoff while we were sleeping.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,700
You can fly that plane on automatic

279
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,800
but you need a human being
to take one up or land.

280
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
So where are the passengers
and crew then?

281
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I don't know.

282
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
But I plan on finding out.

283
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,100
You wanna hand me that paper,
please?

284
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Well, the altitude is right,
37,000 feet.

285
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,600
We're on course.

286
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
What are you doing?

287
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,300
Figuring out
our closest major airport.

288
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,200
Denver Center, this is American Pride
Flight 29, do you read me? Over.

00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,600
[STATIC CRACKLING]

290
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,700
Denver Center, come in, please.

291
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,800
This is American Pride Flight 29,
we have a problem.

292
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,200
- A big problem.
- What's going on?

293
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,900
I'm not getting anything.

294
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Anything at all.

295
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Mayday, mayday.
This is American Pride Flight 29,

requesting emergency aid.
Come in, please.

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
UNICOM,
this is American Pride Flight 29,

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,600
requesting immediate radio contact.
Over.

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,800
Denver, come in.

Come in, please.

This is AP Flight 29,
you answer me, damn it.

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,000
Easy, mate.

303
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
That dog won't bark either.

304
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,400
What are they doing down there,
having nuclear war?

305
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,200
Look, easy. Tell me what you mean,
"the dog won't bark."

306
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,900
I mean Denver Control. That dog.

307
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,700
I mean FAA Emergency, that dog.

308
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,000
UNICOM, which gives advisories
at small airports, that dog too.

309
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,000
This is a medium shortwave band.

310
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,700
People should be jumping all over this
like frogs on a hot sidewalk,

311
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,400
but I'm not even picking up static.

312
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,300
And the VOR beacon out of Denver,
that's not working either.

313
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,600
- What does that mean?
BRIAN: It means we have no radio.

314
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,900
It means we have no Denver
navigational beacon,

315
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,300
and my board here says everything
is peachy keen.

316
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,500
Which is crap. It's gotta be.

317

Hey, kid, would you run back there,
look out the left side of the plane.

318
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,300
Look behind us,
tell me what you see.

319
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,100

50 miles south of Denver right now.

There's nothing out there,

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,900
nothing at all.

323
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,500
Denver's blacked out, isn't it?

324
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,900
Yeah.

325
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,900
Either that or it's gone.

326
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,700
All right, back to your seats.
We need a little peace and quiet.

327
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,200
We are being quiet.

328

Come on, my young friends.
Let's go sit in the back.

329
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,800

trying to raise an airport on the radio.

introduce ourselves.

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,500
My name's Dinah Bellman

345
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,300
and I'm on my way to have
an eye operation in Boston.

346
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,300
Afterwards, I'll be able to see again.

347
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,600
Probably be able to see again.

348
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,800
The doctors say there's a 70 percent
chance I'll get some vision

349

I'll get all of it.

You've got 10 people on this airplane
and your job's the same as it ever was:

373
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,100
To get them down in one piece.

You don't have to tell me

Can you avoid other aircraft?

391

I can navigate just fine
with the onboard equipment.

We have no cockpit-to-ground

from the airplane.

And the purpose
of such an experiment,

506
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,300
given the circumstances,
would be to document the effect

511
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,400
After this is released into the air,
everyone falls asleep,

512
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,100
with the obvious exception
of the pilot,

513
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,200
who is breathing uncontaminated air
through a mask.

514
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,800
Then the captain lands the plane
at a secret airstrip,

515
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,000
in Nevada, let's say,

516
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,200
whereupon, with the exception of the
nine randomly chosen test subjects,

517
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,100
all the sleeping passengers
are carefully carried off the plane

518
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,400
and placed aboard
another identical plane.

519
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,500
The captain then gets Flight 29
airborne again

520
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,000
and returns it
to its original altitude and heading.

521
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,100
He activates the autopilot,
he disables the radio systems.

522
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,900
And then as the effect of the gas
begins to wear off,

523
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,500
the captain hears on his intercom

524
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,300
the voice of the little blind girl
calling for her aunt,

525
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,100
and he knows
that this will wake the others.

526
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,000
The experiment is about to begin.

527
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,900
Captain Engle is one of them?

528
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,400
Well, in this scenario he is.

529
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,700
If Captain Engle is one of the people
who did this,

530
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,100
we're gonna have to capture him
as soon as we land.

and perhaps that British fellow.

it doesn't hold up.

- But you just said...
- What I said was,

536
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,800
if it were just this plane,
I could give you a scenario.

537
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,100
But unfortunately,

00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,400
it's not just this plane.

still down there,

01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,000
Jolly good.

1179
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,200
Mr. Jenkins, pray continue.

1180
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,500
I'm sorry, but I write
about these things.

1181
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,500
I just haven't taken part in them.
Until now, that is.

1182
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:40,500
I think you're doing great, Mr. Jenkins,
and I like listening to you too.

1183
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,600
It makes me feel better.

1184
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,600
Oh, well, thank you.

1185
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:50,300
Thank you. That's very nice
of you to say that, Dinah.

1186
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,200
I think I found a fallacy
in our thinking,

1187
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,400
and it is this:

1188
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:05,900
We all assumed as we began to grasp
the dimensions of this event

1189
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,800
that something had happened
to the rest of the world.

1190
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,100
But the evidence doesn't bear
that assumption out.

1191
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,400
What has happened

1192
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,300
has happened to us,

1193
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
and us alone.

1194
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,800
I am convinced that the world
as we know it

1195
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,400
is ticking along as it always has.

1196
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:30,100
But it's we,

1197
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:35,700
the 10 survivors of Flight 29,
who are lost.

1198
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,400
Please tell us what you know,
Mr. Jenkins.

1199
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,900
I can't help but feeling
that we're running out of time and fast.
