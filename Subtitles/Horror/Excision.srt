1
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,152
(gurgling)

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,326
(gasps)

3
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,421
(moaning)

4
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,569
(gasps)

5
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,043
(toilet flushes)

6
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,179
What do we do when we
use the bathroom, Bob?

7
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,725
We lift the lid.

8
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,060
I did.

9
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,104
You're disgusting.

10
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,995
Chew with your mouth closed.

11
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,292
Really, Pauline, I raised
you better than that.

12
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,554
Yes, you may be excused.

13
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,561
Thank goodness I have you.

14
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,272
Hm.

15
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,191
(bell rings)

16
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,488
Much has changed
since I was an adolescent.

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,117
The function of reproductive
organs, however, has not.

18
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,786
Now before we get side-tracked
looking at pictures of penises,

19
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,913
I want to have
a frank discussion

20
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,708
on the issue
of sexual transmitted diseases.

21
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,170
Fact: One in two
sexually active teenagers

22
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,213
will contract an STD
by the age of 25.

23
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,132
What do you think about that?
Yeah, Pauline?

24
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,011
Can you contract an STD from
having sex with a dead person?

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,143
(chuckles)

26
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,688
Any real questions
in this audience?

27
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,064
Yeah?

28
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,108
Boy: If a mosquito bites you
that has AIDS...

29
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,819
No, I mean,
it would be one thing

30
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,197
if he was like muscular
and a ginger.

31
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,449
But he's scrawny and a ging
and it just doesn't work.

32
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,201
Oh, my God, you're so mean.
I think he's cute.

33
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,166
Okay, so last night Adam
could not get hard

34
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,003
- and it was like totally awkward.
- It's never stopped me.

35
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,714
Okay, tell me the truth.
Is it this?

36
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,592
Like--

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,177
Please don't do that.

38
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,138
- Is it? Just tell me the truth.
- No.

39
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,350
- Kind of.
- (laughs)

40
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,269
- Maybe he's gay.
- No.

41
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,521
Hey.
What did I miss?

42
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,689
Hey, nothing.

43
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,025
Your girlfriend's friend
thinks you're gay.

44
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,861
Excuse me?

45
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,864
You're not pretty enough.

46
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,326
(seatbelt alert beeping)

47
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,746
Buckle up.

48
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,708
I'm your mother,
it's my job and it's the law.

49
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,421
Buckle your seatbelt!

50
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,548
We're not going any further
until you do.

51
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,219
Thank you.

52
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,681
If you want to be treated as an adult,
you need to start acting like one.

53
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,559
I don't understand why you insist
on playing these childish games?

54
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,399
Tell me about your day.

55
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,734
I'd rather not.

56
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,779
Tell me two things about your day
or I'm gonna hit the truth horn.

57
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,656
Fuck the truth horn.

58
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,284
(horn honking)

59
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,578
All right, enough!

60
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,917
I learned about the Civil War

61
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,462
and sexually
transmitted diseases.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,339
Lovely.

63
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,674
I guess we better get going.

64
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,343
We don't want to be late
for your appointment.

65
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,928
You could you at least
have the decency

66
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,139
to take me to an actual
psychiatrist.

67
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,099
Your father and I are
not made out of money.

68
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,435
Reverend William
is a very bright man.

69
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,688
You're Iucky to have him.
He's doing you a real favor.

70
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,107
(church bell rings)

71
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,568
What's the matter, Pauline?

72
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,157
What's the church's stance
on organ donations?

73
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,658
Well, it's a touchy subject.

74
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,453
Here we believe the body
is a temple.

75
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,415
And what if I told you I found
the resting place

76
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,792
of Jesus Christ
in my backyard

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,129
and that with just a few advances
in science and technology

78
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,715
I could resurrect him myself?

79
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,718
I'd say that you are a very
troubled Iittle girl.

80
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,805
I only want you to endure
the same gut-wrenching agony

81
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,932
during these sessions
that I go through

82
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,144
every single Sunday listening
to your sermons.

83
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,321
Thank you!

84
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,245
(church bells ringing)

85
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,791
I know I don't believe in you.

86
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,336
So you're totally justified
if you choose to ignore me.

87
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,423
I just-- I've been meaning
to get something off my chest.

88
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,802
I haven't read your book
in its entirety.

89
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,347
Just can't bring myself to invest that
much time into a work of Iiterature

90
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,432
that's received so many
mixed reviews.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,226
I'm an avid reader.

92
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,771
There's just so much
stuff out there.

93
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,815
Okay, here goes.

94
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,567
I'm planning on having
premarital sex.

95
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,487
I know you're not gonna
be 100 % onboard with it.

96
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,782
Which is why I was wondering
if we could discuss

97
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,617
your rules surrounding
forgiveness.

98
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,869
I'm under the impression
if I ask you to forgive me,

99
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,205
you kind of have to.

100
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,792
Which is pretty awesome,
I just got to say.

101
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,878
If I'm off-base, let me know.

102
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,674
Otherwise, I'm gonna move
forward as planned.

103
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,467
Amen.

104
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,595
(bell rings)

105
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,598
(indistinct chatter)

106
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,996
Something the matter, Pauline?

107
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,498
I'm done.

108
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,834
Are you quite sure?

109
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,253
Quite.

110
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,006
Some of these equations here,

111
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,592
they don't seem to be completed.

112
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,555
That's probably because my ability
to solve these equations

113
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,725
has absolutely no bearing
on my future as a surgeon.

114
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,312
Ah, a surgeon, of course.

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,107
You know, mathematics and surgery,
they go hand in hand.

116
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,277
I mean, if a patient's life
is at stake,

117
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,322
there's no room for error.

118
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,745
Get it done.

119
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,624
It's such a lovely lapel pin.

120
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,127
You must tell me
where you came across it.

121
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,385
Sweetheart,
don't be confusing.

122
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,471
You know I can't
understand a thing

123
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,182
when you start waving
your hands around like that.

124
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,808
Mom?

125
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,645
Pauline?
What a wonderful surprise.

126
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,396
What the fuck
are you doing here?

127
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,733
Don't make me wash
your mouth out with soap.

128
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,322
Why do you have this?

129
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,950
We were just talking
about Cotillion.

130
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,327
You're trying to ruin my life.

131
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,621
(bell rings)

132
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,679
Teenagers.

133
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,486
Mother, I'd like to talk to you about
why you were at school today.

134
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,448
What about it?

135
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,618
You do realize I'm too old
for Cotillion class?

136
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,871
Mrs. Guthrie has decided
to open her doors

137
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,999
to a wider age range this year.

138
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,959
She's a dear friend
in dire need of assistance.

139
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,712
So I've decided to take
on a position as chaperone.

140
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,256
You can't be serious.

141
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,425
No daughter of mine
is going off to college

142
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,053
without knowing the ins and outs
of what it's like to be a proper lady.

143
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,055
I can't wait for Cotillion.

144
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,767
And what do you have to say
about all this?

145
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,899
I think what your mother
is trying to do is--

146
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,485
Your mother?
Excuse me.

147
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,404
This was our decision.

148
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,740
I knew Dad had nothing
to do with it.

149
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,451
You don't even have enough backbone
to stand up for your own wife?

150
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,827
You're repulsive.

151
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,288
Make sure Grace takes her pills.

152
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,917
Un-fucking believable.
Sorry.

153
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,105
That's complete bullshit.
It's not gonna happen.

154
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,481
Happened to my sister.

155
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,150
(clears throat)

156
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,985
I don't think we've been
formally introduced.

157
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,196
I'm Pauline.

158
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,075
I'm Adam.

159
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,871
(boys laugh)

160
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,834
Forgive me for being too
forward, but...

161
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,213
I want to Iose
my virginity to you.

162
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,674
(laughs)

163
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,928
I'm clean and I spent my
allowances on birth control, so...

164
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,264
That's nice.

165
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,352
Adam.

166
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,356
It's my number.

167
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,820
Call me.

168
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,781
- You're on the top of my list.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,409
I won't wait forever.

170
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,299
I'm ready to lose my virginity.

171
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,051
It's a common misconception

172
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,263
that having intercourse during
menstruation is unhealthy.

173
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,227
When I lose my virginity,

174
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,731
I want to be on my period.

175
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,068
Girls, we're having
early dinner.

176
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,072
I'm not hungry.

177
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,909
Come, Pauline.
Look at you.

178
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,207
(laughter on TV)

179
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,462
I thought you were on a diet.

180
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,423
I'm not gonna keep cooking you
special meals

181
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,550
if you're gonna gorge
yourself on ice cream.

182
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,803
Honey, it's the weekend!

183
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,768
(machine humming)

184
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,064
(turns machine off)

185
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,899
(coughs)

186
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,533
You're my heart,
you know that, don't you?

187
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,618
I saw Charlotte wearing
a dress just like this one.

188
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,370
Who is Charlotte?

189
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,664
She's the most popular
girl I know.

190
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,792
She only dates older boys.

191
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,797
Stay away from Charlotte.
She sounds trashy.

192
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,216
No, she's not.

193
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,468
She only dresses like she is.

194
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,820
(breathing heavily)

195
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,221
Sweetheart, you've got a bit
of something on your nose.

196
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,391
I know, it's a piercing.
I did it last night.

197
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,144
You ruined your face?

198
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,646
Did you sterilize the needle?

199
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,314
What if it gets infected?

200
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,483
I used antiseptic.

201
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,069
You know, I pierced a few things
when I was younger, too.

202
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,738
(chuckles)

203
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,076
You look like trash.

204
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,619
Get over it.

205
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,247
You are not going out of this house
with that thing in your nose.

206
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,418
Look what you've done
to your mother.

207
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,420
Now you take that thing
out right now.

208
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,101
Bob, be honest.
Am I being too hard on Pauline?

209
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,020
You both have your moments.

210
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,022
I'm not becoming
my mother, am I?

211
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,942
Honey, if you were
becoming your mother

212
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,612
I wouldn't be filing bills right now,
I'd be filing for a divorce.

213
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,120
Not now.

214
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,383
It's just like Mom to make me
take out my nose piercing.

215
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,552
You saw it this morning, right?

216
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,721
The procedure was a success.

217
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,557
I'm telling you, Grace,
these hands are gifted.

218
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,809
Martin broke up with me.

219
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,811
Who's Martin?

220
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,521
My Internet boyfriend.

221
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,692
You'll move on.

222
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,986
Men are pigs.

223
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,625
That looks like fun!

224
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,338
I haven't jumped rope
since lower school.

225
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,216
I'm flat-footed,
it's bad for my knees.

226
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,635
Okay?

227
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,099
I could just get insoles.

228
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,226
Maybe we could jump rope
some time.

229
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,771
I don't think so.

230
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,444
Hey! Don't be mean
to my sister!

231
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,740
Come on, Pauline.

232
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,329
- (rain pattering)
- (thunder crashes)

233
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,084
(cell phone vibrates, rings)

234
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,178
- Who is this?
- Uh, it's Adam, from school.

235
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,971
It's late, Adam, what is it?

236
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,389
I want to take you up
on your offer.

237
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,517
I have a car and a fake ID.

238
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,268
You know, we could get like
a hotel room or something.

239
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,020
Pick me up Monday at noon.

240
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,563
Teacher work day?

241
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,234
That's right, Adam,
teacher work day.

242
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,277
I'll tell my mother
we're in a study group.

243
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,904
Okay, good.

244
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,906
So, uh--

245
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,574
(beeps)

246
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,428
(sniffs)

247
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,935
Dear God, one thing
I've been thinking about.

248
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,938
The whole thing about relatives
watching over you after they die

249
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,274
really rubs me the wrong way.

250
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,526
I do a lot of crazy shit
while I'm alone

251
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,862
and I'd appreciate
some privacy.

252
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,158
I don't want to sound
presumptuous.

253
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,201
But if I do get into heaven

254
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,579
and my relatives have been
watching over me,

255
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:29,167
a lot of relationships will
have been compromised.

256
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,711
- Man on TV: Hallelujah!
- Group: Hallelujah!

257
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,172
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

258
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,382
(man continues preaching)

259
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,325
(man moaning)

260
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,009
(gasps)

261
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,146
They have canoeing.

262
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,068
What's all this?

263
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,528
We're sending your sister
to CF camp.

264
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,739
- What did she do?
- Cute.

265
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,200
Last summer, Gracie had the
time of her Iife at CF camp,

266
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,451
didn't you, honey?

267
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,119
Everyone has the disorder,
so I fit right in.

268
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,290
Mom, a boy named Adam is gonna
pick me up around noon.

269
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,875
He's put together a study group,

270
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,379
because we have a really
big test next week.

271
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,714
I'll only be gone a few hours.

272
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,220
This boy in your study group
must be something.

273
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,888
How'd you meet?

274
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,391
Just get this over with.

275
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,562
(radio playing)

276
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,927
(engine starts)

277
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,454
So, um--

278
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,539
It's okay.

279
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,875
This will be our little secret.

280
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,838
I, uh...

281
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,341
stole some condoms
from my brother's room.

282
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,427
They're the big kind.

283
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,849
Take off your pants.

284
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,912
(gasps)

285
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,836
It appears you're too small
for the big kind.

286
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,177
But that's not a bad thing.

287
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,389
It's just--

288
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,850
it'll hurt less, so it's good.

289
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,479
Um...

290
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,899
we'll forget the condoms.

291
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,026
Like I said,
I'm on birth control

292
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,696
and that is over
99 % effective, so...

293
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,369
Okay, yeah.

294
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,380
Take off your clothes, Adam.

295
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,387
(exhales)

296
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,389
(moaning)

297
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,075
God, you're so fucking wet.

298
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,914
(gasps)

299
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,147
(shrieks)

300
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,509
I want you to go down on me.

301
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,469
Okay.

302
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,852
(moaning)

303
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,612
(Adam gasps)

304
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,955
What the fuck?

305
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,211
(radio playing)

306
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,927
Thank you, Adam.

307
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,724
I had a really nice time.

308
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,693
Can you get the fuck
off my car?

309
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,211
How did it go?

310
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,469
It was everything
I'd hoped it would be.

311
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,683
Good. I'm so glad.

312
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,396
First things first.
I don't want to be pregnant.

313
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,064
I know I was on my period

314
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,483
and that pretty much takes
care of that,

315
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,944
but I'm still a little paranoid.

316
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,656
In any case, if I am pregnant,
I'm just gonna have an abortion.

317
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,075
Apparently, you don't approve
of abortion,

318
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,620
so save us both the trouble.

319
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,092
(crying)

320
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,135
It's okay.

321
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,642
Phyllis:
She's with the angels.

322
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,270
I know.

323
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,032
You know what the worst thing
is about having cystic fibrosis?

324
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,493
What's that, sweetheart?

325
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,245
When your friends die.

326
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,421
Last night we found out
Grace's best friend

327
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,756
from CF camp passed away.

328
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,137
Please make a special effort to be nice
to her while she mourns the Ioss.

329
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,139
Where is she?

330
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,266
She had a doctor's appointment.

331
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,105
She's gonna need a lung
transplant, isn't she?

332
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,524
You've been
doing your homework.

333
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,943
It's a very serious procedure.

334
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,697
There's a high risk
of infection.

335
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,534
With all the mishaps that happen
in hospitals these days,

336
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,912
perhaps you should consider
an alternative.

337
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:15,002
That day is a Iong ways
down the road, Pauline.

338
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,092
All right, next question.
Let's see.

339
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,220
Somebody asked,

340
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:29,224
"Is it true that being fat results
in poor sperm quality?

341
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:32,352
And if so, do you have to use
protection while having sex?"

342
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,690
Yes, fact: being overweight does
affect your sperm quality.

343
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,901
What the hell are you doing?

344
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,528
You're gonna set off
the fucking fire alarm.

345
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,240
I lost my virginity yesterday.

346
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,576
Checking myself for STDs.

347
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,746
You are such a freak.
Who would sleep with you?

348
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,916
"Mr. Claybaugh,
does it mean that you're gay

349
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,626
since you try to suck your
own dick all the time?"

350
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,753
Who asked this question?

351
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,088
Anybody know who wrote this?

352
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,757
If somebody could tell me
who wrote this question...

353
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,967
You're an idiot. Do you really think
that you're gonna be able to tell

354
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,428
if you have an STD
by looking at your blood?

355
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,097
Pauline:
It's just one of those things.

356
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,436
Brachiosaurus thing.
Weird. I don't know.

357
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,149
- Sorry.
- Hello, Adam.

358
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,027
Hey, what are you doing here?

359
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,157
I'd watch out for Pauline,
if I were you.

360
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,160
She gave herself an STD test
in science class today.

361
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,789
Everything was fine, but you
can never be too careful.

362
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,707
Oh, Natalie, I meant to ask you,

363
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,918
do you have any STDs?

364
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,753
Absolutely not.

365
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,132
Good, then neither do I.

366
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,014
- What is she talking about?
- I have no idea.

367
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,183
How was school today?

368
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,310
Dreadful.

369
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,938
Things not going well
with your friend?

370
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,273
What friend?

371
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,942
The boy from the study group.

372
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,278
Adam?

373
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,531
He was tolerable,
but I've lost interest.

374
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,159
Well, that's a shame.

375
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,329
He seemed
like such a nice young man.

376
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,666
Pauline: First off, this will
be our last session.

377
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,670
You are completely unqualified
to be doing this. It's unethical.

378
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,548
I have it on the highest
authority that you're wrong.

379
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,093
I refuse to allow you to indulge
in my psycho-sexual fantasies.

380
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,178
I would imagine a man
as repressed as yourself

381
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,723
would have his own
issues to work out.

382
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,058
I'm here to listen, not judge.

383
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,061
Psychiatry is a science.

384
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,939
At least in some circles anyway.

385
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,525
If there's one thing I know,

386
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,195
it's that science
and religion don't mix.

387
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,702
So, that's it then?

388
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,163
That's it.

389
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,210
(religious music playing)

390
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,009
(turns off radio)

391
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,846
Dear God, in regards to my sister,

392
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,682
while I might not show
it all the time,

393
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,268
I love her.

394
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,064
Please allow me to do everything
in my power to cure her.

395
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,735
And lastly, my mother.

396
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,071
Kill her.

397
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,657
Kill her before
she can make me attend

398
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,452
those horrible
Cotillion classes.

399
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,412
You'll probably want
to make it painless.

400
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,164
I get it, that's your thing.

401
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,249
But hear me out.

402
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,045
A little pain never hurt anyone.

403
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,756
Besides, you can always
just blame it on the devil.

404
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,174
(doorbell rings)

405
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,176
And what have we here?

406
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,346
My jump rope club's raising money
to benefit inner-city youth.

407
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,975
How wonderful.
Step inside.

408
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,237
- What are you doing here?
- None of your business.

409
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,030
You weren't very nice
to me the other day.

410
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,949
You're weird.

411
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,456
Come here again and I will
perform a tracheotomy on you

412
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,042
with the blunt end of one
of yourjump ropes.

413
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,260
God loves you.

414
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,721
Thank you.

415
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,479
(girls giggling)

416
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,364
What's so funny?

417
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,326
Do you purposely leave your house
looking like a raging lesbian?

418
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,829
You do have the body
of a 10-year-old boy.

419
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,290
That's a highly
unfortunate opinion.

420
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,333
Especially considering
your vagina

421
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,377
looks like
a diseased ax wound.

422
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,837
That's vile.

423
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,215
I actually get afraid that
I might get a yeast infection

424
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,760
just being in the same room
with that thing.

425
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,137
Look, I spoke with Adam.

426
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,056
And I got to hand it to you,
from the sounds of it,

427
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,266
he's freakier than I imagined.

428
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,394
So I dumped him.
He's all yours.

429
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,438
Forgive my vulgarity,

430
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,484
but Adam licks pussy
like a dog drinks water.

431
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,069
I'm not interested.

432
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,113
Suit yourself.

433
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,866
You mind if I leave you
with some advice?

434
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,035
Make it quick,
I got to take a shit.

435
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,205
You're disgusting.

436
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,794
Stop spending your
allowance on birth control

437
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,297
and invest in some estrogen
pills, okay?

438
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,931
(girls giggling)

439
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:12,025
♪ My bones fall in ♪

440
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:16,071
♪ My bones fall out ♪

441
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,367

442
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:24,412
♪ Beside my heart... ♪

443
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,916
What are you doing?

444
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,002
I'm thinking of performing
an umbilical plasty on myself.

445
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,671
What's that?

446
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,923
Long story short,

447
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,593
I want to reshape my navel
and allowance won't cover it.

448
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,012
What do you think?

449
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,266
Boys don't care
about belly buttons.

450
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,268
They care about these.

451
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,149
My world does not revolve around
boys like yours does, Grace.

452
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,110
I'm doing this for myself.

453
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,464
Come on.

454
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,426
Breathe, Pauline.
Good girl.

455
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,387
Bob, you have a cold sore
on your lip!

456
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,055
You should have waited
for the lifeguard.

457
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,640
Are you serious?
She could have died.

458
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,975
Well, when she's a teenager,

459
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,311
you get to explain to her why
she has herpes on her lip.

460
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,979
Unbelievable.

461
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,190
Pauline, what did I tell you?

462
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,525
The high dive is for big girls.

463
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,824
I can cut it myself.

464
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,163
Phyllis:
I have some exciting news.

465
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:52,334
Today, I bought Pauline
the most elegant dress.

466
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,420
Perfect for both church
and Cotillion.

467
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,049
You won't let it rest,
will you?

468
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,343
I refuse to go to church.

469
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,429
Isn't it enough that I'm willing
to subject myself to the humiliation

470
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,514
of Cotillion with a bunch
of adolescents?

471
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,643
Phyllis: Well, Cotillion will help
you land a decent husband.

472
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,354
I'm gonna get married one day.

473
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,064
To a black guy.

474
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,690
Well, don't expect
for him to be faithful.

475
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,526
African-Americans
are notorious adulterers.

476
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,614
Don't look at me
like that, Bob.

477
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,158
Well, they are.

478
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,203
(sighs)

479
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,669
Tomorrow night is gonna be over
before you know it.

480
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,046
Pauline,

481
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,590
you're gonna look beautiful.

482
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,595
I know I can be a bit of
a demented bitch sometimes.

483
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,643
But you still love me, right?

484
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,312
Of course, I do.

485
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,648
Oh, God, you're getting
a cold sore.

486
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,733
Jesus, Mom, show some tact.

487
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,528
It's okay.

488
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,739
We just won't do the pictures.

489
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,173
What's the occasion?

490
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,551
Well, I was so excited about
tonight, I couldn't sleep.

491
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,804
So I decided I might as well
get started in the kitchen.

492
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,431
Bacon. Nice.

493
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:33,560
Maybe if I eat enough I can
induce a coronary.

494
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,523
Hey, Dad? Thanks.

495
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,028
You're welcome.
I saved your life.

496
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,282
On the off-chance that I have
another near-death experience

497
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,409
and you're the only one around,

498
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,454
what new sexually transmitted
disease can I expect to acquire?

499
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,709
I will be down in 10 minutes.
Please be ready to go.

500
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,462
Come upstairs when you're
through with your breakfast.

501
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,549
Dad?

502
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,885
I don't want to hear it.

503
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,360
Young lady?

504
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,323
- Principal Campbell.
- Mm-hmm.

505
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,116
Save some for the rest of us.

506
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,745
AII right?
(chuckles)

507
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,678
Ew, don't sit next to me.

508
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,597
Where's your friend Natalie?

509
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,682
None of your business.

510
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,770
Yes, Pauline?

511
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,563
I have to go to the bathroom.

512
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,982
Do you have any
hall passes left?

513
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,609
No.

514
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,861
Oh, well, I'm sorry,

515
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,240
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to wait until the bell rings.

516
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,619
Anyone here like to take a shot

517
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,872
at explaining
Cramer's Rule to the class?

518
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,374
Anyone?

519
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,585
Abigail.

520
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,880
It's a formula for solving systems

521
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,675
of equations by determinants.

522
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,635
Cooper:
Yes, correct.

523
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,347
Yes, Pauline?

524
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,434
I have to go to the bathroom.

525
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,812
All right, make it quick.

526
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,898
And don't make me regret this.

527
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,881
(door opens)

528
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,841
Oh!

529
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,801
Congratulations!

530
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,928
You've now Iost
your bathroom privileges

531
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,930
to the end of the semester.

532
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,932
Was I really gone that long?

533
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,435
Just take out
your text book, page 73.

534
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,604
See if you can catch up
with the rest of the class.

535
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,608
And if you have any questions,
you know where I am.

536
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,864
- (groans)
- What is it now, Pauline?

537
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,241
I feel sick,
may I go to the clinic?

538
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,952
Tough it out.

539
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,456
In another 10 minutes, you'll be
somebody else's problem.

540
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,005
You are so full of shit.

541
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,977
Mr. Cooper?

542
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,271
I think I'm gonna be sick.

543
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,660
(coughing)

544
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,245
Oh!
(gags)

545
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,831
Oh, that's disgusting.

546
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,336
Well, your temperature's normal.

547
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,714
Maybe you have food poisoning.

548
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,967
Maybe.

549
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,177
There's a multitude
of bacterial infections

550
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,096
I'm not willing to rule out.

551
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,895
Let's not forget to sanitize that.
It is my favorite thermometer.

552
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,982
I'm very disappointed in you.

553
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,400
For what?

554
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,569
When your school called,

555
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,989
my first inclination was to
check the medicine chest.

556
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,700
A touch unsympathetic, I know.

557
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,620
But I have a pretty good grasp
of how your mind works.

558
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,747
That's when I discovered
that the ipecac syrup

559
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,208
had mysteriously disappeared.

560
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:12,088
That's impressive
detective work, Mother.

561
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,716
Pretending that you're sick?

562
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,844
It's an all-time low, Pauline.

563
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,139
Your sister would do anything
for a healthy body

564
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,724
and you take it so for granted.

565
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,726
Relax.

566
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,895
It's not Iike I have
Munchausen Syndrome.

567
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,690
It was a last ditch effort
to get out of Cotillion.

568
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,693
That's all.

569
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,321
Well, it didn't work.

570
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,961
You look beautiful.

571
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,423
We're gonna have to beat
the boys off with a stick.

572
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,799
Gross.

573
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,636
Agh, back off!

574
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,971
Good Iord, Pauline!
You just had something on your face.

575
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,100
The average human mouth contains
nearly 600 species of bacteria.

576
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,770
My cheek might as well
be a Petri dish.

577
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,772
When did you become
so germaphobic?

578
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,441
I thought you wanted me to make
a good impression, right?

579
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,819
In the unlikely event that someone
shows up with a microscope

580
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,697
you can blame me, okay?

581
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,660
Stand up straight.

582
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,789
Better.

583
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,957
(waltz playing)

584
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,259
Mother, this is bizarre.

585
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,806
I didn't take the age difference
into consideration

586
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,975
as much as I should have.
For that I apologize.

587
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,148
Try and make the best of things.

588
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,839
You okay?

589
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,676
I'd rather be at home
with a good book.

590
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:29,392
Well, that makes two of us.

591
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,437
What do you think boys see

592
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,523
in all these overly made-up
cum dumpsters?

593
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,943
I wouldn't know.

594
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,739
Boys don't talk to me unless
they need help with their homework.

595
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,251
Have you ever thought
about having work done?

596
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,547
(scoffs)

597
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,722
Want to dance?

598
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,897
So, how old are you?

599
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,315
18.

600
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,901
That's pretty old.

601
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,861
Not really.

602
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,947
Grace Marie!

603
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,784
What on earth
has gotten into you?

604
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,368
I'm vulnerable right now.

605
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,414
Young Iady, you just Iost your
computer privileges permanently.

606
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,755
Amber, I'm really sorry,
but this is not working out.

607
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,716
I think I'm gonna have to pull
the girls from Cotillion.

608
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,136
What's--
what's that on your lip?

609
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,888
It's a cold sore.

610
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,973
It's pretty disgusting.

611
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,893
Oh, well, thanks.

612
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,812
Sorry.

613
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,484
(spits, groans)

614
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,738
(spitting)

615
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,325
What happened?

616
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,619
The girl with herpes
on her face kissed me.

617
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,830
Does that mean I'm gonna have
herpes on my face, too?

618
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,331
Not necessarily.

619
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,292
I asked her to dance.
I thought she was a retard.

620
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,669
I was just trying to be nice.

621
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,170
Pauline, how could you?

622
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,340
It's pretty
self-explanatory, Mother.

623
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,510

The library.

642
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,080
I get a concerned call from
Principal Campbell

643
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,998
that you didn't show up
for school today.

644
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:25,127
And you expect me to believe
that you were at the library?

645
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,786
(screams)

646
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,755
You saw her at dinner.
She's disturbed.

647
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,508
- I want her out of this house.
- Bob: She's a teenager.

648
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,343
Phyllis: Bob, don't you
dare take her side!

you won't see it coming!

- Bob, she's a fucking menace!

651
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,684
No wonder all of her friends
have fallen by the wayside.

I have tried and tried!

654
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,107

667
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,531
Pauline?

668
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,620
We're home.
Everything all right in there?

669
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,498
- (knocks on door)

(breathing heavily)

672
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,073
Pauline, your toilet
is clogged again.

673
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,408
What on earth are you
flushing down there?

674
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,660
I must not be getting
enough fiber.

675
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,245
That's enough.

676
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,580
This is inappropriate dinner
conversation.

677
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,750
Honestly, Bob, sometimes I feel
as if I have a third child.

678
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,379
And just where do you think
you're going?

679
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,047
You haven't asked to be excused.

680
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,218
May I please be excused?

681
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,262
Not until you finish
your dinner.

682
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,766
I'm full, and I don't need
any more calories.

683
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,270
We can't all use menopause
as an excuse for weight gain.

684
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,568
I think you look great.

685
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,700
Dear God, I've had a lot
on my plate recently.

686
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,536
Last week I had sex
for the first time.

687
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,289
My little sister
is slowly dying.

688
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:57,126
And my mom, as I'm sure you
know, is a total bitch.

689
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,087
I'd accept full responsibility
for all my actions,

690
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,632
but let's face it,
you gave me hormones.

691
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,856
I need to talk.

692
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,442
What did I do?

693
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,152
Nothing.

694
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,696
You didn't do anything.

695
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,698
I just want to talk.

696
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,702
I've been reading this
new book in my book club.

697
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,206
It's caused me to do
a lot of self-reflection.

698
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,876
Although, honestly, sometimes I feel
Iike I'm the only one reading it.

699
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,795
I swear to you, Pauline,
some of these Iadies,

700
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,214
they just use it as an
excuse to get together.

701
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,592
Anyway, it's got me
thinking that...

702
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,930
perhaps I could be
a bit more patient.

703
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,599
Sounds like you joined
the right book club

704
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,309
a few years too late.

705
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,228
Take it easy, Pauline.

706
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,399
Some of your behavior has been
downright sociopathic.

707
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,775
Solely based on the definition,

708
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,903
I don't know a teenager who
doesn't profile as a sociopath.

709
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,989
When I was your age,

710
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:55,077
my mother hurt me
more than words can say.

711
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,581
I'm still trying
to forgive her for that.

712
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,549
I don't want us to have
that relationship.

713
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,678
Are you finished?

714
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,946
Abigail: Natalie, oh, my God,
you're a dumb ass.

715
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,698
Cunt is spelled with a C.

716
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,283
Natalie: Fuck off.
If it's spelled with a K

717
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,784
you still know what it means.
It sounds the same.

718
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,494
Abigail: Oh, my God, cross it out.
You're an idiot.

719
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,914
- No, it's fine.
- Cunt is with a C.

720
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,833
Yeah, well, Pauline's
a fucking moron, so it's fine.

721
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,835
- You're a fucking moron.
- Fuck off.

722
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,943
(rock music playing)

723
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,745
(chuckles)
I don't understand it.

724
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,706
I don't. What-- what is it
with you, Pauline?

725
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,500
Have you no remorse?

726
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,878
I'm the victim here,
Principal Campbell.

727
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,839
It's not my fault I was born
with a chemical imbalance.

728
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,633
Will you stop making excuses
for yourself?

729
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,386
- I'm not making excuses.
- Yes, you are.

730
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,388
We've been all through your file
and there's no mention here

731
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,057
of any kind
of psychological problem.

732
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,434
Give me five minutes with
a clinical psychiatrist

733
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,062
and you'll have a doctor's note
that will clear this right up for you.

734
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,897
Isn't that how it's done?

735
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,233
No, no.

736
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,197
You will be held accountable

737
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,325
for your own actions.

738
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,369
You understand? You.

739
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:46,248
You, look super busy.
I'm gonna go.

740
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,884
Suspended indefinitely.

741
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:01,430
You're months away from graduating
and you pull this kind of stunt?

742
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,890
There's only one explanation
the way I see it.

743
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,769
I have borderline
personality disorder.

744
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,440
It's gone undiagnosed for years
and this was a cry for help.

745
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,192
Go to your room.

746
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,782
Bob!

747
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,808
(knocks on door)

748
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,602
I need the plunger.

749
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,437
You and your father
are relentless.

750
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,982
Entering as you knock completely
defeats the purpose of knocking.

751
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,859
Oh, my God.

752
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,153
What did you do to your arm?

753
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,490
Relax, I'm not a cutter.

754
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,825
It's sort of like a tattoo.

755
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,702
It's hideous.

756
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,872
What on earth would compel
a young girl

757
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,833
to carve a crucifix
into her arm?

758
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,337
It's the symbol
for the Red Cross.

759
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,839
Bob!

760
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,350
Why is everyone so sad?

761
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,020
We're not sad, honey.
We're disappointed.

762
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,690
Your sister did
a very bad thing today.

763
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,859
Do you have any idea

764
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,530
how hard I've worked
to get you into that school?

765
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,573
Now you're on the verge
of being expelled.

766
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,492
It makes me sick
to my stomach.

767
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,538
I'm not one
to advocate violence,

768
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,540
but every now and then,
people like Natalie

769
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,375
need to be punched
in the face.

770
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:59,047
I've tried to be supportive,
but I'm finished.

771
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,051
You're delusional
about a career in medicine.

772
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,054
I think at this rate,
you'd have a hard time

773
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,723
holding down a job
at a fast food restaurant.

774
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,891
Give it a rest.

775
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:13,061
I can always take the GED test.

776
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,230
Open up some sort
of private practice.

777
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,066
Like your father said,
you're delusional.

778
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,764
Never thought I'd say this,

779
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,476
but I'm starting to miss not having
the whole family at breakfast.

780
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:56,021
I can wake you up for family
breakfast if you Iike.

781
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,232
On second thought,
this is very nice.

782
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,026
Your father and I had
a long talk last night.

783
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,194
Jesus Christ.

784
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,988
Do not use the Lord's
name in vain.

785
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,449
Not now, not ever.

786
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,909
Go on.

787
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,161
I'm not gonna pretend to understand
what you're going through.

788
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,038
It's over my head.

789
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,998
So your father and I have
decided to break the bank

790
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,083
and send you to see
a real psychiatrist.

791
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,961
The earliest appointment
we could get is for next week.

792
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,839
Hopefully,
you'll have an easier time

793
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,926
opening up to Dr. Sadler
than you have to us.

794
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:29,304
If money is tight, feel free
to dip into my college fund.

795
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,139
(sighs)

796
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,685
We are praying for a miracle.

797
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:39,272
It'd be a miracle if Dr. Sadler
could undo the damage

798
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,441
caused by Reverend William.

799
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:46,112
We might not have always made
the best decisions for you,

800
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,157
but we have always had
your best interest in mind.

801
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,578
(phone ringing)

802
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,501
Phyllis:
Hello.

803
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:05,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

804
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,681
Dr. Gray called with bad news.

805
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,018
He's recommending that we put
Grace on the transplant Iist.

806
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,896
I don't understand,
she looks so healthy.

807
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,337
Where's Mom?

808
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,006
Mrs. Taylor is sick.

809
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,300
She's taking a casserole
over to her house.

810
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,886
What are you doing?

811
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:54,264
Looking at pictures.

812
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,933
I hope I Iive Iong enough
to get married some day.

813
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,606
I'm going to do everything in my
power to make sure that happens.

814
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,280
What was that for?

815
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,782
I've been doing a Iot of
research on your condition.

816
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,285
And I read that your
skin tastes Iike salt.

817
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,749
Yuck.

818
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,084
(laughs)

819
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:29,132
Well, if I ever do
get married some day,

820
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,593
I want you to be
my maid of honor.

821
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,827
This may seem a little bit
out of character for me,

822
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,163
but I want to thank you both
for putting up with me

823
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,915
the way that you have.

824
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,917
I tried to call you
several times today.

825
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:06,628
What have I told you about not
picking up your phone?

826
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,297
Can we not do this right now?
I'm trying to have a heart to heart.

827
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,467
Yeah, let her speak.
I'm enjoying this.

828
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,969
Go ahead, sweetie.

829
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,764
I just want you both to know

830
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,809
that I plan on making you proud.

831
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:25,230
Being expelled from school forced
me to put things into perspective.

832
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,774
I'm turning my life around.

833
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,485
I realize...

834
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,904
it's not all about me anymore.

835
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:37,325
Well, I'm glad
to hear that, honey.

836
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,328
Sometimes it takes
hitting rock bottom

837
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,957
for us really to want
to make a change.

838
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,253
What your father
is trying to say,

839
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:51,006
is that we'll believe it
when we see it.

840
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,841
In other news,

841
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,343
your father and I are gonna go into
the city tomorrow night for dinner.

842
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,179
Jennifer's gonna come over
and look after you girls.

843
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,349
Jennifer is two years older than me
and she's coming over to babysit?

844
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,352
Jennifer is a very
responsible young woman.

845
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,855
(coughing)

846
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,986
Call Dr. Gray!

847
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,203
I want to thank you
for providing me with the mental

848
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,331
and physical strength
to accomplish great things.

849
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,960
Thank you for believing
in me when no one else does.

850
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,047
Against my betterjudgment,

851
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,051
I guess what I'm trying
to say is

852
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,845
it's getting harder and harder
for me not to believe in you.

853
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,227
I'd ask you to put in a good
word with my parents,

854
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,771
but I've pretty much got
that taken care of.

855
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,731
(coughs)

856
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,901
I'm gonna be out
of reach for a while.

857
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,070
I hope you don't get lonely.

858
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,573
Amen.

859
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,926
(laughing)

860
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,268
You nearly slept the day away.

861
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,062
I need my eight hours.

862
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,439
Jennifer cancelled, your father
is gonna stay and look after you girls.

863
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,109
He should be home any minute.

864
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,946
(car engine starts)

865
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,976
I made us some tea.

866
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,561
Since when do you drink tea?

867
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,647
Since I started reading
about anti-oxidants.

868
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,983
You're not getting any younger.

869
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:18,278
You should take better care
of yourself.

870
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,947
If Mother cared about you
half as much as I do,

871
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,158
she'd make you
drink tea every day.

872
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,035
Look, Pauline.

873
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,997
You need to lay off your mother.

874
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,999
Everything she does,
she does out of love.

875
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,168
One day you'll understand.

876
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,432
I'm really sorry we got
off on the wrong foot.

877
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,521
I was hoping to make amends.

878
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,151
I've got some old jump ropes.

879
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,448
My sister can't use them
'cause of her lungs.

880
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,884
(muffled screams)

881
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,580
Grace?

882
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,799
You're not going to understand

883
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,468
what I'm about to do.

884
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,847
But someday

885
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,642
you'll thank me.

886
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,738
(muffled screams)

887
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,534
Hello.

888
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,860
Bob?

889
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,490
Bob, what happened?

890
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,910
Where's Grace? Bob!

891
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,412
Grace?

892
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,474
(muffled shouting)

893
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,685
Phyllis:
Gracie?

894
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,168
Gracie?

895
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,925
Gracie!

896
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,973
Come closer.

897
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,810
I want to show you the detailed
work I did on Grace's sutures.

898
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,859
It's a mess, I know.

899
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,778
It's just my first surgery.

900
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:54,655
I haven't perfected
my technique.

901
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,324
What have you done?

902
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,911
What have I done?
You mean, with the other one?

903
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,333
I didn't know what to do
with her body

904
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,793
after I successfully
retrieved the lung.

905
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:11,255
So I practiced my incisions.

906
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,176
You have to take
a closer look, Mom.

907
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,972
She is extraordinary.

908
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,978
