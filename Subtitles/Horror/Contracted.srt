Yeah.

556
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,132
So how was work last night?

557
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,098
Oh, it was fucking awful.

558
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,399
There was this guy there that
was hitting on me all night.

559
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,332
Actually, he reminded
me of that fellow

560
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,332
that always comes in to see you.

561
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,431
Riley.

562
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:22,731
Yeah, that's him.

563
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:23,965
I just don't understand it.

564
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,498
It's like they know
they can't have us,

565
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,564
so they try even harder.

566
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:32,232
Finally I just told him, I said,
"I'm not gonna touch your cock."

567
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,931
Then he ran up a $200 tab
trying to impress me.

568
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,200
It was pathetic.

569
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,668
Are you not feeling well?

570
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:46,899
I'm okay.

571
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:54,931
I don't mean to be a twat,
but you look like shit.

572
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:56,931

573
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:59,498

574
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:02,731
I think that hangover
is sticking with me.

575
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:05,298

577
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,631
Anyway, I've got your post.

578
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:12,464
Oh, anything from the committee?

579
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:14,065
I've been waiting to hear back.

580
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:15,534
I don't know.

581
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,332
So I got us something.

582
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,434
Did you?

583
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,298
Today's ten months.

584
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:35,798
Oh. Right.

585
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:39,098
I didn't know we were
exchanging gifts.

586
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,101
It's kind of an odd
anniversary, right?

587
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,098
Well, I...
(CHUCKLES)

588
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:50,165
I just figured with everything
that's been going on,

589
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,731
it'd be nice.

590
00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:53,332
Yeah.

591
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,700
Right.

592
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:03,498

593
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:06,399

594
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,765

595
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,100
What?

596
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,968
What?

597
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,931
I miss you.

00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:18,567

601
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,765
Yeah.

602
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:26,965

604
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:31,035
Then let it happen.

605
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:34,765
You know, this is...

606
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,601
It's all just a wee bit
too fast for me.

607
00:37:38,899 --> 00:37:42,201

nothing's gonna get resolved.

610
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,464

Alice for dinner.

611
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:59,031

612
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:00,798

615
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,498
What?
Like you're surprised?

616
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:09,198
You knew about this?
Well, isn't it obvious?

617
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,731
When did this come?

618
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:14,100
Oh, that.

619
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,334

620
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:28,298

Sorry I was late.

630
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:03,065
I just wanted to check on you.

631
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,399
Are you okay?

632
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,631
Yeah, I'm...
I'm a little jumpy.

wrong with your eye?

634
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:14,564
I think there's something
caught in it or...

635
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:16,767
or, like, an allergic reaction.

Well...

637
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:23,332

looked at, because...

638
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,664
it looks super gross, man.

639
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:27,998

on the fucking news this morning

could be dangerous.
