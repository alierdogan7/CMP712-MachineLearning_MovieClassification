- Morning.
- Morning.

6
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,291
Reverend, thank you

Child narrating:
it was about three years ago.

9
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,214
I was the only kid
in church that day.

10
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,675
The others were with lsaac
out in the cornfield.

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,303
I didn't get to go
'cause Dad didn't like lsaac.

12
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,014
He was pretty smart, my dad.

13
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,269
After church, we went to Hansen's...
just like always.

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,354
Sarah was home sick with Mom.

15
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,690
She'd come down
with the fever real sudden.

16
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,611
- ( Child grunts )
- Man: Morning, Dave.

17
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,155
- Morning, Pop. How are you?
- How are the wife and Sarah?

18
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,866
Dad was worried, so he went
to call Mom first thing.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,744
Sarah's been better.
I'm going to call your mom, okay?

20
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,287
Okay.

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,498
Mr. Hansen:
I bet dad wants a cup of coffee.

22
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,253
- Okay, Joby, you want your usual?
- Yeah, strawberry shake.

23
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,881
That's when I saw
Malachai and the others.

24
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,550
I guess their meeting
with Isaac was over.

25
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,057
- Dave: Hi.
- They were acting real creepy.

26

- ( Sarah moaning )
- I'm worried, Dave.

31
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:46,582

from 101 to 104.

32
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,626
- Uh-huh.
- ( Bell rings )

33

34
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,888
Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,616
How are you?

36
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,202

( Joby narrating )
it happened everywhere in Gatlin that day.

54
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,544

- Mm.
- Ls that a proposal?

We've got a lot of driving to do today.

"the hell with it"?

I wanna grab a quick shower
before we go, okay?

105
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,873
You're making something
out of nothing.

106
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,543
Right. To me it's something;
to you it's nothing.

107
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,963
I'm just worried about
this internship, okay?

108
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,549
I've been working
for this for four years.

109
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,135
- I know.
- ( Sighs )

110
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,846
I do understand.

111

- Why do you have to be such a jerk about it?
- ( Chuckles )

112

who thought lsaac was weird.

115
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,354
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

116
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,773
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

117
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,859
He was pretty scared.
I wasn't.

118
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,695
- I'm scared!
- Me too!

119
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,280
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

120
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,783
I said I'd come back for you.
I promise.

121
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,619
- Can't we go with you, please?
- No!

122
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,954
I'd never make it with you two.

123
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,124
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be all right!

124
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,490
As long as nobody finds
them pictures you've been drawin'.

125
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,878
She can't help it.

126
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,672
That won't matter
to lsaac and Malachai.

127
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,633
They'll take it as a sign.

128
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,135
Anyways, you know crayons
and drawings are forbidden...

129
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,096
just like having
that record player.

130
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,890
But we like it.
Isaac doesn't let us do anything!

131
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,851
Well, you just better
mind him till I get back

132
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,979
or else you know what happens.

133
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,152
You're not going
through the corn, are ya?

134
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,655
- I can't go no other way.
- But what about...

135
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,281
I said it'll be all right!

136
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,575
Unless you tell
anybody I'm gone.

137
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,829
- We won't.
- Cross your heart? Hope to die?

138
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,580
All: Stick a needle
in your eye.

139
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,708
Okay, you know what
that means now?

140
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,337
If you tell, you're gonna
burn in the lake of fire for all eternity!

141
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,798
Make sure nobody's lookin'.

142
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,139

something that begins
with the letter C.

147

- Corn.
- Right.

148
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,364
So now we know...

149
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,367
the backroads are even less interesting
than the highway.

150
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,788
Maybe they've discovered music.

151

- Preacher: Halleluiah!
- Crowd: Halleluiah!

But there's no room
for the fornicator!

- Oh no room!
- Crowd: No room...

155

- for the homosexual!
- Both: No room!

156
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,601
- No room for the drug abusers!
- Both: Oh no, no room!

157
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,979
Amen! Peanut butter
and white bread!

158

There's no room
for the college graduate!

159
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,276
No room for people
who watch public television!

160

I wonder how it got in here.

170

Not me.

171

this one goes goes
to Grand Island,

173

00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,127
Where's this Gatlin
we've been seeing signs for?

175
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,963
It's not on here.

176
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,424
What do you mean?
It's gotta be on here somewhere.

177
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,675
Burt, look out!

178
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,638
- ( Tires screech )
- ( Screams )

179
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,353
( groans )

180
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,022
Hang on.

181
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,275
Let me check.
Let me check.

182
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,487
- Where, right there?
- Yeah.

183
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,865
- ( Gasps )
- It's just a bump.

184
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
Just try and relax.

185
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,664
That was an animal, right?

186
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
I got to go back there, okay?

187
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,543
Just stay here
and try and rest.

188
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,267
Come on, buddy.

189
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,896
Oh lord.

190
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,775
( Crow squawks )

191
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,111
ls... he...

192
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
Oh, yeah.

193
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,370
( Gasping )

194
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,040
- Oh my God!
- Easy, easy, easy. Come on.

195
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,251
Easy.

196
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,837
Take it easy.
Don't look at him.

197
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,469
Okay, now, listen to me.

198
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,805
There's something
very wrong here.

199
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,433
So I want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there,

200
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,678
Understand? Keep all the doors
locked until I get back.

201
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,396
- Why? Where are you going?
- I'll tell you when I get back.

202
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,773
- Just do what I say.
- Okay.

203
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,600
( Heavy breathing )

204
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,781
( indistinct chuckling )

205
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,675
( soft grinding )

206
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,363
Burt?

207
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,312
Burt?!

208
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,084
I'm so sorry.

209
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,544
( Screams )

210
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,756
- Vicky, come on.
- ( Panting ) Burt!

211
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,716
- Easy, calm down.
- I kneeled...

212
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,135
I kneeled down next to him.
He said...

213
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,180
it's okay.
Take it easy.

214
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,265
Just take it easy.
Relax.

215
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,185
You're okay.
You understand?

216
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,521
- Yeah.
- You're okay.

217
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,399
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

218
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,987
You're okay.

219
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,070
( Music playing )

220
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,406
Joby: Me and Sarah were playing
in our old house.

221
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,157
We played there lots.

222
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,368
Malachai said it was forbidden.

223
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,287
But I think that was 'cause
nobody ever asked him to play.

224
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,124
When I grow up,

225
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm gonna have all
the money in the world.

226
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,254
Me too.

227
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,756
- You can't.
- Why not?

228
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,260
- Because I'm gonna have it.
- I'll get it first.

229
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,720
- Will not.
- Will too!

230
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,179
- Will not!
- Will too!

231
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,597
Oh yeah, how?

232
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,858
It's easy.

233
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,777
Seven.

234
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:47,073
One, two, three, four, five,

235
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,117
six...
( coughs )

236
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,952
seven.

237
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,454
All right, see?

238
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,707
$200.

239
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,834
Uh-uh, Joby.

240
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,717
How much?

241
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,137
13 thousand hundred dollars.

242
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,639
13 thousand hundred dollars?

243
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,726
Uh, okay, $2,000.

244
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
Mm-hmm.
I thought so.

245
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,357
100, 200...

246
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,234
I got a great idea.

247
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,863
Let's pretend
this guy is lsaac.

248
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,782
And we're gonna
put him in jail.

249
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,160
What if he gets
a get-out-of-jail-free card?

250
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,162
Simple as that.

251
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,486
- What cards?
- ( Both laughing )

252
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,311
Do you think it might have been
some kind of accident,

253
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,063
like farm equipment
or something?

254
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,564
Not a wound like that.

255
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,401
His throat was cut
deliberately.

256
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,865
He was already dead
when he stumbled out into the road.

257
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,536
Whoever killed him...
do you think he saw us?

258
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,081
I mean, I felt like
we were being watched.

259
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,749
It's possible.

260
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,544
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

261
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,463
When I went to get the suitcase,
it was still fresh.

262
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,385
- Then he could have been out there.
- I couldn't leave it there.

263
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,470
I mean, what if it
holds some sort of clue?

264
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,560
- Let's open it.
- No.

265
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,355
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or someplace.

266
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,610
Joby: Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

267
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,863
I figured he finally
talked the little squirt

268
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,990
into punishing us
for being unbelievers.

269
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,076
Up till then, we'd been forgiven
'cause we weren't in the corn

270
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,996
the day He Who Walks Behind the Rows
made himself known.

271
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,248
That bothered Malachai.

272
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,833
He had a lot of problems.

273
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,084
( Footsteps )

274
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,386
I found these two
in one of the old homes.

275
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,598
They had a game and music.

276
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,727
And this.

277
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,857
They come already.

278
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,325
You have the gift of sight.

279
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,244
This is a blessing, my child.

280
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,413
Malachai: I've seen this car
upon the road.

281
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,040
Go to the old man.

282
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,709
Make sure
he tells them nothing.

283
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,169
What about these two?

284
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,761
Take them back where they were.

285
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,554
But they had a game and music.

286
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,641
- They're forbidden!
- Question me not, Malachai.

287
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,143
I act according to His will.

288
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,065
( Sarah grunts )

289
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,080
Ugh, you'd think
we were on the damn moon.

290
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,539
We haven't even seen a truck.

291
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,083
We'll be in Gatlin soon.

292
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,588
You think he lived there?

293
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,132
We may never know that.

294
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,511
I really think
we should open it.

295
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,848
Okay.

296
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,859
Let's see if I
can get some news.

297
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,987
Atone!

298
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,615
Preacher: Only by the blood
of the Lamb are we saved!

299
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm getting tired of that crap!

300
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,786
( Clasp releases )

301
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,251
- Ugh!
- What is it?

302
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,550
- Jesus Christ.
- Not in my book.

303
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,554
Looks like some kind
of primitive folk art.

304
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,431
I think it's repulsive.

305
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,814
Man:
Sarge, how about that number six?

306
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,365
Oh damn it.
Better make it an eight.

307
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,079
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

308
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:51,002
( Grunts )

309
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,756
Oh, good boy, Sarge,

310
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,633
We'll have that transmission
fixed in no time!

311
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,345
Then we'll get on the radiator.

312
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,724
Damn, this road
is becoming a regular highway.

313
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,186
Ain't this about the third car
in a month, huh?

314
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,105
We know what to do,
don't we, boy?

315
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,368
You'd better put
that suitcase away.

316
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,873
Be right back.

317
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,756
- Hi, we've had ourselves...
- I ain't got no gas.

318
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,759
- No, I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel if you all need it.

319
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,923
Burt: No, you don't understand.
I need to use your...

320
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,055
You don't buy no gas,
you can't use no restroom.

321
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,724
( Crow squawks )

322
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,476
Your telephone.
I need to use your phone.

323
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,353
Telephone?!
I ain't got no telephone.

324
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,896
- ( Dog barks )
- Sarge.

325
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,316
( Sarge continues barking )

326
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,901
Sarge, you be still now.

327
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,535
Mister,

328
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,329
what you want to do
is to go to Hemingford.

329
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,833
- About 19 miles down that right fork there.
- What about Gatlin?

330
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,585
Gatlin? There ain't
nothin' in Gatlin.

331
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,463
( Sarge barking )

332
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,507
What do you mean
there ain't nothing in Gatlin?

333
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,801
Folks in Gatlin's got religion.

334
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:26,013
They don't cotton to outsiders and
probably won't have a phone either.

335
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,600
Sarge! Mister, I'd like to stay here
and shoot the breeze with you

336
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,854
about politics and stuff,
but I got a transmission to fix.

337
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,898
You get on that right fork there
and you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

338
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,650
Right.

339
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,193
- ( Barks )
- Sarge.

340
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,487
I said at ease!

341
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,448
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
- ( Barks )

342
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,994
- ( whimpers )
- Sarge!

343
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,082
Either that man's senile or he's been
out in the sun too long.

344
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,418
Sarge!

345
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,171
- Come back here!
- ( Barking )

346
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,173
Sarge, get back here!

347
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,175
I don't have time for this.

348
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,930
You hear me?
Come back here.

349
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,642
Come on.
That's an order!

350
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,811
( Metal thuds )

351
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,108
( loud thunder )

352
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,448
Who is it?
Ls that you?

353
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,326
What do you want?

354
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,915
( Crow squawks )

355
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,676
( clanging )

356
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,428
What are you doing in there?

357
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,783
There really isn't that much stuff in here.
Just kid's stuff...

358
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,954
clothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

359
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,874
- I don't get it, camping stuff?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,629
Oh great.
This must be our day.

361
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,674
Didn't the last sign
we saw say Gatlin was three miles

362
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,968
- and point that way?
- That's what I thought.

363
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,303
Did I miss a turn?

364
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,180
No, we've been going straight.

365
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,309
Somebody's been messing
with these signs then.

366
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,272
- Hemingford's gotta be straight ahead.
- Yeah.

367
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,573
Must have been the wind.

368
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,854
Those latches
ain't worth a damn.

369
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,523
Blow over in a bad fart.

370
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,030
( Children's laughter )

371
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,325
( thunder )

372
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,038
I never told them nothing.

373
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,459
I swear it.
I kept our bargain just like always.

374
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,798
Burt:
Jesus Christ.

375
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,551
Gatlin! What do they have a monopoly
on road signs?

376
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,762
What about Hemingford?

377
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,432
For people who don't like visitors,
they sure do advertise enough.

378
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,479
Over there.

379
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,444
Of course, it's the wind.

380
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,243
( Grunting )

381
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,395
Why did you have
to go after them, Sarge?

382
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,991
Why you bastards.

383
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,327
You can't do this to me.

384
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,874
( Grunts )

385
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,940
I know you're in here.

386
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,614
Come on.

387
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,076
Come on!

388
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,174
I can smell you,
you stinkin' little skunks.

389
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,593
Come on!

390
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,436
You murdering little devils.

391
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,398
Come on!

392
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,671
( Thump )

393
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,007
Vicky:
What was that?

394
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,301
( Exhales )
That probably was just my golf bag.

395
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,137
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean am I sure?

396
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,998
God, this isn't even a road.

397
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,603
- We're never gonna get out of here.
- We will too, now stop it!

398
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,005
Sorry.

399
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,344
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.

400
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,943
We're right back
where we started from.

401
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,696
We never should have
listened to that old fool.

402
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,950
Hemingford's 19 miles.
Gatlin's only three.

403
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,714
I don't care how much religion
they've got,

404
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:45,907
we're going there right now.

405
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,124
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

406
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,270
Behold.

407
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,148
A dream did come to me in
the night.

408
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,902
And the Lord did show
all this to me.

409
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,779
Crowd: Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

410
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,574
A time of tribulation has come.

411
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,577
A test is at hand.

412
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,874
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

413
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,836
In the dream,
the Lord did come to me

414
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,630
And He was a shape.

415
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,424
It was He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

416
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,844
And I did fall
on my knees in terror,

417
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,471
and hide my eyes,

418
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,182
lest the fierceness of
His face strike me dead!

419
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,352
And He told me all
that has since happened.

420
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,229
- He said,
- ( Baby crying )

421
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,608
"Joseph has taken his things
and fled this happy place,"

422
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,445
because the worship
of Me is no more upon him.

423
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,533
"So take you his life
and spill his blood."

424
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,869
- He did?
- Yeah.

425
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,206
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

426
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,668
- "Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so it was done!

427
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,796
Joseph the betrayer
was cast out.

428
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,216
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say,

429
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,511
"I will send
outlanders amongst you,"

430
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,138
a man and a woman.

431
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,225
And these outlanders
will be unbelievers

432
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,685
"and profaners
of the holy."

433
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,396
I wish Isaac never came here.

434
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,814
But he's always been here,

435
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,733
just like He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

436
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,152
"And the man shall
sorely test you."

437
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,363
For he has great power,

438
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,157
"Even greater than
that of the blue man!"

439
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,995
Crowd: The blue man.
Yes, the blue man.

440
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,748
And just as the blue man
was offered up unto Him,

441
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,002
so shall be the unbelievers.

442
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,045
Malachai:
Make sacrifice unto Him.

443
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,298
Bring Him the blood
of the outlanders.

444
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,718
( All chanting )
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

445
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,512
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

446
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,432
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

447
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,101
Praise God!
Praise the Lord!

448
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,770
Praise God! Praise the Lord!

449
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,522
( Whispers )
Let's get out of here.

450
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,276
( Chanting continues )

451
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,941
it looks like a swinging place.

452
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,417
I guess nobody told them
we were coming.

453
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,670
- I hope not.
- ( Scoffs )

454
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,132
God, I don't see anybody.

455
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,681
Town hall.

456
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,309
Grocery store.

457
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,938
Hansen's Cafe.
Let's see if they've got a phone, huh?

458
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,525
- Unless a ghost is using it.
- ( Chuckles )

459
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,930
What is it with this corn?

460
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,224
You got me.

461
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,812
Phew.

462
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,831
( Hangs up phone ) It's dead.

463
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,583
Just like everything else
around here.

464
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,251
- ( Squeals )
- Yuck!

465
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,546
- A rat.
- Yeah.

466
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,382
Just your ordinary
coffee shop rat.

467
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,343
Now can we get
out of here, please?

468
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,513
Hey.

469
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,016
Hey hey, wait a minute.
Come back here!

470
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,727
Come on, Vicky.
Hurry up, I don't want to lose them.

471
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,529
( Tires screeching )

472
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,910
So what are you
gonna do if you catch them?

473
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,754
Ask them where
we could find help, what else?

474
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,248
- They cut off that way.
- Okay.

475
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
Burt:
Damn it. Where'd they go?

476
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,132
Look, we're already in the car.

477
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,135
Why don't we go on to Hemingford?
It'll take us 20 minutes.

478
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,637
We just found people.

479
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,640
Yeah, three kids who tried
to steal our car.

480
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,186
There's something
very strange about this town.

481
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,565
( Sighs ) Maybe you're right.

482
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
Burt: We'd be better off
in a bigger town anyway.

483
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,573
- The size of Seattle.
- Vicky: Yeah.

484
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,876
- Over there.
- What?

485
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,754
I just saw a door
open and close.

486
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,048
I didn't see anything.

487
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,676
Let's check it out.

488
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,761
Why? I thought
we were going!

489
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,554
Settle down.
Jeez.

490
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,307
- Don't patronize me, Burt.
- I'm not patronizing you.

491
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,643
I just want to see
if somebody's there.

492
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,526
Hello?

493
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,749
Anybody home?

494
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,213
We've had an accident and we need
to use your phone.

495
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,218
Okay?
Now can we go?

496
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,892
Burt, this is somebody's house!

497
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,519
I know, I just want
to use their phone.

498
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,521
Burt: Hello?

499
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,052
Gross.

500
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,222
I'm going to check out back.

501
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,571
I found the phone.

502
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,284
It matches the decor perfectly.

503
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,952
This is three years old.

504
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,667
I don't understand
what's going on here.

505
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,463
Well, can we go?

506
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,714
( Thump )

507
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,931
( whispers ) Burt.

508
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,118
Hello?

509
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,711
Ls anybody here?

510
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,924
( Stairs creaking )

511
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,526
( both gasp )

512
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:07,324
( guitar music playing )

513
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,547
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

514
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,841
Hi.

515
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,931
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

516
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,476
Oh, Sarah.
That's a beautiful name.

517
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,103
This is Burt and I'm Vicky.

518
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,647
Are you here alone, Sarah?

519
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,692
Do you live here?

520
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,155
You just come here to play?

521
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,785
Are your mommy
and daddy around?

522
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,205
- They're in the cornfield.
- Oh.

523
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,748
What are they doing there?

524
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,917
All the grown-ups
are there.

525
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,671
Are they working there
or are they having a meeting?

526
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,758
No, lsaac put them there.

527
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,260
Who's lsaac?

528
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,015
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell us who Isaac is.

529
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,017
Our leader.

530
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,602
Leader of what?

531
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,273
Of everybody.

532
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,650
Of course.

533
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,283
Listen, could you
take us to lsaac?

534

- Huh-uh.

535
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,203
He's scary.

536
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,789
Look, Sarah,
it's very important

537
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,292
that we speak to some
grown-ups as soon as possible.

538
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,043
We're wasting
our time here, Vicky.

539
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,920
Well, give her a chance.

540
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,964
I'm gonna go look
at the town hall.

541
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,883
Why?

542
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,803
Because we have
a murder to report.

543
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,973
And we're standing here
talking in circles wasting our time.

544
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,808
Maybe she can help.

545
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,727
Well, fine, then you
stay here with her.

546
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,608
Listen, things just
aren't happening fast enough.

547
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,943
So I'm gonna leave you the car.

548
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,403
I won't be gone very long.

549
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,156
If anybody comes,
just honk, okay?

550
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,287
Are we safe?

551
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,583
Yeah, it's a little weird
here, but it's safe.

552
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,210
I'll be back.

553
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,981
So looks like
it's just you and me.

554
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,153
What were you doing here by yourself?
Just playing records?

555
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,616
Come on, you can tell me.

556
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,121
- Drawing
- Drawing.

557
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,916
What's so secret about drawing?

558
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,210
I'm not supposed to.

559
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,170
You're not supposed to draw?

560
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,299
Who says?
Isaac?

561
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,259
Malachai.

562
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,345
Malachai?

563
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:17,639
Well, I'll tell you what.

564
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,015
Why don't you draw me a picture

565
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,768
And we won't tell Isaac
or Malachai or anybody?

566
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,354
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

567
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:46,472
- So how's it coming, huh?
- Fine.

568
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,393
- What did you draw?
- You.

569
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,479
You did?
Could I see?

570
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,033
What is this?

571
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,160

572

Burt?

573
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:24,378
Burt, is that you?

574
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,322
Vicky:
ls somebody here?

575
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,203
Who are you?

576
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,498
What do you want?

577
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,963
We want to give you peace.

578
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,967
Seize her.

579
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,635
Boy:
Come on, get her.

580
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,107
Come out of there.

581
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,278

582
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,798

Burt! No!

585
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,604
Vicky's voice:
Are we safe?

586
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,274
Burt's voice:
it's weird here, but it's safe.

587
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,652
( Both voices repeating )

588
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:06,029
Vicky.

589
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,788
( Vicky screaming ) Help me!

590
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,082
Where are you taking me?

591
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,087
Burt!

592
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,715
- Burt! No!
- ( Sarah crying )

593
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,605
Vicky!

594
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,946
Sarah, what happened here, huh?

595
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,325
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

596
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,660
You've gotta think.
Now think.

597
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,245
What happened to her, please?

598
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,919
Does He speak to you, Isaac?

599
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:06,089
He speaks to me always.

600
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,341
But today He is displeased.

601
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:12,011
He is displeased
with you, Malachai.

602
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,846
What have I done?

603
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,099
Question Him not in vain.

604
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,060
Do you not know you did sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

605
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,188
And did you not
spill the blood of the old man

606
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,774
when his oil and gasoline were
still useful to us?

607
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,193
We have our own
fuel now from the corn.

608
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,863
Show not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

609
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,036
Maybe He is displeased
we have not offered Him Sarah and Job.

610
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,789
Sarah has the gift of sight.

611
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,543
She warned us of the coming
of the interlopers.

612
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,212
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.

613
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,840
I am the giver of His word.

614
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,886
Go you and bring me
the husband.

615
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,514
I must offer them tonight
when Amos leaves.

616
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,437
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her, please.

617
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,316
Sarah, look at me.
Now think.

618
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,152
- ( Whispers ) Malachai.
- What?

619
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,530
- Malachai.
- Who's Malachai? What do you mean?

620
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,657
Huh?

621
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,127
No.

631

Now the blood
of Amos will be shared!

632

You got a pretty sick way
of celebrating it, pal.

638

- Listen, I...
- Silence, interloper!

639
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,966
Your presence does
profane this holy place.

640
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,968
He will reckon with you!

641
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,928
That's terrific.
I don't know who he is,

642
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,848
but maybe he'd like to discuss the medical
side of what's going on here with me.

643
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,016
- It's as it should be.
- Amos!

01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,645
I know a place to hide.

702
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,063
But we gotta hurry.

703
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,065
- Who are you?
- Job.

704
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,609
Come on.
Stop asking questions.

705
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,991
Come on.

706
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,954
Will you come on?

707
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,388
Careful.

708
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,973
Hey, don't be a scaredy cat.

709
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:05,104
- Come on. it's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

710
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,439
Yeah, my sister.

711
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,779
Isn't this neat?
My dad built it

712
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,490
for when the communists
launch their first strike.

713
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,036
I don't think it's the communists
we have to worry about.

714
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,331
Don't worry.
Nobody knows about this place.

715
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,334
It's secret.

716
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,837
- Are those guys friends of yours?
- No way.

717
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,548
They listen to lsaac
and Malachai.

718
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,967
Who are lsaac and Malachai?

719
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,094
Isaac started the whole thing.

720
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,972
If he hadn't had come,
this would never have happened.

721
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,100
When he was young, he was a preacher,
so everybody believed him.

722
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,811
They thought he had
great spirit.

723
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,313
I thought he was weird,
huh, Sarah?

724
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,785
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

725
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,496
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

726
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,748
She'll bring the man to us.

727
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,876
No, he must be
taken without her.

728
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,920
We cannot remove her
from this place. it is holy.

729
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,298
We will bring the Lord
two by using one.

730
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,508
Do not blaspheme, Malachai!

731
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,636
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.

732
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:22,973
I think not, Isaac.
You're the one who's lost favor with Him.

733
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,435
He's the god of blood and sacrifice,
not ceremony.

734
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,313
Ah, sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

735
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,939
Shut your mouth, lsaac.

736
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,025
You've grown prideful
and apart from us.

737
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,569
Girl:
Oh my gosh. Oh no.

738
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:38,197
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
will decide your fate.

739
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,575
Don't just sit there.
Seize him!

740
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,077
Punish him!
Cut him down! I command you!

741
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,872
I am the word and the giver
of His laws.

742
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,208
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

743
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,878
Do it now or your punishment shall be
a thousand times a thousand deaths.

744
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,713
Each more horrible
than the last.

745
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,715
They are tired
of your talk, lsaac.

746
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,258
I have shown them
what I can do.

747
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,552
Cut the woman down.

748
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,387
Put lsaac in her place.

749
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,890
You will see how
the Lord favors you.

750
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,059
No, you dare not.
You blaspheme.

751
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,520
He will punish you.
The god of hell will devour you.

752
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,689
All of you! No!

753
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,193
( Screaming )

754
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,362
When my dad wouldn't get up,

755
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:21,365
I ran from Hansen's
to get Officer Hotchkiss.

756
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,742
But I was too late.

757
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,744
Why, what happened to him?

758
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,704
He got away...
that time.

759
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,916
Then he went down to the barn
after he talked to the minister.

760
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,961
The minister?
What happened to the minister?

761
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,295
Malachai.

762
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:41,134
Malachai:
Outlander!

763
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,513
Outlander!

764
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,517
Get over there.
He's gonna come. Get over there.

765
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,855
- Boy: You come with me down this street.
- Outlander!

766
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,276
Outlander!

767
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,530
We have your woman.
She still lives.

768
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,201
Outlander, maybe you don't
hear so well.

769
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,704
( Screams ) Burt!

770
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,165
Outlander, her blood will spill

771
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,251
unless you give yourself up.

772
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,129
We won't wait much longer.

773
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:21,174
Night is coming.
Night is His time.

774
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,427
Outlander!

775
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,095
Come on!
Come on!

776
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,472
Come on, outlander!

777
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,058
( Faintly echoing ) Come on!

778
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,603
Outlander!

779
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,942
Are you looking for that lady?

780
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,611
Yeah, you know where she is?

781
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,739
- They took her out to the clearing.
- What clearing? Where?

782
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,824
In the cornfield.

783
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,452
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

784
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,871
- I followed them like I followed you.
- Show me.

785
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,709
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

786
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:56,835
Okay.

787
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,859

- ( Whispers ) Quiet.

789

Follow me to the barn.

790
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,478
Careful.

791
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,369
I'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

792
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,621
Isaac:
Malachai, He will not forgive you!

793
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,790
None of you will be forgiven!

794
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,708
All of you
shall feel His wrath!

795
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,877
- ( Screaming continues )
- We have a surprise for you, Amos.

796
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,338
You morons. Don't you understand
what he's trying to do?

797
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,298
Isaac's going
to keep you company.

798
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,425
He Who Walks Behind the Rows
will decide your fate.

799
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,220
I am the word and the giver
of His laws!

800
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,847
This is the end!

801
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,584

Okay, you two.

and wait for me, all right?

806
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,153
But if anything happens to me,

you get to Hemingford
as fast as you can.

808

and don't get off, understand?

Joby, get some help
and get those doors closed, quick.

877
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,804
- Joby: Peter, Robert, come on.
- Vicky: What do we do?

878
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,305
Burt:
I don't know.

879
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,265
If I knew what it was,
I could tell you.

880
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,352
It's He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

881
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,979
What if we tried to run for it
and make it to the road?

882
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,565
I think we're
safer here for now.

883
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,653
( Screaming )

884
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,658
Joby, has anybody
ever tried to hurt the monster?

885
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,660
Any of the adults?
The parents before they were killed?

886
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,078
The blue man.

887
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,247
Who's the blue man?
What did he do?

888
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,666
Officer Hotchkiss.
I told you.

889
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,585
He came down here after
he talked to the minister.

890
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,171
He was reading a page
torn out of the Bible

891
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,424
- and he was working with the still.
- Wait a minute.

892
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:24,676
( All scream )

893
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,015
Why was he reading out of the Bible?
What was it?

894
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:30,515
Do you know?
You have it?

895
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:32,684
Hurry up.
Where is it?

896
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,020
Child:
it's all Malachai's fault!

897
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,022
"And the devil
that deceived them"

898
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,442
was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone

899
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:44,612
where the beast and the false prophet
are and shall be tormented

900
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:47,115
"day and night
forever and ever."

901
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,450
What's that supposed to mean?

902
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:57,375
Job, what was
the blue man doing at the still?

903
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,087
He hooked the hose up
to it and was trying to roll it out.

904
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:04,382
- What stopped him?
- Both: Malachai.

905
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:08,344
"Lake of fire." Fire!
He was going to burn the field.

906
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:12,182
Oh, yes.
The gasohol. The still.

907
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,142
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.

908
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,312
You kids, get me as many hoses
as you can find, quick!

909
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,399
Job and Sarah,
find me a bottle, a glass one.

910
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,526
A pop bottle.
Quick, move.

911
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:25,403
Vicky, come here.

912
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:29,365
- Child ♪2: Over here.
- Child ♪3: I can't find anything.

913
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,079
( Child screams )

914
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,998
it doesn't fit.

915
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,501
There's gotta be a connector
around here somewhere.

916
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,545
Try these.

917
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,310
Get somebody
to hold this on tight.

918
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,271
- Okay!
- Hang on to it.

919
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,232
You got one, good.

920
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:07,946
Vicky, see if you can find me
a thick rag.

921
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,781
Joby, come here.

922
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,867
Hey, that's not a rag.

923
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:17,539
Sheesh.

924
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,166
Okay.

925
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:23,503
Now get them to hold
onto that tight.

926
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,256
- Open it up when I get out there, all right?
- All right.

927
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,509
Burt, be careful.

928
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:33,054
- I love you, Vicky.
- Child: I wish we'd never done this.

929
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,139
Okay.

930
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,791
Ow.

931
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,336
Ow!

932
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,134
( Grunting )

933
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:24,105
( creature howling )

934
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:35,533
What are you doing here?
Get back to the barn. Hurry up.

935
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:39,120
Go on, move. Now.

936
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,294
Excuse me.

937
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,775
Joby, get that valve.

938
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,027
Quick.

939
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,830
Joby, do you know how
to run this thing?

940
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,041
- Crank it.
- What?

941
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,376
Crank it.

942
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:37,679
Push the button at the top.

943
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:39,889
Yeah.

944
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
All right.

945
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,289
- Get the bottle.
- Okay.

946
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,434
Come here.
Block the wind.

947
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,651
( Grunts )

948
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,661
Joby! Joby!
Come back here.

949
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,079
You'll get killed.

950
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,715
Joby!

951
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:06,476
Run. Come on.
Run, Joby.

952
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,520
Here's the bottle!

953
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,815
Throw it.
Throw right this time.

954
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,486
Throw it.
Throw it.

955
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,467
Burt!

956
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:47,975
- Sarah: Joby!
- Burt!

957
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,019
Joby!

958
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,481
- Burt: Vicky! Vicky!
- Joby: Sarah!

959
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,400
Sarah: Joby!

960
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:57,902
Joby!

961
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,657
( Creature growling )

962
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,202
Look! Look!

963
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,509
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

964
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:37,233
- Joby: ls He dead?
- Burt: I think so.

965
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,404
- Then why are we still running?
- Just keep going.

966
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,656
Vicky:
Where did you get this guy?

967
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,981
( Sighs )
Well, Hemingford's 19 miles, right?

968
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,651
Vicky:
You mean walk?

969
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,069
Sure.

970
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,071
Burt, are you sure
you're strong enough?

971
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:26,073
I'm okay.

972
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,117
What about you?
Are you okay?

973
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,703
Yeah, I'll make it.

974
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,580
I got a great doctor.

975
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,416
You better believe it.

976
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,836
( Both giggling )

977
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,635
- Jealous?
- ( All laugh )

978
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,803
What are we gonna do
with these two little munchkins, huh?

979
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,263
Burt:
Oh, I don't know.

980
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:51,766
You guys want to come live with us
for a couple days?

981
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:55,353
- Hmm?
- How about a week?

982
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,730
( Children laughing )

983
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,399
- Okay.
- How about a month?

984
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:02,526
No.

985
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,403
All right.
All right.

986
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,031
I'll grab the map.

987
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,283
- Ever been to Seattle?
- Sarah: What's Seattle?

988
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:17,917
Interloper!

989
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,168
- Girl: No!
- ( Grunts )

990
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,966
You must die.
( grunts )

991
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,135
Oh, boy.

992
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:34,642
Oh, she's out cold.

993
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,687
What are we gonna do now?

994
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,689
Send her a get-well
card from Seattle.

995
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:41,440
Let's get the hell out of here.
