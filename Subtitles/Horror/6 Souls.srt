When we were walking home from
church on Christmas Eve.

184

Not at all.

Mm-hm.

Nope.

No.

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,035
No. This is their natural colour.

218

So I believe, as a child,

486
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,520
Adam Saber began carrying around
a mental picture of David

487
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,480
so that no matter where he went,
no matter how horrific things became,

488
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,440
there was always someone
who had it worse -

But to benefit from this mental image,

492
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
he must be fully aware of it

493

cannot be disassociated.

629
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,360
Why, Dad? Why?
Why do you do this to me?

630
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,680
Because you 've stopped
asking questions.

631
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,920
That's all I do. That's all I do all day long.

That's all I do, Dad.
No, no!

633
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,840
You 've stopped asking questions
of yourself, Caroline!

634
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,720
You 've developed
this fixed system of beliefs

635
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,760
which you refuse to submit
to any kind of introspection.

636
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,240
So what that means is
that you will never have

637
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,160
a new thought in your professional life.

638
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,400
You have got to learn to
take those ideas, set them to one side

639
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,480
and try to move ahead with
one big question, which is, "Why?"!

640
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,360
And simply ask, "What?"
To just say, "I don't know."

641
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,400
Just because you 're older,
it doesn't mean you 're right.

642
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,595
It might mean
that you 've been wrong for longer.

643
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,640
What has been your motivation here?

644
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,400
Has it been to help Adam
to discover whatever...

645
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,520
...crisis it is that caused him
to fracture his psyche?

646
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,230
Or has it been to simply flat out
prove me wrong?

647
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,393

in solitary confinement.
