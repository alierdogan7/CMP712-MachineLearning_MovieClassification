1
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,656
Dr. Barrett?

2
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,107
My people tell me

3
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,271
you're among
the best five in your field.

4
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,609
Your fee will be
L1 00,000.

5
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,616
Your assignment:
to establish the facts.

6
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,049
Regarding what?

7
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,144
Survival after death.

8
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,483
You want--

9
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,615
To know ifit's factual.

10
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,524
What would convinceyou
eitherway?

11
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,528
Give me the facts.

12
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:40,429
Where can I fi nd
these facts?

13
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,399
In 20 years ofstudy--

14
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,267
You'll fi nd them
in the only place

15
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,966
where survival hasn't
yet been refuted.

16
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,804
The Belasco House.

17
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,174
Hell House?

18
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,310
Hell House.

19
00:01:56,381 --> 00:02:00,317
The Belascos sealed it up
afterwhat happened.

20
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:03,377
20 years ago.
They need money now.

21
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,389
I've bought the place.

22
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,425
Can you be there
Monday?

23
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,392
Well, can you?

24
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,792
Yes.

25
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,888
There'll be two others.

26
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,455
Florence Tanner--

27
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,331
Tanner?
But she's a mental medium.

28
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,894
Yes. I want that
approach employed, too.

29
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,907
She's practically a child.

30
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,909
My people tell me

31
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,913
she's the best
in her field, too.

32
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,744
And the other one?

33
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:35,412
The only survivor
from the last attempt.

34
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,216
Fischer?

35
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,918
I expect an answer
within a week.

36
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,119
A week?

37
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,822
Take it or leave it.

38
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,779
I have a list
ofall phenomena

39
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,372
recorded at
the Belasco House,

40
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,383
restoration ofelectricity,

41
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,214
transportation of
your equipment.

42
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,879
Is that it?

43
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,890
No. There's a partially
constructed machine.

44
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,892
How long before
it's complete?

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,396
Depends on how many
electronics experts you use.

46
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,897
How soon
will you need it?

47
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,399
Wednesday.

48
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,900
Good day.

49
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:33,911
It would be better
ifyou didn't come.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,415
But I always
come with you.

51
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,782
I don't want
to be left alone.

52
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,912
I want to be there

53
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,924
when you prove
your new theory.

54
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:50,519
Isn't itjust another
so-called haunted house?

55
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,928
It's the Mount Everest
ofhaunted houses.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,936
There were two attempts
to investigate it.

57
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,871
Both were disasters.
Eight people died.

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,170
Fischerwas
the only survivor.

59
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:07,177
He crawled out
a mental wreck.

60
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,401
These are the house keys.

61
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,404
Your luggage
and equipment

62
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,406
has already
been installed.

63
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,409
Electricity's on.
Your rooms are ready.

64
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,411
There's a full larder.

65
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,414
I'll return
at 5:00 on the 24th.

66
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,807
Look at the windows.

67
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:09,812
He had them bricked up
so no one could see in.

68
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,313
Or out.

69
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,337
It's hideous.

70
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:39,341
We're not even insideyet,
Miss Tanner.

71
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,900
I don't have to be.

72
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,357
[Trying Light Switch]

73
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,359
So much for electricity.

74
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,361
There's a generator?

75
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:00,396
Yes.

76
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,301
My God, that smell.

77
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,307
The atmosphere in here.

78
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,812
Ofthis world,
not the next.

79
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,315
This house...

80
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,318
it knows we're here.

81
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,320
Miss Tanner.

82
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,821
Sorry.

83
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,824
I'll keep my observations
to myself.

84
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:34,830
Doyou know where
the emergency generator is?

85
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:50,838
I hope
I didn't disturbyou.

86
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:55,851
It'sjust that I'm concerned
foryou coming here.

87
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,012
Yes, I understand.

88
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,051
I wonder ifyou do.

89
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,856
Just how wealthy
was Mr. Belasco?

90
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:37,860
I believe he left millions
when he died.

91
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,866
Died?

92
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:47,335
Ifthere's anything
you'd care to tell us...

93
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,872
What's to tell?

94
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,875
The house tried
to kill me.

95
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,377
It almost succeeded.

96
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,955
That leads to the cellars,
Mr. Fischer?

97
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,456
That's right.

98
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:15,925
What's through there?

99
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,694
The chapel.

100
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,100
Chapel?

101
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,948
Sorry.
I can't right now.

102
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,224
We understand.

103
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,682
Welcome tomyhouse.

104
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,184
I'm delighted
youcouldcome.

105
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:13,689
I'm certainyou will find
yourstaymostilluminating.

106
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,318
Think ofme
asyour unseenhost...

107
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,699
Why couldn't
Miss Tanner come in?

108
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,203
Her system is attuned
to psychic energy.

109
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,262
Obviously,
it's very strong in here.

110
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,334
A church in hell,
that sort ofthing.

111
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,347
Why doesn't it
affect him?

112
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,350
Obviously,
he protects himself

113
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,613
better than she does.

114
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,861
Miss Tanner.

115
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,867
Miss Tanner?

116
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,869
I'm sure it's nothing.

117
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,302
Areyou?

118
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:21,274
Miss Tanner?

119
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:23,277
I'm over here.

120
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,547
You shouldn't
have done that,

121
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,107
Miss Tanner.

122
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,279
You caused us
undue alarm.

123
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,153
I heard a voice in here.

124
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,523
Welcome tomyhouse.

125
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,755
I'm delighted
youcouldcome.

126
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,766
I'm certainyou will find
yourstaymostilluminating.

127
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,860
Think ofme
asyour unseenhost.

128
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,531
Believe thatduring
yourstayhere,

129
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,540
Ishallbe withyou

130
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,200
in spirit.

131
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,178
Mayyoufind
theansweryouseek.

132
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,613
Itis here, Ipromiseyou.

133
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:05,141
Andnow,
aufwiedersehen.

134
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,160
Aufwiedersehen.

135
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:15,253
''Till we meet again.''

136
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,491
The record wasn't for us.

137
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,361
What made
the record go on?

138
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:26,134
Belasco said
he could will people

139
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,644
to a particular object,

140
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,841
then move among them
unobserved.

141
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,815
I doubt that.

142
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,819
Doyou?

143
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,826
Our attention was on that
a few moments ago.

144
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:50,593
How doyou know
he didn't walk right by us?

145
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:06,781
This house hasn't lived up
to its reputation so far.

146
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,783
It hasn't taken
our measureyet.

147
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,082
Don't consider the house
the haunting force.

148
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:16,146
Quite evidently,
the problem is created

149
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,658
by multiple
surviving personalities.

150
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:25,165
I take ityou don't believe in
survival, Dr. Barrett.

151
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,667
Ifyou mean
surviving personalities,

152
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,169
you're correct.

153
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,171
We will see.

154
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,173
Indeed we shall.

155
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,675
When was
the house built?

156
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,678
I don't know.

157
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,179
Mr. Fischer?

158
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,444
1 91 9.

159
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:46,214
You seem to know
a lot about Belasco.

160
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,689
Would you mind
sharing it with us?

161
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,693
His fi rst name
was Emeric.

162
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,196
He was born
on March 23, 1 879,

163
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,357
the illegitimate son

164
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,867
ofan American
munitions maker.

165
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,131
What did he look like?

166
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,638
His was
a frightening visage,

167
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,141
the face ofa demon

168
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,474
that had taken on
some human aspect.

169
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,640
Areyou quoting?

170
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,775
Yes, I am.

171
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,149
That is his second wife.

172
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,156
She committed suicide
in this room in 1 927.

173
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:27,151
How tall was he?

174
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,162
He was 6'5''.

175
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,960
They called him
the Roaring Giant.

176
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,160
What did he do

177
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:38,171
to make this house
so evil, Mr. Fischer?

178
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,675
Drug addiction,
alcoholism,

179
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,176
sadism,

180
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,677
bestiality,

181
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,407
mutilation,

182
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:48,676
murder, vampirism,
necrophilia, cannibalism,

183
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,050
not to mention
a gamut ofsexual goodies.

184
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,055
Shall I go on?

185
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,591
How did it end?

186
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,221
Ifit had ended,
we would not be here.

187
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:04,993
It's about to end,
Mr. Fischer.

188
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:18,469
What happened
to Mr. Belasco?

189
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:22,149
No one knows.

190
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,651
When relatives
ofthe guests

191
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:28,155
had this house
broken into in 1 929,

192
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:31,659
they found
all 27 ofthem dead.

193
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,853
Belasco wasn't
among them.

194
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,998
Ifno one objects,

195
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,159
I'll try a sitting tonight.

196
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,169
I have no objection.

197
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:44,671
Would you care to sit

198
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:47,173
in the morning,
Mr. Fischer?

199
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,176
I'm not readyyet.

200
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,184
Spirit oflove
and tenderness,

201
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:02,121
we gather here tonight
to communicate with those

202
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,125
who walk this house
in torment.

203
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:07,127
Help us to bridge

204
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,130
the chasm ofdeath
so faithfully

205
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:13,133
that pain is transformed
intojoy,

206
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,135
sorrow into peace.

207
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,137
All this we ask

208
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,641
in the name
ofour Infi nite Father.

209
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,142
Amen.

210
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:52,673
This is an evil house,

211
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,175
a place ofsickness.

212
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:58,735
Evil!

213
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,119
Extremes.

214
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:08,121
Limits.

215
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:12,455
Terminations
and extremities.

216
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,129
I don't know.

217
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:19,132
''Ifthine eye offend thee...''

218
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:22,635
Yes.

219
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,639
Yes.

220
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,144
There is a young man.

221
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,305
Veryyoung.

222
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,707
Says he must speak.

223
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,812
Must speak.

224
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:51,096
[In Spirit's Voice]
I don't knowyou people.

225
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,702
Why areyou here?

226
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,169
It does no good.

227
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,570
Nothing changes.

228
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,075
Nothing.

229
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:05,112
Get out or I'll hurtyou.

230
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,114
I can't help myself.

231
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:10,618
God damn you,
you fi lthy sons ofbitches.

232
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,701
God damn you!

233
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,571
I don't want to hurtyou,

234
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,074
but I must, I must.

235
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:25,079
Get out ofthis house
before I kill you all!

236
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:36,591
[Pounding]

237
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,624
You started manifesting
physical phenomena.

238
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:15,129
But I'm not
a physical medium.

239
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,131
You werejust now.

240
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,599
The embryo ofone.

241
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,901
I don't understand.

242
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,584
All this time
a mental medium,

243
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,586
and now this.

244
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,020
The Lord certainly
does move

245
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,024
in mysterious ways.

246
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,685
So does this house.

247
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,606
Back to normal.

248
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,609
Those pounding noises
are a bit unnerving

249
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,544
the fi rst time
you hear them.

250
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,055
Whywas Miss Tanner
so disturbed by that sitting?

251
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,455
Because she caused
physical phenomena.

252
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,494
If Miss Tanner
is a mental medium

253
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,496
and Mr. Fischer
a physical medium,

254
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:27,592
how can you be sure she created
those noises, not Fischer?

255
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,006
I can't.

256
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:35,510
In fact, I'm not at all sure

257
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:38,512
about Mr. Fischer
or Miss Tanner.

258
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,486
Who is it, please?

259
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,494
You want
to speak to me?

260
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,161
Areyou the one

261
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:38,172
that warned us
to get out?

262
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,012
Yes, it is you, isn't it?

263
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,517
You must give me
some sign.

264
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,524
You're not Belasco,
areyou?

265
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,465
Such a pain
would not be in Belasco.

266
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:07,468
I feel your anguish.

267
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,473
Who areyou?

268
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:15,976
Daniel?

269
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,981
Daniel Belasco.

270
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,490
Very clever.

271
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,493
Ifyou're that clever,

272
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:36,497
why areyou still
a prisoner in this house?

273
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:42,504
[Weeping]

274
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,017
Good morning.

275
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,518
Good morning.

276
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:02,454
You slept well?

277
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,458
Fine. And you?

278
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,960
Yes, verywell, thankyou.

279
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,465
I think I have
a partial answer

280
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,466
to the haunting, Doctor.

281
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,901
Thatyoung man that
warned us during the sitting

282
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,872
came to my room last night.

283
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:20,533
Belasco's son.

284
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:21,974
Yes.

285
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,568
Daniel Belasco.

286
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:25,977
He's veryyoung
and frightened.

287
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,982
Because he's
so frightened,

288
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,984
he's very hostile.

289
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,987
IfI convince him
to move on,

290
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,990
the haunting force
will be eliminated.

291
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,492
Do so by all means.

292
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,259
I'd like to suggest
another sitting,

293
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:46,096
under scientific
conditions this time.

294
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,010
Miss Tanner
in apparent trance.

295
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,515
Pulse rate 85,
respiration 1 5.

296
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,950
Four electric contacts
maintained.

297
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,956
No change in temperature.
Steady at 73.2.

298
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:16,464
Dynamometer reading
decreased to 1 823 now.

299
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,465
Temperature lowering.

300
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,967
Now it's 69.6 degrees.

301
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:25,473
Pulse rate 94.5
and rising.

302
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,476
Temperature drop
now 1 2.3 degrees.

303
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:36,245
Dynamometer reading
reduced to 1 779.

304
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:38,479
Pressurometer negative.

305
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,490
Electric contacts
still maintained.

306
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,494
Rate ofbreath increasing.

307
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:48,995
50.

308
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,497
57.

309
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:51,998
60.

310
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:55,001
Rising steadily.

311
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,004
[Clicking]

312
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:02,697
Infrared rays broken.
Cameras activated.

313
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:08,296
Evidence ofelectromagnetic
radiation commencing.

314
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,737
Medium's respiration 21 0.

315
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,942
Dynamometer 1 460.

316
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,910
Temperature...

[Clicking]

318
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,916
Evidence ofozone
in the air.

319
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,915
Ectoplasm forming.

320
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:50,439
Separate fi laments exuding
from fi ngertips ofboth hands

321
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:54,949
uniting to form
two separate strands.

322
00:26:56,518 --> 00:26:59,453
Two strands moving
toward each other.

323
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:11,893
Ectoplasmic stalk through net,
moving toward table.

324
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:25,773
Leave a sample, please.

325
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:35,546
Leave a sample in thejar.

326
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:43,595
Aah!

327
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:45,132
Aah!

328
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,929
Hold it.

329
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,445
She's all right.

330
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:10,390
Miss Tanner
coming out oftrance.

331
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,392
Premature retraction
ofectoplasm

332
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,896
causing brief
systemic shock.

333
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:20,401
Conclusion ofsitting,
2:48 P.M.

334
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,405
I spoiled your sitting,
didn't I?

335
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:27,407
Not at all.

336
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:29,909
I couldn't be
more satisfied.

337
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:36,416
Take a look.

338
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:41,421
What is it?

339
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:45,425
A specimen ofthat teleplasm
prepared in water.

340
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:51,932
What the spiritualists
refer to as ectoplasm

341
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,936
is derived almost entirely
from the medium's body,

342
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,938
the remainder
being admixtures

343
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,440
from the air,
the medium's costume,

344
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,373
fi brous remains,
dust particles.

345
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:05,709
But the bulk is
organic living matter,

346
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,910
an organic externalization
ofthought--

347
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,919
Mind reduced to matter.

348
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:16,081
She made that figure
from herself?

349
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,245
I was visited
by Belasco's son

350
00:30:12,313 --> 00:30:14,247
again this afternoon.

351
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:15,748
Wereyou?

352
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,546
Will it never end?

353
00:30:20,622 --> 00:30:23,022
Will what never end?

354
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:25,889
Your attitude ofdoubt
and distrust.

355
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,396
Why should mediums
be expected to perform

356
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:32,399
only under conditions
that science dictates?

357
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,492
We're not machines!

358
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:38,232
I'm not a medium for fun.

359
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:40,001
Doyou think--

360
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,008
I believe mediumship

361
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:44,408
is God's manifestation
in man.

362
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:48,916
''When I speak to thee,
I will open thy mouth

363
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,417
''and thou shalt say
unto thee,

364
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:53,420
thus saith the Lord. ''

365
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:55,422
There's nothing
in the Bible

366
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,321
that doesn't occur today,

367
00:30:57,392 --> 00:30:59,917
be it sights or sounds,

368
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:01,928
coming through

It was Belasco's son.

00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,286
He's like a general
with his army--

557
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:55,287
Never entering the battle,

558
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:57,346
but always controlling it.

559
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,247
Just what haveyou
been doing,

560
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,748
Mr. Fischer?

561
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,249
Hmm?

562
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,752
Haveyou been drinking?

563
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,758
I don't think that's
any ofyour business,

564
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:38,059
although I do think
it's a very good idea.

565
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:39,723
Come on.

566
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,062
No.

567
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:43,227
You come on.

568
00:48:46,306 --> 00:48:48,240
Mrs. Barrett.

569
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:51,004
Yes...Ben?

570
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:56,249
You should not leave
your husband alone.

571
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:59,752
Oh, I think he's all right.

572
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,754
He's sleeping.

573
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:07,693
Mrs. Barrett,
you must go back upstairs.

574
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:16,258
Did you know that this was
where it all happened?

575
00:49:16,336 --> 00:49:19,703
Where all what happened?

576
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:28,714
All that debauchery
and vice.

577
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:32,217
Right here.

578
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:34,719
Right around
this very table.

579
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:36,221
Mrs. Barrett,

580
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:38,223
you don't know
whatyou're saying.

581
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,225
Oh, yes, I do.

582
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:44,229
I know exactly
what I'm saying,

583
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:47,232
Mr. Fischer.

584
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,235
Mr. B.F. Fischer.

585
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:52,737
Mrs. Barrett,
it's this house.

586
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:54,740
It's making you--

587
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:57,242
This house isn't
doing anything.

588
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,108
I'm doing it.

589
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:06,047
Touch me,

590
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,247
or I'll fi nd
somebodywho will!

591
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:11,916
No!

592
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:13,118
No!

593
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,753
Oh.

594
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:23,268
I knowyou won't
forgive me...now.

595
00:50:23,336 --> 00:50:25,770
I know what I did.

596
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,774
I'd give anything
to undo it.

597
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:37,783
I just don't know
why I went down those stairs.

598
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,786
I knew what I was doing.

599
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:45,291
I knew,
but at the same time...

600
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,806
I'm not asking you
to forgive me,

601
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:04,241
but please, please
don't hate me.

602
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,745
I need you.

603
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,247
I loveyou.

604
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:13,252
I just don't understand
what's happening to me.

605
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,756
I just don't understand.

606
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,261
It's all right.

607
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,267
It'll pass after
we've left this house.

608
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,754
I loveyou, too.

609
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:43,189
Doctor, I think
yourwife is in danger.

610
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:44,698
Mr. Fischer.

611
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:47,200
It was not her fault.

612
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:49,203
Please, Mr. Fischer.

613
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:53,207
This is a matter
oflife and death.

614
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:56,210
She walked down here
last night.

615
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:57,711
When?

616
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:59,212
Near midnight.

617
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:01,215
You were asleep.

618
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:03,217
So was she.

619
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:05,651
She walked in her sleep?

620
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:07,154
Yes.

621
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:09,656
You should have told me.

622
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:12,159
No, Doctor.
She should have.

623
00:52:12,227 --> 00:52:14,661
The fact that she didn't...

624
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,164
I don't thinkyou know

625
00:52:17,232 --> 00:52:20,167
what's going on
in this house.

626
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,669
What I think
is irrelevant.

627
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:26,674
What the hell doyou mean
by irrelevant?

00:52:26,742 --> 00:52:29,677

atyourwife

629
00:52:29,745 --> 00:52:34,182

to Miss Tanner and toyou.

You're blocking yourselfoff
completely.

631
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:41,189
Mr. Deutsch is wasting
a third ofhis money.

You're blockingyourselfoff

645
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:12,043
Give up.

646
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:13,637
Give up?

647
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:17,651
What's happened?

648
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:21,655
I thought
we trusted each other.

649
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:27,161
I don't trust anyone
or anything.

650
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,167
Anyone who does
in this house is a fool.

651

01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:57,634
What a pity
Miss Tanner died

930
01:17:57,702 --> 01:18:00,637
when the answer
was so close.

931
01:18:00,705 --> 01:18:02,468
Barrett.

932
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,100
Barrett,
the house is clear.

933
01:18:05,176 --> 01:18:07,110
It is completely clear!

934
01:18:07,178 --> 01:18:12,115
And I called that machine
a pile ofjunk.

935
01:18:15,186 --> 01:18:18,622
You better go
and get some rest.

936
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:21,624
I want to check
my readings.

[Clacking]

941
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:12,175
This is impossible.

942
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:18,309
I don't accept this.

943
01:19:18,382 --> 01:19:21,442
I do not accept this!

944
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,123
Lionel?

945
01:19:29,693 --> 01:19:31,126
Lionel.

946
01:19:54,718 --> 01:19:56,083
Lionel!

947
01:19:56,153 --> 01:19:58,178
In here.

948
01:20:08,732 --> 01:20:10,165
Lionel?

949
01:20:10,234 --> 01:20:11,667
Here.

950
01:20:45,636 --> 01:20:46,728
Aah!

951
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:49,034
Aah!

952
01:20:49,106 --> 01:20:51,870
Aah!

953
01:20:51,942 --> 01:20:54,001
Aah!

954
01:20:56,714 --> 01:20:58,204
Aah!

Aah!

01:21:04,221 --> 01:21:06,155
Aah!

01:21:06,223 --> 01:21:07,656
No!

958
01:21:07,725 --> 01:21:09,158
No!

959
01:21:21,672 --> 01:21:23,105
I'm sorry.

960
01:21:33,684 --> 01:21:35,117
Lionel.

961
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:42,626
Oh, please get me
out ofhere.

962
01:21:42,693 --> 01:21:44,126
Please.

963
01:21:44,195 --> 01:21:46,129
I'm not leaving.

964
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:49,132
I'm going back
to the chapel.

965
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,134
No. No, you can't.

966
01:21:51,202 --> 01:21:55,138
You don't know
what it's like in there.

967
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:57,140
I have to.

968
01:21:58,709 --> 01:22:01,644
You don't.

969
01:22:01,712 --> 01:22:05,478
There is no reason
to go back there.

970
01:22:05,549 --> 01:22:06,641
None.

971
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:10,551
Ann, listen.

972
01:22:11,722 --> 01:22:13,656
I have to.

973
01:22:13,724 --> 01:22:15,658
It's for Florence.

974
01:22:15,726 --> 01:22:17,591
It's foryour husband.

975
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:20,596
IfI leave
Hell House now,

976
01:22:20,664 --> 01:22:24,065
mywhole life
will be a failure.

977
01:22:24,134 --> 01:22:26,602
You can't solve it.

978
01:22:28,672 --> 01:22:31,607
It cannot be solved.

979
01:22:33,177 --> 01:22:37,614
You're going to die...

980
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:40,115
like Lionel,

981
01:22:40,184 --> 01:22:42,744
like Miss Tanner.

982
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:48,123
Then I will.

983
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:00,599
It's here.

984
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,104
The entire house is clear

985
01:23:05,172 --> 01:23:07,606
except for
this one place.

986
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:11,110
Why?

987
01:23:15,683 --> 01:23:17,116
Why?

988
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:25,554
Why?

989
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,076
Belasco.

990
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:51,585
That's what the '' B''
inside the circle means.

991
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:59,593
She was trying
to tell us

992
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:03,596
that it was only
Belasco all along.

993
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:15,609
It isn't mindless,
directionless power.

994
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:20,947
It isn't
multiple hauntings.

995
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:23,040
It's only one.

996
01:24:23,117 --> 01:24:26,280
One entity pretending
to be Daniel.

997
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,789
One entity pretending
to be many others.

998
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,291
That's where
the answer lies.

999
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:40,299
But what's the key?

1000
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,528
What is the key?

1001
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,821
Extremes andlimits.

1002
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:05,325
Terminations andextremities.

1003
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:06,484
Oh.

1004
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,329
Oh, God.

1005
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,334
Ofcourse.
That's what she meant.

1006
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:20,271
Extremes.

1007
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:22,275

1008
01:25:25,346 --> 01:25:27,280

and legs shattered.

Tell me something,

Why didn'tyou ever
leave this house

1030
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:26,265
when you were alive?

1031
01:27:27,835 --> 01:27:31,771
Why did you despise
the sunlight?

1032
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:38,278
Was it better hiding
in the shadows?

01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:23,315
Emeric Belasco.

1056
01:29:38,899 --> 01:29:40,992
Is it clear?

1057
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:43,927
This is a special moment.

1058
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:48,161
Meet Emeric Belasco.

1059
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:51,864
Your husband did have
part ofthe answer.

1060
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:55,875
Florence had
part ofit, too.

1061
01:30:55,943 --> 01:30:59,379
I fi nally found
the last part,

1062
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:02,381
that which
Belasco's giant ego

1063
01:31:02,449 --> 01:31:04,679
could not face.

1064
01:31:16,463 --> 01:31:19,330
He so despised
his own shortness

1065
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:22,334
that he cut off his legs

1066
01:31:22,402 --> 01:31:26,338
and wore those instead
to give himselfheight.

1067
01:31:26,406 --> 01:31:30,342
''Ifthine eye offend thee,
pluck it out.''

1068
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:42,855
Maybe he was a genius
after all.

1069
01:31:42,923 --> 01:31:46,359
Just because a man
preserves his body

1070
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,860
doesn't make him
a genius.

1071
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:53,366
It's not his body
ofwhich I'm speaking.

1072
01:31:53,433 --> 01:31:56,368
This is why
your husband's machine

1073
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:59,371
could not destroy
his power.

1074
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:05,378
These walls
are sheathed with lead.

1075
01:32:05,445 --> 01:32:08,380
He built himself
a fortress

1076
01:32:08,448 --> 01:32:11,383
to protect his spirit.

1077
01:32:11,451 --> 01:32:15,888
He knew what was coming
years before it came.

1078
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,834
Your husband
and Florence

1079
01:32:28,902 --> 01:32:31,837
helped us
to rid this house

1080
01:32:31,905 --> 01:32:33,338
of Belasco.

1081
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:36,342
Let us hope
that their spirits

1082
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:39,846
guide him
to everlasting peace.

1083
01:32:45,919 --> 01:32:49,704
