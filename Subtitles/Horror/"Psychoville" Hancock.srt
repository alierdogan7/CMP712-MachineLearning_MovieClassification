1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,239
Still got a few tricks
up your sleeve, Jolly.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,440
We're missing a book.

3
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,079
50 Great Coastal Walks
Of The British Isles Volume Two.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,839
Police have been asking -
I need someone to look after it.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,679
Stop it! Oh, why should I?

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,559
Because you've got cancer!

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,720
No loose ends, Kelvin.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,479
And if he doesn't know anything?
Kill him.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,279
What do you know about Hancock?

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,359
Who is he? Fill me in.
His name's Shahrouz. Oh, my God!

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,760
Will you marry him for me?

12
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,839
I won't say anything.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,039
Billy was nine years old,
fell out of a tree.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,999
Lost a lot of blood.
My wife said we'd better call Tony.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,719
What? He was the father?

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,240
I loved that boy
but I walked out on him that day
and never seen him since.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,120
How long have I got?

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,359
I'm just reading the file on
Oscar Lomax. Have you read it?
Oh, yes, ma'am.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,839
I can't believe it.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,119
Indeed, ma'am. It's quite
extraordinary, if it's true.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,279
What's the clown up to? Mr Jelly?

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,439
Still visiting the old lady,
the occasional children's party.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,159
Nothing out of the ordinary.

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
It's my video conference call.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,519
Mr Mansour. Can you see me?

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,159
Yes, I see you.
Now, am I in high definition?

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,160
We had these HDMI cables fitted.
You should be able to tell
if I hold up this.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,079
Never mind.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,999
We are growing impatient,
Miss Andrews.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,399
When will we see
a return on our investment?

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,639
I can assure you we are very close to
making our presentation, Mr Mansour.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,759
I'm sure you can appreciate
we're working at the cutting-edge
of technology here.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,120
Sorry ma'am, just need to grab
a bit of Blu-Tack. Thanks.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,199
We are just waiting on the
final piece of the jigsaw
before we can proceed.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,639
I hope I need not remind you how
much is at stake here, Miss Andrews?

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,239
Of course. And I can assure you
that we will leave no stone unturned.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
No offence.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,799
What do you mean?

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Well, you stone people, don't you?

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,919
Do you?

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,840
I hope to hear from you soon.

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,720
Shit.
Think I put my foot in it, there.

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,000
Kelvin, get Detective Finney.
I need that locket!

45
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,199
Hi, Mum.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,879
Morning, David.

I've mushed a Weetabick up for you,
it's on the table.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,719
How you feeling?

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,639
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Here, take your vitamins.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,360
It burns.
That's because it's working.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,639
Sorry about last night.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,319
Robin's fault. I've spent ages
unblocking that toilet bowl.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,879
You should've seen me.
It was like Augustus Gloop.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,280
No, I mean the cancer.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,680
What are you going to do?

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,879
I'm clearing out under your bed

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,839

want me to see, shift it.

I think it would be wise if we met.
Meet me at King's Cross Station.

Be back in ten minutes, all right?

Aye, go on then. Cod and chips.

Oh, you mean like a flour shaker?

No, we do toys, dear. Antiques.

Where is it, then?

Here, I've laid it all out for you.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,719
Not much new stuff in this month.
Come and have a feel.

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,799
That Sooty turned out
to be fake, then?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,559
Yes, they traced it back to a woman
in Pickering. She made them herself.

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,999
Apparently, she had a whole
attic full of Sues.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,039
She was about to flood the market
but they caught her.

83

This Slinky's a bit loose, isn't it?
I know, it's Chinese.

Would you have any interest
in a Simpsons chess set?

Not in the slightest.
I cannot shift it.

Oh, stay away from the '80s, Peter.
You've been burned before.

What's this?
Not seen one like this before.

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,719
Oh, it just came in this morning,

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,479
not had a chance to give it
the once-over myself yet.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,079
Papier mache head, wooden hands,
nicely carved.

Original lace.

French, I'd say.
This is quite a find, Peter.

processing your visa application.

Visa, yes.

111

Well, he's suspicious about
our wedding cos it was so close
to the expiry date of your old visa,

living as Mr and Mrs,

is it a boy or a girl?

A young man I believe, sir.
He's just upstairs getting prepared.

Why not? I am Mr Jolly.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,719
No! I told you before,
I don't want anything to do with him!

146
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,119
He only wants to talk to you.
I'm not meeting him, Tealeaf.

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,679
Here, ring him up and cancel it.
Tell him it's off.

148
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,679
Look, you should just chat to him.
He seems like a nice guy.

I can't meet him, Tealeaf. Do you
understand? I can never meet him.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,959
He doesn't blame you for anything.
It wasn't your fault.

151
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,639
You were the one who was lied to.
If I saw him it would only make
things worse than they already are.

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,639
It wouldn't,
he sees you as his father.

153
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,239
I am his father. That's what he
wants. I mean I'm his real father.

Does your son know?

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes, I think he's worked it out.

161
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,960
Go and fetch him, Tealeaf.

162
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
It's time I faced the truth.

163
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,600
All right. Be back in half an hour.

You? Yes, me.

167
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,000
I know what you did.

168
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
What do you want?

169
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:53,199
Well, I've been thinking a lot about
how to commit the perfect murder.

170
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Coffee?

171
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,759
I have a bit of a problem
with cash flow.

172
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,839
I don't know if you know
about Haringey's payment structure,

173
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,039
but there's a glass ceiling
for public sector workers

174
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,920
and I'm banging my head against it.

175
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:10,079
It's supposed to incentivise
cross-borough collaboration,

176
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,799
but why would we want to get
into bed with the Barnet lot

177
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,239
when their grants
are not centrally managed?

178
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,479
I don't know. Exactly!

179
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,319
Anyway, I have, shall we say,
substantial debts,

180
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,839
and I can't keep chasing
the Thunderball forever

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,400
because that way, madness lies.

182
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,599
What's this?

183
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
I have a great aunt who's
left me some money in her will.

184
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,599
It's not much, but it'll see me
debt-free for the first time
since the credit crunch.

185
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I want you to help her on her way.

186
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,279
You want me to murder her?

187
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,119
Don't look so shocked.

188
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,999
Last time I saw you,
you were happily telling me
you'd just killed five people.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,879
Three men, two ladies.
Three men, two ladies.

190
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
This just makes it three of each.
Balances it.

191
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,759
You do this for me,
and all the information
I have on you and Critchley Gardens

192
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,720
will mysteriously find it's way
into the recycling.

193
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,799
You scratch my back and I'll
scratch yours. My mum does that.

194
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,840
Oh.

195
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,360
Well, do we have a deal?

196
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,520
She's not well.

197
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,199
If I do this for you,
you've got to do something for me.

198
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,359
Criss cross.

199
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,440
How do you mean?
I don't want her to suffer any more.

200
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,879
Is that your watch?

201
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,039
There you are. Thank you, ladies.

202
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,519
Everything's prepared for you
upstairs. If you'd come this way.

203
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,479
God, half pissed now!
Birthday boy ready, is he?

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,799
I believe so, sir.

205
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,400
Right. Well, I'd better get going.
I'll take that, thank you.

206
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,840
Everything in order, sir?

207
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,440
I think so, yes.
I won't be a moment.

208
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,360
Just checking you have everything,
Jolly? We've prepared the lights.

209
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,319
What's this?

210
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,559
This is Mr Kakkar.
And it's his left kidney, I think.
Is that right, Gravy?

211
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,599
It is, sir.

212
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,199
And the local anaesthetic
has been administered as instructed.

213
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,880
It goes in here when you're done,
then ring the bell.

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,519
I was thinking more of
a rabbit out of a hat.

215
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
We'll just leave you to it.

There's other things

Or should I try and convert you?

Yeah, he is, but we don't know when.

Margaret Cheng took it out again.

315
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,080
Because libraries are all about
sharing, aren't they, Chloe?

316
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,919
What do you want?

320
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,280
Jabberwocky would like to read
that book, Chloe.

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,959
Would you like me to send him to
your room so he can look for it?

322
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,959
Very well.

323
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,280
You have to look for it.

324
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,480

have you?

326
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, as Bonnie said,
I can always...

327
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,600
"Turn around, bright eyes".

328
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,280

my ex-partner said
he could never tell the difference.

I knew I couldn't go on.

333
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,439

Slept with his wife and
fathered a son he thought his own.

335
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,000
It killed him.

336
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,799
And the guilt killed me.

337
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,440
One fake suicide in Australia later
and all my sins were washed away.

338
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,480
The career was on its way out
so that didn't bother me.

339
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,199
I'd turned them all against me,
anyway.

340
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,319
Sid, Ray and Alan.

341
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,360
Williams.

342
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,360
All I had to do was
become somebody else.

343
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,919
It was easier to arrange
away from home.

344
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,840
A weighted coffin was buried.

345
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,360
Then I came up here
to start my new life.

346
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,280
A quiet life.

347
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,199
It's quite a story.

348
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,919
Yes, indeed.
But what about you, Billy?

349
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,399
There must me so many things
you want to ask me.

350
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,719
Oh, only one thing.
Where's the locket?

351
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,959
Eh? The locket!

352
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,359
Oscar. What happened to it?

353
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,119
What do you mean?
I don't know anything about that.

354
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,919
I thought you probably didn't.
But it'd be rude not to ask, eh?

355
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,400
Here we go, then.
Billy! Please. Billy, I'm sorry.

356
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
I forgive you.

357
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
Here we go, then.

358
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,080
You ready for this?
Just give me a moment.

359
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,840
I've waited 40 years for this.

360
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm shaking.

361
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,599
Don't worry.

362
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,279
I'm sure your dad's just as
choked up as you are.

363
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah? Come on.

364
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Mr Lomax, Billy's here.

365
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,920
Not again.

366
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,560
There you are! Where've you been?

367
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,280
Eccles.

368
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
What for?

369
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,079
Eccles cake.

370
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,599
David, how many more times?
You can get them from the Spar.

371
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,120
You don't have to go to Hamburg
to get a hamburger.

372
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,479
I've been picking out the music
I want at my funeral.

373
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,199
I want one classical and
one from the cheering-up tape.

374
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,519
Trying to decide between Superman
and Oops Upside Your Head.
See how wide the pews are.

375
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,120
But for the classical, I want this.

376
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,720
SHE PLAYS "Abide With Me"

377
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,919
'Is that you, Tealeaf?

378
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,759
'Is there anything from Nasa?

379
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
'In with the plums!'

380
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,680
'I have a great aunt.

381
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,080
'I want you to help her on her way.'
