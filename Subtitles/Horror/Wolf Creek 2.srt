01:18:39,449 --> 01:18:44,752

721
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:05,372
I hate that fucking song.

722
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,109
'Girt by sea.' Who's Gert?

723
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:10,244
- (LAUGHS)
- Some fucking big butch lesbian

724
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:13,180
standing astride Sydney
fucking Heads or something.

725
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,249
- It's a fucking shit song.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

726
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,954
Oh, shit.

727
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,095
Now, seeing as you're such

728
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:32,333
an amusing fucking Einstein
know-it-all bastard,

729
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,401
I got this little game we can play.

730
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,537
- Kinda like a quiz. Yeah.
- Right.

731
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:40,407
I call it Aussie History.

732
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:45,246
I ask you ten questions, you get
half of 'em right, so, five,

733
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:47,081
and then I'll let you go.

734
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,816
Does that sound alright to you?

735
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:54,221
That's... That sounds
fucking brilliant.

736
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:56,257
Beauty. (CHUCKLES)

737
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:58,859
Sorry. I didn't get
your name, mate.

738
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,561
Oh. Mick Taylor's the name.

739
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:04,231
Pig-shooter and general
fuckin' outback legend.

740
01:20:04,233 --> 01:20:06,167
Right. Cheers.

741
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:08,369
- You ready to rock 'n' roll?
- Yeah.

742
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,580
(CLEARS THROAT)
What's that for, Mick?

743
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:22,383
Oh, I forgot to mention.

744
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:27,988
For each one that you get wrong,
I get to grind off a finger.

745
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,423
(CHUCKLES)

746
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:34,161
- (HALF-LAUGHS)
- Ten questions, ten fingers.

747
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,030
Kind of fitting, you
know what I mean?

748
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:38,432
Of course. (CHUCKLES)

749
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,603
So it's sort of like Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire?

750
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:46,874
Except you don't get to phone
a friend if you get one wrong

751
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,543
because you'll be too busy
screaming in fucking agony!

752
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,218
Alright.

753
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,454
Let's rock 'n' roll then.

754
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:04,024
Alright. We'll start
off with an easy one.

755
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:09,230
What Aboriginal term
meaning 'waterhole'

756
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:10,631
is also the name

757
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:14,101
of an Australian surf
clothing company?

758
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,912
Billabong.

759
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:28,349
- Very good.
- (CHUCKLES)

760
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,251
- Next one's a bit harder.
- Right.

761
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:32,653
But you're a stinkin' Pom,
so you'll be alright.

762
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:38,525
In what year did the British
settle in Australia?

763
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,100
Well, um...

764
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:53,941
After Lieutenant James Cook
discovered the east coast

765
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:56,410
and mapped it in 1770,

766
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:59,079
the First Fleet arrived
and settled on

767
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:06,020
26th of January, 1788.

768
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:07,955
(CHUCKLES)

769
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:09,690
Does that answer your question?

770
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:13,494
Jesus! You are a smart cunt.

771
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:17,298
I might have to let you
go on that answer alone.

772
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,535
Where'd you learn all that shit?

773
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:26,640
Majoring in history? That's a
fucking coincidence, isn't it?

774
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,678
But I am a man of my word,

775
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,514
and either way, you
know, I did say 10...

776
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:37,117
Blah, blah, blah. Here we go.

777
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,023
OK.

778
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,731
Rightio.

779
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:54,468
In what year did the British

780
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:58,205
start deporting
convicts to Australia?

781
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,344
The first 11 ships of the First
Fleet arrived with their cargo

782
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:08,349
of around 780 British convicts
in Botany Bay, New South Wales.

783
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:14,154
And a further two convict fleets
arrived in 1790 and 1791.

784
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,225
The first free settlers
arrived in 1793.

785
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,695
Mick?

786
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,732
Mick?

787
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:26,600
That's right. Isn't it?

788
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,302
I know it is.

789
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,306
Why?

790
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:41,315
I'm not really sure I
understand the question.

791
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:47,588
Why did the British deport
convicts to Australia?

792
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,324
Why? Um...

793
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,328
Uh...

794
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:57,331
Come on, you dumb fuck!

795
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,133
Time waits for no man.

796
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:01,235
- No, no, no!
- Tick, tock, tick, tock...

797
01:24:01,237 --> 01:24:02,469
(WHIRRING)

798
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,505
First... first... first of all,

799
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:06,607
after the British lost
the 13 colonies -

800
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:09,209
they'd lost their penal
settlements in Virginia

801
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,677
in the United States.

802
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:13,280
And they needed somewhere
to put all the criminals

803
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:14,815
that were stacking up in England.

804
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:17,117
There were just too
many of these people,

805
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,687
and they were just spreading
disease and wasting resources.

806
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,790
- (WHIRRING)
- And, second of all, they...

807
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,426
Australia looked to be
as rich in resources

808
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,127
as the Americas.

809
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:29,396
And obviously the British
wanted to settle this

810
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,765
before the French
did, or the Dutch.

811
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,500
(COUGHS)

812
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:35,269
Something like that?

813
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,139
Mick, no. What the fuck, man?
That's right!

814
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:43,177
What are you doing? Mick! Fuck!
That's the right fucking answer!

815
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:44,711
What do you want me to fucking...

816
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:47,714
(SCREAMS)
Fuck! Mick, that's right!

817
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:49,183
- (GRUNTS)
- Fuck!

818
01:24:49,185 --> 01:24:51,151
That's the right
fucking answer, Mick!

819
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:54,288
Jesus Christ! No!
I got two right. Come on!

820
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,857
You don't need to fucking do this!
I got them all right.

821
01:24:56,859 --> 01:25:00,194
- (WHIRRING)
- It's the right fucking answer!

822
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:02,863
(SCREAMS)

823
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:05,199
(WHIRRING)

824
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:09,670
(WHIRRING STOPS)

825
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,576
(SCREAMS, GROANS)

826
01:25:15,578 --> 01:25:17,478
It was fucking right!

827
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,614
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was the right...

828
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,283
- No, it wasn't.
- (WHINES)

829
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:26,153
The right answer is

830
01:25:26,155 --> 01:25:31,492
because they are a
pack of Pommy cunts!

831
01:25:31,494 --> 01:25:33,360
(SCREAMS)

832
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:35,696
(CHUCKLES)

833
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:41,869
No, seriously, you're
right, technically.

834
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:45,739
And that gives me the shits.

835
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:48,876
(PAUL GROANS)

836
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,382
Come on. Calm down. Calm down.

837
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:57,918
Jesus Christ, you're going
on like a big girl.

838
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,720
It fucking hurts!

839
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:02,723
Knock those tears off.
Knock 'em off, you bloody sook.

840
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,663
- You alright?
- Yeah.

841
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:13,600
Jesus H. Christ, boy.
You alright? You alright?

842
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,402
Yeah.

843
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:18,338
Right? Alright?

844
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,541
(EXHALES)

845
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:22,943
Alright?

846
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,812
Just one more quick one.

847
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:28,815
An easy one and then I'll
get us another drink.

848
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:31,685
And you can be on your way. Eh?

849
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,488
You're doing real well, mate.
You're doing real well.

850
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:39,893
Cheers.

851
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:49,836
Now, who's Australia's
most famous cricketer?

852
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:52,906
And not Shane fucking Warne.

853
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:58,679
Come on.

854
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,722
Come on.

855
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:14,328
I don't know anything
about fucking cricket.

856
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:17,864
Can you ask me a football question?

857
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:20,000
You don't have to
know about cricket

858
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:21,735
to know who this bloke is.

859
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,604
Just give me a clue.

860
01:27:23,606 --> 01:27:26,607
Well, he's the greatest
cricketer of all time.

861
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:28,675
The Muhammad Ali of
fucking cricket!

862
01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:30,877
Oh, shit. Come on, Paul.

863
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:33,280
It's on the tip of
my fucking tongue!

864
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:35,482
This'll be on the tip of
your tongue in a minute!

865
01:27:35,484 --> 01:27:37,284
No, no, no!

866
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:39,353
What kind of a bloody
idiot you take me for?

867
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:41,588
What letter does it
fucking start with?

868
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,624
'D'. Duh!

869
01:27:43,626 --> 01:27:46,560
Doh. Duh!

870
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:49,463
- Douglas Jardine.
- Fucking Pommy, you idiot.

871
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,302
Dennis...

872
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:57,504
- Dennis Lillee.
- Not fucking Dennis Lillee.

873
01:27:57,506 --> 01:27:59,506
- It's Dennis fucking Lillee.
- It's not.

874
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:01,508
A famous cricketer
that starts with 'D'.

875
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,378
It's not fucking
Dennis fucking Lillee!

876
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,647
What the fuck is it
then if it's not...

877
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,882
Fuck this! Fuck you!

878
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:11,652
No, no, no! Please! Please!
Jesus Christ, the other hand!

879
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:12,919
MICK: Eh?

880
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,455
Use the fucking other hand, Mick!

881
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,624
Oh. Is that your
wanking hand, is it?

882
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,926
- (SOBS)
- Oh, well, please yourself.

883
01:28:19,928 --> 01:28:21,995
Mick, it's Dennis fucking Lillee!

884
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:24,865
- No, it's fucking not.
- Dennis fucking Lillee! Please!

885
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:28,001
Please! Please! Mick! Mick! Mick!

886
01:28:28,003 --> 01:28:30,804
- (MICK SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
- It's Dennis Lillee...

887
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,806
Give me that fucking hand

888
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:36,910
or I'll knock your fucking teeth
right down your fucking throat.

889
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:39,379
