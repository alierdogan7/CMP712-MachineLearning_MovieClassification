Hi.

I'm Dr. Sneiderman.

00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,735
something like this
has ever happened?

No.

361
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,493
No, the first time was different.
I was raped.

362
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,956
Where? In your home?

363
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,799
You were raped by whom?

364
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,511
I don't know.
There was no one there.

365
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,636
Okay. So in other words,

366
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,975
it wasn't a real man
that raped you?

367
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,812
He evaporated.

368
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,603
I see. But you felt him
in you, though?

369
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,021
Definitely.

370
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,198
And he felt like a man?

371
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,655

372
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,868

- Yes, of course I was in pain.

373
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,414
He was foul.

374
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,704
You mean you smelled him?

375
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,797
I see. Did he ejaculate?

376
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,885
I...

377
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,550
I think so.

378
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,437
But when my son came in,
there was nobody there.

379
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,440

380

Your son.

381
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,895

something like that happened?

No.

It started to
a second time, and...

387
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,220
he didn't get me.
We went to my friend's apartment.

388
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,056
And then this morning,

389
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,266
I was driving to work...

390
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,930
And he tried to kill you?

391
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,230
What do you think?

392
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,862
Go ahead, and be honest.
Just tell me.

what the problem is.

In the meantime, I'll be dead.

No, I don't think so.

thing by coming here.

wrong with you medically,

is that certain phases
of our life never really die.

within us, all of us.

Now I'm talking
about you, me, everybody,

501
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,939
and they affect us
the rest of our lives.

502
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,941

they come back.

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,443

504
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,148
And sometimes they come back
with a vengeance--

505
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,234
they can cause delusions,

506
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,149

507
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,443

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,952
So simple.

00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,786
Look, Carla,
what I'm going to do

510
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,497
is I'm going to give you
some tranquilizers, okay?

511
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,503
They won't knock you out,
but they will reduce your anxiety,

512
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,335
which can be as bad
as the delusion itself.

if you can believe it.

He actually spoke
with "thee" and "thou."

587
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,889
I was six before I realized
not everyone talked that way.

588
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,395
It was quite a shock.

589
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,055
Why were you afraid of him?

590
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,933
Because when he held me,

591
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,977
it wasn't the way a father
should hold a daughter.

592
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,111

So I ran away, and...

597
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,042
I got as far as New York,
and that's where I met Mario.

Must have been quite handsome.

- Billy's a good-looking kid.
- He was.

Can you tell me about him?

00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,975

That says an awful lot right there.

603
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,182
I was--
I'd never met anyone like him.

604
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,517
He was exciting.

605
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,274
What do you mean, "exciting"?
Exciting in bed?

606
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,186
Yeah. He was exciting in bed.
He was exciting in many ways.

making love with him?

- I see.

I mean, I got pregnant.
Before I knew it,

613
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,582

taking pills.

I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

- He was my husband.
- Yeah, I know that,

624
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,186
but I still don't know
how you felt.

626
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,361
I thanked God when he died.

627
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,417

for Bob Garrett.

- Julie and Kim's father.

Ah, right, right, right.

630
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,213
He was older.
He knew a lot.

631
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,630
He made me see
that life was good,

632
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:05,016
that men and women loving
each other was good, healthy,

633
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,018
having children
was good, simple.

634

635
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,936
Well, no.
We were never legally married.

636
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,147
Uh-huh. Where is he now?

637
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,311
I don't know.

638
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:20,482

to stay in one place very long.

Well, Dr. Sneiderman explained
it was like a very powerful dream.

701
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,794
Mrs. Moran...

702
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,044
did you believe him?

703
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,628
I tried to.

704
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,546
But you...

705
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,387
cannot. Hmm?

706
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,604
Why?

707
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:25,018
Because he hurt my son.
He broke his wrist.

708
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,654
Because my children feel it.

709
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,782
Because of the marks on my body.
They're in places I--

710
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,568
I can't do it to myself.
Even in a dream.

711
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,534
Why does he attack you, Carla,

712
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,790
not anyone else?

713
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,785
I don't know.

714
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,038
I suppose he chose me.

715
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,799
Chose you? Why?

716
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,718
I suppose
he finds me attractive.

on you as a woman

00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,014
or if you were cured?

720
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,944
No. It would not be
a reflection on me.

721
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,481
I hate this whole thing.
It's like a nightmare,

722
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,866
I can't wake up.
I want to get rid of him.

723
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,197

730
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:44,639
Certainly, and thank you very much,
Carla, for letting us talk to you.

731
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,728
- Sure.
- All right.

732
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,280
Quite a young lady.

733
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:56,113
- Yep.
- How did you meet her?

734
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,277
I was on call one night at
the clinic, she walked in.

735
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,037
Just came in out of the blue?

736
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,538
- Please.
- There you go.

737
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,665
- Thank you.
- A walk-in.

738
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,418
That's how it happens.

739
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,421
- Yeah.
- She's masturbating.

740
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,207
This entire circus,
she has invented it

741
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,046
to cover up what
every little girl does.

742
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,586
Well, with all due respect, sir,

743
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,721
that was my initial diagnosis,

744
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,382
but I think we can all agree

745
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,892
that that's not some teenager
with an identity crisis,

746
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,643
and now she tells us

747
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,146
that her children are feeling
this thing too, so...

748
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:30,276
It's a mass illusion,
folie a quatre.

749
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,608
Hysteria is contagious.
Given the right circumstances,

750
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,399
anyone can see and feel things
that simply aren't there.

751
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,533
Her children are just
supporting Mama's delusions.

752
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,535
Okay, classically correct,
sir, but her mind

753
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,447
is giving her very strong
and explicit images.

754
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,458
Why is she going to such lengths
to support this delusion? It--

755
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,415
Phil, look at the record.

756
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,421
She believes that her father
has incestuous desires.

757
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,175
She falls in love with an adolescent,
a typical overgrown kid.

758
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,257
He tries to prove he's
a real man, and he's not.

759
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,092
After which,
she picks up with this...

760
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,427
- Jerry Anderson?
- No, Garrett.

761
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,137
- Oh, Garrett.
- Bob Garrett, right?

to be her father.

I think I know what you're suggesting.
I don't know that I agree, though.

765
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,649
- Safe sex.
- PHIL: Well--

766
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,651
It's the story of Carla's life.

767
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,939
She's consistently refused to
get involved in the real thing.

768
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,529
- She has three children.
- What does that prove?

769
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,443
It doesn't take sex
to make babies.

770
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,157
That is a fact
I wasn't aware of.

771
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,947
- Well, now you know.
- Not real sex.

772
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,660
Now, for 32 years,

773
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,952
Carla goes along very smoothly,

774
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,336
and all of a sudden,
she meets this fellow--

775
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,247
- What's his name?
- Jerry Anderson?

776
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,460
- Now you have it.
- Ah, now I'm on it.

777
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,170
Okay. And, pow,

778
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,008
she drifts into
a Dionysian fantasy.

779
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,014
Don't you see?
It's exactly the kind of situation

780
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,516
that can energize
this sort of breakdown.

781
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,052
What, Anderson?

782
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,721
Certainly. A real man. Sure.
She wants the real thing.

783
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,731
No more faking it
with kids and old men.

784
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,985
And faced with the real thing,
Carla buckles.

785
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,396
She falls back
into an infantile reality.

786
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,407
Now, I suggest
you dig a lot deeper.

787
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,159
I think you're
going to find out more,

788
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,194
and maybe you'll find out

789
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,831
that Carla is
not what she seems to be.

01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:01,171
Get out!

869
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,176
(SOBBING)

870
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,236
Why did you tear up your room?
Why did you yell at Billy?

871
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,068
- Because I had an orgasm.
- What?

872
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,403
I had an orgasm.

873
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,944
An orgasm?

874
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,613
Yeah. But he tricked me.
I was asleep.

875
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,908
I was asleep,
and I was dreaming.

876
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,370
And I'm ashamed.

877
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,297
I'm ashamed.

878
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,801
Mm-hmm.
Carla, I want you

879
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,178
to sign yourself
into the hospital.

880
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:45,719
No. I won't let myself
be committed.

881
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,759
No, you're not being committed.
It's just going to be

882
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,223
for a two-week observation period.
That's all.

883
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,059
It amounts to the same thing.
You know it.

884
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,440
Carla, do you know
that if we wanted to,

885
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:54,941
we can insist
that you stay here.

886
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,443
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, we can.

887
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,979
Yes, we can,
for trying to commit suicide.

888
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,364
- What are you talking about, suicide?
- You know what I'm talking about.

889
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:03,241
What do you think you were doing
when you crashed your car?

890
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,869
- He was trying to murder me!
- It was a suicide attempt, Carla.

891
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,075
We could have you in here
before the day is out.

892
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,661
No, you can't.
There were no witnesses.

893
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,417
I won't say a thing.
It's my decision.

894
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,998
- What, to stay sick?
- To stay alive.

895
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,210
No matter what you think,
he's stronger than you are.

896
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,750
He'll kill me if he has to.

897
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,384
Why, to keep you
from getting better, right?

898
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,669
However you want
to call it, yes.

899
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,429
Yes, that's what I want
to call it. Exactly.

900
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,884
How about Jerry?
What are you going to do with him?

901
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,515
How are you going
to deal with him?

902
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,802
How would I deal with him
from a padded cell?

903
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,470
What about your kids, Carla?

904
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,847
Carla, listen to me.

905
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,481
You're running the risk
of harming your children.

906
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,892
No. They won't be harmed.

907
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,435
Billy has already
broken his wrist.

908
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,944
Beyond that, you're harming them
psychologically.

909
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,355
There's nothing wrong
with my children.

910
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,944
Carla, that's not the environment
they need. You know that.

911
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,576
Look, I know you think I'm crazy.
it doesn't matter about your theories.

912
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,328
Whether it's me or something
else is beside the point now.

913
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,740
What are you telling me? You're going to
stay home and be victimized?

914
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:52,998
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

915
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,832
I'll stay at home. I'll see you.
I'll go to secretarial school.

916
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,667
When I graduate,
I'll look for a better job.

917
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,082
But the one thing I won't do
is to go into any hospital.

918
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,591
Mm-hmm, and you'll
be beaten and frightened.

919
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,877
- No. No.
- No? No? Why not?

920
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,761
'Cause I'm going
to cooperate with him.

921
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,484
Carla, you're
a very intelligent woman.

922
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,148
I know you'll always
listen to reason,

923
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,283
so now I want to talk to you
reasonably, okay?

924
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:30,036
No more questions
and answers, hmm?

925
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:33,540
You know, there was a time when people
believed in the supernatural.

926
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,917
Here. I want you
to look at these pictures.

927
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,870
Pretty frightening, huh?

928
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,462
Bats, werewolves,
dragons, demons,

929
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,093
all sorts of goblins, okay?

930
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,095
They were supposed
to abuse people sexually.

931
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,973
They were supposed
to impregnate people.

932
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,226
Do you think these things
really exist in there?

933
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,762
- I am not stupid.
- I didn't say you were stupid.

934
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,977
But why do you think these
people saw these things, huh?

935
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,517
Why do you think
they saw them?

936
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,106
Hmm? Can you take a guess?
Do you know why?

937
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,022
Because it was a way of expressing
something that was frightening to them.

938
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,237
- It has nothing to do with me.
- Wait a second. Carla...

939
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,992
- it has a lot to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me.

940
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,619
Oh, no, it has a lot
to do with you.

941
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,280
It has an awful lot
to do with you.

942
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,290
These ghosts and demons
were only ideas,

943
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,451
but people saw them.

944
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,257
Look, Carla, let's say
a man who wanted to be good

945
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,259
had a desire
for his neighbor's wife.

946
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,092
He knows it's wrong,
he feels terrible about it,

947
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,508
but the desire
is growing and growing.

948
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,302
Desire can be a very frightening
and powerful sensation.

949
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,597
How does he deal with it?
He invents a creature,

950
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:41,562
an evil, ugly,
evil-tempered creature

951
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,568
which is just a picture
of his own desire, Carla.

952
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,445
I have no need of inventing
anything, Dr. Sneiderman.

953
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,073
Come on, Carla, stop it.
You have a lot of need.

954
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,484
You were scared
of your daddy.

955
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,822
He was a minister.
He held you in a way

956
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,237
- he shouldn't have held you.
- Stop it.

957
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,871
- You were pregnant at 16.
- Oh, shut up!

958
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,497
A drug-crazed guy
went off and killed himself.

959
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,748
- Stop it!
- Another guy left you

960
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,409
with two kids.
Now, Carla, stop it!

961
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:03,171
Come on. Do the work, Carla.
What was evil to your family?

962
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,832
All sorts of things were evil
to my family. You know that.

963
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,592
Carla, we know your family well enough
to know what was evil to them.

964
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,172
As a child, you knew
what was evil to him. What?

965
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,838
- Sex. They were afraid of sex.
- Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.

966
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,552
They were afraid of sex.
Exactly.

967
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,264
So let's use our imagination
a little bit, okay?

968
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,769
Let's try putting
some things together.

969
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,395
Like a dream,
it's getting all mixed up.

970
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,897
Your creature is
a symbol, Carla.

971
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,398
A symbol of what?

972
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,104
I don't know yet.
Maybe we'll find out.

973
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,111
Could be a specific person,
a fear of someone, a desire...

974
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,773
No, I'm not hiding
from anybody or anything!

975
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,034
Carla. Carla, let's talk
about your visitor friend, okay?

976
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,866
- Dr. Sneiderman, I'm so sick of this.
- Take a good look at him.

977
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,576
What do we know
about him, Carla?

978
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,207
Come on. Let's use your words.
What do we know about him?

979
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,959
We know that he is big,
we know that he is strong.

980
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,041
It's frightening how strong
this guy is, isn't it?

981
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,955
You told me,
unbelievably strong.

982
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,466
So why does he need help?
But he has two helpers, right?

983
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,969
Two little ones? Right?
Those are your words.

984
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,629
One big one
and two little ones.

985
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,138
- Oh, you're obscene.
- Billy's a good-looking kid.

986
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:55,549
What you're suggesting
is obscene.

987
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:56,887
- He's a strong kid.
- You're obscene!

988
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,472
You're having
trouble with Jerry, and--

989
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,978
- You're obscene.
- Carla, calm-- Carla!

990
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,138
- I'll calm down, but not here!
- Carla!

991
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,898
Shit.

992
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:13,571
He was talking about
two little ones and a big one.

993
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,577
He was implying that I wanted
to make love with Billy.

(SIRENS PASSING)

995
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,957
It was just obscene, you know?

996
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,459
- Really.
- It was obscene.

997
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:24,961
There's no other word for it.

998
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,338
No. I think
he just pushed too far.

999
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,465
He pushed too far. It was disgusting.
It was sickening.

1000
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,672
I mean, I know he has to probe
into painful areas

1001
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,131
- and everything, but...
- That's not probing.

1002

I'm not going back.
I'm never going back.

1003
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,389
Oh, no. Wait a minute.
Maybe you're overreacting

1004
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,015
- a little bit, Carla.
- I'm never going back.

1005
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,300
- Honey?
- What?

1006
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,265
- You ready to go?
- Yes, I am, George.

1007
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,270
Just give me a minute, please.

1008
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,103
Well, I'm going to get the car,
'cause I don't want to be late.

1009

Okay, honey.
No, we're not going to be late.

to cause any trouble...

- No.
- between you and George.

1012
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,279
I shouldn't have barged in.
I should have called.

No, no, no. We just have

1014
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,661
- to make an appearance...
- I just wanted to talk.

It's important to George, you know?

1016

Well, I'm going
to see you tomorrow.

No, I want you to stay here.

- Yeah.
- Please. You look so tired.

1031
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,832
How's everything? Okay?

1032
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,924
Dr. Sneiderman?
You didn't tell him where I was?

1033
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,088
I don't want to talk to him.

1034
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,099
Good.
Look, you have the number here.

1035
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,260
If there's any problem,
call me, okay?

1036
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,771
I'll be home
in a couple of hours.

1037
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,431

She couldn't
have done all this.

and went crazy,

1086

and everything was shaking.

1087
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,931

and the walls were shaking.

1089
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:17,980
No, it wasn't
like an earthquake.

1090
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,516
It was much stronger
than any earthquake.

1091
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,150
And I tried to get out of here,

1092
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,776
and I wanted
to get the kids out,

1093
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,608
and I called Bill.
Bill was in his room.

1094
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,818
And then the door slammed.
It was just a horrible thing.

1095
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,029
- Where is Billy now?
- He's out in the garage.

1096
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,365
- You can talk to him if--
- Door slam like that?

1097
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,372

This is where--

1100
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,204
well, you know
about that attack. And I--

1101
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,044
this was the door. It was stuck,
and I couldn't get out of it,

1102
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,425
and I tried, and I just
couldn't get out of it.

1103
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,424
It was stuck that night.

This is the girls' room.

1106
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,391
They're asleep right now,
and I don't want to disturb them.

1107
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,931
Did they sleep
through this whole attack?

1108
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,940
Yeah, they managed
to sleep through it.

1109
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,443
- Sound sleepers.
- They are.

This is where Billy
got the lightning.

1113
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:14,199
It was like it was lightning
going into him,

1114
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,829
and he fell down.
He broke his wrist--

1115
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,240
By lightning, you mean
an electrical discharge?

1116
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,749
I don't know what it was.

1117
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,376
It was like lightning
was going into him

1118
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,207
- and I was on the couch.
- Like an arc?

I'd like to know
what the diagnosis was.

1203
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,843
Well, that's no problem.
She was seeing someone right here.

1204
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,308
MAN: I got it.

1205
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,357
Get that blue one.

1206
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,941
JOE: Yeah, well, we're doing
the best that we can.

1207
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,576
Oh, we got a lot
of people here,

1208
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,782
lot of folks, yeah.

1209
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:49,288
Well, we're wiring
the place up

1210
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,494
for any kind of movement
that we might get

1211
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,534
and putting
x-ray plates up also.

1212
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,624
No, we're hanging up
wires and stuff.

1213
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,960
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Carla Moran.

1214
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,091
Are you here
to observe the phenomena?

1215
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,797
Observe the phenomena?

1216
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,463
No, I'm Phil Sneiderman.
I'm a resident in psychiatry.

1217
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,472
Carla's my patient.

1218
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,349
Oh, hi. I'm Gene Kraft,
Department of Psychology.

1219
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:10,851
How do you do?
Nice to meet--

1220
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,727
what branch of psych you in?
Clinical? Dr. Morris?

1221
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:14,934
No. Parapsychology.
Dr. Cooley.

1222
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,440
- Gene.
- Oh, Parapsychology.

1223
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,692
Gene, hand me a roll of tape,
would you, please?

1224
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,023
Yeah.

1225
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,858
What are you guys
doing with all this stuff?

1226
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,272
We're trying to gather
some hard data

1227
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,782
on the phenomena
that's occurring here.

1228
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,988
Oh, really?
I take it you've already

1229
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,619
looked under the beds
and in the closets.

1230
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,621
(LAUGHS) Yeah. We're leaving
no stone unturned,

1231
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,123
- but thanks for the tip.
- Sure.

1232
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,159
As a matter of fact,
we got some highly interesting

1233
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,668
- electrical formations...
- Did you?

1234
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,170
Possibly caused
by the entity itself.

1235
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,750
The entity?
The entity?

1236
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:42,166
You know, I hope you guys
will excuse me for saying so,

1237
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:44,380
but if you guys want
to go on TV talk shows,

1238
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:46,511
bend spoons, entertain people,
I'm all for that,

1239
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,843
but this lady is under my care, and
what you're doing isn't helping her.

1240
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,930
Well, thank you very much for
your professional opinion, Dr...

1241
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,435
Sneiderman.

1242
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,096
- Sneiderman.
- Uh-huh.

1243
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,395
- Where's Carla?
- She's in the back.

1244
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,030
CARLA: ...think it is.
I don't think so,

1245
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,657
'cause you haven't
been here during it.

1246
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,408
Just to line it up, huh?

1247
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,740
- Yeah.
- Carla?

1248
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,371
(TAPS FINGERS)

1249
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,203

1250
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:16,867
- Hi.
- Hi.

1251
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,997
Boy, you got a lot of company.

1252
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,006
You missed
your appointment yesterday.

1253
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,542
I was worried about you.

1254
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,052
That's very sweet of you.

1255
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,009
You look terrific.

1256
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,094
I've never felt better,
Dr. Sneiderman.

1257
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,883
- Really?
- Mmmmm.

1258
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,929
Look, is there someplace
that we could go and talk?

1259
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,189
Yeah.

1260
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,309
I can't blame you
for not coming back.

1261
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,149
I really did push
a little too hard.

1262
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,313
I think you need
to understand something.

1263
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,403
I feel very fine now.

1264
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,442
There are no more attacks.
I have no reason to see you.

1265
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,450
Carla, do you remember
that book I showed you

1266
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,489
in the office?
The bats and the dragons?

1267
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,205
That's what those guys
are looking for, fantasies.

1268
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,789
No, they have photographs.

1269
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,454
Okay.

1270
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:05,465
Look, Carla,
how about you and me,

1271
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,127
we make a bargain, okay?

1272
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,137
You can see me and still...

1273
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,970
have your scientist friends
help you.

1274
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,725
I don't see any point in that.

1275
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,386
Well, it's like seeing
two different doctors,

1276
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,396
you know,
getting different opinions,

1277
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,102
a bone specialist
and a blood specialist.

1278
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,063
- They work together.
- No, I'd rather not.

1279
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,647
Why?
What have we got to lose?

1280
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,897
I believed in you.

1281
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,565
You know I did.

1282
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,860
I really needed to believe in you.
But every time you discovered

1283
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,074
something new about me,
something worse happened,

1284
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:37,740
and I got sick of hearing
that it would all go away

1285
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,204
as soon as we got down to the basic
problem, as though it was in me.

1286
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,369
It is in you, Carla.

1287
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,211
I think you better leave.

1288
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,466
- Hi, Billy.
- Hi.

1289
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:58,181
- Billy. Billy!
- Yeah?

1290
01:24:58,343 --> 01:24:59,811
- Look, would you do me a favor?
- What?

1291
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,597
Don't pretend next time.

1292
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,857
The next time your mother
thinks she sees something

1293
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,814
or she hears something,
she wants you to corroborate it,

1294
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,603
and when you do, it's that much
more difficult to convince her

1295
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,442
that it's all in her head,
it's a delusion.

1296
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,073
I didn't get a broken arm
by pretending.

1297
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,699
Look, Billy, there's a lot
of logical explanations

1298
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,360
that could have caused
something like this.

1299
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,779
All I'm telling you, that is,
if you care about your mom,

1300
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,367
you will not pretend next time.

1301
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,578
I care about my mother, yeah.
But I was not pretending.

1302
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,243
I'm not lying to you.

1303
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,928
Want to know
why she's not coming back?

1304
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,759
- Mmmmm.
- She's fallen in with some schmucks

1305
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,265
who are supporting her fantasies.
You ought to see her house.

1306
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,143
They're watching her visitations,
got it all wired to look for poltergei--

1307
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,474
- Entities.
- Wait a minute.

1308
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,889
That's what they called it,
an entity.

1309
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:44,272
- What schmucks?
- I don't know.

1310
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:45,774

from the university here.

- Elizabeth Cooley.
- Yeah.

1316
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,527
It's fly-by-night psychology.

01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,491
Okay. So how do we
get rid of 'em?

1318
01:25:58,654 --> 01:25:59,997
Well, not very easily.

1319
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,328
I mean, these are
not snake-oil peddlers, Phil.

1320

They're feeding her delusion.

they get through with her,

1324
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,792
she's really going to be
off her rocker or worse.

you can do,

not legally or medically.

1327
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,634
It's her life, her house,
her delusions.

1328
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,644

the line of legal sanity,

and that this was
a mass hallucination?

1370
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,438
I've always believed

1371
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,441
that there were several planes
of existence,

1372
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,944
distinct and separate...

1373
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,824
and we, as human beings,
inhabit only one.

1374
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:51,580
Isn't it possible that some sort
of external intelligence,

1375
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,036
some discarnate entity,

1376
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,622
has crossed into
our plane of existence?

1377
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,503
How are we going to prove it?

1378
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,256
We have to isolate it.

1379
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,633
We have to draw it in somehow,

1380
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,466
find a way to bring it into
a controlled situation.

1381
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:06,753
MAN:
Yeah, me too.

1382
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,755
MAN:
Yeah, me too.

1383
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,299
- Put it in.
- Okay, we got it.

1384
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,433
(SCREEN DOOR CLOSES)

1385
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:14,769
Good night, Mrs. Moran.

1386
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:16,430
- Good night, Mrs. Moran.
- Thank you.

1387
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,274
We've got some real good ideas
on how to proceed.

1388
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:21,935
Thanks a lot.

1389
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:27,153
- You've got the tape, right?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1390
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:33,325
- Jerry.
- Hi, cutie.

1391
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,786
Excuse me.

1392
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:37,667
(LAUGHS)

1393
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,834
- What gives?
- Why didn't you call?

1394
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,671
I did. Every time, I got
a different voice on the line.

1395
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:47,006
What's going on?

1396
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,671
Those people
are from the university.

1397
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,340
The university?

1398
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:55,765
I missed you.
Look at me. I'm shaking.

1399
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:58,396
I think we'd better
have a drink.

1400
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:00,273
Got some good wine.

1401
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:04,562
Um, yeah, well, you go ahead.
I don't think I'd really better.

1402
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:06,321
No, no,
you're going to have one.

1403
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:08,231
This is my homecoming.
Come on.

1404
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:11,860
What was that all about?

1405
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,614
They're trying to help.

1406
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,160
- Help who?
- Me.

1407
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,828
I don't know what you mean.

1408
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,383
I've been sick, Jerry.

1409
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,341
Sick? What kind of sick?

1410
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,347
Things have come to me...

1411
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,099
in the night.

1412
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,395
- Nightmares, you mean?
- Yeah.

1413
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,648
Like nightmares. Exactly.

1414
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:45,276
I mean, those people
you saw in the house,

1415
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:47,437
they're psychologists.
They're doctors,

1416
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:50,448
and they have a theory
that there's something

1417
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:53,451
in the house that...

1418
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,328
is keeping me from sleeping,

1419
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,457
and they're trying to fix it.

1420
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,619
Some of them looked pretty young
to be doctors.

1421
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:06,669
- Oh, you're mad.
- No, it's not a question of mad.

1422
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,674
- Yeah, okay, since you ask.
- Yeah, you're mad.

1423
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,427
I mean, who brings
a university full of kids

1424
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,929
into their house
because they can't sleep?

1425
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,967
You can't sleep, you take a pill.
You go see a regular doctor.

1426
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,055
I'm not giving a party, Jerry.
I'm really not.

1427
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:20,141
Hey, all I'm asking for
is a simple explanation.

1428
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:21,600
I still don't know
what's bugging you.

1429
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,106
- Yeah.
- Don't treat me like a jerk.

1430
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,732
- I'm not a jerk, okay, Carly?
- I'm sorry.

1431
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:27,269
Trust me. Just tell me
what the hell's happening.

1432
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:31,781
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know--

1433
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,784
I don't know the difference

1434
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,741
between what is happening

1435
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:39,531
and what I think
might be happening.

1436
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,826
The only thing I know for certain
is that it started when you left.

1437
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,086
And I don't say that
with any kind of blame

1438
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:47,293
or accusation,
but that is when it started.

1439
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:49,958
When what started, Carly?
What?

1440
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,129
All right.

1441
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,266
Okay. I was--

1442
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:00,847
I was attacked.
And it's not happening now,

1443
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,307
so don't worry,
but I was attacked.

1444
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,938
You were attacked?
By who? Who attacked you?

1445
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,223
- Nobody. Nobody.
- You were attacked?

1446
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,391
No, nobody. Nobody.

1447
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,361
Nobody you can see.

1448
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,897
Oh, God.
This sounds so crazy.

1449
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,862
I mean, it was like
a horrible dream.

1450
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,617
Shit. I don't know
how to explain it.

1451
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:19,245
It sounds crazy
every time I explain it.

1452
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,498
- Ohh.
- It sounds crazy.

1453
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,329
God, baby.

1454
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:27,294
Oh, Carla.

1455
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,547
Do you know, for a second,
you had me worried?

1456
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,504
I mean, I thought
you were really attacked.

1457
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,009
I thought that somebody
attacked you.

1458
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:35,170
(LAUGHING)

1459
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:39,641
JERRY: Honey.

1460
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,097
I know why you can't sleep,

1461
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,638
but I am with you right now.

1462
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:48,896
I will guarantee you
that these dreams

1463
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,605
or nightmares
or whatever the hell they are

1464
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,566
will never bother you again.

1465
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,609
Because I'm staying this time.
No more trips.

1466
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,619
No more one-night stands, baby.

1467
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:03,782
Starting tonight,
it's going to be forever.

1468
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:16,044
Hey.

1469
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:18,464
Let's go to bed.

1470
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,257
Huh?

1471
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:22,175
Hey, can we go to your place?

1472
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:25,562
Uh-uh.
Remember, I'm with you,

1473
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,688
and as long as I am,

1474
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,770
nothing bad is going to happen.

1475
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:31,731
Do you believe that?

1476
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,072
I got something for you.

1477
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,322
What? What is this?

1478
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,987
You'll see.

1479
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,501
Oh.

1480
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,833
Aw, it's beautiful.

1481
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,542
- Mmm.
- It's pure silk.

1482
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,548
It feels good.

1483
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,215
Go put it on for me.

1484
01:35:58,378 --> 01:35:59,971
Come on.
It's my homecoming.

1485
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:01,631
Put it on.

1486
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,363
(HUMMING)

1487
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:45,593
Look, honey. You know what
I was thinking? If we--

1488
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,635
Please. Help me.

1489
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,600
Help me.

1490
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,724
Help me. Help me.

1491
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,483
Help me.

Help me. Help me.

1493
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,074
Help me.

1494
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:05,366
Help me. Help me.

1495
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,953
Please, help me.

1496
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,960
Help me.

1497
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,871
Help me. Help me!

1498
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,585
Help me.

1499
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:19,547

Help me. Help me.

1502
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,231
Help me.

1503
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:36,063
Stop it. Stop it.

1504

- Get off her.
- Help me.

- Help me.
- Stop it!

1506
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,940
Stop it!

You son of a bitch!

You fucking bastard!
You son of a bitch!

1509
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:54,335
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Dr. Bronstein, Dr. Loomis...

1510
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:55,791
Okay. She's going
to be all right.

1511
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,455
- Yeah?
- She's still a little shaky,

1512
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,499
so when you go in,
don't stay too long, okay?

1513
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:01,212
- All right.
- Okay. All right. Go in.

1514
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:02,923
Go in.
She's dying to see you.

1515
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,429
Make a right
at the corner there.

1516
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:05,930
- BILL: First right?
- First door on your right.

1517
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:07,386
- Thanks a lot.
- You got it.

1518
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,050
Don't stay too long.
Please don't.

1519
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,767
Okay, Jerry,
she's going to be okay.

1520
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,682
It was just
a slight concussion.

1521
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,394
Thank God for that, Doctor.

1522
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,937
Thank God.

1523
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,777
Look, why don't you
go in and see her?

1524
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:24,816
She'd like to see you.

1525
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:27,155
No way, Doctor.

1526
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:29,412
I can't be around her.

1527
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,038
I can't handle
what's going on in there.

1528
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,449
Come on, Jerry.
What do you mean

1529
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,083
you can't handle it?
She needs you now.

1530
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:36,085
I mean, I loved her.

1531
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,714
I was going to marry her,
you know.

1532
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:44,002
I could've taken anything,
I mean, a disease, cancer.

1533
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,421
This is a disease, Jerry.
It's the same thing.

1534
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:47,839
Not what she's
got living with her.

1535
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:50,133
Jerry, it's just
a disease now, okay?

1536
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,721
Now just get it
through your head.

1537
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,557
It's just in her head.
There was nobody there.

1538
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:55,016
Nobody was there.

1539
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,647
Don't tell me that.
There was somebody there.

1540
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,058
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean, there was.

1541
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,771
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

1542
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:02,357
I couldn't see him with my eyes,
but there was somebody there.

1543
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,239
I see this--

1544
01:39:05,398 --> 01:39:07,275
like something is pressing her.

1545
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:08,910
It's pushing her.

1546
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:12,072
I see her breasts
are being touched.

1547
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:16,292
I mean, I see her breasts
are being squeezed by fingers,

1548
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,294
only I can't see the fingers.

1549
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,539
I'm sorry.

1550
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,424
That's okay. That's okay.

1551
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,008
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

1552
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,673
We're visiting a friend.

1553
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:35,728
- I got to go now.
- No, no. Oh, Jerry, look.

1554
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,764
She needs you now.
She needs you now a lot.

1555
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,603
It's okay. It's okay.
I really have to go.

1556
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,267
Hey, Jerry--

1557
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:45,280
- NURSE: Look at me.
- GENE: Thanks for calling, Billy.

1558
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,941
- Come on.
- No. I want to stay with Mommy.

1559
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:50,075
Come on.
We've got to go.

1560
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,612
- I'll talk to you later, Mom.
- Okay.

1561
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,701
I hope you're all right,
Mrs. Moran.

1562
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:56,958
NURSE:
I'll be back.

1563
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,289
We never should've left
the house. I'm sorry.

1564
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,127
Maybe this doesn't seem
like the best time for this,

1565
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,041
but we're afraid for you.

1566
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:09,633
JOE: We have an idea
that might help.

1567
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,390
We want to try to isolate
this thing and immobilize it.

1568
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,847
COOLEY:
We need your consent.

1569
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,980
That means going into it
with your eyes wide open.

1570
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:22,984
What we have in mind
has never been tried before.

1571
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:26,396
We'll take
every possible precaution.

1572
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:33,494
I'll do anything...

1573
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:35,781
to get rid of him.

1574
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:40,835
That guy Jerry was
her only contact with reality.

1575
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,087
I want those two guys
banished from her life.

1576
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,795
I don't see what I can do.

1577
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,631
Well, go to the dean.
Maybe he can do something.

1578
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,545
Maybe he can
pull those creeps back.

1579
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:53,840
Do you realize
what you're asking?

1580
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:55,724
- That's a month-long debate...
- Right.

1581
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,977
And it could get
very complicated.

1582
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,689
All this for Carla Moran?

1583
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:06,273
Somebody's got
to look after her.

1584
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:08,529
Let her go, Phil.

1585
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:11,862
You don't have any choice,
professionally or personally.

1586
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:18,032
GENE: As you can see,
this is a freshly cut rose,

1587
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:21,041
and this is a container
of liquid helium,

1588
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,453
473 degrees below zero.

1589
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,417
This is the coldest substance
known to man.

1590
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,002
Anything frozen
at this temperature

1591
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,383
will shatter
at the slightest touch.

1592
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,773
What we are seeking
is to determine

1593
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,358
if this entity has mass.

1594
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,740
If in fact this is the case,

1595
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:55,526
then we should be able
to freeze it,

1596
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,946
verify its objective existence,

1597
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,160
and prove that it isn't
just a psychic projection...

1598
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:01,745
It's going to work great,
isn't it?

1599
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:04,660
...but rather an independent
force from some other

1600
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:07,751
level of reality
that has never been isolated.

1601
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:10,007
Here she is.

1602
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,253
Mrs. Moran.

1603
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:18,091
Let me take your bag.

1604
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,305
It's good to see you.

1605
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:23,472
We're all very excited
to get the experiment under way.

1606
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:28,435
- Welcome.
- GENE: Mrs. Moran.

1607
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,319
See you later.

1608
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:35,108
Have you made arrangements
for your children?

1609
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,244
- They're with a friend.
- Good.

1610
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:41,030
Let me show you
to your new house.

1611
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,080
I'm afraid we're not able

1612
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,620
to provide you
with all the conveniences,

1613
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:51,291
but we hope
you'll find it comfortable

1614
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:54,461
- and familiar.
- JOE: Watch your step.

1615
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:01,142
I think everyone's done a terrific
job in recreating your home.

1616
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,302
We did use different colors
on the walls.

1617
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:06,393
And there are other differences.
No light switches.

1618
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:09,525
We have to control
the electricity.

1619
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,654
This, of course,
is the children's room.

1620
01:43:12,812 --> 01:43:15,031
Yeah, the bed's
in the wrong place.

1621
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,612
Well, doesn't matter.

1622
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:19,743
There are no ceilings
anywhere in the house.

1623
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,404
That's for
the television monitoring.

1624
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:25,958
Except, of course,
in the bathroom.

1625
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:30,167
There is a ceiling,
but no plumbing.

1626
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:32,832
We'll supply you
with all the water you need.

1627
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,171
That's a chemical toilet.

1628
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:40,222
Does this look familiar?

1629
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:41,974
It's a good simulation.

1630
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:51,859
And remember
not to change in here.

1631
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:54,611
The television camera
will be watching you,

1632
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,195
and Gene at the controls.

1633
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:04,031
COOLEY: Now, in the kitchen,
we had a bit of a problem.

1634
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:07,040
No gas, but we have a hot plate

1635
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,543
and a well-stocked refrigerator.

1636
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:11,670
It's like camping out.

1637
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:20,259
Mrs. Moran, I'd like
to show you something now.

1638
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:24,096
Looks a lot like your house,
doesn't it?

1639
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,886
The living room.
Brought your books.

1640
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:29,180
Just stand over here with me.

1641
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:41,530
Mrs. Moran, this is the protected area
that we were talking about.

1642
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,694
It's two pieces of double-thick,
heat-treated glass

1643
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:45,829
with a vacuum
in between the panes.

1644
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:48,832
Now, the system is fail-safe.
We can't activate the helium

1645
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:51,039
until you're safely
behind this enclosure,

1646
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,671
so when we tell you to go
to the protected area,

1647
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,627
we want you to come
directly to this spot

1648
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,418
as quickly as possible,
and we'll take care of the rest.

1649
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:09,729
Okay?
Now we have to get ready.

1650
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:12,481
You make yourself
as comfortable as you can,

1651
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,483
but you're not alone.

1652
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:17,111
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

1653
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,570
I'm not afraid.

1654
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:25,320
If you can get him,

1655
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:27,454
I'm not afraid.

1656
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:30,457
Hey. Where do you think
you're going?

1657
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:32,789
- Is this the Cooley experiment?
- Yeah.

1658
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:35,705
Yeah, I'm with the Medical
Institute, Dr. Sneiderman.

1659
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:37,669
- Go right on in, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1660
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,627
(DOOR CLOSES)

1661
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:09,784
Carla.

1662
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:11,995
I'd like to talk to you alone.

1663
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:16,037
Is there any place
that we could go talk?

1664
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,334
That we could talk privately?

1665
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,128
The bathroom.

1666
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:37,938
This is quite a setup they have.

1667
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:42,276
They made a natural environment
for him so he'll come here.

1668
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:45,282
Really? Is that
what they're telling you?

1669
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,863
That's what they're doing.

1670
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:48,949
Uh-huh.
And you believe them?

1671
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:51,239
Oh, yes.

1672
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,625
They're dangerous frauds, Carla.
You're their guinea pig.

1673
01:46:57,453 --> 01:46:59,831
Carla, do you know
that there are tanks

1674
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:01,544
of liquid helium outside?
Did you know that?

1675
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:03,050
- Mm-hmm.
- You do?

1676
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,676
Do you know
what liquid helium can do?

1677
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:06,382
- Of course.
- Of course. Really?

1678
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:08,923
You understand what it means
to stop all molecular motion,

1679
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,183
paralyze atomic particles,
decompose matter?

1680
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:13,595
- Okay,
- Okay?

1681
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,435
What do you mean, okay?

1682
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:17,940
I mean I'd rather be dead

1683
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:20,692
than living the way
I've been living.

1684
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:22,694
Do you understand that?

1685
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,151
Yes, I can understand that.

1686
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,737
Yes. I also understand

1687
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,744
that I care very much
what happens to you,

1688
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:33,406
very much.

1689
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:36,872
And I know that, in your heart,

1690
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:40,288
you know the difference
between reality and fantasy.

1691
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,841
Carla, look at me. Carla.

1692
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,467
Our reason, our intelligence,

1693
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,048
that's the only thing
that distinguishes us

1694
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:49,009
between any other species
of animal.

1695
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:50,844
Carla, I care about you.

1696
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:53,475
Carla, don't close
yourself off now.

1697
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:56,979
It's real important, real important
that you maintain contact

1698
01:47:57,137 --> 01:48:00,391
with at least one person
that really cares about you.

1699
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:05,734
- I don't know what you're saying.
- I'll tell you what I am saying,

1700
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,819
that you and I
can make that contact.

1701
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,824
I don't want
to make that contact.

1702
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,082
Okay.

1703
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:32,180
JOE: Hey.
Wait up a minute, will you?

1704
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,808
Really.
I want to talk to you.

1705
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,810
I got to hand it to you.

1706
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:39,392
You just don't give up.

1707
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:42,354
