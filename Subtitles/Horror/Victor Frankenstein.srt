1083
01:21:54,174 --> 01:21:56,154
(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)

1084
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:55,477
<i>MONSTER: I shall collect my funeral pile
and consume to ashes this miserable frame.</i>

1085
01:22:57,037 --> 01:23:01,349
<i>That its remains may afford no light
to any curious and unhallowed wretch</i>

1086
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:03,854
<i>who would create such another
as I have been.</i>

1087
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:13,362
<i>She is dead, who called me into being.</i>

1088
01:23:14,488 --> 01:23:17,059
<i>When I shall be no more,</i>

1089
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:20,298
<i>the very remembrance of us both
will speedily vanish.</i>

1090
01:23:20,894 --> 01:23:24,137
<i>will no longer see the sun nor stars,</i>

1091
01:23:24,965 --> 01:23:27,309
<i>or feel the winds play upon my cheeks.</i>

1092
01:23:28,068 --> 01:23:30,912
<i>I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly</i>

1093
01:23:32,873 --> 01:23:35,581
<i>and exalt in the agony
of the torturing flames.</i>

1094
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:40,351
<i>The light of that conflagration
will fade away.</i>

1095
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:44,486
<i>My ashes will be swept into the sea
by the winds.</i>

1096
01:23:45,552 --> 01:23:47,759
<i>My spirit will sleep in peace.</i>

1097
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:52,632
<i>Or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.</i>

1098
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,468
<i>Farewell.</i>

1099
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:49,450
lam Adam!
