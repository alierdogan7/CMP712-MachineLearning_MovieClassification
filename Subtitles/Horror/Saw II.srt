           that fucking monitor?

236
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,464
      Well, I haven't           
      looked at the monitors    
      for some time,            

237
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,166
        so it would be          
        hard for me to say,     

238
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,603
        but I would imagine     
        that, um, he's cowering 
        in a corner             

239
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,104
      with a look on his face...

240
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,140
  You motherfucker!             
        No, Eric. Wait.         

241
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,308
        You motherfucker!       
       Where is he? Where is he?

242
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,811
        Where is he?            

243
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,546
      That's a problem you're   
      gonna have to solve       
      before it's too late.     

244
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,449
    He has about two hours      

245
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,751
      before the gas            
      creeping into             
      his nervous system        

246
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,354
    begins to break             
    down his body tissue        

247
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,190
      and he begins to bleed    
      from every orifice he has.

248
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,594
  Oh, yes. There will be blood. 

249
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,099
          Tell me where he is.  

250
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,601
          He's in a safe place. 

251
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,851
                Eric.           
  I need a phone.               

252
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,419
  Eric, just listen             
  to me for a second.           

253
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,687
        Just give me a phone!   

254
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,494
          Look, everything about
          this fits his profile.

255
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,663

        How do you just         
        wake up in a room       

280
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,887
      and have no idea          
      where you are?            

281
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,789
      I guess you never         
      been drunk before.        

282
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,524
        I've been drunk.        
        I spent three           
        years at college drunk. 

283
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,793
          This isn't drunk.     
          This is kidnapping.   

284
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,969
  Look, I, uh...                
  I saw this movie              
  on TV last week.              

285
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,339
  This guy, he was a reporter,  
  and he goes into              
  this war zone, right?         

286
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,274
  He goes in to                 
  sleep in his hotel room       
  the first night.              

287
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,276
  Bam! He wakes up              
  the next morning,             

288
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,279
  he's in a cell with           
  no windows and no light.      

289
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,982
      And he spent              
      nine years in that room.  

290
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,688
        Nine years?             
        Man, that's nothing.    
        Get over it.            

291

292

      about it and let's        
      do something.             

293
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,526
        I think we should       
        all just calm down.     

294
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,994
          Shut up! Shut up!

  the human puzzle.             
  The survival instinct.        

458
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:46,136
        This is all really,     
       really interesting, John,

459
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,171
              but right now     
             I'd really like for
            you to talk to me...

460
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,440
  I am talking to you.          

461
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,342
  You're not listening.         

462
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,611
  Don't forget the rules.       

463
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,146
           I'm listening to you,

464
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,417
            but all I'm hearing 
            is the same sick    
            fucking bullshit    

465
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,653
          that comes about      
          two seconds into every
        interview I've ever done

466
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,488
              with one of you   
              fucking people.   

467
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,557
  Well, that's                  
  an interesting approach       
  to police work, isn't it?     

468
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,628
  Aren't you supposed           
  to be convincing me           
  that I'm your friend,         

469
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,934
  lulling me into               
  a false sense of security     
  so that I'll confide in you?  

470
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,704
    It's a little hard          
    to follow the manual        
   when you've got my son, John.

471
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,173
        The manual?             

472
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,076
  What do you                   
  really wanna do to me         
  right now, huh?               

473
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,945
  What would you have done      
  five years ago, huh?          

474
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,013
  Would you have                
  followed the manual then?     

475
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:33,317
  Would you have broken my jaw  
  with a flashlight?            

476
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,720
            You seem to know    
           a whole lot about me.

477
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,223
  I know you were               
  once considered               
  a fearless police officer.    

478
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:47,297
  Do you feel a whole lot       
  safer now that you only       
  sit behind a desk?            

479
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,499
              I feel a whole lot
            of things right now.

480
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:52,736
  But you feel alive.           
  That's what you feel.         

481
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,604
  And that's the point.         

482
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,607
      Would you                 

483
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:02,112
    kindly get me               
    a glass of water?           

484
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,083
      I would very much         
      appreciate that.

          is between your legs.

509
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,177
    JONAS: My point is,         
    you didn't get that way     

510
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,511
        by teaching

512

          I think we should     
          be concentrating      
          on that tape,         

513
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:50,253
           'cause that tape said
            we have more in     
            common than we know.

514
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,622

            doing stretches...

  get the antidote?

684

            You're using

            for what you do?    

685
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:04,127
              No.

00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:10,166
        The cancer isn't

687
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,969
      It was the moment I       
      decided to end my life    

688
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,171
  that started me in my work    

689
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,073
  and brought meaning to it.    

690

  Do you appreciate your son's?

00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:09,418
  That's the second time        
  I've had to wake up

    Yeah, but I don't           
    really want to.             

718
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,562
  There's so much               
  left to do.                   

719
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,466

720
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,304
  This can't be it.             

721
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,311
                It's not.       

722
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,588
            Amanda, you said you
           survived this, right?
          I what?               

723
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,026

            whoever's doing it, 

724
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:52,628
        you said that           
        you've played before    
        and you survived.       

725
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,964
        Yeah.                   

726
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,933
            So that means       
            we could survive.   

727
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:01,070
            Yeah.               

728
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,139
  Wait. Amanda,                 
  why did he pick you?          

729
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,976
            Because I was       
            a fucking junkie.   

730
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:19,021
        And the funny thing is, 
       I passed his little test.

731
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,260
    If you passed his test,     
    then why are you back here?

736
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,187
                  But I thought 
                you said that...

737
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:54,056
  Maybe you should talk         
  to the cop who arrested me.   

738
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,462
      I'm guessing              
      you've never been         
      arrested before.          

739
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:02,231
                  No. Um...     

740
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:05,267
    I mean, I've been in trouble
      a few times, you know,

            He's a real hardass.

743
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:18,481
      You know, he's            
      probably got half the city
      right now looking for me  

744
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:21,417
      just so he can kick my ass
      for disappearing on him.  

745
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,387
          Yeah.

            Yeah.               

1158
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:23,510
    <i> I found myself a father,</i>

  Those who don't

      He asked for you.         

1172
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,416
      What the fuck do you want?
        I told you.             

1173
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:03,550
  He wants us to survive this.  

1174

  I want to play a game.        

1175

  You have to play              
  by the fucking rules!         

1176
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:08,872
    The rules are simple.       

1177
01:27:08,873 --> 01:27:10,289
  All you have to do is         
  sit here and talk to me.      

1178
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:12,392
                  What?         

1179
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,760
    If you can do               
    that long enough,           
    you will find your son

01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:15,229
  in a safe and secure state.   

1181

          What the fuck is that?

1182
01:27:16,748 --> 01:27:18,264
  It's your son, Daniel.        
  You remember him, don't you?

  Don't forget the rules.       

1193

            Shut the fuck up!   

1194
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:36,683
        He's playing a game.    

1195
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:37,551
  I don't wanna talk to him.    

1196

        You're not saying shit. 

1197
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:40,721
  We both know                  
  the sort of person you are.

  There's something             
  I haven't told you, Eric.
