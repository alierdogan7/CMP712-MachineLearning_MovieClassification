00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,000
That's a hunting
blow-dart pipe

181
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,545
from northern
Papua New Guinea.

182
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,582
That's very, very rare
since the tribe
is now extinct.

183
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,481
They couldn't hunt shit
with these things,

184
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,609
would be my guess.

185
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,812
What's the point anyway?

186
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,252
If the man is gone,
he's gone.

187
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,619
Why should he bother us?

188
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,715
Maybe to take
what you got.

189
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,222
Maybe to work your nerves.

190
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,659
Or maybe to just come back

191
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,426
and skull-fuck you
in your sleep.

192
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,134
He sounds like a charmer.

193
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,042
For you.

194
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,077
Let's just get...
Here we go.

195
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,922
Yeah?
Yeah.

196
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,082
Imam, if we're
looking for water,
we should leave soon,

197
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,651
before nightfall,
while it's cooler.

198
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,688
Ali.

199
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,629
Excuse me.

200
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,127
I think
you should see this.

201
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,740
3 suns?

202
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,306
Bloody hell.

203
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,813
So much for your nightfall.

204
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,450
So much
for my cocktail hour.

205
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,918
We take this
as a good sign.

206
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,891
A path,
direction from Allah.

207
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,591
Blue sun, blue water.

208
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,596
Ever wondered
why I'm an atheist?

209
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,330
It's a bit of a bad sign.
That's Riddick's direction.

210
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,395
I thought you found
his restraints over there,

211
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,599
towards sunset.

212
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,404
Right. Which means
he went towards sunrise.

213
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,177
Zeke.

214
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,009
Fully loaded clip.
Safety's on.

215
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,412
One shot
if you spot him, ok?

216
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,747
Don't tell me
you're going, too.
Yeah.

217
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,082
What happens if
Mr. Riddick spots us first?

218
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,346
[laughing]

219
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,753
There'll be no shots.

220
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,915
[Imam chanting in Arabic]

221
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,134
<i>Allahu Akbar...</i>

222
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,364
(Johns)
Quiet!

223
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,929
Shh, shh, shh.

224
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,536
[crackling]

225
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,415
[Hassan shouting]

226
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,523
7 stones
to keep the devil at bay.

227
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,427
You're on a trip
to New Mecca, right?

228
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,295
Once in every lifetime,
should there be a great hajj.

229
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,856
A great pilgrimage.

230
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,199
To get to know Allah better?

231
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,329
Yes, but to know yourself,
as well.

232
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,496
Yeah.

233
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,001
We are all on
the same hajj now.

234
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,325
[gasps]

235
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,383
[gun clicking]

236
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,255
Sorry.

237
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,529
So did you
see anything?

238
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,269
No Riddick.

239
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,371
Trees, and trees mean water.

240
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,612
You comfy up there?

241
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,950
It's amazing how you can do
without necessities of life,

242
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,613
provided you have
the little luxuries.

243
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,022
Just keep your
bloody eyes open.

244
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,289
I don't want that dog
sneaking up on my bloody ass.

245
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,131
Yes, well,
you dig the graves.

246
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,701
I'll hold the fort, old boy.

247
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,103
[gasps]
Christ!

248
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,734
He could probably get you
right here, right under
the jaw

249
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,675
and you'd never
even hear him coming,

250
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,178
'cause that's how good
Riddick is.

251
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,306
Tell me something,
did you run away
from your parents

252
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,316
or did they run away
from you?

253
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,115
[men speaking Arabic]

254
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,945
(Imam)
It's a communal graveyard,

255
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,417
perhaps like
the elephants of Earth.

256
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,282
[man speaking Arabic]

257
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,620
He asks what could have
killed so many great things.

258
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,326
Is this
whole planet dead?

259
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,455
Drink?

260
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,320
Probably shouldn't do this.

261
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,291
It dehydrates you
even more.

262
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,631
You're probably right.

263
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,755
Mmm.

264
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,701
You know, you could have
stayed back at the ship.
Probably should've.

265
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,761
If we don't find water,
you know what happens.

266
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,136
I wanted to get away.

267
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,301
I've never seen a captain
so ready to leave her ship.

268
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,969
I think we should
keep moving.

269
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,775
What did Owens mean

270
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,243
about not touching
the handle?

271
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,386
It's just between you and me,
Carolyn. I promise.

272
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,861
I'm not your captain.

273
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,430
During the landing,

274
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,374
when things were
at their worst,
Owens was at his best.

275
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,204
He's the one that
stopped the docking pilot

276
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,371
from dumping
the main cabin.

277
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,844
The passengers.

278
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,079
And the docking pilot being?

279
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,659
I guess I'm a little more glad
to be here than I thought.

280
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,218
[gun clicking]

281
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,612
Hassan. Suleiman.

282
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,745
Captain.

283
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,380
[speaking Arabic]

284
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,193
[whirring]

285
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,996
[man chattering in Arabic]

286
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,749
(Jack)
Is there anyone here?

287
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,484
[rattling]

288
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,299
There was water here.

289
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,203
Lights?

290
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,704
Lights on?

291
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,310
Ok.

292
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,197
[speaking Arabic]

293
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,665
They are saying
God is great.

294
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,501
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i> Yes.

295
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,533
This is the source
of the water.

296
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,149
No darkness.

297
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,383
No lights
because no darkness.

298
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,160
[whooping]

299
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,933
Hello, Mecca!

300
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,218
[clanging]

301
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,131
Tell me that was you
just now.

302
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,795
What are you
going on about?

303
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,530
He's been right here
helping me.

304
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,801
Back of the ship.
That noise.

305
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,604
You trying to tell me
that was someone else?

306
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,543
[inaudible]

307
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,878
No!

308
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,345
[gasps]

309
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,141
Oh, my God.
I thought I was the only one

310
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,651
who got out
of the crash alive.

311
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
[gun firing]

312
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,413
(Paris)
Christ!

313
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:40,995
It was just somebody else.
It was just somebody else
from the crash!

314
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,667
Crikey. I thought
it was him.

315
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,670
I thought it was Riddick.

316
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,506
No juice.

317
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,880
It looks like
it's been laid up for years.

318
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,475
We might be able
to adapt it to...

319
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,713
Shut up.

320
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,921
Sorry. I thought
I heard something.

321
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,325
Like what?

322
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:12,685
Gunshots.

331
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,776
Piece of shit!

332
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,454
(Shazza)
What did you do to Zeke?

333
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,550
(Jack)
What did you do to him?
Just kill him.

334
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,026
Just somebody
goddamn kill him
before he...

335
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,430
So where's the body?

336
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,965
Well, do you want to tell me
about the sounds?

337
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,140
Look, you told Johns
you heard something.

338
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,881
That's fine.

339
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,642
You don't want to talk to me,
that's your choice,

340
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,619
but just so you know...

341
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,753
there's a debate right now
as to whether

342
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,849
we should leave
you here to die.

343
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,957
You mean
the whispers?

344
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,699
What whispers?

345
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,802
The ones telling me
to go for the sweet spot

346
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,574
just to the left
of the spine.

347
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,975
4th lumbar down,

348
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,974
the abdominal aorta.

349
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,179
It's a metallic taste,
human blood.

350
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,244
Copperish.

351
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,620
If you cut it
with peppermint schnapps,
it goes away...

352
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,455
Do you want to shock me
with the truth now?

353
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,660
All you people
are so scared of me.

354
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,564
Most days, I'd take that
as a compliment.

355
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,069
But it ain't me
you gotta worry about now.

356
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,434
Show me your eyes, Riddick.

357
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,942
You'd have to come
a lot closer for that.

358
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,288
Closer.

359
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,821
Where the hell
can I get eyes like that?

360
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,253
You gotta kill a few people.

361
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,655
Ok, I can do it.

362
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,618
Then you gotta
get sent to a slam,

363
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,028
where they tell you
you'll never see
daylight again.

364
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,127
You dig up a doctor

365
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,828
and you pay him
20 menthol Kools

366
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,304
to do a surgical shine job
on your eyeballs.

367
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,967
So you can see
who's sneaking up
on you in the dark?

368
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,304
Exactly.
Leave!

369
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,172
Leave.

370
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,614
Cute kid.

371
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,122
Did I kill
a few people?

372
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,084
Sure.

373
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,786
Did I kill Zeke?

374
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,122
No.

375
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,133
You got the wrong killer.

376
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,261
He's not in the hole.
We looked.

377
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,998
Look deeper.

378
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,935
(Johns)
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

379
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,537
I think he went off
on the guy,
buried him in the hills.

380
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,639
Now he's got you believing
there's something there.

381
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,910
Well, let's just be sure.

382
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,576
Look, murders aside,

383
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,985
Riddick belongs
in the asshole hall of fame.

384
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,455
He loves to jaw-jack
and loves to make you
feel afraid,

385
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,118
because that's all he has.
You're playing right into it.

386
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,751
Why try to
explain this to you?

387
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,194
You're a cop. For God's sake,
we've got to find his body.

388
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,288
Hey! I'll go.

389
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,026
Look, no one is going.
Stay here.

390
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,662
Look, being ballsy
with your life

391
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,296
doesn't change
what came before.
It's stupid.

392
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,466
What, do you think
I'm trying to
prove something?

393
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,232
Well, are you?

394
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,052
They're hollow.

395
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,589
[grunting]

396
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,023
[yells]

397
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,034
[screaming]

398
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,709
(Fry)
I'm in here!

399
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,010
I'm in here. I'm inside!

400
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,015
I thought
I heard something.

401
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,783
Please, can you hear me?

402
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,025
[Fry yelling]

403
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,904
Help me.

404
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,089
Give me your goddamn hand.

405
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,332
I heard you, Fry.
I heard you first.

406
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,528
Come on.

407
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,070
Fry, are you ok?

408
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,935
What's down there?
What is it?

409
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,201
Did you find Zeke?

410
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,503
(Paris)
You're all right.

411
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,770
Fry, are you ok?

412
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,811
Ok.

413
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,004
Fuck!

414
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,047
That was so fucking stupid.

415
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,173
I don't know
what the fuck is in there,

416
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,286
but whatever it is,
it got Zeke
and it nearly got me!

417
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:32,984
[yelling]

418
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,616
Get it off me!

419
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,827
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

420
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,229
Watch it. Watch your head.

421
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,365
Finally found something
worse than me, huh?

422
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,334
So here's the deal.

423
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,406
You work without chains,
without bit,
and without shivs.

424
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,280
You do what I say,
when I say it.

425
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,750
For what?

426
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:08,020
The honor of going back
to some asshole of a cell?
Fuck you.

427
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,518
The truth is

428
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,587
I'm tired of chasing you.

429
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,828
Are you saying
you'd cut me loose?

430
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,199
I'm thinking you
could have died
in the crash.

431
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,171
My recommendation: Do me.

432
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,208
Don't take the chance

433
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,304
that I'll get shiv-happy
on your wanna-be ass.

434
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,381
Ok.

435
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,077
Ghost me, mother-fucker.
That's what I'd do to you.

436
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,188
I want you
to remember this moment.

437
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,032
The way it could have gone
and didn't.

438
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,032
Here.

439
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,334
Take it easy.

440
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,400
Fuck you!

441
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,582
Do we have a deal?

442
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,056
I want you
to remember this moment.

443
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,797
Just one?

444
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:30,863
For now.

445
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,545
So, click your fingers,
and he's one of us now?

446
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,245
I didn't say that,

447
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,382
but at least this way,
I don't have to worry
about y'all, uh,

448
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,587
falling asleep
and not waking up.

449
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,651
So, can I talk
to him now?

450
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,662
(both)
No.

451
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,062
Blast.

452
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,072
Paris P. Ogilvie.

453
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,908
Antiquities dealer,
entrepreneur.

454
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,047
Richard B. Riddick.

455
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,553
Escaped convict,
murderer.

456
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,020
That's... That's
a particularly good Shiraz.

457
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,558
It's... It's
a lovely drop.

458
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,924
It's... It's
very expensive.

459
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,122
By all means,
please help yourself.

460
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,068
I mean, normally I can
appreciate antiques.

461
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,000
But this,
this is something else.

462
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,126
It'll work.

463
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,099
It's nothing
we can't repair,

464
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,936
so long as
the electrical adapts.

465
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,238
Well, it's not
a star-jumper.

466
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,775
(Riddick)
It doesn't need to be.

467
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,438
Take a 2-seater
like this back up

468
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,311
to the Sol-Track
shipping lanes.

469
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,910
Stick out her thumb,
bound to get picked up.

470
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,215
Ain't that right, captain?

471
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,325
Can I have
a little help here?

472
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,189
I got it.
Come on.

473
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

474
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,858
Do me a favor.

475
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,536
Check these containers out
and, uh,

476
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,836
see what we can patch
these wings up with.

477
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,800
All right?

478
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,002
[squeaking]

479
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,525
[chuckling]

480
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,689
Mine!

481
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,061
<i>Insha Allah!</i>

482
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,532
All right, all right.
My turn.

483
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,375
Are you all right?

484
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,136
[speaking Arabic]

485
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,772
Ok.

486
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,035
[whirring]

487
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,342
[beeping]

488
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,042
And we are getting there.

489
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,384
So we've got enough power
for a sys-check,

490
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,890
but we'll still
need more cells.

491
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,720
How many are we
talking about?

492
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,783
Um.

493
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,554
Let's see,
we got a 90-gig draw.

494
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,599
The other ship
takes 20-gig cells.

495
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,362
That would be 5.

496
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,993
5 total to launch.

497
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,471
35 kilos each, huh?
Fuck.

498
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,030
Well, that's
pretty heavy.

499
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,240
Well, you know that old
sand cat out there?

500
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,243
Mmm-hmm.

501
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,746
I might be able
to get it going.

502
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,175
Yeah. Do it if you can,
but if you need a hand...

503
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,916
Where did Riddick go?

504
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,692
Let's go.

505
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,039
[rattling]

506
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,168
[Johns whistling]

507
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,033
You're missing the party.

508
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,669
Come on, boy.

509
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,001
[gasps]

510
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,881
You're missing the party.
Come on.

511
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,184
Oh, man.

512
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,817
[whirring]

513
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,052
[Imam speaking Arabic]

514
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,322
All praises be Allah,
for His many blessings to us.

515
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:51,528
What?

516
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,895
It's the winner
of the look-alike contest.

517
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,111
[beeping]

518
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,088
Who were these people anyway,
miners?

519
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,886
I don't know.
Looks like geologists.

520
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,291
You know, an advance team,
moves around
from rock to rock.

521
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,795
Nice of them
to leave so much stuff here.

522
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,798
Why'd they leave their ship?

523
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,235
[whirring]

524
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,410
It's not a ship,
it's a skiff.

525
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,846
And it's disposable, really.

526
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,350
It's more like an emergency
life raft, right?

527
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,444
Yeah, they probably had
a big drop ship
take them off planet.

528
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,648
These people didn't leave.
Come on.

529
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,385
Whoever got Zeke
got them.

530
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,421
They're all dead.

531
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,532
You don't really think
they left

532
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,363
with their clothes
on the hooks,

533
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,402
photos on the shelves.

534
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,701
Maybe they had weight limits.
You don't know.

535
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,502
I know you don't prep
your emergency ship

536
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,236
unless there's
a fucking emergency.

537
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,334
He's fucking right.

538
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,400
Watch your mouth.

539
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,913
He's just saying
what we're all thinking.

540
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,445
So what happened?
Where are they?

541
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,784
Has anyone seen
the little one? Ali?

542
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,453
Has anyone checked
the coring room?

543
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,824
[screeching]

544
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:34,726
[yelling]

545
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,629
Ali.

546
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:38,897
Come on.

547
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,479
[screaming]

548
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,713
[gasping]

549
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,950
[panting]

550
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,232
[gun firing]

551
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,271
Ali.
Slowly.

552
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,075
Jack, wait. Wait!

553
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,172
(Imam)
Ali.

554
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,740
Ali.

555
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,544
Ali.

556
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,493
[gasps]

557
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:53,974
Ali?

558
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,377
[yells]

559
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,132
[creatures screeching]

560
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,481
(Johns)
Imam?

561
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,541
Imam?

562
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,959
[speaking Arabic]

563
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,483
(Riddick)
Other buildings
weren't secure,

564
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,687
so they ran here.

565
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,486
Heaviest doors.

566
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,292
Thought they'd
be safe inside,

567
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,160
but they forgot
to lock the cellar.

568
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,266
Here.

569
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,045
What, it's broken?

570
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,247
No. There's still
a few hits.

571
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,883
Actually, you asshole,
I'm trying to say
that I'm sorry.

572
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:47,260
Ok, let's board this place up
and get the hell out of here.

573
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,467
Whatever the fuck
those things were,

574
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,971
they seem to stick
to darkness.

575
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,439
So, if we stick to daylight,
we should be all right, ok?

576
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,497
Let's go.

577
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:00,702
22 years ago.

578
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,169
What?

579
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,911
These coring samples
are dated.

580
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,951
Last one's 22 years ago
this month.

581
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,816
Is there something special
about that, Carolyn?

582
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,980
I don't know.

583
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,114
There could be.

584
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,729
An eclipse.

585
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,840
You're not afraid
of the dark, are you?

586
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,773
So we gotta get
the power cells.

587
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,075
I've still gotta
check on the hull
and patch the wings.

588
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,479
Wait on the power cells.

589
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,779
What? Wait for what?
Until it's too dark
to get back?

590
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,376
We don't know
when it'll happen.
Let's not get overexcited.

591
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,048
Just get the fucking cells
here, Johns.

592
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,748
What... What
is the discussion?

593
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,656
Maybe I should tell you
how Riddick escaped.

594
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,126
(Fry)
He can pilot?

595
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,993
(Johns)
He hijacked
a prison transport,

596
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,693
made a hell of a good run
before I tracked his ass down.

597
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,428
Ok, ok,
maybe that's a good thing.

598
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,130
Maybe we can use him
to help us navigate
or something.

599
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,038
He also figured out
how to kill the pilot.

600
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,505
Look, you told me
we could trust him.

601
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,307
You said that
we had a deal, Johns.

602
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,838
Now, you may have noticed
that chains don't work
on this guy.

603
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,508
Now the only way
you people are truly safe

604
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,577
is if he believes
he's going free.

605
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,121
Let's just say
he stops believing...

606
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,852
You mean if he realizes
that we're going to royally
fuck him over.

607
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,621
I want you to listen
to me for a second.

608
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:00,128
If we bring the cells up
at the last possible minute

609
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,392
when the wings are ready
and we're ready to launch...

610
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,299
He hasn't harmed any of us.
He hasn't even lied to us.

611
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,768
Let's just stick to the deal.

612
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,997
He's a killer.

613
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,834
The law says
he has to do his bid.

614
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,533
There's nothing
I can do about that.

615
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,973
You hear me?

616
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,404
You're dancing
on razor blades here.

617
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,407
I'm not gonna
give him a chance
to grab another ship

618
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,315
or slash
another pilot's throat.

619
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,881
Not on my watch.

620
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:36,888
[groaning]

621
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,835
(Riddick)
Bad sign.

622
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,770
Shaking like that
in this heat.

623
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,703
I thought
I said no shivs... shivs.

624
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:52,573
This?

625
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,781
This is just a personal
grooming appliance.

626
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,496
Thanking you.

627
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,371
Looks like we're a few shy.

628
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,775
Power cells.

629
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,143
They're coming.

630
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:30,345
It's strange,
not doing a run-up
on the main drive yet.

631
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,549
Unless...

632
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,027
Unless he told you

633
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,757
the particulars
of my escape.

634
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,265
I got the quick
and ugly version.

635
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,428
Now you're worried
about a repeat of history.

636
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,529
It has entered
our minds.

637
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,839
I asked what you thought.

638
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:58,814
You scare me, Riddick.

639
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,645
That's what
you want to hear, isn't it?

640
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,776
Now can I just
get back to work?

641
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:06,079
I've been meaning
to catch up with you alone,

642
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,123
unrestrained.

643
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,725
Do you think...

644
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,386
You think Johns

645
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,194
is a do-right man?
You think I can
trust him to cut me loose?

646
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,503
Why? What did you hear?

647
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,396
Well,

648
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,103
guess if it were trickeration,
he'd just "X" me out, huh?

649
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,978
He'd kill me.

650
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,013
Then again,

651
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,350
I am worth
twice as much alive.

652
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,311
Oh, you didn't know that?

653
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,756
Your Johns ain't a cop.

654
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,159
He's got that
nickel-slick badge

655
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,596
and that blue uniform,

656
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,968
but he's just a merc.

657
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,810
And I'm just a payday.

658
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,348
That's why
he won't kill me, see?

659
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:09,944
The creed is greed.

660
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,147
Don't waste my time.

661
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,991
We're not gonna
turn on each other,
no matter how hard you try.

662
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,560
[clicking]

663
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,033
I don't know truly
what's gonna happen

664
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,001
when the lights
go out, Carolyn.

665
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,096
But I do know
once the dying starts,

666
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,902
this little
psycho-fuck family of ours

667
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,876
is gonna
rip itself apart.

668
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,511
Ever wonder why
Johns shakes like that?

669
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,114
Ask him.

670
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:49,188
Ask why your crew pal
had to scream so painfully
before he died.

671
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,895
So who are you,
really?

672
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,094
You're not a cop,
are you?

673
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,896
I never said I was a cop.

674
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,337
No, you didn't.

675
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,404
And you never said
you were a hype, either.

676
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,279
You have caffeine
in the morning,

677
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,783
I have a little morphine.
So what?

678
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,549
You got 2 mornings every day.
Wow, you were born lucky.

679
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,953
It's not a problem unless...

680
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,458
No, it becomes a problem

681
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,687
when you let
Owens die like that.

682
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,896
We have enough drugs here
to knock out
a fucking mule team.

683
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,865
Owens was already dead.

684
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,731
His brain just hadn't caught
on to the facts.

685
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,934
Is there anything else
I should know
about you, Johns?

686
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,010
You know, I...

687
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,238
I'm letting you
roll the dice on our lives.

688
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,146
It is not unreasonable...

689
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,720
Do you feel that?

690
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,690
That's my first
run-in with Riddick.

691
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,256
He went for the sweet spot
and missed.

692
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,095
They had to leave a piece
of the shiv in there, Carolyn,

693
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,259
and I can feel it
pressing against the cord.

694
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:42,770
So maybe the care and feeding
of my nerve endings
is my business.

695
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,082
It's just that you could've
done something,
and you didn't.

696
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,049
Yeah, well, look to thine
own ass first. Right, Carolyn?

697
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,557
(Hassan)
Captain! Captain!

698
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,054
[speaking Arabic]

699
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,658
I'm not
your fucking captain.

700
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,888
What are
my eyes seeing?

701
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:42,020
If we need anything
from the crash ship,
I suggest we kick on.

702
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,690
That sand cat's solar.

703
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,840
Where's Riddick?

704
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,775
Leave him.
He wouldn't wait for us.

705
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,049
Thought
we'd lost you.

706
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,611
Johns!

707
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,530
[grunting]

708
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,301
Hey! Where are you going?

709
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,865
I'm just gonna
get a couple things.
I'll only be a few minutes.

710
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,778
You wouldn't leave
without me, would you?

711
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,115
[chattering]

712
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,348
[muttering]

713
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:20,480
Shit.

714
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,922
[wind howling]

715
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,828
[creature wailing]

716
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,220
How many are there?

717
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,431
Beautiful.

718
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:06,729
Allah.

719
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,037
People,
just a suggestion.

720
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,939
Perhaps you should flee!

721
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,503
Let's go!

722
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,009
Come on, run!

723
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,376
Shit!

724
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,554
Come on!

725
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,329
[creatures screeching]

726
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,630
(Fry)
Get in!

727
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:43,900
Get down!

728
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,164
[grunts]

729
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,057
No.

730
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,262
Stay there! Stay down, Shazza!
Just stay down.

731
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,459
Come back here!

732
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,201
[gasping]

733
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,734
Shazza, stay down!

734
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,545
[screaming]

735
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,433
Please, I really think
we should go inside.

736
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,495
We have to be inside
to be able to close the door.

737
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,268
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go.

738
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,939
[creatures wailing]

739
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,477
[rumbling]

740
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,356
What is it, Riddick?
What is it now?

741
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,425
Like I said,

742
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,963
it ain't me
you gotta worry about.

743
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,397
(Jack)
She should've stayed down.

744
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:54,663
If she only would have
stayed down, she'd be ok.

745
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,637
She wouldn't have died.

746
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,640
(Johns)
You remember the boneyard?

747
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,373
These just might
be the fuckers

748
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,038
that killed every
living thing on this planet.

749
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,247
(Jack)
What are we gonna do now?

750
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,642
(Paris)
Are these the only lights
we have? Is this everything?

751
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,245
There's a cutting torch
on the floor here somewhere.

752
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,311
I just can't find it.

753
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,550
(Imam)
Quiet, please, everyone.

754
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,857
[creatures wailing]

755
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,500
Why do they do that,
make that sound?

756
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,871
Perhaps it's the way
they see

757
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,472
with sound
reflecting back...

758
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,041
[rattling]

759
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,386
Could be a breach in the hull.
I don't know.

760
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,518
Come on, Johns.
You got the big gauge.

761
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:54,692
(Johns)
I'd rather piss glass.

762
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:56,391
Why don't you
go fucking check?

763
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,989
(Paris)
I'm not staying here anymore.

764
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,432
Where you going?
Hey! Hey!

765
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,434
(Fry)
Paris!

766
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,492
Paris!

767
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,004
(Johns)
Sit him down.

768
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,597
You don't know
what's out there.

769
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,142
I know what's in here.

770
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,232
[grunting]

771
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,609
[speaking Arabic]

772
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,240
Hurry!

773
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,924
(Paris)
Now we're trapped in a much
smaller space. I hate this!

774
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,223
[yelling]

775
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,904
[gun firing]

776
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,601
[grunting]

777
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:03,719
[gasps]

778
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:09,364
Extremely bad timing.

779
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,636
Just don't run.

780
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,005
Riddick?

781
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,108
Don't stop burning.

782
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,550
Take this.

783
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,609
Take that.

784
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,677
Ok.

785
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,333
Hassan.
Where is Hassan?

786
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,052
[screeching]

787
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,354
[yells]

788
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,167
[gun firing]

789
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,366
[screaming]

790
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,484
Is it alive?

791
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:45,924
[sizzling]

792
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,622
It's like
the light is scalding it.

793
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,325
It hurts them.

794
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,159
Light actually
hurts them.

795
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,497
[gasping]

796
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,299
[creatures squealing]

797
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,071
Hassan.

798
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,036
We'll burn
a candle for him later.

799
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,772
Come on,
let's get out of here.

800
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,916
(Fry)
So we got one cutting torch,

801
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,782
we got 2 hand lights.

802
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,282
There's gotta be something
we can rip out
of the crash ship.

803
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,915
(Paris)
Spirits.

804
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,955
Anything over 45 proof
burns rather well.

805
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,121
How many bottles
you got?

806
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,630
I don't know. Maybe 10.

807
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,558
Ok, Johns,
you got some flares.

808
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,165
So, maybe we've got
enough light.

809
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,536
Enough for
fucking what?

810
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,404
We stick to the plan.

811
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,201
We get the 4 cells back
to the skiff,

812
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:37,809
we're off this rock.

813
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,145
Look, I hate to ruin
a beautiful theory
with an ugly fact,

814
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,715
but that sand cat is solar.
It won't run at night.

815
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,719
So we carry the cells.

816
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,023
We drag them,
whatever it takes.

817
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:52,254
You mean tonight, with all
those things still out there?

818
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,455
All right,
how long can this last?

819
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,160
A few hours? A day, tops?

820
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,225
I have the impression
from the model.

821
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,002
The 2 planets
were moving as one,

822
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,536
and there would be
a lasting darkness.

823
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,574
Mmm. These suns gotta
come up sometime.

824
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,207
And if these creatures
are phobic about light,
then we just sit tight,

825
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,978
and we let the sun come up.

826
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,383
I'm sure somebody else
said that

827
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,112
locked inside
that coring room.

828
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,784
We need to think
about everybody now,
especially the kid.

829
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,417
How scared will
he be in the dark?

830
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,018
Don't use him like that.

831
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,427
Like what?
As a smoke screen.

832
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,759
You deal with your own fear.

833
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,096
Why don't you shut
your fucking mouth
for 2 seconds

834
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,601
and let me come up
with a plan

835
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,364
that doesn't involve
mass suicide.

836
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,368
[creatures wailing]

837
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,231
I'm waiting.

838
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,606
How much you weigh, Johns?

839
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,111
What's it matter, Carolyn?

840
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,443
How much?

841
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,583
Around 79 kilos.

842
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,142
'Cause you're 79 kilos
of gutless white meat.

843
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,380
That's why
you can't think...

844
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,149
Is that fucking right?

845
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:55,622
Where are you going?

846
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,090
This solves nothing.

847
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,326
Ok.

848
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,205
They're afraid
of our light.

849
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,008
That means we don't have
to be so afraid of them.

850
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,846
And you are sure
you can get us there,

851
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,445
even in the dark?

852
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,755
No, I can't.

853
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:30,958
But he can.

854
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,645
[whispering]
Stay close.

855
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,156
Ok, wait. Wait!

856
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,861
Riddick.

857
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,480
Looks clear.

858
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,391
[screeching]

859
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,290
You said "clear."

860
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:43,796
I said it looks clear.

861
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,691
What's it look like now?

862
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,072
Looks clear.

863
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:14,786
I'll be running
about 10 paces ahead.

864
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,024
I want light on my back,
but not my eyes.

865
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,429
And check your cuts.

866
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,466
These bad boys
know our blood now.

867
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,417
Are we actually
going to do this?

868
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,924
We stay together,
we keep the light burning.

869
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,857
That's all we gotta do
to live through this thing.

870
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,006
Are you ready, Johns?

871
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,336
Yeah.

872
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,905
Look, we're just
wasting light here.

873
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:14,022
You give him
the cells and the ship

874
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,420
and he'll leave you
all out there to die.

875
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:19,926
He'll leave
all of you.

876
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,930
I don't get it, Johns.

877
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,595
What is so goddamn valuable
in your life

878
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,465
that you're worried
about losing?

879
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,635
Is there anything at all

880
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,408
besides your next spike?

881
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,390
Stay close.

882
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,605
Wait.

883
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,799
Jack!

884
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,613
[screeching]

885
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:50,610
[chattering]

886
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:53,778
[grunts]

887
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:54,845
Jack.

888
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,749
[gasps]

889
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,629
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

890
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,996
Paris, get back here!

891
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:20,943
Are you all right?

892
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,507
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

893
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:28,850
[creature hissing]

894
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:32,249
[gasps]

895
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,498
I was supposed
to die in France.

896
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,105
I never even saw France.

897
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,110
[creatures screeching]

898
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:03,088
Well, it's good
to see you're ok.

899
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,368
Do I even wanna know?

900
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,354
Are we getting close?

901
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,160
Can we pick up
the pace?

902
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:44,161
[speaking Arabic]

903
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,603
Wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

904
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,160
We crossed our own tracks.

905
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,138
Why have we circled?
Are we lost?

906
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,196
Listen.

907
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,604
Do you even know
where we are?

908
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:55,870
Listen!

909
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,512
Canyon ahead. I circled once
to buy some time to think.

910
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,689
I think we should go now.

911
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,728
Oh, I don't know
about that.

912
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,987
That's death row
up there.

913
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,763
Especially
with the girl bleeding.

914
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:19,994
What?

915
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:21,529
What are you
talking about?

916
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:22,729
She's not cut.

917
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:23,793
Not her.

918
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,297
Her.

919
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,218
You've gotta be kidding me.

920
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,953
I... I just thought
it'd be better if people
took me for a guy.

921
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,615
I thought they'd
leave me alone

922
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,659
instead of always
messing with me.

923
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:48,084
[sobs]

924
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,556
I'm sorry.

925
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,457
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

926
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,091
Are you really bleeding?

927
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,796
You could've left me
at the ship, Fry.

928
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,362
That's why I didn't say
anything sooner.

929
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,137
They've been
nose-open for her
ever since we left.

930
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,470
In case you haven't noticed,
they go off blood.

931
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:07,481
Look, this is
not gonna work.

932
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,815
We're gonna have to go back.

933
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:12,809
What'd you say?

934
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,856
You're the one who got us
out here in the first place.

935
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,756
I was wrong. I admit it.

936
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:20,852
Ok, can we just get back
to the ship?

937
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:22,328
I don't know, Carolyn.

938
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,989
Nice breeze,
wide-open space.

939
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:25,727
I'm starting to enjoy
my fucking self.

940
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,393
What, are you high again?

941
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:28,902
Just listen to yourself,
Johns.

942
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,097
No, no, you're right, Carolyn.
What's to be afraid of?

943
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:34,506
My life is a steaming pile
of meaningless shit anyhow,

944
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:36,203
so I say mush on.

945
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:40,103
The canyon's only
a couple hundred meters,
after that it's skiff city.

946
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:41,513
So why don't you butch up,

947
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,744
stuff a cork in
this fucking kid,
and let's go.

948
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,049
She is the captain.
We should listen to her.

949
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,315
Listen to her?

950
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,915
When she was so willing
to sacrifice us all.

951
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,050
What's he
talking about?

952
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,219
This does not help us.

953
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,729
During the crash,
she tried to blow
the passenger cabin,

954
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:56,821
kill us in our sleep.

955
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,196
Shut your mouth.
We are fucking disposable.

956
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,962
We're just
walking ghosts to you.

957
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,697
Shut your fucking blowhole!

958
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,663
Fine. Fine!

959
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,765
You've made your point.

960
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,407
We'll all be scared.

961
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,672
Oh, Carolyn,

962
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,271
how much do you weigh now?

963
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:16,548
The verdict's in.
The light moves forward.

964
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:28,554
Ain't all of us
gonna make it.

965
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,063
Just realize that?

966
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,000
6 of us left.

967
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,993
If we can make it through
the canyon

968
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:38,130
and lose just one,
that'd be quite a feat, huh?

969
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,673
Not if I'm the one.

970
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,265
What if you're one of 5?

971
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,138
I'm listening.

972
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,752
What are they doing up there?

973
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:59,260
They're talking about
the canyon, I suppose.
How to get us through.

974
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:02,394
Battlefield doctors decide
who lives and dies,

975
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,022
it's called triage.

976
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,499
You kept calling it murder
when I did it.

977
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:09,935
Either way,
I figure it's something
you can grab onto.

978
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,297
Sacrifice play.

979
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:14,842
Hack up a body, leave it
at the start of the canyon

980
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,775
like a bucket of bait.

981
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:18,869
Trawl with it.

982
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,642
We got extra
cable on the sled.

983
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,109
We drag the body
40, 50 feet behind us.

984
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,174
Nice embellishment.

985
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:25,617
Well, I don't wanna feed 'em.

986
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,211
I just wanna keep 'em
off our scent.

987
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:28,722
So, which one
caught your eye?

988
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,189
No, no, don't look.

989
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,692
Christ. What the hell's
wrong with you?

990
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,424
Imam, slow down.

991
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:40,668
Just a little
more space between us
and them.

992
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,532
All right,
enough of this shit.

993
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:47,167
You do the girl, and I'll keep
the others off your back.

994
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,811
It's not too big a job
for you, is it?

995
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,415
I'm just wondering
if we don't need
a bigger piece of bait.

996
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,153
Like who?

997
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,558
Leave the sled!
Let's move!

998
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:14,897
[gun firing]

999
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,962
(Fry)
Let's go! Let's go!

1000
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,105
[both grunting]

1001
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,890
[creature hissing]

1002
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,340
One rule.

1003
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,082
Stay in the light.

1004
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,243
[both grunting]

1005
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,555
Remember that moment.

1006
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,031
[groaning]

1007
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,909
You should've never
taken the chains off, Johns.

1008
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,406
You were
one brave fuck before.

1009
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,281
You were really bad-ass.

1010
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:41,621
The chains.

1011
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,088
The gauge.

1012
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,826
The badge.

1013
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:53,132
I told you to ghost me.

1014
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,134
[creatures wailing]

1015
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,076

1019
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:41,637
[screams]

1020
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,478
Back to the ship, huh?

1021
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,251
Just huddle together
until the lights burn out.

1022
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,380
Get away from us.

1023
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:50,549
Till you can't see
what's eating you.

1024
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:51,985
That the big plan?

1025
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,287
Where's Johns?

1026
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:55,157
Which half?

1027
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,721
We're gonna lose
everybody out here.

1028
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,626
We should've stayed
at the ship.

1029
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,135
He died fast.

1030
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,568
If we have any choice
about it,

1031
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,538
that's the way
we should all go out.

1032
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,678
Don't you cry for Johns.

1033
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,005
Don't you dare.

1034
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,674
Blind spot.

1035
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,879
Shall we pray together?

1036
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,513
I have already prayed
with the others.

1037
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,384
It is painless.

1038
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:59,016
It's pointless.

1039
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,857
Because you do not
believe in God

1040
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,063
does not mean
God does not believe in you.

1041
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,793
Think someone can spend
half of their life in a slam

1042
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,836
with a horse bit
in their mouth
and not believe?

1043
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:11,599
Think he could start out
in some liquor store trash bin

1044
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:14,506
with an umbilical cord
wrapped around his neck

1045
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:16,168
and not believe?

1046
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,142
You got it all wrong,
holy man.

1047
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,643
I absolutely believe
in God.

1048
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:27,846
And I absolutely
hate the fucker.

1049
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,519
He is with us, nonetheless.

1050
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,924
2 of your boys
are already dead.

1051
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:36,458
How much faith
do you have left, Father?

1052
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:58,518
I only see one way.

1053
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,011
That way.

1054
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,851
It's the only way
off this rock.

1055
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:06,090
Just keep the girl
between you.

1056
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,320
What about the cells?

1057
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,297
I'll take those.

1058
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,233
Move.

1059
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:22,807
Are you sure
you can keep up?

1060
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:24,071
Move!

1061
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,374
[creatures squealing]

[gasps]

1063
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,183
Do not look up!

1064
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,852
Do not look up!

1065
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:14,827
They're killing
each other.

1066
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,113
(Riddick)
Move! Keep moving!

1067
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,889
Keep moving!

1068
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,734
[yelling]

01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,442

1071
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,955
Riddick! Wait!

1072
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,289
Riddick!

1073
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:38,167

1074
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:41,748
[screaming]

1075
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,259
Get off her!

1076
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:06,799
Get off her!

1077
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:13,736
[yelling]

1078
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:16,742
(Fry)
It's ok.

1079
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,424
[grunting]

1080
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:32,162
[creatures squealing]

1081
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:49,582
He did not know
who he was fucking with.

1082
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,349
[creatures wailing]

1083
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,399
(Fry)
Pull him up.

1084
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:10,434
Come on.
Pull him up.

1085
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:11,563
Stand up.

1086
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,266
Get up. Come on.

1087
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,646
Oh, no.

1088
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:32,152
[Riddick laughing]

1089
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:38,988
So, where the hell's
your God now?

1090
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,053
[groaning]

1091
01:31:04,225 --> 01:31:05,214
Riddick!

1092
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:08,725
Are we close?

1093
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,996
Just tell me
that the settlement
is right there.

1094
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,206
We can't make it.

1095
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,140
[yelling in Arabic]

1096
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:36,116
[creature hissing]

1097
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,161
Hide here! Now!

1098
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,315
Why is he
still out there?

1099
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,884
He's not coming back,
is he?

1100
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:13,685
[scratching]

1101
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:25,225
[creature wailing]

1102
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:28,925
[whirring]

1103
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,418
That's the last
I could find.

1104
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,556
[thudding]

1105
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:08,553
Strong survival instinct.

1106
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,589
I admire that
in a woman.

1107
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:13,189
I promised them

1108
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:16,162
that we would go back
with more light.

1109
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:17,534
Did you?

1110
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:19,728
Hmm.

1111
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:22,533
What, are you afraid?

1112
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:24,367
[laughing]

1113
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,810
Me, afraid?

1114
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:30,710
Come on, Riddick.

1115
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,309
There's gotta be
some part of you

1116
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:34,217
that wants to rejoin
the human race.

1117
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,583
Truthfully,
I wouldn't know how.

1118
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:41,027
Well, then just give me
more light for them.

1119
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:42,460
I'll go back by myself.

1120
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:43,654
Ok.

1121
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:49,635
There you go.

1122
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,202
Please just come with me.

1123
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,238
I got a better idea.

1124
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,811
Come with me.

1125
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:07,750
You're fucking with me,
I know you are.

1126
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,346
You know I am?

1127
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,486
You don't know
anything about me.

1128
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,295
I will leave you here.

1129
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:21,000
Step inside.

1130
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:26,300
I can't.

1131
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:27,497
Sure you can.

1132
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:28,599
I can't.

1133
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:30,906
Here, I'll make it easy
on you.

1134
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:33,470
Take my hand.

1135
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:35,211
Come on.

1136
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:37,211
Come on.

1137
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:38,709
[crying]

1138
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:41,254
Look, no one's
gonna blame you.

1139
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,084
Save yourself, Carolyn.

1140
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:47,758
Come on.

1141
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:50,294
Come on.

1142
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:56,160
That's it.
That's it.

1143
01:37:58,138 --> 01:37:59,469
Good girl.

1144
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,002
[creature wailing]

1145
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:16,622
[screaming]

1146
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:21,021
You listen to me!

1147
01:38:21,495 --> 01:38:23,793
I am the captain
of this ship

1148
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:26,428
and I am not leaving
anyone on this rock

1149
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,524
with those
fucking things,

1150
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:29,034
even if it means...

1151
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:30,502
[grunting]

1152
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:34,606
Get that thing
off my neck.

1153
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:35,733
Shut up!

1154
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:38,568
You'd die for them?

1155
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:40,509
I would try for them.

1156
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:43,175
You didn't answer me.

1157
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,816
Yes, I would, Riddick.

1158
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:47,984
I would.

1159
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:50,019
I would die for them.

1160
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:57,921
How interesting.

1161
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:00,698
[thudding]

1162
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:20,114
Never had a doubt.

1163
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:22,955
Anyone not ready
for this?

1164
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:24,820
There is my God,
Mr. Riddick.

1165
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,599
[screeching]

[screeching]

1168
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,201
Don't stop. Don't stop!

1169
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,442
Come on! Move! Move!

1170
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:24,916
You know the way!

1171
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:48,836
On board!
Come on! Get on!

1172
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:34,943
[wailing]

1173
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:46,093
Carolyn.

1174
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:52,964
Come.

1175
01:41:55,742 --> 01:41:56,800
Now.

1176
01:42:04,551 --> 01:42:05,609
[Riddick yelling]

1177
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:07,119
Wait.

1178
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:16,184
Riddick.

1179
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:22,429
Riddick.

1180
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:25,961
[gasps]

1181
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,008
[panting]

1182
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:38,647
Ok, hold onto me.
Hold onto me.

1183
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,209
We're gonna get out of here.

1184
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:41,720
I got you. Come on.

1185
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:46,117
Come on, Riddick!
Get up! Get up!

1186
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:47,924
Get up!

1187
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:51,827
I said I'd die
for them, not you.

1188
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:54,231
Let's move.
Come on. Come on.

1189
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:56,791
All right.

1190
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:00,195
[gasps]

1191
01:43:31,638 --> 01:43:33,003
Not for me.

1192
01:43:35,008 --> 01:43:36,373
Not for me!

1193
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:50,288
With so much prayer
to make up for,

1194
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:52,854
I scarcely know
where to begin.

1195
01:43:54,361 --> 01:43:56,261
I know where I'd start.

1196
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:24,983
Riddick, what are you doing?

1197
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:40,804
[clanging]

1198
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:53,381
Can we just get the hell
out of here now?

1199
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:55,154
We can't leave

1200
01:44:55,322 --> 01:44:56,311
[gasps]

1201
01:44:59,693 --> 01:45:01,490
without saying good night.

1202
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:04,794
[creatures screeching]

1203
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,756
A lot of questions,
whoever we run into.

1204
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,188
Could even be a merc ship.

1205
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:43,736
So, what the hell
do we tell them about you?

1206
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,139
Tell 'em Riddick's dead.

1207
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:52,441
He died somewhere
on that planet.

1208
01:46:13,644 --> 01:46:15,441
THE END
