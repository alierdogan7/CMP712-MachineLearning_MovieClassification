Is that a deal?

train to go to the costume party.

518
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,440
(CLEARS THROAT)

519
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,030
Pop Pop, I think you're
mixing up something.

520
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,281
Huh?

521
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,995
Oh, man.

522
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,997
Oh, man. What a...

523
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,625
What a bunch of
confused old fools

524
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,293
your grandparents
turned out to be.

525
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,379
That's all right.
It's okay.

526
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,505
(SIGHS)

527
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,173
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.

528
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,467
Okay?
(SNIFFS) Okay. Yeah.

529
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,552
It's okay.
Right. Yeah.

530
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,303
NANA: <i>Good morning,
Cecil B. DeMille.</i>

531
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,974
He was a great director.

532
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,268
I made you
cheddar biscuits, dear.

533
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,274
Was the old coot getting ready for
the costume party again?

534
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,401
BECCA: Yeah, he was.

535
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,736
He's crazy.

536
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,448
I'm just doing some chores in the barn.
I'll be in in a minute.

537
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,328
Something happened
to your computer.

538
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,291
I spilled some
biscuit batter on it.

539
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,751
I tried to clean it
with cleaner.

540
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,587
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,008
TYLER: <i>She's weird
during the day,</i>

542
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,759
and then gets even
weirder at night?

543
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm telling you it's okay.

544
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,888
I downloaded the definition
of "Sundowning."

545
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,265
You wouldn't
understand half the words

546
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,267
I'm reading.
The word "YOLO" isn't in it.

547
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,269
It's got to do with
neurological reactions

548
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,937
to sunshine and moonlight.

549
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,523
It's literally
a chemical reaction.

550
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,068
"Sundown Syndrome: a term
for disorientation, agitation,

551
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,862
"a general worsening
of mental symptoms,

552
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,948
"classically described
in the elderly at dusk or nightfall."

553
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,118
It's normal
old-age problems.

554
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,078
People are scared
of old people for no reason.

555
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,622
What about the computer?

556
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,707
The only thing messed up
is the computer camera.

557
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,292
There's something else
going on.

558
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,127
She used oven cleaner,

559
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,672
and now the tiny camera
on the screen doesn't see anything.

560
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,799
You don't find
that odd at all?

561
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,217
She made a mistake.

562
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:51,721
Just come to accept they're old people
and things won't be as weird.

563
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,466
MOM: <i>We're on the upper deck.</i>

I can't see you.</i>

568
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,152
(SIGHS) I think
I can clean it off.

<i>Tyler, why are you quiet?</i>

570
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,701
Nana and Pop Pop
are acting strange. Ow!

571
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,455
<i>What kind of strange?
Becca, did you hit Tyler?</i>

572
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,915
No.

<i>Kids?</i>

574
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,255
Pop Pop wears diapers
and he keeps them in an outhouse,

575
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:27,840
and Nana walks around
at night without her clothes,

576
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,927
and Pop Pop thinks
strangers are following him.

577
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:35,348
(EXHALES) <i>I knew we were gonna have this call.
They're old, Tyler.</i>

578
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,974

581
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,357
<i>Becca, how strange
are they acting?</i>

582
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,526
They haven't been
mean one second.

583
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,985
Nana crawled after us
under the house.

584
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,195
Playing hide-and-seek.

585
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,406
<i>You guys played hide-and-seek

<i>My parents were strange back then.
Mom was a hippie.</i>

589
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,288
<i>She used to sunbathe in the
back yard without warning back then.</i>

Where did you
first meet Pop Pop?

In a garden.

think of him?

out tonight. Okay?

It's like we're living
with a werewolf.

won't understand this

isn't fully developed yet,

Why?

00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,515
It's exploitative.
I have cinematic standards.

would indicate.

690
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,735
Oh. Oh!

691
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:10,446
I forgot I had
something for you.

692
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:21,332
When you think of Dad now,
in California, do you still like him?

693
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,002
I don't know.
Stuff happens.

694
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,713
No, but Dad is hilarious.
Dad's funny.

695
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:31,091
He sent the funny card
of the fat lady on the boardwalk. (LAUGHS)

696
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,927
Do you remember that?

697
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,137
What do you mean
"stuff happens"?

698
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,183
People leave.

699
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:43,646
Because they find something
they like better.

700
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,898
So you don't feel bad?

701
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:48,442
No.

702
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,321
You're not being truthful.

703
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:56,992
Well, you can believe what you want,
but this is how I feel.

704
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,912
Make me believe you.

705
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:09,463
So, I'm on the Titans pee wee
football team and it was third down.

706
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,299
It was at the end
and we were leading.

707
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,343
So if we stop them,
we probably win the game.

708
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,137
Give me context.
How old are you?

709
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,973
I'm eight.

710
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,643
So, I'm free safety.

711
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,937
Which means that
I'm supposed to tackle the guy

712
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,274
if he makes it past
the people on the line.

713
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:29,942
So, their running
back punches the hole... Okay.

714
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,069
Am I supposed to be
following these terms?

715
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:34,405
Are these phrases supposed
to mean something to me?

716
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,948
Just listen.

717
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:40,869
So their running back,
who's big, makes it past the line,

718
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:43,622
and I'm the only one
left to tackle him.

719
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:44,748
All I got to do
is tackle him,

720
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:47,251
put my hands around him
and tackle him, but...

721
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,547
I just stand there.

722
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:56,302
They call it "freezing"
and I could hear everyone yelling.

723
00:43:56,385 --> 00:44:00,347
Coach Daugherty, Dad.
All my teammates, and...

724
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,517
He gets the first down
and runs and runs,

725
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,563
and the other team is celebrating,
and I'm still standing there.

726
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,735
Same place.

727
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,282
Then the assistant coach
came and got me,

728
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,492
and Dad patted me on the shoulder
and then went to the car,

729
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:24,246
and he never told me
he was angry or anything.

730
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,709
You think Dad didn't
say anything and left

731
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,587
because you didn't tackle another
eight-year-old in a game

732
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:33,380
five years ago?

733
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,763
When you say it like that,
it sounds stupid.

It's only water.

Okay, fine.

you don't like looking at yourself.

You never look at
yourself in the mirror.

754
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:07,975

you don't look at yourself,

or are you gonna
keep lying?

00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:57,900

I started doing that?

down in the basement.

It's just me and my brother here.

were counselors at Meadowbrook.

I was in

no tissues left, Becca.

spit into the water all day long.

Their spit can make
you sleep, but not die.

When people go
underwater in the pond,

957

they go into
a deep sleep.
