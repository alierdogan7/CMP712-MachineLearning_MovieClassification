1
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,788
You know that evil Heavy Metal

2
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,891
that your parents hate
you listening to?

3
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:34,927
You know those lyrics
about hell and doom,

4
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,530
demons ripping you
new orifices to shit out of?

5
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:42,200
But what if I told you
it's all reel?

6
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:45,135
I know...

7
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:49,606
I was there.

8
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:28,174
But wait...
lets start at the beginning.

9
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:31,676
It all started in Greypoint,

10
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:34,678
the middle of ass-fuck nowhere.

11
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,346
I had to shift here
after my mum

12
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,281
went on a massive meth bender,

13
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:41,049
and tried to suck off
a Santa Claus

14
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:43,283
in a crowded mall.

15
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:47,252
Mum got sent to a mental ward.

16
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:49,087
And I got stuck with my Uncle.

17
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:05,335
My Uncle Albert
was balls deep into Jesus.

18
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:11,005
He thought Ricky Martin
was heavy.

19
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,240
He heard me cranking some
Disemboweled Corpse,

20
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,975
and he hasn't slept for days.

21
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:21,012
I brought about
the end of the world.

22
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:22,747
Biggest dick move ever.

23
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:24,982
- Stop struggling.
- Ow.

24
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:26,950
- It won't fit.
- Ow. Ow.

25
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,952
- Get up there. Oh...
- This is Dion.

26
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:31,220
And that is probably the least
embarrassing orifice

27
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:33,889
that dice has been shoved into.

28
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:36,124
Wait... Yes, it's in!

29
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,159
And this is my dickhead cousin.

30
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:42,129
He's hospitalized
more nerds than asthma.

31
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,131
I saw Uncle Albert washing
your sheets this morning.

32
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,333
You shit the bed or something?

33
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,233
Fuckin' devil-worshiper.

34
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,134
I can't wait until my dad
kicks you out on the streets

35
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,236
and you've got to blow
truck drivers for food

36
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,270
like your psycho mum.

37
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,372
His Mum is a psycho.

38
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:57,673
Ow.

39
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,911
You all right, man?

40
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,379
Here's your dice.

41
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,281
It's actually die.
Dice is plural.

42
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:11,816
Um, and it's a D10. But...

43
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,286
Thanks.

44
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,421
Jesus. Who's that?

45
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,823
Oh, Medina Darcy.

46
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:23,225
Number one cause
of awkward boners in Greypoint.

47
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:26,861
Ah... no dude.

48
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,896
What do you mean "no"?

49
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:32,165
Chicks like that, they don't
go out with metalheads.

50
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,300
They bang apes
like your cousin.

51
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:37,235
Forget her man.

52
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:39,170
At lunchtime,

53
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:45,276
do you want to do something
completely badass?

54
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:53,749
And that's...

55
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:55,350
eight points
of non-lethal damage.

56
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:58,186
Exceeds your HP;
Your cleric is unconscious.

57
00:03:58,188 --> 00:03:59,921
No fucking way.

58
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,390
How is it still breathing?
I cast a fireball.

59
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:05,192
You cast it at a Fire troll.

60
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,027
It's immune to fire.

61
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,795
This is bullshit.

62
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:09,929
Well, that's Giles.

63
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:13,432
For violating the
CPR training dummy.

64
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:14,866
I'm the DM, Giles.

65
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,301
What I say goes, okay?
I am the law.

66
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,770
Ah, now this -
this is problem, Dion.

67
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,172
This is why no woman
will - will talk to you.

68
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,239
Hey, do you know what?

69
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:24,807
A whole family of goblins

70
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:26,809
has just amassed around
your dead boy.

71
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,343
And one of them
is humping your foot.

72
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:29,077
How do you like that?

73
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,378
How how...

74
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,758
Ah!

75
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:51,093
Hey.

76
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,127
Fuckin' nerds.

77
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,762
Oh Jesus.

78
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,732
It's piss.

79
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:02,001
They - they sprayed us
with piss.

80
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,202
Again!

81
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:06,939
Oh, the Player's Guide
is totally ruined.

82
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,909
My uncle keeps trying
to christen me in my sleep,

83
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,344
and I'm drenched in my
cousin's bodily fluids.

84
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,246
X minus one...

85
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:20,316
X plus one...

86
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:26,821
Good work, Brodie.

87
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,989
Nice technique.

88
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:32,192
Great shading on the
demon penises.

89
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:33,092
Ah.

90
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:35,494
Ha, is that me
having hot pokers

91
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:37,195
stuffed up my rectum
by skeletons?

92
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:37,862
Yes, sir.

93
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:40,097
Mmm. Nice likeness.

94
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,498
Very detailed.

95
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,966
Two weeks detention.

96
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:50,438
Silence!

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,807
So, that's me. Brodie.

98
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:54,508
Thus, X 6, X 5...

99
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,909
Fuck my life.

100
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,181
Fucking late again.

101
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:11,154
Oh Christ, it's my
Satanist cousin, Brodie.

102
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,289
Look at that ugly loner.

103
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,857
I'm gonna make his life
hell on earth.

104
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,525
Wow. That's really cool, David.

105
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,327
Can you please
take me home now?

106
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,295
I thought we'd take
a drive or something.

107
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:27,434
But talking about bullying
isn't really a turn on.

108
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,871
There was only one
cool thing about Greypoint...

109
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:33,539
Alien Records.

110
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,407
Byron sold the sickest vinyl,

111
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,108
while his psychic girlfriend,
Abigail,

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,043
told fortunes to
bored housewives.

113
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,445
Welcome, to Alien records.

114
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:46,114
How are things, kid?

115
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,815
Things are shitty.

116
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,917
Check it out.

117
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,952
Oh, Haxan Sword? Epic.

118
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:57,021
It's only one of
666 ever printed;

119
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,958
Numbered in blood
by Rikki Daggers himself.

120
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,595
Metal vinyl is over there
by that kid.

121
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,163
Fuck, yes.

122
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,664
Now that's a record, man.

123
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,265
Yeah.

124
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,567
I've actually been after
that one for a while.

125
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,403
I'm Brodie by the way.

126
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:01,443
After I met Zakk,
my life changed.

127
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:04,512
My mother was gonna
call me Storm though.

128
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:05,713
Rad.

129
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:08,082
I know.

130
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:09,616
He was a tornado of chaos,

131
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:11,517
leaving, ah,
a trail of destruction

132
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,153
and teen pregnancies
in his wake.

133
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,521
Zakk got expelled after

134
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:18,189
stabbing a kid
with a math compass

135
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:21,225
because he stepped on his
King Diamond tape.

136
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:24,094
Or was it a setsquare?

137
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:26,462
He used to help his
Dad at the car workshop.

138
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,631
But mainly he just stole
anything not bolted on

139
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,566
and then unbolted the rest.

140
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:34,568
Yeah. Fuck you too, Bono.

141
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:38,638
Hey man...

142
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,073
you want to do something crazy?

143
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:43,442
It's not role-playing is it?

144
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:46,477
What the fuck is role-playing?

145
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,756
Zakk played bass

146
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:05,159
so we started a band.

147
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,326
Hey.

148
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:07,794
This is, ah, Giles and Dion.

149
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:10,296
- Hey.
- Hey.

150
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:16,067
Right, first things first.

151
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,168
What are we called?

152
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,236
Um... Murder Boner?

153
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,104
Toothed Vagina.

154
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:23,239
Oh, Maggot Sperm.

155
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:24,640
Cannibal Unicorn.

156
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,575
How about like, thirteen S's.

157
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:30,278
You know, like?

158
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Got it. Got it.

159
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:33,614
DEATHGASM.

160
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,148
All spelled in capitals.

161
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,216
Lower case is for pussies.

162
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,151
Cool. What about...

163
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,620
I fuckin' said...

164
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,090
DEATHGASM!

165
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:59,469
Solo. Fuckin' shred it.

166
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,116
Dude, I thought you said
you could play.

167
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,250
Sorry.

168
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:17,851
Ah... I can. I can.

169
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:20,553
I'm just - I'm -
I'm just rusty.

170
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,422
All right. From the top.

171
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:35,697
What? Just mixing it up.

172
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:43,802
Where are we going?

173
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:46,171
It's a surprise.

174
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:54,678
Dude, chill out. It's fine.

175
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:04,286
All right. You stay here.

176
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,427
You're lookout.

177
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,195
What?

178
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:26,537
Shit.

179
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,676
Zakk?

180
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:30,830
Zakk?

181
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,432
Oh shit!

182
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:37,202
Did you shit yourself?

183
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:42,406
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're an accomplice, mate.

184
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,875
Don't puss out on me now.
Come on.

185
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,210
Check it out.

186
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:50,580
Oh shit.

187
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:53,382
Man, these guys were legends
back in the day.

188
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:54,783
Check it out.

189
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:56,484
Oh.

190
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,285
Rikki Daggers.

191
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,687
Didn't he used to kill
live rabbits on stage

192
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,855
with a crowbar?

193
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:05,924
No, man. It was a claw hammer.

194
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:10,227
Wonder what happened to him?

195
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:11,561
Spent all his money on coke,

196
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:14,230
hookers and Satanist shit.

197
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,732
Last I heard he was
hiding out in some small,

198
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,768
crappy New Zealand town.

199
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,405
No fuckin' way.

200
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,707
Yes fuckin' way.

201
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,642
No fuckin' way.

202
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:31,645
Rikki Fuckin' Daggers, man.

203
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:35,849
Shh. Hey, this way.

204
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,292
Holy fuck. Look at those amps.

205
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:50,662
No, they're old as hell;
Probably all busted.

206
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,265
Is that...?

207
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,033
It's him.

208
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,367
Is he dead?

209
00:13:58,369 --> 00:13:59,534
I bags that record.

210
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:00,935
Dude, that's low.

211
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:03,737
I can go much lower.

212
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,911
Shh.

213
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,472
Come on.

214
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:47,508
- Check it out.
- No fuckin' way.

215
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,942
Motherfucker!

216
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:50,710
- Whoa!
- Dude. Dude. Dude.

217
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:54,113
- Dude...
- The record... drop it.

218
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:56,782
Kick it to me.

219
00:14:56,784 --> 00:15:00,018
Right. What the fuck.

220
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,754
- Chill.
- Are you two cunts...

221
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:04,822
doing in my house?!

222
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:05,756
Let's get out of here. Come on.

223
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,858
Don't you fuckin' move.

224
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Aeon sent you, didn't he?

225
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:14,464
When are you occultist cunts

226
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:15,965
ever gonna fuckin learn?

227
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,400
No, we're just - we're just
metalheads.

228
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:20,602
We're fans.

229
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:24,405
Well, how did you find me?

230
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,373
Latest Death Scream, dude.

231
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,574
You were outed.

232
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:28,975
Oh fuck.

233
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,878
Fuck!

234
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,849
We're all gonna die.

235
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,066
Shit. Someone is coming.

236
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,372
Here. Take it.

237
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:04,606
Take it!

238
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,809
Hide it and guard it
with your life.

239
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:08,476
Come on, let's bail.

240
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:10,678
- Let's bail.
- Fuck.

241
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:24,590
So you fuckers
finally found me.

242
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,425
Where is it, Daggers?

243
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:40,469
Who were you talking to?

244
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:41,636
I heard voices.

245
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,571
Why don't you go home

246
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:46,674
and tell Aeon to fuck himself!

247
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,679
It's a trap.

248
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:58,684
Well go on then, do it,
you fuckin' pussy.

249
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,269
Well, that was fucked up.

250
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,040
Dude, what the hell?

251
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,976
It's a fucking
Rick Astley record!

252
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,611
Fuck.

253
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:35,247
What the hell was that?

254
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:37,582
Weird.

255
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:41,118
It's music.

256
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,055
Yeah, I think so.
It's pretty universal.

257
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:48,190
It's really old.

258
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,992
Holy fuck.

259
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:52,326
Look at the title.

260
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:53,860
What the fuck does it say?

261
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:55,595
Don't know, I think it's Latin.

262
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:57,630
What, like,
Dora the fuckin' Explorer?

263
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:00,666
No. Like, like,
Romans and shit.

264
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,668
Dude... We should learn this;

265
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,603
Turn it into a DEATHGASM song!

266
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,272
It'll be fuckin' brutal.

267
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:08,940
You want a beer?

268
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,275
Ah, yeah.

269
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,296
Vadin.

270
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,366
- I found Daggers.
- Straight to it?

271
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,302
Not even a,
"How are things, Aeon?"

272
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,371
I've always liked
that about you.

273
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,206
Aeon, the pages.

274
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,608
The Black Hymn, Vadin.

275
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,276
Pages are just paper.

276
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:53,044
The Black Hymn
is absolute power.

277
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:56,280
Please, give it the
reverence it deserves.

278
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:59,249
Daggers didn't have it,
The Black Hymn.

279
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,851
I think someone
got to it before us.

280
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,953
Oh.

281
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:06,388
That's a shame.

282
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,023
There was a break in.

283
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:11,792
The pages should be
in Greypoint somewhere.

284
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:13,693
I just need more time.

285
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:23,868
Winners don't make excuses
for their failures, Vadin.

286
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,302
They learn from them.

287
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:26,803
No. Please.

288
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:28,671
Take his fucking head off.

289
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:29,872
No!

290
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:36,710
That's a custom made
Sartori rug, idiots.

291
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:39,913
You put a tarp down first.

292
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,914
Do it again.

293
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,883
Again!

294
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:48,119
Do it again!

295
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,669
That's good.

296
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,037
Yeah, I think that worked.

297
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,141
Get the car;

298
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:15,209
We're heading into Greypoint.

299
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,053
Zakk - Zakk, that's good.

300
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:28,287
Um, Brodie,

301
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:32,190
can - can you put your
foot up on that tree?

302
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,392
Yeah. But - but higher?

303
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:36,292
Higher.

304
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:39,161
Our - our instruments
aren't even plugged in.

305
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:40,929
Where the fuck is the sound
meant to be coming from?

306
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:44,832
This is gonna be off the hook.

307
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:45,866
Yeah, yeah. No, that's good.

308
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:50,070
Um, let's - let's head
to the next location.

309
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:58,310
Fuck you, Dion.

310
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,485
Does anybody want
anything from the shop?

311
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:43,986
Condoms, vaseline,

312
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:45,988
jumper cables
and ammonium nitrate.

313
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,291
I don't think they sell
that combination of things.

314
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,992
See... Oh!

315
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:52,226
Sorry.

316
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,327
Sorry.

317
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,363
There you go.

318
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:02,333
Could I please have my tampon?

319
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:03,834
Yeah sure.

320
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,902
Thanks.

321
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,503
You're Brodie, right?

322
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,104
Yeah.

323
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:11,773
I'm Medina, from maths class.

324
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:15,076
Right, you're David's
girlfriend, right?

325
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,912
You know what,
I was gonna get an ice cream.

326
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:19,780
Did you want one?

327
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:25,252
Ah, yeah. I was just
helping these guys, um...

328
00:22:26,254 --> 00:22:28,088
Ah, we're - we're
all done here,

329
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,058
dude, ah, catch you later.

330
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,259
Yeah, that'd be great.

331
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:35,326
Cool.

332
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,464
Sperminate her, dude!

333
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:02,418
So, um, the other day,
in maths...

334
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,255
ah, Mr. Capenhurst
is such a dick.

335
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:08,423
- Yeah.
- Yep.

336
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:09,891
I, um, I saved this.

337
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:13,461
Well,
I rescued it from the bin.

338
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:15,529
You're a really good drawer,
like, really talented.

339
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,197
I wish I could draw like that.

340
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,398
Okay.

341
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,334
Thank you. Thanks.

342
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,039
I was thinking about
getting a tattoo

343
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,840
it would drive my dad crazy.

344
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,410
I should get you to design it.

345
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:37,112
Maybe that's lame.

346
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:40,315
I mean, of course
I would help you design it.

347
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:42,617
Not "of course
I think it's lame".

348
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,454
Okay.

349
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:50,524
You know, I was thinking
about getting it just, um...

350
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,893
just here.

351
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:56,529
Yes... good spot for it.

352
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:59,331
Or or maybe here,
on my upper thigh.

353
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,399
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yeah.

354
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:05,035
Either - I mean, again,
both great areas - places.

355
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:08,004
And hard decision.

356
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,473
So...

357
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,043
So, you're in a band?

358
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,111
Yeah, I, um, I play,
ah, the guitar.

359
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:19,346
I mean, axe.

360
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:22,949
Um, do you, do you like metal?

361
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:27,519
Um, isn't it just a bunch
of guys screaming?

362
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:29,354
No way.

363
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:32,457
Well, apart from grindcore.

364
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:36,060
And... death metal
is kind of like that.

365
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:38,929
And deathcore, screamo,
pornogrind,

366
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,597
black metal, mathcore,
thrash and mordorcore.

367
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,398
- But apart from those.
- Mmm.

368
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,566
It's just not my thing.

369
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,034
I don't really get it.

370
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:51,137
It's like, when life sucks,

371
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:54,039
and - and you feel alone
and empty.

372
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,075
You stick on some metal
and life is better, because -

373
00:24:57,077 --> 00:25:00,111
because somebody else
knows the pain and -

374
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:04,048
and the rage that you're
going through, you know?

375
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:15,090
Um, I'll - I'll -
I'll lend you a CD.

376
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,091
You should - you should
have a - have a listen.

377
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:19,059
Ah...

378
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:22,995
Oh.

379
00:25:29,133 --> 00:25:30,399
Ah, anal cunt.

380
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,200
Ah, ah...

381
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:33,134
This one.

382
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,078
Awesome.

383
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,547
Ah, these are really,
really old.

384
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,448
How are they not in a museum?

385
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,417
Where did you say you
got these again, dude?

386
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,186
- I, um...
- Found them...

387
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,689
in a skip.

388
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:28,246
I'm warning you, Brodie.

389
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:30,714
Stop that devil music now.

390
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:42,280
Shit, man.

391
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,723
Laters, bud.

392
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:56,825
Dude, you choked again.

393
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:59,893
Sorry, I, ah,
started panicking.

394
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:01,360
You ever had that feeling

395
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:02,794
where you can't breathe?

396
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:04,362
Like there's a crushing
weight on your chest,

397
00:28:04,364 --> 00:28:06,297
and the room gets really small

398
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,899
and your heart starts
beating insanely fast?

399
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:11,468
No, never had that.

400
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,369
Oh, although this one time,

401
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:14,603
this chick grabbed
my nuts too hard,

402
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:17,238
and my splooge came out red.

403
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:21,541
Brotherhood of Steel?

404
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,843
Brotherhood of Steel.

405
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:26,245
Laters.

406
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:21,996
Whoa.

407
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,968
The expression

408
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:38,575
three A plus two B over two.

409
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:45,280
When A equals three

410
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:51,919
and B equals four.

411
00:29:54,856 --> 00:30:01,928
Anyway, three A
plus two B equals two.

412
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:08,734
Then A equals three.

413
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:16,507
B equals four.

414
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:22,012
Hey, cuz.

415
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:24,380
The fuck do you want?

416
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,549
Fuck.

417
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:29,883
Get him.

418
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:33,552
What are you gonna do
about it, fudge packer?

419
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:34,719
Tell my dad?

420
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:35,886
He hates you too.

421
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:36,920
Fuck.

422
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,721
You go near my bitch again

423
00:30:38,723 --> 00:30:40,522
and I'll punch you in the
dick every morning.

424
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:41,789
Fucktard.

425
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,791
Rip Brodie's girlie
earring out.

426
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:44,925
No.

427
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:48,694
No! No, no, no...

428
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,190
Come on. Lay into him.

429
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,418
Are you stealing petrol?

430
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,621
No. I'm stealing diesel.

431
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:23,356
Well, don't you feel guilty?

432
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:27,725
No. Hold that.

433
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:31,695
You're Zakk right?
Brodie's friend?

434
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:32,829
He - do you know where he is?

435
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:35,431
He skipped class
this afternoon.

436
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,800
Brodie?

437
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:40,402
Oh yeah. He lost his dick in
a freak bandsaw accident.

438
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:42,704
Tragic.

439
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:43,938
Okay...

440
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:49,042
Um... Well...

441
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,613
Can you give him this?

442
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:55,780
Oh.

443
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,415
Don't read it.

444
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:56,067
Zakk?

445
00:32:56,069 --> 00:32:58,669
Where's Brodie?

446
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:01,437
He told me to
pass on a message.

447
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:03,872
He's not interested.

448
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:06,407
He's got other shit going on.

449
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:11,978
Oh.

450
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,947
Well that's shit.

451
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,648
Yeah...

452
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,983
well, I thought I'd
come down and tell you.

453
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:22,719
Save up waiting all night,
freezing your tits off, eh?

454
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:27,923
Thank you for considering
the well-being of my tits.

455
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:30,592
You're welcome.

456
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:32,826
Here.

457
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:35,694
You're freezing.

458
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:45,568
Swig?

459
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,103
Helps take the bullshit away.

460
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:53,707
Fuck it.

461
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,077
His mum is a psycho...

462
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:15,849
Are you gonna tell us
who gave you the shiner?

463
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:16,850
Won't matter soon.

464
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:19,018
Let's just fuckin' do this.

465
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,753
Dude, you know
I have your back.

466
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:22,821
Tell me who they are,
I'll fuck them up.

467
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:25,023
I'm fine.

468
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:26,624
All right. Well, if they
give you anymore shit,

469
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,058
I know a trick, all right?

470
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,627
"Ooh gross,
your cock is hanging out."

471
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,862
And then when they
look down... Boom!

472
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,298
You punch them in the face.

473
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,901
My dad taught me that.

474
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:41,802
All right, ladies.
From the top.

475
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:31,071
Goddamn,
I have the worst headache.

476
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:32,505
Were we asleep?

477
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,743
Amps are buggered.

478
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:41,845
Guys...

479
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,413
Guys, do I look different?

480
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:47,016
More, like more powerful?

481
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,289
You could be
weaker than before.

482
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,823
Something fucked up happened.

483
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,491
Man, my head is throbbing.

484
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:03,261
Something went wrong.

485
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:05,429
It didn't work.

486
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:09,299
What are you
talking about, Dude?

487
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,770
Wouldn't it be crazy if -

488
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:18,039
if the music had something
to do with demons?

489
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,007
Demons?

490
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:22,809
Demons?

491
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:26,946
Demons? What?

492
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,526
Fuck!

493
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:46,160
What do you want, asshole?

494
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:48,362
Can you hear the trumpets,
Brodie?

495
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:50,097
They're getting louder.

496
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,432
The Blind One is coming.

497
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:54,333
He's going to suck out
your intestines

498
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:59,237
and use your ribs
as toothpicks.

499
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,040
Um... okay.

500
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,312
Did I mention

501
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,248
he's going to roast your
nuts over an open fire?

502
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,416
While they are still attached,
of course.

503
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,418
Ah. No, Terry.
You didn't mention that.

504
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,119
Well he is.

505
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:52,313
Mr. Capenhurst, are you okay?

506
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:10,627
Oh my God.

507
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:18,166
Oh my God.

508
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:26,906
There was just
blood everywhere,

509
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:28,574
from every hole.

510
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:30,075
It was crazy.

511
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:31,409
Weird.

512
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:33,210
Yeah, it was mental, man.

513
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:37,880
Medina, too. Just -
just totally ignored me.

514
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:40,048
Did she say why?

515
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,916
No.

516
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:43,183
Feels like everybody
in my neighborhood

517
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:45,919
has gone insane.

518
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:49,022
This town has always
been fuckin' crazy.

519
00:40:49,024 --> 00:40:51,591
Pouring fuckin' fluoride in
the water or something.

520
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,027
What the fuck is that noise?

521
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:58,330
Dad?

522
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:03,033
For fuck's sake.

523
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:07,103
Dad?

524
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,605
Dad?

525
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:15,009
Dad, what the fuck
are you doing?

526
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,343
Dad?

527
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:18,211
What are you doing?

528
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:20,246
What's wrong with him,
is he drunk?

529
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:21,480
I don't think so.

530
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:23,181
Dad, talk to me.

531
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:25,283
Look, I want to take this
T-shirt off your face.

532
00:41:25,285 --> 00:41:26,584
Yeah?

533
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:29,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. It's okay.

534
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,588
Fuck!

535
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,492
What the fuck is he doing?

536
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,461
- Holy fuck!
- Whoa!

537
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,163
I can see you.

538
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,197
Oh fuck!

539
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:28,503
Brutal.

540
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,072
Should we... check his pulse.

541
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:34,108
He has a fucking
engine for a head.

542
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,144
I don't think he's gonna be
walking this one off, man.

543
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:39,246
Shit.

544
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:44,116
Your Dad, I'm... Fuck.
I'm really sorry.

545
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,185
Fuck!

546
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:59,595
You know, it's weird but

547
00:42:59,597 --> 00:43:03,398
I think he would've
wanted to go out like this.

548
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,133
His eyes ripped out,
face grinded off,

549
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:08,768
and then head mounted
under a car engine?

550
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,370
Totally.

551
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:16,306
For whom the bell tolls,
old man.

552
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:20,142
Oh fuck.

553
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:22,144
Fuck!

554
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,346
Dude, dude, I am so sorry.

555
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,115
Fuck man. This is all my fault.

556
00:43:27,117 --> 00:43:30,017
Okay. Fuck.
I translated those pages,

557
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:31,418
and - and - and
they were to do with -

558
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,786
with summoning demons, okay?

559
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:34,788
And now people
are turning crazy.

560
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,157
Like, possessed crazy.

561
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,558
You knew that was
some black magic shit

562
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,159
and you didn't fuckin' tell me?

563
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,393
I didn't want you
to think I was crazy.

564
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:44,696
It's a bit fuckin' late now,
isn't it?

565
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:48,732
This is fucking twisted, man.

566
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:51,267
Fuckin' demons?

567
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:54,669
Abigail. Fuckin' Abigail.

568
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:56,437
You know, the - the chick from
the - from the record store,

569
00:43:56,439 --> 00:43:57,371
the psychic chick.

570
00:43:57,373 --> 00:43:58,705
She knows all about this stuff.

571
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:01,040
We should go see her.

572
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,528
The lights are on.
They could still be here.

573
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:38,471
Well, I'm out of ideas.

574
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,372
Jesus!

575
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:47,645
These things suck.

576
00:44:49,714 --> 00:44:52,548
What are you... hey!
What are you doing?

577
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:54,883
Who brings a dice purse

578
00:44:54,885 --> 00:44:57,852
to a demon apocalypse anyway?

579
00:45:08,262 --> 00:45:09,894
How do we stop these things?

580
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:12,429
Shit.

581
00:45:18,435 --> 00:45:19,968
- Medina!
- What's up?

582
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,437
- Sweet axe skills.
- Thanks.

583
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:24,405
I wanted to come up with,
like, one-liner like,

584
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:25,706
"you were axing for this,"
or something.

585
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:26,707
That would be really cool,
right?

586
00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:28,275
That was pretty cool as is.

587
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:30,977
I mean, the axe, and the...

588
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:32,211
Yeah.

589
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:34,346
Fuckin' awesome.

590
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:01,668
Abigail, we need to get
you to a hospital, okay?

591
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,370
It's too late.

592
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:08,339
It has possessed their bodies.

593
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,573
Whoa.

594
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:12,441
Is that Satan?

595
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:16,610
That is Aeloth
King of the demons.

596
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:17,877
Aeloth?

597
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:19,879
Sounds like a badass.

598
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:21,747
These words
were in music pages.

599
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:23,482
The Black Hymn.

600
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:25,383
You have it.

601
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:26,617
Have it?

602
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,319
We fuckin' played it.

603
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:40,294
Well, then you
have fucked us all.

604
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:52,972
The possessed bodies,
they kill all in their path

605
00:46:53,606 --> 00:46:57,008
in preparation for
Aeloth's ascension

606
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,410
on the next blood moon.

607
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,780
On the devil's hour.

608
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:08,883
Oh shit,
the moon is red tonight.

609
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:10,451
When is the Devil's hour?

610
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,752
Three AM.

611
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:15,921
Wait.

612
00:47:15,923 --> 00:47:19,057
Three AM Pacific
or Eastern time?

613
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:22,627
Do demons recognize
daylight savings?

614
00:47:22,629 --> 00:47:25,963
When Aeloth returns
His soul will fuse

615
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:28,966
with that of a darkest
human host.

616
00:47:28,968 --> 00:47:30,300
How can we stop him?

617
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,503
Do you still have
the Black Hymn?

618
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:34,570
Yeah, it's back at my Uncle's.

619
00:47:34,572 --> 00:47:35,671
Well, then we can...

620
00:47:37,508 --> 00:47:39,341
Oh shit!

621
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:53,854
Ah!

622
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,025
Have you guys
seen Brodie tonight?

623
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:02,827
Everyone I've seen is either
dead or psycho-ed.

624
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:03,594
No sign.

625
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:05,963
My Dad said we should
head to the school.

626
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:09,333
It's, um, Greypoint's
civil defense centre.

627
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:10,834
He's a warden.

628
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:14,970
I mean, was until he...
got possessed and...

629
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:17,939
Dude, are you still
going on about that?

630
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:20,474
It was hours ago,
get the fuck over it.

631
00:48:20,476 --> 00:48:21,508
Let's head to the school.

632
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,775
We're not gonna
survive out here.

633
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:24,710
Oh, wait a sec.

634
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:35,419
Oh God.

635
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:38,387
Let's hope the demons
can't read, eh?

636
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,056
You ready?

637
00:48:43,759 --> 00:48:45,925
Let's go.

638
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:15,719
We need you to destroy
the Vocavitque rex daemonia.

639
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,053
Destroy it?

640
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,854
We came to get it.

641
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:21,122
Those who performed
the Black Hymn

642
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,592
may try to reverse it
before Aeloth's ascension.

643
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,926
Can't you destroy it?

644
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:31,864
Only those who still have a
soul can touch the pages.

645
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:34,666
I do not.

646
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,835
I have one condition.

647
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,003
I want to become
Aeloth's vessel.

648
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:47,142
His soul will bind with a the
blackest human soul nearby.

649
00:49:47,144 --> 00:49:51,479
A soul that will not
resist his power.

650
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:56,148
You! No! Please!

651
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,182
No!

652
00:49:59,753 --> 00:50:03,421
Now who doesn't
have a gag reflex?

653
00:50:11,763 --> 00:50:15,565
I pledge allegiance
to Aeloth the Blind.

654
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:18,167
Kill anyone
who gets in your way.

655
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:20,669
You will be rewarded
with more power

656
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:24,038
than you can imagine.

657
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:28,875
Find Brodie. He is the key.

658
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:38,216
Abigail was trying
to tell us something.

659
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:44,620
Maybe...

660
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,226
I'm gonna try and play
this song backwards,

661
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:52,961
Rob Halford style, man.

662
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:53,928
I mean, it makes sense, right?

663
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,029
Reverse all this shit?

664
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:56,530
Fuck that.

665
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:58,198
This town is shit.

666
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,567
We're going up to the lookout
rolling a three-skinner,

667
00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:06,005
and watching this town burn
to the fuckin' ground!

668
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:08,540
Dude, what about Medina,
Giles and Dion?

669
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:09,674
They could all still be alive.

670
00:51:09,676 --> 00:51:12,175
Those guys are dicks.

671
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:16,579
Medina is never gonna
put out for you, man.

672
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:19,114
You're never gonna get to
second base with that girl.

673
00:51:19,116 --> 00:51:21,216
What?

674
00:51:21,218 --> 00:51:23,151
You know, anal.

675
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:26,888
What you think forth base is,
all right

676
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,756
but I'm going for
the music pages.

677
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,826
Dude, fucking stop.

678
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,195
Don't you give a shit
about anyone but yourself?

679
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,696
No, I don't.

680
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,964
Fuck them.

681
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,809
Dude,
I do care about the Holden.

682
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:00,213
Hey, Cocktopus! You win.

683
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:04,183
I'll take you to do the thing
with the music, or whatever.

684
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:05,250
Dude!

685
00:52:09,988 --> 00:52:12,689
Come on. Get in.

686
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,961
Come on.

687
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,677
Okay,

688
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:37,078
so all the shit
is in my room, all right.

689
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,646
But just watch out for
my Aunt and Uncle,

690
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:39,713
because they hate you.

691
00:52:39,715 --> 00:52:43,850
And also...
they might be demons.

692
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:45,418
- Right.
- Okay?

693
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:54,992
Oh shit.

694
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:56,927
But they are into
all that God shit, right?

695
00:52:56,929 --> 00:52:59,095
They'll be sweet, they'll just
pray themselves to safety.

696
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:01,097
No, no, um...

697
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:04,100
No, they were at home
when we played the song.

698
00:53:04,102 --> 00:53:08,671
Look, they definitely
would've heard it, okay?

699
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:22,751
Looks all clear.
I'll get the music.

700
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:29,790
You've been a bad boy, Brodie.

701
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:33,927
I can taste you from here.

702
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,930
Zakk!

703
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,900
Fuck!

704
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:02,348
Shit.

705
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,350
We need to arm up.

706
00:54:08,754 --> 00:54:10,988
- Does your uncle have a gun?
- I doubt it, man.

707
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,122
Fuck!

708
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:13,422
Fuck.

709
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:15,056
Fuck yes!

710
00:54:15,323 --> 00:54:16,990
I bet there are some
crosses in here.

711
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:19,392
Or some bibles we
could bash them with.

712
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,894
What the hell?

713
00:54:21,896 --> 00:54:25,330
Ah, I think they're, um,
they're rosary beads? Yeah.

714
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:29,100
What part of church do they
crank this bad boy, Brodie?

715
00:54:31,337 --> 00:54:32,736
Oh.

716
00:54:32,738 --> 00:54:34,418
- Hey, Brodie?
- What?

717
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:36,472
Oh fuck.

718
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,909
Why would you do that?

719
00:55:22,983 --> 00:55:24,049
It's not working.

720
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:27,859
These are a bit shit.

721
00:55:28,686 --> 00:55:30,885
- Hold them off.
- What?

722
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,205
Yes.

723
00:55:59,176 --> 00:56:00,975
Brodie!

724
00:56:00,977 --> 00:56:02,876
No!

725
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:29,229
No!

726
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:30,463
No!

727
00:56:31,498 --> 00:56:33,899
No! No! Ah. No!

728
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:36,268
Ah! No!

729
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:41,170
I'm going to eat your soul.

730
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:03,322
Fucking die!

731
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,096
No!

732
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:17,498
No! Stop! Please. No!

733
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:07,209
No.

734
00:58:09,245 --> 00:58:10,545
No.

735
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:53,419
What... the fuck?

736
00:59:04,963 --> 00:59:06,964
Pretty sure he
wasn't possessed.

737
00:59:06,966 --> 00:59:08,699
What? Oh no. Of course he was.

738
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:11,101
Because when he
came in he said,

739
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:14,104
ah, something about Satan.

740
00:59:14,605 --> 00:59:17,373
You didn't hear him say that?

741
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,285
Fuck!

742
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:36,754
Hey, the pages
are blowing away.

743
00:59:36,756 --> 00:59:38,489
You have to help me...

744
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,124
Oh sick, man.

745
00:59:41,126 --> 00:59:42,758
What? They were like
that when I found them.

746
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,559
Come on.
We have to get the music.

747
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:46,561
All right, look
I'm going to help you do this,

748
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:48,596
but only because
you suck at it.

749
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:50,030
Also it's kind of fun
stabbing shit.

750
00:59:50,032 --> 00:59:51,564
But we need to get
better weapons.

751
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:53,432
Yeah?

752
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,375
Brutal.

753
01:00:05,377 --> 01:00:07,643
Brutal as fuck.

754
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:53,182
You're pretty good
at whacking guys off, bro.

755
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:15,469
Did you see that?

756
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,636
I'm gonna go check it out.

757
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:19,505
Brodie, you've got
the page, let's go.

758
01:01:19,507 --> 01:01:20,572
Brodie!

759
01:01:26,545 --> 01:01:27,645
Shit!

760
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,313
Medina.

761
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:32,315
Brodie.

762
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:34,816
Hey.

763
01:01:34,818 --> 01:01:36,517
Hey.

764
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:39,720
We're just holed
up in - inside.

765
01:01:39,722 --> 01:01:41,488
We?

766
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,524
When Medina was
killing those demons

767
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:46,425
I got a bit of a half-chub.

768
01:01:46,427 --> 01:01:48,827
Look, let's get back
to the matter at hand here.

769
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:51,563
Seeing as how you're in an
underground dwarven citadel,

770
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:54,666
it looks as if it has
nested hinges, which are...

771
01:01:54,668 --> 01:01:56,701
Oh... Brodie!

772
01:01:56,703 --> 01:01:58,369
Told you they'd be okay.

773
01:01:58,371 --> 01:01:59,803
No you didn't.

774
01:01:59,805 --> 01:02:01,404
You said they were
probably dead already.

775
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:02,805
You wanted dibs on his guitar.

776
01:02:02,807 --> 01:02:05,808
I found these guys
outside your house.

777
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,643
You were looking for us?

778
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:10,946
Of course.
Ah, you got our note, right.

779
01:02:10,948 --> 01:02:14,215
No. I didn't see any note.

780
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:16,983
Oh.

781
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,604
Who would have thought
that Mr. Proctor's

782
01:02:38,605 --> 01:02:40,565
rock collection would
come in handy?

783
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,307
Oh gosh. Your hand.

784
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:45,841
Oh, ah, it's okay.

785
01:02:45,843 --> 01:02:47,909
No.

786
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:55,482
That's Zakk's jacket.

787
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:58,918
When did you get that?

788
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:04,389
He, um...

789
01:03:04,391 --> 01:03:07,392
He lent it to me.

790
01:03:07,394 --> 01:03:12,763
He stopped by the other night
to - to tell me that, um...

791
01:03:12,765 --> 01:03:14,865
you know, hmm.

792
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:17,700
You weren't interested.

793
01:03:19,002 --> 01:03:21,003
What?

794
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,671
The note that I gave
Zakk to give to you

795
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:25,440
to meet me at the park at 9:00.

796
01:03:25,442 --> 01:03:30,578
No.
I didn't get that note either.

797
01:03:34,483 --> 01:03:36,582
So...

798
01:03:38,351 --> 01:03:40,985
did you guys hook up?

799
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,423
Motherfucker!

800
01:03:47,425 --> 01:03:49,525
Brodie, just leave it.

801
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,593
Fuckin' wanker.
You knew I liked her.

802
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,629
Calm the fuck down, all right?

803
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,497
I'm not even into her;
I was just bored.

804
01:03:57,499 --> 01:03:59,866
Oh well. That's supposed
to make it fuckin' better?

805
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:01,868
What happened to
Brotherhood of Steel?

806
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:04,337
Everyone was fuckin'
right about you.

807
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,772
- You're a piece of shit.
- Fuck you!

808
01:04:06,774 --> 01:04:10,809
You let this happen by being
such an insecure pussy.

809
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:15,046
Yeah, that's right walk away.

810
01:04:15,048 --> 01:04:17,481
Grow some fucking balls, man.

811
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:23,352
Motherfucker!

812
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:32,425
You motherfucker.
You knew I liked her.

813
01:04:32,427 --> 01:04:35,094
Save it for the demons you two.

814
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:37,829
All right.

815
01:04:38,463 --> 01:04:40,497
All right.

816
01:04:49,705 --> 01:04:52,406
Fuck you!

817
01:04:52,408 --> 01:04:55,509
I never even liked you.

818
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:02,481
Good luck
fighting evil without me.

819
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:05,884
You're all gonna fuckin' die.

820
01:05:09,955 --> 01:05:12,790
Death to false metal!

821
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:17,928
I expected this.

822
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:21,398
He's Chaotic Neutral
and you're Lawful Good.

823
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,134
Your alignments are
just totally mismatched.

824
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:39,379
It was hard enough
playing it forwards.

825
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:41,514
Will take a few goes.

826
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:43,382
Well, time isn't
exactly on our side.

827
01:05:43,384 --> 01:05:45,016
When we first played the song,

828
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:47,551
everyone in the neighborhood
got possessed first, right?

829
01:05:47,553 --> 01:05:50,153
Well, they were all
within earshot.

830
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,988
But our amps blew up.

831
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,457
Right. Okay, so we need
some serious decibels.

832
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:55,791
Well, does the school have any?

833
01:05:55,793 --> 01:05:59,594
Our whole music class had
to share the same recorder.

834
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:01,429
I can still taste it.

835
01:06:01,431 --> 01:06:02,897
I know a place that has amps.

836
01:06:02,899 --> 01:06:06,433
Not sure if they still work,
but it's our only chance.

837
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:07,834
Out there?

838
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:09,001
It's gonna be crazy.

839
01:06:09,003 --> 01:06:10,869
And we don't have
a car without Zakk.

840
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:12,503
Zakk can eat my ass.

841
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:14,738
We don't need him
we can do it on our own.

842
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,006
Fuck yeah.

843
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,910
Fuck yeah.

844
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:24,012
Let's tear shit up.

845
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:34,687
Shh. Stay low.

846
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:40,492
Come on.

847
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:48,031
Just chill, all right.
We're not demons.

848
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:49,198
Drop the weapons.

849
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,667
Now.

850
01:06:54,138 --> 01:06:57,839
I can't tell if I have a fear
boner or a boner... boner.

851
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:01,042
I didn't even say anything.
Hit him.

852
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:02,476
Listen, just let us go, okay.

853
01:07:02,478 --> 01:07:05,946
The town is overrun
with fucking demons.

854
01:07:05,948 --> 01:07:08,949
We know exactly
what we are doing.

855
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:11,151
Give me the Vogue-catty
queff-wrecks-demony.

856
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:14,154
Um, it's actually pronounced
Vocavitque rex daemonia.

857
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,689
That tongue wasn't
meant for Latin.

858
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:18,857
Oh. Come on.

859
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:20,892
The Black Hymn, where is it?

860
01:07:20,894 --> 01:07:22,627
I don't know
what you talking about.

861
01:07:22,629 --> 01:07:24,761
- Ah, no.
- Ow.

862
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:32,534
Don't tell this Manson family
cumbucket anything, Brodie.

863
01:07:32,536 --> 01:07:35,169
Okay, okay.

864
01:07:37,472 --> 01:07:39,005
It's here.

865
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,675
No!

866
01:07:49,047 --> 01:07:50,981
Tie them up,
take them in the bedroom.

867
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,916
They can be a live
offering for Aeloth.

868
01:07:52,918 --> 01:07:55,652
No. No, please, let us go.

869
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,820
You had your chance.

870
01:07:57,822 --> 01:07:59,221
You awakened Aeloth,

871
01:07:59,223 --> 01:08:01,823
pleaded with him to take
away your weakness

872
01:08:01,825 --> 01:08:03,791
and vanquish your enemies.

873
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:07,928
He would've given you
power, fame, fortune,

874
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,897
and any woman you want.

875
01:08:10,899 --> 01:08:12,565
But you blew it.

876
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:13,799
Is that true Brodie?

877
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:15,801
You did all of this for power?

878
01:08:15,803 --> 01:08:18,003
- I didn't want this.
- Get them out.

879
01:08:18,005 --> 01:08:20,672
Whoa, whoa, okay. Okay, okay.

880
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:34,051
Do you think if we soil
our pants, they'll let us go?

881
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,054
I guess we'll find out soon.

882
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:45,726
In sanguine.
Intra in sanguinem.

883
01:08:45,728 --> 01:08:49,896
De caelo laceri.
Lacerato horrorem.

884
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:54,199
Proin cursus meum.
Regnabunt autem in sanguine.

885
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:57,735
Hey, I never meant
for this to happen, okay?

886
01:08:57,737 --> 01:09:00,237
I just want to
let you know that.

887
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:03,205
I was desperate.

888
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,908
I just -
I felt so fuckin' powerless.

889
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:16,849
You are not powerless, Brodie.

890
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:19,952
You can till stop this.

891
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:22,054
I know you can.

892
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,256
What was that, guys?

893
01:09:28,725 --> 01:09:30,058
Shit.

894
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,993
There's something in there.

895
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:49,041
Which one of you cunts

896
01:09:49,043 --> 01:09:53,378
wants to be skull-fucked first?

897
01:09:54,213 --> 01:09:56,413
No.

898
01:09:58,683 --> 01:10:02,951
No, no. Not me.
I - I need my skull for exams.

899
01:10:05,155 --> 01:10:09,957
Sacrifice is a noble act,
you know.

900
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:12,292
Fucking old bastard.

901
01:10:13,328 --> 01:10:15,294
Oh my God.

902
01:10:31,308 --> 01:10:32,474
Did you miss me?

903
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,453
I thought you were
off to the lookout.

904
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:51,223
Realized I couldn't
leave my mate in the shit.

905
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:54,359
Not with all these
demons to mega-kill.

906
01:10:57,396 --> 01:11:00,297
Metalheads stick together,
right?

907
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:05,267
Whoa, wait.

908
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:07,235
You decided that you
wanted to help us,

909
01:11:07,237 --> 01:11:09,937
and then you went
and applied makeup?

910
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:12,239
Well, how long did it take?
What ten... fifteen minutes?

911
01:11:12,241 --> 01:11:14,741
It's not makeup;
It's fucking corpse paint.

912
01:11:14,743 --> 01:11:15,441
For going into battle?

913
01:11:15,443 --> 01:11:20,412
Well, you look adorable.
It really brings out your eyes.

914
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:23,281
What's the plan?

915
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:24,415
Okay. I get my guitar.

916
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:26,283
You guys get me to the amps.
Cover me.

917
01:11:26,285 --> 01:11:27,917
But she ripped up the pages.

918
01:11:27,919 --> 01:11:31,053
Do you really think you can
play it from memory?

919
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:33,221
I have to try.

920
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:36,423
One more thing...

921
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,226
can you quickly pull me off?

922
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:46,029
Oh right.

923
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:51,399
De caelo laceri.
Lacerato horrorem.

924
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,772
Metal up your ass,
motherfucker!

925
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:13,983
Ah!

926
01:12:33,799 --> 01:12:34,519
No!

927
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:43,337
Well, he was right behind us.

928
01:12:43,339 --> 01:12:46,940
There's only a few
fucking rooms.

929
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:48,007
Dion!

930
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:17,898
Fuck!

931
01:13:26,205 --> 01:13:28,172
Giles!

932
01:14:21,288 --> 01:14:22,153
Hurry, Brodie.

933
01:14:22,155 --> 01:14:24,188
Trying.

934
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,423
Kill them all!

935
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:14,569
It's three AM.

936
01:15:34,654 --> 01:15:38,723
Aeloth! Come in to me!

937
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:43,526
Fill me with your power!

938
01:16:18,393 --> 01:16:20,493
So much power!

939
01:16:20,495 --> 01:16:23,195
This is fucking brutal.

940
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,767
What?

941
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,238
Oh fuck.

942
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:39,774
You know, I'm not even sure
I'm in the right tuning.

943
01:16:56,188 --> 01:16:59,256
So, dude, I'm thinking
about doing a 'Burzum'

944
01:16:59,258 --> 01:17:03,493
and starting my own
solo project.

945
01:17:08,731 --> 01:17:10,498
Medina!

946
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,400
Run! Run!

947
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:17,803
I mean, you and
the rest of the band

948
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:19,404
are just dead weight.

949
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:23,374
Dude, zip up your fly.
I can see your dong.

950
01:17:23,376 --> 01:17:24,308
What?

951
01:17:30,214 --> 01:17:31,546
You don't get it, do you?

952
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:33,147
You can't stop me.

953
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,315
I'm gonna destroy
this world of shit,

954
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,484
one maggot at a time.

955
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:44,489
Medina!

956
01:17:57,235 --> 01:17:59,169
Look at it this way...

957
01:17:59,171 --> 01:18:02,638
you're about to lose five kgs.
without a crash diet.

958
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,238
Fuck it.

959
01:18:12,577 --> 01:18:15,946
No, no, no, no.
That's not gonna work.

960
01:18:15,948 --> 01:18:20,350
You have to play the
black hymn, fuckin' idiot.

961
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:00,885
Zakk.

962
01:19:02,254 --> 01:19:04,388
Thanks, man.

963
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:06,923
The metal brought me back.

964
01:19:13,496 --> 01:19:15,663
I'm trying to hold him off.

965
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:18,331
He's gonna destroy everything.

966
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,865
Dude, fight it.

967
01:19:19,867 --> 01:19:23,868
I mean, you're the
strong one remember.

968
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:29,372
I can't. He's too powerful.

969
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:30,872
Finish me.

970
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:35,242
Quickly. Before Aeloth
takes over again.

971
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:38,977
Man, I can't, I can't.

972
01:19:42,714 --> 01:19:44,014
You have to do it.
There's no other way.

973
01:19:44,016 --> 01:19:45,915
Send him back to hell.

974
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,818
Do it!

975
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:29,986
Brotherhood of steel, dude.

976
01:20:30,654 --> 01:20:33,489
Brotherhood of steel, forever.

977
01:21:01,748 --> 01:21:04,750
I don't know, I just...

978
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:06,952
I can't stand mic cupping.

979
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:08,520
Cannibal Corpse do it.

980
01:21:08,522 --> 01:21:10,555
No. Barnes used to do it.

981
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:12,557
Fisher...

982
01:21:12,559 --> 01:21:14,392
it's straight from the guts.

983
01:21:14,394 --> 01:21:18,061
Shit, did I just get schooled?

984
01:21:18,063 --> 01:21:20,996
I'm a very fast learner.

985
01:21:21,897 --> 01:21:22,963
How's the tat?

986
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,564
Mmm.

987
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:26,732
It's all healed up.

988
01:21:30,336 --> 01:21:32,737
I'll see you later.

989
01:21:58,962 --> 01:22:01,029
You really thought
this was over?

990
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:02,964
Time to die, Brodie!

991
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:11,804
No, just kidding, dude.

992
01:22:11,806 --> 01:22:13,739
Zakk?

993
01:25:19,224 --> 01:25:22,226
So what's like being dead?

994
01:25:22,228 --> 01:25:24,695
Hell is awesome!

995
01:25:24,697 --> 01:25:26,563
Like, met some music legends:

996
01:25:26,565 --> 01:25:27,931
Dio, Kurt Cobain,

997
01:25:27,933 --> 01:25:28,965
Dimebag,

998
01:25:28,967 --> 01:25:31,300
Jon Bonham, Paul McCartney.

999
01:25:31,302 --> 01:25:34,870
Yeah, the true, true
Mayhem reunited, too.

1000
01:25:34,872 --> 01:25:36,771
So cold, dude.

1001
01:25:36,773 --> 01:25:39,240
Fucking brutal as.

1002
01:25:39,242 --> 01:25:41,141
Anyway, the band.

1003
01:25:41,143 --> 01:25:43,243
You got to keep playing, dude.

1004
01:25:43,245 --> 01:25:45,311
Yeah, but everyone is dead.

1005
01:25:45,313 --> 01:25:47,880
We can't keep calling
ourselves DEATHGASM.

1006
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:49,248
Doesn't feel right.

1007
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,716
All right then.
Well, change it.

1008
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:53,852
How about...
Bandsaw Circumcision?

1009
01:25:53,854 --> 01:25:54,986
Intesticide?

1010
01:25:54,988 --> 01:25:57,588
What about, like,
Bestiality Bliss?

1011
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,957
Yeah, how about
Birth Canal Boat Riders?

1012
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:02,125
What about The God Buggerers?

1013
01:26:02,127 --> 01:26:04,060
How about David Bain's Scrotum.

1014
01:26:04,062 --> 01:26:05,861
Anal Bulimia?
