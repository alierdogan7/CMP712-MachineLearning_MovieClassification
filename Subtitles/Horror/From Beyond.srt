I was assisting Dr. Pretorious
with his experiments, yes.

00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:00,244
What was the purpose
of the experiments?

93
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,878
To stimulate the pineal gland
with resonant vibrations.

94
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,548
The pineal gland. Why?

95
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:12,095
Dr. Pretorious believed that the pineal
was a dormant sensory organ.

96
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:13,857
- A sixth sense.
- Yes.

113

155

that the experiment they were performing

156

actually does stimulate the pineal.

that he saw these creatures.

160

00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,889
You're my patient now, Dr. Tillinghast.

184
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,831
Thank you.

185
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,901
I'll call for an appointment.

186
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,666
No, no, no, wait a minute.

187
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:48,765
You've been released into my custody.
You'll have to come with me.

188
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,708
Where do you plan on taking me?

189
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:52,973
Back to the Pretorious house.

190
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,110
I want you to recreate your experiment.

191
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:58,782
No.

192
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,412
Look, you can either stay here
for the rest of your life,

193
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:03,458
or you can come with me.

194
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,995
That's not much of a choice, is it?

195
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,423
I believe you, Crawford.

196
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,592
I wanna see what you saw.

197
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,341
Hi. You must be Dr. McMichaels.

198
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,351
No, I'm Dr. McMichaels.

199
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,081
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

200
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,850

We were all crazy.

206

Not exactly cheery.

210
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:55,095
Dr. Tillinghast,
would you care to show us around?

211
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:07,077
Doctor, if you're telling us the truth,
the only way to free yourself is to go back,

212
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,211
through this door.

213
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:38,513
Come on, Doc.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

214
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:41,511
Look, I'll show you.

215
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:03,461

217
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:07,834

- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

218
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:10,039
Electrical cables.

219
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:15,443
We needed more power
so I rewired the whole house.

220
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,183
Where are the circuit breakers, Doctor?

221
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:23,218
Doctor?

222
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,229
Tillinghast.

223
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,229
Damn it, we lost him.

224
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,133
He knows this place better than we do.

225
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,841
First thing's to find the power.

226
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:58,356
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

227
00:23:58,463 --> 00:24:01,398
I'll bet these cables lead to the Resonator.

228
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:04,161

00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:57,372
We can start in the morning, Crawford.

257
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:00,950
I've started.

258
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:03,984
McMICHAELS: All right.

259
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,785
All this talking about eating
is making me hungry.

260
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,091
How about getting some dinner, huh?

261
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,163
Real danger here is starving.

262
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:28,200
Pretty, isn't she?

263
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,400
CRAWFORD: She's beautiful.

264
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,209
So how's it going, Doc?

265
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,804
Need some help?

266
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,509
He used to bring beautiful women here.

267
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:44,956
They'd eat fine meals, drink fine wine,
listen to music.

268
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,263
But it always ended with screaming.

269
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,495
And I would just lie there
and listen to them.

270
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:01,271
Screaming.

271
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:06,475
- Your boss had some screws loose.
- He was a genius.

272
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:14,518
It's just that the five senses
weren't enough for him. He wanted more.

273
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:20,517
Is it finished?

274
00:29:21,062 --> 00:29:22,552
Are we ready?

275
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:24,423
Yes.

276
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,339
I had to bypass the computer

277
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,545
because the magnetic field
erased the program.

278
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:41,640
And, of course,
the monitor is completely useless.

279
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:47,053
So the entire system
has to be manually operated.

280
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:50,125
And unfortunately the Resonator
was so severely damaged

281
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:53,992
that I had to convert it
to just an on/ off system.

282
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:59,033
When we reach 20,000 megahertz,
we throw this switch,

283
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:05,005
and a powerful magnetic field vibrates
these forks at a precise frequency.

284
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:08,440
Stimulating the pineal gland,
allowing us to see with it.

285
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:09,977
Listen to me.

286
00:30:10,847 --> 00:30:14,944
Don't move when we're in the field
of the vibrations.

287
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:18,249
- McMICHAELS: Why?
- You move and they may see you.

288
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:21,518
It will see you.

289
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,115
What is this "it" anyway?

290
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:25,661
Pray you don't see for yourself.

291
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:28,789
Now, I'm staying right by this switch.

292
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:31,265
If it appears, I'm shutting down.

293
00:30:32,236 --> 00:30:34,670
Are you sure we're ready for this?

294
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:37,467

00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,934
Can't work without eating.

364
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:02,436
- What work?
- Well, I've got to record the results.

365
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:05,029
The pineal gland was stimulated.

366
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:09,271
- It gave me one hell of a headache.
- Expansion of the pineal.

367
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,948
I'll have to do a study
of the CAT scans of schizophrenics.

368
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:17,019
If there's a statistical correlation

369
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,351
between schizophrenia
and an enlarged pineal,

370
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:23,153
why, they may be seeing
or feeling what we saw.

371
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,491
Their minds may be influenced
by those creatures.

372
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,195
Well how about the hard-on I got?

373
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,098
Is there a statistical correlation
for that, too?

374
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:40,199
Well, we know that the pineal gland
helps to regulate the sex drive.

375
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:43,474
Perhaps pineal stimulation causes

376
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,481
an accompanying sexual stimulation.

377
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:49,647
There's so much to learn.

378
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:51,847
Well, we learned what we came for.

379
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:56,552
He ain't crazy
and that "it" ate Pretorious' head.

380
00:37:57,395 --> 00:38:00,660
They're gonna think we're crazy,
but that's their problem.

381
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:03,791
Well, we just have to try
the experiment again.

382
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:07,264
Did you say, "we"?

383
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:10,198
Katherine, you can't.

384
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:12,401
You don't mean
go back up there now, do you?

385
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,037
You always run an experiment twice,
to check the results.

386
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:19,982
Wait, now I saw it get to him, Katherine.

387
00:38:20,086 --> 00:38:22,748
Just exactly what you're feeling,
and it ruined him.

388
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:24,482
Pretorious.

389
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,151
Yes, I'd like to know more about him.

390
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,728
That Resonator is a work of genius.

391
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,362
Were we in the same nightmare?

392
00:38:35,468 --> 00:38:38,995
I mean, didn't we just almost all
get eaten by an "it"?

393
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:42,404
All it takes is a hand on the switch.
If it appears, you make it disappear.

394
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:45,773
I got a better idea.
How about if we disappear out the door?

395
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:49,143
Don't you understand? This is the
greatest discovery since van Leeuwenhoek

396
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:51,217
first looked through a microscope
and saw an amoeba.

397
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:53,878
Yeah, but he wasn't down there
with the amoebas.

398
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:56,478
I have to find out
if the pineal gland is really the key.

399
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,924
Okay, fine. Fine, but not here, not now.

400
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,587
- Under controlled conditions.
- But we have control.

401
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,722

better than you do.

408

They called his condition incurable.

409
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:32,084
They tried everything,
drugs, shock therapy, even surgery.

410
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:36,455
