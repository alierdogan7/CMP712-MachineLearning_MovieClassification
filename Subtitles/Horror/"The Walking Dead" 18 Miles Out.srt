Yo, is someone in there?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,005
We're just looking for a friend.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,982
Get out of here!

5
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,781
We gotta go!
Roamers are everywhere!

6
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:16,106
I'm sorry!

7
00:00:16,243 --> 00:00:17,398
We can't leave him!

8
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:22,189
We give him a canteen,take him out
to the main road, send him on his way.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,378
-  He knows where we are.
- He's not a threat.

10
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:29,509
Shane thinks I'm his. He thinks the
baby is his. He is dangerous.

So why are we stopping?

21
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,881
I wanted to talk.

22
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:23,218
Been waiting a week
till we were gonna do this.

23
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:28,006
- I just wanna talk.
- We don't need to.

24
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,926
We do.

doesn't know where the farm is.

to talk to you about.

at the school.

Yeah.

35
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,611
One of us wasn't
gonna make it out.

36
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,747
It had to be him.

37
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,886
One shot to the leg,
Carl lives.

38

Reality is...

39
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,561
He had no business
being here--

40
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,817
There. Whatever.

41
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,624
You don't think
I would've done it?

42
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,125
No, man, I know
you wouldn't have.

43
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,328
You don't think I can keep
Lori or Carl safe?

44
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,248
I didn't say that.

45
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,083
Or my baby?

00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,005
Rick, you can't just be the
good guy and expect to live.

48
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,924
Okay? Not anymore.

49
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,143
I'm not the good guy anymore.

50
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,396
To save Carl's life,

51
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,349
I would've done
anything-- anything.

52
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:04,069
Now Lori says you're dangerous,

53
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,404
but you're not
gonna be dangerous.

54
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,774
Not to us, not to me,
not anymore.

55
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,113
How about you look at me?

56
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,786
You and Lori--

57
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,375
I get what happened.

58
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,847
When I figured it out-- and I
figured it out pretty quickly--

59
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,182
I wanted to break your jaw,

60
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:37,219
let you choke on your teeth.

61
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,038
But I didn't.

62
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:44,109
That wasn't weakness.

63
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,728
It took everything.

64
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:53,318
That is my wife.
That is my son.

65
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,370
That is my unborn child.

66
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:58,990
I will stay alive
to keep them alive.

67
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:09,751
You don't love her.

68
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:12,837
You think you do,
but you don't.

69
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,678
Now the only way
you and me keep on...

70
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,848
Is that you accept
everything I just said

71
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,267
right here, right now,

72
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:28,019
and we move forward
with that understanding.

73
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:46,972
When it started
it was just--

74
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,624
It was a couple of weird
stories on the news.

75
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:54,545
Then-- then it was
so quick.

76
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,184
Everything--
It just happened.

77
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:03,054
Two weeks later,
I'm in the hospital

78
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,190
and there were soldiers
shooting people in the halls.

79
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,275
They were shooting people,
man, not walkers.

80
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,394
Then the walkers came through.

81
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:14,065
You know,
I tried to get you out,

82
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,234
I tried, but we weren't
gonna make it.

83
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,736
Man, there was no way
and I knew it.

84
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,872
But I couldn't live with it.

85
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,075
I couldn't live,
knowing--

86
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,662
( Sighs ) But I had to.

87
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,415
I didn't keep Lori
and Carl alive, man.

88
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,050
They kept me alive.

89
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,841
I want you to know that I
didn't look at her before that.

90
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:42,927
Brother, if I could
take it all back, I would.

91
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:50,402
I wanna check the ropes.

95
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,800
Rick say anything to you about Glenn
when they got back from town?

96
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,303
Just that it had
gotten pretty bad.

97
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,189
He's not the same.

98
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,692
- ( Sniffs )
- Says he froze.

99
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:32,810
Blames me. Says I got
inside his head.

100
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,947
He came back--
that's what matters.

101
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,984
Men have to do certain things--
You know that--

102
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,570
And they're either gonna
blame the little woman

103
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:44,823
as the reason they do 'em
or the reason they don't.

104
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,825
I'll tell you something-- what
happens out there happens out there.

105
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,879
And we--

106
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,881
we're just trying to keep it
together till they get back.

107
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,500
- Things were good. Maybe I--
- Glenn's a big boy.

108
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,219
He makes his own choices,
and then you--

109
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,388
<i>do you have anything</i>
<i>to apologize for?</i>

110
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:07,846

178
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,056
( Softly ) Hey.

179
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,760
I know how hard it is.

180
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:40,097
I tried for days
to reach my mom,

181
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,599
and get her on the phone.

182
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,986
I can only assume--
It's just so pointless.

183
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,771
Oh.

184
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,023
You have Maggie,

185
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,109
and your father,
Patricia and Jimmy.

186
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:56,113
And you've gotta
stay strong for them.

187
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:03,503
I wish I could promise you it
would be all right in the end.

188
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,621
I can't,

189
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:08,792
but we can make now
all right...

190
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,011
And we have to.

191
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,050
Thank you.

192
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,809
I'll be right back.
We'll go take that walk.

193
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,821
( Exhales deeply )

194
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,325
( Fork clatters )

195
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,210
Beth?

196
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,834
You give it to me, sweetheart.

197
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,303
You don't wanna do this.

198
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:17,527
Andrea, have you seen
Maggie or Hershel?

199
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,613
I haven't seen Hershel, but I
saw Maggie and Glenn walk by

200
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:21,365
- maybe 20 minutes ago.
- Could you find her for me?

201
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,866
I've gotta get back
to the house.

202
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,701
Of course.

203
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,124
( Muffled music playing )

204
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,460
( Grunts )

205
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:35,545
( Softly ) Sorry.

206
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,797
Oh.

207
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,382
( Whimpers )

208
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,885
- The hell is this?
- <i>( Music stops )</i>

209
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,691
Oh, come on, don't be stupid.

210
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,976
I owe you guys.

211
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:52,529
<i>I can help protect</i>
<i>what you've got.</i>

212
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,899
Why would you save my life just
to kill me by leaving me here?

213
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,286
One guy-- one guy
can't make it alone.

214
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,872
That's why I was with those
dudes-- I was alone.

215
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,743
Don't be stupid!
I'm not like them!

216
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm just some guy!

217
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,314
I used to watch football

218
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,667
and screw around
on the Internet.

219
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,918
<i>I lived with my mom!</i>

220
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,804
I lost her
like you lost people.

221
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,307
I went to school with Maggie
for God's sake!

222
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:28,398
I went to church.

223
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,151
I rode the bench
on varsity baseball.

224
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,736
You went to school with Maggie?

225
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,354
You go to school with Maggie?

226
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:35,939
<i>Answer the question!</i>

227
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,190
<i>Did you go to school</i>
<i>with Maggie?</i>

228
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,860
I-- it--
she didn't know me.

229
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:42,162
Didn't even know I existed.

230
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:45,782
I mean, I knew her.

231
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,035
I knew who her dad was.

232
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:51,955
There is no way
I would ever do anything

233
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,508
- to hurt her or her family.
- Jesus.

234
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,960
Or you--
or your people!

235
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,963
<i>I'm not like the guys</i>
<i>I was with!</i>

236
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,765
( Whispering ) He knows
where the farm is, Rick.

237
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,050
Where we are--
he knows.

238
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,803
Say he finds his way
back to his people...

239
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,279
- Shane, no!
- ( Gunshot )

240
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,199
- ( Grunts )
- Not now-- just not now!

241
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:25,405
Well, when, Rick? When?

242
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,657
( Clatters )

243
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,378
When I've had a chance
to think about it.

244
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,413
Don't let him kill me.
Please don't.

245
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,832
Shut up!

246
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,220
We're going back.
It's a man's life.

247
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,639
I need a night
to think it through.

248
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,975
You're gonna bring
this piece of garbage--

249
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,510
this piece
of garbage who--

250
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,845
he shot at you, Rick.

251
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,180
He ran with men
who tried to kill you.

252
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,399
You gonna bring him back
to where Lori sleeps?

253
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,234
<i>To where Carl sleeps?</i>

254
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:55,769
He'll be locked up in the barn,

255
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:58,354
- unless you bust it open.
- Oh, don't start that shit.

256
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,490
- I'm taking the night.
- Man, you take that--

257
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,276
you think on it, Rick.
Keep struggling with it.

258
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:04,444
It ain't hard, man.

259
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,746
The right choice is
the one that keeps us alive.

260
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,281
<i>It's always the same with you.</i>

261
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:11,368
It's like the first moment-- it's
whenever you're put to the test.

262
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,121
Stop acting like you know the way
ahead, like you know the rules.

263
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:17,040
There are no rules, man.
We're lost.

264
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,925
No-no-no, man.
I know exactly where I am.

265
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,210
You don't know shit anymore.

266
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,011
I don't think
you can do it, Rick.

267
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,179
It's my call, man.

268
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,430
I don't think you can
keep them safe.

Ah!

No!

276
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:40,339
Get off me, man.

( Grunting, panting )

279
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:11,954
You're not doing this!

280
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:16,324
You don't get to make
these calls anymore.

281
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:18,994
- ( Both panting )
- I won't let you.

282
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,502
( Yells )

283
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:47,906

Maggie: <i>Are you crazy?
What if dad finds out?</i>

286
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:30,699
What's he gonna do?
Kill me for committing suicide?

287
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,785
Stop being such a brat.

288
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:35,537
He'd die.

289
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:38,040
So would I.

290
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,775
This isn't just about you.

291
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:42,144
We all lost mom.

292
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,212
We'll lose each other
and I couldn't stand that.

293
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:46,748
So you give up?

294
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:51,920

Come on, bitch.
Let's see what you got.

298

( Grunting )

299
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:56,451
( Maggie and Beth arguing )

300
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:05,627
Where's Hershel?

301
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,246
He doesn't want
to find out yet.

302
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,134
It's a family affair.
We'll let them work it out.

303
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,802
That's working it out?

304
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,837
When Beth stops fighting,
that's when it's time to worry.

305

<i>( Arguing continues )</i>

306
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,259
<i>( Maggie yells )</i>
<i>You are being so selfish!</i>

307
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:24,012
This could've
been handled better.

308
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:26,398
How so?

309
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,600
You shouldn't have
taken the knife away.

310
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:32,771
- Excuse me?
- You were wrong,

311
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:35,440
like Dale taking my gun.
That wasn't your decision.

312
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,277
<i>She has to choose</i>
<i>to live on her own.</i>

313
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,663
She has to find
her own reasons.

314
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,031
Want me to tie a noose for her?

315
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,033
If she's serious,
she'll figure out a way.

316
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,534
Doesn't mean I can't stop her

317
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:48,753
or let her know that I care.

318
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,372
That has nothing
to do with it, Lori.

319
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:52,507
She only has so many
choices in front of her,

320
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:55,043
and she believes
the best one is suicide.

321
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:57,095
- That's not an option.
- Of course it is.

322
00:26:57,097 --> 00:27:00,265
She doesn't need to be yelled
at or treated like a child.

323
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,100
She needs a loaded gun, right?

324
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:04,603
You'll understand if
I don't send you in there.

325
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:05,971
I came through it.

326
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,807
And became such a productive
member of the group.

327
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:09,774
Let Maggie handle this her way.

328
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:11,026
I contribute.

329
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,811
I help keep this place safe.

330
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:16,731
The men can handle
this on their own.

331
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,700
They don't need your help.

332
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:22,988
I'm sorry.
What would you have me do?

333
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,323
Oh, there's plenty
of work to go around.

334
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:26,741
Are you serious?

335
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:27,909
Everything falls apart,

336
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:30,128
you're in my face over
skipping laundry?

337
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:33,215
Puts a burden
on the rest of us,

338
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:36,134
on me and Carol,
and Patricia and Maggie.

339
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:37,802
Cooking, cleaning
and caring for Beth.

340
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:40,722
And you-- you don't
care about anyone

341
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,507
but yourself--
You sit up on that RV,

342
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:44,926
working on your tan
with a shotgun in your lap.

343
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:49,514
No, I am on watch
against walkers.

344
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:50,932
That is what matters,

345
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,601
not fresh mint leaves
in the lemonade.

346
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:54,653
And we are providing stability.

347
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:57,155
We are trying to create
a life worth living.

348
00:27:57,157 --> 00:27:59,608
Are you kidding me?

349
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,328
Look, I went after Rick.
I took down two walkers.

350
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,330
- After crashing Maggie's car.

00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:30,298
- I didn't do anything! - You shot at
my boys, tried to take this farm!

537
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,198
And you're trying to
tell me you're innocent?

538
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:34,862
He has got a gun and
I'm looking for my friend.

539
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:37,386
- You're just gonna kill him?
- People are scared!

540
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,572
They need to be safe!
I owe them that.

541
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,092
- Rick's the leader of this group.
- We all chase that.

542
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:46,436
If we do this, the people we worded,
the world that we knew is dead!
