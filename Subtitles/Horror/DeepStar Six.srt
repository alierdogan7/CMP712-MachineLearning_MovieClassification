1
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,135
- What did you say?
- I was on the ocean in a boat.

2
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,450
It was a dream.

3
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,096
That's the third time
you've had that dream this month.

4
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,053
Do you think the new site
for the missile platform is a lock?

5
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,334
Van Gelder thinks so. With any luck,
we'll be home in a week.

6
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,418
That's good, I'm ready.

7
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,171
What are you gonna do
when we get out of here?

8
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,373
Hang out with Laidlaw's family
till I get a new assignment.

9
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,495
- The Captain's got a great wife.
- Great wife, great kids.

10
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,488
The Captain, he's got it made.

11
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,257
How come you never got married?

12
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,970
It's too early
for this kind of conversation.

13
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,377
No, really, why did you never
get married?

14
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,568
I've never been in one place
long enough.

15
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,291
We've gotten pretty close
the last couple of months.

16
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,699
Get any closer,
we'd wear each other's shorts.

17
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,214
It's different with you.
You're like one of the guys.

18
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,858
Is your stomach still bothering you?

19
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,336
I think it's that dried-outjunk
we had last night.

20
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,373
Have Dr. Norris examine you.

21
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,496
- I'm just tired of the food.
- Me, too. I'd kill for a Big Mac.

22
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,330
- Locking collar? Umbilicals?
- Clear.

23
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,418
Get ready to detach.

24
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,093
This is about the twentieth time
I've read this magazine.

25
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,010
- I'd like to see a new movie.
- How about breathing fresh air?

26
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,259
Six months at the bottom of the ocean
is more than I bargained for.

27
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,975
- Peace is our profession.
- Exactly.

28
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,933
There she blows.
Transponder contact, 550 metres.

29
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,770
- Reduce speed.
- DSRV-2 to Seatrak, come in.

30
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,814
- This is Seatrak. Go, Richardson.
- We're on the turnpike.

31
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,695
About time, the shift change
was 20 minutes ago.

32
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,418
Good morning to you, too, Snyder.
Put a candle in the window for us.

33
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,977
Work lights on,
homing beacon activated.

34
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,454
- Collar in place, umbilicals locked.
- Pressure steady. Airlock purge.

35
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,733
Hodges! Come on.

36
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,694
Time to make the world
a better place.

37
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,688
- See you later.
- Bet on it.

38
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,848
- Welcome aboard.
- Always a pleasure.

39
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,609
- Johnny, my man. What it be like?
- Another day in paradise.

40
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,291
- I left something in your video.
- Are we talking Miss September?

41
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,015
Is it hot? Is it wet? Is it smooth?

42
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,135
Good morning.
I see you've been very busy.

43
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,299
Snyder and I have drifted the missile
sled over the site last night.

44
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,575
- We just stabilized the platform.
- And I calculated the new trajectory.

45
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,093
Good. When you finish, have Collins
and her men anchor the platform.

46
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,579
- We have to do the sounding first.
- That's not necessary.

47
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,419
This area is stable.

48
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,659
But even the smallest geological
defect can cause instability...

49
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,980
I don't want to see a stray missile
hitting some nice house.

50
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,890
Very well, take some soundings.
I'll get Collins to start excavating.

51
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,490
- Wait till I get the soundings.
- I don't have time to wait.

52
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,339
You have your orders.

53
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,934
- All set to go, Doc?
- Any time you're ready.

54
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,053
- Snyder, secure that hatch.
- Securing the hatch.

55
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,733
DSRV-2 to Seatrak.
We are secure for departure.

56
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,931
- Morning, campers.
- Morning, Captain.

57
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,859
- Snyder, would you slow down?
- You worried about my health?

58
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,097
- You're making me sick.
- Weren't we out of oatmeal?

59
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,054
- That's eggs.
- Not eating, Scarpelli?

60
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,412
No, I've got some work to finish.

61
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,410
I want you to take the day off.
That's an order.

62
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,533
Great, after breakfast
I could help you with a few sets.

63
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,698
No, you fix the leak
in the docking bay.

64
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,210
And after that,
you fix the starter in DRSV-1.

65
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,890
- But after that...
- You report to me.

66
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,218
I said it was Scarpelli's day off,
not yours.

67
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,693
That sound always
gives me the creeps.

68
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,495
It's just adjusting to the pressure.

69
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:05,457
- Snyder, call Collins for me.
- Can I finish eating first?

70
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,938
- You just talked to her...
- Damn it, Snyder!

71
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,578
A guy can't even finish breakfast
around here. Let's go.

72
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,656
- Now he needs a day off.
- More like a month.

73
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,331
Bullpen, this is Deepstar.
Please, acknowledge.

74
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,577
- Go ahead.
- How's it going?

75
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,453
Switch to video, please.

76
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,618
- She's all yours.
- I want a progress report.

77
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,972
Nothing to report. I've ordered
Hodges and Osborne to stop digging.

78
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,492
Burciaga noticed
some unusual soundings.

79
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,497
We think there's a cavern
under the site.

80
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,659
- Better take a look at it.
- No, I'm not going to waste time.

81
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,648
It's too late to change sites.
The Navy would shut us down.

82
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,935
They'll do that anyway. You can't
place a missile sled over a cavern.

83
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,053
Collapse it with explosives,
and put the sled on top.

84
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,218
According to the soundings,
the cavern is pretty deep.

85
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,379
I don't care how deep it is!
Blow it up if you have to.

86
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,051
I want that missile sled in place
before the end of the week.

87
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,813
I think he likes you, Collins.
Have a nice day.

88
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,689
What ajerk.
Seatrak to Seacat, come in.

89
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,296
Prepare an explosives package
right away.

90
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,051
- My eggs are cold.
- Put it in the microwave.

91
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,889
- That doesn't sound right.
- The rotor's jammed.

92
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,259
- Borrow that pen for a second?
- Help yourself...

93
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,900
There we go, that's got it.
Here.

94
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,092
- What was wrong with your pen?
- Nothing.

95
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,054
I don't stick it in garbage disposals.

96
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,690
- Fuel report you requested.
- Thanks, Mac.

97
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,699
- You have the duty roster, Snyder?
- It's on your desk, Captain.

98
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,577
- Did you get your work assignments?
- Yeah, I'm on top of it.

99
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,808
- What did Collins say?
- They found a cave under the site.

100
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,889
Did she give you any details?
What was the depth?

101
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,298
She said it was big, Scarpelli,
I don't know.

102
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,414
- Snyder said you found a cavern.
- Yes, under the excavation site.

103
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,136
- I'd like to take a look.
- I ordered them to collapse it.

104
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,336
- This is my only chance to study it.
- Seen one cavern, seen 'em all.

105
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,978
In 1848, the English ship The Valiant
reported that these waters contain...

106
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,696
...a mysterious creature
almost ten metres in length.

107
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,255
That report is pure speculation.

108
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,931
In 1983, a sonarman
aboard a US warship -

109
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,055
- reported sonar contacts
moving with incredible speed.

110
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,811
Operation Deepwell tried to penetrate
the Earth's crust right here in 1963.

111
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,332
They lost drill bits in the cavern,
sent in four divers, no one returned.

112
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,294
We have no idea what type
of marine life we're dealing with!

113
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,572
- I'm too far behind schedule.
- My work is important, too.

114
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,729
Miss Scarpelli, you're young, you've
worked very hard to come here.

115
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,252
Sometimes, in order to get what we
want, we have to make sacrifices.

116
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,975
Once we can prove that a permanent
colony can exist at this depth, -

117
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,298
- we will conduct research
into all areas of marine biology.

118
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,015
Please, you'll have to excuse me.

119
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,569
- You'll have to keep it dry.
- Are you kidding?

120
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,058
I'm in a leaky can
at the bottom of the ocean.

121
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,412
I wouldn't have this shit if we went
topside when we were supposed to.

122
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,693
I know it's a stretch. We'll go up as
soon as the missile site's in place.

123
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,051
When is that?
He's had six months.

124
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,096
Why do the Navy trust this guy to
put up a base? He's not in the Navy.

125
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,011
- He's under a lot of pressure.
- So am I. "Snyder fix this..."

126
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,738
- What would you do without me?
- Probably drown. Get dressed.

127
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,377
I could stay for six months more,
but when you sign on for four, -

128
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,174
- it ought to be four.

129
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,737
- Give it a rest.
- You could do something.

130
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,854
Norris, get me topside. Please.

131
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,528
I'll try.

132
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,334
It's open.

133
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,050
- Captain?
- I'll be right with you. Have a seat.

134
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,257
- Your son?
- Yeah, that's my little Mikey.

135
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:21,057
The artist. I told him it was
beautiful here. Flowers, trees...

136
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,539
- Must be nice having a family.
- It's what keeps me going.

137
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,733
- You anxious to get home?
- Yes, I am.

138
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,376
Now tell me why you came in here.

139
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,935
Could you talk to Van Gelder about
letting me travel to the missile site?

140
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,576
Collins has discovered
these unusual caverns.

141
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,170
But Van Gelder is blowing them up
in order to place the missiles.

142
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,895
If Van Gelder doesn't get
the platform in place this week, -

143
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,058
- the Navy's gonna close the book
on Deepstar.

144
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,252
I've studied these waters
for six months.

145
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,339
We must proceed with caution.
Those caverns need to be checked.

146
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,897
Otherwise, we don't know
what we're getting into.

147
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,049
To be honest with you, I don't care
if they took a shovel to this place.

148
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,617
I have to make sure Van Gelder gets
the site operational before we return.

149
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,257
- I'm sorry.
- I still think it's a big mistake.

150
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,139
Come on!

151
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,339
- Water rationing can be a bitch.
- Very funny.

152
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,577
You'll have to wait 24 hours
to finish showering, -

153
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,889
- unless you persuade someone
to let you use their card.

154
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,538
It's getting cold.

155
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,537
- Let her down. Easy.
- I got it.

156
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,092
Easy. Easy...

157
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,692
You asshole.

158
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,498
Seacat to Seatrak.
Last package in place.

159
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,375
Okay, give me some distance.

160
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,454
That's far enough.

161
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,811
- Let her rip.
- Ready? Fire in the hole.

162
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,970
- The sea floor is giving way.
- Back it up!

163
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,132
You guys all right?

164
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,492
- Yeah, we're okay.
- When I scrape out my drawers.

165
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,535
Prep a remote. I want to see
what you're sitting on.

166
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,053
- Are they serious?
- You heard her. Prep a remote.

167
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,210
Remote batteries up to full.
Motors up, guidance system engaged.

168
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,572
- Camera's on.
- Launch remote.

169
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:22,254
Signal coming through. Seatrak?
Stand by to receive remote signal.

170
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,616
It's like another world.

171
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,730
Under every deep,
a lower deep opens.

172
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,979
- What's that?
- Emerson.

173
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,050
Shit, we should be recording this!
Seacat, I want to run a tape.

174
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,696
- She'll want some stills next.
- Hodges, some stills too.

175
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,414
Start the VCR. Set the stills
for five second intervals.

176
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,331
VCR rolling and recording.
Port and starboard still cameras on.

177
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,216
That wasn't so hard, was it?

178
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,016
We lost the signal.
See if you can fix it.

179
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,176
- We're not getting any signal.
- We're working on it.

180
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,293
Goddamn piece ofjunk!
Better bring it up.

181
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,933
- We lost the remote.
- Not again.

182
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,530
Van Gelder's gonna shit kittens
when he finds out.

183
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,097
"You know how expensive
remotes are?"

184
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,339
- You wanna go after it?
- You mean, just go?

185
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,459
- Standing by.
- Prepare to detach.

186
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,097
- Detach.
- We're away.

187
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,737
Can't wait to show this to Scarpelli.
She's gonna wet her panties.

188
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,534
Underwater volcanoes have been
active here for a long time.

189
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,971
The cavern was probably formed
by a lava bubble.

190
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,935
- Could sea creatures have survived?
- It's possible.

191
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,134
So they could be
thousands of years old?

192
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,697
Let's see what the guys
have picked up on the remote.

193
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,415
- They've detached.
- What are you doing?

194
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,250
- We have trouble with the remote.
- Did you lose it again?

195
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,931
- We're rectifying the situation.
- If you lost it you're in trouble.

196
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,612
What? We're having trouble
with the transmission...

197
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,529
If we get away with this,
it'll be a miracle.

198
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,849
There it is. The remote.

199
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,972
Let's bring it aboard
and get out of here.

200
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,696
- You scared of a few ugly fish?
- This place gives me the creeps.

201
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,495
I just don't like caves.

202
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,852
- Sonar contact, bearing 237.
- Sonar contact? Here?

203
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,972
Contact closer. 300 metres.
250... 150.

204
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,968
I don't see anything.

205
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,650
- Holy shit, I don't believe it!
- Mayday!

206
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,057
- Look at the size of that thing!
- Get us out of here!

207
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,968
What's wrong, Seacat?

208
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,254
Seacat, come in. Do you read?
They're in trouble.

209
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,896
See if you can get a fix on them.

210
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,410
- No contact.
- That's impossible.

211
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,848
Are you telling me
they've disappeared?

212
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,450
- No contact.
- You're sure?

213
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:12,452
Okay, I'm calling Laidlaw.
Deepstar 6, this is Seatrak.

214
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,573
Deepstar 6, this is Seatrak,
come in.

215
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,130
Shit!

216
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,257
I got contact.

217
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,295
I don't think it's Seacat.
It's moving too fast.

218
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,010
- What is it, Collins?
- We've lost contact with Seacat.

219
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,939
- Get me the Captain.
- He's busy.

220
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,418
- Get Laidlaw now, Snyder!
- Yes, ma'am.

221
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,413
Bitch.

222
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,857
- What the hell was that?
- Check the stabilizers. Mayday!

223
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,009
Deepstar, mayday! This is Seatrak!

224
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,057
Stabilizers are out!

225
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,893
Something is pushing us over!

226
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,612
Let me try the switch.

227
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,289
- Here's the Captain, Collins.
- Put her over the speaker.

228
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,135
Say again, Seatrak. This is Deepstar,
please acknowledge.

229
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,336
- Shit! I lost her.
- Trouble?

230
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,977
She called and said she'd lost contact
with Seacat, and now I've lost her.

231
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,890
The transmitter screwed up again.
When is the shift change?

232
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,173
- Fourteen hours.
- I'd better check it out.

233
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,536
- All right, Sport, let's hit it.
- She's ready to roll, Dad.

234
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,254
Close us up.

235
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,617
- Deepstar 6, how do you read?
- Loud and clear.

236
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,017
- Pressure?
- 3.6 and holding.

237
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,814
- Oxygen?
- Oxygen is 4.0.

238
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,614
- Fuel?
- 412 pounds. Pressure steady.

239
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,778
Locking collar?
Umbilicals?

240
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,416
- Check.
- Henway?

241
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,692
- Henway ready.
- What's a henway?

242
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,097
About three to four pounds.

243
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,457
Very funny, assholes. DSRV-2,
you are clear for departure.

244
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,415
- Have a nice day, Snyder.
- I got your nice day right here.

245
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,499
My heart is still beating?
I thought it stopped.

246
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,455
Let me get some of this off you.
What is it?

247
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,017
My legs. I can't move them.

248
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,172
- Bad, huh?
- I've seen worse.

249
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,976
- I don't think so.
- Did you see what hit us?

250
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:36,493
- No. I have no idea.
- I'll see if I can move this.

251
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,855
God, it's too heavy.

252
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,258
You've got to stay awake
until help comes.

253
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,898
- Someone's gonna come for us soon.
- You think I'll make it?

254
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,298
Yeah, hang on. Just keep talking.

255
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,938
At least one good thing will come
out of it. We'll be going home soon.

256
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,215
Seatrak, DSRV-2 here. Do you read?
DSRV-2 to Seatrak.

257
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,978
- Come in, Seatrak.
- They've had hours to fix the radio.

258
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,492
- They couldn't fix a toaster.
- Yeah. I think she's in trouble.

259
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,820
Collins can take care of herself.
Are you ever going to marry her?

260
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,377
- Me, marry Collins? Get outta town!
- She's a great lady.

261
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,859
Tell me something I don't know.
First woman to graduate SEALS.

262
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,416
She's one of the Navy's finest.
She don't need a submarine pilot -

263
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,771
- who's never had more
than a week's pay in his pocket.

264
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,098
Apply to OCS. I've got some pull.
You can make it.

265
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,932
Come on! Can you see me
in an officer's uniform?

266
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,974
No way. I'll just moonlight
till the oil business picks up.

267
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,059
- This is for the birds.
- Fish.

268
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,810
Sonar contact. Bearing, 175.
600 metres, steady.

269
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,774
- What kind of contact?
- I'm not sure.

270
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,098
What the hell's that, a whale?
A sub?

271
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,930
I don't think... Wait a second,
it's changing course.

272
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,089
New bearing, 135.
500 metres, still closing.

273
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,531
- It's heading straight for us.
- What's our speed?

274
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,699
- 12 knots.
- Reduce speed to one-third.

275
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,452
300 metres and still closing.
Christ, look at it move.

276
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,139
All stop.
100 metres.

277
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,374
What the hell is that?
I think we're in big trouble, boss.

278
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,053
- Blow ballast. 100 metres.
- Forward tanks, blow.

279
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,093
Kill the light.

280
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,258
Positive 80. 90...
100 metres.

281
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,096
- It's gone.
- Oh, man!

282
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,851
- I wonder what it was.
- Who knows.

283
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,251
We're on the turnpike.
Bullpen at 500 metres and closing.

284
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,089
Seatrak, this is DSRV-2.
Do you read?

285
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,932
- Jesus, what a mess.
- Seatrak, acknowledge.

286
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:22,134
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

287
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,652
- Can we dock?
- The angle's wrong.

288
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,376
- One bump and she's gone.
- Well, don't bump her, then.

289
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,499
Come on, baby.

290
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,928
Collar's in place. Umbilicals.

291
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:24,932
CO2 is way up. Electrical fire.
She's leaking. Doesn't look good.

292
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,332
- Have we still got a clean dock?
- Clean and tight. Pressure's holding.

293
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,297
My father told me, "Stay at home,
help with the farm, son." Not me.

294
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,176
I had to join the Navy
and see the fucking world. Ready?

295
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,698
Did you hear that?
There it was again.

296
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,451
They're coming.
I told you they'd rescue us.

297
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,299
Oh, God, thank you.

298
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,733
The hatch is jammed.
I'm not getting a green light.

299
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,489
- Looks like the motor shorted out.
- Wanna crank it?

300
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:37,775
I'll see if I can rewire it. We need
power for the lights and instruments.

301
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,496
- Should you be doing that?
- Do I tell you how to drive subs?

302
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,453
As a matter of fact, you do.

303
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,818
Maybe we should use
the crank instead.

304
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:35,258
Thank God.
Burciaga's legs are crushed.

305
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,533
- He can't move.
- I'll get the rope.

306
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,773
- Rope, rope, rope!
- Throw it down here.

307
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,214
Come on...

308
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,459
Ready, Mac? Easy now.

309
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,977
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, buddy.

310
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,650
He's gone.

311
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,449
Move it! She won't hold forever!

312
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,330
You gotta leave him.

313
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,051
Come on! Give me your hand now.

314
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,338
Come on, Mac.

315
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,495
- I'm getting the box!
- Forget it. My back is broken.

316
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,454
- It's stripped.
- Get out, save yourselves.

317
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,256
- The circuit's fried.
- Get out of here! Save yourselves!

318
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,453
That's an order!

319
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,180
No way, man.

320
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,688
PURGE - FLOOD

321
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,611
No!

322
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,050
You cold?

323
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,536
Here, put this on.

324
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,098
Put this on your legs.

325
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,140
It's good to see you guys.

326
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:51,130
- Let's get her warm.
- Put this around her. How are you?

327
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,298
- A little damp.
- Get some dry clothes.

328
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,574
- Let's get you checked out.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

329
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,331
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

330
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:28,775
- I guess it was a stupid question.
- No, thanks for asking.

331
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,849
I know you and the Captain were
a lot closer than everybody else...

332
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:40,090
I liked him a lot. I guess
I just came here to say that.

333
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,691
- I'm going to miss him.
- I know.

334
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,297
Hey,
I thought you may want to have this.

335
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,536
I found that in some of his stuff.

336
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,978
Thanks.

337
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,296
I'll see you up top.

338
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,130
Hodges and Osborne lost the remote
in the cave and went in to get it.

339
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:19,573
That's when they saw something.
The remote, and something else.

340
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:24,729
Something that scared them. Then
they screamed, then they were gone.

341
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,172
- Did you see it?
- No, but the sonar picked it up.

342
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,056
Something very big and very fast.

343
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,254
Were there lights on the remote?
Were the Seatrak's work lights on?

344
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,293
- Yeah, why?
- Stay put.

345
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,890
Ever heard of photomigration?

346
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,572
It's a theory of aggressive animal
behaviour associated with light.

347
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,489
Topside approved your request
for extraction.

348
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,932
Get Snyder to secure the station
and prep the DSRV for departure.

349
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,610
- We're going home.
- Amen.

350
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,014
What was that?

351
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,176
That was our baby's heartbeat.

352
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,454
Well... I'm gonna go check
on Snyder and Richardson.

353
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:50,169
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought it was only my concern.

354
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,454
- I didn't want it to be a problem.
- I can't believe you didn't tell me.

355
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:03,576
You always say you're a drifter,
and you don't want to settle down.

356
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,779
What do you say if it's a boy
we name it after the Captain?

357
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,331
Philip Laidlaw McBride.

358
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,935
I like that.

359
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:51,171
Well... Sorry to piss on your picnic,
but Norris wants you on deck.

360
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,018
Now.

361
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,380
DSRV-2 is prepped and ready to go.

362
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,335
Pack your gear and tell the others
to stand by for decompression.

363
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,175
- What about the missile sled?
- I don't plan to do anything.

364
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,931
I just got the retraction order,
the Navy can send a recovery team.

365
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,337
All I'm asking you is to secure
the missile sled.

366
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,694
- What's the procedure, Snyder?
- Only the Captain can order it.

367
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,334
I thought we were beginning
decompression.

368
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,452
That's postponed until we secure
the missiles.

369
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:36,337
- It's not like people can steal them.
- Snyder, please. Just do it.

370
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,373
- Fine.
- Do you want me to assist you?

371
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,413
I think I can handle it.

372
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,336
REQUEST PROCEDURE TO SECURE
ABANDONED MISSILE SLED

373
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:13,895
DEFINE ABANDONED
A. FOR REPAIR OR REMOVAL

374
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:19,379
B. TO NATURAL FORCES
C. TO AGGRESSION

375
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:29,217
This thing that attacked you, was it
a natural force, or aggression?

376
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,890
- I don't know what you mean.
- The computer wants to know.

377
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,092
It was aggressive action
by a force unknown.

378
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,249
- Just get on with it.
- I'm just checking, okay?

379
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,419
Pardon my ass all the way to hell.

380
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,850
Okay, aggression.

381
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,419
EMERGENCY DETONATION

382
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,817
- What will you do topside?
- I'm heading right for Big Lew's.

383
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,457
Big Lew's Burger Barn. The greasiest
hamburgerjoint in the universe.

384
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,812
I walk right in
and order a double fistful of meat.

385
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,218
With cheese. Bucket of fries,
and a very large chocolate shake.

386
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:11,459
I spent six months trying
to keep you on a healthy diet.

387
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,050
You hear my arteries hardening?

388
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,771
- Where's Van Gelder?
- Up gathering his homework.

389
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:44,379
Search release.
Damn command directive...

390
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,731
It's not gonna be my ass, I tell you.

391
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,773
Seven, eight...

392
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,092
Okay, boys and girls,
don't try this at home.

393
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,690
- What the hell's that?
- What the fuck?

394
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,658
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

395
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,169
You idiot! What have you done?
You detonated the missile sled!

396
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,578
- I secured the missile sled!
- You signed our death warrants.

397
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,978
You know how much water detonating
a 20 megaton warhead displaces?

398
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,492
- What are those?
- Concussion waves. Jesus.

399
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,852
- They're registering force 20.
- Here it comes.

400
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,935
Snyder, damage control!
Get me the diagnostic.

401
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,452
Stand by!
Switch to VSL overlap.

402
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,777
- Binary status.
- Overlap.

403
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,255
FLP fraction.

404
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,611
Revert to load unit.
System C!

405
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,574
I'm on stand-by power,
good for two minutes only.

406
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,695
- I'm losing the sensors.
- Try patching a bypass.

407
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:39,736
- I got a fire over here.
- There's four warning lights.

408
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,931
Structural deficiency.
Docking bay, aft.

409
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,495
I'm on it.

410
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,498
McBride, let's go! We got a leak.
The main strut may go.

411
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,933
Bring it up! That's good.

412
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,052
Get the extender real quick.

413
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,451
Put it up there.
Crank it up.

414
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,732
I'm switching on auxiliary.
I'm on count.

415
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,452
Crank it up!

416
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,136
Pull it!

417
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,696
You've got to weld this
to the base plate!

418
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,529
I got the flap!

419
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:17,248
- Slow down.
- We're getting close.

420
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,373
Norris! Shut down the water main!

421
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,611
One more! About two inches.

422
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,213
That's good.

423
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,733
All right, it's done.

424
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,049
Run a diagnostic.

425
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,730
Crew's quarters are flooded,
power shortage in section...

426
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,491
Hold it. The oxygen filtration
system's wrecked.

427
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,850
So the air supply is gone?

428
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,450
The main lines to
the decompression bay are ruptured.

429
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,892
- So we're not going anywhere.
- How much air do we have?

430
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:11,128
- Seven, eight hours maybe.
- Air is not the main problem.

431
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,379
The cooling primary to the reactor
was destroyed.

432
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,619
- It'll go supercritical soon.
- What happens when it does?

433
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,496
- It'll explode.
- Welcome to ground zero.

434
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,659
Snyder? Can you fix the radio?

435
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,409
Sure, if I had the right parts,
and a week to do it.

436
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:37,171
- Why don't we use the escape pod?
- Because we can't decompress.

437
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,940
We can't leave the station.

438
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,018
Snyder will get in the
Guinness Book of Records.

439
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,213
Causing two nuclear explosions
in one afternoon has to be a record!

440
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,572
- I followed procedure!
- You fucked up!

441
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:03,052
Look at this. Can't we repair
the lines to the decompression bay?

442
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:08,254
- They are too badly damaged.
- We might be able to run a bypass.

443
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:14,530
You mean seal the rupture here?
Run a line from the medical lab, -

444
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:20,133
- patch it into the airlock pressure
system... Bring up the blueprints.

445
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:28,297
- BZN 17 through RTX 56.
- Yes. It might work.

446
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,697
We've patched that in
from JVB-124, right?

447
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,016
It connects the decompression
chamber to the lab.

448
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:45,340
- Did you fit the converter coupler?
- No, I reversed the old coupler.

449
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,818
Clever, Snyder. When you've got it
connected, give us a hand downstairs.

450
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,810
That ought to do it.

451
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,410
- Be careful.
- It's a walk in the park.

452
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,056
McBride! Have you got the fitting in?

453
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,218
Leave it off until Richardson
repairs the outside line.

454
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,651
Ready for a video check.

455
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,258
Video checks out.

456
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,135
- I need a hard copy of LH 34.
- Coming up.

457
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,729
Right, kids, let's make it happen.

458
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,496
Clear. Let's try it.

459
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,017
Richardson has to seal
the leak here.

460
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:12,259
Then you patch in the bypass
to the decompression chamber.

461
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,449
All set to get wet.

462
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,179
- I'm ready, let her rip.
- She's ripping.

463
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:51,680
I'm clear of the airlock.

464
01:01:18,368 --> 01:01:21,997
I see the rupture.
Where do I patch in?

465
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:28,158
- Find ENZ 6538.
- Hook up at ENZ 6538.

466
01:01:34,008 --> 01:01:36,522
I got it.

467
01:01:56,488 --> 01:01:59,560
- Is he patched in yet?
- Richardson, are you patched in?

468
01:01:59,768 --> 01:02:03,841
Almost there.
I think that's got it.

469
01:02:12,168 --> 01:02:14,762
Hold it.

470
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:20,924
- What's the problem, Richardson?
- I saw something.

471
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:26,763
- Say again, please.
- What is this?

472
01:02:26,968 --> 01:02:29,801
His transmission's broke up.
Stand by.

473
01:02:33,408 --> 01:02:37,447
Tell him to get back
to the airlock right away.

474
01:02:37,648 --> 01:02:40,526
- Do you copy?
- Shut off the outside lights.

475
01:02:40,728 --> 01:02:44,607
- What about the lights on the suit?
- Not from up here.

476
01:02:57,488 --> 01:03:00,207
Okay, up!

477
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:10,322
Relax, pal,
we'll have you up in two seconds.

478
01:03:10,528 --> 01:03:13,679
He's down here, pull me out!

479
01:03:16,048 --> 01:03:20,564
There's something in the airlock.
God damn it!

480
01:03:35,408 --> 01:03:37,797
Jim!

481
01:03:40,128 --> 01:03:42,722
Close the inside hatch!

482
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:50,518
- Snyder, the inside hatch!
- I got it.

483
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:59,127
- It's blown!
- Scarpelli! Hit the override.

484
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,359
I got the plug in.

485
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:13,806
McBride, come on!

486
01:04:38,928 --> 01:04:43,365
Jesus. Oh, God!

487
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:52,166
Stop, McBride!

488
01:04:57,328 --> 01:05:00,206
Go! Come on, move!

489
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,244
Let us in!

490
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,962
What the hell are you doing?

491
01:05:17,048 --> 01:05:20,757
- It got Scarpelli.
- Oh, my God.

492
01:05:22,288 --> 01:05:27,123
You son of a bitch!
We ought feed you to that thing!

493
01:05:32,248 --> 01:05:34,921
It's coming up!

494
01:05:36,528 --> 01:05:41,283
- You think the hatch will hold?
- Snyder, reactor status.

495
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:47,762
In four hours, eleven minutes and
45 seconds the place will blow up.

496
01:05:47,968 --> 01:05:52,996
- The escape pod is our only chance.
- Don't be an idiot. We'll burst.

497
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:57,406
Don't you call me an idiot! If not
for you, we'd be decompressing now!

498
01:05:57,608 --> 01:06:00,759
Knock it off! Listen...

499
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:06,441
It stopped.

500
01:06:06,648 --> 01:06:10,323
We're gonna have to go
back down there.

501
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:15,363
With that thing down there, we
won't get anywhere near the bypass.

502
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:19,607
See what weapons you can find.
I'll see to Van Gelder.

503
01:06:21,088 --> 01:06:23,477
Let's go, Snyder.

504
01:06:26,928 --> 01:06:30,284
- There's a couple of M12's here.
- M12's ain't gonna kill it.

505
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:35,357
- That thing was fucking big.
- We're just trying to hold it back.

506
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:38,207
That thing killed half our crew,
I want it dead.

507
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:41,923
Fucking A nothing! You ran like a
rabbit when it went for Richardson.

508
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:45,598
You saw that thing!
What was I supposed to do?

509
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:48,561
We needed your help.

510
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:55,367
Look, I was scared shitless, okay?
I wasn't thinking.

511
01:06:55,568 --> 01:06:58,401
We're all scared.

512
01:07:03,128 --> 01:07:05,722
Come on.

513
01:07:09,088 --> 01:07:12,558
Here, hold this.

514
01:07:14,968 --> 01:07:20,964
John, I've got to get those people
out of here. I can't do it alone.

515
01:07:21,168 --> 01:07:25,446
- What can I do?
- Can you tell me what that thing is?

516
01:07:25,648 --> 01:07:31,803
Some form of arthropod. But very big.
I've never seen anything like it.

517
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:35,205
It might be one of Scarpelli's
cave dwellers.

518
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:37,160
- Can we kill it?
- I don't know.

519
01:07:45,248 --> 01:07:49,400
- You know how to handle those?
- Of course I do.

520
01:07:59,688 --> 01:08:04,045
- How you feeling?
- Fine. Thanks for asking.

521
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:09,003
- You got the guns. Good.
- And the shark darts.

522
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:13,804
It's loaded with a CO2 cartridge.
You stick the point in, -

523
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:16,920
- the thing blows up like a balloon.

524
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:21,201
Hold it. These cartridges
expired six months ago.

525
01:08:21,408 --> 01:08:25,287
- The fucking thing's out of date.
- Snyder, it works.

526
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:29,083
I'm not going down
with that defective piece of shit!

527
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:36,727
Okay, it works.

528
01:08:49,728 --> 01:08:54,199
The whole place is filled.
That thing could be anywhere.

529
01:08:56,288 --> 01:09:01,885
The Navy. It's notjust ajob,
it's an adventure.

530
01:09:20,128 --> 01:09:24,246
- What are you doing, McBride?
- Strobes.

531
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:28,521
Scarpelli said something about light.
Photo something...

532
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:34,007
Photomigration. Marine animals are
attracted to light as a food source.

533
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:38,998
- It has a hard-on for light. So what?
- Don't you get it?

534
01:09:40,448 --> 01:09:43,042
Light means lunch.

535
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:38,483
- He's left.
- Are you sure?

536
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah. I'll go patch in the bypass.

537
01:11:22,928 --> 01:11:25,567
Almost got it.

538
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:48,960
I got it patched in.
Let's get the hell out of here.

539
01:12:21,768 --> 01:12:24,328
Close the door!

540
01:12:26,328 --> 01:12:30,116
Did you see what happened
to Van Gelder?

541
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:38,121
What the fuck are you looking at?

542
01:12:48,048 --> 01:12:52,838
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

543
01:12:53,048 --> 01:12:56,961
What happened to Van Gelder
was not my fault.

544
01:12:57,168 --> 01:13:01,127
- You stay the fuck away from me!
- All right.

545
01:13:01,328 --> 01:13:06,356
- I did everything by the book!
- Get my kit.

546
01:13:08,168 --> 01:13:11,126
We don't have time for this.

547
01:13:11,328 --> 01:13:13,888
I didn't kill Van Gelder.

548
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:18,604
- No one's blaming you.
- Yes, you are! For the missiles.

549
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:24,644
You blame me for killing Richardson,
killing Scarpelli. Now Van Gelder...

550
01:13:28,288 --> 01:13:30,848
What are you doing?

551
01:13:31,048 --> 01:13:34,757
- It's just to calm you down.
- No shots! No fucking way!

552
01:13:34,968 --> 01:13:37,528
We have to calm you down.

553
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:44,921
- No!
- Take it easy, I'll let you go.

554
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:59,279
- I didn't kill him.
- I know.

555
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:05,442
- It's gonna be all right. Come on.
- He's really lost it.

556
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:11,200
- I'm not surprised.
- Is he going to be all right?

557
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:16,357
I hope so. I really do.

558
01:14:20,648 --> 01:14:24,926
- We gotta get going.
- I know.

559
01:14:25,968 --> 01:14:30,086
We'll patch the escape pod
and the decompression chamber.

560
01:14:30,288 --> 01:14:34,406
- You got some supplies?
- Yeah. Go on.

561
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:37,918
We'll meet you in the escape pod.

562
01:14:42,688 --> 01:14:48,081
I have to pack some food.
You sit right here.

563
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:17,198
Snyder. Snyder!

564
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:24,517
You bastard!
You wouldn't even die!

565
01:15:56,168 --> 01:16:00,525
Snyder, what are you doing?
Stop it!

566
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:14,922
You have to decompress first!

567
01:16:16,128 --> 01:16:21,202
Don't be a fool!
You'll kill us all!

568
01:16:22,688 --> 01:16:24,883
Look out!

569
01:16:29,848 --> 01:16:32,237
Fuck it.

570
01:16:47,848 --> 01:16:49,884
Come on!

571
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:58,082
The other way.

572
01:17:08,048 --> 01:17:13,361
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
- He's already dead.

573
01:18:00,168 --> 01:18:03,444
The Command Center
is completely flooded.

574
01:18:05,368 --> 01:18:10,726
- Shit, the system's shorting out.
- Can you pull up the reactor status?

575
01:18:10,928 --> 01:18:13,442
In a minute.

576
01:18:16,048 --> 01:18:20,041
Three hours and 43 minutes.
Barely enough to decompress.

577
01:18:20,248 --> 01:18:25,163
- I can't catch my breath.
- The air's almost gone.

578
01:18:45,408 --> 01:18:48,639
Will you marry me?

579
01:18:50,168 --> 01:18:54,559
I'd marry anyone who'd get me
out of this mess.

580
01:18:54,768 --> 01:18:57,407
Done.

581
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:13,486
The decompression chamber works.

582
01:19:13,688 --> 01:19:18,398
But without the mini-sub,
we're trapped.

583
01:19:19,928 --> 01:19:25,241
I'll swim across and bring the DSRV-1
to the decompression chamber.

584
01:19:25,448 --> 01:19:30,442
There must be another way.
That thing is still out there.

585
01:20:52,568 --> 01:20:57,084
I've always asked for the strength
to do your will, God.

586
01:20:57,288 --> 01:21:00,837
And I need your help now.

587
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:07,643
I don't understand. I'm so scared.

588
01:21:10,968 --> 01:21:15,120
Please let McBride make it.

589
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:18,126
Please let my baby live.

590
01:21:42,888 --> 01:21:46,961
Damn it, McBride, hurry up.

591
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:52,879
He'll get the sub, I know he will.
And we're going to get topside.

592
01:21:54,048 --> 01:21:56,323
Right.

593
01:21:58,648 --> 01:22:04,200
Will you visit me on my farm in
New Hampshire? Sit on the porch, -

594
01:22:04,408 --> 01:22:08,083
- listen to the trees.

595
01:22:08,728 --> 01:22:12,357
Smell the mountain air.

596
01:22:24,688 --> 01:22:29,045
- Oh God, it's McBride.
- Maybe he's stuck.

597
01:23:14,848 --> 01:23:19,239
Collins!
Get in the decompression chamber!

598
01:23:19,448 --> 01:23:23,964
- It won't open.
- It takes 30 seconds to pressurize.

599
01:23:31,928 --> 01:23:33,998
Quiet.

600
01:23:54,608 --> 01:23:57,918
It's in here, I know it is.

601
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:55,560
- We've got to help her!
- Take this, you sack of fish shit!

602
01:25:27,568 --> 01:25:29,524
God!

603
01:25:33,248 --> 01:25:36,479
There's nothing we could have done.

604
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:51,477
REACTOR STATUS CRITICAL IN

605
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:03,765
McBride, wake up. It's time.

606
01:26:16,408 --> 01:26:18,876
Hatch secured.

607
01:26:20,568 --> 01:26:23,605
Ready to detach.

608
01:26:24,968 --> 01:26:27,277
We better hurry.

609
01:26:42,648 --> 01:26:48,041
Hold on. Shock waves.
Impact in three, two, one...

610
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:54,480
- Set stabilizers on full.
- Hard climb.

611
01:27:02,528 --> 01:27:07,238
We're losing starboard drive.
She's not holding.

612
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:13,963
- We're taking on too much water.
- I'll see what I can do.

613
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:17,717
The ballast control circuit's dead.

614
01:27:17,928 --> 01:27:20,522
All right,
I'm gonna drop both tanks.

615
01:27:20,728 --> 01:27:24,960
- We won't be able to stay afloat.
- It won't matter if we don't make it.

616
01:27:29,648 --> 01:27:35,803
- It's working. We're rising.
- It's okay.

617
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:43,558
- I think we're going to make it.
- I know we will.

618
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:16,960
We're here.

619
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:30,158
- Abandon ship.
- My pleasure.

620
01:29:24,608 --> 01:29:27,964
No! Don't do it!

621
01:29:37,608 --> 01:29:39,678
McBride!

622
01:30:40,048 --> 01:30:43,085
McBride!

623
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,768
Thank you.
