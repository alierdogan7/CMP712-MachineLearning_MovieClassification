00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:08,039
Last week, my best friend came back
to life. The day before, he died.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,279
A few days before that, he emerges
as the most powerful member

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,199
of this tribe called the Angelics.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,760
He acquires magical powers
they didn't even think was possible.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,039
People used to think he was mad.
They were wrong. He's special.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,559
But him being special's
been a tumultuous time.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,519
And that's not even half of it!
There's these dead people...

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,119
the Fades ... and they're
trying to come back to life,

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,439
led by this dude called John,

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,679
who died in 1943 and has come back
to life by eating human flesh.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,799
And now he's got a taste for it,
he just can't stop. Yeah, I know.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,639
He tricked Paul into helping him rescue
this girl, Natalie, from the Angelics.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,839
And with her help, he's bringing a whole
army of dead people back into our town.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,119
We've got to fight. Meanwhile,
the Angelics have their own plan.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,879
How?
By having one of our team on theirs.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,439
Those of us in the middle of it ...
me, my history teacher,

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,959
Paul's mum, Paul's sister, Paul's
girlfriend ... just stick out our chin,

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,079
grin and try and pretend we
understand what's going on. Scary.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,559
Now, who's seen my Matrix box set?

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,279
I'm pretty sure I've worked out
who the Architect is a metaphor for.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,719
Na-Nu, Na-Nu.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,240
HE BREATHES LUSTFULLY

23
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,959
I've been waiting for over an hour!

24
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,439
'For those with
missing persons enquiries,

25
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,839
'a crisis centre has been set up
at St Barnabus School.

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,200
'I repeat, a missing persons crisis
centre has been set up at the school.'

27
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,440
THEY LAUGH

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,639
I don't even know if he's all right
or if he should be here!

29
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,919
The doctor didn't even
want to discharge you.

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,280
I am allowed to be worried.
He's fine. Watch this.

31
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,719
Lord Of The Rings.

32
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,279
Why don't they just fly in and out of
Mordor on the back of a giant eagle?

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,479
Boom! They didn't want to
discharge him because he's too well.

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,959
That's ridiculous.
Mission Impossible 2.

35
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,900
Cruise finds a face
mask of the bodyguard

36
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,839
without having seen or met him?

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,880
Likely(!) Kaboosh.

38
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:47,439
Very few people actually come out of
a coma healthier. It's... odd.

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,839
My name is Dr Mac the Movie Doctor and
I pronounce a clear bill of health.

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
He's got a good recall
of basic facts. "Basic facts"?

41
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,679
The Matrix.

42
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,519
'This is Steve... '

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,039
Where do I start? Direct hit.

44
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,199
Steve! Call me back!
Boom! Ssh! Boom!

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,440
Home run.

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,440
"Got well soon."

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
See what you've done there.

48
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm OK, Mum. Good to have you home.

49
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,680
Steve's still not
answering my calls.

50
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,279
Yeah, the school's going to be
a secondary location,

51
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,599
we're completely swamped
on missing persons.

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,919
Armstrong wouldn't know a suspect
if one bit him on the arse.

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,240
Look, Carol, I need to go, right?

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,199
Hello.

55
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Hello.

56
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,440
KNOCK ON DOOR

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,439
We come in peace.

58
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
Oh, do you now?

59
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,240
That must be nice.

60
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
Sarah?!

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,799
So why are you here? Paul's back.

62
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
What?

63
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,679
Back from the dead? Sarah?

64
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,079
Are you OK? So has he eaten, then?

65
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,599
No, He hasn't eaten.
He just... came back.

66
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,599
He closed an ascension point but..
The point's closed?

67
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,680
That's what happened, isn't it, eh?
Sarah...

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,599
Sarah's eaten, hasn't she?

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,999
Hasn't she? It was my idea.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,639
At least we're trying
for a solution to this mess.

71
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,559
Sarah eats, she'll be reborn.

72
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,999
Immortal, just like him. The boy,
he came back. The boy's the answer!

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,238
The answer to what?

74
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,480
People have died.

75
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,280
The boy's a joke.

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,319
We can beat them, we need to try.

77
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,519
With Sarah's help
we can start to fight back.

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,719
You're going to destroy her, Neil.
I'm not staying to watch.

79
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,079
RUMBLING AND RATTLING

80
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,760
What's happening?

81
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,040
I don't know.

82
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
Must be him.

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,680
We've got to get
everyone out of here.

84
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,639
We've got two more.

85
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,599
Good.

86
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
I love this.

87
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,280
I love you.

88
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,760
I've never been happier
than I am right now.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
Thank you...

90
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,959
for what you did.

91
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,519
Tried and failed to save you?

92
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,159
Tried and failed to save me.

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Pleasure. I came back from the dead.

94
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,999
What I am, who I am
has got to mean something.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,760
It probably does.

96
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,919
MAC SPITS AND GARGLES

97
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,640
I was ready to ascend.

98
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,119
I'd let everyone down,

99
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,000
and I was ready to leave this...

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,759
rock for ever.

101
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
so you came back to life.

102
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,960
But can you do this?

103
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,799
Can you though? No. Can you?

104
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,679
Well, then you're nothing to me.

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,999
THEY LAUGH

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Shut up!

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,919
Paul.

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,839
Don't tell anyone but there's
a real live girl in your room.

109
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,679
Are you wearing identical pyjamas?

110
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah, they were... they were
the only two I had clean.

111
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,360
Likely story.

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,640
So your mum was pretty clear
I should sleep in Anna's room.

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,879
Yeah.

114
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,719
But I don't want to.

115
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,760
No?

116
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
Oh. I get it.

117
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,719
Oh, don't mind me.
I'll just be quiet in the corner.

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,040
You do anything you want to.
I won't listen or watch.

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,520
Sofa downstairs it is. Yeah.

120
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,999
Night.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
Night.

122
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,439
You're not even scarred.

123
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,759
The doctor thinks me
a medical miracle.

124
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,800
The doctor thinks you're a freak.

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,080
You're my freak, though.

126
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,240
Yeah.

127
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,759
You... Are you the man in charge?
How did you get in here?

128
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,359
You need to get everyone out
of town. It's not safe.

129
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,279
Full scale evacuation? Great!
You're just what I need(!)

130
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,359
You need to leave. Now. You're
going to die here. All of you!

131
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,999
If you don't get out,
you'll be arrested, understand?

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,839
Men with power. You think you can
scare me, you little, little man?

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,439
I'm actually average height.

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,359
Any news on Clement?

135
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,400
Nothing.

136
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,520
When do we add him to that?

137
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,159
What now?

138
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,120
There's only one thing to do,
we've got to try and find Paul, eh?

139
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,080
Alice?

140
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,920
Rargh!

141
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
What's she?

142
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,080
The girlfriend?

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,119
Yeah.

144
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,160
Pretty.

145
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,959
Neil, what are you doing here?

146
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,040
BREATHES HEAVILY

147
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
'You were dead.'

148
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:15,839
I know. And now you're back.

149
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Alice thinks
that makes you important.

150
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,519
What do you think?

151
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,039
Oh, I think I should have a knife
at your throat right now.

152
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,960
SHE SHIVERS

153
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,279
Why did you do it?

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,599
Why did you help him?
He promised he wouldn't hurt you.

155
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,520
And you believed him?

156
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,480
A murderer?
You were cutting Natalie up.

157
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,680
You were torturing her.

158
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,679
He told me that's what the Angelics
had always done.

159
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,079
Suppressed, policed.

160
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,720
That's what I believed.

161
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,360
What we did, we did for
the good of everyone.

162
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,119
We thought they could be dangerous.
It turns out, we were right.

163
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,400
GROWLING

164
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,960
SHE PANTS

165
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,400
The past is a hole
and it's full of what-ifs.

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,599
And I live in the present.

167
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,519
You? Don't know where you live.

168
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,879
You confuse me.

169
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,320
GROWLING

170
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
HER NECK CRUNCHES

171
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,919
'One thing I do know... '

172
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,800
is that you are going to matter.

173
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,640
And when we find out why that is...

174
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,680
you'll have to pick a side.

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,120
Just make sure
you pick the right side, kid.

176
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,520
SHE BREATHES HUNGRILY

177
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,720
BLOOD DRIPS

178
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,320
Hello, Sarah.

179
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,280
Welcome.

180
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,759
I can't...

181
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
You want to.

182
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,399
One time, during the war...

183
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,719
I was fighting alongside this NCO
called Richard... something.

184
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,239
They brought a man
with his guts ripped out

185
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,040
into the hole that we were in.

186
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,679
Then someone shouted
for medical support...

187
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,319
and Richard raised his hand
in the air

188
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,600
"I'm a medic."

189
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,399
And then I watched him...

190
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,519
as he went and held
this man's guts together

191
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,560
and then watched him till he died.

192
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,639
And afterwards I said to him,

193
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,080
"Richard, I didn't know
that you were a medic."

194
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,360
And he turned to me and he said...

195
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,920
"I'm not.

196
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,359
"I just wanted to know what
the insides of a man felt like."

197
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,880
SHE PANTS

198
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,600
Urges are OK.

199
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,360
They're human.

200
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,519
Just eat.

201
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
And you'll be reborn.

202
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,840
Don't fight it, Sarah. We win.

203
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,399
SHE FEEDS NOISILY

204
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,440
Sarah?

205
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,960
Sarah! Oh...

206
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,200
WIND HOWLS

207
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,239
GLASS SHATTERS

208
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
Oh, shit. Mum?

209
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,239
MUM!

210
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,120
HE SNARLS

211
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,320
HE PANTS

212
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,920
Bad dream?

213
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,360
Yeah.

214
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,800
I didn't wet the bed, though,
so that's a bonus.

215
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,119
We're going to school. Are we?
They've set up a crisis centre.

216
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,799
Steve's not answering my calls.

217
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,119
I think he's missing and Mum says
she'll drive me but only if you come.

218
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
Paul, I'm not asking. I'm telling!

219
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,080
I don't know whether there's
enough people...

220
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,599
Hi. Excuse me?
My name's Mark Etches.

221
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,159
I was told to report to you.

222
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,599
Not unless you're in need of help
and guidance you weren't.

223
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,039
Peter. Peter Tremlett. Doctor.

224
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,399
I'll be running
a counselling service.

225
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,079
Right. Well, thanks for coming in, Mark.
We're going to need everyone we can get.

226
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,519
Now, let's see if we can find someone
to show Mark around, all right?

227
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,480
OK.

228
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,879
You really don't have to show me
everywhere, you know. I want to.

229
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,319
And just round here, we're starting up
an online database of missing persons.

230
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,279
Steve? What you doing here?

231
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,999
Didn't you know?

232
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,039
I'm dead civic-minded, sir.
I work with the elderly, too.

233
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,959
Wiping their arses and everything.

234
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,159
We've actually had a remarkably good
response to our request for volunteers.

235
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
I've got a clipboard and all.

236
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,159
Hi, hello. We're looking
for missing persons.

237
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,639
Who are you missing?
Steve. Steve McEwan. Steve?

238
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,759
He's not missing. He's a volunteer.

239
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,040
Steve's a volunteer? He's helping
with the online databasing.

240
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,480
Anna, wait. Anna!

241
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,920
I think I could be of more use here.

242
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,680
Yes, join me.

243
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,559
Hello, stranger.

244
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,920
Oh... Hello, stranger still.

245
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,040
Surprised to see you here.

246
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
My housemate's mum has gone missing.

247
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm... moral support.

248
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,879
Is your wife still missing?

249
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,120
Um...

250
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Pretty much officially dead.

251
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,159
Pink suits you.

252
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,359
SHE LAUGHS

253
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,479
What's so funny?

254
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,119
What? What's so funny?

255
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,799
Sorry, who are you? Oh, Vicky,
this is... Dr Tremlett, right?

256
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,199
No, no, no, sorry.
I'm just kind of interested...

257
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,679
in what's so funny right now, yeah?

258
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,599
It was just a private joke.

259
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,839
Yeah, and we're actually quite busy,
so unless you want something?

260
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,799
Yeah.

261
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,519
Yeah, I want something.

262
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,119
Oh!

263
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,279
Oof.

264
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,840
Argh!

265
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,680
"Volunteering"?

266
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,839
He's seen some opportunity to
seek out some new pussy, more like.

267
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,959
If I had you, I'd never let you go.

268
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,000
In order for you to
have me, I'd have to be

269
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,039
gagged, blindfolded and
locked in a chest.

270
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,320
That could be arranged.

271
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,600
Why's this door locked?

272
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,279
Oh, speak of the fucking devil.
Where have you been?

273
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,559
Being a devil, I guess.
Are you dribbling?!

274
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,359
Course I am.
I've missed you, sweetness.

275
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,799
Tch! Does that work?
Does that work in your head?

276
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,700
"Haven't seen my
girlfriend in days, I'll

277
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,599
flob on myself and
she'll forgive me."

278
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,839
Anna. Stop. That's not normal dribble.
He's one of them. One of what?

279
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,959
Yeah, one of what?
Don't come any closer. Or what?

280
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,039
He's my boyfriend.
Yeah, and now he's dead.

281
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,820
He used to be dead, now
he's come back to life!

282
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:46,599
What?! Babe, that's not true.

283
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,280
Anna, trust me.
He wants to kill you.

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,160
Go.

285
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,879
Steve, what the fuck are you doing?

286
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,120
Steve?

287
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,000
HE CHUCKLES

288
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,000
THUD AND SCREAM

289
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,759
Have to keep feeding...

290
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,719
Sarah. Sarah!
They're coming for them so quickly.

291
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,839
Sarah. It's me.
Sarah, Where were you?

292
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,279
We need to keep killing.

293
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,920
They can only eat flesh.

294
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,519
What did you see? Did you find him?

295
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,480
I've done... It's OK, you'll be fine.

296
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:49,879
Some things.
Tell me where you've been.

297
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,719
Sarah, you're going to be fine.
Listen to me. It hurt. So bad...

298
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,399
Too badly. I know it did.

299
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,080
There were bodies. So much blood.

300
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,280
Why is every door... locked?!

301
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,999
Steve's dead? My boyfriend's dead?!

302
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,519
Surely more important
is the fact that he's a zombie?

303
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,560
He was dead. Now he's not.
That makes him a zombie.

304
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:14,599
It's more complicated than that.

305
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,300
In fact, you were dead
and now you're not.

306
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,999
Makes you a sort of zombie.

307
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
Mac, this is real.
This is dangerous. This...

308
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,600
There you go.

309
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,719
So, er...
so your children are at this school?

310
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,839
Yeah, Paul and Anna Roberts.

311
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,839
Anna, well, you've met her.

312
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,639
She's loud. Paul...

313
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,719
Well...

314
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,639
Well, he's...

315
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,880
Paul's quieter.

316
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
More contemplative.

317
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,280
If you ever want to talk
to anyone, Dr Tremlett

318
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:58,319
runs a counselling
service in the gym.

319
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,640
OK, thank you.

320
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,040
What are you doing with us?
We... are...

321
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,840
keeping you.

322
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,880
Keeping us for what?

323
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,280
Keeping us for what?!

324
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,600
A WOMAN SCREAMS

325
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,880
THE SCREAMING CONTINUES

326
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,560
Come on!

327
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,840
THEY GASP

328
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,359
How'd you know where the key was?

329
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,199
I volunteer here sometimes.

330
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,599
You're a library monitor?

331
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,320
My boyfriend's dead,
and you're a library monitor?

332
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,919
Paul, what the fuck
has happened to Steve?

333
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,479
What is he?

334
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
If I make an educated guess,

335
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,799
he died, OK?

336
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,119
He became a ghost.

337
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,860
A Fade.
Then this guy called John, he's

338
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:55,599
from the 1940s, he used
to be a Fade ghost,

339
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,319
he's probably taught him how to
eat flesh and grow a new body.

340
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,679
This is serious, Paul.
I am being serious.

341
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,520
We are in so much danger.
Trap him or something.

342
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,359
You ain't afraid of no ghost.

343
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,759
No, no, you're mental.
You're both mental.

344
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,839
Steve's mental, you're mental...

345
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,319
and Jay's a fucking library monitor!

346
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,239
I'm sorry, Anna. My brother?

347
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,879
My stupid pissing brother?

348
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,759
Little pig, little pig, let me in!

349
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,799
Anna, let me in!
Let me in right now.

350
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,239
BANGING
That's it. That's it.

351
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,319
Dad, Dad?
Aw, it's gone to answerphone.

352
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,519
The one time having a dad who's a
policeman might be useful. School. Now!

353
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,720
There's...

354
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,279
Fuck.

355
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,599
I'm going to rip your fucking
head off and spit down your neck.

356
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,159
I'm not afraid of you, Steve.

357
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,980
No-one could be that scary
with a dick your size!

358
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:54,799
We're going to die here.

359
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,279
I knew this would happen.
Death before life.

360
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,119
I'm going to die and I haven't
even felt a breast in my hand.

361
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,759
Haven't even seen a breast.

362
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,799
That's your excuse
to flash me, by the way.

363
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,959
Flash this! Hmm.

364
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,519
We need weapons.

365
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,640
Weapons are no use.

366
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,759
Can't kill them. They're immortal.

367
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,119
I don't even know
how many there are.

368
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,340
What about Mum?
She's still in the hall.

369
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,559
We need to get out of
here, get back to her.

370
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,640
Shit, fuck, shit.
Paul, what are we going to do?

371
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,440
Right. Who's first?

372
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,600
Me!

373
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,160
That's for scaring my... Argh!

374
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,359
See? Now he's de...

375
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,839
This is your mess. I shouldn't be
cleaning up your mess!

376
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,239
He'll be back. Let's go.

377
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,239
Where's Jay?

378
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,160
Jay. Jay?

379
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,399
Jay? Jay?

380
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,039
Jay? Jay?

381
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,559
Jay!

382
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,680
SHE GROANS

383
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,880
Ah!

384
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,439
You have 30 seconds to tell me
everything I need to know about Paul.

385
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,159
Start with what he can do.
He came back for a reason.

386
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,320
To stop you. Wrong answer.

387
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,999
Me?

388
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,199
No, take one of the others.
I can be useful.

389
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,159
I can be useful,
I can show you where things are.

390
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,239
I don't want to die yet!

391
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,600
THWACK!
Fuck!

392
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,479
OK. I'll try again.

393
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,359
Paul.

394
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
The boy that was, that now is.

395
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,879
How has he dragged himself
back to life? Did he eat?

396
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,280
No.

397
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,680
He's important.

398
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,199
Eeny.

399
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,759
Meeny.

400
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,239
Miny.

401
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,879
Mo.

402
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,759
You.

403
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,039
Are.

404
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,080
It.

405
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,360
No, no, no... It's OK, it's OK.

406
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,959
Phil! PHIL!

407
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,560
PHIL!

408
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,560
MUMBLED SINGING

409
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,360

HALTED BREATHING

411
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,759
I went to them. Yeah?

412
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,439
I didn't mean to, but I went to them.

413
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,840
I was drawn there.

414
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,399
Where? Where, Sarah?

415
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,280
I fucked up, Neil. I fucked up.

416
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,120
Jay...

417
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,520
JAY WHIMPERS

418
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,000
You're pretty. You've got hair
like a boy, but you're pretty.

419
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,440
Do you think I'm pretty?

420
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880

421
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,040
Don't cry.

422
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,080
This life is going to be
better for all of us.

423
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,039
I was never happy as a human.

424
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,600
But when the change happens to you,
and it will...

425
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,600
the world just... opens up.

426
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,320
Natalie.

427
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,920
Don't worry, he'll come for you.

428
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,119
Jay. Have, er... Have you seen Jay?

429
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,039
Jay? I'm sorry.
She was the last one they took.

430
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,640
They took Phil.

431
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,000
Where? Where did they take her?

432
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,240
Paul!

433
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,919
Hello, Paul.

434
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,279
Dr Tremlett.

435
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,959
How's the nightmares?

436
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,680
Still wetting the bed?
He's one of them.

437
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,559
Dr Tremlett.

438
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,680
I need to leave.

439
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,239
Are you going to get out my way?
Paul...

440
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,559
Don't pick a fight with it. You
should listen to your friend, Paul.

441
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,800
He's afraid.
I'm surprised you're not.

442
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,559
You used to always
be afraid of everything.

443
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,320
I'm still afraid.

444
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,799
I'm afraid
of letting my friends down,

445
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,879
I'm afraid of not being good enough,

446
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,560
I'm afraid
of not doing the right thing.

447
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,240
But you?

448
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,439
I'm bored of being afraid
of things like you.

449
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,039
Do you remember I told you once
that you reminded me of me?

450
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,760
You remember I told you once
to get out of my way?

451
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,320
They've got my girlfriend.
I need to get back to her.

452
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,599
You always were...

453
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,800
such a whinging little shit.

454
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,639
And all that talking, whining...

455
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,039
"I can't control my bladder."

456
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,959
Well, fuck you and fu...

458

We may not be able to kill you but
we can keep you from doing damage.

459
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,919
This was a mistake! I'm losing me.

460
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,319
I've got this hunger. This hunger.
No. You're strong.

461
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,359
You're strong.
You're stronger than you know.

462
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,879
Listen to me.

463
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,319
You need to go to the school.

464
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,999
I'm not leaving you.
No way am I leaving you.

465
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,559
You did this for us.

466
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,999
For me.

467
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
Neil, that's not true.

468
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,559
I did it partly for you,

469
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,799
and partly because...

470
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,440
I was frightened of what was going
to happen to me, but mostly...

471
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
mostly...

472
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,800
I did it because Mark didn't want
me around any more and I couldn't...

473
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,880
You always did see the best in me.

474
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,600
Mark.

475
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,359
Please, please leave me.

476
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,999
Leave me.

477
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,239
You need to go to the school.

478
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,319
You need to stop him.

479
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,119
For me.

480
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,480
For everyone.

481
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,280
The boiler room.

482
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,480
The boiler room.

483
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
OK.

484
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,160

What did I do?!
What did I do to him, Neil?!

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,839
You killed him, Paul!
You can kill them.

502
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,720
Where is he? Where's the killer?

No, no, no. Stay back. Stay back!

513
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,759
Paul, you need to kill him.

514
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,639
I can't see him. I can't see him!

515
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,959
It could be any of them. Kill them
all! My mum's in this room!

Not the murders,

00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,360
Now!

533
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,320
SIRENS WAIL

534
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,560
This can't be why I came back.

535
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,079
No.

536
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,119
I killed Steve.

537
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,400
And that... girl.

538
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,960
Natalie.

539
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,919
They burnt up.

540
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,759
But they were dead already, right?
I don't want to be a killer.

541
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,119
You don't have to be one.

542
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,039
Superman could crush Lois Lane after
an argument about the washing-up.

543
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,160
He could melt the Daily Planet
after a bad day at the office.

544
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,160
He doesn't.

545
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,560
He uses his powers for good.

546
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,080
That's all you need to do.

547
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,840
Got to go.

548
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,200
SIRENS WAIL

549
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,759
It's you and me, then.

550
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,159
We start a clean up, Paul, now.
And identify them? How?

551
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,959
I can't tell them apart from
ordinary people, can you?

552
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,119
We don't even know how many of them
there are. Well, we'll find a way.

553
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,920
A way that doesn't involve me
killing everyone?

554
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,119
Look after him, won't you?

555
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,399
Paul?

556
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,200
I think he can look after himself.

557
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,479
Look after your mum.

558
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,960
That I will try to do.

559
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,879
Look after yourself.

560
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,599
You want me to look after me?

561
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,920
Yeah.

562
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,320
Give me your hands.

563
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,519
You've got three seconds. OK.

564
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,199
Three.

565
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,999
Two. One.

566
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,880
OK? OK.

567
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,360
Look after yourself, too.

568
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,920
Yeah.

569
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,520
You ready?

570
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,480
Probably not.

571
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,960
Come on.

572
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,520
A 17-year-old boy, Neil.

573
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,160
And if these powers have been
given to me for a reason, then...

574
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,679
maybe it's not to kill everyone.

575
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,919
Maybe it's because I can see past
your shit and his shit.

576
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,959
Is that the shit
that just saved your life?

577
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,959
If all the world
needed was more death...

578
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,839
then you'd have been given these powers.
If I had one-tenth of your powers,

579
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,719
I'd be giving you
such a fucking kicking.

580
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,679
I'm going to find a better plan.

581
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,199
Another way.

582
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,799
Ascension is broken,
I'm going to put it right.

583
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,839
Better? You think you can do better?

584
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,100
You're signing a death
warrant for everyone here.

585
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,359
There's going to be
reborns everywhere.

586
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,880
DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME!

587
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,280
DOORBELL RINGS

588
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,920
Hello.

589
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,479
Hi.

590
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,000
Can I come in?

591
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,439
You've got no time. No time.

592
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,599
Dad, I have things here worth
thousands of pounds on eBay.

593
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,680
I refuse to rush.

594
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah. Why rush?

595
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,040
Tortoise always wins.

596
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,559
I'm here to take you with me, Mac.

597
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,599
Where?

598
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,839
Somewhere I can persuade Paul
to follow.

599
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,159
You're taking me hostage?

600
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,799
Yeah.

601
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,479
That's about the most efficient
way of putting it.

602
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,119
Why?

603
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,279
Because he's stronger than me
in every way...

604
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,439
except one.

605
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,879
He has people he cares about.

606
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,399
I'm his weakness?

607
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,799
Yep.

608
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,359
And I intend to take
full advantage of that fact.

609
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,679
MAC'S DAD: Come on, Mac. Hurry up.

610
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,760
Don't make me hurt your dad, Mac,
because I am this close.

611
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,080
Get a move on.

612
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,360
Mac!

613
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,240
Mac!

614
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,559
Mac!

615
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,679
Paul, kitchen.
Anna, get some clothes.

616
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,239
Jay, call your mum.

617
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,240
You've got five minutes.

618
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,119
Paul.

619
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,039
What I saw you do...

620
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,760
Best to forget about that, Mum.

621
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,520
Sometimes, I'd sit outside your room
listening to you have nightmares.

622
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,240
I'm scared.

623
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,759
That's understandable.

624
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't know whether to be
scared for you or scared of you.

625
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,440
I'm going to make you
proud of me, Mum.

626
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,800
I hope so.

627
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,880
I'm a teeny tiny bit claustrophobic,

628
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:26,400
so if you could leave the light on...
Shut up.

629
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,159
Can you knock?!

630
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,799
Erm, where's that
stripy hoodie of yours?

631
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,160
Have you packed all the food?
We need to move quickly.

632
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,760
DOG BARKS

633
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,080
I'll kill you.

634
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,960
Now!

635
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,680
You make one move towards my family.

636
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,799
Jesus. That almost
sounded grown-up, then.

637
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,519
That was very manly, very good.

638
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,559
I meant...

639
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,279
I mean it. You know,
it's interesting, isn't it?

640
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,239
When I kill,

641
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,999
people can come back.

642
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,079
But then when you kill,
people are wiped from existence.

643
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,319
Yeah? Why's that interesting?

644
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,560
Because I'm the one
people think is the monster.

645
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,399
And today, you killed the one
person I had left that I loved.

646
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,319
And I wanted you
to feel similar pain.

647
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,040
Me and you, we're the same.

648
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,719
I'm the chosen one of my people.

649
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,880
You're the chosen one of yours.
Nah, we're not alike.

650
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,599
I will find a way...

651
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,879
to hurt you.

652
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,400
To kill you.

653
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,359
I didn't come back to be a monster.

654
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,640
D'you hear me?

655
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,200
I'll find a way to help you.

656
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,039
Free you. No, good luck with that.

657
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,840
You have been NOTHING
but helpful so far.
