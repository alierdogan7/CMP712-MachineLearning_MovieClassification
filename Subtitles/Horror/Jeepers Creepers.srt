00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,098
I have a power cable for it.

170
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,726
Yeah, and I have a cigarette lighter
that doesn't work.

171
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,813
[moans] Goddamnit,
what did I say? My car!

172
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,606
We should've taken my car!

173
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,069
He's coming up right on our ass.

174
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,619
[truck horn blowing]

175
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,954
What the hell has he got in that thing?
He's got it souped-up or something.

176
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,259
- [truck horn blowing]
- Darry...

177
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,973
- He's coming up right on our ass.
- What does he have in that thing?

178
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,434
- [screams]
- [tires screeching]

179
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,651
- You're out of your fucking mind!
- [engine revving]

180
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,987
- [screams]
- [grunts]

181
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,578
What the hell's your problem?

182
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,499
- [tires screeching]
- Fuck me! Go!

183
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,385
- What the hell's the matter with you!
- [truck horn blowing]

184
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,303
[brakes screeching]

185
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,393
- Darry, what are you doing?
- Hang on.

186
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,102
Just don't kill us, OK?

187
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,940
[tires screeching]

188
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,115
[engine sputtering]

189
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,702
[birds squawking]

190
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,706
[both panting]

191
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,903
[engine starting]

192
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,158
Sounds all right.

193
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,077
What?

194
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,248
- Like either of us would know.
- I know a little.

195
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,294
Your car makes a strange noise, you just
get a new tape, Darry. You told me.

196
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,837
I told you?

197
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,297
I learned it from you.

198
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,175
Jesus Christ...

199
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,386
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait.

200
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:12,222
I'm thinking past the point of my own
selfish little existence now, OK?

201
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,899
We're both pretty damn sure

202
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,568
what we saw him
dump down that pipe, right?

203
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,947
What if it's someone still alive?

204
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,951
What if it was?

205
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,745
Someone who needs help.

206
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,456
We can get help just as fast
by getting to a phone.

207
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,625
You have any idea how far
we are from the nearest phone?

208
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,168
We were just attacked!

209
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,962
And you don't even
wanna find out why?

210
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,092
We look in the pipe, that's it.

211
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,679
Is this your idea of a
little adventure or something?

212
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,931
'Cause this is why
girls are smarter, OK?

213
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,352
We look in the pipe, if there's
nothing there, nothing we can do,

214
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,771
we just drive on home
and call the cops.

215
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,648
You know that's what we should do.

216
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,942
- Bullshit, I do.
- Bullshit, you don't!

217
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,695
Look me in the eye and tell me
you can just drive away.

218
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,947
Drive off, leave whosever
back there, back there.

219
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,826
Maybe find out later they'd still
be alive if you'd just gone back.

220
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,286
Don't make this about
the right thing to do.

221
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,663
You just wanna go back there
and see if there's something nasty

222
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,499
at the end of that pipe.

223
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,667
[sighs]

224
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,419
OK.

225
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,923
And what if
it was you back there?

226
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,349
I'm not getting out of this car.

227
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,476
- You don't have to.
- I'm not.

228
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,026
[crows cawing softly]

229
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:38,785
[crows cawing loudly]

230
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,292
[Darry] Jesus, it's a church.

231
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,849
What's with all the birds?

232
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,946
I'm just gonna look.

233
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,123
[crows cawing]

234
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,052
Let's just do this,
and do it fast.

235
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,244
- Oh, my God.
- Ohh...

236
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,418
- Doesn't look like a sewer pipe.
- Yeah, doesn't smell like one either.

237
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,298
Come on, I can't
see anything in there.

238
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,675
[mutters] You can see
light down there.

239
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,011
Get a flashlight.

240
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,972
Come on, get a flashlight.

241
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,142
Hello!

242
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,521
Anybody down there?

243
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,194
Hey! Anybody down there?

244
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,660
[faint voice echoing]

245
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,037
Hello!

246
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,792
Hurry up. Come on.

247
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,002
Hello!

248
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,759
There's someone down there,
I just heard them. Hello!

249
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,970
You're hearing things, Darry.

250
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,266
Darry, don't even
think about it!

251
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,227
- Darry!
- I told you I heard someone.

252
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,729
You know the part
in scary movies

253
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,773
where somebody does
something really stupid,

254
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,859
and everybody hates
them for it? This is it.

255
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,903
[voice whimpering]

256
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,240
- Hello!
- No, Darryl

257
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,117
- Let me slide down.
- Goddamnit!

258
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,619
- Let me get a little way in.
- You're not going down there.

259
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,749
I'm not. Just hold my feet.

260
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,875
The feet?

261
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,048
[gasping]

262
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,765
[exhaling] Anybody down there?

263
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,602
When was the last time
you washed these socks?

264
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,438
I see something.

265
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,649
- Hello!
- I am counting to ten.

266
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,818
Something's moving down there.

267
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,152
And then I am letting go
and going back to my car.

268
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,906
Quiet! I just saw it again.

269
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,993
OK, something is definitely
moving down there.

270
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,286
[screams]

271
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,246
- Darryl
- It's rats!

272
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:07,790
- [Trisha] What?
- Rats!

273
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,001
Rats! It's rats!

274
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,460
Rats!

275
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,047
[screams]

276
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,050
[yells]

277
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,398
Darry!

278
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,320
Oh, God, Darry, talk to me!

279
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,576
Darry, say something!

280
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,121
[whimpering groan]

281
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,914
Are you OK?

282
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,667
[moaning]

283
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,465
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there, Dar?

284
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,925
Aah! [gasping, groans]

285
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,019
- Oh, you suck.
- [Trisha] Oh...

286
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,690
- God, I am so sorry.
- Oh, I bet you are.

287
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,358
I am.
I don't know what happened.

288
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,360
You were kicking,
and I couldn't hold on...

289
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,403
Not as sorry as I am.

290
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,323
Hey, there were rats coming at my face.

291
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,659
They were running at me too, Trish.

292
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,709
I feel really bad. Are you OK?

293
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,547
Thank you so much, by the way.
Thank you for this.

294
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,633
Trisha Jenner,
coming through in the clutch.

295
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,802
Thank you.

296
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,223
[Trisha] You were the one
who wanted to come back here

297
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,850
- and have a little adventure.
- Oh, shut up.

298
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,229
How the hell are you gonna
get out of there?

299
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,410
<i>Barry'?</i>

300
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,790
What?

301
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>Barry'?</i>

302
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,770
[whispers] Say it isn't so.

303
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,400
[softly] Hello...

304
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,033
Did I hear you talking?

305
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,877
[Trisha] Darry, who in the holy hell
are you talking to down there?

306
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,296
I found our body.

307
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,173
- [Trisha] You what?
- I found our...

308
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,132
- [thud]
- [screams]

309
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,800
- Jesus! Get off!
- [Trisha] Darry! Darry! Darry!

310
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,152
[gasps]

311
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,288
[gasping]

312
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,507
What?

313
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,618
- [shuddering]
- What? What?

314
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,832
[indistinct]

315
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,518
[Trisha] Darry?

316
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,900
Say something.
You're scaring the shit out of me!

317
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,988
Darry, tell me what's going on!

318
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,327
What?

319
00:24:55,786 --> 00:25:00,248
- We gotta get out of here.
- No, let's stay and feed the birds.

320
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,292
Get help.

321
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,586
Get help, Trish.

322
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,089
[Trisha] What are you looking at?

323
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,591
Get out to the road
and find somebody who can help.

324
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,302
How are you gonna get out of there?

325
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,890
This is some kind of basement,
right, for the church?

326
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,269
Oh, you don't think
I'm going in there, do you?

327
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,730
Get out to the road,
flag down anyone you see,

328
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,107
tell them to get the cops
out here right away.

329
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,818
There's gotta be a way out.
I'm gonna find it.

330
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,320
And, Trish...

331
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,240
...if you see that old truck coming,

332
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,368
you get back to this pipe,
you holler down as loud as you can.

333
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,955
You just had to say that, right?

334
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,297
[crow caws]

335
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,628
[drops falling]

336
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,660
- [crow shrieks]
- [gasps, exhales]

337
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,969
[crow continues cawing]

338
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,120
[quietly shuddering]

339
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,213
[continues shuddering softly]

340
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,688
[engine rumbling]

341
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,659
[engine turning]

342
