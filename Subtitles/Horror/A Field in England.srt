- Course you haven't.

Yeah, quite right too.

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,931
Yeah. You're a wise sort, you, ain't you?

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,970
I could tell by your hands,

Am I right?

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,924

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,570
Not in Essex.

193
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,246
Yeah, recruiters came to the village,

194
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
singing a song
about the glory of the battle.

195
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,001

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,249
Yeah. What about you?

200
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,411
Ah, assistant to a gentleman at Norwich,

201
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,406
an eminent alchemist, physician
and astrologer, amongst other things.

202
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,607
Right.

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,530
I was charged with the compilation
of sundry details

204
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,409
for his almanacs and charts,

205
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,525
aid his prominent friends, patrons,
politicians in their decisions,

206
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,921
all of great rank and fortune.

207
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,727
I was often given leave of his library,
which holds many a closely guarded tome,

208
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,450
to educate myself.

209
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,769
My father's poverty
forced me to leave school early

210
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,923
but the master saw something of a...
Of a student in me.

211
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,129
Oh, an astrologer, you say? Right.

212
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,729
Yes. Yes. The, er, celestial bodies.

218
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,324
No, I don't... Sorry.

220
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,440
- Sounds badly paid.
- Ah, well, well.

221
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,928
My master says that knowledge
is its own payment.

222
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,688
Yeah, well, the only knowledge I have is
that God controls my fate as he sees fit,

223
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,525
and I try to draw consolation from that,

224
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,321
though I would like to know which
of my many faults he's punishing me for now.

353
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,681
- What's at the end?
- Hang on, hang on.

354
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,923
Ah, rowan wood.

355
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,365
More important, what of the alehouse?

356
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,441
After.

357
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,801
You know, that's a fine stake you've got there.
I'll give you that.

358
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,684
I don't pull well on an empty pocket.

359
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,691
Every man has his price.

360
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,088
(HUFFS) My price ain't buttons.

361
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,245
Take your pick.

362
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,001
(SIGHS) Well, I'll be jiggered.

363
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,444
(RUMBLING)

364
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,401
Oh.

365
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,601
Mmm. Hmm.

366
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,240
Ah.

367
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,321
You won't eat?

368
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,044
I do not suffer the same hunger
<i>as</i> our friends.

369
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,327
I believe they would sell any religion
for a jug of beer.

370
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,851
You have an angel about you.
You've been touched for the king's evil.

371
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,925
What was it like to look upon His Majesty?

372
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,207
Curiosity fuels you, then, not food.

373
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,081
Let the King worry on his own magic.

374
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,329
God knows he needs it.

375
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,922
I, however, need yours.

376
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,120
- (GROANS)
- Pull, coward.

377
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,049
- Pull!
- I am!

378
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,607
(GRUNTING)

379
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,241
(GRUNTS) You fuck!

380
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,089
Take the strain. Dig your heel in!
Dig your heel in!

381
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,525
COOPER; All right!

382
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,365
Come on! Come on!

383
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,205
(GRUNTING)

384
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,323
One, two, three.

385
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,130
Heave!

386
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,085
One, two, three.

387
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,525
Heave!

388
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,321
- Pull!
- (GRUNTING)

389
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,920
- He's coming!
- Is that all?

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,570
A fucking man?

391
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,921
A cripple perhaps?

392
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,888
Maybe he's uncommonly fat.

393
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,725
I once had to pull
my father-in-law from a bog.

394
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,205
You're in possession of a wife?
I can't believe that possible.

395
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,369
Perhaps, still, there was a misunderstanding
before I left, concerning a small fire.

396
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,007
He's coming!

397
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,368
Get up, you lazy bastard!

398
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,762
Pull, damn you!

399
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,049
What beautiful colours.

400
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,409
(CREAKING)

401
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,806
(INAUDIBLE)

402
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,042
(CREAKING CONTINUES)

403
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,287
(CHIMING)

404
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,604
No more pulling!

405
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,047
(PANTING)

406
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,408
I have brought assistance.

407
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,286
- (THUMPING)
- Oh! Sir! Sir! No, sir!

408
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,762
(THUDDING)

409
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,526
We should intervene.

410
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,611
That is he.

411
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,081
Who?

412
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,371
O'Neil.

413
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,811
The man I was charged with locating.

414
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,929
Then I am vindicated.

415
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,248
(GRUNTING)

416
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,526
Right.

417
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,681
(SQUEALING)

418
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,808
Get up, you bastard!

419
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,844
- (GRUNTING)
- Easy now. Easy now.

420
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,203
Hold him tight, boys. Beg pardon.

421
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,886
- (MARCHING DRUMBEAT)
- (GRUNTS)

422
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,645
(GROANING)

423
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,282
You men will assist me in his detainment.

424
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,561
Mmm.

425
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,525
Like gossamer.

426
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,921
What is it with you and hands?

427
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,768
News is, Cromwell's men marched north
to meet the Engagers.

428
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,562
I heard he exacted terrible revenge
on the Welsh bastards at Pembroke, sir.

429
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,643
Indeed.

430
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,605
This Irish bastard requires his mirror.

431
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,161
CUTLER; (WHISPERS) Sorry, sir.

432
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,966
Here?

433
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,089
What's that he holds?

434
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,890
A scrying mirror.

435
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,283
- A what? His what?
- WHITEHEAD: An occult tool.

436
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,325
A means for telling the past,
present, perhaps even the future.

437
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,244
He must have utilised
some diabolical method

438
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,209
to conceal his presence in the field.

439
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,601
That is why he was not visible.

440
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,851
You think he sees what an arsehole he looks,

441
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,526
standing there like the King himself?

442
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,681
No.

443
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,082
Wasn't sure which one he was at first.
Cowardly type, though.

444
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,970
You should not have any trouble from him.

445
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,600
He was the one
that would not eat mushrooms.

446
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,641
I know which one he is, Cutler.

447
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,961
Come on.

448
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,724
- Ugh.
- Stand up!

449
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,882
What are you doing? Get up.

450
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,123
(SIGHS) I don't feel 'em.

451
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,762
- What?
- My balls.

452
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,042
They've ceased screaming.

453
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,968
That is good, is it not?
Ii means the nettle's sting has run its course.

454
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,930
Maybe I mislaid 'em
when I was pulling the rope.

455
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,569
(CHORTLING)

456
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,211
Whitehead.

457
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,640
O'Neil.

458
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,170
I have my quarry, sir.

459
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,449
You were expected, sir.

460
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,567
Indeed?

461
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,406
A lot of time has passed since we
shared company. Things have changed.

462
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,046
WHITEHEAD: In the absence
of better-qualified men, sir,

463
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,407
I hereby place you under arrest

464
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,930
for the theft of certain documents
from the private collection of my master.

465
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,243
What the fuck is this?

466
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,525
It's a shovel.

467
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,764
In the presence of Merciful God,
I trust you will now surrender yourself

468
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,208
and return willingly
to Norwich to face your accuser.

469
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,046
How is our master?

470
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,405
Well, I pray.

471
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,844
I believe he still has you doing a lot of that.

472
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,524
Praying, I mean.

473
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,288
The master is of advanced years,
as you know.

474
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,843
Your outrageous pillage
has greatly aggravated his dropsy.

475
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,245
CUTLER: Move.

476
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,968
COOPER: What kind of merry band is this?

477
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,600
O'NEIL: I'm sure
he would have come himself.

478
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,283
But instead he sends you.

479
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,569
The faithful servant.

480
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,170
O'NEIL: Come, walk.

481
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,083
You need no invitation.

482
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,607
This is your country, is it not?

483
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,290
Although I've claimed a small corner
which I'm intent on raping a little.

484
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,002
'Tis only fair that I take something
in return for my countrymen's troubles.

485
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,806
Cutler has you marked as a coward.

486
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,122
It's comforting to know that things
haven't changed greatly in my absence.

487
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,966
'Tis true I hid in a bush
as Mr Trower and his men were set upon.

488
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,405
Ah, Trower.

489
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,130
The dunderhead mercenary.
How is he?

490
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,286
Dead.

491
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,085
Then your arrest is academic, is it not?

492
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,804
Unless you will comply freely,
as a Christian man.

493
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,522
(CHUCKLES)

494
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,844
It would seem the master
has kept you a veritable virgin

495
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,281
as to the workings of the world.

496
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,250
'Tis true I have been
mostly amongst books.

497
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,767
I find pages easier to turn than people.

498
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,930
Although I confess I have acquired
one new skill in your absence.

499
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,286
Indeed?

500
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,410
Er, lacemaking.

501
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,568
Only in my spare time, which is limited,

502
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,086
because of my increased duties
in your absence,

503
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,451
but, um, of the highestquality, I'm told.

504
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,645
He has not only kept you a stranger
to the world but to yourself, it seems.

505
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,531
I do not follow.

506
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,445
O'NEIL: You will.

507
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,010
Unfortunately, my constitution was not
suited to the master's pious regiment.

508
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,651
I am forced to branch out on me own.

509
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,003
I owe money everywhere.

510
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,443
To so many I lose track.

511
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,602
Perhaps even to God himself.

512
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,250
We shall venture to Continental Europe
when the opportunity arises.

513
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,087
I have had little success
in applying the master's arts

514
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,647
in looking for anything of great worth.

515
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,801
Which is why I have conjured you.

516
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,001
This place holds a great treasure.

517
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,529
I am certain of it.

518
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,962
I merely require a keener eye
to pinpoint the particular location.

519
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,562
And as much as I detest you personally,
Whitehead,

520
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,726
I acknowledge that your gifts
are stronger in certain areas.

521
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,807
But you are now my divining rod.

522
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,203
I have little of my master's art in divination.

523
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,603
You are confused, sir.

524
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,043
It is I who am capturing you,
not the other way around.

525
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,525
(CHUCKLES)

526
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,322
Do not concern yourself with bravery now,
Whitehead.

527
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,450
'Ti$ official.

528
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,724
You are my prisoner.

529
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,410

with a low sort, Whitehead!

He's injured.
He lies some 70-odd yards or so yonder.

Will he find you running away?

895
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,410
He will not, sir.

You think there was treasure in this field?

898
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,242
The treasure is here between us,
is it not, friend?

899

Huh!
