1
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:56,336
I read your article.
- Article?
More like a blurt if you ask me.

2
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,070
It was well written.
- Spare me your sympathy Marcus.

3
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,221
Come on Carmen.
How long you gonna be
bitter about your work.

4
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:08,311
its bullshit.
i write one Controversial article 
and im pushed down to the bottom of the food chain.

5
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:12,329
you probably shoulda left it alone, 
you knew it was gonna get you in trouble.

6
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,516
can we just stop talking about this please?

7
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:21,895
ok , well what do you want to talk about?
maybe the fact that half the time you spend with me, 
your typing on the phone?

8
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:26,210
or that you break our plans after we make them?
cos im good with iether

9
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,886
wheres this coming from?

10
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:34,441
forget about it, im gonna get going.

11
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:37,452
no! Seriously, what is this

12
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,076
You think that this is fun for me?

13
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,402
it seems liek everytime we hang out,
your mind is somewhere else.

14
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:48,913
I am swamped with work right now marcus,
you know that.

15
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:52,476
yeah so am i, but i turn it off when im with you.

16
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:55,540
you gotta give a little.
- oh so now im selfish?

17
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:58,080
Yeah, kinda.
- ok, i think thats enough.

18
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:10,670
Yeah, I think it is, im outa here.

marcus..

19
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:23,859
Bees?
- Yeah, bees.

20
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:29,600
A farmer in orchid medow, Omaha caims that non of the bees
do not return to the hive

21
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:33,169
and only 20% of the
crop is being pollinated.

22
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,464
Why dont we try something else

23
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:39,380
ive got a lead on the Eric Taylor case.

24
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:43,556
look .. a young man goes back packing across Europe and
goes missing, it happens all the time.

25
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,281
its a dead case.
- No, there's more to it than that.

26
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:49,977
He was last seen leaving a motel in Kozki, Poland.

27
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:53,247
Sara and I have have been doing some research. 
we found record of 5 tourists who have gone missing

28
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:56,483
during the last 50 years,
while travelling through the exact same area.

29
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,633
Carmen, how many times do i have to tell you?

30
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:02,232
Listen ok , the strange thing is that shortly
after they disappear ...

31
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:05,796
their luggage shows up at random cities
all over eastern Europe.

32
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:08,966
now i spoke to Laura Taylor,
Eric's mom ...

33
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,482
she recently received a call from prague airport

34
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,896
saying they had erics luggage.

35
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,411
theres no record of him ever entering the Czech Republic.

36
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:21,326
that doesn't sound like fresh concrete evidence to me.

37
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:24,093
Have you ever been
to an airport?

38
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:28,721
Luggage gets lost all the time.
Not interested.

39
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:35,198
And Carmen 

40
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:41,648
I do not want you and sarah wasting company time, 
with this misisng person stuff.

41
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:44,412
are we clear?

42
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,805
Hello.
- Hi mrs. Taylor.

43
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,841
I'm Carmen Berk.
- Carmen,its so  nice to finally meet
you,please, call me Laura.

44
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,963
This is Sara Titasal, she
is an intern at our company.

45
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:17,796
Hello Laura.
- its a pleasure, 
please come in.

46
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:23,529
Eric had been planning
his trip for over a year.

47
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,573
He was.. never much into school.
He always just wanted to travel.

48
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,971
and where are the police with this now?

49
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,061
its an absolute joke.

50
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:37,571
i contacted theKoski police,
they say they found nothing.

51
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:39,700
I contacted the police here ...

52
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,716
and after waiting days for them to get back to me ...

53
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:47,272
they call and tell me that eric 
is now officially on a missing persons list.

54
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,759
and that his case
has been moved to a different department.

55
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,676
You mentioned you've been contacted about erics luggage,
have you been able to claim it yet?

56
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:58,670
Yes, it's upstairs in his room.

57
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:03,638
All his clothes are there, his books,
his journal, his hotel receipts.

58
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,945
di you tell the police that?
i mean, there could be evidence.

59
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,350
yes Of course, I called them right away.

60
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,506
They told me that they were too backed up to come.

61
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,131
That they would get to it, when they could.

62
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:21,478
would it be ok if i take a look at erics luggage?
there may something there that may help us.

63
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:24,307
Yes, ofcourse, please.

64
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,793
will you forgive me if i dont escort u up

65
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:34,864
I find it difficult to be in that room.
- I understand.

thank you

66
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,677
It's upstairs on the right.

67
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,210
I'll make some tea.
- ill help you.

68
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:53,427
That was Eric and his cousin, when
they decided they wanted to get tattoos.

69
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,681
I told them they were
crazy, but ...

70
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,327
Eric really wanted one.

71
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:03,898
Is this your husband?
- Yeah, that's my Jim.

72
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,836
He passed away five years ago.

73
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,271
I'm sorry.
- it hurt eric alot.

74
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,908
Laura , can i borrow this for the time being?
its erics journal.
but id really love to spend some more time with it

75
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,374
I don't see why not.

76
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,566
I don't imagine the police will want it any time soon.

77
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:32,261
Thank you for your time.

78
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,380
The last journal entry..
 Alvainia.

79
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:16,029
Leave me alone.

80
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,526
look I hate fighting with you.

81
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:38,006
well obviously were fighting for a reason.
- I know. And I agree.

82
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,529
my head hasn't been in this relationship lately.

83
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:45,782
But I want to fix that.
which is why i think you should come on this trip with me.

84
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:52,590
I appreciate that.
But if were going to take a trip together, 
why dont we go to the Cayman Islands or something?

85
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,804
Because there is no story in the Cayman Islands.

86
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:59,453
right..right.
- Come on Marcus.

87
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:03,410
I think your a great photographer and
I want you to shoot this.

88
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:07,582
tell you what, Ill leave my
BlackBerry in the hotel.

89
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:12,570
I do not know, Carmen it sounds
a little dangerous.

90
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,450
could be.
- I'm not kidding.

91
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,011
im surprised that Dale would even allow this, 
this sounds like a police matter.

92
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,986
Yeah, well the police aint doing shit.

93
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,117
I'm going no matter what.
i have to, ive already booked the tickets

94
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:37,105
just think about it alright.

95
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,823
I gotta get back.

96
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:57,347
heres the contact info for Carl Pierson,
hes the farmer with the dying crops.

97
00:13:57,382 --> 00:14:00,824
theres another farm house just east of him with the same problem.

98
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:04,880
These bees are literaly just dying off.

99
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,699
Anyway.
He looks forward to meeting the two of you.

100
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,891
this should be a good experience for you Sarah.
are you excited?

101
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:16,289
Yeah..very excited.

102
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:22,111
Well. Keep up the good work girls. Rock and Roll.
- Rock and Roll.

103
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,936
marcus
Yeah? Okay, great.

104
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:35,615
Oh no, we should have everything prept soon.

105
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,963
No we'll break up the details later.

106
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,507
I'm really glad your doing this.

107
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:45,943
ok talk to you soon
bye.

108
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,903
Okay, were good to go.
Marcus is gonna shoot for us.

109
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:55,485
Listen, I want you to start checking out
motels in Poland 

110
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,885
start with the one Eric was staying at in Kozki.

alright

111
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:03,549
I can not believe were doing this.

112
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,052
Were gonna have to start brushing up on our Polish.
- already a step ahead of you.

113
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:38,441
so, what else we know about this place.

114
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:42,158
Not much.
They make their own clothes,
they grow their own food.

115
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:45,840
apparently the lands known for growing mushroooms.

116
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:53,130
it doesnt look like eric was in  Alvainia for very long,
theres only a few journal entries.

117
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:56,477
Hey listen to this one.

118
00:15:56,777 --> 00:16:00,637
theres something odd about this village,
 the people seem very odd and distant.

119
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:04,498
There are no motels or hostels, so
im roughing it in an old barn.

120
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,828
ive noticed some kind of smoke looming
above the tree line on the outer edge of the village.

121
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:13,307
i thought it was a fire at first, 
but it actually seems to be more like a fog,
just sitting there.

122
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,779
was this kid eating the mushrooms by any chance?

123
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:22,140
That must be the turn up ahead.

124
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:03,330
well.. i guess were here.

125
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,916
pull over here, well walk.

126
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,341
Eric wasn't kidding about this place.

127
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,095
Oh my God, thats sick.

128
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:56,441
Come on, hes just a farmer.
need i remind you where hot dogs come from?

129
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:23,556
You said they teach English i school here right?
- Yeah thats what i read.

130
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:38,515
Hi there. Those are beautiful.

131
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:40,927
Do you speak English?

132
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,962
Yes.. little.

133
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:49,753
My name is Carmen, 
thats marcus, and sarah.

134
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:53,378

- Lidia.

135
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,557
Lidia, thats a very pretty name.

136
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,402
Thank you.

137
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,531
We are journalists from America.
Do you know America?

138
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:07,556
Yes, cheeseburgers.

139
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,317
Yes, cheeseburgers.

140
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,698
Have you ever travelled outside
Alvainia, Lidia?

141
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:16,881
No, not allowed.

142
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:20,441
Thats too bad.
Do you like it here?

143
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:24,688
No? how come?

144
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:33,635
listen Lidia, we're looking for a young
man, his names Eric Taylor, have you seen him?

145
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:43,571
You have to go.
- Have you seen this man Lidia?

146
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,870
Let's keep moving.

147
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,304
Is this town Christian ?

148
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:43,256
I do not know, it
seems really strange tho.

149
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:46,707
look at that guy, there treating him like roaylty.

150
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,956
holy shit..
speaking of strange.

151
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,433
That's it, thats gotta be what
Eric was talking about.

152
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:06,858
well how can that be? its still here.

153
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,879
What the hell is it?

154
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:13,823
Im not sure, 
but its the last thing he wrote about in his journal.

155
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,583
i say we check it out.

156
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:27,968
i dont understand how it can just be sitting there, 
in that one part of the forest?

157
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,454
I can see why Eric was intrigued.

158
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,039
I'm sorry,do you speak English?
- You, go.

159
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,382
We are looking for someone,

167
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,533
Pull over Marcus.
- What? Why?

168
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:38,171
just pull over for a minute

169
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,484
We have to go back.

- what, are you kidding me?

170
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,993
Those guys looked like they
wanted to kill us.

171
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,462
There hiding something up there in that forest.

172
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:53,188
No, they wanted us out of there the minute we got into town.

173
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:55,462
No, that guy followed us half way round the village

174
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:58,673
it wasnt till we started walking towards the fog
that he came after us.

175
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,253
that was the one place they wouldnt let us go
and the last place eric may have been.

176
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,310
you dont think thats a major coincidence?

177
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:11,412
Carmen , we cant.

178
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:14,026
We have to.
- Why?

179
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,765
because if we dont.. my career is done.

180
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,843
Dale does not even know we're here,
he thinks we are in Omaha 

181
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,678
covering some bullshit story.

if i go back empty handed 

182
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:23,993
im finished

183
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,029
Are you fuckin serious?
You never got a go ahead?

184
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,499
Wait ...
you didnt tell him?

185
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,568
hold on a sec.. you knew about this too?

186
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,624
look, there hiding something up there in those trees
and i want to find out what it is.

187
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,389
We came all this way, we cant just turn back now.

188
00:23:52,351 --> 00:23:55,202
Please Marcus, I need this.

189
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,331
We check it out and thats it.

ok

190
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,758
You should have known better,
than to get her mixed up in this.

191
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:46,833
she wanted to be here here.
- She's not your kid.

192
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:52,454
It should be straight ahead from here,
im pretty sure the church is off that way.

193
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:55,065
Yeah this feels right.

194
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:20,267
This is so strange.

195
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:23,056
Hows it not moving?

196
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,083
It's so dense.

197
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,492
It's too dense.
- What do you mean.

198
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,619
I can take a photo of what ever this is from here, 

199
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:38,352
but theres no way i can get a decent shot its so foggy 

200
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,409
lets head in, check it out.
- What difference does it make carmen?

201
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:46,106
we cant shoot what we cant see.

202
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,996
we didnt come all the way up here 
so we could take a picture of some cloud
sitting in a forrest marcus

She locked us in.
