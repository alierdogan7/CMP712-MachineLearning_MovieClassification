664

665
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,844
Three months ago,
a friend of mine sent me this.

666
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,761
It arrived two days after he was found
hanging from his own ceiling fan.

667
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,448
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.

668
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,125
Every case was investigated.

669
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,482
Every blood test came back negative.

670
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,926
My friend began to wonder:

671
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,567
Were they all false leads or was
someone trying to protect the Lycans?

672
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,331
Helping them replenish their packs,
letting them regroup.

673
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,488
What about your own department?

674
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,841
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.

675
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,969
If you're protecting someone, I don't care.
I'm not after them. I just want her.

676
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,566
No.

677
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,445
Even if there are others in my department,
they wouldn't have the authority.

678
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,285
This goes much higher.

679
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,327
