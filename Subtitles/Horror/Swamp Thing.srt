1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:25,276
not long ago, in the unexplored
reaches of an unmapped swamp,

2
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,779
the creative genius of one man

3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:35,619
collided with another's evil
dream and a monster was born.

4
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:43,878
too powerful to be destro yed,
too intelligent to be captured,

5
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,716
this being
still pursues its savage dream.

6
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:22,476
so there's the swamp.
where's the nearest good restaurant?

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,022
depends. if you're a human,
it's back in washington.

8
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:30,526
but if you're a 'gator,
could be right where we land.

9
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,406
thank your lucky stars
you're comin' in at the end of this.

10
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:52,650
holland insisted on building it all out here.
he said this is where the life is.

11
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:56,487
one of those life forms
nailed the guy you're replacing.

12
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,495
what? they sent a woman out here?

13
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,498
- where are you goin'?
- couldn't take it any more.

14
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,251
well, he lasted longer than most.

15
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,361
<i>(radio crackles)</i>

16
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:48,706
boo.

17
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,240
<i>(snake hisses)</i>

18
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,623
no!

19
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,927
weird, isn't it? the local fishermen
say this place is haunted.

20
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,347
i don't know where we are, toto,
but this sure isn't kansas.

21
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,099
what?

22
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,767
nothing.

23
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,532
used to be a church until
about 50 years ago, then the levee broke.

24
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,786
it's just been us and the deer flies
for the last ten weeks.

25
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,455
welcome back, sir.
what did washington say?

26
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,957
that's confidential.

27
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,377
<i>- (man) it's ok, miss. i got it.
- but you can start packin'.</i>

28
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,045
all right.

29
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,719
<i>(man) where's this go?
give me a hand over here with this.</i>

30
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,888
what does holland think
about going back to washington?

31
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,309
i doubt he's been told. ritter couldn't
believe me when i gave him the news.

32
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,314
- do you think washington's paranoid?
- do you think the pope is catholic?

33
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,734
this is your place.

34
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:56,250
you probably haven't seen half this stuff.
it's all new. this is a laser...

35
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:01,672
laser-induced subsonic field generator.
gives double readings in the 3200 band.

36
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,424
i got a trick for fixing that.

37
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,011
they send someone who knows what
she's doin' the week they pull us out!

38
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,262
what's he working on?

39
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,930
- who?
- holland.

40
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:14,352
this thing is so hush-hush, no one asks.
something to do with plants.

41
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,271
<i>(man) where the hell's my man?
i thought he was back.</i>

42
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,273
hey, charlie!

43
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,276
the emperor calls. come on.

44
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,528
hey, you know there's a...

45
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,453
what's going on here?
get those crates into the church.

46
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:38,292
you men in the boat! what are you doing?
get that damn thing outta sight!

47
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,794
lamebrains!

48
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,047
charlie, welcome back.
and this is hank's replacement?

49
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,966
cable, harry ritter,
project field supervisor.

50
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,552
one of your sensors
is reading malfunction.

51
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,555
not surprising.
they rot in a week in these swamps.

52
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,809
charlie, did you get them
to change their minds?

53
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,729
no. they want him and the substance
in washington where they can watch him.

54
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,231
anything wrong?

55
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,735
a rumour. somebody's heard
arcane's gotten wind of the project.

56
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:09,240
- i thought arcane was dead.
- he is. who said that arcane's onto this?

57
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,993
nobody's taking credit for it.
you know washington.

58
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,081
all it takes is one loudmouth
to spill this to holland

59
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,917
and the whole project goes to hell,
do you know that?

60
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,585
yes, sir.

61
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,921
that goes for you, too.

62
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:31,262
come on. i keep the number of people
near to him at a minimum.

63
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:34,849
this admits the three of us,
and the hollands.

64
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,519
it was programmed for your prints
this morning. try it.

65
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,867
the stuff i have put up with - alligators,
bugs, snakes, and now rumours.

66
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,205
charlie, i want to hear everything
about the arcane business, now.

67
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,793
what about that sensor in sector three?

68
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,463
get somebody to take you there
and take a look.

69
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,757
me?

70
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,051
in the swamps?

71
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,900
- any luck there?
- wiggle your fingers.

72
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,736
lose a contact lens?

73
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,822
funny.

74
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:36,494
well, don't just stand there.
give us a hand. right about in the middle.

75
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,578
please?

76
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,586
i dropped a cooper's digger.

77
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,547
would you look under the rocks, please?

78
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:50,091
go ahead.

79
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,347
what's a cooper's digger? a shovel?

80
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,765
nah...

81
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,185
just alessandro.

82
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:08,234
he's got a little one-celled animal living
in his fur that makes a terrific host.

83
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:11,696
terrific. i'll remember that
the next time i throw a party.

84
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,782
oh, not bad. not bad.

85
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,704
- you don't have to be crazy around him...
- but it helps?

86
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,791
alice cable, new kid on the block.
you part of holland's crew?

87
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,210
i'm linda holland.

88
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,712
<i>you're dr holland.</i>

89
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:31,757
<i>i'm a dr holland, but not the dr holland,
boy genius and oddball.</i>

90
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,636
that's alec. he's the brains.
i just cook up what he invents.

91
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,806
don't believe her.
she's got an iq like a phone number.

92
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:43,894
i want you to run up a variation on the
formula with the host on alessandro's fur.

93
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,479
ok.

94
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,988
hello. i understand you have a sensor out.
do you wanna go out and take a look?

95
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,326
well, i guess i could ask charlie
to give us an escort.

96
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,830
we could ask your mother
to come along, too. come on.

97
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,335
the only dangerous thing out there is the
government agents with their popguns.

98
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,254
it's your first day.
i'll take you on a cook's tour.

99
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:15,676
ritter's always after me
to get some fresh air. he'll be tickled pink.

100
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,636
what do you say?

101
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,939
oh, man.

102
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,442
you look like a tree.

103
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,527
sometimes i feel like a tree.

104
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,697
- like the swamps?
- hate the swamps. hate bugs.

105
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,284
- hate things without legs.
- a neatness freak, huh?

106
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:44,205
- you could eat off my kitchen floor.
- you could eat off the swamps.

107
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:47,208
maybe half the world
could eat off the swamps.

108
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,044
more than likely,
the swamps will eat off us.

109
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,713
like, what happened
to the guy i'm replacing?

110
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,302
the 'gator was only following his
natural way. can't blame a guy for that.

111
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,148
i paid a fortune for these boots.

112
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,069
you'd better keep movin'.
there's quicksand around here.

113
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,321
- keep your eyes open, too.
- for what?

114
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,158
one of these just might
jump out and do you in.

115
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,911
<i>there's over 100 species
of genus orchis here.</i>

116
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,748
so much beauty in the swamps,
if you open up your eyes to it.

117
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,752
take a look into your own body,
one of god's most magnificent creations,

118
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,004
and what do you see?

119
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:36,590
straight lines and deodorant,
chrome and formica? no, no, no.

120
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:41,429
you see blood and bone, pump and flow,
and a million messy miracles.

121
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,682
look at the most creative thing
man and woman can do together

122
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,352
and you'll see
something growing, unpredictable,

123
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,771
magical, hot.

124
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:56,277
save the malarkey for your wife, holland.

125
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,363
if you don't mind,
where the hell's the sensor?

126
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,532
it's right over there.

127
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,623
looks ok to me.

128
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,876
here, let me help.

129
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,463
<i>(rattles)</i>

130
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,557
well, it doesn't look ok to me.

131
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,642
- let's get back.
- all right.

132
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,835
charlie?

133
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,092
charlie!

134
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,846
cable, what the hell is your story?

135
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,516
anything suspicious happen
while we were gone?

136
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,435
<i>you're damn right.
something suspicious did happen.</i>

137
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,522
a stupid broad of an agent,
first day on the job,

138
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:19,777
takes a scientist we're supposed
to be guarding for a romp in the bush.

139
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,114
- hold it. just cool it.
- you think you're on a picnic?

140
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,784
wait. it was my idea to take her out there.
she was doin' her job.

141
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,704
- why do you have to be so worried?
- it's my job to worry.

142
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,874
and if i have my way, you'll be
on the next chopper back to washington.

143
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,211
a woman has no place
around a guy like you.

144
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,048
there's a cut sensor out there.

145
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,384
- which sector?
- sector three.

146
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,637
hank was working on that
when he was bitten by the 'gator.

147
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:51,559
he didn't put it all back together again
before we took him to the hospital.

148
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,401
- "tickled pink", huh?
- i'm really sorry, cable.

149
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,490
well, i guess you can't be blamed
for following your natural way.

150
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:10,161
did either of you see
one of our guys out there? ronnie?

151
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,665
- no. why?
- we seem to have lost contact with him.

152
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,584
<i>(explosion)</i>

153
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:27,261
- linda, are you all right?
- it's ok, it's ok.

154
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,269
the damnedest thing.

155
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:39,607
you know this new batch you had me
cook up with the host from alessandro?

156
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,695
i knew we were up to something
revolutionary, but this is dynamite.

157
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,030
watch.

158
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,121
- incredible.
- weird, huh?

159
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,624
- yeah.
- congratulations.

160
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:01,962
you've managed to reinvent nitro. let's
hope this project doesn't end with a bang.

161
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,801
come on, charlie, please.
i gotta write this down.

162
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,887
<i>i thought you were
working on a weapons system.</i>

163
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,723
- i knew it wasn't just plants.
- plants, plants.

164
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,976
the only way i thought my work
would be explosive was socially.

165
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,229
it's never been this volatile before.

166
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:22,483
linda, prep a sample of that
for the electron microscope, please.

167
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,570
- and be very careful with it.
- what is it you've been doing here?

168
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,572
come over here. i'll show you.

169
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,421
you see those little guys?

170
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,424
<i>dna chromosomes
from the common lab bacilli e. coli.</i>

171
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:51,595
now, you see that one? another simple
bacilli. plant matrix called d complex.

172
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:56,517
each of these organisms have existed in
the labs for years, but always separately,

173
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,103
since one is animal, the other's vegetable.

174
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,523
this is what we've developed
over the last couple of months.

175
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:07,778
see that little guy? never existed on the
face of the earth before. that's my baby.

176
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:12,450
a simple vegetable cell with
an unmistakable animal nucleus.

177
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,785
recombinant dna?

178
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,787
hey, that's very good.

179
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:24,712
i am very close to developing a plant with
an animal's aggressive power for survival.

180
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,547
a plant for the 21st century.

181
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,216
you want watermelons
the size of weather balloons

182
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,718
or tomatoes that'll fetch a stick?

183
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:35,556
or a tomato that could grow in the desert.
or soybeans that could thrive in biafra.

184
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:38,392
or corn that could grow in the usa
in the year 2001,

185
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,229
when there'll be 6.5 billion people
on this planet, all of them hungry.

186
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:46,400
- how you doin' there, linda?
- it's all set. vector 3379.

187
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,486
ok.

188
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:57,161
- it's replicating like mad.
- it certainly is.

189
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,498
let's try it on something.

190
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,835
cable, would you bring that flask of water
over here, please?

191
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,421
thank you.

192
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:12,009
if it would work on plants the way
you want it to, what will it do to people?

193
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:16,681
- and what if it falls into wrong hands?
- arcane boogieman mentality, huh?

194
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:19,850
ok, now we begin. 2000 water,

195
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,854
one part formula.

196
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:27,441
2000 water, 6.30 march 20th.

197
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,661
how long before you'll know?

198
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,789
what do you want it to do,
jump out and dance a fandango?

199
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,543
i don't know.
a week maybe, maybe longer.

200
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,463
this has all the thrills
of watching grass grow.

201
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,050
aren't there some sensors
you could be working on?

202
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:56,554
oops.

203
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:01,809
forget it. he's just ridiculously sensitive.
our dad was the same.

204
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,019
your dad?

205
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:06,564
you've never heard of walter holland
the biophysicist?

206
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:10,901
nobel prize. he used to throw
a mean bunsen burner, i can tell you.

207
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:15,322
alec and i spent half our childhood
cleaning up after his tantrums.

208
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,909
perfectionist to the day he died.
alec's the same.

209
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,021
- oh, my god.
- what is that?

210
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,607
cable, i don't believe this.

211
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:54,362
all the places that linda dropped
the formula, the boards grew.

212
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,866
- who are you kidding?
- no, i'm not kidding.

213
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,867
alec...

214
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:03,621
linda! get in here quick!

215
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:07,041
this is fantastic. this is incredible.

216
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,463
oh...

217
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,549
alec, the formula?

218
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:17,968
ritter. he's got to be told right away.

219
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,972
i wanna see that bastard's face
when he realises we've done it.

220
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:25,643
ritter?

221
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,229
ritter?

222
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,818
- you guys seen ritter?
- he's in the command shed.

223
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,945
thanks.

224
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,331
ritter!

225
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,951
charlie...

226
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:58,986
get up!

227
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:02,823
hold it!

228
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,993
- i'm holding.
- it's over, lady.

229
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:11,248
- arcane, right?
- shut up.

230
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,459
alec, watch out!

231
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,307
- very interesting, dr holland.
- on your feet.

232
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,771
- who are you?
- interesting.

233
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,441
now, i know i haven't seen
anything like this before.

234
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:44,991
have you?

235
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,702
what the hell do you want?

236
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,956
i represent a certain party
that's interested in your formula.

237
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:54,208
he'd give an arm and a leg for it.

238
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,877
<i>your arm and leg, if necessary.</i>

239
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,879
get outta my lab! get out!

240
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,131
alec!

241
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,466
what's the hold-up?

242
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:07,722
he's being difficult.

243
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,725
no, ritter. not you.

244
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,061
no, dr holland, not ritter.

245
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:17,815
ritter, poor fellow, is long dead.

246
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:29,577
you have heard of but never seen me,
so i will introduce myself.

247
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,996
my name is arcane.

248
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,583
linda, come here. here.

249
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,002
leave her alone.

250
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:41,088
thank you.

251
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:46,594
all materials pertaining
to the substance, now,

252
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,179
or she dies.

253
00:23:48,346 --> 00:23:52,433
what sort of rejuvenation
will you be able to perform on her then?

254
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,522
- don't, alec.
- it's all right.

255
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:12,203
the actual solution as well.

256
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,546
linda!

257
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,632
linda! linda...

258
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:42,566
what is best for you is not
to be born, not to be, to be nothing.

259
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:47,154
but the second best for you
is to die soon. nietzsche.

260
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,529
- the notebooks.
- i never seen anything like that.

261
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,632
the notebooks, good.

262
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,390
strip it. no bodies.

263
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,143
no witnesses.

264
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,150
no survivors. no trace of them.

265
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,486
you, come here. burn the papers.

266
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,072
burn everything. come on, get a move on.

267
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:15,743
somebody help bruno with the bodies.
i want this place clean by dawn.

268
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,686
- is that the last of 'em?
- that's it.

269
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,021
then get the lead out.

270
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:56,617
- a final check, then vacate the premises.
- right. take that to the boat.

271
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,955
hurry it up.

272
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:04,458
wait a minute.
i'm finding lots of stuff down here.

273
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:05,793
what kind of stuff?

274
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,047
a little of this, a little of that.
come on down and take a look.

275
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:16,053
what you got?

276
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:19,557
- found some money, a watch, and...
- no, this.

277
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:22,143
oh, that. i took it off the girl.

278
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:25,813
you can have it. ain't worth nothin'
compared to the watches.

279
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,649
get out in front.
we're getting out of here.

280
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,345
ferret?

281
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,028
plannin' on goin' somewhere?

282
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:17,198
come on, let's take a little walk.

283
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,282
bastard!

284
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:21,952
my, haven't you gotten dirty?
my goodness!

285
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:24,455
tyrone, come here.

286
00:28:24,622 --> 00:28:28,459
i think this lady needs a bath.
let's take her down to the dock.

287
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:29,960
where'd she come from?

288
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:31,462
help!

289
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,548
help!

290
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,718
get the boat ready.

291
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:44,892
move it. we don't have all day,
and i wanna teach this lady how to swim.

292
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,561
the first lesson's called the dead man's...

293
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,230
ow!

294
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:53,484
you wanna play rough, huh?

295
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,705
say hello to your boyfriend, baby.

296
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,464
what the hell was that?

297
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:05,056
willie! tyrone! shoot the damn thing.

298
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:22,490
get it! kill it - and her!

299
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,492
you, too!

300
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:28,913
back in the swamps.

301
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,259
willie, go that way.
tyrone, cover that area.

302
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,538
<i>(cough)</i>

303
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,626
so long, baby.

304
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,382
willie?

305
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,054
flank right.

306
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,791
no, no, no! what are you doin?

307
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,798
what the hell are you doin', danny?

308
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,637
spread out.

309
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,306
keep your head.

310
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,490
- where's danny?
- where's willie?

311
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,827
- maybe willie's with tyrone.
- danny shot tyrone.

312
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,744
oh, yeah.

313
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,830
<i>(roaring)</i>

314
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:20,835
- maybe we should...
- get the hell outta here.

315
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,600
the work with dna, i expected.

316
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:41,605
but the combining
of plant and animal is astonishing.

317
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:45,359
astonishing.

318
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:51,699
- you should sleep, sir.
- i can't.

319
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:56,120
it was all so near,
right there in the palm of my hand, and...

320
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,125
but it's lovely not to sleep,

321
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:06,714
knowing that i'll soon
make the substance for myself.

322
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,966
have some coffee, sir.

323
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,135
thank you.

324
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:20,144
holland had great talent.

325
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:23,314
but talent does only what it can.

326
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:30,655
genius does what it must.

327
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:34,992
it is master of man, power absolute.

328
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,245
and in your hands, sir, how magnificent.

329
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,999
- how beautiful.
- yes.

330
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,503
the world will bow, or starve.

331
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:47,505
yes.

332
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,092
yes.

333
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:05,189
four, five, six.

334
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,694
- how many notebooks were there?
- six, i think.

335
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,448
but six ends with notes two weeks old.

336
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,118
it's unfinished.

337
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:21,372
there must be another,
a seventh notebook.

338
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,545
ferret has just radioed, sir.
something's happened.

339
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:29,380
what?

340
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,298
something about a...

341
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,719
well, you'd better
speak to him yourself, sir.

342
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,639
<i>(roar)</i>

343
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:51,402
- what?
- you're not gonna believe this.

344
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,988
something incredible
came out of the swamps.

345
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,656
what came out of the swamps?

346
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,743
some kind of animal or something.
it got the men.

347
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,829
we wouldn't be here
if it hadn't gone after the girl.

348
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,166
girl? you mean you let her get away?

349
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,367
uh-huh, here comes trouble.

350
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,788
hi.

351
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,125
you in a plane crash?

352
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,461
just been out walkin'.

353
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:52,505
uh-huh.

354
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,132
you got a phone that works?

355
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,067
<i>(woman) operations.</i>

356
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,237
this is 5-17. operation mount pisba.

357
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,864
get me my next immediate superior,
and hurry.

358
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,243
<i>hold on. i'm putting you through to ritter.</i>

359
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,121
<i>- i think he's been neutrali...

360
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,751
<i>(buzz)</i>

361
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:32,503
yes?

362
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,048
<i>this is mobile operator 3-4.
i have an emergency call for you.</i>

363
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:38,259
put the call through.

364
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:42,555
<i>ritter, this is cable.
we've had a catastrophe out here.</i>

365
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,597
what happened?

366
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,018
<i>there was a hit on the compound.
holland's dead. the lab's gone.</i>

367
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:50,688
<i>- i thought they got you, too.
- uh, no, i was called away.</i>

368
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:55,609
<i>i think you were wrong about arcane.
they knew what they were looking for...</i>

369
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:59,030
hold on, we'll get to you.
you can explain later. where are you?

370
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,782
a gas station a mile south
of the road to the landing.

371
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:03,367
right.

372
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:06,620
oh, uh, did you manage to save anything?

373
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,623
damn right. i got the last notebook.

374
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:13,461
very good.
i'll be there before you know it.

375
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:14,712
turn around.

376
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:42,782
- doesn't anything work around here?
- just me.

377
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,579
kickin' it don't help nothin'.
you gotta punch it.

378
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,088
- thanks.
- nothin'. name's jude.

379
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,756
cable.

380
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:15,439
nice station. your dad own it?

381
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,027
look like your ride's got here.

382
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:28,285
<i>(ferret) come on, let's go.</i>

383
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:38,879
don't be afraid.

384
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,550
say that to someone
whose desk you ain't hidin' behind.

385
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,721
is there a gun here?

386
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:50,391
what kinda place do you think this is?
course there is.

387
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:58,649
gun's a museum piece.

388
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:00,067
stay here.

389
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:04,238
took the words right outta my mouth.

390
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:09,994
hey, greaseball!

391
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,495
she's mine.

392
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,416
she's got a gun.

393
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:19,670
some gun. it blew up on the first shot.

394
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:36,854
jam it. jam it to the floor.

395
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,736
wait a minute. there she is.

396
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,781
go, go. go get her. go on.

397
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,033
go on.

398
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,499
watch the trees.

399
00:40:56,624 --> 00:41:00,044
go, go. come on,
she's gainin' ground on you.

400
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:31,993
faster.

401
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:45,339
got her in the sights.

402
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,760
- it's back! stop the jeep!
- run him down.

403
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,095
don't stop!

404
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,292
help!

405
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:39,310
shoo.

406
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,816
go!

407
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,010
it's ok, it's ok. it's just me.

408
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,012
jude, what are you doing here?

409
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:19,934
you think i'd stay at the station
while they're pumpin' it full of holes?

410
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:23,521
what happened to that thing?

411
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:26,023
it, uh...

412
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,776
hit a tree.

413
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:34,490
must have been one of those hit-and-run
trees. it don't seem to be there now.

414
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,620
some tree, all right.

415
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:44,875
there's a trapper's cabin nearby. maybe
we can get you a fresh change of clothes.

416
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:48,295
swamp's no place to be at night.
come on.

417
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:06,981
the last patrol is in. whatever it is,
it disappeared for the night.

418
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:10,568
some of the men say it's one of them
abdominal snowmen or something.

419
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:15,573
<i>(ferret) it was like hittin' a tree.
bullets hurt it, but they don't stop it.</i>

420
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,576
i say we forget this notebook.
it's not worth it.

421
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,162
what are we killin' ourselves for?

422
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,249
just to find a formula
to some ordinary plant fertiliser?

423
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:31,922
"ordinary"? something extraordinary
came out of the experiments already.

424
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:37,303
something that holland or myself
had absolutely no notion of. none.

425
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:52,860
would you recognise immortality
if it knocked on your door, gentlemen?

426
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:56,322
obviously you wouldn't,
but that's beside the point.

427
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:59,617
i want this swamp thing,

428
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:01,535
and i want the notebook.

429
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,913
- now.
- i'll get rid of him.

430
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:09,377
you will not get rid of him.
you will simply get him.

431
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:19,470
pure elements of the formula
that determines him are there,

432
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,888
in his veins.

433
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:25,017
but... how can we find it?

434
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,729
it's gone into the swamps.

435
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:32,650
every time you've seen the girl,
you've seen the beast, right?

436
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:33,985
that's right.

437
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:37,989
then we'll find the girl,
the beast will follow.

438
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:42,743
<i>it doesn't exactly maintain a low profile.</i>

439
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:44,912
<i>(anguished roar)</i>

440
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:17,445
he was right. it is beautiful.

441
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,114
who was right?

442
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:21,949
a guy i knew.

443
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,285
he loved these swamps.

444
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:28,122
can't you call him?
maybe he could come and get you.

445
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,127
ain't got nobody you can call, huh?

446
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,965
thought i had, but when i did
those goons showed up back there

447
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:41,969
and started making swiss cheese
outta your gas station.

448
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:46,223
- didn't pay your bookie or somethin'?
- or somethin'.

449
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,642
much farther?

450
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:52,313
a little ways.

451
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:01,382
- stay here.
- don't worry.

452
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,387
- if you hear anyone, you yell.
- don't worry.

453
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,641
and if i don't come,
just go on and get yourself out.

454
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:12,893
i can handle myself. don't worry.

455
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:16,230
i'm not worried.

456
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:18,899
well, i am.

457
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,663
- what happened?
- just go. go!

458
00:49:56,998 --> 00:50:01,752
we're just gonna do our job and get
this notebook back to washington.

459
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:03,754
the rest isn't my business.

460
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:35,680
local people
say this place is full of ghosts.

461
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:41,936
well, there's gonna be one more
before this day is through. there she is.

462
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:48,192
who's that?

463
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:51,112
<i>(roar)</i>

464
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:53,948
<i>who's that?</i>

465
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:56,951
that was that thing. let's go. come on.

466
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,796
what the heck's goin' on here?

467
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,468
cut the engine.

468
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:26,314
units one and two. sector four.
on the double. we got him cornered.

469
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,656
where is he?

470
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,326
<i>what is he?</i>

471
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,496
sh.

472
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,250
i think i see him.

473
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:57,011
hit it!

474
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:07,188
units one and two, where are you?
get over here on the double.

475
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:10,775
<i>split up. go in the back way.
we'll come in straight.</i>

476
00:53:19,784 --> 00:53:22,203
there he is. over there.

477
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,373
open up on him.

478
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,877
hang on.
i'm gonna knock him outta there.

479
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:38,636
jesus! unit two.

480
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:42,390
<i>use the grenades if you have to.
maybe we can stun him.</i>

481
00:53:57,655 --> 00:53:58,990
i think you got him.

482
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:04,495
he's still goin'.
give him everything you got. come on.

483
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,096
we've got him now.

484
00:54:35,276 --> 00:54:38,362
- where'd he go?
- i don't know.

485
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:55,629
<i>- do you see him?
- yeah, i see him everywhere.</i>

486
00:54:57,882 --> 00:54:59,467
any sign of him over there?

487
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,804
<i>nothing. we think maybe he bought
the farm... or the vegetable patch.</i>

488
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,156
what the hell is that?

489
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,513
he's smart. that thing is smart.

490
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,686
very smart, bruno. very smart.
this thing has considerable intelligence.

491
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:56,273
he's like a brilliant chess player.
he anticipates every move.

492
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:01,445
a strong adversary
is like a beautiful, dangerous woman.

493
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:04,865
i can't resist either.
tell the captain to weigh anchor.

494
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:08,619
- we're going home.
- no, we are not.

495
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,122
captured our knight.

496
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,625
exposed his queen.

497
00:56:16,377 --> 00:56:18,629
our move.

498
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:49,660
awfully quiet now.
we'd better get outta here.

499
00:56:49,744 --> 00:56:51,996
i've gotta go back and help.

500
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:59,420
you just take the notebook and get
to safety. i'll come back for you later.

501
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,672
go on, do as i say.

502
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,195
- cable!
- sh.

503
00:57:24,362 --> 00:57:30,284
jude, go and do what i told you.
it's not safe here any more. you hear?

504
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:31,452
jude?

505
00:57:41,796 --> 00:57:43,130
no!

506
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:46,193
oh, shit!

507
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,363
there goes the neighbourhood.

508
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:54,952
wait a minute. you're the dude
who saved us back there, right?

509
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:57,788
you a friend of cable?

510
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:00,207
then i got something for you.

511
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:02,960
she said i oughta put it someplace safe.

512
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,311
- where's arcane?
- below.

513
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,314
tell him we've captured his queen.

514
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:30,071
walked right into our hands, didn't you?
real smart.

515
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,658
thanks. i knew we couldn't rely
on your intelligence.

516
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,662
what i couldn't do for you.

517
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,500
tell you what,

518
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:46,253
tell me where the notebook is
and i'll get you outta the swamps.

519
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,091
- deal?
- i don't mind the swamps.

520
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:53,844
it's the slime that crawls out from
under the rocks that turns my stomach.

521
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,513
nasty mouth.

522
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,682
but a pretty one.

523
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:03,020
<i>what do you say to that?</i>

524
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:04,605
not much.

525
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:38,222
cable!

526
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:39,390

529

ferret!

530
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:26,687
- maybe we should go and check.
- no, we go home now.

531
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:29,440
- sir, but...
- home!

532
01:02:04,976 --> 01:02:07,061
that's very kind.

533
01:02:13,985 --> 01:02:15,987
nice orchid.

01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,585
much beauty in the swamp,

538
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:35,256

540
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:59,280
oh, i'm sorry.

541
01:03:01,115 --> 01:03:02,950
- it must...
- hurt?

542
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,039
does it?

543
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:13,294
only when i laugh.

544
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,403
have i gone crazy?

545
01:03:40,488 --> 01:03:43,824
isn't this a dream?

546
01:03:43,908 --> 01:03:47,828
that's what i keep asking myself.

547
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:53,834
everything's a dream

548
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,838
when you're alone.

549
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:04,345

get the hand down!

553
01:06:59,103 --> 01:07:02,940
a man who loves
gives hostages to fortune.

554
01:07:14,118 --> 01:07:15,536
alec.

555
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:18,122
alec... holland.

556
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:21,375
you knew, didn't you?

557
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:23,544
you knew we'd be caught.

558
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:29,633
the only way out is through.

559
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:54,408
<i>(upbeat sitar music)</i>

<i>(arcane taps glass)</i>

561
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:30,087
the occasion for this celebration is,
of course, known to you all.

562
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:36,427
we have captured the dragon,
and rescued the damsel in distress.

563
01:09:36,594 --> 01:09:38,929
we regret the loss of our friend ferret.

564
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:42,683
his frayed and volatile temper
has destroyed him.

565
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:45,853
nonetheless we regret his loss,
regret it deeply.

566
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:49,440
but to speak the truth, which is essential,

567
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:55,196
regrets are trifles
when one considers the grand design.

568
01:09:55,279 --> 01:10:00,618
and we are here tonight in celebration
of an event of profound significance.

569
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:03,537
the duplication of the holland formula.

570
01:10:10,378 --> 01:10:14,215
for this we must thank
the excellence of one man.

571
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:16,467
dear, dear bruno.

572
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,888
who won the notebook
from which we extracted the final secret

573
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:24,058
and topped it by capturing the beast.

574
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:37,989
so i propose a toast
to the keystone of our success.

575
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:42,994
to our conquest of the world. to bruno.

576
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:45,329
bruno!

577
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,758
but, sir...

578
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:03,097
have you tried it out on a plant? i mean,
when are we going to see the results?

579
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,765
tonight.

580
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:09,103
tonight, dear bruno. immediately.
but not on a plant.

581
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:11,856
<i>have you taken it?</i>

582
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:18,195
no, i have given the privilege
of taking the first dose of our formula

583
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:20,573
to our guest of honour.

584
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:23,743
he deserves the privilege thoroughly.

585
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:26,620
it is you, dear bruno,

586
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:30,624
who will tell us
whether or not the formula works.

587
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:37,548
<i>(whimpers)</i>

588
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:40,301

589
01:12:03,366 --> 01:12:05,826
- calm.
- help me!

590
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:08,079

<i>(women scream)</i>

593
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:33,187

<i>(moans)</i>

holland...

597
01:13:05,136 --> 01:13:06,929
holland.

598
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,558
you're there.

599
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,561
brain intact.

600
01:13:13,728 --> 01:13:16,355
all your abilities, everything.

601
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,984
plus the power, the physical strength.

602
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,822
bring him in.

603
01:13:27,408 --> 01:13:28,868
some friend you are.

604
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:33,039
sorry, bruno. it's every man for himself,
and... god against all.

605
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,551
why doesn't bruno have your strength?

606
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:53,434
we followed the notebooks religiously.
there can be no margin for error.

607
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:57,563
why doesn't bruno there
have your strength?

608
01:13:57,688 --> 01:14:00,650
because he never had it.

609
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:02,860
no riddles, please.

610
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:07,031
you will tell me,

611
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,699
or you'll pay.

612
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:11,869
and through a very dear agent.

613
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:15,748
bring her in.

614
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,464
the explanation, or her.

615
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:25,716
alec, don't.

616
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,222
which?

617
01:14:31,389 --> 01:14:34,725
you don't understand.

618
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:36,686
there's nothing hidden.

619
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:38,813
no secrets.

620
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,316
the formula works in so simple a way.

621
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:47,738
<i>what bruno took was what changed me.</i>

622
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:52,284
it only amplifies your essence.

623
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:59,542
it simply makes you more
of what you already are.

624
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:05,172
bruno's essence
was stupidity and timidity.

625
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:14,849
the formula simply extended, amplified
this to ridiculous forms and proportions.

626
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:22,106
he shrank.
he shrank to what he actually was.

627
01:15:24,442 --> 01:15:29,447
but if the essence is, let us say, genius,

628
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:35,286
then this genius shall be monumental
in body as well as in spirit.

629
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:37,455
is that what you're saying?

630
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:12,406

not to be the phenomenon,
but the thing in itself.

eternal, absolute beauty,
absolute strength and power,

634
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:17,031
physical and spiritual.

635
01:18:18,616 --> 01:18:21,535
