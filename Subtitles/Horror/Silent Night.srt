What the fuck did you...?

okay, just...

that she was married?

for all of us,

Daddy, I'm sorry I can't be here
tonight, but you understand.

100
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,252
That's okay, darling.
You just write

101
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,791
as many parking tickets as you can
for all those other wannabes

102
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,423
and then look for me
up on that throne.

103
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,790
Oh, well, that would be cheating,
wouldn't it, Mother?

104
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,791
- She's straight as an arrow.
- ( Laughs )

105

- I am proud of you, kiddo.
- Thank you.

There's a gift in the mailbox
for you, Hank.

107
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,730
Give it here.

108
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,607
Hey, Daddy,
what's a six-sided item?

109
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,168
Uh, a cube.

110
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,703
Mm, nine letters.

111
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,373
Uh, a hexagon.

112
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,213
Close. That's seven.

113
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,879
( Sighs )
I'll figure it out eventually.

114
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,286
Anyways, good luck.

115
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,655
I'm not gonna need it.
This is gonna be my year.

116
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,284
Of course it is.

117
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,659
And in the morning,
we will open up Christmas presents

118
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:09,133
and we will have leftovers and we'll
spend the whole day together, okay?

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,226
- You be careful out there, hon.
- Of course.

120
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,635
- You promise?
- Of course, Mother.

121
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,232
And watch out for those drunken Santas
with the wandering hands, eh?

122
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,971

174
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,015
John was important
to the community.

175
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,851
It's always hard

176
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,331
when a loved one leaves you,

177
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,267
no matter what
the circumstances,

178
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,203
but I want you to remember

179
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,537
Jesus loves you, Aubrey.

180
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,907
He's always here for you.

181
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,205
And so am I.

182
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,816
If there's anything

183
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:35,622
I can do to ease your pain,

184
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,959
anything at all...

185
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,073
I'm going to be late.

186
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,376
(door opens, closes)

187
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,595
(door opens, closes)

188
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,428
- ( "Jingle Bells" playing)
- ( Yawns )

189
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,331
You want me
to pour you a coffee?

190
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,235
No, it's okay.
I got it.

191
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,762
- What are you reading?
- A survey.

192
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,537
It says that Christmas
makes people crazy.

193
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,134
They think it's the short days.

194
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,340
Or maybe it's "Jingle Bells"
100 times before breakfast.

195
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,953
- Where is everyone anyway?
- Sheriff's out,

196
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,855
scouting the parade route
for suspicious packages.

197
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,381
And where is Giles?

198
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,188
Late, as always.

199
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,389
So you hear about Jordan disappearing?
He flew the coop.

200
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,159
Yes, that is why
I'm here today.

201
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,362
I mean, he couldn't have waited
until after Christmas?

202
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,662
Rumor is there's a girl.

203
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,069
They're eloping to Milwaukee.

204
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,903
Okay.

205
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,931
Of course they are.

206
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,348
Can you think of a nine-letter word
for a six-sided item?

207
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,979
For my crossword?

208
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,387
Ooh, I'll Google it.

209
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,358
What? No. The whole point is
to figure it out yourself.

210
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,260
( Sighs )
So why are you asking me?

211
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,225
It is just so nice of you
to show up, Giles.

212
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,034
Don't tell me... I missed a bank heist
and an alien invasion.

213
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,702
If I can manage to put on my makeup,
blow-dry my hair and get here on time...

214
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,440
The truth is,
I had to stop at the store

215
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,176
and get something
for you ladies.

216
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,115
Christmas presents
from you? Really?

217
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,552
Don't rush me.
Form a line.

218
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,355
Oh, after you've been kissing
the sheriff's asshole, you're gonna...

219
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,682
- ( sneezes )
- Oh, God.

220
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,885
No, thank you.

221
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,258
(phone rings)

222
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,059
Sheriff's Department.
Yes.

223
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,033
Ma'am, which Santa Claus?
Ma'am?

224
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,798
I see.
We'll send someone right over.

225
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,538
You know that traveling Santa,
the one in the square?

226
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,436
- Yeah. What's up?
- Well, seems he's been making kids cry.

227
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,873
- What? How?
- Maybe he got a boner.

228
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:09,836
Ugh.

229
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,712
Kids are squirming
in his lap all day.

230
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,581
It's bound to happen
sooner or later.

231
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,144
Has anyone ever done
a background check on you, seriously?

232
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,884
I'll just take this one
on my own.

233
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,482
What did I say?

234
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,863
(bell ringing)

235
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,373
- Hey.
- Hello.

236
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,872
- Hi there.
- How are you?

237
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,577
Fine, thank you.

238
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,556
- Ho, ho, ho, Aubrey, Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Merry Christmas.

239
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,318
Hi.

240
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,466
Looks great. Good job.

241
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,399
Man: Happy holidays.
Merry Christmas.

242
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,016
Man: So what's your name,
partner?

243
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,849
- Boy: It's Timmy.
- Timmy. (chuckles)

244
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,821
Well, to be honest, Timmy,

245
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,052
I don't think you deserve
anything this year.

246
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,560
L.m joking...

247
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,688
You're gonna get everything
on your Christmas list,

248
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,097
but if the presents aren't
under the tree tomorrow,

249
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,965
you know what happened,
right? Hmm?

250
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,029
Well, see, your parents took 'em
and they put 'em on eBay.

251
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,801
That's right.
Never trust your parents.

252
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,039
And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter,

253
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,014
lest I get in trouble
with the police.

254
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,277
See, they send people
to check on me

255
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,286
to make sure I'm not telling kids
the truth about their parents.

256
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,652
So don't go snitching on me.

257
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,679
Santa's little secret, right?
Shake.

258
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,988
All right, superstar.
Now scoot.

259
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,791
Santa sucks.

260
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,229
Ho, ho, ho!
What can I do for you?

261
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,361
- I'm Deputy Bradimore.
- I'm Santa... Santa Claus.

262
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,099
Do you go by any other names?

263
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,198
Yeah, sure.
At Easter, I'm the Easter Bunny.

264
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,233
On Halloween, I'm Halloweener...
an Irish-Jewish ghost.

265
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,176
Days between, I'm Jim Epstein.

266
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,874
And can I call you Jim Epstein?

267
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,011
Well, you could if you wanted to ruin
the childhoods

268
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:28,911
of all those cute little brats
waiting in line, looking for reassurance

269
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,946
that they're gonna have lots and lots
of toys under the tree come tomorrow.

270
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,513
Oh, a cynical Santa... cute.

271
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,024
Ooh, you're good.
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.

272
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,823
You're not from around here,
are you?

273
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,490
No, I'm from up north, a small town...
North Pole actually.

274
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,362
And Colorado.

275
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,925
- You move around a lot?
- What the hell is this?

276
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,767
Why the inquisition?
I have a permit.

277
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,295
Can I see it?

278
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,934
Well, it happens to be
in my journal,

279
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,968
because I'm a bit of
a passionate scrapbooker.

280
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,780
( Clears throat)

281
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,780
Mind if I take a look?

282
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,254
Knock yourself out.

283
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,451
For 10 bucks
you can sit on my lap too.

284
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,051
And we'll talk about
the first thing that pops up.

285
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,085
So what's the big issue?

286
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,827
We've been getting some complaints
about your behavior towards children.

287
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,467
Well, if you're talking about
that whiny little brat back there,

288
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,237
I stand by what I said.

289
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,740
I speak the truth.

290
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,265
So what do you want Santa
to bring you, huh?

291
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,075
A pony? How about
a big fucking box of reality?

292
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,605
- How about you tone the fuck down?
- Oh, yeah? Or what?

293
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,108
You can't revoke my permit.
It was issued by town hall.

294
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,553
It's conditional upon
your adherence to public decency.

295
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,750
Ooh, now I'm scared.

296
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,385
The big cop lady knows
the letter of the law.

297
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,759
So how come
you're not at home tonight,

298
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,128
by the fire with your hubby,
baking cookies?

299
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,557
What did you just say?

300
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,433
- ( Radio crackles)
- Brenda: Base, patrol one.

301
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,495
Deputy Bradimore, come in.

302
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,140
Patrol one, over.

303
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,738
Uh, we got a call
from some carolers

304
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,774
about a bad smell coming from
that abandoned house on Watson.

305
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,184
It's probably a gas leak
or a dead raccoon.

306
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,189
You have to send Giles.
I'm with Santa.

307
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,316
Giles is busy.

308
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,952
Aubrey: Doing what?
Changing his maxi pad?

309
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,361
A missing persons' report for
Alana Roach. Her husband is here.

310
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,126
Something happen to her?

311
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,828
Mm, I think she left him
for Deputy Jordan.

312
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,166
- Where did you get that from?
- Gossip.

313
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,535
From who?

314
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,040
Seriously,
I never reveal my sources.

315
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,018
Brought you a newspaper.

316
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,078
Couldn't finish the sudoku.

317
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,553
Mom and Dad missed the flight,

318
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,188
so it's just me.

319
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,596
I guess it kind of sucks

320
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,357
being in here alone
on Christmas Eve, huh?

321
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,465
Hell, you don't even know
what day it is.

322
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:14,315
Anyway, I gotta go see Tiffany.

323
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,452
You remember
my groupie Tiffany, right?

324
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,980
I'm boning her
pretty regular now.

325
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,153
- ( 93595 )
- You'd better watch out, boy.

326
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,632
Christmas Eve is the scariest
damn night of the year.

327
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,658
Gramps, holy shit.

328
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,035
You're awake.
Let me go get someone.

329
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,406
You see Santa Claus tonight, boy,
you'd better run.

330
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,911
Run for your life.

331
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,504
( laughs )

332
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,482
( knocks on door)

333
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,180
My grandfather... he's awake.

334
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,924
- Mr. McKenzie?
- I swear. He just said something.

335
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,988
Mm. Mr. McKenzie,
it's time for your bath.

336
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,490
Man: He's catatonic.
He hasn't said anything in over a year.

337
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,271
Do you want to help?

338
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,673
I'm running kind of late.

339
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,580
( Crows cawing )

340
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,782
(car approaching )

341
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,525
Ugh.

342
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,476
(door squeaking )

343
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,456
( exhaling )

344
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,491
It's disgusting.

345
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,270
Jesus.

346
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,852
( Gasps )

347
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,363
( water dripping)

348
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,564
(flies buzzing)

349
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,056
( exclaims )

350
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:14,721
( retches, coughs)

351
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,199
( panting )

352
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,909
- ( radio bleeps)
- Patrol one, over.

353
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,935
Brenda:
Base. What's the problem?

354
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,074
It's Deputy Jordan.
He's... he's dead.

355
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,845
Brenda:
Are you sure?

356
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,546
I'm pretty damn sure.

357
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,112
He's wrapped
in exploded Christmas lights.

358
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,250
Brenda: Oh my God. What do you mean?
Like electrocuted?

359
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,657
Oh, shit.

360
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,720
You said Alana Roach was with him,
right? I need to go search the house.

361
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,129
Brenda: That does not sound
like a good idea.

362
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:54,564
Wait for backup. Whoever did it could
still be there. I'll send Sheriff.

363
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,595
(cocks gun)

364
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,544
Ah, shit.

365
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,822
(thud )

366
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,959
(cell phone ringing)

367
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,017
(ringing continues)

368
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,064
(ringing continues)

369
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,111
( exclaims )

370
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,344
(rustling, squelching)

371
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,512
( exclaims )

372
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,695
( boards squeak)

373
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,831
Bradimore, whoa, whoa.
Jesus, stand down.

374
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,268
Jesus.

375
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,147
Do you want to go home?

376
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,445
No.

377
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,747
You're shaking.

378
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,187
Shivering. It's cold.

379
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,521
You should have waited
for me to come.

380
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,389
I had to make sure
that she was okay.

381
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,055
Look, I'm gonna say this
for your own good.

382
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,531
You're not equipped to handle
this kind of situation.

383
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,194
I mean, we both know that.

384
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,138
So don't go playing the hero.

385
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,200
That's my job.

386
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,041
Oh, Jesus.

387
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,946
What a bloody mess.

388
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,953
Whew.

389
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,891
Whoa, a big fella.

390
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,329
See, I guess that's what happens
when you try to start a new life.

391
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,356
I told him she was bad news.

392
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,336
I mean, fuck, she was screwing
half the bloody town.

393
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,066
Where's the husband now?

394
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,303
Oh, waiting for the bars to open
so he can get drunk.

395
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,436
- Should we go talk to him?
- Huh? No, Giles already did.

396
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,812
He was at the auto shop all day.
The boss confirms it.

397
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,841
No, he didn't do this.

398
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,875
Well, then who did?

399
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,289
That level of brutality-
it has to be personal, okay?

400
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,919
A stranger just
doesn't make any sense.

401
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,122
Murder seldom does.

402
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,157
All right, see what you can get
off those footprints.

403
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,162
I'm gonna set up our own
command HQ.

404
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You realize
with Calumet Road closed,

405
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,963
that we're just completely
on our own?

406
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,803
Good. No state troopers, no FBI,
no "CSl: Miami."

407
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,542
This is payback time
for those parking violations

408
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,483
and stray cats up trees.
And I'll tell you another thing:

409
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,876
This sick fuck is gonna wish
he never set foot in my town.

410
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,278
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Work it, work it.

411
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,316
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Work it, work it.

412
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,760
Oh, yeah, lean back.

413
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,264
Oh, that's awesome.
You look amazing.

414
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,856
Work it, work it.

415
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,926
Oh, that's it, that's it. Okay.
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

416
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,001
Oh, baby, you're beautiful.
Stretch your neck out.

417
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,329
Stretch your neck out.
That's it. Ow!

418
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,672
Looking like an angel today.

419
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,569
Frank is very very...
feeling it, baby.

420
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,913
- ( Woman laughs ) God, Frank.
- ( Laughs ) That's right.

421
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,043
( Shorts )

422
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,883
So your website
can only be seen in Europe?

423
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,690
In Europe and Asia.

424
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,287
Awesome.

425
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,866
Oh, your present's over there,
white envelope.

426
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,767
Goldie:
Girl, you rocked it.

427
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,902
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, have a great one, babe.

428
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,081
- Mwah. Whoo!
- Maria: Later, honey.

429
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,408
(bells jingling)

430
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,492
Creep.

431
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,238
Maria, baby!

432
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,241
- Ooh, ooh, that's good, the tits.
- You want it off?

433
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,005
- Work the tits. Yeah, perfect.
- Yeah, I'll take it off.

434
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,603
Work the tits. Work the tits.
Work the tits.

435
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,875
Oh, God. Yeah, that's it.

436
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,077
That's it. Oh, man.
You're looking great. That's good.

437
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,643
( Knocks on door)

438
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,923
Tiffany must have
forgotten something.

439
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:51,257
Or maybe the Snowman's back.
We're running low.

440
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,624
- ( Knocks on door)
- Goldie, get the door.

441
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,825
Okay, okay.

442
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,306
Hey.

443
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,609
What's this?

444
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,321
God, that's amazing.
Look at that. That's unbelievable.

445
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,950
You're looking perfect.

446
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,603
Frank?

447
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,765
Yeah, that's it.
What?

448
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,037
Frank, run!

449
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,028
( Shrieks )

450
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,506
No.

451
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,540
(gunshot)

452
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,981
( panting )

453
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,435
- ( men grunting)
- ( Objects crashing )

454
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,807
(man grunts)

455
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,104
Frank?

456
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,374
- ( Bells jingle)
- ( Screams )

457
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,124
( coughs )

458
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,176
(machine whirring)

459
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,360
( screaming )

460
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,211
( muttering )

461
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,984
Help me. Help me!

462
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,223
No!

463
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,864
Bastard! No. Please.

464
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,393
No! No!

465
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,770
Somebody help me, please!

466
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,741
Anybody!

467
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,610
No, no. No!

468
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,204
Help me!

469
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,341
No, no.

470
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,578
No! No!

471
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,883
(screaming ) No!

472
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,913
(continues screaming )

473
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,362
( loud grinding)

474
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,903
Please!

475
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,883
( "Joy to the World" playing )

476
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,394
Well, the prints came from
a Cumberland work boot, size 13,

477
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,691
so it's definitely not Jordan.

478
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,720
Brenda: They didn't deserve
what just happened.

479
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,792
- Well, somebody thought differently.
- What do you mean?

480
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,928
What I mean is that this wasn't
like a random,

481
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,099
spontaneous act of violence.
Whoever did this had a plan.

482
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,268
And whoever had a plan
had a reason.

483
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,972
Well, who do you think
could have done this?

484
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,606
Do you remember that article
that you were reading to me

485
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,446
about Christmas making
people crazy?

486
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,850
Holiday murders...
Google that.

487
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,377
(phone rings)

488
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,550
Sheriff's Department.

489
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,958
It's Crazy Betty.
She sounds a little crazy,

490
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,326
something about blood.

491
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,228
Yeah, a Bloody Mary,
most likely.

492
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,164
- ( Phone rings)
- She's been drinking, guaranteed.

493
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,190
Sheriff's Department.

494
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:08,830
Crazy Betty again?

495
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,773
No, a Mrs. Monuood
over on Euclid.

496
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,799
I'll go check it out.

497
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,278
Wait, no.

498
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,043
I'll go to the Monlvoods'.
I know the family.

499
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,450
Bradimore, you head down to the motel.
Giles, you meet her there.

500
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,818
- Brenda: Yes, ma'am. Right away.
- I really don't feel well enough

501
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,686
to be fighting crime.

502
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,817
I'm probably best sewed
just holding the fort.

503
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:34,262
No, you are best served protecting
the good citizens of Cryer

504
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,663
instead of your own sorry ass.

505
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,963
So man up.

506
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,803
(siren wailing)

507
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,104
What happened here?

508
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,079
- She's dead.
- No.

509
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,710
He skewered her
like a little pig.

510
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,346
What?

511
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,878
Did you see him?

512
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,760
I'm really sorry.

513
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,697
I promise you that we'll
catch this maniac

514
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,759
and he will pay
for what he did.

515
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,795
- It's all my fault, Sheriff.
- No.

516
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,501
- She was driving me crazy.
- It's all right.

517
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,771
All I wanted for Christmas
was some relief,

518
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,575
but I was talking about
boarding school.

519
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,275
I didn't mean this.
I didn't want this.

520
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,306
It's all right. It's okay.

521
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,820
I deserve to go to jail.

522
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,014
No, no, no.

523
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,887
- Take me in.
- Stay there.

524
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,621
Wait. Don't go in there.

525
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,063
Once you see it,
you can't unsee it.

526
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,676
- ( Radio bleeps)
- Bradimore, Giles, come in.

527
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,876
We have another homicide
on Euclid.

528
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,579
A 14-year-old girl
appears to be speared.

529
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,451
What do you see?

530
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,151
Aubrey: Two dead here, sir.
There's a woman, Goldie Willis,

531
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:46,127
and a Frank Forrester.
He runs a website, soft porn.

532
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,656
Sheriff: Porn, drugs...
when did this town become so sleazy?

533
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,190
Ever since the mill closed.

534
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,998
They do what they gotta do
to survive.

535
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,267
Oh, yeah?
You call this survival?

536
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,468
And, sir, we found prints...
work boots.

537
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,671
- They're huge.
- Looks like the same perp.

538
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,442
Aubrey: The woman... Goldie Willis...
she was the first one to die.

539
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,416
There was no sign of forced entry.
Whoever did this...

540
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,612
she must have known him.
I mean, she opened the door.

541
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,020
The last call that Frank made
was to a Mr. Snow.

542
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,388
That doesn't ring a bell.

543
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,553
I know a Mr. Cloud,
but he's Indian.

544
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,497
Native American.

545
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,296
All right, son, listen.
I want you to lock up the crime scene.

546
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,792
Oh, and check out
that rat-infested motel.

547
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,966
Somebody may have heard
or seen something.

548
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,670
Sir, there's a video camera.

549
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,975

Maybe we'll get lucky.

Thank you.

571
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,877
Hi, Dennis.

572
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,614
Shouldn't we call in some help?

573
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,386
It's Christmas Eve.

574

And assuming they could
give a damn,

575
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,560
it would be midnight
before anyone showed up.

576
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,793
No, we're just gonna have to
take this maniac down ourselves.

577
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,733

Yeah. Later.

582
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,982
- Maybe we should fast-forward it
- Hmm? What?

583
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,213
- Fast-fonuard.
- Oh.

584
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,213
I'm just... I'm just making
a mental note to call the mayor.

585
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,658
- About the killings?
- No, about his daughter.

586
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,152
You know, just don't want to scare
people unnecessarily.

587
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,223
But he's gonna find out sooner or later.
I mean, people are gonna be talking.

588
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,565
He'll find out
when I find the killer.

589
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,232
Never present to your superiors

- Giles.
- I'm on my way in.

Listen, we've got a lead
on our killer from the motel.

600
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,146
Yeah, he's wearing a Santa's suit
and a mask.

601

Well, that narrows it down, man.
The town square is like Santa central.

602

Listen, this one's big, all right?
Size 13 boots, over 6 feet. Anyone

603
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,624
matching that description... you bring
him in immediately for questioning.

604

I'm gonna need some help.

It's just a few words really.

613
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,178
It's about the ugly side
of Christmas,

614
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,478
how we surround ourselves

615
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,984
with colored lights
and decorations,

616
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,715
snow globes and gift wrap,

617
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,745
how we convince ourselves

618
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:18,055
that everything
is fun and laughter.

619
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,426
Dig a little deeper, friends.

620
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:24,331
Christmas has a dark side too.

621
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,494
Remember that chilly night
in Bethlehem

622
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:31,802
when baby Jesus was born
into this cold world

623
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,436
and laid in the filth
of a manger,

624
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:41,281
when King Herod
massacred infants?

625
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,086
Christmas has
some bad memories too.

626
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,421
To truly appreciate
the beauty of Christmas,

627
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,722
you must understand
its ugliness.

628
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,663
Sin is the beating heart
of Christmas...

629
00:45:55,686 --> 00:46:00,358
pain and war, fear and sickness,

630
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,733

631

the kind of thing

00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,877
a serial killer would be partaking of
after five homicides.

672

a few questions?

the last time you were at the motel.

00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,662
she won't even know
if I fuck her in the ass.

697
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,305
You don't seem very happy
about Christmas, do you?

698
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,742
Let me tell you
about Christmas.

699
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,144
It ain't all candy canes
and pretty lights.

700
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,506
Christmas can fuck you up.

701
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,952
I heard this story.

702
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:51,149
This fella was pissed
that his wife left him

703
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,355
on account of him being
a dull man.

704
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,955
She took up with
a more exciting fellow.

705
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,194
The husband was distraught.

706
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:05,198
He went to the party
they were at

707
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:11,477
dressed as Santa, took
with him a weapon,

708
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,345
one he made with his own hands.

709
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,884
And he set about
killing them that was naughty.

710
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,551
( Screaming )

711
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:29,862
The wife's boyfriend ran,
left her behind.

712
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,567
She begged for forgiveness,

713
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,869
pleaded for her life.

714
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:43,310
He had no mercy for sinners,

715
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,540
burnt 'em to a crisp.

716
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,628
He's still doing it too,

717
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,697
every year a new town.

718
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,976
Everyone knows that story.
It's an urban legend.

719
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,071
It ain't.

720
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,685
Have you been
a naughty girl, Deputy?

721
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,268
(dialing)

722
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,271
(cell phone rings)

723
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,107
Who put you onto me?

724
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,704
Was it Frank, that creep?
That kid Dennis?

725
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:55,410
Just stay calm.

726
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,475
- ( Radio bleeps)
- Karsson is Mr. Snow.

727
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,078
Hey.

728
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,320
Stop.
I can work this out.

729
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,120
You can't work shit out.

730
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,990
( Screams )

731
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,996
- ( siren wailing)
- Shit.

732
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,799
Are you hurt?

733
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,039
No.

734
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,804
- Where do you think he went?
- Wherever he feels safe.

735
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:04,216
Well, I'm on his tail now.

736
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,777
There's nowhere safe.

737
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,758
(sucks in air)

738
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,158
Ah, shit.

739
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,959
(sucks in air)

740
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,767
.( phone beeps)
- ( Line rings)

741
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,361
- Hello.
- Dad.

742
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,135
Hi, princess.
Let me get your mom.

743
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,732
No.

744
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,766
I really need to speak to you.

745
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,746
What's going on?
You sound upset.

746
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,172
I'm not cut out for this job.

747
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,243
Are you kidding?

748
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,050
I spent 40 years on the force.

749
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,181
I know what makes
a good cop, Aubrey.

750
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,214
I'm not.

751
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,694
I can't do it.

752
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:51,460
I mean, maybe before
I lost John

753
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:56,335
I thought that I was brave

754
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,806
and intuitive like you, but...

755
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,874
I'm not.

756
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,210
I choked.

757
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,149
Dad, I choked.

758
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,209
Trust your gut.

759
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,243
When the time comes,

760
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,381
you'll know what to do.

761
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,159
(sighs)

762
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,256
Listen, don't go to the parade
tonight, Dad.

763
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,994
We have a situation
with one of the Santas

764
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,298
and he could be
really dangerous.

765
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,396
But don't tell Mom.
I don't want her to worry.

766
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,498
She doesn't have to worry.

767
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,531
This isn't the first time

768
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,408
a Bradimore had to bring down
a bad Santa.

769
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,505
You'll find him.

770
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,745
You'll catch him.

771
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,774
Good bye.

772
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,284
("O Tannenbaum" playing
on radio )

773
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,189
Public enemy number one.

774
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,927
- It's double S.
- Is it?

775
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,458
Karsson... it's double S.

776
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:04,529
Double S...
double screwed.

777
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,407
Listen, the bars will close.
The whole town shuts down.

778
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,776
He can run, but he can't hide.

779
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:14,304
I want this son of a bitch
behind bars before dawn,

780
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:16,078
or my aunt's my uncle.

781
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,710
I'm not so sure, Sheriff.

782
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,482
You're not so sure
about what, Deputy?

783
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,785
About Karsson.
He doesn't stack up.

784
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,052
- To what?
- As a suspect.

785
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,653
Don't put avocado
on the burger.

786
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:28,890
What?

787
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,990
Simple is always best.

788
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,992
Look, Karsson killed
Jordan and Alana,

789
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,528
then those two degenerates
at crazy Betty's motel.

790
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,405
Hell, he even tried to kill you,
didn't he? Have you forgotten that?

791
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:44,776
But Karsson was a coke dealer.
Why would he want to kill his clients

792
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,805
and what would be his motive
for killing Alana and Jordan

793
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,511
and the Monuood girl?
It doesn't make sense, sir, I'm sorry.

794
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,147
There you go again. Now you're
piling hummus on top of the burger too.

795
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,020
What if he was punishing them?

796
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,854
He knew Alana was cheating
on her husband.

797
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,259
He knew that Frank and Goldie
were making porn.

798
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:03,025
And who would know all that?

799
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,157
Someone they knew.
Someone they trusted.

800
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,168
You mean, like a drug dealer?

801
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,568
Sir, a drug dealer with morals?
Come on.

802
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,572
All right, I read
Brenda's magazine.

803
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:15,303
Christmas... the number one holiday
for people going nuts.

804
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,402
That's motive enough for me.

805
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,506
So I want you to get out there
and I want you to search every street.

806
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,539
Come on.

807
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,812
Past homicides around the holidays,
state by state.

808
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,345
Thanks.

809
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,255
Double S, my ass.

810
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,394
(sighs)

811
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,015
Aubrey.

812
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,619
Joe, hi.

813
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,257
What's this I hear about a dead guy
over on Watson?

814
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,097
Someone said the body was
electrocuted.

815
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,270
I don't know anything
about that.

816
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,510
I didn't believe it either.

817
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:32,547
- ( Radio bleeps)
- ( Quietly) Karsson's here, close.

818
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,953
I can smell it...
the smell of fear.

819
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,755
Aubrey:
I don't smell it.

820
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,760
No. Well, that's not because
you are not attuned.

821
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:45,823
A crime fighter's senses

822
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,632
switch to something
almost primeval,

823
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:53,766
from when we hunted cave bears
and dinosaurs.

824
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,572
Sheriff, listen,
I have an article

825
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,102
from Metesca, Montana,
five years ago,

826
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:02,742
December 26th,
a multiple homicide.

827
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,877
The journal of the Santa from
"The Real Christmas Show"

828
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:07,650
puts him in Metesca
at the same time.

829
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,554
So?

830
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,718
We're looking
for the wrong Santa.

831
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,887
Epstein, we're coming in!

832
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,594
Sheriff:
Jesus, what a pigsty.

833
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,167
He lives in here?

834
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,105
Aubrey: No, he travels in it.
He's living at the motel.

835
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,405
What a smell.

836
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,604
See if you can find
any weapons.

837
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,940
We're looking
in the wrong place.

838
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,915
Just who the hell
do you think you are, Deputy?

839
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:43,391
Don't you tell me
how to suss out a perp,

840
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,451
not when you choked
the one time you had the chance.

841
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,985
I fucked up.

842
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,227
Okay? I fucked up, sir.

843
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:55,998
I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

844
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,108

Now you go get ready
for bed, okay?

861
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,662
Only if you say good night.

862
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,925
I will.
(chuckles)

863
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,467
( laughing ) Come here.

865
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,100
Tiffany says
you finished the guesthouse.

866
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,840
It's a doozy...
two bedrooms and a full bath.

867
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,870
I'm gonna show him.

868
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:16,247
- Make it snappy.
- Oh, yeah.

869
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,549
I want us all to drive into town
for the parade.

870
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:21,885
This won't take long.

875
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,800
Mayor Revie.

876
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,871
Hi, sir. I just wanted
to wish you a Merry Christmas.

877
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,884
Merry Christmas, Sheriff,
to you and the whole department.

878
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,887
Thanks for another year
of keeping our town safe.

879
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,082
Sheriff: I wanted to talk to you
about that, sir.

880
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:57,489
We have reason to believe

881
01:01:57,513 --> 01:02:00,460
that we have a serial killer

882
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,759
at large in our community.

883
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,287
(straining)

884
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,800
Yes, I know, sir.
It is shocking.

885
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,825
I am doing everything
in my power

886
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:12,670
to make sure that this maniac
doesn't strike again.

887
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,107
You're breaking up, sir.
I can't...

888
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,372
Hello? Hello?

889
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,676
Hello.

890
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,651
- ( Phone beeps)
- Bloody cell phones.

891
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,685
Tiffany:
Poor Santa Claus,

892
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,213
giving out a million gifts,

893
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:34,058
never getting anything in return
except stale cookies.

894
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,887
It's true.

895
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,264
Santa gets shafted.

896
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,291
Well...

897
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,199
it's time to give back.

898
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,973
I'm gonna lighten Santa's sack.

899
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,511
Ho, ho, ho.

900
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:01,248
(chuckling)

901
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,690
It looks like Santa's gonna
come early this year.

902
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,526
- ( Door opens)
- Shit.

903
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:12,897
Is that my dad?

904
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,924
Don't stop.

905
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,206
I have a surprise for you.

906
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,232
Stay here.

907
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,772
(giggling)

908
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:37,218
- Have you been bad?
- Fuck, yeah, I have.

909
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,189
I'm ready when you are, killer.

910
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:21,959
(door squeaks)

911
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,011
Okay, I'm not laughing anymore.
You can...

913

914
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,492
You should have seen your face...
classic.

915
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,856
How did you get over here
without me seeing you?

916
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,889
Get over where?

917
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,801
How did you get
from the bathroom

918
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:59,238
to the other side of the bed
without me seeing you?

919
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,868
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't in the bathroom.

920
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,969
Okay, so the door opened
by itself?

921
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,311
Stop trying to scare me,
asshole.

922
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,612
You know what?
I'm over this now.

923
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,142
Fuck. Come on.

924
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:15,712
Look, there's nothing.

925
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,747
Come on, stop fucking around
and let's...

926

928
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,436
Let me out of here!

929
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,633

930

937
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:36,286
Sheriff: He's a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

938
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,457
hiding in plain sight.

939
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,127
Aubrey: I'll call Brenda,
get a vehicle description

940
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,262
and a license plate
for Jim Epstein.

941
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,294
Sheriff: He's Santa Claus,
remember?

942
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,705
The parade is
the perfect cover.

943
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,074
Nah, he'll be on foot.

944
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:55,573
- ( Radio bleeps)
- Is there any way

945
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,277
we can call off the parade?

946
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,308
I spoke to the mayor, told him

947
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,184
I had the situation
under control.

948
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,690
Listen, this freak
can't hide forever.

949
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,852
Sooner or later
they all make mistakes.

Fake-ass Santas.

956
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,261
Shit, are you seeing this?
It's Epstein.

957
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,462
Man: Hey, look out, man.
Come here.

958
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,806
Shit, he's making a run for it.

- ( Crowd screaming )

960

- Is that a gun?
- Get out of the way.

961
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,022
Man: Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho!

962
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,295
Father: Merry Christmas.

963
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,939
Oh.

964

- Hold still!
- Freeze!

965
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,121
You nasty,
sadistic little prick.

966
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,130
See?

967
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,393
I told you I'd get him.

968
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:53,923
Cuff him.

969
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,370
Get over here.
Cast your mind back,

970
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:00,101
Christmas, '08.
Remember where you were?

971
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:03,599
Probably some herpes-ridden
crotch of a town like this, I suspect.

972
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:06,374
- Sheriff: Deputy.
- Metesca, Montana.

973
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:09,906
Does that ring a bell
in that dumb skull of yours yet?

974
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:13,182
My mind is blissfully bereft
of the effects of campanology.

975
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,850
Yeah, well, four people were
murdered there Christmas Eve.

976
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:19,257
The cops never found the killer.

977
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:24,496
Judicial ineptness is
a universal curse. I fucking weep.

978
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,194
Yeah, well, six people
died here tonight.

979
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:31,069
I ask you,
what are the chances?

980
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,471
I'd say the odds of that
are pretty high.

981
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:40,407
Because it's that time
of the year, Sheriff.

982
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:43,679
Yeah, Christmas,

983
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:45,947
when people
go off the deep end.

984
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,977
Yeah, you know why.

985
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,115
'Cause they spend too much

986
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,022
and they drink too much
and they eat too much

987
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:54,027
and they think too much.

988
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:56,256
And they look around at all that
fake fun and happy laughter

989
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:59,459
and they go, "Where the fuck
is my cup of joy, huh?

990
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,526
Where is my figgy pudding?

991
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,629

Where's my fancy cologne?

995

Where's my gift-wrapped
Norman Rockwell wife,

996
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:19,178
huh, and my beautiful,
happy, smiling children?

997
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,210
Where?

998
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,189
Nowhere.

999
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,214
Where are my friends,

1000
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:28,126
my beaming friends who worship
the fucking ground I walk on

1001
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,426
because I've had an awesome
fucking year, man?"

1002
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,296
And it doesn't take much
to put people over the edge, huh-uh.

1003

Mm-mm, just a dirty look

or a TV too loud

or some asshole behind you
leaning on his horn.

1006

Ring-ring! It's a telemarketer,
"Give me money for Haiti,"

or the Democrats,
or National Suck-My-Dick Week.

It's the most wonderful
fucking time of the year!

But whatever it is
that you guys think I did,

1010
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:01,283
I most certainly did not.

Charles Manson?

I don't understand
how he did it.

1015
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,858
How does he go from
hearing kids' wishes

1016
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,883
to going on a killing spree?
It just...

1017
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,693
it doesn't make sense.

1018

I told you before,
murder seldom does.

1019

I want you to go look for
that other girl from the motel

1020

and see if you can find
any more evidence.

You're good at that, yeah.
