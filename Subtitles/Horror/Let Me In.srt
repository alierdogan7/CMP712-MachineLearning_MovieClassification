00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:39,210
(Discordant vocalizing)

00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:26,123
(wind whistling)

3
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:05,031
(sirens wailing)

4
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:09,939
(tires screeching)

5
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:25,454
(man panting, wheezing)

6
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:27,925
131 to dispatch, come in.

7
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,622
(Radio waves squealing)

8
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:40,700
(man panting, snarling)

9
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,765
Medic:
Hey hey hey hey!

10
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,144
(Men grunting)

11
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,445
Man over radio:
131, this is dispatch. Go ahead.

12
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:52,917
Man: This is 131.
We have a male, mid-50s,

13
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:55,614
with burns over 9% to 9.5%
of his body.

14
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,852
Prior to our arrival on scene,
patient apparently doused his head,

15
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:02,019
neck and face with some sort of
highly-concentrated acid.

16
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:05,519
The patient's airway is severely
compromised due to fume inhalation.

17
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,294
Vital signs unstable.

18
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,824
Please advise- patient is
a criminal suspect.

19
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:12,269
We're coming in
with a police escort right now.

20
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:14,535
(Banging, man snarling)

21
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,379
(respirator hissing)

22
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:32,084
(knocks)

23
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:35,583
Hi.

24
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:37,459
Can I talk to him?

25
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:42,563
He can't actually talk.

26
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:49,006
(Sighs)

27
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,306
All right.

28
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,175
Jesus.

29
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:55,180
Can I just have
a few minutes with him?

30
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:25,438
(Respirator hissing)

31
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,027
(paper rustling)

32
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,971
(sighs)

33
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,483
We want to know who you are.

34
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:08,947
We'll find out, you know,
sooner or later.

35
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:13,220
So just save us some legwork
by communicating with us now.

36
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:17,558
Are you a Satanist?

37
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:21,294
Are you involved
in some kind of cult?

38
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,700
'Cause if there's others involved,
we'll get them.

39
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,533
We'll find them, believe me.

40
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,340
- (Heart monitor beeping rapidly)
- What's the matter?

41
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,276
Is that it?
That's it, right?

42
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,712
Is there somebody you want
to tell me about?

43
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,683
(Patient wheezing)

44
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,482
(footsteps)

45
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,681
Woman: I'm sorry,

46
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:45,122
the nurse at reception
downstairs is on the phone.

47
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,649
She wants to talk to you,
says it's urgent.

48
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,419
Okay.

49
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,856
(Distant TV chatter)

50
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,739
I'll be right back, okay?

51
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,579
(Patient breathing heavily)

52
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,985
President Reagan:
Thank you very much...

53
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,458
Detective: Yeah.

54
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,927
Reagan:
...Reverend Clergy all,

55
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,759
Senator Hawkins...

56
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:27,197
His daughter?
When was this?

57
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,498
- Is she still here?
- (Monitor beeping rapidly)

58
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,136
Well, did she leave
any information,

59
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:39,110
a phone number?

60
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,040
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?

61
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:45,642
(Nurse screaming)

62
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,648
- (woman whimpering)
- Officer: Dispatch, this is Baker 17.

63
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,658
I’m gonna need
a medical backup.

64
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,490
(Wind rushing)

65
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,488
Jesus, Mary, Joseph.

66
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,558
Man: Somebody help!

67
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:25,856
President Reagan:
There is sin and evil in the world,

68
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,826
and we're enjoined by Scripture
and the Lord Jesus

69
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:31,421
to oppose it with all our might.

70
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:34,956
Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil
with which it must deal.

71
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,266
The glory of this land
has been its capacity

72
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,670
for transcending the moral evils
of our past.

73
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:43,334
Alexis de Tocqueville
put it eloquently

74
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,606
after he had gone on a search
for the secret

75
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,546
of America's greatness
and genius-

76
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:51,550
when he said: "Not until I went
into the churches of America

77
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:55,748
and heard her pulpits
aflame with righteousness

78
00:07:55,788 --> 00:08:00,623
did I understand the greatness
and the genius of America."

79
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,959
America is good.

80
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:07,261
And if America
ever ceases to be good-

Bless us O Lord
for these Thy gifts

95
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,224
which we are about to receive.

Amen.

98
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,329
So how was school today?

99
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:32,043
You didn't go and spoil your dinner
on me now, did you, Owen?

100
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:33,642
No.

101
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,677
- Owen, sweetie-
- No, I didn't.

00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,712

00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,225
Eat, please, honey.

104
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,528
Hello.

105
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:47,555
What?

106
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,569
Look, I’m not gonna
discuss this now, okay?

107
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,265
We're eating dinner.

108
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,841
We had an agreement, John.

109
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,643
I think maybe you'd better
call my lawyer, okay?

110
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,424
Don't talk to me like that!

111
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,421
I will not be spoken to
in that way.

112
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,259
Preacher over radio:
...Judgment to fall.

113
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:26,863
And if we as a people
turn back to God...

These are the young people.

The young people are beginning
to turn back to God

117
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:40,241
Who's waiting on them.

118
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:42,550
If the Lord calls you,

119
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:43,987
then the Word comes.

120
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,355
And the Word came
from the Lord...

121
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,927
Hey little girl.

122
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,422

Okay, Kenny, 10 laps now.

Now!

- Ow.
- (Boys laugh)

That's why he won't
go swimming.

163

As some of you may have heard,

242

there was an incident
last night

243
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,752
and one of your recent
graduates here was killed.

(Boys snickering, whispering)

245

I want to assure you that
we're doing everything possible

246
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:52,629
to find those responsible
for this tragedy.

247
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:56,065
But in the meantime
we need you all to be on the lookout

248
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,831
for any suspicious activity,

249
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,703
because your safety

250
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,573
is our number-one concern.

to be left alone.

- Me too.
- So leave.

255
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:44,915
You leave.

Yeah.

00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:17,740
Want to try it?

264
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:20,580
You can give it back tomorrow.

265
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,950
How do you do it?

266
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,794
You gotta get each side
one color.

267
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,434
Like that.

00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:03,652
- Jesus Christ, dude.
- What?

369
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:05,457
You explain that to his mom.

370
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,169
It’s okay.

371
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:17,272
She's not going to tell her mom
on us, is she?

372
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,640
She fell down on the playground,
that's all.

373
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:21,907
Right?

374
00:38:23,514 --> 00:38:25,539
Right?

375
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:29,244
Say it, little girl.

376
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:31,311

Come on, man, let's go.

379
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,497
Owen: I fell down
on the playground.

380
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:49,506
You have to be more careful,
okay, honey?

381
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:52,573
(Kisses)

382
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,204
I hate to see my baby
get hurt.

383
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,939
Bless us O Lord
for these Thy gifts

384
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:01,645
which we are about
to receive.

385
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:04,711
Please guide and direct us for all
our days and protect us from evil.

386
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:10,225
Okay look, I made one for you
and one for me.

387
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,667
Are you reading this?

388
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:20,329
Yeah, it's for school. It’s boring.

389
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,066
Come on, look at this.
It’s really cool.

390
00:39:23,707 --> 00:39:25,834
We can talk to each other
through the wall.

391
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:32,747
Can you hear me
through the wall?

392
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:41,690
Only sometimes.

393
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:44,990
Did you hear anything
the other night?

394
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,696
Why was your dad so mad?

395
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:02,376
Where's your mom?
Are your parents divorced?

396
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:04,244
My mom's dead.

397
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:13,548
My mom and dad
are getting a divorce.

398
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:19,895
What happened there?

399
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:26,531
Just some kids from school.

400
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,869
Where do you go to school anyway?
I’ve never seen you-

401
00:40:29,907 --> 00:40:31,568
Owen, listen.

402
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:34,674
What?

403
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:37,613
You have to hit back.

404
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:40,048
You have to hit back hard.

405
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,949
I can't.

406
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:46,047
- There's three of them.
- Then you hit back even harder.

407
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:50,790
Hit them harder than you dare

408
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,659
and then they'll stop.

409
00:40:52,696 --> 00:40:54,288
What if they hit me back?

410
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:56,322
You have a knife.

411
00:40:56,367 --> 00:41:00,167
Yeah, and what if that
doesn't stop 'em?

412
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,101
Then I’ll help you.

413
00:41:06,944 --> 00:41:09,606
But you're a girl.

414
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:19,478
I’m a lot stronger
than you think I am.

415
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:39,472
I have to get in there.

416
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,535

(moaning)

551
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:02,767
Jett:
Greg was in there.

552
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:04,302
- Man: What?
- Jett: He was in the car!

553
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:07,908
Jett: Hey!

554
00:55:27,403 --> 00:55:28,700
Greg.

555
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,039
Greg!

556
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:40,177

(announcer speaking on radio)

561
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:10,739
An unidentified man
has been arrested in connection

562
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,715
with the recent ritual murder
of a local high school honor student.

563
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,184
The suspect is hospitalized
in critical condition

564
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:19,746
with severe self-inflicted acid burns
over his face and torso

565
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:23,281
making it impossible so far for
authorities to determine his identity.

566
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,157

Thank you.

572
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:46,945
Abby: Excuse me,

573
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:50,043
I’m looking for my father.

574
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:51,951
Is he a patient here?

575
00:56:54,123 --> 00:56:56,819
Yeah, they-

576
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:59,225
they brought him in.

577
00:57:00,597 --> 00:57:02,588
The police did.

578
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:05,601
Oh, I see.

579
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,626
Do you know where he is?

580
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:11,197
Well, he's on the 10th floor,
sweetie, but it's restricted.

581
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:12,936
Look, why don't we give them
a call and tell them-?

582
00:57:12,976 --> 00:57:15,069
No no, that's okay.

583
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:24,285
Oh my God, the poor girl.

584
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:28,184
Sweetie, sweetie!

When was this?

593
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:11,510
Is she still here?

594
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:18,852
Well, did she leave
any information,

595
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:20,920
a phone number?

596
01:00:22,465 --> 01:00:25,059
What do you mean a little girl?
How little?

605
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:26,560
Owen.

606
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:29,588
Owen.

607
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:31,623
Hmm?

608
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,999
Abby: Can I come in?

609
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:36,902
No no no, wait wait.

610
01:01:36,939 --> 01:01:39,339
Don't look at me.

611
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,576
But you have to say it-

612
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:45,478
that I can come in.

613
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:47,506
You can come in.

614
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:48,881
Close your eyes.

615

617
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,066
How did you get up here?

618
01:02:39,735 --> 01:02:41,396
I flew.

619
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:43,701
Yeah, right.

620
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:48,369
Hey, you're not
wearing anything.

621
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:53,039
And you're freezing.

622
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:55,380
Is that gross?

623
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,246
No.

624
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:02,320
Abby...

625
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,486
Yeah?

626
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:11,057
Will you go steady with me?

627
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,625
What do you mean?

628
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:15,660
Will you be my girlfriend?

629
01:03:15,705 --> 01:03:19,471
Owen,

630
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,169
I’m not a girl.

631
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,804
You're not a girl?

632
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,609
No.

633
01:03:25,648 --> 01:03:27,172
What are you?

634
01:03:31,253 --> 01:03:33,244
I’m nothing.

635
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:35,951
Oh.

636
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:38,927
You know, it's okay
if you don't want to be my girlfriend.

637
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:41,054
You don't have to make stuff up.

638
01:03:46,802 --> 01:03:50,294
Look, can we just keep things
the way they are?

639
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:53,502
Yeah, sure.

640
01:03:56,812 --> 01:04:00,714
Well, do you have to do anything

641
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,741
special

642
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:04,776
when you go steady?

643
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,482
No.

644
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:10,389
So everything's the same?

645
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:12,018
Yeah.

646
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:17,295
Okay.

647
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,801
We can go steady.

648
01:04:19,835 --> 01:04:21,735
Really?

649
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:24,797
Yeah.

650
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:43,515
(Birds chirping)

651

(Children chattering)

653
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:30,335
Zoric:
Slow down.

654
01:05:30,372 --> 01:05:32,340
Hockey you play
in the center;

655
01:05:32,374 --> 01:05:34,171
Free skating over that side.

656
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,610
Now, everyone,
careful of holes in ice.

657
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:39,239
Stay away from the holes.

658
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:44,977
I hope you've been learning
how to swim,

659
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,045
'cause today
you're going in.

660
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,677
Go.

661
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:21,713
Bring it up
and start passing.

662
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,748
Pass pass pass.

663
01:06:28,497 --> 01:06:30,362
Over here.

664
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,506
What do you think
you're gonna do with that?

665
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:43,842
I’m gonna hit you with it

666
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:45,870
if you try anything.

667
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:47,906
Really?

668
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:50,441
Wow.

669
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:53,182
You know what I think?

670
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:56,316
I don't think you're gonna do
a fucking thing.

671
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:01,428
I think you're just gonna stand there
like the little girl you are.

672
01:07:01,463 --> 01:07:05,456
And I’m gonna grab that stick
and ram it right up your ass.

673
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,527
And then

674
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:10,596
you're going swimming.

675
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,900
I want to hear click-click-click-click.

676
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:22,380
Bully: Shit, dude. Zoric's right
over there checking us out.

677
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:25,683
Let it go.
We'll beat his little ass later.

678
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:28,554
Give me the stick.

679
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:34,024
Give me the stick.

680
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:36,054
Argh!

681

682
01:07:40,002 --> 01:07:42,766
Jesus Christ,
are you fucking crazy?

683
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:44,363
Hey!

684
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:45,600

01:08:08,731 --> 01:08:11,632
Okay okay, just move.
Please, just move back.

01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:13,225
Move back.

689
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,886
Woman: Give me one reason
why I shouldn't suspend you, Owen.

690
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:40,487
Can you think of one?

691
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:44,655
Don't you know
what could have happened?

692
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:48,565
You seem like a smart kid.

693
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:51,198
I just don't want to see you
going down the wrong path.

694
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,538
He's a good boy.

695
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:55,702
He really is.

696
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:59,305
- (Doorbell ringing)
- Mother: Hello, is John there?

697
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:02,044
Excuse me, this is his wife.
Who is this?

698
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:05,951
Hello, Cindy.

699
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:08,286
Will you please tell John
that I called?

700
01:09:09,892 --> 01:09:11,450
Detective: Hey there.

701
01:09:11,493 --> 01:09:13,324
Is your mom and dad home?

702
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,353
Yeah.

703
01:09:15,397 --> 01:09:17,388
Mom!

704
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:19,424
(Mom hangs up phone)
What?

705
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:24,098
- Oh.
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

706
01:09:24,139 --> 01:09:26,699
- What's this about?
- I’m afraid there's been an incident

707
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:28,869
with one of your neighbors
here in the complex.

708
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:32,074
So we're just going around, talking to
everybody to see if they know anything.

709
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:34,139
What kind of incident?

710
01:09:36,852 --> 01:09:38,717
Owen, why don't you
go to your room?

711
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:48,823
(Indistinct conversation)

712

- Boy: Sorry, guys.
- Jeez, could you take any longer?

724
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:01,160
- I said sorry.
- Come on, let's go play Centipede.

725
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,596
Kenny: Man, why are you even
in that class? It’s so gay, dude.

726
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:04,792
Boy: Whatever.

727
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:06,926
Hey! Stop!

728
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:09,995

- Stop! Hey!

729
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:11,403
(Boys laugh)

730
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,305
Jesus Christ, dude, watch out.

731
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:17,073
Man, that kid whaled on your ass.
Can you still hear me, bro?

732
01:12:17,112 --> 01:12:18,340
Stop.

733
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,007
Are you going home?

734
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:23,245
No, we're going over
to Mark's.

735
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:25,276
Can I borrow your keys?
I forgot mine.

736
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,651
Please.

737
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,517
Give me the fucking keys.

738
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,661
Thanks.

739
01:12:36,698 --> 01:12:38,689
- See you at home, little girl.
- Hey.

740
01:12:38,734 --> 01:12:40,759
(Boys chuckle)

741
01:12:43,438 --> 01:12:44,598
Kenny: Shut up.

742
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,540
- We didn't say anything.
- Shut up.

743
01:12:52,047 --> 01:12:55,210
Owen: Abby, I did it.

744
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,480
You did what?

745
01:12:57,519 --> 01:12:59,612
They were gonna push me
in the hole in the ice,

746
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:02,818
so I got a really big stick and I hit
Kenny in the head really hard.

747
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:04,689
He had to go to the hospital.

748
01:13:04,726 --> 01:13:07,456
I almost got suspended,

749
01:13:07,496 --> 01:13:08,986
but I didn't.

750
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:11,261
What you said-
I stood up to them.

751
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:16,999
Owen.

752
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:18,404
Yeah?

753
01:13:35,524 --> 01:13:39,654
Hey, you want to go somewhere?

754
01:13:39,695 --> 01:13:41,322
Where?

755
01:13:41,363 --> 01:13:44,264
(Children's laughter
and footsteps echoing)

756
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:55,041
(door squeaks)

757
01:13:55,077 --> 01:13:57,102
(light switch clicks)

758
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:01,175
(echoing)
It’s pretty cool, huh?

759
01:14:01,216 --> 01:14:02,581
Yeah.

760
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:05,212
This kid that used to live
in the building-

761
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:07,245
Tommy-

762
01:14:07,289 --> 01:14:10,087
he would come down here

763
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,389
and drink and smoke
with his high school friends.

764
01:14:12,427 --> 01:14:14,759
And when they weren't here,

765
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:17,162
he'd play ping-pong with me.

766
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,531
He was really cool.

767
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,967
But then he had to move away.

768
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,373
I kind of like it here.

769
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:32,308
It’s cool.

770
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:35,111
And I don't think any of the adults
know about it-

771
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:37,516
it's just us.

772
01:14:39,254 --> 01:14:41,586
(Turns on stereo)

773
01:14:41,623 --> 01:14:44,717
(pop song playing)

774
01:15:01,476 --> 01:15:04,809
So what did you want to do
down here?

775
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:08,642
Uh...

776
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:11,175
I think I have an idea.

777
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:13,050
Close your eyes.

778
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:15,780
Keep them closed.

779
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:32,730
Let's make a pact.

780
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:36,642
It only hurts for a second.

781
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:39,844
Here.

782
01:15:39,881 --> 01:15:43,248
(Music sounds distorted)

783
01:15:48,523 --> 01:15:50,514
(exhales)

784
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:53,119
(growling)

785
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:02,230
Abby?

786
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,704
(Growling, panting)

787
01:16:19,354 --> 01:16:21,185
(deep voice)
Go away.

788
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,169
- (Dog barking)
- Man: Virginia.

789
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:42,142
(Abby panting)

790
01:16:42,177 --> 01:16:44,441
Man:
God damn it, Virginia.

791
01:16:46,381 --> 01:16:48,679
- Virginia!
- (Abby growling)

792
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:55,111
(screaming, dog barking)

793
01:16:58,393 --> 01:17:00,987
- Man: Get-
- (Abby growling)

794
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:03,088
off!

795
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:08,759
Man: Hey.

796
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:11,170
- Hey.
- (Dog barking)

797
01:17:17,412 --> 01:17:19,903
Somebody call 911!

798
01:17:19,948 --> 01:17:22,974
(Police radio chatter)

799
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:25,612
(people chattering)

800
01:17:54,182 --> 01:17:56,173
Mom?

801
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:02,914
Mom.

802
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:09,389
(Phone line ringing)

803
01:18:09,431 --> 01:18:11,194
John over phone:
Hello?

804
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:13,793
Dad,

805
01:18:13,835 --> 01:18:16,030
can I talk to you?

806
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:19,006
John: Yeah sure, pal.
What is it?

807
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,372
Do you-

808
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:25,510
do you think

809
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:29,210
there's such a thing as evil?

810
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,617
John: What?

811
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:35,422
What are you talking about, pal?

812
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,450
Can people be evil?

813
01:18:39,494 --> 01:18:41,962
Listen, where are you getting
all this stuff?

814
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:44,625
Is this from your mother-

815
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:47,499
- all her religious crap?
- No.

816
01:18:47,536 --> 01:18:49,163
You know what, Owen?
Listen listen,

817
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:51,764
put your mother on the phone,
okay? I want to talk to her.

818
01:18:51,806 --> 01:18:53,330
She-

819
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,366
she's not here.

820
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,878
All right, she's not-
okay well, please tell her to call.

821
01:18:57,913 --> 01:19:01,781
Just tell her to call me
when she gets back, all right?

822
01:19:01,816 --> 01:19:03,943
Okay?

823
01:19:03,985 --> 01:19:05,247
Dad.

824
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:08,188
Owen, I want you to get that crap
out of your head, okay?

825
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:10,088
Your mother- she-

826
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,389
listen, look, she has problems.

827
01:19:12,427 --> 01:19:14,725
And I’m gonna talk to her.

828
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:17,027
So I don't want to hear
any more of this.

829
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:18,760
All right?

830
01:19:21,336 --> 01:19:23,668
All right?

831
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:24,899
Yeah.

832
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:27,272
You have a good night, pal.

833
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,300
I love you.

834
01:19:29,344 --> 01:19:31,778
I’m sorry about the last
couple of months, you know?

835
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:34,475
But I’ll see you soon-
real soon, okay?

836
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:37,280
I promise.
Maybe next weekend.

837
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:39,378
Owen: Mm-hmm.

838
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:45,487
I love you.

839
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:47,927
(Clicks, dial tone)

840
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:52,557
(crying)

841
01:19:56,037 --> 01:19:57,265
(doorbell rings)

842
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:09,940
Can I come in?

843
01:20:16,491 --> 01:20:18,083
You have to say it.

844
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:28,692
You can come in.

845
01:20:56,998 --> 01:20:59,489
(Exhales)

846
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:03,470
Are you a vampire?

847
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:12,408
I need blood

848
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:13,880
to live.

849
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:17,510
But how old are you- really?

850
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:20,112
12.

851
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:23,124
But...

852
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:26,286
I’ve been 12
for a very long time.

853
01:21:26,327 --> 01:21:28,761
(Distant radio chatter)

854
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:40,299
Where's your dad?

855
01:21:44,512 --> 01:21:46,844
He wasn't my dad.

856
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:00,959
What's all this stuff?

857
01:22:00,995 --> 01:22:03,623
I like puzzles.

858
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:29,847
I want to go now.

859
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:32,524
I want to go.

860
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,358
Are you gonna let me?

861
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:40,601
What are you gonna do to me?

862
01:22:44,105 --> 01:22:46,539
I told you we couldn't be friends.

863
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:51,209
(Receding footsteps)

864
01:23:06,895 --> 01:23:09,090
(P.A. chatter)

865
01:23:17,138 --> 01:23:18,696
(knocks)

866
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:24,408
Hi. Are you Larry?

867
01:23:24,445 --> 01:23:26,470
Can I talk to you for a minute?

868
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:30,874
Sure.

869
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:43,295
Detective:
I’m sorry to bother you.

870
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:45,697
How is she doing?

871
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:48,463
Larry:
It’s been quite a night.

872
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,965
They had to give her
over six pints of blood.

873
01:23:53,007 --> 01:23:55,339
We're just waiting to see
if her body rejects it.

874
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:01,038
Detective:
Well, I won't keep you long.

875
01:24:01,082 --> 01:24:04,813
I just- I need ask you about
the description you gave

876
01:24:04,853 --> 01:24:07,378
of the little girl.

877
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:10,186
You said that she had
long blonde hair,

878
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:13,524
she was 12 years old

879
01:24:13,561 --> 01:24:15,654
and she wasn't wearing
any shoes.

880
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:17,164
- Right?
- That's right.

881
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:19,632
Have you ever seen this man?

882
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:29,099
He's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

883
01:24:29,143 --> 01:24:31,475
Larry: Looks like a guy
from our building.

884
01:24:31,512 --> 01:24:33,844
Did he have a daughter

885
01:24:33,882 --> 01:24:35,816
like the girl you described?

886
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:37,909
I don't know.
I’ve only seen him a few times.

887
01:24:37,952 --> 01:24:40,750
(Sucking, swallowing sounds)

888
01:24:40,788 --> 01:24:44,189
Why? Do you think this has
something to do with your murder case?

889
01:24:44,225 --> 01:24:46,693
Maybe. We're starting to think
that some of them might be involved

890
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:49,253
- in some sort of Satanic cult.
- What?

891
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,265
We found another body
a few days ago-

892
01:24:51,299 --> 01:24:53,927
same MO,
victim completely drained of blood.

893
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:56,300
There were two bite marks,
small ones,

894
01:24:56,337 --> 01:24:58,669
on the victim's neck-
just like a little child's.

895
01:24:58,706 --> 01:25:00,765
Larry: Jesus Christ.

896
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:03,834
(Sucking)

897
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:12,215
(sizzling, screaming)

898
01:25:12,253 --> 01:25:13,379
Oh!

899
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:26,288
- Virginia, Virginia.
- Stay back. Stay back.

900
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:30,405
(Fire alarm ringing)

901
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,306
(stove beeping)

902
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:35,070
(switch clicks,
plate sizzling)

903
01:25:35,109 --> 01:25:37,134
Owen: Oh- mm.

904
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:40,170
(Distant TV playing)

905
01:25:47,121 --> 01:25:49,214
We're told one patient
was killed in the fire

906
01:25:49,257 --> 01:25:52,886
as well as one hospital nurse.
The five-alarm fire started

907
01:25:52,927 --> 01:25:55,760
on the eighth floor of the hospital
and took most of the day

908
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:57,594
- for crews to contain.
- (Knocking on door)

909
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,226
The official cause is still
under investigation.

910
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:09,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

911
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:21,848
You have to invite me in

912
01:26:21,889 --> 01:26:23,880
to your home.

913
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:27,122
What if I don't?
