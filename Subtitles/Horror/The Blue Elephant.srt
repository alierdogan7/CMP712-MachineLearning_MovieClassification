"The Blue Elephant"

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Maya!

3
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Maya!

4
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't forget to close the tap, Ok.

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,700
Maya!

6
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
Maya!

7
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,400
Darling, don't forget to close the tap.

8
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Ok.

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
"New Evidence Related to the
Islamic Museum Robbery"

10
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,000
Was the islamic museum robbed?

11
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,000
When was the last time you
read a newspaper?!, Boss.

12
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,900
Almost 5 years.

13
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
5 years!!, this happened 3 months ago.

14
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,000
The bastards spent like a gazillion pounds
renovating it and at the end it got robbed.

15
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,900
They should have spent the money
rehabilitating the junkies filling the streets.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,900
Indeed.

17
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,200
"Al Abasya Psychiatric Hospital"

18
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Dr. Safaa'!

19
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,000
Welcome Yehia!

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
didn't you miss the hospital?

21
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
I missed the hospital and the patients.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,900
Have a seat.

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What would you like to drink?

24
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,000
Coffee, half a spoon of sugar
and a glass of water, please.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,500
Coffee, half a spoon of sugar.

26
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
How are you doing?

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Still staying alone.

28
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,400
There is no...

29
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,400
No, there isn't.

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,500
I am more comfortable alone.

31
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Thanks.

32
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,100
Welcome.

33
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Her eyes are fixed.

34
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,800
Pretending to be busy.

35
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,300
Nervous.

36
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
Preparing to attack.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Yehia!

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Now, you've completed
5 years absent from work.

39
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,500
Of course I am keeping out the legal
affairs because of your circumstances.

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But last week, the inspection committee
was going to take a legal action.

41
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,500
if it weren't for my intervention.

42
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
I won't allow anyone to
accuse me of prejudice.

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,100
But, what upsetted me more

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,300
is knowing that you have not
submitted a single paper of your thesis.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the matter, Yehia?!

46
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
No work and no thesis!
What's left, then?!

47
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Sorry doctor, the research
consumed a lot of time.

48
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Tell me that the PhD is not important
I can understand that.

49
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,100
You can survive without it.

50
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,400
And you can apply for
any fellowship abroad.

51
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
But work, is it also not important?!

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,900
I finished a considerable
part of the thesis.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
You have been saying the
same thing for the past 5 years.

54
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you know what this means?

55
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,600
It means that you are ending your
career at the stroke of a pen.

56
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,500
Yehia!, I am not only
the hospital manager.

57
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
I regard myself as your elder sister.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
The best I could do
to avoid your dismissal

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
is to let you back in
and you have to attend.

60
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
And this will be a special
exception made for my sake.

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Come back?, where?

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,600
Come back to the hospital.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,600
But...can we postpone it
till I complete my thesis?

64
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
My offer is a package
take it wholly or leave it.

65
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,600
Your legal situation is
the most important issue.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
If you will attend, that's ok.

67
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,600
If not, I will testimony that
you shall not work again.

68
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,800
And keep searching for someone to hire you

69
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,600
after you get fired from a distinguished
hospital like "Al Abasya".

70
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Ok, doctor.

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,200
As you please.

72
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, only choosing a suitable
department is left.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Intermediate Care...full.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have a vacant place
in the senility department.

75
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,000
No, please!, I won't stand
the bedwetting, doctor.

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,100
What do you think about "8 west"?

77
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,200
The unstable building?

78
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,500
No, your information is
not up to date, then.

79
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
"8 west" is the most
secure prison in Egypt, nowadays.

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Something befitting psychotic criminals.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,900
The least dangerous of them, killed his
whole family with cold blood.

82
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,600
Escaping it, is virtually impossible.

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,700
What's so funny?!

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,500
I am laughing, because you inteneded
to admit me to "8 west" from the beginning.

85
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,500
So you proposed the senility
and the bedwetting.

86
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,700
So that I will easily agree on the prison.

87
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,000
What was the subject of your thesis again?

88
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,000
"Psychoanalysis Through Body Language"

89
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,700
Then, instead of experimenting
what you studied on us.

90
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,000
Use that knowledge in your thesis, doctor.

91
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
I will try to.

92
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
Yehia!

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,800
You were one of the best doctors we had.

94
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,500
No one can forget the tough
cases that you treated.

95
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,000
It will be a great loss
if you waste all of that.

96
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Check "8 west" new building
before you leave.

97
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,000
"8 West Division"

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes, sir.

99
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Dr. Yehia Rashed.

100
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,300
One second.

101
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
He is saying that he is a doctor here
in "8 west", but I never saw him before.

102
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,500
"Men's Building (a)"

103
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Dr. Yehia Rashed.

104
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Dr. Yehia!, welcome back.

105
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,600
I knew from the management that you
will be joinging us, starting today.

106
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
Seriously?!
I've been here for 5 mins only!

107
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,900
How are you doing, Mohsen?
and how is your family?

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,700
Fine, thank God!

109
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,700
Come on in, doctor.

110
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,900
The building was divided into:
(a)Dangerous, (b)Normal, (c)Females.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We have 73 cases
61 of them are accused of murder.

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,500
This is the criminals affairs room.

113
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
And this is the head of
department office, Dr. Kilani.

114
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,000
And this is the room for inspection and
following up, where the committee meets.

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
And this is the doctors room.

116
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,700
Come on in, doctor.

117
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Thanks, Mohsen.

118
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,100
Welcome, boss.

119
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,200
We really missed you
and missed your good days.

120
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Dr. Sameh is arriving anytime, now.

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,100
Sameh who?!, Zidan?!

122
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, should I make tea?

123
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,300
Make dark black coffee, and boil it, Mohsen!

124
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,300
At your service.

125
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,400
Smoking is not allowed in here.

126
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
How are you?, Yehia!

127
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,300
How are you?, Sameh!

128
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Welcome back.

129
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,000
Thanks!

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
You've lost a lot of weight.

131
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,700
But, you have a bigger belly, though.

132
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,900
What happened to your hair?
are you getting bald or what?

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And your nose!, why did it become so big?

134
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
How are you Sameh!

135
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,700
You are here with us in "8 west"?

136
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,300
I am here since 4 months.

137
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,100
I am the oldest in the division now.

138
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,900
After the committee, of course.

139
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,000
Breakfast?

140
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Thanks.

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,000
But, you couldn't find a place
better than "8 west"?

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,300
You should have chosen something simple...

143
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,900
Administrative works...

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,300
or Mental Retardation.

145
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
Maybe you forgot the profession.

146
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,700
My fate!

147
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Tell me, what's new?

148
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,100
The whole building is new.

149
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,000
Come, I will show you around
Come with me.

150
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Come.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Inside!, all of you.

152
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,100
Sit down!

153
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,500
This is Saed, he killed his wife

154
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,500
skinned her and put her in the fridge

155
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,500
he will be sent to
"Al Khankah Hospital" tomorrow.

156
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,000
And this is Fox.

157
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,300
He killed a 3 year old girl, first raped her
and then slaughtered her.

158
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,500
On the other hand, Abdul Majeed poisoned
his parents then set them on fire.

159
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,900
He thought they kidnapped him.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,400
And this guy...

161
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,000
What guy!, enough please Sameh
that's good enough.

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,900
See you tomorrow.

163
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
How are you?, Naguzi!

164
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Is Mr. Awni here?

165
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,500
Doctor!, where have you been lately?

166
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,700
I don't know why you make me feel
like you are my wife.

167
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,000
It would be my honor, if you were a chick
I wouldn't leave you for a moment.

168
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,000
What?!, you will make me doubt you
I was just kidding.

169
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,400
No hasish?

170
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,500
Of course.

171
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,000
But listen!, not in front of Shakir and
Mouris they will be upset like last time.

172
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,300
As if hash is the worst of your deeds.

173
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,100
Don't worry, we will get
a joint outside, come, come.

174
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,900
This one is free.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Sure.

176
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,200
Poker is my favorite sport.

177
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,100
And reading the players body
language is the best practice.

178
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,000
A couple of days ago
I was staying in a hotel.

179
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,400
Waiting for some people on lunch.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,500
One glass after the other.

181
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,900
I saw a hot chick, coming through.

182
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,400
A Russian chick!, you can't imagine.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Her body, that perfect.

184
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Her eyes!, WOW!, I can't describe it!

185
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
She passed by me, and smiled.

186
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,300
And went to play on the piano.

187
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,000
She kept playing for around half an hour.

188
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
She didn't stop looking
at me for a moment.

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,100
After she finished, I saluted her
and gave her a hundred pounds tips.

190
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,900
Where are you from?...I am from Russia...
where are you staying?...

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Blah blah blah...I went down to
the reception to reserve a room.

192
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
The best 2 hours of my life!

193
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,200
The whore screamed like hell.

194
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
She exposed me!

195
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,800
Even the room service came up
and asked if there was a problem.

196
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,600
I told them no worries, it was just the TV.

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,900
Then...

198
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,300
We continued till...like 2:00 AM.

199
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,400
She didn't want me to leave.

200
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,600
Saying that they don't have the like of
the Egyptian stamina in their country.

201
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,600
They are fond of the Egyptian stamina!

202
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Tell me doctor...

203
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,200
What is your analysis of this situation?

204
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,100
I don't think it's a good idea
we are here to play.

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,300
No, really, what is your explanation
for this great attraction?

206
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
Or maybe poker made you
forget your profession?

207
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,900
Tell the story in reverse.

208
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
In reverse?!

209
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
I mean tell the events as they
happened in a reversed order.

210
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
In order to analyze this great
attraction, Mr. Shakir.

211
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
hmmm...

212
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,400
The girl didn't want me to leave
she liked the Egyptian stamina.

213
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
She screamed...

214
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,900
What about the room service
and the movie playing on TV?

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,900
Yeah, right, the room service first
and then..hmmm..the restaurant...

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,100
No...the reception
and the room reservation.

217
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,100
Yes, the reception, sorry.

218
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
I was waiting for the guests...

219
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,000
You gave her tips, and spoke with her
and before that their was the lunch meeting.

220
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
At what time did this
whole story take place?

221
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,000
3:00 PM.

222
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,900
And you stayed till 2:00 AM?!

223
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,500
11 hours!...you are a legend!

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Yeah...hahaha

225
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,900
But this whole thing is bunk.

226
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,900
Bunk?...what do you mean?

227
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Bunk...I mean a lie.

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,000
The whole time you are checking our eyes
to make sure that we believe you.

229
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,300
And you rubbed your nose when you
mentioned the room reservation.

230
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,800
This was a lie
and your body refused to believe it.

231
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,700
And now you are turning red.

232
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,200
And trying to swallow.

233
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
You feel exposed.

234
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,200
Mr. Shakir, there is a 90% probability
that you have sexual weakness.

235
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,000
Which you are trying to hide
by making up stories.

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Awni!

237
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,800
I am sorry Mr. Shakir
but you are the one who asked for it.

238
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,000
I am out.

239
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,600
Not me.

240
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,500
Full ROI.

241
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,800
Old Man.

242
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,000
Full Ace.

243
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,200
The Egyptian stamina!

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,900
Dr. Yehia!

245
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,400
Who?...uncle Sayed!

246
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,300
How are you good old man?

247
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
He knows that you are coming back.

248
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,100
It is destined for us to meet by the tree.

249
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,700
hmmm..what happened to
this tree, uncle Sayed?

250
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I heard it screaming
while they were severing it.

251
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,000
You are very good, old man, very good.

252
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,400
Look how lucky you are.

253
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,100
I brought you this shirt, I want you to
tailor it properly and make it looks good.

254
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,200
I swear, it is imported, look!

255
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,700
It's a gift for you.

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,100
Peace be upon you!

257
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,000
Good morning!

258
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
Seems like it was a good night.

259
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,500
Are these genuine Italian glasses?

260
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,900
I have similar ones, but...

261
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
Get lost Sameh, I have a bad headache.

262
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,600
Get lost!, choose a better language.

263
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,000
We are here to work.

264
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,900
There are 2 newly admitted suspects.

265
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
Choose one of them, when you sober up.

266
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,600
Mohsen!

267
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,700
Mohsen!

268
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,200
Where are the 2 new cases?

269
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,100
One of them is there.

270
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,900
And the other one, Sherif Al Kurdi, there.

271
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,700
Sherif?

272
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,700
Sherif!...I am Yehia.

273
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Yehia Rashed.

274
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,500
Really, you can't remember me, Sherif!

275
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, the beard, right?

276
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,500
Everyone is telling me it made me
look very different.

277
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
How are you "Sheref"?

278
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
I can't believe we are
together again, brother.

279
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,700
Almost 10 years now?

280
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But, you know...

281
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,900
I like this whole new look.

282
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,800
The haircut, and the tattoo.

283
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Are you still into acting or what?

284
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,900
Do you remember college?

285
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,500
The student's union, and politics.

286
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,000
You were a true leader.

287
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
A true leader, indeed.

288
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,000
Do you know where we are, Sherif?

289
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Salt.

290
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Salt?!

291
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,600
Salt...in food...a lot.

292
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,600
Ok.

293
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Ok, "Sheref".

294
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I will tell them to increase
the salt in your food.

295
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,800
Sherif, if you are not comfortable
here we can go somewhere else.

296
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
What happened?

297
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,100
Strange things are mentioned about you
in these documents, I don't believe them.

298
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
Is it true, Sherif?

299
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,400
You are in a bad situation, Sherif!

300
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
If there is anyone who can help
you, it is going to be me.

301
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
There is no such an
illness called "Silence".

302
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
You are a doctor, you know better.

303
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,300
The committee will follow up your case
for 3 weeks, starting tomorrow.

304
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,100
Believe me...you should talk to me first
I would if I were you.

305
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,700
Ok...if you don't want to talk, then write.

306
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Draw.

307
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,000
"40110020019"

308
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,500
Who's phone number is this?

309
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,500
But there is an extra digit.

310
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,700
What is this "4" at the beginning?

311
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
A prefix?

312
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Mohsen!

313
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,500
Mohsen!

314
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,200
Come, help me!

315
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,300
<i>Sherif was found in the same room
from which the victim was thrown.</i>

316
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,000
<i>His veins were severed.</i>

317
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,800
<i>His statements were inconsistent.</i>

318
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,300
<i>I didn't touch my wife...
I killed her...someone else did.</i>

319
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,000
<i>The urine samples found beside
the wall, appeared to be the suspect's.</i>

320
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,000
<i>Which shows that he stayed
there for a while.</i>

321
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,100
<i>A circular cut, 5 cms in diameter
was found at the top of the left thigh.</i>

322
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,500
<i>Caused by stripping the
skin using a sharp tool.</i>

323
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
<i>After inspecting the victim</i>

324
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,400
<i>it was found that she was sexually
assaulted, hours before her death.</i>

325
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,500
<i>Which caused her abortion.</i>

326
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,200
<i>After inspecting the uterus</i>

327
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,500
<i>the fetus was found to be
approximately 8 weeks old.</i>

328
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Hello!

329
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Hello!

330
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Yehia!

331
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,400
Hello!

332
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,000
Hello!

333
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,000
Who is this?!

334
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,400
I am Lobna.

335
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,800
Don't you remember me?

336
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,700
How come?!

337
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
Of course, I do.

338
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Is it a bad time to talk?

339
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,600
No, not at all, I am free
I was just writing some notes.

340
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Not at all.

341
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,300
I got your number from your sister.

342
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,000
She reproached me for an hour because
I haven't spoken since a long time.

343
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,000
How are you Lobna?

344
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,200
You are the best person who can
imagine my feelings right now.

345
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,800
Yehia, I need to meet with you ASAP.

346
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Tomorrow, if possible.

347
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Tomorrow?

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,900
Are't you free?

349
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,000
No, No, I am free, I have nothing at all.

350
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Where?

351
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,300
Hmm...how are you doing today?

352
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,000
Have they increased the
salt in your breakfast?

353
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
You know, Sherif...

354
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,800
Yesterday, while I was searching
some of my old stuff...

355
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,500
I found some of our
old photos together.

356
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Look.

357
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,700
See, how young you were.

358
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,400
By the way.

359
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,100
Lobna called me yesterday
and she is so worried.

360
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,100
I will meet her today, to calm her down.

361
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Do you have anything to tell her?

362
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Sherif!, after a moment you
will meet with the committee.

363
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,600
Let me hear anything from you
before you meet with them.

364
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,900
I didn't murder...

365
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
Amazing!

366
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,500
Amazing!, Sherif!

367
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Then, who did?

368
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,800
The guy sitting right next to you.

369
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,700
Is there someone else
with us in the room?

370
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Seriously?!

371
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,900
Seriously?!, Sherif!

372
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,600
We are doctors, man.

373
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
Try to understand the
gravity of your situation.

374
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Do you think that the committee
will believe a doctor

375
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
faking some cliched
symptoms from the movies.

376
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,000
Are you seeing him now?

377
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,900
Can you describe him?

378
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,700
Why would he kill Basma?

379
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
I want to leave.

380
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Answer my question, Sherif.

381
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,600
I want to leave.

382
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,100
By the way, what was that number you
wrote yesterday, is it a phone number?

383
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,700
I want to leave.

384
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,900
Bank account number?, credit card?

385
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,500
I want to leave.

386
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,500
Do you need money, Sherif?

387
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,300
I want to leave.

388
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:11,800
Calm down.

389
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,500
I want to leave.

390
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,100
You will leave.

391
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,600
I want to leave.

392
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,900
I want you to completely relax.

393
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,500
I want to leave.

394
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
What does this figure remind you of?

395
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,500
I want to leave.

396
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,800
I want to leave.

397
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,400
What about this one?

398
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,100
I want to leave.

399
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,000
this one.

400
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,100
Bahr (Sea).

401
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,400
Sea?!

402
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,500
Not a horse, for instance?

403
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
Bahr (Sea).

404
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,400
What about this?

405
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,300
Sherif you will be executed.

406
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
Do you realize this?

407
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,700
Between you and me
did Basma have an affair?

408
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,100
Can you describe him?

409
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Draw, Sherif!

410
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Anything.

411
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
"40110020019"

412
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,700
What?!

413
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,200
What's the matter, Sherif?!

414
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,600
What can I do now?!
you are disabling me, man!

415
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,000
What?

416
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,600
Where is your report on this case?!

417
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,400
What?, is there a problem?

418
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,000
Leave this case to me, I will read it
and sort it out, before the committee comes.

419
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,200
What are you talking about?

420
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Sherif is staying with me.

421
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,000
And why are you so upset, are you engaged?!

422
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,000
Try to understand.

423
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,000
They ask for a special format for the
report, which you don't know, yet.

424
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,000
Listen to me, he is finally getting
comfortable and starting to talk.

425
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,900
And the committee will be seeing
3 cases apart from him

426
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
what is so special about this case?

427
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,600
Sam...

428
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,100
Here they come.

429
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,900
Welcome back, Yehia!

430
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,200
Thanks, doctor!

431
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,300
I will wait for you in the office
to drink a cup of tea and talk.

432
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,500
I want to hear from you.

433
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,400
What's the news about your case?

434
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,700
What have you seen?

435
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Auditory and visual hallucinations...

436
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,600
A typical Schizophrenic case.

437
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
It's too soon to judge.

438
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,000
Are you comfortable, son?

439
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,000
Look, son...before anything.

440
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,900
We are not prosecutors.

441
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,000
And this is not an investigation.

442
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,400
And your hearing is not impaired
so answer me, so that we can help you.

443
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
What's your name?

444
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,900
Your age?

445
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Ok, then.

446
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
What's your job?

447
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,600
A mule-merchant.

448
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,500
What?!

449
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
This is inappropriate, son.

450
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,000
Show some respect and answer properly.

451
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
You think we are asking
because we don't know!

452
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,900
Why were you fired from the hospital?

453
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
They say you killed
your wife, is it true?

454
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,100
Ok, which type of Schiz.
are you planning to fake?

455
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,500
Paranoia, for example?

456
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Tell us, so that we can help you.

457
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,800
How many of us are in the room?

458
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Six.

459
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
No, we are only 5.

460
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,800
Where did that sixth
person come from?!

461
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,000
And what's the name of this guy
sitting with us while we don't know.

462
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,100
This is all acting work.

463
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,700
Bad acting, actually.

464
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
What doctor?!

465
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,900
At least you should have
studied the case properly.

466
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,700
Sit down.

467
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,500
Sherif!

468
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,200
Sherif!

469
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,500
Sherif!

470
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,600
This is going to be the case of the year!

471
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:25,300
"40110020019"

472
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,100
What do you think, doctor?

473
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,800
He is going to be a big headache, of course.

474
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,000
Someone like him, can very
easily fake symptoms.

475
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,100
But, he is going to make
a mistake, eventually.

476
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,800
I am not saying that a psychiatrist
can never get ill.

477
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,900
But we have seen a lot of tricks.

478
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,200
I want you to inform the nursing
to keep a good eye on him.

479
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,500
And I need to know why he was
fired from the hospital.

480
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,700
And be a bit tough on him, Yehia!

481
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,500
I want you to provoke him.

482
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,000
I want him to get angry.

483
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,200
I want to see what his anger will show us.

484
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Ok?

485
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,100
But, wasn't this guy in class 1994?

486
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,700
That means 5 years before you.

487
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Haven't you ever seen him?

488
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,000
I can't seem to remember him at all.

489
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,300
You know that each batch
is 1,500 students.

490
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,000
Yes, yes, that's true.

491
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Lobna!, how are you?

492
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,300
How are you, Yehia?

493
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,400
How are you?

494
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,400
Say Hi.

495
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Sorry, she is a bit shy
you should have seen her in the club.

496
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,300
God bless her.

497
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,900
Go sit there, Karima!

498
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Have a seat.

499
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
What would you like to drink?

500
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,000
I will take an espresso, and tea for Karima.

501
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,900
Do you want a cheese cake?

502
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,400
One cheese cake.

503
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,400
Another espresso for me.

504
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,800
You have changed a lot, Yehia!

505
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,400
10 years is not a short period.

506
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You have changed, too.

507
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,100
To the better of course.

508
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,200
No, no, not now.

509
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,500
Thanks.

510
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
What's new in your life?

511
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I got married.

512
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,500
And got Haniya.

513
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,400
I work as an HR manager in a bank.

514
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Have you got married?

515
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,200
I was.

516
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,500
You got divorced, for sure.

517
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,400
That's normal, everyone
is divorced nowadays.

518
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,900
Have you got any children?

519
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
I used to have Noor.

520
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,500
My wife and daughter died
in a car crash, 5 years ago.

521
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,000
Hania!, you can go play in the kids area.

522
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,600
Karima!

523
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,300
Take Hania to the kids area.

524
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,600
I am so sorry, Yehia!

525
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,500
I really didn't know.

526
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,800
I called your sister, but...

527
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Don't say anything, Lobna!

528
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,800
That's an old story.

529
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,000
Let us concentrate on the person
that we can still help.

530
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
Tell me what happened.

531
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,200
When I knew that Sherif was in "Al Abasya".

532
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,300
I prayed to God that you would be there.

533
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,100
Fortunately, I am responsible for his case.

534
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,100
Sorry.

535
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,000
Sherif and Basma met in a wedding.

536
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You can say love at first sight.

537
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,600
A few months later, they got married.

538
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,800
Their relationship was going well.

539
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Untill 2 months before the accident.

540
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
I was in France at that time.

541
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,200
I had some work to do.

542
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,400
And when mom called me.

543
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,100
I knew that Basma and
Sherif were having some problems.

544
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
What kind of problems?

545
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,400
She was feeling that Sherif
is treating her differently.

546
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
She suspected that it was
due to her pregnancy.

547
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,800
She called me later, and she was devastated.

548
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,900
She was feeling that he
was having an affair.

549
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,900
And she said that she doesn't know
anything about his life anymore.

550
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,000
While he was at home, he always
locked himself up...for days.

551
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,300
And she told me very weird things.

552
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,500
Like what?

553
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,200
He talks to someone, while he is alone.

554
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,900
As if he sees him.

555
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,100
He stays for hours staring at a corner.

556
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,000
And he said that his left arm is
diseased and must be amputated.

557
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,200
These are normal symptoms
for Schizophrenia.

558
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,100
You mean, two personalities?

559
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
This is how it is portrayed in the movies.

560
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,800
But Schiz. is actually nothing like that.

561
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,900
It's a mental not a psychological disorder.

562
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
It creates delusions.

563
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,200
For example: "The intelligence
is watching me."

564
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,000
"Someone is spying on me."

565
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,000
"My wife wants to poison me."

566
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,900
Go on.

567
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,300
Later, he kicked her out
and changed the door lock.

568
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,200
She stayed with her parents for a week.

569
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,700
He called her, apologized
and begged her to come back.

570
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,300
When she came back, he opened
the door fully naked.

571
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,100
And there was that tattoo that you saw.

572
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,300
After that...

573
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,300
After that he raped her
with extreme violence.

574
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,300
This is what she told me on
the phone while sobbing.

575
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,000
I feel that I am living a nightmare
that won't end.

576
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Lobna!

577
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,800
Please calm down, we are not alone.

578
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,800
I don't know if you knew or not...

579
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
But Basma was pregnant
when she was murdered.

580
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,300
Sherif was dying for a baby.

581
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,400
It's unbelievable that he did
this after 4 years of waiting.

582
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,700
Which one of them had a problem?

583
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,500
Him, Sherif.

584
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,500
Suddenly, Basma became pregnant.

585
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,700
He might have suspected that...

586
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,600
No!

587
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
I know Basma better than myself
don't ever say this.

588
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,500
The only possibility is that
Sherif wasn't himself for a moment.

589
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,900
Or maybe, there is another
woman in his life.

590
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,800
And he did all of that
to get rid of Basma.

591
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,300
I can't believe that this is
how you think of Sherif.

592
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,500
Don't get me wrong, Lobna.

593
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,400
I am putting myself in
the committee's shoes.

594
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,100
The problem is that your
brother is a psychiatrist

595
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,500
which is complicating his
situation a lot.

596
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
I want to see him.

597
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,500
We must get a permission from
the public prosecutor.

598
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,900
Let me see what I can do
and I will tell you.

599
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,300
By the way...

600
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,100
Does Sherif have a bank account?

601
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,700
Yes, I've opened an account for him.

602
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,500
But this is not a bank account number.

603
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,100
Nor a credit card number.

604
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,900
Do you have the key
for his apartment?

605
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,000
Maybe we will find
something that can help us.

606
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Yes, I do, unless Basma's
parents have changed the door lock.

607
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,900
Keep it with you.

608
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,000
Can you come with me?

609
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,500
Come in.

610
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,900
Does your phone have a flashlight?

611
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Yes, here it is.

612
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Hold the phone, Lobna!

613
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,800
"40110020019"

614
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,400
I think that this is the same
number that you've given me.

615
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,700
Hold that.

616
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Sherif never liked History.

617
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,500
It's normal for a schizophrenic.

618
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,000
His brain can take him anywhere.

619
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,800
That's Sherif's phone.

620
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
It looks like the investigators missed it.

621
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
It seems like it was switched off
before the accident.

622
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,400
"Diga, The Tattooist."

623
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,100
I think that this is the place
where he got his tattoo.

624
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,600
Was the islamic museum robbed?

625
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,100
That was 3 months ago.

626
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,300
"The Robbery of the Islamic Museum."

627
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,900
"Al Amal Psychiatric Hospital"

628
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,100
You know about what happened
to Sherif Al Kurdi, for sure.

629
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,600
I needed to gather some information
about the period he worked here.

630
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,500
Sherif has always taken
good care of his health.

631
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,700
But lately...

632
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,800
He became very strange.

633
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,200
We noticed how careless he became.

634
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,000
Personally, I suspected that he might
be taking some kind of drugs.

635
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,900
I tried to talk with him multiple times
but I coudn't understand anything.

636
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,800
Till that time, Sherif was
doing his work properly.

637
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,300
Untill one day, he was sitting with
one of his patients.

638
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
And suddenly the patient started
screaming hysterically.

639
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,300
This was simply because...

640
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,100
Sherif stabbed him with
a pen in his hand.

641
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,700
Yes!

642
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,100
And then?

643
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,500
The hospital board met with him
but couldn't understand his situation.

644
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,000
They decided that Sherif became dangerous.

645
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,700
They had to lay him off.

646
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,100
What's your diagnosis, doctor?

647
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,200
Sherif was my colleague, I don't want
to talk about him badly, but...

648
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,600
When I used to look in his eyes
I was never convinced that he is ill, but...

649
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,500
Let's assume that it's a latent Schiz. case

650
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,700
It wasn't evident, and now it is.

651
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,500
Not to mention his numbers mania.

652
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,900
After Sherif left, we found behind his door

653
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,800
a crazy amount of papers, full of numbers.

654
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Do you still have these papers?

655
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,800
No, we dumped them, of course.

656
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,400
Another thing.

657
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,800
His PhD thesis.

658
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,300
I think that we might still have it.

659
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,700
Here you go.

660
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,000
Thanks!

661
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,200
What was the subject of your thesis again?

662
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,200
Thank you doctor!

663
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,600
Did you ask for a brain scan for Sherif?

664
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,900
Yes, I am suspecting TLE.

665
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,900
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy...

666
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,800
Improbable.

667
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,500
He planned a perfect crime.

668
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,700
By the way, where are you on Facebook?

669
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
No, I don't have an account, not my thing.

670
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,300
Come on!, everone does now.

671
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,000
I have around 90 friends.

672
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,300
And 2 subscriptions.

673
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,200
It means they are following me
to get my news.

674
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,700
You were in 1999 class, right?

675
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,000
Ali Sha'ban was in your class.

676
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,600
I don't remember him.

677
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,600
Ali Sha'ban...

678
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,300
The fat guy, with lots of freckles.

679
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,700
Yes, Ali, I remember him now.

680
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,400
He is bald now, and has got 2 daughters.

681
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,000
I have him on Facebook.

682
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,200
He added some good photos for
your class during Luxor and Aswan trip.

683
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,000
Can you imagine who I found in the photos?

684
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Sherif Al Kurdi.

685
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,600
Strange!

686
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,800
You knew him very well, then!

687
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,500
I knew him...

688
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,500
But he wasn't my friend, nor in my class.

689
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,600
He was the leader of the student's
union during the "Six-Day War".

690
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,600
But you were together in around 7 photos!

691
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
Just saying, because the general
secretariat has very strict rules nowadays

692
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,700
regarding personal relations in "8 west".

693
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,200
You know, we are in a very
sensitive situation...

694
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,800
I told you I didn't know him, Sameh!

695
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,000
Help!, doctor!, there is a
disaster in ward (a).

696
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,000
Get away!

697
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
What happened, Fawzy?

698
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,100
I asked him where he got that
tattoo on his arm.

699
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,500
Just making conversations
instead of doing nothing.

700
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,000
As soon as I put my hand on his arm...

701
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,700
I swear to God, I was just checking
the quality of the tattoo.

702
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,300
he gave me a good punch in the face
I fainted right away.

703
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
I swear to God I won't let that pass.

704
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,400
If you touch him, I will put both of you
in solitary confinment, tied up.

705
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,600
Do you understand?

706
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,700
Dr. Kilani wants to meet with you
after the session.

707
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,700
Ok.

708
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,000
Epilepsy: Negative.

709
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,800
Sit down, Sherif.

710
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,700
Sherif left the room.

711
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,000
Who left the room?!

712
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,100
Sherif.

713
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,600
<i>Superficially, Sherif is not lying.</i>

714
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,500
Hmm...whom I am speaking to right now, then.

715
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,600
A friend.

716
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
You can call me Na'el.

717
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,400
Nael.

718
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,300
Na'el.

719
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,500
Na..I am sorry, I heard it Nael
I am sorry.

720
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,000
How are you Na'el?

721
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,900
Tell me then...

722
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,000
Were you the one always
sitting with us in the room?

723
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,600
Are you still in love with her?

724
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,700
Who's that?

725
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,900
Lobna!

726
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,300
You already know...

727
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,500
I regard her as my sister.

728
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,200
And were you going to
marry your sister?!

729
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
This story ended long time back.

730
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,000
Yes, the lies my friend, the lies.

731
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:00,800
I am not a liar.

732
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,000
This in itself is a lie
all human beings lie.

733
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,000
Why did you beat up Fox?

734
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,500
Have you ever loved your wife?

735
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,200
What?, did I make you nervous?

736
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,000
You spoke with Sameh, correct?

737
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,200
Have you ever loved your wife?

738
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,000
For sure.

739
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,100
But let us stay on subject.

740
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,200
Tell me about the day Basma died.

741
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,500
Why not?, I will tell you.

742
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,200
But according to the
rules of the game.

743
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,100
A question for a question.

744
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,500
Ok.

745
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,900
Who killed Basma?

746
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,700
No, you already know the answer
to this question.

747
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,800
But you are in denial.

748
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,500
You are trying to find an
excuse for your friend.

749
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,600
If my friend did indeed murder...

750
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,300
I will never hesitate to
mention that in my report.

751
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,800
Then what are you waiting for, Boss.

752
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,200
It's as clear as the sun.

753
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,100
Or is it because of Lobna?

754
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,900
Lobna has nothing to do with this.

755
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,800
What do you mean Lobna
has nothing to do with this?

756
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,800
How come?

757
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,600
Can you deny that you have
never forgotten her?

758
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,800
Can you deny that she screwed
up your marriage and your life.

759
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Can you deny that you want
to prove yourself before her.

760
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,000
To show that you deserved her, and whatnot.

761
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,800
Why not say that I want to help her?

762
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,100
That's a good one, too.

763
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,800
But Lobna is still a beauty, isn't she?

764
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,000
I bet your eyes never missed
her chest while sitting down.

765
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,400
Or her legs, getting inside the car.

766
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,100
That's a normal part of attraction
towards a female.

767
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,900
Not me.

768
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,600
Not with Lobna, Sherif.

769
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,400
When I wanted your sister
I looked at her respectfully.

770
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,500
Respectfully!

771
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,300
Don't play a fool, Yehia.

772
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,000
No one looks at a
woman he wants respectfully.

773
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,200
If you hadn't inspected her top to bottom...

774
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,000
You wouldn't have liked her.

775
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Who murdered Basma?

776
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,600
"Sometime Love Kills."
(A famous Arabic quote)

777
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,500
By the way, tell me...

778
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,000
How did your wife and daughter die?

779
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,400
Whoever told you the story
must have mentioned this part.

780
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,800
What's wrong, Yehia?, calm down.

781
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,900
A psychiatrist should not
be provoked so easily.

782
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,900
We are doctors!, my friend.

783
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,400
The details, Yehia.

784
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,800
I am obsessed with details.

785
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,300
The car went sideways.

786
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,100
I made it, and they didn't.

787
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,500
Fate.

788
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,900
Yes, Fate.

789
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,100
Fate going by the speed of 160 kms/hr!

790
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Alcohol can achieve miracles!, my friend!

791
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,900
It can solve unsolvable problems.

792
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,900
But, between you and me...

793
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,900
You can't deny that
some part inside you

794
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,000
was relieved, correct?

795
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,400
Who killed Basma, Sherif?

796
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Ask Sherif.

797
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,600
Sherif!

798
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:13,800
Sherif!

799
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,400
Mohsen!

800
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,000
Mohsen!

801
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,000
If somebody told me 3 months ago

802
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,100
that I will be in the insane
hospital at 11:00 PM

803
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,000
I wouldn't have believed him.

804
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,100
Who said that they are the insane ones?

805
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,500
Maybe it's us, but we can't notice.

806
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,600
You haven't changed, Yehia.

807
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,500
You just think so.

808
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,100
I have changed, a lot.

809
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,800
To the worse.

810
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,300
Coffee?

811
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,600
Should I grab a soft
drink from inside?

812
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,600
Should I get you
the patients' juice?

813
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,500
No, thank you.

814
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,100
I am full.

815
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,500
Have you checked Sherif's phone?

816
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,600
I did.

817
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,000
And transferred the photos to my phone.

818
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,000
Are these supposed to be an evidence
for or against his innocence?

819
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't know, Lobna.

820
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
There are lots of possibilities
more than you can imagine.

821
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,700
Is it possible that
there is a personality

822
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,000
that loves Basma
and the other hates her?

823
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,300
See, Lobna.

824
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,300
We can't deny that Sherif killed
Basma after he rapped her.

825
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,300
The problem is that the
schizophrenic is usually conscious.

826
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
That look in the photos...

827
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,400
As if he is showing off

828
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,100
feeling victorious.

829
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,900
What is the best ending possible?

830
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,100
Finding an evidence for a mental
not a psychological disorder

831
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,600
that will deny his responsibility
for the murder.

832
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,000
To be shown ill is better than
to be executed, Lobna.

833
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,500
And the worst?

834
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,800
That Sherif is keeping a secret
and not planning to tell anyone.

835
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,900
We missed something...

836
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,300
How did Sherif know that I am
still living in the same apartment

837
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
since we were students?

838
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,500
What's the point of that question?

839
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,200
A couple of days ago
I recieved a mail at home.

840
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,800
With the same drawing
that we found on Sherif's phone.

841
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,800
He must be the one who sent it.

842
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:54,800
The museum...

843
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,100
And this shirt he was wearing.

844
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,000
The photo taken in front of the mirror
at the time of the accident.

845
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,400
Are you going to hand
the photos to the police?

846
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,500
Lobna!

847
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,000
I am not seeking revenge because
of and old and dead story.

848
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,700
I didn't say so...I didn't say so.

849
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,100
You said it with your eyes.

850
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,500
I know you better than anyone.

851
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,100
Come with me.

852
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,500
Your sister is outside
she wants to talk to you.

853
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,000
Answer her.

854
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,800
Hello!

855
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,600
Sherif!

856
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,000
This is Lobna, Sherif.

857
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:07,800
Hello!

858
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,600
Sherif!

859
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,600
Sherif!, Answer me, Sherif!

860
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,400
I am Lobna, Sherif!

861
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,000
Do you know who is sending her regards?

862
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,600
Hania.

863
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,700
Always asking: "Where is uncle?"

864
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,200
And mom also wants to
talk to you very much.

865
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,500
Sherif!

866
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,400
Sherif!, answer me.

867
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,500
Answer me, Sherif!

868
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,100
Mohsen!

869
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,300
Come.

870
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,500
Have you seen what your
animal friend has done?

871
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,400
First, he is not my friend.

872
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,500
Second, go take a bath, Sameh!

873
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,900
Urine and water...

874
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,100
Not a good mix.

875
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,400
No worries, it will dry up now.

876
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,300
What brought you here
in the first place?

877
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,800
You want to know what brought me, doctor?

878
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,200
Fine.

879
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,700
What brought me is that
we are being fooled here.

880
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
He is faking it.

881
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,000
It's very clear.

882
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,800
But he can't trick me.

883
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,200
He can trick anyone, but Sameh Zidan!

884
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,700
In that very same place
stood a hundred before him.

885
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,000
With better acting skills.

886
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,700
And I could expose them
from the first hearing.

887
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,300
I never missed, not a single time.

888
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,400
Do you hear me?

889
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
Keep it brief, Sameh.

890
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,000
You came back only
for him, of course.

891
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,800
Watch your words!

892
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,500
You know that Dr. Safaa'
chose "8 west" by coincidence.

893
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,500
Coincidence!

894
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,700
And this colleague of yours who is not
your friend, and you got his case.

895
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,400
Coincidence?

896
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,300
And this car parked outside
with the chick calling him on the phone.

897
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,600
Also a coincidence?!

898
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,500
No, my friend, I am not a moron.

899
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,200
I am Sameh Zidan!

900
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,000
And the secretariat of health will not
let it pass when they are informed

901
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,700
that there is a personal relation
between you and the suspect.

902
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,000
Aren't you going to stop
being malevolent?

903
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,600
Malevolent?!

904
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,000
You smuggled a cell phone
to a suspect in "8 west"

905
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,200
and I am being malevolent?!

906
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,100
Wake up, doctor!

907
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,700
You won't forget that she was my wife.

908
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,000
You can't imagine that she
loved me, not you.

909
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,700
Your brain can't comprehend
that you were rejected.

910
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,000
I wasn't rejected.

911
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,400
As much as I loved her
and were preparing for marriage.

912
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,000
I pitied her that she
chose someone like you.

913
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,600
That's life.

914
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,700
I struggled everyday in a train
from Cairo to Faiyum and back.

915
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,100
Studying hard to become
the top of my class.

916
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,200
And at the end...

917
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,600
She will fall in love with
a drunk loser like you.

918
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,400
I still don't understand how
she fell for someone like you.

919
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Then, ask her.

920
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,600
No...

921
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,700
I will ask your daughter.

922
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,500
I forgot something.

923
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
Why did you hit him?

924
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,700
Sameh was in love with my wife
before I married her.

925
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,500
She was our colleague in the hospital.

926
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,400
He proposed, and she rejected.

927
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,600
He has been holding a grudge
against me since then.

928
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,100
That's why you punched him.

929
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,600
I punched him because he
gloated over my daughter's death.

930
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,600
But it's not your fault.

931
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,500
Were you...

932
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,500
Were you drunk at the
time of the accident?

933
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,100
It was Noor's birthday.

934
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,600
The 24th of August.

935
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
I was...

936
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,000
We were used to travel on that day.

937
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,400
I remember that we saw
a fish shaped cloud.

938
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,600
And Noor noticed it.

939
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,000
She was very smart.

940
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,800
I bought her a
fish shaped ballon.

941
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,700
I could never say no to her.

942
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,500
Me and Nermin were fighting.

943
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,200
Although I vowed that I won't
fight with her on that day.

944
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
She provoked me.

945
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,500
I drank half a bottle of whiskey.

946
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,700
I didn't notice that we were
flying at 160 kms/hr.

947
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,500
We went sideways.

948
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,500
You know...

949
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,000
Time freezes at the moment of death.

950
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,000
I can see it, as if it is
being repeated everday.

951
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,900
To the smallest detail.

952
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,400
The bottle flying out of my grip...

953
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,200
Nermin's scared face...

954
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,600
and Noor's in the mirror.

955
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,700
And me being helpless
not able to save her.

956
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,900
When we landed on the tarmac...

957
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,900
And Noor swimming in her blood.

958
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
You know...

959
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,100
This was my first death.

960
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,500
Why haven't you loved her?

961
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,700
I loved her.

962
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,300
As a wife.

963
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,100
And I was going to spend the rest of
my life with her, for the sake of Noor.

964
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,100
Although there was no
middle ground between us.

965
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,400
And now...

966
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,100
I am supposed to cope, and confront the fact
that I was the cause of their death.

967
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,500
Why did you let yourself reach that point?

968
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,200
Why?

969
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,500
That's a very difficult question.

970
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,900
Why did I lose you in the first place?

971
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,200
Why did Sherif reject me, when I proposed?

972
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,300
Despite being more than a brother to me.

973
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,900
We spent all of our time together.

974
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,900
He was a role model to me.

975
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,000
But we had pleasure time together.

976
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,900
We drank and smoked together.

977
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,300
And then, I fell in love with you.

978
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,100
But he was right.

979
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,400
If I were him, I wouldn't let
my sister marry someone like me.

980
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,700
Indeed, he was right.

981
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,100
That's not what I meant.

982
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,400
I mean, he never believed
that I could change for you.

983
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:09,900
Lobna!

984
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,100
Being with Nermin, I couldn't
forget you for a single day.

985
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,600
Neither could I.

986
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,600
I spent a very long time

987
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,800
till I could comprehend that
you won't be in my life anymore.

988
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,000
I attempted suicide once
cutting my veins.

989
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,800
They barely saved me.

990
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,400
You are not the only
one who've suffered.

991
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,000
Can you imagine...

992
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,800
I am still in love with you.

993
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,100
Let's go.

994
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,200
You should be going, now.

995
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,100
I got you in trouble, right?

996
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,800
I was going to beat up Sameh
sooner or later.

997
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Let's go?

998
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Hello!

999
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,400
Hello!

1000
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,300
Yes!

1001
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,300
Who is this?

1002
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,500
What's that?, have you forgotten my voice?

1003
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,800
I am not Sherif, I am
speaking from his phone.

1004
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:34,700
I...

1005
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,500
I know that you are not Sherif.

1006
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,000
Seriously, I am upset.

1007
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,500
Who's talking to me?

1008
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,000
But, have you seen how beautiful Basma were

1009
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,500
in the photos with your friend?

1010
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,800
Indeed, can not be forgotten.

1011
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,700
Hello!

1012
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,400
I don't know what you are talking about.

1013
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,500
Again...

1014
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,400
That's another lie.

1015
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,100
Hello!

1016
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,200
I am not lying.

1017
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Haven't I just told you
that every human being lies?

1018
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,800
Sherif!

1019
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
Where are you talking from?!

1020
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:13,600
What happened, doctor?

1021
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,500
Where is Mohsen, Ashraf?

1022
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,100
What happened?!

1023
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,300
Who smuggled the phone to
Sherif Al Kurdi?

1024
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,400
What phone?!

1025
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,000
Who gave him the phone, Ashraf?

1026
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,500
Didn't happen, I swear, doctor!

1027
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,200
Sherif!

1028
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,000
Sherif!

1029
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,800
Finish, I need you.

1030
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,800
Have you met Lobna?

1031
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,200
Yes, I did.

1032
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
And you can't imagine how
she is feeling right now.

1033
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,100
Do you know why?

1034
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,200
Her husband is 12 years older than her.

1035
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,000
An old bone...

1036
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,000
Different ideologies...

1037
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,200
And he is weak, not like you.

1038
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,500
Can't handle that machine
that he has got.

1039
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,900
By the way, Yehia.

1040
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,500
How do you think Lobna
would live, if he died?

1041
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
I don't know.

1042
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,400
And I wouldn't wish her so.

1043
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:11,900
Believe me...

1044
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,600
Her life would be better.

1045
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,700
Listen to me...

1046
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,400
Enough of your imaginations.

1047
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,000
Imagination is not a fault.

1048
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,000
What is, is to hide it inside of you

1049
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,700
and only let it out
when you're drunk.

1050
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,500
That's not very courageous.

1051
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,800
You know, yehia...

1052
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,200
If time goes back...

1053
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,000
I would still not let you marry her.

1054
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,600
You wouldn't have longed for her
like you do now.

1055
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,100
She would have been like your wife, Nermin.

1056
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,400
Boring...

1057
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,100
And silly.

1058
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,000
I told you already, this is a dead story.

1059
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:55,700
Ok, let's have the same conversation
but after drinking a couple of glasses.

1060
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,300
You still like whiskey, right?

1061
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,100
Ok, finish, I need to talk with you.

1062
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,500
Sherif!

1063
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,800
Sherif!

1064
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,200
Sherif!

1065
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,200
Ashraf!

1066
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,700
Ashraf!

1067
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,800
Increase to 300!...300!

1068
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Yehia!

1069
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,300
The shirt!

1070
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,400
Wait outside please!

1071
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,600
Please, wait outside!

1072
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,400
Hi!

1073
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,500
Come in!

1074
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,500
Do you have an appointment
or first time?

1075
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,400
Are you the owner of this place?

1076
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,300
Mrs. Diga is the owner
but she is busy in a session right now.

1077
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,500
Diga!, she is foreign, right?

1078
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,000
No, Diga, Khadiga, nickname.

1079
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,600
Hmm, Diga, Khadiga.

1080
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,100
I will wait for her.

1081
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,100
Come inside.

1082
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,600
Don't forget the cream, 3 times a day.

1083
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,900
Bird of prey?

1084
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,400
A feathery hawk?

1085
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,500
A bull with big horns?

1086
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,600
Horns?!

1087
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,000
Or a scorpion?

1088
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,300
No, I think that there
is a misunderstanding here.

1089
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,200
I am...

1090
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:56,900
Ok.

1091
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,500
Come.

1092
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,400
Roselle, from Yemen, you will like it.

1093
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,400
Is it your first tattoo?

1094
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,700
There is a misunderstanding
if you will let me explain.

1095
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,200
Very good drink.

1096
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,500
I am here to ask
about a job you did before.

1097
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,700
This one.

1098
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,300
Molly!

1099
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,500
Molly!

1100
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,500
Did he send you?

1101
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,800
There is a misunderstanding.

1102
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,400
I sweared I won't let him leave
if he ever approaches here again.

1103
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,700
I am a doctor.

1104
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,800
I am really sorry.

1105
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,500
Ok, Molly!

1106
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,500
Haven't you ever kicked
something before?

1107
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,200
What am I going to do
with your apology?

1108
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,300
Again, I am really sorry.

1109
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,100
But this guy in the photo
gave me a double fracture.

1110
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,500
Are you the one who
gave him this tattoo?

1111
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,900
No, I am the one who tried
to remove it, but failed.

1112
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,700
Tell me what happened.

1113
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,800
This guy is completely insane.

1114
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,600
He was mumbling unintelligible words.

1115
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,400
What I understood from him, is that he
wanted to remove his tattoo immediately.

1116
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,200
And it could only be removed using Laser.

1117
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,600
But this is very painful.

1118
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,900
As soon as I turned on the machine

1119
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,200
he looked at me, laughing, and broke my arm.

1120
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:29,000
And this explains what I did to you.

1121
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,500
Does this drawing have any meaning to it?

1122
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,100
I have never seen anything like it before.

1123
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,700
The style is eastern.

1124
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,400
But I am sure that it
was done outside Egypt.

1125
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,100
We don't have this
kind of machines here.

1126
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,800
What about this one on her thigh?

1127
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,000
No, this looks like henna
the cheap stuff found at the beaches.

1128
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,600
Why weren't you answering your phone?
I was worried.

1129
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,000
Nothing...

1130
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,000
I went back to work.

1131
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,600
Really, you went back
to the crazy people?

1132
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,300
Do you need money?

1133
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,100
No, Maya!, I don't need money.

1134
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,900
But I was bored.

1135
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,900
Time for some change.

1136
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,400
Change?

1137
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,900
What about a trip to "Dahab".

1138
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,000
Spend the weekend there...please!

1139
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,100
Maya!, I have a lot of troubles
tone it down, please.

1140
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:32,000
Look, I brought a new stuff with me that
can make you run up the pyramids.

1141
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,000
And there is a surprise also...please!

1142
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,200
What do you think?

1143
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,300
"Absinth!"

1144
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,200
I sweared I won't drink it without you.

1145
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Good girl.

1146
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,400
Long time...

1147
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,000
Ok.

1148
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,300
Yehia!, who's this Lobna?

1149
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,200
That's an old story
that ended before it even began.

1150
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,900
But, your way of talking
about her says otherwise.

1151
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Can't you see how you look?

1152
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,100
Maya!, you are drunk, darling!

1153
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,400
I am not, and if you don't
tell me, I will leave.

1154
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,000
Sit down!, you have no where else to go.

1155
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,500
Lobna is an old love story.

1156
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,500
I haven't seen her for 10 years
and each has gone his separate way.

1157
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,600
Do you still love her?

1158
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,400
The lighter, darling!

1159
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,800
Do you realize that you've never
told me that you love me.

1160
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,600
Because I don't.

1161
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,900
Maya, we are just friends.

1162
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,800
And we've agreed on that
from the first day.

1163
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,000
Sometimes we need each
other for a benefit.

1164
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,400
But this has nothing to
do with friendship.

1165
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,200
You have a strange mind, indeed!

1166
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,700
I told you that I love you the
next day after we slept together.

1167
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,300
Even if I got married
I will probably come and visit you.

1168
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,300
Both of you will come
visit me, or what?

1169
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,300
Stop it...

1170
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,800
Sometimes I wonder
why I never get bored of you.

1171
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:46,900
You are really strange.

1172
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,400
What do you mean strange?
with three legs?

1173
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,400
Nice one...where did you get that from?

1174
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,500
You have a dirty mind!

1175
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,000
Am I the one with the dirty mind?!

1176
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,000
Very...

1177
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,000
Let's go inside.

1178
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,500
Maya!, don't you ever feel
sympathy towards me?

1179
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,000
Don't spoil the mood, and relax.

1180
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,700
I have something else for you
forget all of this.

1181
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,500
What's this?

1182
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,000
This is the blue elephant, darling.

1183
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,600
You won't believe this stuff.

1184
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,600
This is it's first time in Egypt.

1185
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,700
LSD?

1186
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,900
You know that synthetic
drugs aren't my type.

1187
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,400
LSD is child's play.

1188
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,100
This is called...D.M.T.

1189
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,500
A substance discovered to be produced
in the brain of a dying person.

1190
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,500
Which helps him relax while
anticipating his next life.

1191
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,500
A one hour journey.

1192
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,900
Where you will see what you've
never imagined possible.

1193
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,300
You know that I don't try unknown drugs.

1194
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,600
Aren't you saying that your
life is broken down?

1195
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,300
What do you have to lose?

1196
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,800
It changed the lives of
those who tried it.

1197
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,000
Go on.

1198
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:57,900
Run away.

1199
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,100
Maya!

1200
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,000
Maya!

1201
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,900
Maya!

1202
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,100
Maya!

1203
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,300
Maya!

1204
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:26,700
Maya!

1205
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,600
Maya!

1206
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,700
Maya!

1207
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:05,900
Dog!

1208
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,800
Dog!

1209
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,400
What happened?

1210
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,000
What's wrong?

1211
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:16,700
What's wrong, Maya?!

1212
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,600
Dog!

1213
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,500
Calm down.

1214
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,500
Dog!, Dog!, Dog!

1215
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,300
Maya!

1216
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,900
Dog!, Dog!, Dog!

1217
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,700
Yehia!

1218
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,500
Sorry!

1219
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:56,900
Are you ok?

1220
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,000
Listen...

1221
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,900
Wait for me upstairs, I will finish
this round and come up to you.

1222
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,800
Shakir is still upset
but I will sort it out.

1223
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,200
Hello!

1224
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,200
Yehia!

1225
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,500
Yehia!

1226
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,900
Where are you?

1227
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,200
Have you heard what happened?

1228
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,600
Maya!

1229
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,100
Maya is dead, Yehia!

1230
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,500
She was hit by a car in the Ma'adi area.

1231
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,300
Was she...

1232
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,700
Was she with you?

1233
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,000
Hello!

1234
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,500
Yes darling, my prayers with you.

1235
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:55,500
Yehia, can you please take
care of your blood sugar issue.

1236
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,800
Who gave you the phone?

1237
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,000
Who killed Maya, Yehia?

1238
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,300
How strange the human being is!

1239
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,300
How could you let her
go out in that condition?!

1240
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,500
I didn't touch her.

1241
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
The photos on your phone say otherwise.

1242
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,000
What photos, Sherif?!

1243
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,200
Sherif again?!

1244
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,300
Always confusing me with you friend.

1245
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,800
I will seriously become upset.

1246
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,800
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL YOU?!

1247
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,900
Calm down, Yehia!, calm down.

1248
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,500
Tell me...

1249
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,900
Maya or Lobna?

1250
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,700
Who is more delicious?

1251
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,500
If you are a real man
say this in front of my face.

1252
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,600
Now I think that you will
devote yourself to Lobna.

1253
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,400
Like how you killed Basma to devote
yourself to another woman?!

1254
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,000
Correct?

1255
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:00,000
Unfortunately, I am always
the scapegoat to any whim.

1256
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,700
Where is the phone that you have got?

1257
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,300
Where is the phone that you have, Sherif?

1258
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,200
What?...What?

1259
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,100
What?, Yehia, stop it.

1260
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,700
Where is the phone?

1261
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,500
You wrongfully accused me, my friend.

1262
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,100
By the way...

1263
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,300
I need to have a session with you, urgently.

1264
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,600
A session?!

1265
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,600
I am really worried about this
whole phone hallucinations thing.

1266
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,200
And...

1267
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,200
I haven't been excercising
psychiatry for a while now

1268
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,200
I am worried that I might
forget the profession.

1269
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,000
I don't have time for your games.

1270
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,300
Who gave you the phone?

1271
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,000
Again?!, the phone thing, Yehia?!

1272
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,000
Again?!

1273
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,300
Ok, look...

1274
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,900
Let's make a deal.

1275
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,500
If you let me have a session with you

1276
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,800
and make sure you are ok

1277
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,100
I will answer all of your questions.

1278
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:37,900
All of them.

1279
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,900
Do we have an agreement?

1280
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,300
I need a paper and a pen.

1281
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,400
Just a paper and a pen!

1282
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,000
Thanks!

1283
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,000
Have a seat, and get comfortable.

1284
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,100
Look, Yehia!

1285
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,800
I think that your chance has come.

1286
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,700
A chance to get your life back.

1287
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,200
To get the dust off of you.

1288
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,100
I won't lie to you...

1289
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,600
You've started the way towards insanity.

1290
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,600
Just a couple of months...

1291
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,000
and you will come join
your patients here.

1292
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,500
Enough messing around.

1293
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,300
Just a single question
and I need the answer, now.

1294
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,700
Who is spying on me?

1295
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,100
Everyone is spying on himself
my friend.

1296
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:38,900
If you scratch yourself
you will find me inside.

1297
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,200
Aren't you afraid?

1298
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,100
Aren't you afraid that you would die
with Sherif, if he got executed?

1299
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:50,100
Be professional, doctor.

1300
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:53,300
Let Sherif meet his destiny

1301
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:56,000
that was intended for him
before he was even born.

1302
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,700
But, isn't it a bit strange?

1303
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,700
His destiny was intended for
him before he was even born.

1304
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,800
What a poor guy, Sherif!

1305
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:12,600
You know...

1306
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:13,200
Hmm.

1307
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,200
If anyone is going to die...

1308
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,100
It's going to be you.

1309
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,700
Yehia!

1310
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,500
Al Ma'moon's shirt!

1311
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,100
What Ma'moon?!

1312
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,400
Tell me!, what is the story
of this shirt, Sherif?

1313
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,400
Speak!

1314
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,200
In the apartment.

1315
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,400
Nursing!

1316
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:12,600
Peace be upon you, hajji!

1317
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,500
Peace be upon you!

1318
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
How do you do, hajji?

1319
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,500
This apartment is for sale, correct?

1320
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,800
Yes, son, come in.

1321
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:19,800
Make tea, Om Shaima'.

1322
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:20,900
No need, thanks.

1323
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Just excuse me to take a
look at the apartment.

1324
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:26,400
Have a seat, hajji.

1325
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,300
Not possible, I will show you around.

1326
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,500
I don't want to bother you.

1327
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,000
No, not at all, come on in.

1328
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:36,200
Is the furniture also for
sale or...not possible?

1329
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,300
Why not, It's less than 1
year old, still new.

1330
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,900
It's all beechwood, imported.

1331
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,000
Regarding the clothes, hajji...

1332
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,800
I take part in a charity

1333
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,600
and you know...the orphants.

1334
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:52,000
Sure, it's all for God's sake.

1335
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,100
But let's discuss first about the apartment

1336
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,200
then we'll check the clothes.

1337
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:56,100
That's right.

1338
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,300
Sorry, Hajji, can I ask
for a glass of water

1339
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,300
I am dying of thirst.

1340
01:37:59,400 --> 01:37:59,900
Of course.

1341
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,600
Thanks a lot.

1342
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,800
I doubt that this shelf is
beechwood, hajji.

1343
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,600
It's all beechwood, son!

1344
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:17,500
Even the shelf?!

1345
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:18,800
Yes, even the shelf!

1346
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,500
Strange!

1347
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:23,000
Thanks.

1348
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,200
Welcome.

1349
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:25,600
The bathroom, please.

1350
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,300
Sherif will kill himself, next time.

1351
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,300
I can't believe that after all of this...

1352
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,700
he can get executed.

1353
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:57,600
Hello!

1354
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,300
No, I am not at home.

1355
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,800
Ok, we will talk later.

1356
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,800
This is Khaled.

1357
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,300
You know...Khaled doesn't
know that I smoke.

1358
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,700
He is a kind person.

1359
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:28,200
But, he hasn't been the same
since what happened to Sherif.

1360
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,400
I feel that...

1361
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,900
he is ashamed of me...I don't know.

1362
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,500
How did you get married?

1363
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,100
He was my client at the bank.

1364
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
We weren't getting along
for the first year of marriage.

1365
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,300
I wanted to get a divorce.

1366
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,000
But...

1367
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,300
No, I won't tell you.

1368
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,500
Why not?

1369
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,700
Because I am not supposed
to be telling you this.

1370
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,800
I am Yehia, Lobna!

1371
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,400
That's the problem.

1372
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,400
I have to go now.

1373
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:16,400
Haniya is alone with Karima.

1374
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,600
Take care of yourself.

1375
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,700
Close the door!

1376
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,100
D.M.T!

1377
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,200
He knows that you are coming back.

1378
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,400
It is destined for us
to meet by the tree.

1379
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,050
Who are you talking about, uncle Sayed?

1380
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,700
The landlord.

1381
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:46,500
The one who knows the secret.

1382
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,200
Al Ma'moon.

1383
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,800
Yehia!

1384
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:20,800
Yehia!

1385
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,900
Come closer.

1386
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,800
My skin is tearing.

1387
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,500
I can't endure it.

1388
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,500
What is the need for puncturing?

1389
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,400
Couldn't we just make it a henna?

1390
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,800
You have to endure in
order to get the reward.

1391
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,700
Be patient, daughter.

1392
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,900
Have you seen Bahr?

1393
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,500
His name was Bahr.

1394
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,200
Who is that?

1395
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,800
He was the biggest mule in the region.

1396
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:28,900
His mother was a pure arabian horse.

1397
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,200
His color under sunlight...

1398
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,500
Had a blue tint, same like the sea.

1399
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,900
So I called him Bahr (sea).

1400
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,400
What mule?

1401
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,500
How do you see...

1402
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,300
Have you found the shirt?

1403
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,100
The shirt is with me.

1404
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,800
This shirt has to be returned.

1405
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,900
Burn it, Yehia!

1406
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,700
Listen to me.

1407
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,600
I have to understand.

1408
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,300
How did it reach your apartment.

1409
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,500
I stole it, Yehia!

1410
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:11,800
I stole it.

1411
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:14,300
Bring the shirt...

1412
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,800
And burn it.

1413
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,600
I have to understand, first.

1414
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,600
Ok.

1415
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,200
Ok.

1416
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,500
But according to the rules of our game

1417
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,300
the question is mine.

1418
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,400
And the question is...

1419
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,400
Yehia, answer me honestly...

1420
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,200
How many times did you close your eyes

1421
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,300
and imagine Lobna in your arms?

1422
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,500
But without any lies or tales.

1423
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,800
Enough about Lobna, already.

1424
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,400
Don't you ever get sick of this?

1425
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:50,300
Don't you ever get sick, man?!

1426
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,100
I am the one who should
ask you this question.

1427
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:53,900
Yehia!

1428
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:57,300
I am surprised that you still
haven't committed suicide till now.

1429
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,500
What?!

1430
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,200
Are you going to spend your
whole life that way?!

1431
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:03,400
Watching her behind the display window?

1432
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:06,100
Are you going to leave
her to spend her whole life

1433
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:07,500
with a man she doesn't love?

1434
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,900
A woman loves a man who seizes her.

1435
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:14,700
Hmm...

1436
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,000
And rapes her, then kills her.

1437
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,300
Correct?

1438
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:24,000
There exists pleasure in resistance.

1439
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,300
Take it from me.

1440
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,600
How do you get into my dreams?

1441
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,000
No, I don't get into your dreams.

1442
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,600
You are the one who
steps into my world.

1443
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,300
The shirt, man.

1444
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,400
Bring the shirt...

1445
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Burn it...

1446
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,700
Then you will find answers
to all of your questions.

1447
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,900
Go ahead, my hero!

1448
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:47,800
Go ahead.

1449
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,700
I won't burn it, Sherif.

1450
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:53,400
I won't burn it...

1451
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,500
Till I understand everything.

1452
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,100
Mohsen!

1453
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,500
No, Yehia!

1454
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,400
In that case, you would
be harming yourself.

1455
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,500
If you don't burn the shirt...

1456
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,200
You will wish you were dead...

1457
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,100
And you won't get it
in an honorable way.

1458
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:42,900
Are you ok?

1459
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,100
I am here to congratulate you
for your great acting.

1460
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,300
Complete insanity, indeed.

1461
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:16,400
You are a doctor, respect yourself.

1462
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,600
Tell me the truth, Sherif
I might be able to help you.

1463
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,000
We are colleagues in the end.

1464
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,800
Your friend told you not to
talk with me, right?

1465
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,000
Your drunk, loser friend.

1466
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,100
I killed her.

1467
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,500
Good!

1468
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,600
Now we are starting to
understand each other.

1469
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,800
She betrayed me.

1470
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:39,300
So, I killed her.

1471
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,200
Any man in my place...

1472
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,800
Would do the same.

1473
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:47,900
If time goes back...

1474
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,500
I would still kill her.

1475
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,100
Yehia on the other hand...

1476
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:53,800
Does he know any of this?

1477
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,300
Yehia is the one who agreed
with me to perform this act.

1478
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,700
So that you can end up in a hospital
instead of being executed, right?

1479
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,400
What will he get in return?

1480
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,000
That's the problem...

1481
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,400
Yehia wants to marry my sister.

1482
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,700
He's been mad about her
for a very long time.

1483
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:12,300
An old story...

1484
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:14,700
which he never forgot.

1485
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,200
But my sister is married.

1486
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,300
I knew something was wrong.

1487
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,100
But he doesn't know.

1488
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:24,000
What do you mean "doesn't know"?

1489
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,200
Yehia is schizophrenic.

1490
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,500
Since his family's death.

1491
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,700
Schizophrenic?!

1492
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,300
He doesn't believe that he
agreed with me on anything.

1493
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,200
He speaks to himself.

1494
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,100
And claims that I am the
one speaking to him.

1495
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,700
He speaks to himself
from his own phone.

1496
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,700
And answers from my phone.

1497
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,600
Imagining...

1498
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,000
that someone else is speaking with him.

1499
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,300
Yehia can't imagine...

1500
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:00,400
that he is the one who chose
my ward and my case.

1501
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,400
He is even denying that he knew
about my case from the news.

1502
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:07,700
Before he came back.

1503
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,200
And why are you telling on him?

1504
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,200
Because he threatened to kill me

1505
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,400
when I told him that he
can't marry my sister.

1506
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,500
Yehia is insane!

1507
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,000
And he has been holding a grudge

1508
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,000
since the time I refused
to let him marry my sister.

1509
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,600
Sameh!

1510
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,600
Please try to help him.

1511
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,000
I am dead, either way.

1512
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,100
Oh my God...

1513
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,900
Yehia is a colleague
regardless of anything.

1514
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:55,000
And he was always one step ahead of me.

1515
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,500
I wouldn't wish him illness, for sure.

1516
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,600
Yes, for sure.

1517
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,600
Don't worry.

1518
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,700
Don't worry, Sherif
and try to stay calm, ok?

1519
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,700
Don't talk with him about anything.

1520
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,000
And I will handle it.

1521
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,000
Doctor Yehia!

1522
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,800
You are late, doctor.

1523
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:10,700
Sorry, I had an appointment, uncle Sayed.

1524
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,400
Your appointment was by the tree.

1525
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,200
What tree, uncle Sayed?

1526
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,900
Om Al Sho'oor tree.

1527
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,600
The outside tree?

1528
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,800
Do trees grow inside, doctor?!

1529
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,200
What do you think about
Sherif's confessions?

1530
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,800
I think that Sameh is lying.

1531
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,900
A complaint from a hateful person.

1532
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,000
But you actually
knew Sherif before?

1533
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:06,200
Why did you deny it
when I asked you?

1534
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,600
I didn't remember him
he wasn't in my class, doctor.

1535
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,500
He is 5 years older than me.

1536
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,700
He looks totally different now.

1537
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,200
Ok.

1538
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,600
And what about his sister?

1539
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,200
Would you really believe this nonsense?

1540
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:25,500
Would I threaten someone
to marry his married sister?!

1541
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,400
I never said that she is married?!

1542
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,000
I assumed that she is married.

1543
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,700
It's nothing but lies.

1544
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,800
And as I told you before

1545
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:41,200
Sherif Al Kurdi is a schizophrenic case.

1546
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,600
Sameh's evaluation shows
that he spoke with him.

1547
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:47,600
And that he is normal
not schizophrenic.

1548
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,900
Sameh only had one sitting with him

1549
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,400
and he mixes work with personal life

1550
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:55,900
and above all, he loathes me.

1551
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:59,400
Ok, keep Sameh out of this
and answer me.

1552
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:02,200
Do you have any relationship
with Sherif's sister?

1553
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:05,800
As I told you, doctor...

1554
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,300
I don't know her.

1555
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:13,000
Security says that a car entered the
hospital a couple of days ago at 11:00 PM...

1556
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,700
ID name: Lobna Al Kurdi...

1557
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,900
She was visiting you...

1558
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
and you left a note to the gate security.

1559
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:31,100
Yehia!

1560
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,500
Where have you been for
the past 5 years?

1561
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:38,300
Do you realize what isolation
could do to anyone?

1562
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,600
I am not sick, doctor.

1563
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,000
We haven't said that
you are sick, Yehia.

1564
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:49,000
Anyone who undergoes an
experience like yours

1565
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,000
is likely to go through
some thought disorders.

1566
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:54,000
Some people get out of this
state, gradually...

1567
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,800
Others never do.

1568
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:00,000
And, I didn't?

1569
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,100
That's what it looks like.

1570
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,400
And this is better than to consider other
possibilities, which you wouldn't like.

1571
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:10,300
But I didn't break the law, doctor?

1572
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:15,700
What happened is enough for escalating
the subject to the general secretariat.

1573
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:18,000
Which means you will be dismissed.

1574
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,100
That's an end, I wouldn't wish for you.

1575
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,200
To avoid that I will transfer
you from "8 west"

1576
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,800
to the senility department, "26".

1577
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:29,400
A quiet department, with little problems.

1578
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:30,900
You will be relieved there.

1579
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:35,500
Yehia!

1580
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:40,000
The last person to realize being sick
is the patient himself.

1581
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,800
I called you, you didn't answer
so I got worried.

1582
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:39,600
Lobna, what brought you here at this time?

1583
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,000
He came home and had a fight with me.

1584
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:52,000
He told me that I am an irresponsible
person, and that I have no feelings

1585
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,800
and a shame for his family
since what Sherif did

1586
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,500
which is of no fault of my own.

1587
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I told him we can get divorced.

1588
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,000
He accepted immediately.

1589
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,400
As if he was waiting for me to say it.

1590
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:20,700
He packed his stuff and left.

1591
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:27,800
Why are you so silent?

1592
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,300
Lobna, I left Sherif's case today.

1593
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:39,200
It wasn't my choice.

1594
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:43,000
Your brother told Sameh
that he killed his wife.

1595
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,500
And he also said that
I was threatening him.

1596
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:51,000
But...

1597
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:52,500
Sherif...

1598
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:55,100
Sherif is insane.

1599
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,200
Maybe I actually did those things.

1600
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:02,700
That's impossible.

1601
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,800
I am tired.

1602
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,400
Lobna, I am not ok.

1603
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,100
I don't know what I am doing.

1604
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:20,100
I can't tell reality from
imagination anymore.

1605
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,000
I hear things that never happened.

1606
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,100
And I see...

1607
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:29,500
I see things that didn't happen.

1608
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,000
I am not ok!

1609
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:36,000
Your brother might be saying the truth.

1610
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:48,200
You are drunk, Yehia.

1611
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,100
When I drink, I am usually sober.

1612
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,200
That's not it.

1613
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,000
All the symptoms that
I see on your brother...

1614
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,500
are actually mine.

1615
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,500
And I tell it as if they are his.

1616
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,500
But I haven't seen any symptoms on you.

1617
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:27,500
Yehia, you...

1618
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:31,100
You have got to stop drinking.

1619
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,000
You are going to become insane.

1620
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,500
If the whole world said
that you are sick

1621
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:41,500
I am telling you that you are not
Yehia, you are not.

1622
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:43,600
You are not sick, Yehia.

1623
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:48,100
You want to die.

1624
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,100
For the past 10 years
and I am unable to.

1625
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:02,200
I won't stand it, if you disappear
again from my life, after I found you.

1626
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:07,100
Stay in the dark.

1627
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:11,800
I am ok with that.

1628
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:19,600
At least I would be living for
a hope even a false one.

1629
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,500
But if you disappear
again from my life

1630
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:28,800
like the previous time
I won't forgive you, Yehia.

1631
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,100
I won't forgive you, Yehia.

1632
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:39,200
I will die.

1633
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:42,700
I will die, Yehia.

1634
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:16,300
Hello!

1635
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,200
Get behind!

1636
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:19,800
Thank you, sir!

1637
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:21,400
I am a doctor here.

1638
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:22,600
Not allowed.

1639
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,100
Dr. Safaa'!

1640
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:26,400
Dr. Safaa'!

1641
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,600
Open the door, please.

1642
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:30,400
Let him in.

1643
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,500
Sherif asked for you by name.

1644
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:40,000
He threatened that he will break
Sameh's neck, if we open the door.

1645
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,200
We won't have time to act.

1646
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,800
Please do something, Yehia.

1647
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,300
Get back...get back.

1648
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,400
I am going to need this device
with me, please.

1649
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,800
Here you go.

1650
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,000
Yehia!

1651
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:14,200
I can't stand seeing
these idiots, outside.

1652
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Take this.

1653
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:18,500
Make it pitch black.

1654
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:25,200
Don't make any noises, Sameh, be nice.

1655
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:29,000
Loosen it a bit, Sherif
he is going to die.

1656
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,500
Did you know that they
don't slaughter pigs?

1657
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:36,200
Because of the amount of
fat around it's neck.

1658
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,900
How they kill it then, boss.

1659
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:41,300
It has to be stabbed in the heart.

1660
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:43,400
But here...

1661
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:46,600
There are no skewers
don't you have one?

1662
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,500
Why don't you let Sameh out of this?

1663
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,500
You won't benefit from his death.

1664
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:57,700
What are you looking for?

1665
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:00,000
This?

1666
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,900
You don't need any device.

1667
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:11,400
Believe in yourself, doctor.

1668
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,300
You are sane.

1669
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,400
Believe me, I am here only to...

1670
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,700
To protect him.

1671
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,600
To protect him from your
crazy friend, Sherif.

1672
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,400
Protect him, by killing him, right?

1673
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:29,200
You are still not able to differentiate
between me and your crazy friend, Sherif.

1674
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:31,600
Try to understand...

1675
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,300
Sherif is the one who
wants him dead.

1676
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,200
For some reason that
I personally don't know.

1677
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,900
But me, on the other hand
you can consider me a peacemaker.

1678
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:40,000
Good!

1679
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:41,600
In that case...

1680
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:42,700
Then...

1681
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:56,900
Look, Yehia...

1682
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:01,000
I am willing to forgive
anything in the world

1683
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:04,200
except a bad sense of humour.

1684
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:44,700
I really can't understand
what you are trying to achieve.

1685
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:46,800
I will monitor myself using this camera

1686
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,300
under the effect of a new
type of medication.

1687
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:50,300
To make sure whether I am sane or not.

1688
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,300
Lobna, please, there is no time.

1689
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,500
Help me so I can help Sherif.

1690
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:04,000
I will lock myself inside
the room and give you the key.

1691
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,500
And tomorrow, at the same time
come and open the door for me.

1692
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:10,800
Don't worry.

1693
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:14,600
I know what I am doing.

1694
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:44,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

1695
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:47,500
And now, time for the
blue elephant performance.

1696
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:01,200
Mommy!...Mommy!

1697
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,100
Noor!

1698
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:43,000
Sir, Al Ma'moon.

1699
02:10:43,600 --> 02:10:44,600
Come closer.

1700
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:00,300
It's the devil possession, sir.

1701
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:02,800
Sorcerer!

1702
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:05,700
May she never be forgiven
she who tattooed your woman.

1703
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,600
She brought her a
vicious copulating demon.

1704
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Able to detect the talisman
half way across the world.

1705
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:13,000
It will manifest itself
in the form of a black dog.

1706
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:16,000
That will take possession of you
and knock you out like a dead person.

1707
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:18,300
Will copulate with your women
using your own body.

1708
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:20,100
Without you knowing.

1709
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:21,500
Maya!

1710
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,600
A warning, that you might keep away.

1711
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:24,800
Nael!

1712
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:28,000
Goes by the same name as his
grandfather Satan, in heaven

1713
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:30,000
before he disobeyed the
lord and got banished.

1714
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:34,500
O Lord!, Protector!
Guardian!, Full of Mercy!...

1715
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:36,200
Vomit, son, vomit.

1716
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:40,000
Everyday, you shall put your finger
in your throat and vomit.

1717
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:42,200
Empty your body, and fill it up with salt.

1718
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:44,700
Clean yourself and wash with salt.

1719
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:47,300
Salt is pure, will purify you.

1720
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:50,400
Salt keeps away the copulating demon...

1721
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,400
Burns it...

1722
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:52,600
Baffles it...

1723
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:53,900
And kills it...

1724
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,500
This shirt is your best protection.

1725
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:58,500
It has the name of God. Embroidered.

1726
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:00,000
Protected by 9 digits.

1727
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,300
That can not be read nor
interpreted by any demon.

1728
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:03,600
To arouse you, if it knocks you out.

1729
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:07,500
And brings the help of a
protector to assist you.

1730
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:09,800
Digits that will close
a shelter around you

1731
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:11,200
that can not be opened by
any type of weapon

1732
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,000
nor by Satan, using
whatever type of key

1733
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:15,000
nor by Nael the copulating demon.

1734
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:20,200
Get out of my face

1735
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,500
you and your stupid shirt.

1736
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:42,000
It won't leave you

1737
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:43,200
before it takes away

1738
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:45,200
your most precious belongings.

1739
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:48,800
The shirt!

1740
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:50,800
The shirt!

1741
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,500
The shirt!

1742
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Yehia!

1743
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:07,800
Are you ok?

1744
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,600
Are you worried about me?!

1745
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:20,100
How long have I been out?

1746
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:23,300
I don't know, but it's
almost morning, now.

1747
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:25,300
I couldn't leave you.

1748
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:58,700
On the 25th

1749
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,300
they arrested a woman who stole
some stuff from the bathroom.

1750
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,200
And they hanged her on Bab Zuweila
(One of Cairo's old gates)

1751
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:09,950
On Wednesday, the 7th

1752
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:12,900
a man called Al Ma'moon
killed his wife.

1753
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,300
A couple of days later

1754
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:17,000
he cut off his own arm
out of remorse for killing her.

1755
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:20,100
He was admitted to "Kalaoon Hospital"
for the insane.

1756
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,300
Then, what I saw has actually happened.

1757
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
It is mentioned in Aljabarti's
book that we found.

1758
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:33,400
What have you seen exactly, Yehia?

1759
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:37,100
I saw an identical life to Sherif's

1760
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,100
but in another time.

1761
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:41,500
The Shirt...

1762
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:42,700
Al Ma'moon...

1763
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:45,400
And all of what's mentioned here in detail.

1764
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,500
I am not sick.

1765
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,300
Excuse me.

1766
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,400
Excuse me.

1767
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:07,500
One second.

1768
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,400
I am doctor Yehia, from "8 west".

1769
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:11,300
Of course, I know you, Dr. Yehia.

1770
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,200
I am Mervat, responsible
for the females ward.

1771
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:14,700
Where is uncle Sayed?

1772
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:17,700
Uncle Sayed, the one always sitting
in that house, or by the tree.

1773
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:19,100
Uncle Sayed, the tailor...

1774
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:21,400
He died 4 years ago.

1775
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:23,300
This tree fell on him.

1776
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:26,000
He always loved sitting here.

1777
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:38,800
Hi...

1778
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,700
I hope you aren't upset from last time.

1779
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:50,800
Hi.

1780
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:00,400
First...

1781
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,800
No matter how much you scream
nobody will hear you.

1782
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:04,700
The door is locked outside.

1783
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,200
Second...

1784
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:10,200
The wimp working with you is lying on the
bathroom floor and wouldn't hear you anyway.

1785
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:12,100
Third...

1786
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,500
If you make any move
I will break you arm.

1787
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:17,000
What do you want?
Take whatever you want.

1788
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:19,000
I am not here to rob you.

1789
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,800
One question...

1790
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:23,400
Are you the one who
gave Basma the tattoo?

1791
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,600
I dealt with Sherif
not with his wife.

1792
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,200
I didn't say that she
is his wife, you lying whore.

1793
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:30,400
What tattoo did you give her?

1794
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,300
A flower.

1795
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:32,900
Bring the book from which you drew.

1796
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:34,000
I don't remember.

1797
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:35,600
Bring the book...get up!

1798
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:37,200
There!

1799
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:38,500
Bring it!

1800
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:45,500
A sinful talisman!

1801
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:47,400
Sorcery!

1802
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,000
This was not supposed to happen.

1803
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,000
Everytime it went just fine.

1804
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:53,500
But this time, it turned very differently.

1805
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,000
The whole story is a
tattoo that is drawn...

1806
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:58,300
And a spell that is read out loud.

1807
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,900
And gets eaten by a dog.

1808
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:02,600
Isn't it so?

1809
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,700
You dirty whore!

1810
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:06,600
Continue.

1811
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:08,300
Basma came to me...

1812
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,100
And told me that she was
in conflict with her husband.

1813
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:12,600
He was sick of her.

1814
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:15,600
And demons can do what Viagra can not.

1815
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:17,400
It comes...

1816
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:18,500
And takes possession of the man.

1817
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,900
And sleeps with his wife.

1818
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,000
And no one can ever know.

1819
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,200
And everyone is happy in the morning.

1820
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:27,900
Oh my God...

1821
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:31,000
This is how it goes.

1822
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:33,500
When sexual pleasure is achieved...

1823
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:34,800
Life goes on.

1824
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:36,100
If there is no sexual pleasure...

1825
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:38,300
We keep accusing each other...

1826
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:39,900
Coldness and weakness.

1827
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,200
And keep hurting each
other with dull knives.

1828
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:43,400
What about the dog?

1829
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:45,900
The dog that eats the spell
gets locked in the bathroom.

1830
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:48,800
For one week, till I make sure
that the woman is fine.

1831
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:50,700
And then I poison it.

1832
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:52,000
As soon as it dies...

1833
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,200
Everything goes back to normal.

1834
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:56,900
But this time, you didn't kill the dog?

1835
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:57,800
No.

1836
02:18:57,900 --> 02:18:59,200
The dog died of its own.

1837
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:02,200
I thought it was over.

1838
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:05,400
But in Basma's case, it was something else.

1839
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:07,700
Something that can not be dismissed.

1840
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:09,700
Something that I have never seen before.

1841
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:21,300
I understood the science of
converting letters to numbers.

1842
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:23,000
It is called Alawfa' (Numerology).

1843
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,500
Each letter has an equivalent number.

1844
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,100
And the meaning of the word

1845
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,300
when it is converted to numbers

1846
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:30,200
and is written in boxes

1847
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:32,000
the number acquires power.

1848
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:34,700
A hidden energy through which
demons can be harnessed.

1849
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:38,000
A calcaulation that can either protect
and would be called a veil.

1850
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:40,300
Or destroy and would be
called a curse.

1851
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:42,700
And this was the case
with Sherif and Basma.

1852
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:46,600
The shirt always had the numbers
protecting from Nael the copulating demon.

1853
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:49,500
The numbers translate to God's
name, The Protector.

1854
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,000
The only protection name

1855
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:53,200
able to stop Nael.

1856
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,600
As for each demon, there is a name

1857
02:19:55,700 --> 02:19:57,100
that weakens and expels it.

1858
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:58,900
Sherif was asking for it.

1859
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:02,000
And Nael was distracting me
trying to make me burn the shirt.

1860
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,200
Open.

1861
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:31,500
Sherif!

1862
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:43,700
Sherif!

1863
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:48,400
Yehia!

1864
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:50,500
I am dying.

1865
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:52,000
No, you won't die, Sherif.

1866
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:54,500
No one will.

1867
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,300
Don't ever give up.

1868
02:20:57,800 --> 02:20:58,700
Help me.

1869
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:15,500
What, Yehia?!

1870
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:19,300
Are you going to prevent me from
killing him, using a pen.

1871
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:27,200
The shirt, Sherif!

1872
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:34,100
What is this?, what happened?

1873
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,100
Wasn't I supposed to burn?

1874
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,100
I haven't seen this shirt
since a long time.

1875
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:44,200
You remind me of
school kids, Yehia.

1876
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:46,400
That always go to the principal
when they get into trouble.

1877
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:47,700
The highest rank!

1878
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:49,900
He is never able to protect them.

1879
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:53,800
Put the shirt on you son
you might catch a cold.

1880
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,200
Seriously, Yehia!

1881
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:01,500
Seriously!

1882
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,400
Sorcery and witchcraft!

1883
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:05,500
Is this how it ends for you?

1884
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:09,100
You are the last person I would imagine
following these superstitions.

1885
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,100
Shame on you!

1886
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:12,700
We are doctors!, for God's sake!

1887
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:15,600
What would the hospital
say about this now?

1888
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:17,300
We are encouraging ignorance.

1889
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:19,000
Instead of encouraging science.

1890
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:24,400
All of this because I tried to make you
see yourself more clearly!

1891
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,000
The shirt!

1892
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:41,100
Get out of my head!

1893
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,700
Instead of thanking me!

1894
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:45,800
Thanking you?!

1895
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:47,700
I said what you couldn't say.

1896
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:50,500
Freed your imaginations.

1897
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:51,600
That you were hiding.

1898
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:53,300
Without me

1899
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:55,200
would you've gained back your confidence?

1900
02:22:56,300 --> 02:22:58,000
Would you've gained back Lobna?

1901
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:02,400
Unfortunately, all of what
you are doing will change nothing.

1902
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:05,700
Can this bring back your daughter?

1903
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,100
What a poor kid!

1904
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:10,800
Of course you are thinking
she is in heaven now.

1905
02:23:12,100 --> 02:23:14,200
You should have seen
how she/it looks like.

1906
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:17,700
Who?

1907
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:18,800
Heaven.

1908
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,300
It has everything you can imagine.

1909
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:23,100
But it's boring.

1910
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:25,500
The real life...

1911
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:26,900
is here.

1912
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Action!

1913
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:32,800
Sherif!

1914
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:34,200
My name is...

1915
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:38,000
NA'EL!

1916
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
(Unintelligible demon talk)

1917
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:56,000
(Unintelligible demon talk)

1918
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:59,000
(Unintelligible demon talk)

1919
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:08,900
(Unintelligible demon talk)

1920
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:13,300
(Unintelligible demon talk)

1921
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:17,800
(Unintelligible demon talk)

1922
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:27,800
"The Protector"

1923
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,400
Sherif!

1924
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:10,600
Sherif!

1925
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:16,500
You are the one who sent the letter...

1926
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,600
Right?

1927
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,800
I used to lose consciousness...

1928
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:30,300
for days.

1929
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:33,500
And then wake up...

1930
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,900
To find everything has changed.

1931
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,700
Then I thought about you.

1932
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:44,200
Despite all of what
happened between us...

1933
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,700
I knew...

1934
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:51,600
that you would never give up on me.

1935
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:53,900
Nor on Lobna.

1936
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:55,600
<i>"8 west" final report showed</i>

1937
02:25:55,700 --> 02:25:58,900
<i>that Sherif might not have been
responsible for the crime he commited.</i>

1938
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:01,700
<i>Doubt tipped the scales in his favor.</i>

1939
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,500
<i>He was admitted to "Al Khankah Hospital".</i>

1940
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,000
<i>To be treated till he becomes sane again.</i>

1941
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:07,400
<i>And he might go out.</i>

1942
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:13,400
<i>Life granted me another chance.</i>

1943
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:17,200
<i>I became a new person
after this experience.</i>

1944
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:20,000
<i>A person prepared for life.</i>

1945
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:23,600
<i>And left a whole world behind me.</i>

1946
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:26,800
<i>And asked for forgiveness.</i>

1947
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:44,700
<i>But the difference between reality
and imagination will always be...</i>

1948
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:46,300
<i>A door...</i>

1949
02:26:47,700 --> 02:26:48,800
<i>Called curiosity.</i>

1950
02:26:50,250 --> 02:26:51,900
