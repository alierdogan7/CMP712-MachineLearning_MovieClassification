332

- You don't have to sulk about it.
- I'm not sulking.

333
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,204
I see exactly what you mean.

334
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,374
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?

335
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,211
- We'll go!
- No, we don't have to if you don't want to.

No, no, no. Sit down, please.

- Thank you.

Mr. Woodhouse,

- Yes, thanks.
- Have you ever tasted one?

356

- Brand-new carpet.

- Oh, no, no.

365

I've been there, though.

366
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,629
I've been everywhere, literally.

367

368

- [Guy] Fairbanks, Alaska.

369

Been all over Alaska.

Yes, Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage...

I'm from Omaha.
Guy's from Baltimore.

375
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,734
Omaha's a good city.
Baltimore is too.

376
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,363
- Do you travel for business?
- Well, business and pleasure both.

377
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,824
I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was ten.

381

[Roman] No pope ever visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.

382

That's exactly what it is.

387
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,561

- You're not religious, my dear, are you?

388
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,731
Well, I-I was brought up a Catholic.
Now I don't know.

389
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,193
- Yeah. You looked uncomfortable.
- Well, he is the pope.

390
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,529
Well, now, you don't need
to have respect for him...

391
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,531
because he pretends that he's holy.

392
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,366
[Guy]
Now, that's a good point.

393
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,327
When I think what they spend
on robes and jewels!

394
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,206
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organized religion...

395
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,208
was given, I thought, in Luther.

396
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,669
Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?

397
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,337
Me? No.

398
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,715
Well, weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?

399
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,717
- No.
- Well, that's strange.

400
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,136
I remember being struck by a gesture you made...

401
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,763
and checking in the program to see who you were.

402
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,224
- Thank you.
- Um, what gesture was that?

403
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,728
Well, I'm not sure now.
It was a reaction, uh...

404
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,856
I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

405
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,818
- It was a kind of involuntary reaching.
- That's it. That's it.

406
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:37,488
- It had a wonderful authenticity to it.
- [Guy Chuckles] Come on, now.

No, no. I mean it.

408
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,118

409
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,495

410

Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.

411

- Oh, yes, please.

413
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,633

It should take you a long way indeed...

414

that you get those initial breaks.

Um, well, I'm up for a couple parts.

that you won't get them.
- Well, I can.

- Mm-hmm. Three brothers and two sisters.

421
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,909
- Your sisters married?
- Mm-hmm.

422

- They have children?
- One has two. The other has four.

you'll have lots of children too.

01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,181
See the eyes?

1314
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,643
- A coincidence.
- In the same house?

1315
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,395
And look. Look here.

1316
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,023
"Soon after that, in August 1886...

1317
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:11,108
his son Steven was born."

1318
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:14,320
1886. Got it?
That makes him 79 now.

1319
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,363
No coincidence.

1320
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:23,078
No, I guess not.

1321
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:25,915
He's Steven Marcato, all right.

1322
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,417
Poor old geezer.
With a crazy father like that...

1323
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,628
no wonder he switched his name around.

1324
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,172
You... You don't think
he's the same?

1325
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:35,466
What do you mean? A witch?

1326
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:38,719
Ro, are you kidding?
Oh, Ro, honey.

1327
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,264
His father was a martyr to it.

1328
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,476
- Do you know how he died?
- Honey, it's 1966.

1329
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:47,811
This was published in 1933.

1330
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:50,147
There were covens in Europe...
that's what they're called...

1331
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,316
the, uh... the congregation...

1332
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:56,820
covens in Europe, in America, and in
Australia, and they have one right here.

1333
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:59,907
That whole bunch... the parties with
the singing and the flute and the chanting...

1334
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:02,993
- those are esbats or sabbaths
or whatever they're called.
- Honey, don't get excited.

1335
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:06,664
Read what they do, Guy!
They use blood in their rituals...

1336
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,333
and the blood that has
the most power is baby's blood.

1337
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,669
And they don't just use the blood.
They use the flesh too.

1338
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,504
Rosemary, for God sakes!

1339
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,006
They're not setting foot
in this apartment ever again.

1340
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,050
And they're not coming
within 50 feet of the baby.

1341
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,844
They're old people.
They have a bunch of old friends.

1342
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:23,430
Dr. Shand happens
to play the recorder.

1343
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,100
I'm not taking any chances
with the baby's safety.

1344
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,269
- We're gonna sublet and move out.
- We are not.

1345
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:31,021
- Oh, yes, we are.
- We'll talk about it later.

1346
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:37,403
And I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1347
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:40,030
- Just this last chapter.
- Not today, honey.

1348
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,575
Look, your hands are shaking.
Now, come on. Give it to me.

1349
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:45,411
- You'll read it tomorrow.
- Guy...

1350
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,455
I mean it, now.
Give it to me.

1351
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:58,966
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

1352
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:01,302
- What'd you say the name was? Machado?
- [Rosemary] Marcato.

1353
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:04,346
Fantastic. I think he told me once
his father was a coffee importer.

1354
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,015
He told Guy he was a producer.

1355
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:09,059
I understand how disturbed you must be
to have him for a close neighbor.

1356
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,770
I don't want anything more
to do with him. Or Minnie.

1357
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:15,566
- I can't take the slightest chance
where the baby's safety is concerned.
- Absolutely.

1358
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,735
Any mother would feel the same way.

1359
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,154
Is there any chance at all that maybe...

1360
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,574
Minnie put something harmful
in those drinks or those little cakes?

1361
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,411
No, Rosemary.
I'd have seen evidence of it long ago.

1362
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,456
- I won't take anything else from her.
- You won't have to.

1363
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:33,917
I can give you some pills
that'll be adequate these last few weeks.

1364
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:37,254
In a way, this may be...

1365
01:34:37,422 --> 01:34:39,923
the answer to Minnie and Roman's problem too.

1366
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,760
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.

1367
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,636
In fact, confidentially...

1368
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,930
he has no more than a month or two left.

1369
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:50,809
- I had no idea.
- He wanted to pay a last visit
to a few of his favorite cities.

1370
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:54,271
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the baby's birth.

1371
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:56,607
I'm sorry to hear that Roman isn't well.

1372
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:59,985
He'd be extremely embarrassed
if he knew what you found out.

1373
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:03,113
Suppose we do this:
I'll tell them to leave on Sunday.

1374
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,324
I'll say I spoke to you, and you understand.

1375
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:08,911
- Are you sure they'll leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.

1376
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,996
[Whistle Blowing]

1377
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:12,998
[Minnie]
No matter where we are...

1378
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,709
our thoughts are gonna be with you
every minute, darlin'...

1379
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,711
till you're all happy and thin again...

1380
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,297
and your sweet little boy or girl's
layin' safe in your arms.

1381
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,299
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

1382
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:24,510
Yeah, you make Guy send us
lots of pictures, hear?

1383
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:26,095
Yes, I will.

1384
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:28,931
I'm not going to wish you good luck,
because you won't need it.

1385
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:31,475
You're going to have a happy, happy life.

1386
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,936
Have a good trip, and come back safely.

1387
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:35,979
Mm, perhaps.
But I may stay on...

1388
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:39,733
in Dubrovnik or Pescara or maybe Majorca.

1389
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,735
We shall see. We shall see.

1390
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,404
- Come back.
- Bye, Minnie.

1391
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,239
- Yeah, good-bye.
- Good-bye, Roman.

1392
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:47,825
- Bye. Good-bye.
- Take care, now.

1393
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:51,870
- Kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building, please.
- [All Shouting Good-byes]

1394
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,126
Oh, boy.

1395
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,216
- [Rosemary] Guy?
- Hmm?

1396
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:06,135
Where's my book?

1397
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,012
Oh, I, uh, put it in the garbage.

1398
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:14,685
- What?
- I didn't want you
upsetting yourself anymore.

1399
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:18,230
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.

1400
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,024
- I wasn't thinking about that.
- That's a terrible thing to do.

1401
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:23,193
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1402
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,245
- [Man] Hey, watch out, lady!
- [Tires Screech]

1403
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,330
[Horns Honking]

1404
01:37:26,883 --> 01:37:28,759
"In some cults it was believed...

1405
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:32,137
that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary...

1406
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,139
and spells could not be cast...

1407
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:37,142
without one of the victim's belongings."

1408
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,229
- [Man] Yeah?
- Is this Donald Baumgart?

1409
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:43,565
- That's right.
- This is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1410
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,192
- Oh.
- Guy Woodhouse's wife?

1411
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:47,402
- Oh, yes.
- I wanted to know...

1412
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:50,280
My God, you must be
a happy little lady these days, huh?

1413
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,950
Living in the Bram.
Rows of uniformed lackeys.

1414
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:55,327
I wanted to know how you are,
if there's been any improvement.

1415
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:58,664
Well, bless your heart.
[Chuckling]

1416
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,833
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
Well, I'm splendid.

1417
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,378
I've only broke six glasses today.

1418
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,423
Guy and I are both very unhappy...

1419
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:12,135
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1420
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:17,224
Well, what the hell, huh?

1421
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,810
That's the way it goes, right?

1422
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:24,064
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1423
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,650
Vi... Visit? No.

1424
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,237
Oh, you mean the day we met for drinks, huh?

1425
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:33,240
- Yes, that's what I meant.
- Right, right.

1426
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,076
By the way, he has something of yours, you know.

1427
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:38,328
What do you mean?

1428
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:40,914
- Don't you... Don't you know?
- No.

1429
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,166
Didn't you miss anything that day?

1430
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,671
You... You don't mean
my tie, do you?

1431
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:49,923
- Yes.
- Oh. Well...

1432
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:52,843
Well, he's got mine, and I've got his.

1433
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:55,012
- He can have it back.
- I'm sor...

1434
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:59,182
It doesn't matter to me now what, uh...
[Chuckles] color tie I'm wearing.

1435
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,685
I didn't understand.
I thought he'd only borrowed it.

1436
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:04,855
No, no, no, no.
It was... It was a trade.

1437
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:08,150
Or do you think he stole it?

1438
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:10,152
I have to hang up now.

1439
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:13,155
I just wanted to know
if there'd been any improvement.

1440
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,990
No. No, there isn't.

1441
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,534
It was nice of you to call. Bye.

[Woman]
You aren't in labor, are you?

1443
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:59,618
No, but I have to see the doctor.
It's very important.

1444
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:03,330
Well, he has to leave at 5:00,
and there is Mrs. Byron.

1445
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:06,291
- I'm sure he'll see you. Just sit down.
- Thank you.

1446

[Woman]
How is it out there?

1447
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,735
- Oh, awful. Ninety-four.
- Uh!

1448
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,947
- [Dr. Sapirstein] See you next week.
Make an appointment.
- [Woman] Yes, I will.

1449
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:45,455
- You're due any day now, aren't you?
- Tuesday.

1450
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:48,875
- You're smart to get it over with
before August.
- Yeah.

1451
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,505
Mrs. Byron.
He'll see you right after.

1452
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:55,590
- Thank you.
- Let's see.

1453
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:59,010
- July the 10th?
- Um, what time?

1454
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:01,138
- 4:00?
- Fine.
- All righty.

1455
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:03,098
- See you then.
- Thank you.

1456
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:05,267
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Good luck.

1457
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,185
Thank you.

[Door Opens, Shuts]

1459
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,653
Mmm. That smells nice.
What is it?

1460
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,241
Oh, my...
It's called Detchema.

1461
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:23,034
Mm.
Well, it's a big improvement...

1462
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:25,704
on your regular, if you don't mind my saying.

1463
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:29,416
That wasn't a perfume. That was
a good-luck charm. I threw it away.

1464
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:33,003
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.

1465
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,970
- Dr. Sapirstein?
- He has the aftershave.

1466
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:45,682
But it isn't, is it? [Chuckles]
I don't think he has a good-luck charm.

1467
01:41:45,808 --> 01:41:48,727
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while, whatever it is...

1468
01:41:48,853 --> 01:41:51,938
and when he does... oh, boy!

1469
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,899
Haven't you ever noticed?

1470
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,650
No.

1471
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:58,612
Maybe you thought it was
your own you were smelling.

1472
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:01,782
What is it, a chemical thing?

1473
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:04,367
Will you excuse me a moment, please?

1474
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:07,746
My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something.

1475
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:10,040
I'll be back in a minute.

1476
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:31,228
[Muttering]

1477
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,085
[Line Ringing]

1478
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,382
- [Woman] Dr. Hill's office.
- Dr. Hill, please.

1479
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:04,386
This is his answering service.
Would you like to leave a message?

1480
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:06,513
Ye... Uh, yes.

1481
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,891
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
Woodhouse.

1482
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:13,687
And, um, would you ask him
to call me back right away, please?

1483
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,814
Uh, my number is...

1484
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,776
475-2598.

1485
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,028
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1486
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:23,780
All right.

1487
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:36,334
Quickly please, Dr. Hill.
Call me.

1488
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:46,511
Oh... Oh, really?
Did... did he really say that?

1489
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:49,097
Oh, he didn't say that!

1490
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:51,641
What else was it that he said?

1491
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:53,643
Oh, that... that's wonderful.

1492
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:55,812
That's won...
That's mar... marvelous.

1493
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:57,772
- [Ringing]
- Yes, Dr. Hill?

1494
01:43:57,899 --> 01:44:00,275
[Woman] Did I get the name right?
Is it Rosemary Woodhouse?

1495
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:03,361
- Yes.
- Are you Dr. Hill's patient?

1496
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,447
No. Uh, yes.

1497
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,741
I mean, well, I've seen him once.

1498
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:11,077
Um, please, please tell him
he has to speak to me.

1499
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:14,164
It's important.
Tell him to call me, hmm?

1500
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,249
- All right.
- Thank you.

1501
01:44:23,341 --> 01:44:26,551
All of them. All of them.

1502
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,678
All in it together.

1503
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:31,431
All of them...
All of Them Witches.

1504
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,476
Don't you worry, little Andy or Jenny.

1505
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,978
I'll kill them before I let them touch you.

1506
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:43,026
- [Ringing]
- Yes? Doctor...

1507
01:44:43,152 --> 01:44:44,861
- Mrs. Woodhouse?
- Yes.

1508
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:47,364
Oh, thank you, thank you for calling me.

1509
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,367
- I thought you were in California.
- No.

1510
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:53,119
No, I've been to another doctor...

1511
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,622
and he isn't good, Dr. Hill.

1512
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,999
He's been lying to me and giving me...

1513
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,461
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.

1514
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:04,881
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28?

1515
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:07,550
- Well, I want you to deliver it.
- Mrs. Woodhouse...

1516
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,303
No, please, let me...
let me talk to you.

1517
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:13,223
Let me come and explain what's been going on.

1518
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:15,266
I can't stay too long here.

1519
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:17,852
They'll be coming looking for me.

1520
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:21,022
Dr. Hill?
Dr. Hill, there's a plot.

1521
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,858
I know that sounds crazy.
You're probably thinking...

1522
01:45:23,985 --> 01:45:26,069
"My God, this poor girl
has really flipped."

1523
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:28,238
But I haven't flipped, Dr. Hill.

1524
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,907
I swear by all the saints I haven't.

1525
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,576
There are plots against people, aren't there?

1526
01:45:33,703 --> 01:45:35,620
Yes, I suppose there are.

1527
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:40,000
Well, there's one against me and my baby.

1528
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:42,752
Come to my office tomorrow
after 5:00, and we'll...

1529
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,296
Now. Right now.

1530
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:47,966
Mrs. Woodhouse, I'm not
at my office now. I'm home.

1531
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:51,011
- I've been up since yesterday morning...
- I beg you!

1532
01:45:51,137 --> 01:45:53,513
I beg you.

1533
01:45:53,639 --> 01:45:55,598
I can't stay here.

1534
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,144
- My office at 8:00.
- Yes. Thank you.

1535
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,104
- All right.
- Oh, wait. Dr. Hill?

1536
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,607
- Yes?
- My husband may call you and ask if...

1537
01:46:04,734 --> 01:46:07,444
I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap.

1538
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,320
Thank you.

1539
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,856
Keep the change.

1540
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:48,651
Driver, please, could you wait and watch...

1541
01:46:48,819 --> 01:46:50,987
until I'm inside the door?

1542
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:10,006
He lied to you.
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1543
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,884
The worst thing of all...
he's involved with them as well.

1544
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:16,012
He sleeps in pajamas now.
He never used to before.

1545
01:47:16,138 --> 01:47:18,014
He's probably hiding a mark.

1546
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,558
You know, they give you marks when you join.

1547
01:47:20,684 --> 01:47:23,853
All sorts of rituals.
They hold sabbaths there.

1548
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,022
You could hear them singing through the wall.

1549
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,900
Guy... my husband, Guy...
said it was Dr. Shand...

1550
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:31,653
one of these people, playing a recorder.

1551
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:35,698
Now, how did he know it was Dr. Shand
unless he was there with them?

1552
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:39,285
Uh, they're very clever people.

1553
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,704
They planned everything
right from the beginning.

1554
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:44,874
They probably made some sort of deal with Guy.

1555
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:47,418
They gave him success, and he promised them...

1556
01:47:47,545 --> 01:47:50,171
our baby to use in their rituals.

1557
01:47:51,257 --> 01:47:55,385
I know this sounds crazy, but I've...
I've got books here.

1558
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,387
Look.

1559
01:47:57,513 --> 01:48:00,849
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart...

1560
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:02,851
and they put a spell on him.

1561
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:05,228
They cast a spell on him and made him blind...

1562
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,230
so that Guy could get his part.

1563
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,149
Look. Here.

1564
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:14,612
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins.
Maybe you heard of him.

1565
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:16,865
A writer.
He wrote stories for boys.

1566
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,993
Anyway, he was my good friend
since I first came to New York.

1567
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:22,662
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.

1568
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,664
And, uh, anyway...

1569
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:27,834
once Mr. Hutchins came to visit me.

1570
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:32,213
Came to visit me. It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1571
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,884
I was suffering so... You can't imagine
how much I was suffering.

1572
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,261
And they wouldn't help me.
Nobody would.

1573
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:41,514
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it...

1574
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,517
also witches' stuff, tannis root.

1575
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:47,770
Hutch came, and he immediately
saw something was wrong.

1576
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,190
He knew about witches, you see?

1577
01:48:50,316 --> 01:48:54,402
Suddenly, Guy rushed in with his makeup
still on, which he never did.

1578
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,613
They probably called him to come home...

1579
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,449
and steal one of Hutch's belongings,
which he did.

1580
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:02,535
Took his glove.
And they put a spell on him too.

1581
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,955
Put him in a coma.
Three months later, he died.

1582
01:49:07,499 --> 01:49:10,835
Now, maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure:

1583
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,254
They have a coven, and they want my baby.

1584
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:18,968
It certainly seems that way.

1585
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,980
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

1586
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:32,815
I don't believe in witchcraft...

1587
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:35,652
but there're plenty of maniacs
and crazy people in this city.

1588
01:49:35,778 --> 01:49:38,112
The doctor's name is Shand, you say?

1589
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:41,157
No, Dr. Shand
is one of these people.

1590
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:43,576
The doctor's name is Sapirstein.

1591
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,079
Abraham Sapirstein?

1592
01:49:47,331 --> 01:49:48,998
Yeah.

1593
01:49:49,959 --> 01:49:52,877
- Do you know him?
- I've met him once or twice.

1594
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:54,921
To look at him, you'd never think he...

1595
01:49:55,047 --> 01:49:58,049
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

1596
01:49:58,175 --> 01:50:00,343
Would you like to go into Mount Sinai right now?

1597

This evening?

1598
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:05,848
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

1599
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,518
It's difficult. We'll try.

1600
01:50:08,686 --> 01:50:11,020
I want you to lie down and get some rest.

1601
01:50:11,188 --> 01:50:12,605
Thanks.

1602
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:15,775
Anything they've got.
Even a broom closet would be fine.

1603
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,361
I hope we can do better than that.

1604
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:26,744
I'll see what I can do,
and then I'll check you over.

1605
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:32,041
Should I undress now?

1606
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:34,335
No, it'll take me about
a half an hour on the telephone.

1607
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:36,462
You just lie down. Rest.

1608

- Okay?
- Okay.

Everything's gonna be okay now, Andy or Jenny.

1611

Be a real mother to Adrian.
You don't have to join if you don't want to.

I mean, supposing
you had the baby and you lost it?
