00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,476
Welcome to this very
special rush evening

6
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,045
of the new and improved
Kappa Kappa Tau.

7
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm Zayday Williams, president,

8
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,716
and this is my vice
president, Grace Gardner.

9
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,418
We would also like to thank Dean Munsch

10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,620
for allowing us to have a
winter semester rush this year.

11
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,456
Well, now that the unfortunate events

12
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,625
of the fall semester are behind us

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,795
and the school is back
open and extremely safe,

14
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,597
I thought, why not?

15
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,267
Especially since the new Kappa
seems to be aligned so clearly

16
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,469
with mine and the rest
of the student body's

17
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,873
almost militant commitment
to political correctness

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,809
and acceptance of different
and unusual points of view.

19
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,111
As long as they're always left-leaning.

20
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,913
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:52,684
I'm gonna go disinvite Jerry Seinfeld
from speaking at commencement.

22
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,753
He told a joke about a woman once.

23
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,754
Allegedly.

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,755
(women murmur)

25
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,592
We would also like to introduce
you to our treasurer,

Hester Ulrich.

27
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,232
Excuse me. Is it still true that you
guys take anyone who wants to pledge?

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,901
It's actually now written
in the Kappa bylaws.

29
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,104
So today is going to
be filled with us...

30
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,106
HESTER: <i>Hi. It's me, Hester.</i>

yourself in the eye</i>

<i>with a stiletto heel is that you know</i>

34
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,748
<i>just where to jab it in order
to miss the important organs,</i>

35
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,683
<i>like your optic nerve or your brain.</i>

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,985
<i>You might have noticed that
I'm the only Chanel left.</i>

37
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,154
<i>That's because I got away with it.</i>

38
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,989
<i>It was a plan 20 years in the making,</i>

39
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,758
<i>and it worked.</i>

- Now, this is a hammer.

59
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,801
Hammers are good for bashing
people in the skull

60
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,003
and watching them bleed to death, okay?

61
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,005
Now, how about this?

62
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,207
- Knife!
- Okay.

63
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,842
How about this one?

64
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,344
- Chain saw.
- Great!

65
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,312
Now, what are the
advantages of using this?

66
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,648
Easily cuts through muscle and bone,

67
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,216
and has the added
advantage of making sure

68
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,218
your victim's final emotion is terror.

69
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,252
Suck ass!

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,254
That's great, Hester.

71
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,756
Now, let's maybe let Boone
answer the next one.

72
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,725
- But he's a moron.
- I know.

73
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,660
I know.

74
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,095
Ow!

75
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,832
(children grunting)

76
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,834
HESTER: <i>We grew. Time passed.</i>

77
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,235
<i>It did get a little lonely there.</i>

78
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,371
<i>Sometimes I made friends,</i>

79
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,872
<i>but then the next thing you know,</i>

80
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,707
<i>they're getting a full
frontal lobotomy.</i>

81
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,749
<i>Gigi said that we would
be headed to Wallace</i>

82
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,550
<i>to finally put our plan into action,</i>

83
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,086
<i>so I needed a persona to hide behind</i>

84
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,224
<i>while we murdered people and stuff.</i>

85
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>Boone decided that his would
be to pretend to be gay,</i>

86
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,648
<i>which made, like, no sense,
since all that would do is</i>

87
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,318
<i>make him stand out amongst
those frat dudes.</i>

88
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,096
<i>But Boone was never one
for really being smart.</i>

89
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,665
<i>As for me, what I've noticed is that</i>

90
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,400
<i>the more weird and gross you are,</i>

91
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,702
<i>the less people want to know about you.</i>

92
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,370
<i>No one asks the kid with terrible acne</i>

93
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,073
<i>what their favorite movie
is or where they were born.</i>

94
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,708
<i>Even though I only ate asylum food</i>

95
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,276
<i>and never really
exercised, I was blessed</i>

96
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,878
<i>with a super tight bod.</i>

97
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,780
<i>My butt could launch a thousand ships,</i>

98
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,815
<i>and my boobs were
remarkably perky and even.</i>

99
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,717
<i>Couple that with my BJ lips,</i>

100
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,819
<i>and I was gonna need
something pretty spectacular</i>

101
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,388
<i>to keep everyone from wanting
to get all up in this.</i>

102
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:48,260
<i>Once I saw her, I knew I found
my cloak of social invisibility.</i>

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,299
(thunder rumbling)

104
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,409
<i>We needed a cool costume.</i>

105
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,744
<i>All killers have a cool costume...</i>

106
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,546
<i>Jason with his hockey mask,</i>

107
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,347
<i>Freddy Krueger's sweater and hat,</i>

108
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,584
<i>Cujo's totally realistic dog costume.</i>

109
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,089
Hey, everyone!

110
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,424
Come down to Jesse
Helms Stadium tonight

111
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,728
to cheer on our very
own Wallace University

112
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,163
Red Devils!

113
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,066
Kickoff at 7:00 p.m.! (whoops)

114
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,276
<i>(knife stabbing, man gasping)</i>

115
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,811
HESTER: <i>Kind of ironic
that our first victim</i>

116
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,480
<i>was actually the Red Devil,</i>

117
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,714
<i>but when you want to
make an omelet, right?</i>

118
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,783
(nife stabbing, man gasping)

119
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,321
<i>But the devil outfit was perfect.</i>

120
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,189
<i>Unisex, kind of satanic</i>

121
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,791
<i>but not, like, a giant
goat head satanic.</i>

122
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,026
<i>Red and black so it wouldn't stain</i>

123
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,461
<i>when it was covered in blood.</i>

124
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,330
<i>And since it was the school mascot,</i>

125
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,599
<i>we could walk around campus
in it without being noticed.</i>

126
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,300
GIGI: I think he's dead.

127
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,702
HESTER: <i>It was time to begin.</i>

128
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,238
<i>We broke into Kappa and we got busy.</i>

129
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,308
BOONE: I don't understand why

130
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,943
we don't just stab this Dorkus girl.

131
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,645
Because this is more dramatic.

132
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,847
I don't know. Stabbing
can be pretty dramatic.

133
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:20,018
No, this is more poetic. It hits
these girls right in their vanity.

134
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,686
Wait, we're spraying
acid on the furniture?

135
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,054
How's that gonna hurt them?

136
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,724
Just pour the acid in!

137
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,726
HESTER: <i>Obvi, I was the
brains of the operation.</i>

138
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,798
<i>Boone was the muscle, and Gigi was the
weird and psycho beating black heart.</i>

139
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,767
<i>We did have to get into college
before we could execute our plan.</i>

140
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,169
<i>Hard, since we never
went to high school.</i>

141
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,304
Boone went undercover
<i>year before I did.</i>

142
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,306
<i>never actually rolled in school.</i>

143
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,308
<i>Since none of those frat
guys ever went to class,</i>

144
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,943
<i>it was easy to just show up there,</i>

145
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,745
<i>say he was a student,
and blend right in.</i>

146
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,746
<i>But I wanted to do it right.</i>

147
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,572
Well, Hester,

148
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,583
your high school transcripts
are clearly faked.

149
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,554
And I'm guessing you
made up your SAT scores,

150
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,722
'cause it's not possible to get
one million percent on them.

151
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,291
Now, that being said,

152
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,560
we do have a new mandate
here at Wallace University

153
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,495
for special needs diversity.

154
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,332
And seeing as we have no students
with severe spinal deformities,

155
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,570
I... am gonna take a chance on you.

156
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,338
(stamp thuds)

157
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,707
Welcome to Wallace.

158
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,909
Thank you, Dean. You won't regret it.

159
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,911
(footsteps echoing)

160
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:23,682
Hi.

161
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:25,750
Ooh, cool neck brace.

162
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,618
You ever think about decorating it?

163
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,786
(gasps)

164
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,054
I've got a Bedazzler back in my room.

165
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,789
What do you say we spice it up a bit?

166
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,792
Um, no. But that sounds
like a lot of fun.

167
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,727
I hope you guys aren't
freaked out by my appearance

168
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,229
or lack of social skills and money.

169
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,764
Hardly. We're part of a new
wave of Kappa Kappa Tau,

170
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,133
one filled with true
sisterhood and acceptance.

171
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,636
Zayday here is gonna be president
of this place someday.

172
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,204
Come on. Let's go mingle, babies.

173
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,806
I'll catch up.

174
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,041
By the way, you guys seem really nice.

175
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,744
I've always said that being
nice is a really good quality.

176
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,613
It could save your life one day.

177
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,947
Hmm.

178
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,415
(chuckles) Great.

179
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,584
HESTER: <i>And so it came to be</i>

180
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,587
<i>that Hester Ulrich,
daughter of Sophia Doyle,</i>

181
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,390
<i>returned to Kappa House
to get her revenge.</i>

182
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,392
<i>And that was the night it all started.</i>

183
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,427
<i>And tonight, it all ends.</i>

184
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,429
<i>Order is restored, as they say.</i>

185
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,231
<i>More than restored... reborn.</i>

186
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,301
<i>Now I have some true
sisters, some real family.</i>

187
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,637
<i>The only dad I ever had was the asylum.</i>

188
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,872
<i>My only family were those
nutburgers Gigi and Boone.</i>

189
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,074
<i>But now I know who my real dad is</i>

190
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,410
<i>and my real half-sister,
even if they don't.</i>

191
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,912
<i>And the best part is</i>

192
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,346
<i>that that isn't even the best part.</i>

193
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,282
<i>Well, that isn't the best part either.</i>

194
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,817
<i>The best part is who
isn't up here with us.</i>

195
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,819
<i>Yep. No Chanels.</i>

196
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,122
<i>I mean, someone had to
take all the blame.</i>

197
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:38,623
<i>Right?</i>

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,630
_

199
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,469
HESTER: <i>You're probably
thinking, what kind of person</i>

200
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,604
<i>could drive a six-inch stiletto
into her own eye socket?</i>

201
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:49,772
Hester, it's gonna be
okay, it's gonna be okay.

202
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,474
(whispers): Can we save the shoe?

203
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,576
HESTER: <i>A person who did
her homework, that's who!</i>

204
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:58,814
<i>First, I had to get an
X-ray of my own skull.</i>

205
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,918
<i>Then, I had to calculate the
proper length of the heel,</i>

206
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,452
<i>the angle of the insertion,</i>

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,288
<i>with just the right amount of force</i>

208
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,357
<i>to slip behind the eyeball
without damaging the socket.</i>

209
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:10,359
<i>Also, it helps to be
completely frickin' insane.</i>

210
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:11,894
(panting softly)

211
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:15,631
<i>Because for a plan like this to work,</i>

212
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,535
<i>you have to be willing
to totally commit.</i>

213
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,204
(screams)

214
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,372
<i>I mean, desperate times call
for desperate measures.</i>

215
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,274
<i>This was the price I
had to pay if I wanted</i>

216
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:28,110
<i>to get away with murder and
pin it all on someone else.</i>

217
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:29,545
(whimpers)

218
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:30,646
(gasps)

219
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:32,481
(gasping)

220
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,449
The Red Devil!

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,455
<i>Because some people don't
deserve to just get murdered.</i>

222
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,457
They need to be truly punished.

223
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,658
I didn't do it, I swear!

224
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,760
Oh, please, we all know
the guy from Nickelback

225
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,929
did not, in fact, swipe
right on your profile.

226
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:50,533
Uh, yes, he did, okay? Nickelback is in
town playing some kid's bat mitzvah.

227
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,635
Please! It was clearly a ruse

228
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,504
so you could sneak back into
the house and kill Number Six!

229
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,306
I would never, Chanel!

230
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,374
I'm one of the good guys!

231
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,775
Look, I-I know,

232
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,577
I know that I can be socially awkward

233
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,779
and-and a little bit off-putting

234
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,582
and that most people find it
very difficult to be around me,

235
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,917
but you know me, Chanel.

236
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:09,819
I'm not the killer.

237
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,787
Um, excuse me?

238
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,489
I think you're a serial killer

239
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,024
because I know you, Number Five!

240
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,125
You bite your own toenails.

241
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,827
Okay, I am flexible.

242
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:20,496
Why would I waste my money
buying toenail clippers

243
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:22,765
when God already blessed
me with toenail clippers

244
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,134
in the form of teeth in my mouth?!

245
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:27,503
It's awfully convenient that
you're the one who noticed

246
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,604
- Number Two's body went missing.
- (gasps)

247
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:30,172
Maybe you knew it was gone

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,141
'cause you'd already taken it
to the house on Shady Lane.

249
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,510
Look, we should all just stay up

250
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,979
and wait until Number Five
gets tired and passes out.

251
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,248
She confesses all sorts of
crazy stuff in her sleep.

252
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,717
She and I were roommates the first
year we lived in the house.

253
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,519
I unlocked the brakes
on Grandma's wheelchair

254
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,421
so that she would slide down
the driveway into the traffic.

255
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,656
Shut up!

256
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,424
Go to sleep!

257
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:51,394
When I fart, I cup it in
my hand and smell it.

258
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:54,063
Dear God, shut up!

259
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:56,499
CHANEL: Wait a minute.
Everybody, shut up!

260
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,867
I know what happened.

261
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,268
You killed Number Two

262
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:01,237
and confessed it in your
sleep to Roger and Dodger

263
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:04,040
after a hot night of letting
them Eiffel Tower you.

264
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:06,442
And once you knew that they both knew,

265
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,943
you realized you'd have to kill them!

266
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:09,412
Oh.

267
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,580
Oh, I see where this is going.

268
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,482
You're gonna try and pin
all of these murders on me

269
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,051
so I spend the rest
of my life in prison.

270
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:17,286
Oh, no, my friend.

271
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:19,889
You... are going to the electric chair.

272
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:22,458
No!

273
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,627
Do they still use those?

274
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:26,262
Uh-huh.

275
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,296
Okay.

276
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:30,299
Well, thank you for letting me know.

277
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,068
Well, well, well.

278
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:33,836
This just in.

279
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:37,073
Police Chief Denise
Hemphill just got a call.

280
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,809
A decomposing male body was found

281
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:43,579
with rippling abs and
a possible gay face

282
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:48,484
that appears to be a match
for one Boone Clemens.

283
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:51,887
That's right, y'all! Hot damn, shazam!

284
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,889
Boone is dead.

285
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:56,459
Excuse me for a second
while I drop the mic.

286
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:59,829
We already knew Boone was dead.
Pete admitted to killing him.

287
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:01,731
Okay, well, excuse me

288
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:03,933
for trying to reiterate the facts

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,801
and get us all on the same page.

290
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:09,638
I mean, after all, I am just the chief
of the whole damn police department.

291
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:11,640
Okay, look, this is all so insane.

292
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,910
Look, we can all freely admit
that Number Five is fairly odd,

293
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,312
but she is not the killer.

294
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,480
The killer is Hester.

295
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,648
Yes, and the proof is in her files.

296
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,117
(door closes)

297
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,489
The only proof you need
is this hole in my head.

298
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:29,058
Good news.

299
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:33,129
Chanel #5 didn't insert the heel hard
enough to pierce my orbital socket.

300
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,563
The doctors were able
to save my eyeball,

301
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:36,532
and they said that I'm gonna
make a full recovery.

302
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,734
No, that can't be true.
You're the killer!

303
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,637
Your entire life story
is totally fabricated.

304
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:45,574
Just look at her insane, obviously
made-up, high school transcript.

305
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:47,376
I'm very embarrassed about that.

306
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:50,379
Yes, it's true, I falsified
my high school transcripts,

307
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:53,215
but only to cover up the fact
that I was homeschooled.

308
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,583
- (gasps)
- Mm.

309
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:56,018
I-I was afraid that
if people found out,

310
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,520
they wouldn't ask me
to join a sorority.

311
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,989
Liar! You are the baby in the bathtub.

312
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,624
You look just like Boone.

313
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:05,161
And Pete told us that your DNA
matched Boone and my dad.

314
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:08,564
Are you talking about the same Pete who
admitted to being one of the killers?

315
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:10,065
He's just making that all up

316
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:13,369
to cover for his real partner
in crime, Chanel #5!

317
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:14,403
No.

318
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:16,405
Well, then how do you explain the fact

319
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:19,809
that there's absolutely no records
on your parents anywhere?

320
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,010
- (doorbell rings)
- CHANEL: Ugh!

321
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,379
I think the answer to
that is at the door.

322
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,250
What?

323
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:29,852
(dog whimpers)

324
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,754
- Sweetheart.
- Hester?

325
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,522
Oh, sweetheart, are you okay?

326
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,790
Stepfather.

327
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:36,258
We came as soon as we heard.

328
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,594
HESTER: Oh, Mother. Cuddlebear.

329
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:41,797
Everyone, these are my
parents, Clark and Delight.

330
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:45,901
Hester is our biological daughter.
She definitely was not adopted.

331
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:47,803
(chuckles): I have the
stretch marks to prove it.

332
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:50,239
That's right, we're
prepared to corroborate

333
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,808
everything my stepdaughter,
Hester, has just said.

334
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,410
Do I know you?

335
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:58,147
Wait, hold on, there's no record
of Hester's parents anywhere.

336
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:01,884
That's because, until recently, my
husband and I worked for the CIA.

337
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,886
We were forced to
remain deep undercover

338
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:07,523
to protect Hester and Cuddlebear
and the people who love them.

339
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,091
Wait, I do know! I know
where I know you from.

340
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,693
You're from that prostate commercial.

341
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,628
Can you say that line I love so much?

342
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:14,396
Uh...

343
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,899
"Thanks, MaxFlow, my stream's
never been stronger."

344
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,434
"Never been stronger," yes!
I love that line!

345
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:21,437
Well, in order to not blow
their super-secret CIA covers,

346
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:23,873
my parents sometimes work
as actors in commercials.

347
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,007
Oh, yeah, yeah.

348
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,475
Well, I want to talk to my parents,

349
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:29,078
so they can explain to you how
I am not a serial killer,

350
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,546
nor am I the baby in the bathtub.

351
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:33,315
Don't worry, I already
called your parents.

352
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:34,517
(doorbell rings)

353
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,452
CHANEL: Ugh!

354
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:39,188
Wha...?

355
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:42,591
CHANEL #5: (gasps) Mom and Dad!

356
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,094
Hi!

357
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,664
Can you please tell everybody
how I wasn't adopted,

358
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:50,833
nor am I a serial killer?

359
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:54,303
So, we're not Chanel #5's real parents.

360
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,138
A woman named Gigi gave her to us

361
00:13:56,206 --> 00:13:58,307
after a sizable stint in
a mental institution.

362
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,241
What?!

363
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,544
We took her in out of the
kindness of our hearts.

364
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:02,945
And also for the tax deduction.

365
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,614
That's not true!

366
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,616
All Gigi asked was that
when the time came

367
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,919
that we enroll our daughter
at Wallace University

368
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:11,921
and encourage her to
pledge Kappa Kappa Tau.

369
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:13,923
We tried to love her like our own,

370
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,026
but, I mean... she's not great.

371
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,261
And now that the truth is out
that she's probably a murderer,

372
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:20,829
we don't want to have
anything to do with her.

373
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,431
No!

374
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,600
How could you do this to me?!

375
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,469
_

376
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:28,504
I have to be honest, we've
actually discussed doing

377
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,472
exactly what you're proposing.

378
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,775
As soon as she learned to
talk, I wanted to disown her.

379
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:36,445
I mean, maybe she's the killer
on campus, maybe she's not,

380
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,514
- but she probably is, right?
- Yeah.

381
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:39,515
Yeah. I mean, she just sucks.

382
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,549
Our daughter sucks.

383
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:43,586
I can't believe what I'm hearing!

384
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,020
Please tell them the truth.

385
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:46,989
It is the truth, you frumpy monster.

386
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:47,756
(gasps)

387
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:50,192
The psychologists said you probably
wouldn't remember the asylum

388
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,594
on account of it being so traumatic.

389
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:54,597
Your mind filled in the
gaps with imagined memories

390
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:57,499
- of growing up in our house.
- But, sweetie, you're toxic,

391
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,368
and you're bumming us out,
so it's time for you to go.

392
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:02,004
DENISE: Okay, okay, I
have heard enough.

393
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:05,808
Now, I still believe that
Zayday Williams is the killer.

394
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,509
Okay.

395
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,945
But this, this is real suspicious.

396
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:15,851
So, Chanel #5, you are under arrest.

397
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,152
What?!

398
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,554
You can't arrest me... don't you need,

399
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,055
like, a warrant or
something from a judge?

400
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,490
DENISE: What?!

401
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:25,561
I'm the chief of the police department,
and I can arrest whoever I want.

402
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,062
And, little girl, you,

403
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,832
- you got the right to remain silent.
- (handcuffs click)

404
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,534
And you got some other
rights that come after that,

405
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,736
and I don't know what they are,

406
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:36,038
'cause I don't remember
what I'm supposed to say

407
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:38,407
after "You got the right to
remain silent," but come on!

408
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,541
Wait, I'm not finished.

409
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:42,511
She's not the only killer.

410
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:46,448
You also need to arrest... Chanel #3!

411
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,324
Wait, you think I'm the killer?

412
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,925
I know for a fact that
you're working hand-in-hand

413
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:56,161
with Chanel #5 and her evil
killing brother Boone,

414
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:58,587
and that your first victim
was Deaf Taylor Swift.

415
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,159
What? That's impossible.

416
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,328
When the pledges were buried up
to their necks in the backyard,

417
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,964
I was sipping banana daiquiris
at the White Stallion.

418
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,133
Well, yeah, you came to the
White Stallion with us,

419
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,868
but then you disappeared
as soon as we got there.

420
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,303
Care to elaborate, Number Three?

421
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,704
I can explain.

422
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:16,408
<i>When I got to the bar, I realized
my stomach was really bothering me.</i>

423
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,842
<i>I thought maybe someone had
put something in my drink</i>

424
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,112
<i>because I was tting mad cramps, and
I knew it was gonna be trouble.</i>

425
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,114
<i>I was past needing to go number two.</i>

426
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,183
<i>I needed to go</i> number three.

427
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,352
(gasping)

428
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,288
<i>But the bathrooms at the White
Stallion are freakin' disgusting.</i>

429
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,357
<i>There was no way I was gonna
lay down some pipe in there.</i>

430
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,627
<i>So I went back to Kappa House and I
destroyed the bathroom upstairs.</i>

431
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,561
But I didn't kill anyone.

432
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,963
Hmm, so let me get this straight.

433
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,965
You're accusing someone
here in Kappa House

434
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,968
of putting laxatives in your cocktail?

435
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,135
Messing with somebody's regularity?

436
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,304
That's downright criminal.

437
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,306
I just don't understand how
deep the hole's supposed to be.

438
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,309
Whore deep! What kind
of a question is that?!

439
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,310
(sighs)

440
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,245
Useless.

441
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,747
HESTER: <i>Hmm, but let's say</i>

442
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,382
you aren't lying and that you didn't

443
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,117
mow Deaf Taylor Swift's head off.

444
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,021
I know for a fact that you
killed Predatory Lez.

445
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:03,664
No, I didn't.

446
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,415
You know, when you sent
her down there to die

447
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,126
because you were too ashamed
of your feelings for her,

448
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,794
I went down there to check on her,

449
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,397
when I caught a glimpse of
someone running up the stairs,

450
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,599
and they were wearing earmuffs!

451
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,468
- You're lying!
- That's just what I saw.

452
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
Well, just saying you saw
something isn't evidence.

453
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,972
No, you right, it's not evidence.

454
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,607
But it is suspicious.

455
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,009
You know why?

456
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,011
'Cause you the only one
in here wearing earmuffs!

457
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,746
Yeah, I know.

458
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,017
HESTER: Let's not forget the
most suspicious fact of all.

459
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,318
You're Charles Manson's daughter.

460
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,919
Uh, say what, now?!

461
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,622
And you have a shoebox
full of letters from him

462
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,992
giving you advice on how
to kill your friends.

463
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,494
Wait, Number Three, is that true?

464
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,995
I can explain.

465
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,298
Yes, I've become pen pals with my
biological father, Charles Manson.

466
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,200
I wanted my real dad to help me

467
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,202
with some growing-up stuff,
like how to French-kiss a boy

468
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,139
or how to know when I've met Mr.
or Miss Right.

469
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,174
But when he writes back,
his advice is always,

470
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,009
"Maybe you should murder some
of your sorority sisters."

471
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,344
HESTER: Why don't you go
ahead and read us one?

472
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,678
Mm-hmm.

473
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,080
"Precious daughter,

474
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,616
"I'm sorry I don't know anything
about yeast infections,

475
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,117
"but I did see an incredible
story on the news

476
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,253
about, uh, a pizza guy who
had a bomb strapped to him."

477
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,421
What?

478
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,989
"I'm totes sad that I can't order

479
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,024
"a pizza to the penitentiary and
strap a bomb to the pizza guy,

480
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,293
but that doesn't mean y-you can't."

481
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,664
Oh, man. That's real suspicious.

482
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,099
I-I'm telling you, I
didn't kill anybody.

483
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,467
Well, maybe <i>you</i> didn't,

484
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,035
but your split personality did.

485
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,638
I have a signed letter here
from your psychiatrist.

486
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,039
I've never been to a psychiatrist.

487
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,808
Well, your split personality has.

488
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,009
It says right here.

489
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,410
"Dear Hester,

490
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,848
"yes, I treated Chanel #3 for
split personality disorder

491
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,017
"over the course of about eight months.

492
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,653
"She showed up at my office
in a leather jacket,

493
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,155
"claiming her name was Dirty Helen

494
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,824
"and that she was the leader

495
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,226
- "of a notorious West Coast biker gang.
- (gasps)

496
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,395
"Dirty Helen made threats
against my family,

497
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,632
"and I was forced to move my
practice out of the country.

498
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,135
Signed, Dr. Adam Berkel, MD."

499
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:58,937
Oh, my God, so you're saying

500
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,139
that Dirty Helen could have
killed Sam and Deaf Taylor Swift

501
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,975
and I would have no memory of killing
them or receiving treatment?

502
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,543
That's exactly how a
split personality works.

503
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,546
Chanel #5 admitted to you that
she was the baby in the bathtub,

504
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,083
and then she convinced your split
personality to join her on a killing spree.

505
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,086
So, Dirty Helen, I'm the
other baby in the bathtub,

506
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,222
and I want you to join
my killing spree.

507
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,091
Okay, cool. But let's
not tell Chanel #3.

508
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,193
CHANEL #5: <i>This conversation
</i> never took place!

509
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,429
Yeah, but if it did,
I wouldn't remember

510
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,165
'cause you were talking to my evil
split personality, Dirty Helen.

511
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,368
Okay, Chanel #3, you are under arrest.

512
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,504
CHANEL #3: Sam, wherever you are,

513
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,406
I'm so sorry my split
personality murdered you!

514
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,741
- (handcuffs click)
- Wait!

515
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,110
There's someone else you
need to arrest, too.

516
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,079
Chanel Oberlin!

517
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:46,887
- What?
- Excuse me.

518
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,856
Uh, if you're gonna just
continue to accuse everyone,

519
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,057
could we at least sit down?

520
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,293
Liam, we're gonna lose our reservation.

521
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,295
Uh, it's all really interesting though.

522
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,297
I have proof that you, Chanel Oberlin,

523
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,699
entered a home improvement
store two months ago

524
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,701
and purchased the following items...

525
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,103
<i>A garden shear, a riding
mower, three chain saws,</i>

526
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:07,707
<i>a pneumatic nail gun, two
axes, and a crossbow.</i>

527
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,709
Okay, first of all,

528
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:11,711
I was the one who was
shot with the crossbow!

529
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,547
And also they don't sell crossbows
at home improvement centers!

530
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,917
Oh, Chanel, the security
footage begs to differ.

531
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,824
<i>It's also stated right here,</i>

532
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,328
<i>in your Diners Club monthly statement.</i>

533
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,696
I'll take that, too.

534
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,030
What?!

535
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,765
I don't have a Diners Club card!

536
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,068
Is Diners Club still even a thing?

537
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:38,071
- I still keep one in my wallet for backup.
- Mm.

538
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:41,107
I don't know why I'm the one who
always has to bring this up,

539
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,877
but we did all watch Chanel burn Ms.
Bean's face off.

540
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,115
For the <i>last</i> time,

541
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,250
that was a Hell Week prank gone wrong!

542
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,986
I didn't know the oil was boiling!

543
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,253
Someone turned on that deep fryer!

544
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,357
(deep fryer whirring)

545
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:01,894
- I don't know.
- CHANEL #3: And I did just

546
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,363
watch you try to murder Melanie Dorkus

547
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,731
with a pair of scissors
earlier this afternoon.

548
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,701
I only did that because I
thought she was the killer!

549
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,737
I mean, I'm telling you,
I'm not the Red Devil!

550
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:15,608
You bitch. What is your game here?

551
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,910
I mean, I'm all for Number
Five being the killer.

552
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:22,615
She's a weird psychopath who would look
like Boone's homely, bloated sister

553
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,917
if she let her horrible
black roots grow out.

554
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,753
She probably <i>is</i> the
baby in the bathtub.

555
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,823
And I am 100% not
surprised that Chanel #3

556
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,291
is also a psycho with
a split personality,

557
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,561
who is helping Number
Five murder everybody!

558
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,664
But why me?! I mean, I am a
pillar of this community.

559
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,933
I'm also already hot and rich.

560
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,769
What would I have to
gain by hatching a plan

561
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,904
to knock off a bunch of
nameless dumb whores?

562
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,939
I don't think that you did
hatch the plan, Chanel.

563
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,308
But I think that once the
murders started happening,

564
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,711
you saw it as the perfect
opportunity to knock off

565
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,147
the pledges that you thought
would ruin Kappa Kappa Tau.

566
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,250
With each murdered pledge,
this sorority house

567
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,554
got closer to being the Kappa Tau
that you always intended it to be!

568
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:02,789
Oh, yeah?

569
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:06,125
Well, then why didn't I kill the
two pledges I actually hate...

570
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,927
dumb-ass Grace and stupid Zayday?

571
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,063
Plausible deniability!
You knew by keeping

572
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,799
these two alive that it would
keep everyone off your scent.

573
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,900
No!

574
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,768
Come on, Cyclops.

575
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,472
In the sleuthing business, that's
what we call ice-cold logic.

576
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,909
It's obvious when you
look at it, Chanel,

577
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,378
that everything that's
happened on this campus so far

578
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:28,781
is just the logical next step
for sororities everywhere.

579
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,285
Because what's murder if not the most
perfect, ultimate form of hazing?

580
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:36,022
What better way for you to knock
off everyone that you hate,

581
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,157
because they're different
from you or not as popular

582
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:41,360
or not as pretty, than to
murder them one by one?!

583
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:43,863
(Chanels gasping)

584
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,234
Congratulations, Chanel.

585
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,805

book and became a media sensation.</i>

690
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,695
<i>I was on the cover of Time, Newsweek</i>

691
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:29,730
<i>and</i> Men's Health.

692
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,499
<i>Well, I didn't write it.</i>

693
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,167
<i>I had a ghostwriter do it.</i>

694
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,535
Okay, well, there you go.

695
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:38,339
Dean Munsch, your book is
an absolute revelation.

696
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,608
Is there any way you could
sum up your philosophy

697
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,744
on new new feminism
in just a few words?

698
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,713
Um...

699
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:49,717
if feminism was about demanding
equal treatment for women,

700
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:52,153
and new feminism was saying

701
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,823
that men and women are integral
complements to one another,

702
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:59,727
then I guess we could sum
up, uh, new new feminism

703
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:02,863
really in three simple words...

704
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,232
Women are better.

705
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,233
(laughter)

706
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,170
I mean, the proof... it's
right in front of us.

707
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:11,605
If you think about all
of human history,

708
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,742
add up the wars and the genocide,

709
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,278
all the oppression, the
violence, the exploitation,

710
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:21,615
the degradation of the human spirit,

711
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:24,085
what do all those
things have in common?

712
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:27,054
Dudes.

713
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,056
They have dudes in common, right?

714
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,157
Yeah.

715
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:35,296
So maybe, just maybe, it's not just
places like Wallace University

716
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:37,565
that are better off
with a woman in charge.

717
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,402
Maybe we'd be better off
if a woman was charge...

718
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,470
ALL: Everywhere!

719
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,171
Exactly!

720
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,574
(whooping, cheering)

721
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,077
Thank you. Thank you.

722
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:55,049
<i>The culture at this university
has been changed for the better.</i>

723
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:57,384
<i>It's true, a lot of people had to die</i>

724
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:01,055
<i>to make that happen, but I
often catch myself thinking,</i>

725
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:04,258
<i>"You know what? Maybe it was worth it."</i>

726
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:10,134
_

727
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,434
Girls, I am thrilled

728
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,835
that you've taken the initiative

729
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,505
to do the upkeep for our new memorial.

730
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:20,007
Well, we decided it was
the least Kappa could do.

731
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:22,643
Considering Kappa is kind of
the reason they're all dead.

732
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,011
Isn't it so beautiful?

733
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,513
And so nice of the Radwells

734
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,648
to donate the money to commission it

735
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:29,183
and have it built so quickly?

736
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:33,988
Yeah, I'm-I'm not sure I'm
fully committed to the design.

737
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:37,525
Oh, and I should've never let
Chad write the inscription.

738
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:40,528
But I suppose money still talks.

739
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,897
Yeah, well, we've got to get going

740
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:45,299
because I am planning a
"get your yummies in

741
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,800
and your feelings out" baking
party at the house tonight.

742
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,502
We're gonna make cookies and brownies,

743
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,804
and eat them while we
talk about our feelings.

744
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,674
Hester, you think you can
finish up the rest of this?

745
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:55,075
Make sure my boy Earl
gets some extra love.

746
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,144
Yeah.

747
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:01,749
- Well, that just sounds awful.
- I don't know.

748
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:03,551
I for one prefer the
saccharine banality of life

749
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:05,719
under Grace and Zayday
to the toxic sludge

750
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:09,190
the Chanels force-fed us every
day like we were pÃ¢téd geese.

751
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,125
Yeah, I suppose I agree.

752
00:30:11,193 --> 00:30:14,929
But what happened here to those
poor kids and the others was...

753
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,931
was truly awful.

754
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:18,632
I mean, it was an American tragedy.

755
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,970
At least some good came
out of all of that evil.

756
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,605
Oh, more than some, Dean.

757
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:27,741
I-I read your best-selling <i>New
York Times</i> book three times.

758
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,744
Th-These kids were martyrs
for a much bigger cause.

759
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,819
I know it was you, Hester.

760
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,588
I remember that little girl's face

761
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:42,256
in the bathroom that night.

762
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,594
Burned into my memory,

763
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,763
like Joe Theismann's injury
and <i>Two Girls One Cup.</i>

764
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:54,468
I remember every detail
of her little face.

765
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:58,138
And I certainly would know what
she would look like all grown up.

766
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,877
It's not my fault that all
of that happened to me.

767
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,879
You see how awesome Wes is.

768
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,481
He would've been my dad.

769
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,118
I would've had a good life.

770
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:12,653
Maybe if I would've had a real dad,

771
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:14,521
my brother wouldn't have
turned into such a douche.

772
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:17,758
Maybe family trips to ski in
Innsbruck or to Williamstown to see

773
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:19,960
Tim Daly in <i>Death of a
Salesman would've turned me</i>

774
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:22,596
into a much more sane young woman.

775
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:24,098
But that didn't happen.

776
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:25,599
And I can't be blamed

777
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,768
for the painful circumstances
of my upbringing.

778
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:30,104
No, but those kids died.

779
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:33,507
They're dead. And that is your fault.

780
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,209
I didn't kill any of these kids.

781
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:37,478
Except for Pete, but he's a
killer, so that's allowed.

782
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:39,113
By the state, Hester.

783
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:42,750
After a trial and lengthy appeals

784
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,019
and using drugs that
are mostly painless.

785
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:46,987
It all worked out, Dean.

786
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,522
And I'm never gonna kill again.

787
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,024
As long as I'm not texting and driving.

788
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,360
Everyone got what they wanted.

789
00:31:53,803 --> 00:31:56,630
And even if the Chanels didn't
actually kill any of these people,

790
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:58,866
they perpetuated the
system that created me

791
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,869
and my brother, Pete and Gigi.

792
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:05,105
So if anyone should pay for
this, it should be them.

793
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,608
I also have a conscience,

794
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,545
and a responsibility to
all those dead kids,

795
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:15,482
that their killer be
brought to justice.

796
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,186
So I am gonna turn you in, Hester.

797
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:23,557
Then I'm gonna turn you in,

798
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,560
for covering up the murder of my mother

799
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,929
and killing your ex-husband.

800
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:33,934
(whispers): Or we could
just say we're good...

801
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,169
and move on.

802
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:40,941
To our very happy and successful

803
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,077
best-selling lives.

804
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,345
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

805
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:53,821
- Take care.
- You, too. See ya.

806
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,888
This is the "Sophia Doyle

807
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:06,724
I Just Had a Baby and Don't Know
What to Do" hotline center.

808
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:09,727
Now, any girl in the situation
that Sophia found herself in

809
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,929
in that bathtub 20 years
ago has a lifeline.

810
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:13,398
Someone she can call for help.

811
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:16,067
I mean, of course, the girls who
find her can also call as well.

812
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:17,502
We just want to make sure

813
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:20,204
that nothing like this ever
happens on campus again.

814
00:33:20,272 --> 00:33:21,506
Yeah.

815
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:24,309
Well, it certainly is specific.

816
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:25,310
Yeah.

817
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:26,878
How's it going so far?

818
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:28,212
Um...

819
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,181
not a lot of activity yet.

820
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,984
- Right.
- Yeah.

821
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,719
Well, you know, with all the changes

822
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:36,888
that you guys have facilitated
all over the campus,

823
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:41,192
maybe the next girl who has surprise twins
at a party won't have to call for help.

824
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,128
Her friends will just now know
not to let her bleed to death,

825
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,997
because it's the right thing to do.

826
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,732
(sighs softly)

827
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,734
Hey.

828
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,836
Um, I'm really proud of you, Gracie.

829
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:55,206
I-I want to give you a present.

830
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:56,674
Something to acknowledge, you know,

831
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:58,142
all the hard work that
you've done this year.

832
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,211
Wait, Dad.

833
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,146
Are you getting me a car?

834
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:04,115
What? No.

835
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:05,216
No.

836
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:06,217
No, what-what...

837
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:07,385
are you out of your mind?

838
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:09,053
No. No. Trust.

839
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:11,456
Trust, Gracie. I-I'm
giving you my trust.

840
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:12,557
Oh.

841
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:15,026
Oh, well, that's cool, too.

842
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,127
Yeah.

843
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:18,463
You know, I-I just, I-I never...

844
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,199
I never actually gave you the
chance to matriculate here.

845
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,401
I mean, as a student,
sure, but not as a woman.

846
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,870
I mean, I was stalking you
outside of the sorority house,

847
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,207
I got a job in the department
so I could keep my eye on you.

848
00:34:29,274 --> 00:34:32,677
And I never really trusted you
to take care of yourself.

849
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:37,215
Well, clearly, I was wrong about that.

850
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:40,351
- So does this mean you're leaving?
- Well, Dean Munsch, um...

851
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:41,619
(laughs)

852
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,254
...Cathy, uh...

853
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:45,189
I can't stop calling her
that, especially because

854
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,291
she likes me to call her
"Dean Munsch" in bed.

855
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,661
Uh, anyway, Cathy and I, we're going
to Napa for a couple of weeks.

856
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,697
We're gonna, we're gonna
suck down some deep cabs,

857
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,700
eat some rich blues and...
well, I don't know,

858
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,069
pretend to make, uh, a lot of babies.

859
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,704
- (chuckles)
- Mm.

860
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:04,509
I think you need your space.
You've earned it.

861
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,310
I love you, Dad.

862
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:11,282
Should we do one of our
counting good-byes?

863
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,418
No, that's just for sad good-byes.

864
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,119
Okay.

865
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:16,287
One, two, three.

866
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:18,623
- One, two, three.
- Dad...

867
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,293
(sighs)

868
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:24,061
BAILIFF: <i>All rise.</i>

869
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,267
Be seated.

870
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,937
JUDGE: Has the jury reached a verdict?

871
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:33,938
We have, Your Honor.

872
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,508
We, the jury, find the defendants...

873
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,444
Objection!

874
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,312
There is no more objections.
The trial is over.

875
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,916
- What? When did that happen?
- You were asleep.

876
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:47,251
Judge Joe Brown, we, the Chanels,

877
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:49,921
hereby declare this trial a farce.

878
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:55,560
I was under the impression that I had the
inalienable right to a jury of my peers.

879
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:56,894
Look at these hippos.

880
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:59,730
These are not my peers.

881
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:02,266
I'm a hot, rich, skinny
chick, which makes me

882
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:05,069
entitled to a jury of
hot, rich, skinny chicks

883
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,337
to see how awesome I am

884
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:10,608
and to see that the three
of us are innocent!

885
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:11,943
Your-Your Honor!

886
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,611
We, the jury,

887
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,983
find that the defendants are
guilty on all 47 counts.

888
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,251
(gallery murmuring)

889
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:21,486

890
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:25,122
(shrieking, gavel pounding)

891
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,190
Order in the court!

892
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:27,291
- Deal with that.
- Order.

893
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,027
This is a travesty, Judge Mathis.

894
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:32,196
This is a kangaroo court.

895
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:35,199
And I am choosing to
ignore this verdict.

896
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,801
What? You can't ignore the verdict.

897
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,069
What verdict?

898
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:39,670
See, this is me ignoring the verdict.

899
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,573
For, like, the millionth time,

900
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:45,009
my dad is super gross rich.

901
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,410
Like, disgusting rich.

902
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:48,980
He'll have me out of prison in no time.

903
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:50,581
Chanel, your parents abandoned you.

904
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:53,184
They legally disowned
you three weeks ago

905
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,020
and filed an amicus brief
with the prosecution,

906
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,623
stating that they think that
you are a serial killer.

907
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,758
They also want to sue you for the time

908
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:02,627
that you drove your Range
Rover into their living room

909
00:37:02,694 --> 00:37:05,096
because you didn't want to walk
all the way up the driveway.

910
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,031
(choked up): It is
such a long driveway.

911
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,468
Don't worry, Ms. Oberlin. You
ladies are not going to prison.

912
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:12,503
Thank you. (Chuckles)

913
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,705
You're going to an asylum.

914
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:15,907
What?!

915
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:17,909
(gallery applauding)

916
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:21,312
You know, you three are
the worst human beings

917
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,247
that I have ever encountered.

918
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:27,385
You have absolutely no regard
for anyone but yourselves.

919
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,053
You're rude, entitled,

920
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,423
narcissistic, racist and insane.

921
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:37,028
You elected to represent yourselves
in a capital murder case,

922
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:40,064
despite lacking even a basic
understanding of the law.

923
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:44,402
And then, you-you mostly slept
through your own trial.

924
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,303
That's crazy.

925
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,040
Your entire defense consisted
of you screaming at the jury

926
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:50,408
that you didn't kill anybody

927
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:52,043
and then threatening to kill them

928
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,311
if they found you guilty.

929
00:37:53,378 --> 00:37:56,347
That is crazy behavior.

930
00:37:56,415 --> 00:37:58,349
Chanel, you're crazy!

931
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,217
Ladies, please stand.

932
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:01,852

933
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,087

938
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:13,264
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting
your real name is Libby Putney.

at the Palmer Asylum for the Insane!
