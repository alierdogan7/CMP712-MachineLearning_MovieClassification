You guys, go ahead.
I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.

I'll be right behind you.

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,513
You wanted your brother.

8
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:28,317
Now you got him.

- Let me go. Let me go.
- You can't go.

12
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:14,713
Let me go.
Philip.

13
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,167
- Stay out of this.
- He's my friend.

14
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,536
It's not up to me anymore.

15
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,389
- The people have spoken.
- What?

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,375
I asked you where
your loyalties lie.

17
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:28,010
<i>You said here.</i>

18
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,979
<i>Well, prove it.</i>

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,214
Prove it to us all.

20

- Brother against brother.
- Crowd: <i>Yeah.</i>

21

Just follow my lead,

Oh, thank God.

77
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,377
Now we got a problem here.
I need you to back up.

78
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,346
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey!

79
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:06,381
- Hey, put it down!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

80
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,150
- Put it down!
- He tried to kill me!

81
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:10,719
- If it wasn't for him--
- He helped us get out of there.

82
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,755
Yeah, right after he beat
the shit out of you.

83
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:15,390
- Hey, we both took our licks, man.
- Jackass.

- Hey, shut up.
- Enough!

85
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:20,462
- Hey, hey, relax!
- Put that down now!

Get that thing out of my face!

( laughs ) Man, look like
you've gone native, brother.

88
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:27,469
No more than you hanging out
with that psycho back there.

89
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,906
Oh, yeah, man.
He is a charmer, I got to tell you that.

90
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:33,842
Been putting the wood
to your girlfriend Andrea.

91
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:36,511
- Big time, baby. ( moans )
- Glenn: <i>What?</i>

92
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:38,580
Andrea's in Woodbury?

93
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,615
Right next to the Governor.

94
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:43,251
I told you to drop that!

95
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:44,920
You know Andrea?

96
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:49,324
Hey, do you know Andrea?

97
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:51,927
Merle:
Yep, she does.

98
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,029
Her and blondie
spent all winter

99
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,264
cuddling up in the forest.

100
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:59,068
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Yeah.

101
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,270
My Nubian queen here
had two pet walkers.

102
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:05,174
No arms, cut off the jaws,

103
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,142
kept them in chains.

104
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,478
- Kind of ironic now that
I think about it. - Shut up, bro.

105
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,681
Hey, man, we snagged them
out of the woods.

106
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,517
Andrea was close to dying.

107
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,419
- Is that why she's with him?
- Merle: <i>Yeah.</i>

108
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,688
Snug as two little bugs.

109
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,490
<i>So what you gonna</i>
<i>do now, Sheriff, huh?</i>

110
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:25,794
- Surrounded by a bunch of liars,
thugs, and cowards. - Shut up!

111
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:29,231
Oh, man, look at this.
Pathetic.

112
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:32,267
- All these guns and no bullets in them.
- Merle, shut up!

113
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:34,336
Shut up yourself!
Bunch of pussies you roll--

114
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,879
Asshole.

116
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:55,824
You can take those stitches out
yourself in a week or so.

00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,392
Thank you.

118
00:08:57,393 --> 00:09:00,963
Pretty nice having
medical training.

119
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,331
It'll only get you so far.

120
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,668

122
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:20,448
How old is the baby?

123
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:22,684
Barely a week.

124
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,159
To be honest, we never thought
we'd see another baby.

125
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,597
Beautiful.

126
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:38,033

127
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:40,035
How are you feeling?

128
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,973
She's not mine.

129
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:47,042
Where's the mother?

130
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,915
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,518
Man, you people have
been through the mill.

132
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,789
Haven't we all?

133
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:04,827
It's only getting
worse out there.

134
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:07,562
Dead are everywhere.

135
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,199
And it's only making the living

136
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,035
less like the living.

137
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,904
You're the only decent folks
we've come across.

138
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:18,473
You've been out there
all this time?

139
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:22,610
Our neighbor Jerry, he was one
of those survivalist nuts.

140
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,246
Everybody on the block
thought he was crazy.

141
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:25,948
Always preparing
for the end of the world.

142
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,083
- Who knew?
- Jerry knew.

143
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:31,286
He had a bunker under
his shed in the backyard.

144
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:34,957
Sasha and I stayed there
until we ran out of supplies.

145
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,260
Allen and Ben were the first
two people we ran into

146
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,229
when we finally crawled
up out of that hole

147
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,231
around Jacksonville.

148
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,866
Used to be a bunch of us.

149
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:46,335
25 at one point.

150
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:51,106
Our camp was overrun
six, seven weeks ago.

she, uh...

153
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:04,052
We'll see that she has
a proper burial.

154
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:07,589
I appreciate you
taking care of us.

155
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,525
For a while, we didn't know
who we were dealing with.

156
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,528
Neither did we.

157
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,597
We've had our problems
with people.

158
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,632
I must be the first
brother in history

159
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,634
to break into prison.
( Hershel chuckles )

160
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:22,704
Makes me the first white boy

Tyreese.

163
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,419
Like I said, we have
a much larger group.

164
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,389
A close-knit group.

165
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:45,093
I wouldn't get
too comfortable here.

166
00:11:46,396 --> 00:11:49,831
We wouldn't be a problem.

167
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:51,833
It's not up to me.

168
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:54,937
Then who?

169
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,707
Please, you can see
what kind of people we are.

- Daryl: It's gotta.
- It'll stir things up.

173
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:18,226
Look, the Governor is probably on
the way to the prison right now.

174
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,395
Merle knows how he thinks
and we could use the muscle.

175
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,230
I'm not having him
at the prison.

176
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,599
Do you really want him sleeping in the
same cell block as Carol or Beth?

177
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,268
- He ain't a rapist.
- Well, his buddy is.

178
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,170
They ain't buddies no more.
Not after last night.

179
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,838
There's no way
Merle's gonna live there

180
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,873
without putting everyone
at each other's throats.

181
00:12:31,874 --> 00:12:33,808
So you're gonna cut Merle loose and
bring the last samurai home with us?

182
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,344
She's not coming back.

183
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,579
She's not in a state
to be on her own.

184
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,582
- She did bring you guys to us.
- And then ditched us.

185
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,385
<i>- At least let my dad stitch her up.</i>
<i>- She's too unpredictable.</i>

186
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:46,121
That's right.
We don't know who she is.

187
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:48,190
But Merle, Merle's blood.

188
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,359
No, Merle is your blood.

189
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
My blood, my family
is standing right here

190
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:54,562
<i>and waiting for us</i>
<i>back at the prison.</i>

191
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,798
And you're part of that family.

192
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:01,269
But he's not.
He's not.

193
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,340
Man, y'all don't know.

194
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,579
Fine.
We'll fend for ourselves.

195
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,415
That's not what I was saying.

196
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,250
No him, no me.

197
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,952
Daryl, you don't
have to do that.

198
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:20,288
It was always Merle
and I before this.

199
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:22,524
- Maggie: <i>Don't.</i>
<i>- Glenn: You serious?</i>

200
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,394
- You're just gonna leave like that?
- You'd do the same thing.

201
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:27,595
What do you want us
to tell Carol?

202
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:29,731
She'll understand.

203
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,705
Say good-bye
to your pop for me.

204
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:39,841
Daryl, are you serious?
Daryl!

205
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,245
Hey. Hey.

206
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:45,280
There's got to be another way.

207
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:49,784
Don't ask me to leave him.

208
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,753
I already did that once.

209
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,893
We started something
last night.

210
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,696
You realize that, huh?

211
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,699
No him, no me.
That's all I can say.

212
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,839
Take care of yourself.

213
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,976
Take care of
lil ass-kicker.

214
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,644
Carl.

215
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,116
He's one tough kid.

216
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,924
Daryl!

217
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,327
Come on, bro.

218
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,178
We patch you up
and then you are gone.

219
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,176
Where'd they say
we could bury her?

220
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,379
Back of the field
near the other graves.

221
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,882
Hey.
Wait a minute.

222
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,384
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

223
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,185
Losing my grip here.

224
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,655
Come on, put her down.

225
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,127
Okay.

226
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,345
Golden opportunity.

227
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,247
For what?

228
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,949
Little kid and a woman.

229
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,220
Ask them for a hand,
get a hold of those weapons.

230
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,724
- What? - We do it quick, they'll
never know what hit them.

231
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,894
- No. Whoa, whoa.
- We're out here to bury Donna.

232
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:04,229
And we will, after.

233
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,499
- Shut up.
- Look at this place.

234
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,333
It's secure.

235
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,770
- These are good people.
- This will be easy.

236
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,773
A little kid, a woman, a girl
and a one-legged old man.

237
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:16,442
Don't forget about the convict.

238
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,677
You gonna smash the
baby's head with a rock?

239
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,079
- What is your problem?
- How about a little common decency?

240
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,382
This isn't what we do.

241
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,485
Allen: You're living
in the past, Ty.

242
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,621
So are you.
This is survival

243
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,255
of the fittest,
plain and simple.

244
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,025
In here we live, out there we die.
<i>( gate opens )</i>

245
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,461
And I am not waiting around
for the rest of their group

246
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,496
to roll in here and throw
us out on our asses.

247
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,466
- Not a chance.
- How do you know that's gonna happen?

248
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,502
Got some tools for you.

249
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,143
It's much appreciated.

250
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,211
Yeah, we'll take it from here.

251
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,049
You don't need no help
with the body?

252
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,418
No, we'll manage.

253
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,987
Let us know if you
need anything else.

254
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,956
Thank you.

255
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,101
<i>( gate shuts )</i>

256
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,326
Get the brakes.

257
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:46,899
( snarling )

258
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,501
I got it.

259
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,503
( grunting )

260
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,330
You didn't kill him.

261
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,003
That's not why we went back.

262
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:27,907
No. That's right.
You went back for Daryl.

263
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:31,410
And now he's gone again
and the Governor is still alive.

264
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,779
- Daryl was the priority.
- I should have been there with you.

265
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,782
- You were in no condition.
- <i>But my girlfriend was?</i>

266
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,352
- Glenn, this isn't about us.
- I should have been there.

267
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,055
Hey, hey, you didn't come back with
us 'cause you could barely walk.

268
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,090
- What about her?
- What about me?

269
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,026
- Do you know what he did to her?!
- Leave it alone!

270
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,662
- Do you know?
- Let's go.

271
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:03,141
After all that effort,
all the risk we took,

272
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,578
Daryl just takes off
with Merle?

273
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,881
Well, he had his reasons.

274
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,850
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that, Rick.

275
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,553
Doesn't change the fact that
we're up to our necks in shit.

276
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,690
You want me to turn the car
around, beg him to come back?

277
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,558
Throw down a welcome mat
for Merle?

278
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,994
This is the hand
we've been dealt!

279
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,964
Let's just get this out
of here and get back.

280
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:28,667
Get some rest.
We can talk it out there.

281
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,637
No, you guys do all the
talking you want. I'm done.

How many injured?

284
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,919
Nine.

285
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,787
Stevens has it covered.

286
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,956
So where is he?

287
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,892
- In his apartment.
- And?

288
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,062
He wouldn't open the door.
Said he was in the middle of something.

289
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,131
It's all going to hell.

Calm down, people.

00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,950
- Back away.
- It's not safe here. We want to leave.

296
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,185
- There's biters out here, lady.
- Let us out.

300
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,596
All right, take them out.

- Everybody calm down.
- We can't stay here anymore.

This place is crazy.
Please, you have to let us go.

304

Karen, you don't want to go out there.
It's too dangerous.

- Put the gun down.

Hey, I don't take
orders from you.

Shoving a gun in their face won't help.

00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:08,826
- Where's Hershel?
- He's in the cell block.

352
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:10,561
Carol:
<i>Where's Daryl?</i>

353
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,064
It's all right.
He's alive.

354
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,935
We ran into his brother.

355
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,572
They went off.

356
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,644
He left?

357
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,317
Daryl left?

358
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,286
He's gone?

359
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,624
Is he coming back?

360
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:51,168
- Hey.
- Gone?

361
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:54,638
And Oscar?

362
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,442
No.

363
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:28,071
<i>( door opens )</i>
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

364
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,442
What the hell was that?

365
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,244
You put a round in a man's head
in front of all those people

366
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:36,346
and just take off?

367
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:38,916
- You have to talk to them.
- Why?

368
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:42,386
They're panicking. They were ready
to charge through those gates.

369
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:44,121
So let 'em.

370
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,324
Those people won't last a day.

371
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,259
Those people have had it easy.

372
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,796
Barbecues and picnics.
That ends now.

373
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:54,231
Don't blame them for
the mess that you created.

374
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:55,900
They're scared.

375
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,035
Well, I'm through
holding their hands.

376
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:01,305
We're at war.
I should have seen that.

377
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:05,443
So why was Daryl here?

378
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:07,511
Was he part of the assault?

379
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,915
Why?
Why would he do that?

380
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,850
He came for his friends.

381
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,985
The other people you know.

382
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:17,087
Glenn and Maggie.

383
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:19,356
Merle scooped them up
on the run.

384
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:22,827
Was holding them to find out
where his brother was.

385
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:28,365
My-- my friends are still alive
and we're shooting at each other?

386
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,934
You're trying to execute them?

387
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,102
Your friends killed
six good people.

388
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:34,371
Crowley, Tim, Gargulio,

389
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:36,674
Eisenberg, Bob Adams.

390
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,375
Haley.

391
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,513
That man out there,
Rich Foster, he makes seven.

392
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,915
So that's what
your friends did.

393
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:48,752
Why didn't you
tell me they were here?

394
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:51,321
You kept that from me
while we were...

395
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:57,628
You're just a visitor here.

396
00:26:57,629 --> 00:26:59,897
Just passing through.

397
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,432
So why should I tell you?

398
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:09,473
Don't do that.

399
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:12,376
Don't drive me out.
Not now.

400
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:13,978
( knocks ) What is it?

401
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,614
The whole town
is out on the street.

402
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,482
It could get ugly again.

403
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,431
Take your sister inside.

404
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,414
Go on.

405
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,821
You came through, like always.

406
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,026
Sounds like we have
a new problem on our hands.

407
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:04,227
- Yeah.
- You get a good look at him?

408
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:10,500
He had Daryl and Merle
pitted against each other.

409
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:14,337
A crowd cheering for them
to fight to the death.

410
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:18,375
What kind of a sick mind
does that?

411
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:21,211
The kind this world creates.

412
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:26,750
What's wrong?
The baby?

413
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:28,786
No, the baby, she's healthy.

414
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:32,189
Eats like a horse,
sleeps like a rock.

415
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,524
So what is it?

416
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,073
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

417
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:11,495
Not exactly
a chatterbox, is he?

418
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:13,430
Be patient.

419
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:16,566
When he's ready,
let me do the talking.

420
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:28,045
She kind of has Lori's eyes.

421
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,280
Don't you think?

422
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:34,051
( crying )

423
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:48,899
<i>( crying continues )</i>

424
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,896
( clamoring )

425
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:10,204
Milton:
Everyone, if I could--

426
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:12,005
if I could have your attention.

427
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:15,409
- Everyone.
- All right, everybody shut up!

428
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,545
Thank you.

429
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:19,847
The biters on the perimeter
have been dispatched.

430
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:22,916
- The fences have been repaired.
- For now.

431
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:25,285
Where's the Governor?
( crowd murmuring )

432
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:28,188
His-- his condition is...

433
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:29,690
<i>unsteady.</i>

434
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,359
The wound he suffered--

435
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,027
- Our friends were killed, man.
- He shot Richard.

436
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:37,698
I mean, we've all suffered.
We want answers.

437
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:40,133
( all shouting )

438
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:43,303
You're right, Karen.
You're right.

439
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:46,574
Every one of us has suffered.

440
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,877
We don't even have
funerals anymore because

441
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:52,380
the death never stops.

442
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,851
<i>We're never gonna be the same.</i>

443
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:58,753
<i>Ever.</i>

444
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,591
So what do we do?

445
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:07,395
We dig deep and we find
the strength to carry on.

446
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:11,298
We work together
and we rebuild.

447
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,801
Not just the fences,

448
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:17,070
the gates, the community,

449
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:19,640
<i>but ourselves.</i>

450
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:21,742
<i>Our hearts, our minds.</i>

451
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:24,378
And years from now, when
they write about this plague

452
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:26,179
in the history books,

453
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,948
<i>they will write about Woodbury.</i>

454
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:29,884
- <i>Yeah, they will.</i>
<i>- Woodbury.</i>

455
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:32,887
We persevered.
( all agreeing )

456
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:40,060
- Yeah.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

457
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,010
( Judith fussing )

458
00:31:57,011 --> 00:32:00,080
You've got a knack for that.

459
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,917
Just trying to do my part.

460
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:06,119
Sophia used to wake
the neighbors.

461
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,956
3:00 AM.
Like clockwork.

462
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,695
Ed stayed at a friend's most
nights till she calmed down.

463
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:20,835
I always wanted a child.

464
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,843
She wouldn't have made it
if Daryl hadn't been here.

465
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,812
He couldn't stand
to lose anyone else.

466
00:32:31,813 --> 00:32:34,014
Sounds like him.

467
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,651
I don't see why
he had to leave.

468
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:39,653
Merle sounds like a jerk.

469
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:44,157
Men like Merle
get into your head.

470
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:48,562
Make you feel like
you deserve the abuse.

471
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:52,132
Even for Daryl?

472
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:57,638
I'm hardly the woman
I was a year ago,

473
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,540
but if Ed walked through
that door right now

474
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,375
breathing and told me
to go with him,

475
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:03,744
I'd like to think
I'd tell him to go to hell.

476
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,448
You would.

477
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,486
It doesn't matter.

478
00:33:15,189 --> 00:33:18,025
We're weak without him.

479
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,528
We'll get through this, too.

480
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,431
Tyreese and his friends
seem capable.

481
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,335
I'm pissed at him for leaving.

482
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:30,871
Don't be.

483
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:34,008
Daryl has his code.

484
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,343
This world needs men like that.

485
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:41,381
( Judith crying ) ( chuckles )

486
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:45,786
Oh. Hello.

487
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:51,592
- There.
- She fits perfect.

488
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:53,093
Yeah.

489
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,596
Wait.
You cozy in there?

490
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:57,598
Yes.

491
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:06,840
You got worked over good.

492
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:10,110
Surprised no bones were broken.

493
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:12,546
It's courtesy
of Daryl's brother.

494
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,399
You two all right?

495
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:41,408
Thanks for looking out for her.

496
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,644
If anything...

497
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:50,084
I'll go check on her.
You need something else?

498
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:54,154
Okay.

499
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:03,097
Same thing goes for you.

500
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:07,034
If anything worse than this
had happened to you...

501
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:12,840
You're like my own son, Glenn.

502
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:30,557
<i>You got something</i>
<i>needs looking at?</i>

503
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,294
Is Glenn all right?

504
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,800
Go see.

505
00:35:57,618 --> 00:36:00,754
You two seem to be
holding something back.

506
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:05,726
You want to tell me
what happened?

507
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,171
I rest easy knowing
you can handle yourself.

508
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:21,942
You've got
your mother's spirit.

509
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,778
And her stubbornness.

510
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:32,452
You hungry?

511
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:35,789
No.

512
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,628
Hey.

513
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,267
Don't disappear on me.

514
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,557
She's out like a light.

515
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:17,493
Must be days since she slept.

516
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:23,032
You look pretty shot yourself.

517
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,001
How long before she can travel?

518
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:26,535
Have to keep an eye on her.

519
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,372
Pretty sure she has
a concussion.

520
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:32,041
Couple of days if she's up.

521
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,820
Whenever Tomas went off,

522
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,991
Oscar always stood up
for me, you know?

523
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:52,061
He was my friend.

524
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,530
He went out fighting.

525
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,968
So what now?

526
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:01,404
You think the Governor
will retaliate?

527
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,706
- Maggie: Yes.
- Glenn: Let him try.

528
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:05,508
Sounds like he's got
a whole town.

529
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,543
We're outnumbered
and outgunned.

530
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,745
We could use
some reinforcements.

531
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:26,396
<i>( door opens )</i>

532
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,375
I'm Tyreese.

533
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:46,549
Sasha, Allen, Ben.

534
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,953
How'd you get in?

535
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,756
Fire damage to the administrative
part of the prison.

536
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:55,491
Wall's down.

537
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,927
That side's completely
overrun with walkers.

538
00:38:57,928 --> 00:38:59,495
How'd you get this far?

539
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:02,898
We didn't.
We lost our friend Donna.

540
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,934
Carl: They were lost
in the gyms.

541
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,836
- You brought them here?
- Hershel: <i>He had no choice.</i>

542
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,510
I'm sorry about your friend.

543
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,946
We know what that's like.

544
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:19,115
Hershel said you could
use some extra hands.

545
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:21,584
We're no stranger to hard work.

546
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:24,720
We'll go out and get our own
food, stay out of your hair.

547
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:27,290
You got a problem with another
group, we'll help with that, too.

548
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,992
Anything to contribute.

549
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:36,599
No.

550
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,335
Sasha:
<i>Please.</i>

551
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,504
It's like "10 Little
Indians" out there.

552
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,906
It's just us now.

553
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,610
No.

554
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,678
Hershel:
<i>Let's talk about this.</i>

555
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,048
- We can't just keep--
- We've been through this.

556
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:56,719
With Tomas, Andrew.
Look what happened.

557
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,389
- Carol: Axel and Oscar weren't like them.
- And where's Oscar now?

558
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:11,400
I can't be responsible.

559
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:15,204
You turn us out,
you are responsible.

560
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,340
Hershel: <i>Rick.</i>

561
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,846
You've done so much for us.

562
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:26,649
I appreciate that.
We all do.

563
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,917
We owe you our lives.

564
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:31,920
We've done everything you asked

565
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,524
without question.

566
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:38,827
And I'm telling you,
you're wrong on this.

567
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:42,331
You've got to start
giving people a chance.

568
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:09,158
( sighs )

569
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:11,227
Yeah.

570
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,710
No, no.

571
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:30,713
No, no, no, no.

572
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:34,917
No.

573
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:38,688
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

574
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:44,893
Why are you here?

575
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:47,530
- What do you want from me?
- Dad?

576
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:50,666
Why are you-- no.

577
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,775
I can't help you.
Get out!

578
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:02,211
- Tyreese: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get-- get out!

579
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:04,447
Tyreese: Hey, come on.
Whoa, it's all good.

580
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,515
Sasha:
What are you doing?

581
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:08,317
Hey, easy, Rick.
There's no need to--

582
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,220
You don't belong here!
Get out! Please!

583
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:13,055
- Relax, brother. Relax.
- Get out! Get out!

584
00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:15,090
Tyreese: <i>We'll leave.</i>
<i>We're going.</i>

585
00:42:15,091 --> 00:42:16,925
Okay? Ain't nobody
got to get shot here.

586
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:18,994
- We're going.
- What are you doing here?!

587
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,164
- Okay, we're going.
- Just go! Go! Go!

588
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,766
Come on, come on.

589
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:44,787
