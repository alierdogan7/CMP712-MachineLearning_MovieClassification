1
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:50,788
- We should have taken the Honda.
- Where would we have put the luggage?

2
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,968
- You're very strong.
- Keep pushing!

3
00:00:57,227 --> 00:01:00,793
This is the last holiday I’m ever going on with you.

4
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,385
Where did you get all those muscles?

5
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:06,497
More, more, more! Don't quit now.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,448
How much further?

7
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,672
It's only a couple of million more miles.

8
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,446
A couple of what?

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,276
A couple of million more miles.

10
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,013
Now right up here we're gonna stop.

11
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:18,253
Keep pushing, don't quit!

12
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,047
Mexico, next time.

13
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,964
- Hawaii is better.
- Yeah.

14
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,134
Hold it, hold it, hold it! That's good.

15
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,779
Now what you gonna do?

16
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,317
I'm gonna try and get us some...

17
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:39,790
- help.
- help.

18
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:48,116
- Come on, let's have a snowball fight!
- Oh no! No!

19
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:49,950
No!

20
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,093
Daddy! Daddy, come on!

21
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,414
Help me, Daddy!

22
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,884
Yes... Do you have the number for emergency road service?

23
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:45,812
Thank you, Stan.

24
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:47,470
lf you want a hand with anything,

25
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,126
just give me a shout, Mr. Russell.

26
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,140
I will, thanks.

27
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,608
Mr. Russell?

28
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:46,408
Daddy!

29
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:49,639
Catch!

30
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:57,618
Mr. Russell...

31
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,189
You know that this piece is going to Seattle too, Estancia?

32
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,788
Yes, sir.

33
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:16,058
Good.

34
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,522
At first, I have to admit I was in shock.

35
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:36,712
I just functioned automatically. I didn't feel anything.

36
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,354
Then one day it hit me:

37
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,433
Joanna and Kathy are gone.

38
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,199
I just kept walking around the apartment, saying over and over
"They're gone, they're gone..."

39
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,092
I guess I was half crazy.

40
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,443
Well, that was four months ago and...

41
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,233
what I've got to do now is start making demands on myself.

42
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,292
Your first class is next Monday.

43
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,660
I’ve set up a meeting for it tomorrow with some of the faculty

44
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:02,020
You'll remember lot of them.

45
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:03,947
Eleven okay for you?

46
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,552
That's fine, Robert, thanks. Thanks for everything you've done.

47
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:07,553
Ah, come on,

48
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,363
everyone's very excited about you being here.

49
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:13,877
A well-known alumnus and distinguished composer like yourself.

50
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:15,759
Says who?

51
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:17,600
Distinguished or not,

52
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:18,909
we're glad you came.

53
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,005
Okay, kids, keep it down.

54
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:26,440
Go to the kitchen and get yourselves some cookies.

55
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,826
By the way, how long are you planning to stay in the hotel.

56
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,731
There's plenty of room for you here, you know.

57
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,186
Oh no, thanks, Eva. I think...

58
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:38,954
I’m gonna find a house... to rent. I’ve got some things coming out.

59
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,946
What I need is a place I can lock myself in and pound away at the piano.

60
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:43,132
A place I can work.

61
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:46,949
I have a friend who works for the Historical Preservation Society.

62
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,569
They have old houses that I'm sure they rent.

63
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,440
- We'll see what she can come up with for you.
- Good.

64
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,825
- Mr. Russell?
- Yes.

65
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,569
Hello I’m Claire Norman.

66
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,712
Why don't you hop in and we'll drive up.

67
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,352
Fine.

68
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:03,673
- When was the house last occupied?
- Let's see... About 12 years ago.

69
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,609
It's been with the Historical Society for the past 12 years.

70
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:11,930
There we go.

71
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:27,252
There were plans at one time to turn it into some kind of a museum.

72
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,948
But I don't know, I guess the house was meant to be lived in.

73
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,272
Why hasn't it been lived in?

74
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:37,898
Well I've only been with the Society for a year now.

75
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:41,578
The impression I get is that they havn't tried very hard with this place.

76
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:44,491
Of course it does need a lot of work.

77
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,817
And there's some pieces here

78
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,083
that are just stored.

79
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,223
You'd have your pick of them.

80
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:53,831
You know, whatever you like.

81
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,339
Kitchen's in here.

82
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:00,809
What does it take to maintain a house of this size?

83
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:06,565
Oh, we have a man who looks after all this places: Mr. Tuttle.

84
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:08,972
And...

85
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,844
this is the music room.

86
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,154
This is really why I thought of you and this house.

87
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:23,444
The piano was left here when the society took over,
just too much trouble to move, really.

88
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,892
It must be in very bad shape.

89
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,267
What are the terms?

90
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,026
Sorry to disturb your composing.

91
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,787
That's alright, Mr Tuttle.

92
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,421
This has already been composed.

93
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:46,257
There's a man at the front... wants to deliver a water-storage tank.

94
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:47,415
Says you called him.

95
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,416
Okay.

96
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,294
Manage to do any writing?

97
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:16,332
Yes, I’m still working on the second movement. Same old problem.

98
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,429
Well, maybe the lectures will help...

99
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,278
Get some new ideas.

100
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,191
It’s my understanding...

101
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,345
that there are...

102
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:47,545
23 students registered...

103
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:53,534
for this series of lectures on advanced musical form.

104
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,679
Now we all know that it’s not raining outside.

105
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:02,107
And unless there's a fire in some other
part of the building we wouldn't know about,

106
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:06,347
there's an awful lot of people here with nothing better to do.

107
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:08,958
However,

108
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:13,309
we'll know more after the second lecture.

109
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:16,965
I’m sure there are many of you

110
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,510
who may recognize this.

111
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:57,623
- It sounds a little bit better with an orchestra than with a piano.
- Oh no, you made it sound fine in class.

112
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,810
John's secret is that he's a natural ham.

113
00:13:59,811 --> 00:14:01,074
Ah, you're going too far.

114
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,960
- lf you can't find your way back ...
- Send out a search party.

115
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:08,497
I'm sorry.

116
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:15,701
Hi!

117
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,186
I'd like you to meet my mother.

118
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:20,157
- How do you do, Mrs. Norman?
- How do you do?

119
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:23,370
This is John Russell. You remember the Chessman House?

120
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:28,071
Oh, oh yes, yes. I’m very pleased to meet you, Mr... Russel.

121
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,172
How are you liking the place?

122
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,126
Fine.

123
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,596
It’s so... large.

124
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:35,555
Ladies and gentlemen,

125
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,890
may I have your attention please?

126
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:42,096
I’d like to introduce Senator Joseph Carmichael

127
00:14:42,096 --> 00:14:43,231
-  and his son:
- My God!

128
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,359
- congressman Eugene Carmichael.
- He's going to make another speech.

129
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:49,856
Oh yeah, hearing this lifelong Republican commenting on a Democrat.

130
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,134
You know how I hate making speeches.

131
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,383
But sometimes, on a very special occasion,

132
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:01,553
like raising money for our magnificent Symphony Orchestra...

133
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:04,195
And weren't they fantastic tonight?

134
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,146
Damn right!

135
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,192
Now I’m just going to get a drink.

136
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,879
I think I'll join you.

137
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:13,995
I'll be right back, mother.

138
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,202
Thank you.

139
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:20,581
Thank you.

140
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,485
Actually, he's on our Board of Directors,

141
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:25,813
at the Historical Preservation Society.

142
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,461
In fact he's become our number one philanthropist.

143
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:31,770
So, you're getting settled in then?

144
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:33,137
- Oh yes.
- Good.

145
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:36,521
There's some things at the Society office that belong to your house.

146
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:38,515
I'll see if I can dig them up for you.

147
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,090
I’m glad you took the house.

148
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,122
Mr. Tuttle?

149
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,176
Mr. Tuttle?

150
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:48,707
Yes, Mr. Russell.

151
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,606
You frightened me.

152
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:56,389
Is anyone else here? Mrs Riss in cleaning today?

153
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:58,028
No, sir. Just me.

154
00:18:59,026 --> 00:18:59,734
Okay.

155
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:40,547
That's lovely.

156
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:42,346
The music.

157
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:44,556
- Hello!
- Hi!

158
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,862
It has the quality of a lullaby.

159
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:49,063
Yes it is, in a certain way.

160
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,038
Well, here we are, as promised.

161
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:55,992
These are some assorted prints that used to hang in the house.

162
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,199
And this...

163
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:03,074
is an old, restored photograph taken from the back of the house.

164
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:04,916
Beautiful.

165
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:11,801
I tried to call you first, but information can't give your number out yet.

166
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,440
That's a beautiful piece.

167
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,314
Did you refinish it?

168
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:18,665
I didn't, no.

169
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,799
That was Kathy's, my daughter.

170
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,773
Well I guess I’d better be off.

171
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,962
I hope you like the prints.

172
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,277
Thank you.

173
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,571
Are you going riding?

174
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:44,902
Yes.

175
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,077
Do you ride?

176
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:31,910
John?

177
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:34,330
What's the matter?

178
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:39,081
I was just thinking about my daughter Kathy.

179
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:43,145
How much she loved horses.

180
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,990
An airlock, somewhere.

181
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:29,470
It was too loud, too rhythmic.

182
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,710
Well, it's starting at least.

183
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:39,223
Why would it happen two mornings in a row,

184
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:41,842
precisely at 6 o'clock?

185
00:23:43,033 --> 00:23:46,601
Why does it go on for about half a minute and then stops dead.
It doesn't make sense.

186
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,111
A furnace is like anything else, Mr Russell.

187
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:52,928
It’s got habits.

188
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:55,675
It’s an old house.

189
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,349
It makes noises.

190
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:21,974
Very good.

191
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:25,722
We're still not together on the off-beats.

192
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:29,084
And Don, you're retarding a little too much...

193
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,883
on the last four bars.

194
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:32,537
Otherwise it was splendid.

195
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:35,929
Good night.

196
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:54,768
What I'm driving at is...

197
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:58,278
Has... anything like this happened in the house before?

198
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,141
If so, to whom, when and...

199
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:02,386
what did they do about it ?

200
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:05,887
Since I’ve been with the Society, the house has been empty.

201
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:07,380
John...

202
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:10,176
You're working very hard.

203
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:12,583
You've been through a terrible emotional strain.

204
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:15,104
- Isn't it possible that you have...
- ...hallucinated. Is that what you're gonna say?

205
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:15,832
Excuse me.

206
00:28:15,832 --> 00:28:16,840
Minnie ?

207
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,983
Claire, there's a call for you. Your mother. Should I tell her you're busy?

208
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:24,314
I'll be right there. Excuse me, John, just for a minute.

209
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,990
You know, there's some questions about your lease, Mr. Russell.

210
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:37,381
What do you mean?

211
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,372
That house shouldn't have been rented.

212
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:43,963
Miss Norman rushed the papers through our attorney's office.

213
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:47,604
She did not use proper channels.

214
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:50,189
Why should anyone object?

215
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:53,964
That house is not fit to live in.

216
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,974
No one has been able to live in it.

217
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,075
It doesn't want people.

218
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:05,683
Then there has been trouble in the house before.

219
00:36:44,263 --> 00:36:45,862
Claire, listen. It’s note for note.

220
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,686
Same tempo and even the same key.

221
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:49,972
What do you think?

222
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:51,986
I don't know.

223
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:54,558
It’s a startling coincidence.

224
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,681
But that melody must have been very popular at one time,

225
00:36:59,681 --> 00:37:01,392
or it wouldn't be on a music box.

226
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:03,649
I agree, but I swear I never heard it

227
00:37:04,114 --> 00:37:06,995
before I played it and recorded it that day you came over.

228
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:08,787
No, there's something!

229
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:10,671
Something.

230
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,934
It’s happened before here. I’m not the first.

231
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:16,269
I went all over the files very carefully.

232
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:19,045
All the way back to 1920.

233
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,356
Nothing out of the ordinary.

234
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,035
Miss Huxley...

235
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:27,140
Minnie's a highly eccentric old woman, but she'd never...

236
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:30,757
She said the house didn't want people. She's mistaken.

237
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,727
Whatever it is... it's trying desperately to communicate.

238
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:36,855
The banging, the water taps,

239
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,430
the broken window panes. All the glass fell outward.

240
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,943
It has to be done from the inside.

241
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,070
Everything that's happened

242
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:44,857
has been designed to get me into that attic room.

243
00:37:46,957 --> 00:37:48,294
I want to see it.

244
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,988
Look at that book on the desk.

245
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:18,232
C.S.B.

246
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:20,264
January 4th

247
00:38:20,474 --> 00:38:22,200
1909.

248
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:25,989
It’s a little child's writing.

249
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:29,540
1909. Who could have lived here then?

250
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:36,004
This is where I found the music box on the mantel.

251
00:38:42,257 --> 00:38:43,416
Look at this wheelchair.

252
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,242
My God!

253
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:51,041
It’s so small.

254
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,086
What was this room?

255
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:35,491
Former residents, William Saracino and family, architect.

256
00:39:36,162 --> 00:39:39,370
Bought the place in 1965, sold it in 1967.

257
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,876
Purchased for the Society of Historical Preservation, November 1967,

258
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:46,306
through a generous grant from the Carmichael Foundation.

259
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:47,714
- That's the senator?
- Yes.

260
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,666
Great philantropist.

261
00:39:49,566 --> 00:39:51,877
Now where is the rest of this file?

262
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:53,438
No previous occupants...

263
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,358
No previous acts listed.

264
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,360
There's nothing here before 1920.

265
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:04,797
Minnie, we're looking for the Chessman House file pre-1920.

266
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:05,946
Do you know where it is?

267
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,779
What is it you want to know?

268
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,738
We're trying to find out who lived in the house in 1909.

269
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,660
A man named Barnard. A doctor.

270
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,164
Did he have any children you know?

271
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:20,881
I believe a son and a daughter.

272
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,199
There was some kind of family tragedy, I think.

273
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,671
He sold the house in 1909.

274
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:29,119
- 1909?
- That's right.

275
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,741
- I'll set it up for you.
- Thanks.

276
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:35,932
It’s all ready to go. And the scanner's on the right.

277
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:36,997
Thank you so much.

278
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:42,746
Let's have a look here.

279
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:46,304
February 9th. These are want ads.

280
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:49,103
Financial page.

281
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,565
Real estate. More want ads.

282
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,962
Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:41:03,554 --> 00:41:06,658
"Cora Barnard, seven-year old, daughter of Dr. Walter Barnard,

284
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,242
"prominent Seattle physician, was struck"

285
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:12,089
"and seriously injured when she ran in front of a passing coal cart"

286
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,483
"outside her Chessman Park home yesterday."

287
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:18,606
"She was hastened to St Margaret's Hospital where her condition remains grave."

288
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:20,182
So forth and so on ...

289
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,149
Cora Bernard...

290
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,080
C.S.B.

291
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:33,241
There.

292
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,920
"Cora Steward Barnard..."

293
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:40,381
"succumbed"

294
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:45,340
"in St Margaret's Hospital to injuries sustained in a February 15th accident."

295
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,875
"She is mourned by her parents"

296
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,140
"Miss Barnard will be interred in the family plot,"

297
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:52,374
"in the Pootfield Cemetary."

298
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,604
There's the doctor...

299
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,528
and his wife.

300
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:01,988
There's the brother, Lloyd.

301
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:12,241
This little girl, Cora,

302
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:15,061
was killed in the street.

303
00:42:17,214 --> 00:42:19,495
It was an accident, almost the same as Kathy.

304
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,471
What is in that house, Claire?

305
00:42:31,486 --> 00:42:33,182
What is it doing? Why is it trying to reach me?

306
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:34,420
John...

307
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,539
Is it because of my daughter?

308
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:40,580
I can't go through all this again.

309
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:42,640
John...

310
00:42:43,415 --> 00:42:45,450
You must get out of that house.

311
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:12,255
Oh, I believe everything you're saying, Mr Russell.

312
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:16,191
The noises, the lights, the teleportation of objects. They're all very familiar.

313
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:17,838
- Fascinating stuff.
- But the point is:

314
00:45:19,277 --> 00:45:21,125
What do I do now? I mean...

315
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:21,877
Ah!

316
00:45:22,297 --> 00:45:23,020
I'll tell you,

317
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:24,367
off the record.

318
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,726
We have coming here

319
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:30,651
many... mediums and spiritualists and so,

320
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,148
and we test them.

321
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:33,095
Now...

322
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,875
99 percent...

323
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,820
utter frauds.

324
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:37,855
But...

325
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:40,109
the one percent...

326
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:42,631
astonishing!

327
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:44,899
A medium...

328
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:12,721
Hello.

329
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:13,737
Mr. Russell?

330
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,201
Yes.

331
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:16,083
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

332
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:16,936
My wife, Leah.

333
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,208
It's just to your left, please.

334
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:25,253
Could we have these... lights off, please?

335
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:47,182
I thought I'd... record what happens. Is that alright?

336
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:48,246
Oh yes, yes, of course.

337
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:54,002
That's fine. Now, Mr. Russell, would you sit there, please?

338
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:54,497
Yes, of course.

339
00:46:54,497 --> 00:46:55,354
And I'll sit here.

340
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:56,850
Thank you.

341
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:51,599
You've suffered a cruel loss, John Russell.

342
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:54,528
You've lost a wife and child.

343
00:47:56,758 --> 00:48:01,406
The presence in this house is reaching out to you through... that loss.

344
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:09,107
The presence is very strong here.

345
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:18,744
It is a child's presence.

346
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,823
A child who is not at peace...

347
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:24,926
who cannot rest.

348
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:30,697
The presence...

349
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:33,026
is with us.

350
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,719
We sense that you are with us.

351
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,195
Will you talk to us?

352
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,082
Will you communicate with us?

353
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:52,108
Will you come through to us?

354
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:57,889
Will you speak...

355
00:48:59,284 --> 00:48:59,940
to us?

356
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:08,598
We are here to help you.

357
00:49:13,538 --> 00:49:14,913
What is your name?

358
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,192
Will you speak to us?

359
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:23,986
Yes.

360
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,696
What is your name?

361
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:32,620
Are you the child Cora?

362
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:38,681
Are you the child killed by the coal cart?

363
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:41,612
No.

364
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:46,891
What is your name?

365
00:49:56,178 --> 00:49:57,335
Joseph.

366
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:01,448
Did you die in this house, Joseph?

367
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:05,457
How did you die?

368
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:13,933
Is there someone here you wish to communicate with?

369
00:50:20,573 --> 00:50:21,396
John.

370
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:24,886
Help.

371
00:50:25,097 --> 00:50:26,081
Help!

372
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:26,888
Help!

373
00:50:28,576 --> 00:50:29,064
Help!

374
00:50:29,523 --> 00:50:30,067
John!

375
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:31,477
Help!

376
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:32,762
Help!!!

377
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:34,435
Help!!!

378
00:50:42,217 --> 00:50:44,657
Mr. Russell, will you sit over here, please?

379
00:50:57,486 --> 00:51:00,134
Will you speak to John?

380
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:07,823
Will you tell us why you are not at rest?

381
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:13,358
Speak to John.

382
00:51:16,398 --> 00:51:18,589
John is with us.

383
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,451
What do you want of John?

384
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:31,999
Why do you feel no peace?

385
00:51:41,246 --> 00:51:44,340
Why do you remain in this house, Joseph?

386
00:51:45,954 --> 00:51:48,161
What is in this house?

387
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:51,992
Speak to John.

388
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:56,660
John is with us.

389
00:51:58,169 --> 00:52:00,008
How did you die?

390
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:04,373
Did you die in this house?

391
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:10,672
Why do you remain in this house, Joseph?

392
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:12,976
How did you die?

393
00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:18,209
Joseph, did you die in this house?

394
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:27,906
"We are here to help you."

395
00:53:33,006 --> 00:53:34,190
"What is your name?"

396
00:53:39,764 --> 00:53:41,851
"...killed by the coal cart?"

397
00:53:43,952 --> 00:53:45,120
<i>No</i>

398
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:45,943
"No."

399
00:53:56,803 --> 00:53:59,850
"Are you the child killed by the coal cart?"

400
00:54:01,407 --> 00:54:02,591
<i>No</i>

401
00:54:03,095 --> 00:54:03,798
"No."

402
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:14,992
"Are you the child killed by the coal cart?"

403
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:17,558
<i>No</i>

404
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,133
"No."

405
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:23,844
"We are here to help you."

406
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,815
"What is your name?"

407
00:54:28,857 --> 00:54:30,450
<i>Joseph.</i>

408
00:54:33,428 --> 00:54:34,963
"What is your name?"

409
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:38,250
<i>Joseph.</i>

410
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,382
"What is your name?"

411
00:54:46,818 --> 00:54:48,358
<i>Joseph.</i>

412
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:52,250
<i>Joseph.</i>

413
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:56,365
<i>Joseph</i>

414
00:54:57,883 --> 00:54:58,819
"Joseph."

415
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:02,473
"Did you die in this house, Joseph?"

416
00:55:02,473 --> 00:55:03,769
<i>House...</i>

417
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:08,622
<i>My room...</i>

418
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:11,891
<i>Can't... walk.</i>

419
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:18,570
"Will you tell us why you are not at rest?"

420
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:21,436
<i>My father...</i>

421
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:24,285
"Joseph, did you die in this house?"

422
00:55:24,285 --> 00:55:25,724
<i>My room...</i>

423
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:27,342
"How did you die?"

424
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:29,625
"How did you die?"

425
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:31,555
How did you die?

426
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:33,963
How did you die?

427
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,188
<i>Father...</i>

428
00:55:36,196 --> 00:55:37,262
<i>Father...</i>

429
00:55:38,576 --> 00:55:39,863
<i>The well...</i>

430
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,312
<i>Sacred Heart.</i>

431
00:55:46,352 --> 00:55:48,144
<i>My medal.</i>

432
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:50,532
<i>Father...</i>

433
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,282
<i>Father, don't.</i>

434
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:55,279
<i>Help!</i>

435
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:41,976
<i>Body...</i>

436
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:43,545
<i>Ranch...</i>

437
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:46,369
<i>The well.</i>

438
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:49,706
<i>My name...</i>

439
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:53,612
<i>Joseph Carmichael.</i>

440
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:01,604
Claire...

441
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:04,325
Yeah.

442
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,044
I’m sorry to...

443
00:58:11,465 --> 00:58:12,145
I just...

444
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,121
Can you co...

445
00:58:23,665 --> 00:58:24,813
<i>Father...</i>

446
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,739
<i>My room...</i>

447
00:58:31,126 --> 00:58:33,008
<i>Can't... walk.</i>

448
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:39,849
"Will you tell us why you are not at rest?"

449
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,482
<i>My father...</i>

450
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,382
"Joseph, did you die in this house?"

451
00:58:45,382 --> 00:58:46,388
<i>My room...</i>

452
00:58:46,388 --> 00:58:48,053
"How did you die?"

453
00:58:49,548 --> 00:58:51,563
<i>Father, don't.</i>

454
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:53,955
<i>My name...</i>

455
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:58,119
<i>Joseph Carmichael.</i>

456
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,943
I shouldn't have called you. It's just that I needed someone.

457
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:28,775
I wrote some words on the paper.

458
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:34,183
I wrote Sacred Heart.

459
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,659
There used to be a county orphanage...

460
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,597
named Sacred Heart.

461
00:59:45,996 --> 00:59:48,093
It was closed down years ago.

462
00:59:50,284 --> 00:59:50,972
An orphanage?

463
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:54,183
Yes.

464
00:59:59,292 --> 01:00:01,484
That child, Joseph Carmichael...

465
01:00:04,008 --> 01:00:06,393
He was murdered in this house, in the attic.

466
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:09,181
And buried.

467
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:12,416
And then an orphan...

468
01:00:13,221 --> 01:00:16,916
Stop it, John! Just move away from this place.

469
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:11,282
Miss Huxley is on the phone, Senator.

470
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:12,988
It's the third time she's called this morning.

471
01:01:12,988 --> 01:01:14,227
She says it's important.

472
01:01:14,398 --> 01:01:15,582
All right, I'll take it.

473
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:29,263
Hello, Minnie, how are you?

474
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:30,768
I'm fine.

475
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:34,371
They've been going through the files.

476
01:01:36,678 --> 01:01:38,213
Let me have that name again.

477
01:01:40,147 --> 01:01:40,995
John...

478
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:44,069
Russell.

479
01:01:46,064 --> 01:01:48,456
I’m very glad to be of help, as you know.

480
01:01:50,628 --> 01:01:51,418
Goodbye.

481
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,640
The senator's campaign bio. 1960.

482
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,528
I got it from the main library and had it xeroxed. It's informing.

483
01:02:43,158 --> 01:02:44,229
You found something?

484
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:50,026
Some kind of a rough retrospective, that somebody drew up
when they were thinking about turning the house into a museum.

485
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:55,095
Richard Carmichael and family occupied the house 1899 to 1906.

486
01:02:55,823 --> 01:02:57,920
Richard was the senator's father.

487
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:00,883
His mother died when he was born in 1900.

488
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:02,438
It's all in there.

489
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,479
Look at the part about his illness.

490
01:03:07,572 --> 01:03:12,491
"Joe Carmichael, his son, age three, was struck on of a form of atrophic arthritis."

491
01:03:12,491 --> 01:03:13,607
Move further down.

492
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:20,067
"It was decided to send little Joe to the famed Nordbach
Sanatorium in Bale, Switzerland for special care."

493
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:24,340
"Accompanied by his father, he embarked for Europe in October 1906."

494
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:29,605
"And not to set foot on American soil again until the cessation of World War I."

495
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,663
You see how it might have been done.

496
01:03:32,907 --> 01:03:34,514
Richard's son, a sick child,

497
01:03:35,134 --> 01:03:37,614
was murdered by his father and buried secretly.

498
01:03:39,626 --> 01:03:41,706
And then they substituted a six-year old orphan

499
01:03:41,706 --> 01:03:44,523
who was put in his place and shipped right overseas right away,

500
01:03:45,046 --> 01:03:45,965
with the father attending.

501
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,550
It all worked for them.

502
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,168
Even the war worked.

503
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:53,585
He kept him in Switzerland till 1918. He came back here, he was 18 years old.

504
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:55,869
Who was gonna know that he wasn't the real son?

505
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:58,827
If he wasn't crippled anymore it was because he was cured.

506
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:00,372
John...

507
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:03,347
Do you think he knows about the murder?

508
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:04,696
And about the replacement?

509
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,075
I don't know.

510
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,869
How could any father do such a thing?

511
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,103
Richard's wife was Emily Spencer.

512
01:04:14,103 --> 01:04:15,801
She was the daughter of H.T. Spencer.

513
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,260
He founded the Spencer-Carmichael empire.

514
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:21,999
He died in... 1905. He was a zillionaire.

515
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,181
His will...

516
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:26,051
His will might be very interesting.

517
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,188
There must be a copy within the holo-write.

518
01:04:29,103 --> 01:04:31,126
I'm also gonna try to find out if there was ranch.

519
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:33,511
A Spencer or a Carmichael ranch, somewhere.

520
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,219
Yeah, a ranch...

521
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:36,640
with a well.

522
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:48,009
This is the 1908 atlas of Seattle which is opened to the
part of the city where the Carmichael ranch was located.

523
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:48,857
Right here.

524
01:04:48,857 --> 01:04:50,304
What does that little mark right there mean?

525
01:04:51,493 --> 01:04:53,430
According to the legend, here,

526
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,989
that was the location of a well on that property.

527
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,797
I see...

528
01:04:56,797 --> 01:04:58,699
And in the 1914 atlas,

529
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:01,518
which is opened here, to the same area,

530
01:05:01,518 --> 01:05:05,383
there's been... one large lot that appears to have been sold off.

531
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:08,989
But the property is very much the same, and the location of the well is still given.

532
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,119
Right... I see.

533
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:13,302
In the 1928 atlas, there's a quite change.

534
01:05:13,302 --> 01:05:15,357
There's further subdivision of the property.

535
01:05:15,357 --> 01:05:18,181
The symbol for the well has disappeared,

536
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:20,182
and a house has been built here.

537
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:17,307
The ranch is listed in the will.

538
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,127
It’s part of the inheritance of little Joseph Carmichael.
All of five years old at the time.

539
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:23,687
He got just about everything.

540
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,835
What about the father, Richard?

541
01:06:26,345 --> 01:06:27,218
Bypassed.

542
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:31,128
Except as his son's guardian and therefore trustee of the estate.

543
01:06:32,009 --> 01:06:36,090
Old man Spencer's daughter was dead,
and obviously he wasn't too fond of his son-in-law.

544
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:38,747
Yes, but wait...

545
01:06:38,747 --> 01:06:40,347
Richard doesn't get any money.

546
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:44,819
But he still controls his son and his son is worth a fortune.

547
01:06:45,263 --> 01:06:46,020
Unless...

548
01:06:47,094 --> 01:06:50,977
Unless for some reason the boy dies before attaining the age of 21.

549
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:54,017
In that case the entire estate goes to charity.

550
01:06:55,486 --> 01:07:00,836
That would have shut Richard out completely.
And there he was with a son who was weak, sickly, bedridden...

551
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:01,820
Couldn't even walk.

552
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,667
He must have decided not to take a chance on the boy.

553
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,567
The money was just too tempting.

554
01:07:29,803 --> 01:07:31,114
What are you going to tell her?

555
01:07:31,575 --> 01:07:33,712
About the well under the house and the body.

556
01:07:34,237 --> 01:07:35,722
And the medal with the name on it?

557
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:37,602
No, and nothing about Carmichael.

558
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:40,172
She'll think you're crazy.

559
01:07:40,634 --> 01:07:42,180
You'll tell her I’m not.

560
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:53,831
Good evening, Mrs. Grey. I’m John Russell. This is Miss Norman.

561
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,015
Mr Russell...

562
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:05,942
I wouldn't have listened to your story for two minutes.

563
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:07,658
I wouldn't have let you in here...

564
01:08:07,868 --> 01:08:10,066
but for something you said on the phone earlier.

565
01:08:10,983 --> 01:08:12,695
You said that this...

566
01:08:13,243 --> 01:08:16,331
seance affair of yours happened three nights ago, right?

567
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:17,179
That's right.

568
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:19,548
Well, three nights ago,

569
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,364
on Monday night,

570
01:08:22,427 --> 01:08:24,132
Linda, my daughter,

571
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:28,870
woke up screaming just after midnight.

572
01:08:29,787 --> 01:08:31,171
She'd had a nightmare.

573
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:34,899
When I went in to her, she was hysterical. She was sobbing.

574
01:08:34,973 --> 01:08:36,869
I’d never seen her like that before.

575
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:40,060
I admit she's had nightmares before, but not ...

576
01:08:43,063 --> 01:08:46,118
She said she'd seen... a boy.

577
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:49,416
Very small, very thin...

578
01:08:50,267 --> 01:08:52,420
Almost gnome-like.

579
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,627
And he was trying to come up through the floor.

580
01:08:57,656 --> 01:08:59,736
And he kept staring at her.

581
01:09:02,386 --> 01:09:04,289
Here, in the middle.

582
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,768
She hasn't been in the room since, or come near. She sleeps with me.

583
01:09:09,803 --> 01:09:11,435
What we want is...

584
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:15,211
What you want, Mr Russell, is to tear this room apart.

585
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:21,669
Well, I have your phone number, Mr Russell. I'll have to think about it.

586
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,334
They're still digging,

587
01:11:44,444 --> 01:11:45,880
but they've found the well.

588
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,579
Okay.

589
01:11:54,357 --> 01:11:55,339
Found anything?

590
01:11:55,339 --> 01:11:59,683
No, nothing yet. This is Tony, Mrs. Grey's son. Miss Norman.

591
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,335
Hi!

592
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,531
Thanks.

593
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:32,812
Get me the flashlight, will you?

594
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:33,521
Sure.

595
01:12:34,766 --> 01:12:35,935
I think I’ve found something.

596
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:38,739
What is it?

597
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:52,978
It’s a hand.

598
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:54,098
What?

599
01:12:57,101 --> 01:12:58,109
It’s a hand.

600
01:13:00,173 --> 01:13:01,366
I'll call the police.

601
01:13:09,744 --> 01:13:10,575
Nothing more?

602
01:13:11,984 --> 01:13:13,087
It doesn't look like it.

603
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:15,420
You think there might be something else coming?

604
01:13:15,787 --> 01:13:16,420
No.

605
01:13:18,104 --> 01:13:21,152
Assistant coroner said those bones have been down there maybe 50 years.

606
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,462
Do you have some idea who that child was?

607
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:24,960
No, not really.

608
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:26,823
What's "not really" mean?

609
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:29,546
No.

610
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,618
I want statements from everybody.

611
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:36,849
Mrs Grey, do you have some other place you could stay for tonight?

612
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:38,026
Yes, it's all been arranged.

613
01:13:38,026 --> 01:13:38,667
Good.

614
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,374
I think you should have told them.

615
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:54,277
It’s got to be there.

616
01:13:54,683 --> 01:13:56,660
Without that medal, there's no evidence. There's nothing.

617
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:57,930
You have the tape.

618
01:13:58,624 --> 01:14:02,503
Tapes can be altered. They know that. You see the expression on his face?

619
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,340
It was obvious you were holding something back.

620
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:11,073
Look, it’s very late. Why don't you get some rest and I'll talk to you in the morning.

621
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:12,962
- Fine. Drive carefully.
- You too.

622
01:17:11,776 --> 01:17:12,648
What's the matter?

623
01:17:19,908 --> 01:17:23,028
St. Paul's Church. September 8th, 1900.

624
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:26,055
Joseph Patrick Carmichael.

625
01:17:26,878 --> 01:17:27,877
It was there?

626
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,430
It was there.

627
01:17:34,305 --> 01:17:38,424
You have to show it to the police.
It’s the only piece of solid evidence we've got.

628
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:42,204
They didn't see me dig it up. They couldn't find it.
Why should they believe it was there?

629
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:44,501
You can't just ignore them.

630
01:17:46,032 --> 01:17:48,864
The police ain't gonna trouble themselves with a 70 years old case.

631
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:51,875
Still, it's an unsolved murder.

632
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:52,423
No.

633
01:17:53,226 --> 01:17:55,407
Whatever has to be done, has to be done by me.

634
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:57,727
I’ve got to get to Carmichael.

635
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:59,839
He won't see you now.

636
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:00,846
He'll see me.

637
01:18:07,661 --> 01:18:08,441
Senator!

638
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:12,430
Hey, hold up!

639
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,037
- Senator!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute now!

640
01:18:15,945 --> 01:18:16,376
Senator!

641
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:17,711
I’m John Russell.

642
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:19,697
I'm living in your house.

643
01:18:20,124 --> 01:18:21,044
Senator, look!

644
01:18:21,836 --> 01:18:22,843
I want to show him that.

645
01:18:23,855 --> 01:18:24,588
Let go!

646
01:18:24,589 --> 01:18:25,551
Senator!

647
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:27,505
It’s a baptism medal.

648
01:18:29,426 --> 01:18:30,704
It's got your name on it.

649
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:32,073
- You've got him?
- We've got him.

650
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:33,388
It was buried with the body...

651
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:36,683
of a little boy.

652
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:38,297
Senator!

653
01:18:38,868 --> 01:18:40,269
The police know about it.

654
01:18:49,888 --> 01:18:51,408
Who was that? Some kind of crackpot?

655
01:18:52,592 --> 01:18:53,830
I have no idea...

656
01:18:55,057 --> 01:18:56,384
Never mind. Come on!

657
01:19:01,597 --> 01:19:02,325
Dale...

658
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:06,401
I want you to radio back to... police headquarters.

659
01:19:07,283 --> 01:19:08,657
Captain DeWitt.

660
01:19:09,686 --> 01:19:11,359
Ask him to call me in Spokane...

661
01:19:12,254 --> 01:19:14,007
- this number.
- Yes, sir.

662
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,304
You goddamn son of a bitch.

663
01:20:06,846 --> 01:20:08,109
What is it you want?

664
01:20:10,353 --> 01:20:12,160
What do you want from me?

665
01:20:13,998 --> 01:20:15,830
I’ve done everything I could do.

666
01:20:19,297 --> 01:20:20,640
There's nothing more to do.

667
01:21:02,721 --> 01:21:03,569
Mr. Russell?

668
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:04,672
Yes.

669
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,084
My name is DeWitt. Captain DeWitt.

670
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:07,884
Oh yeah.

671
01:21:08,873 --> 01:21:10,189
I’d like to talk to you if I may.

672
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:12,357
All right. Come in.

673
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:20,401
Quite a house.

674
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:22,117
Yes.

675
01:21:24,944 --> 01:21:27,743
You're a musician, a composer. Is that right, Mr Russell?

676
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:29,139
Yes.

677
01:21:29,717 --> 01:21:32,494
You teach in a course of the Faculty of Music out of the university?

678
01:21:33,137 --> 01:21:33,892
That's right.

679
01:21:35,612 --> 01:21:38,153
Is this where you held your... seance?

680
01:21:38,824 --> 01:21:40,505
What was it you wanted to talk to me about?

681
01:21:45,343 --> 01:21:50,183
You were out at Boeing airfield this morning, Mr Russell.
They told me you caused quite a scene.

682
01:21:50,228 --> 01:21:52,900
Screaming, yelling, acting like a lunatic.

683
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:58,416
Sgt. Durban tells me you were up to some strange things last night, too.

684
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:03,198
Seems you dug up some bones under a lady's house that...

685
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:06,384
some ghostly voice told you were there. Is that correct?

686
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:10,040
Only Sgt. Durban said you told him you had no idea...

687
01:22:10,839 --> 01:22:13,167
who those bones were. No idea at all.

688
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:14,591
Now it seems...

689
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,515
Well, it seems a little odd then, don't you think,

690
01:22:18,311 --> 01:22:23,628
that you go charging across that airfield this morning,
making crazy accusations against Senator Carmichael.

691
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:24,923
I made no accusation.

692
01:22:23,922 --> 01:22:28,139
- Senator Carmichael who has served this state for 36 years.
- I told you...

693
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:32,026
And who is not about to give in to any dirty little blackmail scheme.

694
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:33,427
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.

695
01:22:33,427 --> 01:22:34,292
What are you talking about?

696
01:22:40,462 --> 01:22:43,269
I understand you lost your wife and daughter a little while ago.

697
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,302
Maybe it shook you up.

698
01:22:45,922 --> 01:22:47,002
Maybe too much.

699
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:48,736
Maybe you need help.

700
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:52,313
I’d like you to leave now.

701
01:22:52,313 --> 01:22:53,537
We can see that you get it.

702
01:22:55,506 --> 01:22:56,601
You understand what I’m saying?

703
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,016
Out. Now.

704
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,102
Listen to me, Russell.

705
01:23:02,531 --> 01:23:04,291
You've got something of the Senator's.

706
01:23:04,922 --> 01:23:05,952
He wants it back.

707
01:23:06,605 --> 01:23:09,333
It’s a little gold medal. A family heirloom. He lost it.

708
01:23:10,998 --> 01:23:12,574
He thinks you've got it.

709
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:16,472
I don't know what you're talking about.

710
01:23:22,424 --> 01:23:26,081
I’m sorry to barge in on you like this, but I am so damn mad!

711
01:23:26,082 --> 01:23:27,082
This mor...

712
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,854
This is... Cpt. DeWitt. He's with the police.

713
01:23:30,854 --> 01:23:33,031
You're... Miss Norman?

714
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:34,952
Yes.

715
01:23:38,274 --> 01:23:42,922
I take it now or I come back in an hour with
a warrant and a crew and we tear this place apart.

716
01:23:43,803 --> 01:23:46,555
Tear this place apart? What's going on here?

717
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:47,587
I'll be here.

718
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:51,526
Suit yourself.

719
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:57,932
Well, what was that all about?

720
01:23:57,933 --> 01:24:00,885
Senator Carmichael thinks he's being blackmailed.

721
01:24:05,472 --> 01:24:07,315
They've cancelled your lease.

722
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:10,217
They've forced me to resign from the Society.

723
01:24:10,682 --> 01:24:14,481
No explanation, no reason, nothing. Just get out.

724
01:24:14,935 --> 01:24:17,246
I've an appointment with the head of the Board of Directors.

725
01:24:17,593 --> 01:24:19,056
I'll see what I can find out.

726
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,707
I'll call you and let you know.

727
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:51,183
Yes?

728
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:53,441
Yes, Claire.

729
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:56,415
I was driving by and I recognized the car.

730
01:25:56,415 --> 01:25:59,457
I don't know how it happened. I don't know how it could've happened.

731
01:25:59,457 --> 01:26:01,551
There were no other car there. Nothing.

732
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:03,959
And it's upside down in the middle of the road.

733
01:26:04,169 --> 01:26:09,415
And that man, that policeman who was just at your house, DeWitt, he's dead!

734
01:26:51,355 --> 01:26:53,082
Carmichael. Any messages?

735
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:57,288
Oh yeah, Cpt. DeWitt. What did he say?

736
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:01,961
What?

737
01:27:05,088 --> 01:27:05,719
Yeah.

738
01:27:10,436 --> 01:27:11,843
Oh my God!

739
01:27:16,036 --> 01:27:16,483
Who?

740
01:27:18,624 --> 01:27:19,471
Russell?

741
01:27:23,494 --> 01:27:24,229
All right.

742
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:28,709
Let me have that number.

743
01:27:45,864 --> 01:27:46,759
John Russell.

744
01:27:46,759 --> 01:27:48,241
The Senator is expecting you.

745
01:28:11,047 --> 01:28:12,742
- Still busy?
- Yes.

746
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:24,409
Where are you going?

747
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:25,971
I'll be back in a little while.

748
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:26,789
Claire!

749
01:28:39,042 --> 01:28:41,297
Alright, just what the hell do you want?

750
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:45,569
You must have some idea, otherwise I wouldn't have got past the door.

751
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:48,230
I’m a busy man. Make it fast.

752
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:54,718
The house on Chessman Park.

753
01:28:56,029 --> 01:28:58,439
Your family lived there until 1906.

754
01:29:01,092 --> 01:29:02,667
It’s had a history of...

755
01:29:03,348 --> 01:29:04,805
strange happenings.

756
01:29:05,686 --> 01:29:08,518
There's something... in that house, a manifestation.

757
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:13,003
This afternoon, Cpt. DeWitt came to see me,

758
01:29:13,396 --> 01:29:14,756
presumably on your behalf.

759
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,975
So, you must have learned what's happened.

760
01:29:17,975 --> 01:29:19,704
At least as much as DeWitt could tell you.

761
01:29:21,234 --> 01:29:24,402
The... disturbances, the seance, the bones...

762
01:29:25,377 --> 01:29:26,761
found in the well.

763
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:30,844
I tried to talk to you at the airport.

764
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:34,033
I showed you this.

765
01:29:39,016 --> 01:29:40,471
DeWitt said you'd lost it.

766
01:29:44,286 --> 01:29:45,773
I found it in a grave...

767
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:48,211
where the child was buried.

768
01:29:52,965 --> 01:29:56,459
There's no... logical explanation for what I’m going to say to you now.

769
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:00,072
The boy was badly crippled.

770
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,331
I believe he was killed...

771
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,796
in an attic room of that house.

772
01:30:08,726 --> 01:30:09,869
I...

773
01:30:12,155 --> 01:30:13,588
I saw what happened.

774
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:19,529
And I believe it was Richard Carmichael, your father,

775
01:30:22,169 --> 01:30:24,209
who murdered the boy, his natural son...

776
01:30:24,742 --> 01:30:26,027
Joseph Carmichael.

777
01:30:28,734 --> 01:30:31,814
There was a... substitution from the Sacred Heart orphanage,

778
01:30:32,497 --> 01:30:33,710
the boy was taken to Europe,

779
01:30:34,885 --> 01:30:37,300
cured, miraculously, and returned...

780
01:30:38,304 --> 01:30:39,651
to inherit an empire.

781
01:30:41,682 --> 01:30:43,389
That changeling was you.

782
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:58,402
So...

783
01:30:59,438 --> 01:31:00,698
That's your story?

784
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:02,818
Whatever you want to call it.

785
01:31:08,153 --> 01:31:08,833
How much?

786
01:31:09,785 --> 01:31:10,817
My God!

787
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:14,849
Alright, how much do you want for this farce that you've concocted?

788
01:31:15,407 --> 01:31:17,080
This isn't blackmail.

789
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,520
I’ve been dealing with vermin like you for years.

790
01:31:20,197 --> 01:31:21,541
You waste your chance...

791
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:26,157
- then you come up with a story that's so pathetically incredible...
- It truly terrifies you, doesn't it?

792
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:29,339
- It’s the truth. It won't be buried.
- Get out!

793
01:31:29,591 --> 01:31:31,684
None of this belongs to you!

794
01:31:31,643 --> 01:31:34,378
Get out of here! With your filthy lies!

795
01:31:34,378 --> 01:31:37,996
It should've gone to that dead child.
You suspected something was wrong all your life.

796
01:31:37,996 --> 01:31:39,692
You're not Joseph Carmichael.

797
01:31:40,144 --> 01:31:42,489
You're the beneficiary of the cruelest kind of murder.

798
01:31:42,489 --> 01:31:44,660
- Murder for profit.
- No!

799
01:31:47,413 --> 01:31:49,597
My father was not a murderer.

800
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:53,421
Nobody in this world can say that.

801
01:31:56,478 --> 01:31:57,982
My father was a great man.

802
01:31:59,482 --> 01:32:00,773
He was a loving man.

803
01:32:02,759 --> 01:32:03,999
And for you to...

804
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:06,872
to come in here and accuse him of...

805
01:32:10,971 --> 01:32:12,140
... of killing.

806
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:17,441
Damn you!

807
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,049
I will not allow you to slander his good name.

808
01:32:34,746 --> 01:32:37,523
These documents are on file... in the city.

809
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,951
This is a tape of the seance.

810
01:32:44,144 --> 01:32:45,256
There's no copy.

811
01:32:47,444 --> 01:32:49,187
Take it. I’ve done what I had to do.

812
01:32:56,359 --> 01:32:57,447
I’m sorry.

813
01:32:59,943 --> 01:33:00,646
Russell...

814
01:33:02,513 --> 01:33:05,346
lf I find that you've breathed one word of this...

815
01:33:06,262 --> 01:33:07,246
One word...

816
01:33:07,925 --> 01:33:08,913
To anyone ...

817
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:13,182
You'll wish you'd never come into this world.

818
01:33:36,376 --> 01:33:37,536
What was that shouting about?

819
01:33:38,641 --> 01:33:39,560
Nothing.

820
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:42,577
Get out!

821
01:33:43,364 --> 01:33:44,514
Leave me alone.

822
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:31,218
John?

823
01:34:32,843 --> 01:34:33,674
I tried to ca...

824
01:34:42,392 --> 01:34:43,181
John?

825
01:34:47,564 --> 01:34:48,328
John?

826
01:34:48,328 --> 01:34:49,632
Where are you?

827
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:03,881
Claire!

828
01:35:05,482 --> 01:35:07,339
John, what are you doing?

829
01:35:10,069 --> 01:35:10,510
John?

830
01:35:24,602 --> 01:35:25,247
Claire!

831
01:35:50,008 --> 01:35:50,784
John?

832
01:35:52,514 --> 01:35:53,491
please...

833
01:35:53,983 --> 01:35:55,661
I don't want to come up there.

834
01:35:55,954 --> 01:35:56,786
Claire?

835
01:35:58,785 --> 01:35:59,652
John?

836
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:14,183
John?

837
01:36:51,484 --> 01:36:54,971
I thought that you... Oh God! I thought you were here.

838
01:37:04,554 --> 01:37:08,433
l thought you were here. l didn't know you were going out.

839
01:37:10,078 --> 01:37:11,454
You're OK now. Come on.

840
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:13,019
Just wait in the car.

841
01:37:13,743 --> 01:37:15,364
Oh no! You're not going back in there!

842
01:37:15,368 --> 01:37:17,365
- No please, please! Don't!
- Claire!

843
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:20,270
Claire! You're safe now. Just wait in the car.

844
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:22,106
I'll be right back. Don't worry.

845
01:37:26,315 --> 01:37:27,003
Joseph!

846
01:37:27,695 --> 01:37:28,446
No!

847
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,566
<i>Father...</i>

848
01:39:12,433 --> 01:39:14,096
<i>My medal...</i>

849
01:39:14,669 --> 01:39:16,357
<i>My medal...</i>

<i>My medal!</i>

854

John!

855
01:40:21,453 --> 01:40:22,221
John!

856
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:03,323

01:41:04,135 --> 01:41:06,271
