- I think your tape...
- Oh, Jesus!

00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,068
...got eaten.

5
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,026
Jesus! That was good!

6
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,738
- Yeah. They're great, Creedence.
- This thing's brand new!

7
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,459
- How about the radio?
- Radio doesn't work.

8
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,779
You can't get anything out here.
No entertainment.

9
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,542
Now there's no entertainment. Damn it!

10
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,417
Well, I guess we just have to talk
to each other, huh?

11
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,864
We talked to each other already.

12
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:20,538
Yeah, I know where you're from.

13
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,462
Hey, hey, hey,
want to see something real scary?

14
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,187
- Sure.
- I love this. Okay?

15
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,668
- Yeah, what?
- We're driving along here, right?

16
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:29,661
- Yeah.
- Imagine... Not running out of gas,

17
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,580
- we have plenty of gas. All right?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,547
Oh, my God!
What are those gravel beds up ahead?

19
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,301
They're gonna fly up
and knock out our lights.

20
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:39,906
- Hey, come on.
- Blackness. Oh, my goodness.

21
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,901
Why, there could be nuns ahead,
we wouldn't even see them.

22
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,308
- Isn't this amazing? Look!
- Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:45,742
I don't know whether it's too safe.

24
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,104
DRIVER: I used to play chicken
and see how far we could drive

25
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,623
without someone, either the passenger
or the driver, going, "Stop."

26
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,778
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh, my God, huh?

27
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,461
- I think you better just...
- Who's chicken, huh?

28
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,347
...turn the lights on now.
- Is that a bear up there?

29
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:58,824
Uh-oh, more pebbles.

30
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:02,106
Oh, my goodness. It looks like
they're out permanently this time.

31
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,259
- This is dangerous.
- No. The road's straight,

32
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,226
it's just kind of scary, a little.
What is that up ahead?

33
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,458
Something might come up ahead.

34
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,017
- Yeah, right.
- A big, huge squirrel!

35
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,907
Chicks love that.

36
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:14,742
- That's scary enough.
- I know. I like it.

37
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,826
- Hey, you like trivia?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,218
Okay. Want to play TV theme songs?

39
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:21,981
- Sure.
- You know how to play that?

40
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,388
- No.
- I'll hum a theme song.

41
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,223
If you guess it, you get to hum one.
If I guess it, I get to have it back.

42
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,504
- Okay.
- Lf you get three in a row, you win.

43

Bonanza! All right.

- Real McCoys.

- Thanks for the Fred Gwynne.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

56
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:06,501
All right. How about this one?

57
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,103
Know it?

58
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,822
Look at that fossil

59
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,258
It's stuck over there in the tar

60
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,466
Look at that old man
He looks like an old ape

61
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:19,899
- What is it?
- No.

62
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,707
Look at that old bone

63
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,507
It could be worth some bucks

64
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,625
- What is it?
- I don't know.

65
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,065
Look at those two apes
This must be where they lived

66
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,341
Look at that city
Let's continue to dig

67
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,823
- What is it?
- I really don't know.

68
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,548
It's National Geographic.
National Geographic.

69
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,780
- Okay, all right. Okay, I got one for you.
- Okay.

70
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:45,544
Yes.

71
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:48,502
What is it?

72
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,388
I don't know, but you're doing it great.
Sounds like it was on CBS.

73
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,903
- You know what...
- I don't know.

74
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:04,379
- "Book him, Danno. Book him, Danno."
- "Book him, Danno. Book him, Danno."

75
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,388
One more hint.

76
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,263
- What was its locale? Locale?
- Surfboards.

77
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,103
- "An island in the Pacific Ocean."
- Gilligan's Island!

78
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,304
- Hawaii Five-O!
- Yes.

79
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,425
Jesus, I thought I was good at this.

80
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,898
Did you ever watch The Twilight Zone?

81
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,307
Oh, God, remember The Twilight Zone
with Burgess Meredith?

82
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,300
Remember, he loved to read,

83
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,744
and there was a nuclear war,
and he had no friends anyway,

84
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:33,944
and he was down
in the basement of the library.

85
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,144
- Oh, yeah, with the glasses!
- Yes.

86
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,140
He was the last man
and he broke his glasses.

87
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:38,218
- Yeah.
- This thing freaked me out.

88
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,539
When I was seven years old,
I bought another pair of glasses

89
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,948
just in case that would happen.

90
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:44,418
Those shows, they were so good,
they were so scary.

91
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,544
- Yeah.
- They were great.

92
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,699
Remember the one
where the guy had the stopwatch?

93
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,222
Somebody in a bar gave him a stopwatch,

94
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:50,742
and he was this real obnoxious guy.

95
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,219
And he took the stopwatch, and he hit it,
and everybody else in time froze but him.

96
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:56,539
- That's an Outer Limits.
- No, that was a Zone.

97
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,904
- That's an Outer Limits.
- That was a Zone.

98
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,104
Well, they had one about the mannequins

99
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,463
that got two weeks off
and turned into humans

100
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,699
and they were allowed to go out
and shop for two weeks on their own.

101
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,268
And then this one came back
and it was over two weeks,

102
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,021
and the other mannequins went
"Come over here for a minute"

103
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,748
- and turned her into plastic.
- Boy, they were scary. They were great.

104
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:10,978
I loved it.

105
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,266
Hey, you want to see something
really scary?

106
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,828
You bet!

107
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,388
- Really?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,668
Okay, this is really, really scary now.

109
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,742
- I trust you.
- Okay, pull the car over.

110
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:27,460
- Pull the car over?
- You want to see it?

111
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:30,143
- Well, show me while I'm driving.
- No, I can't. I can't tell you about it.

112
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,264
It should only take a couple of seconds.

113
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,464
All right. Two seconds. Okay?

114
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:33,584
- Okay.
- What is it?

115
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:34,658
- Just pull it over.
- Okay.

116
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,784
- I'll show you.
- All right.

117
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,664
Okay.

118
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,668
Scare me.

119
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:51,058
- Are you ready?
- Okay, go ahead.

120
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,547
What are you doing?

121

(SNARLING)

122
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,099
NARRA TOR. You unlock this door
with the key of imagination.

123
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,783
Beyond it is another dimension,

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,986
a dimension of sound,

a dimension of sight,

126
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,945
a dimension of mind.

127
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,146
You're moving into a land
of both shadow and substance,

128

of things and ideas.

129
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,102
You've just crossed over
into the Twilight Zone.

130
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,377
You're about to meet an angry man,
Mr. William Connor,

131
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,701
who carries on his shoulder a chip
the size of the national debt.

132
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:07,180
This is a sour man, a lonely man,
who's tired of waiting for the breaks

133
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,908
that come to others but never to him.

134
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:15,268
Mr. William Connor, whose own
blind hatred is about to catapult him

135
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,627
into the darkest corner
of the Twilight Zone.

136
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,507
Hey! Hey! Bill!

137
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,904
- How you doing?
- All right.

138
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:36,301
I can't stay long. My wife's relatives
from Florida are coming over for dinner.

139
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,698
Hey, girl, another beer over here!

140
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,622
Bill, you look kind of cranky this evening.

141
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,745
Yeah, I'm pissed, all right.

142
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,787
Know that guy Goldman?

143
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,825
You didn't get promoted?

144
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,984
They gave it to that Jew bastard.

145
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,183
Why don't you come over here
and cheer me up? I need it.

146
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,987
Just drink your beer.

147
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:05,464
What about you? You want to cheer me up?

148
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,221
Don't touch me.

149
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,780
"Don't touch me." Okay.

150
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,907
I think she likes you, Bill.

151
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,627
- I can't believe it, you know? I can't.
- Bill, drink your beer. Relax.

152
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:20,620
What do you mean, "relax"?

153
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,939
They give Goldman my promotion
and you're telling me to relax.

154
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,065
You know
what that would've meant to me?

155
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,788
An extra $6,000 a year that I'd earn.

156
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,060
You know, them kikes,

157
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,185
they always get more money.
You know that, don't you?

158
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,987
How long has Goldman been there?

159
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,379
So what if he's been there longer than me?
So what? I'm better than him!

160
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,221
I worked hard for that promotion,
and what happens?

161
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:41,742
They give it to some Jew.

162
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:44,059
I mean, what else do the hell they want,
for Christ's sake?

163
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,377
They own everything as it is.

164
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:48,347
Come on, Bill,
the Jews don't own everything.

165
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,067
The Arabs won't let them.

166
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:55,148
Arabs. What the hell is that?
Just a nigger wrapped up in a sheet.

167
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,147
- He's on a roll now.
- I'll tell you something.

168
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:01,378
I don't know what's the matter
with this country,

169
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:03,460

00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:09,147
Welcome to Sherwood, milady.
What, Sir Guy? No greetings from you?

507
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:11,618
Why are you doing in here,
you little ragamuffin?

508
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:16,260
How dare you come in here at this hour
of the night and frighten these people.

509
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,063
Please, take me with you.

510
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,386
I want to go, too.

511
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:37,819
You can't come with me, Leo.

512
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,942
You'll have to stay with yourself.

513
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:49,784
"There's a destiny that shapes our ends,
roughhewn though it may be."

514
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:52,822
I'm sorry.

515
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,421
Well, let's away!

516
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:01,105
But I'm ready now.

517
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:04,667
I'm ready.

518
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,422
AGEE: It's wonderful to be young again!

519
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:11,184
Beware the thrust of my steel. Tallyho!

520
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:07,067
He'll get it.

521
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,946
Tomatoes are on the fence.

522
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:18,337
We've been saying for years
that we'd go and see that lake.

523
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:20,021
Let's ask Murray to come along.

524
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:22,782
Let's ask Mr. Conroy,
he could bring his grandchild.

525
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:28,421
Mr. Agee! Mr. Agee!
Has anyone seen Mr. Agee?

526
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:30,022
Hannah?

527
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:43,263
Why are you sitting around moping,
sitting around hoping

528
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:44,987
Just listen to me

529
00:44:45,709 --> 00:44:50,419
I'm sure that you will agree
Age means nothing

530
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:13,383
- Mr. Bloom?
- In person.

531
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:16,620
Oh, how wonderful!
We were expecting you.

532
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:21,180
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
our new guest has arrived.

533
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:41,585
NARRA TOR. Portrait of a woman in transit.
Helen Foley, age 27.

534
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:44,024
Occupation, schoolteacher.

535
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:48,705
Up until now, the pattern of her life
has been one of unrelenting sameness,

536
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:51,701
waiting for something different to happen.

537
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:57,422
Helen Foley doesn't know it yet,
but her waiting has just ended.

538
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:01,699
Okay, I give up. Where am I?

539
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:03,108
Well, you're not lost.

540
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:06,977
It looks like you missed a turnoff
at Cliffordville right there.

541
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:11,347
Yeah, okay, half mile down the road's
a gas station, that's Beaumont.

542
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:12,623
You hang a left and you go four blocks.

543
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:14,506
The highway cuts right in front of it.
You can't miss it.

544
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:16,307
You probably...

545
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,345
Hey, kid, easy on the machinery.

546
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:23,908
It doesn't work right.

547
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,457
Kid, I don't build the games,
I just keep the quarters.

548
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,858
Why don't you stick another quarter in,
maybe it'll work better.

549
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:33,020
See, the highway splits
right outside of town, it goes off...

550
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,860
Walter, the kid is screwing up the TV.

551
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:38,860
Hey, it's his quarter.
The TV's free, you know.

552
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,428
Yeah? I got 20 bucks on this.

553
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,988
Lots of luck.

554
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:46,663
So, where you headed?

555
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,179
- Willoughby.
- Hey, nice town.

556
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:54,818
- You got a job set up there or what?
- No, not really.

557
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:56,979
- Where you from?
- Homewood.

558
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:58,104
(PHONE RINGING)

559
00:46:58,189 --> 00:46:59,224
Nice town.

560
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,743
- Lf you say so.
- MAN: Hello. Yeah.

561
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:04,104
Hey, Walter, it's your wife.

562
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,907
- Your wife.
- Thanks.

563
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:16,378
...cannot hurt him. There's a left-hand...

564
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:20,582
- Okay.
- Hey, Charlie.

565
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:23,820
Hey, come on, man, take it easy.
Take it easy.

566
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:26,743
That's it.

567
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:28,942
That's enough!

568
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,021
What's going on here?

569
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:34,947
Hey, what happened?

570
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:40,906
Hey, look, I don't know
what happened, lady.

571
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,707
Whatever happened, I'm sorry.

572
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:45,178
Yes, well...

573
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:48,705
Hey, forget about the sandwich. No charge.

574
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:49,778
Terrific.

575
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:54,661
- Nice town.
- That was real good.

576
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:56,421
Thanks a lot, guys.

577
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:17,466
Oh, my God.

578
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:18,698
Are you all right?

579
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:19,778
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

580
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:22,821
Are you sure? Here. Let me see.

581
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,586
Oh, shit. God.

582
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:31,107
Oh, no! Look at that!
Look, I'll give you some money.

583
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,419
- Can you get it fixed?
- Yeah.

584
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:37,257
- Could you maybe give me a ride home?
- Sure.

585
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,241
HELEN: You live all the way out here?

586
00:48:47,686 --> 00:48:49,881
I'll bet your parents are worried about you.

587
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:51,957
- Not really.
- No?

588
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:56,322
Today's my birthday.
They don't even care about that.

589
00:48:58,646 --> 00:48:59,999
Really?

590
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:02,115
Wow.

591
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,357
- What a crummy birthday.
- It's okay.

592
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,004
I made a friend.

593
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:10,085
Me, too.

594
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:12,559
I'm Anthony.

595
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:17,598
- Helen Foley.
- I'm very glad to meet you, Helen.

596
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:19,085
Thank you.

597
00:49:49,246 --> 00:49:50,804
What a lovely house.

598
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:52,080
- You like it?
- Yeah.

599
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:54,441
It's really peaceful out here by itself.

600
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,485
Come on in.

601
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:28,885
Hello? It's me!

602
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:31,036
- Hi, Anthony!
- Hi!

603
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:33,082
- Well, well, well.
- Hello.

604
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:36,715
- Anthony's home!
- Look at this. How do you do?

605
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:39,320
- This is Helen.
- Is that right? Helen?

606
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:41,681
Helen, delighted to meet you.
Any friend of Anthony's is a friend...

607
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:42,915
Hello.

608
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,600
This is Uncle Walt and my sister, Ethel.

609
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:46,721
How do you do?

610
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:50,003
Well, now, did I hear Anthony come in?

611
00:50:50,086 --> 00:50:53,158
- Yes, there he is!
- This is my mother and father.

612
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:54,281
- Hello.
- Hello.

613
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:56,641
- This is Helen.
- Helen Foley.

614
00:50:56,726 --> 00:50:57,795
Helen. Delighted.

615
00:50:57,886 --> 00:51:00,605
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Helen.
- She gave me a ride home.

616
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:02,517
- Did she?
- You don't mean it!

617
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:03,959
Very generous of you.

618
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:06,719
Yes, well, I'm afraid
we had a little accident.

619
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:08,960
Accident?

620
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:12,004
Yes, well, I knocked Anthony down
while he was riding his bicycle.

621
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:15,874
- Did you?
- You knocked him down?

622
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:17,601
Yes.

623
00:51:19,366 --> 00:51:20,924
(FATHER LAUGHING)

624
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:23,440
Well, doesn't look like
there was any harm done.

625
00:51:23,526 --> 00:51:27,405
- WALT: No, sir. No, sir. Anthony's fine.
- Oh, yes. Yes, Anthony's fine!

626
00:51:27,486 --> 00:51:29,761
- Can Helen stay for supper, Mother?
- Oh, no, really, I was just...

627
00:51:29,846 --> 00:51:31,279
- What a wonderful idea!
- ETHEL: Good idea.

628
00:51:31,366 --> 00:51:33,482
Of course she can!

629
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,963
Well, that would be lovely.

630
00:51:38,046 --> 00:51:40,276
- ANTHONY: Can we eat right now?
- Oh, yes.

631
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:41,560
Sure! Why not!

632
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:44,206
WALT: Why not?
We can eat anytime we want.

633
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:46,356
- May I wash my hands?
- Right this way.

634
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:48,801
- You may leave this.
- All right.

635
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:52,435
- And I'll help you with your sweater.
- Thank you.

636
00:51:53,766 --> 00:51:55,836
See you in a little while.

637
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:06,765
Mind the step.

638
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:40,525
Anthony.

639
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,394
Anthony?

640
00:52:57,686 --> 00:52:58,914
Anthony?

641
00:53:00,686 --> 00:53:02,199
Ah, the beach.

642
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:04,157
(OTHERS CHATTERING)

643
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:07,323
Oh, I used to love the beach.

644
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:10,480
FATHER: Well then, you don't get a light.

645
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:12,124
Give me a light
and you can have a cigarette.

646
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:13,719
You give me a cigarette,
then you can have a light.

647
00:53:13,806 --> 00:53:15,285
It doesn't work that way. I found them first.

648
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,355
Don't tell me how it works.

649
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:20,001
Here. Here. Where is that mirror?
You two shouldn't be smoking, anyway.

650
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:21,519
You know it isn't good for you.

651
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:37,480
Hello.

652
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:45,795
That's Sara, my other sister.

653
00:53:47,606 --> 00:53:49,483
She was in an accident.

654
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:04,359
ANTHONY: Here I come.

655
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:10,163
I always like to let them know
when I'm coming.

656
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,401
- We're ready to eat now.
- MOTHER: Wonderful!

657

WALT: Well, that's marvelous!

658
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:17,205
FATHER: Great! I'm starving.
WALT: Me, too. Me, too.

659
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:28,637
Well, let's get started.
I bet Anthony is really hungry.

660
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,876
Come on, now. Here you go.

662
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:36,877
Well, now, you know, we are so happy
that you can eat with us.

663
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:40,720
You know, Anthony is so thoughtful
about things like that.

664
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:43,161
Would you like to sit beside me?

665
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:45,796
- Maybe your mother would...
- Oh, no, no, no.

666
00:54:45,886 --> 00:54:48,275
You see, I'm going to have
to be fixing supper.

667
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:49,685
Yes, that's right.

668
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,916
You sit right next to Anthony.

669
00:54:52,006 --> 00:54:54,361
Oh, that's fine. Just fine.

670
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:56,562
- All right. All right.
- Very good, yes.

672
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:08,760
don't you dare bring
one more thing into this house!

673
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:11,280
Do you hear me? One more thing!

674
00:55:11,366 --> 00:55:14,324
Not one solitary single thing!

00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:23,283
Darling, do you remember where supper is?

678
00:55:23,926 --> 00:55:25,723
You know where it is.

679
00:55:27,646 --> 00:55:31,002
- I do?
- In the oven, isn't it, Mother?

680
00:55:32,606 --> 00:55:35,837
Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Of course.

681
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,879
- How silly of me.
- She never knows.

682
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:45,562
- I'll help you find it, Mother.
- We'll be back in just a little while.

683
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:48,677
We cartoon characters
can have a wonderful life,

684
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:50,643
if we only take advantage of it.

685
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:55,277
- We can do anything we think of.
- What do you mean, chum?

686
00:55:55,366 --> 00:55:57,926
Well, supposing I decide
I want to be a mouse.

687
00:55:58,486 --> 00:55:59,635
I'm a mouse.

688
00:56:00,726 --> 00:56:02,478
ANTHONY: This is a good cartoon.

689

(HELEN AGREEING)

690
00:56:04,646 --> 00:56:07,683
- What else do you like?
- Nothing else is as good.

691
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:10,561
Anything can happen in cartoons.

692
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:14,161
- Here we go!
- Good eatings for everybody.

693
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:17,124
- Yummy, yummy, yummy!
- Yes, sir.

694
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:18,639
All right, all right, come on.

695
00:56:18,726 --> 00:56:23,436
Anthony, this is yours, dear,
in your regular place right there.

696
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:26,279
And, Helen, why don't you sit right here
next to Anthony.

697
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:28,596
- This is for you, Uncle Walt.
- Thank you.

698
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,085
- There we are.
- Here you go, Mother.

699
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:32,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mother.

700
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,441
You're welcome, Anthony.

701
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,998
- I love this. This is great.
- It really hits the spot.

702
00:56:55,686 --> 00:56:57,005
Okay?

703
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:58,800
Fine.

704
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,480
Peanut butter. It's good that way.

705
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:16,719
- Peanut butter makes the burger.
- That's right. That's right.

706
00:57:16,806 --> 00:57:19,001
Wouldn't go down otherwise.

707
00:57:20,486 --> 00:57:21,965
Peanut butter's good for you.

708
00:57:25,446 --> 00:57:27,323
I could eat another plateful.

709
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:38,845
Do you eat like this all the time?

710
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:42,043
Anthony can always have
anything he wants.

711
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,435
- Anything at all.
- You bet.

712
00:57:44,526 --> 00:57:46,915
Well, don't you think it's good?

713
00:57:47,606 --> 00:57:50,439
You're young. You need your nutrition.

714
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:53,405
You can't eat like this all the time.

715
00:58:03,926 --> 00:58:06,121
It's not good all the time.

716
00:58:07,286 --> 00:58:10,676
- No, it's not!
- Anthony, that is absolutely right!

717
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,760
- You hit the nail on the head!
- You are so right!

718
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:16,316
You never tell me that!

719
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,440
Not happy birthday!

720
00:58:21,526 --> 00:58:25,155
No, not happy birthday!

721
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:29,003
Of course! It's a birthday supper.

722
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:34,277
Another birthday? With presents?
And wishes?

723
00:58:37,486 --> 00:58:38,999
I didn't do it!

724
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:44,646
It's okay. Everything's okay.

725
00:58:45,686 --> 00:58:48,325
I'm sorry, Anthony.
I really have to be going.

726
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:50,124
No, please don't go!

727
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:53,681
Uncle Walt's gonna do a trick!

728
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:55,675
He's gonna do a trick.

729
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:58,326
MOTHER:
Oh, you've got to stay for the trick!

730
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:00,044
He's going to do a trick!

731
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:02,401
Come back. Come back. Wait. Wait.

732
00:59:02,486 --> 00:59:04,920
- Do the hat trick, Uncle Walt.
- Yes. Oh, yes.

733
00:59:05,006 --> 00:59:08,442
- Where's the hat?
- It's on the TV.

734
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:15,717
- There it is. All right.
- Now, then, you've got to stay here.

735
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,364
You sit right down there.

736
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:21,082
The hat trick.

737
00:59:21,886 --> 00:59:23,638
Well, let's see.

738
00:59:24,926 --> 00:59:29,875
Nothing up the sleeve. There we go.
That's it. Nothing up the sleeve. See that?

739
00:59:33,566 --> 00:59:37,718
Well, nothing up the sleeve and...

740
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:43,556
And... I beg your pardon. Excuse me. Yes.

741
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,843
- Go ahead, Uncle Walt.
- Oh, yes, yes.

742
00:59:46,926 --> 00:59:49,838
But the hat. Where's the hat?

743
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:57,681
Nothing, as you can see, in the hat, right?

744
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,234
Nothing in the hat.

745
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:03,801
So...

746
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:09,199
You'll like this. Do it, Uncle Walt!

747
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:11,719
Yes, sir.

748
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:20,405
- Go ahead, Uncle Walt!
- Yes.

749
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:44,680
You see?

750
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:47,517
Isn't this fun? We do it a lot.

751
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,518
- You'll love it here.
- You'll really like it here. Really. I promise.

752
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:53,040
- I swear you'll like it.
- Do more!

755
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:04,720
Go away!

756
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:17,402
Please don't go, Helen.
I can make it real nice here.

757
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:20,683
I can make the food
just the way you said it should be.

758
01:01:20,766 --> 01:01:22,882
I can even change the house.

759
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:27,395
Just say it and I can make
whatever you like. Just don't...

760
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:37,479
I told you. They hate me!

761
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,636
They want to send me away
to someplace bad

762
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:42,160
just like my real mother and father did.

763
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:44,601
That's not right, Anthony.
You know we wouldn't do that.

764
01:01:44,686 --> 01:01:47,120
No, we love you, Anthony. Honestly, we do.

765
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:49,117
- Sure.
- ANTHONY: They're afraid of me!

766
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,436
Everybody is.
That's why they act that way.

767
01:01:51,526 --> 01:01:53,357
And I do everything for them.

768
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,006
They can just sit around
and watch TV all day.

769
01:01:56,086 --> 01:01:58,759
No one has to do a thing. Not a thing!

770
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:01,997
- And I'm real good all the time.
- That's right. You're a good boy, Anthony.

771
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:05,681
- You're a good boy. We love you.
- Yeah.

772
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:08,439
Well, then, I wonder who wrote this note.

773
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:11,359
I wonder who called me a monster.

774
01:02:11,446 --> 01:02:12,799
It wasn't me, Anthony.

775
01:02:12,886 --> 01:02:15,958
Why, I'd never do anything like that,
you know that.

776
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:19,595
- Don't look at me.
- Me either!

777
01:02:19,686 --> 01:02:21,881
It wasn't any of us, Anthony. It was her!

778
01:02:21,966 --> 01:02:24,355
- No. It wasn't me!
- No, her, her. Ethel! Ethel!

779
01:02:24,446 --> 01:02:27,085
It must have been Ethel.
Of course, it had to have been Ethel.

780
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,315
- That's right.
- Yes.

781
01:02:28,406 --> 01:02:32,160
Ethel! There you are. It was Ethel.
That's right.

782
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:35,756
- Oh, great.
- MOTHER: It had to have been Ethel.

783
01:02:35,846 --> 01:02:38,041
Of course, it was Ethel. Of course.

784
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:41,755
Oh, I didn't know that.

785
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:45,361
What a big surprise. Ethel, huh?

786
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:48,995
Go ahead, Anthony. Do it! Do it!

787
01:02:49,086 --> 01:02:51,156
Do what, Ethel?

788
01:02:51,246 --> 01:02:53,760
Now, do you realize
you'll never get out of here?

789
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:56,121
You think it was an accident
you came here?

790
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:57,798
He made it happen.

791
01:02:57,886 --> 01:03:02,243
He brought you here, just like
he brought us here and kept us here.

792
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:04,999
Just the way he'll keep you here.

793
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:07,919
Maybe he'll get mad at you
like he did to his real sister

794
01:03:08,006 --> 01:03:09,359
and cripple you and take away your mouth

795
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:12,404
so you won't be able
to yell at him anymore.

796
01:03:12,486 --> 01:03:16,718
Or maybe he'll do to you
what he did to his real mother and father.

797
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:19,320
Time for you to go now, Ethel.

798
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:24,642
- Anthony, don't!
- It's a big surprise.

799
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:29,043
I just made it up.

800
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:33,755
I'm wishing you into cartoonland.

Jesus.

802
01:03:42,326 --> 01:03:44,442
I told you cartoons are good.

803
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:52,604
- Anything can happen in them.
- We've been expecting you.

That's all, Ethel.

807

I can't help it, Helen.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

808

All I want is for people
not to be afraid of me.

You don't understand. Nobody does.

810

All I have to do is wish for something
and it happens.

811
01:04:50,326 --> 01:04:52,237
I can do anything.

Wish it away!

- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

821
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:18,314
And the others?

822
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:22,884
I sent them where they wanted to go,
away from me.

823
01:07:23,726 --> 01:07:25,398
It's not fair.

824
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:28,603
You're supposed to be happy
when your wishes come true.

You're supposed to be happy
when your wishes come true.

Anthony, take us back.

827
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:39,485
Take us back.

828
01:07:39,566 --> 01:07:41,363
So you can leave, too?

829
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:45,877
And go where, Anthony?

830
01:07:47,366 --> 01:07:49,357
I've seen what you can do.

831
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:54,677
I know you have a power,
a gift that makes you special.

832
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,758
You better be careful,

or one day

All right.

849
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:32,758
Look in your pocket.

850
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:42,645
Never mind.

851
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:43,720
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

852
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:48,963
NARRA TOR. What you're
looking at could be the end

853
01:10:49,046 --> 01:10:51,276
of a particularly terrifying nightmare.

854
01:10:51,366 --> 01:10:54,358
It isn't. It's the beginning.

855
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:58,155
Introducing Mr. John Valentine,
air traveler.

856
01:10:58,246 --> 01:11:01,716
His destination, the Twilight Zone.

857
01:11:15,086 --> 01:11:17,236
(BEEPING)

858
01:11:18,686 --> 01:11:20,597
MAN. Ladies and gentlemen,
this storm has developed

859
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:22,642
a little faster than we had anticipated.

860
01:11:22,726 --> 01:11:23,795
We're maneuvering about,

861
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:26,639
finding the smoothest spots with radar.

862
01:11:26,726 --> 01:11:29,479
There's still a chance that we might hit
some uh-ohs and whoopsy-daisies,

863
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:30,601
(BANGING ON DOOR)

864
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:33,519
So I'm asking you to return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.

865
01:11:33,606 --> 01:11:35,676
Please extinguish your cigarettes

866
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:38,200
or anything that might fly about
in the aircraft,

867
01:11:38,286 --> 01:11:39,719
look out the window and enjoy...

868
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:41,285
Hello in there.

869
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,358
Can you hear me?

870
01:11:45,686 --> 01:11:47,119
Hello.

871
01:11:49,526 --> 01:11:53,439
Oh, hi. It's a passenger that's been in there
for a long time.

872
01:11:54,326 --> 01:11:57,363
- Tall? Fair-haired?
- Yeah. Yeah. Seat 4A.

873
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:58,595
Oh, yeah, Valentine.

874
01:11:58,686 --> 01:12:00,483
I had a feeling about him.
White-knuckle type.

875
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,204
How are we gonna get him out
of the bathroom?

876
01:12:02,286 --> 01:12:04,004
- Is there something wrong?
- No, no, no. Everything's fine.

877
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,839
Mr. Valentine? May I help you?

878
01:12:08,446 --> 01:12:10,084
Just a moment.

879
01:12:48,806 --> 01:12:52,719
Dionne, why don't you knock?
Something could be wrong.

880
01:12:52,806 --> 01:12:56,685
Let's give him a few more minutes.
Are you okay?

881
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,360
No problem.

882
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:03,200
Look, Mr. Valentine, I know how you feel.
Lots of people are nervous about flying.

883
01:13:03,286 --> 01:13:06,483
But if you look at statistics,
you're safer up here than on the ground.

884
01:13:06,566 --> 01:13:08,158
That's right.
Safer than your own bathroom.

885
01:13:08,246 --> 01:13:09,998
No, I'll be perfectly fine.

886
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:13,314
Oh, dear!

887
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:16,079
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna help you back to your seat.

888
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,236
Actually, the chances of drowning
in the bathroom,

889
01:13:18,326 --> 01:13:20,840
the bathtub, is something
like 8/100,000 of a percent,

890
01:13:20,926 --> 01:13:24,396
whereas air crash fatalities
from last year's figures,

891
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:26,761
the number of passengers
who traveled by air last year,

892
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:28,325
is equal to the population
of the whole country.

893
01:13:28,406 --> 01:13:29,964
That's...

894
01:13:30,046 --> 01:13:34,961
That's 426,504,000... I forget the rest.

895
01:13:35,046 --> 01:13:39,119
The people who died at home,
they outnumber the people...

896
01:13:40,406 --> 01:13:41,475
...much more than...

897
01:13:41,566 --> 01:13:43,955
Whereas driving... Driving, forget it.

898
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:49,803
The percentage of people
who die driving, 22, 23o/o of...

899
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,686
- Do I need my boarding pass?
- No, you don't.

900
01:13:53,766 --> 01:13:56,155
Watch your head. Watch your head.

901
01:13:58,366 --> 01:14:00,163
That a boy.

902
01:14:00,246 --> 01:14:02,157
I think I spilled my drink.

903
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,083
I think I spilled my drink.

904
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:07,839
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Here, let me fix you up.

905
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:10,681
Let me put things away here.

906
01:14:12,566 --> 01:14:15,524
Micro Chip Logic,
The Liberation of the Left Brain.

907
01:14:15,606 --> 01:14:19,838
- Science fiction fan, huh?
- No, that's a textbook. Computers.

908
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:22,599
- Do you really read this stuff?
- I wrote it.

909
01:14:22,686 --> 01:14:24,756
Oh, my goodness, so you did.

910
01:14:24,846 --> 01:14:27,838
I'll tell you what, we'll put this away,
and you try to get some sleep.

911
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:31,123
No, no, no...
I'd like you to leave the light on.

912
01:14:31,206 --> 01:14:34,676
Okay. I'll take this. Okay? Come on.

913
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:38,120
Tell you what. I'll put this in a safe place.

914
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:41,642
Look, you're gonna be fine,
so cheer up, okay?

915
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:43,398
Get some water.

916
01:14:46,326 --> 01:14:47,759
Let's get this seat belt fastened.

917
01:14:47,846 --> 01:14:50,963
- What? Is something wrong?
- No, no, everything's fine.

918
01:14:51,806 --> 01:14:55,765
Look, we're not supposed to do this,
but I have these sedatives.

919
01:14:55,846 --> 01:14:58,565
- They might help you sleep.
- No, it's...

920
01:14:58,646 --> 01:15:01,240
It's all right. I don't need anything.
I'll be fine.

921
01:15:01,326 --> 01:15:05,285
- They're very mild.
- No. Thank you, but I'll be all right.

922
01:15:07,286 --> 01:15:09,846
- This will cost you four bucks.
- What did you say?

923
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:12,315
- Only kidding.
- Well, I'm not kidding.

924
01:15:12,406 --> 01:15:13,725
We've got to get you back
to your seat now.

925
01:15:13,806 --> 01:15:15,717
- I want to stay here!
- Oh, no, no, no.

926
01:15:15,806 --> 01:15:17,558
We've got to get you back here.

927
01:15:17,886 --> 01:15:20,480
Here we go.
Now let's fasten your seat belt.

928
01:15:20,566 --> 01:15:23,034
- I don't need my seat belt fastened.
- Oh, yes, you do.

929
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:24,684
We wouldn't want you to fall out.

930
01:15:24,766 --> 01:15:27,280
- I'm not gonna fall out.
- Not if you sit here, you won't.

931
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:29,118
- Okay?
- Okay.

932
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,120
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

933
01:15:33,206 --> 01:15:35,845
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

934
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:40,078
Look, I'm Dionne.
Anything you need, call me.

935
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:43,522
Well, thank you, but I'm sure I'll be fine.

936
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:46,761
Really, I'll be fine.

937
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:48,635
Okay.

938
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:09,045
(WHISTLING)

939
01:16:09,126 --> 01:16:11,560
You heard the Captain. No smoking.

940
01:16:11,646 --> 01:16:15,036
N-O S-M-O-K-l-N-G.

941
01:16:15,126 --> 01:16:16,844
No smoking!

942
01:17:53,446 --> 01:17:55,437
There's something out there!

943
01:17:55,526 --> 01:17:58,165
There's something moving, I saw it!

944
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:02,725
There's a man on the wing of this plane!

945
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,485
There was somebody out there.

946
01:18:31,566 --> 01:18:35,161
- You've got to believe me!
- I saw him. Green and slimy.

947
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:37,919
- Leave the poor man alone.
- I'm only trying to help.

948
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,964
- You've got to humor them.
- There was lightning.

949
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:43,765
At first I thought it was an animal,
some kind of a bird or something,

950
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:44,961
but it was a man!

951
01:18:45,046 --> 01:18:48,004
There were flames
coming out of the engine,

952
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:51,158
and then a flash and then smoke!

953
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:55,559
Maybe it was a technician who was caught
on the plane when it took off.

954
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,796
My God, how could he survive out there?
The air is too thin.

955
01:18:57,886 --> 01:19:02,118
The blast of the wind. It's... It's so cold.

956
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:10,442
It's impossible, isn't it?

957
01:19:14,646 --> 01:19:17,843
My God. I feel so stupid.

958
01:19:30,046 --> 01:19:31,638
Can you imagine?

959
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:36,004
A naked man crawling along the wing
of an airplane at 35,000 feet?

960
01:19:36,086 --> 01:19:38,839
There's no reason to feel embarrassed,
Mr. Valentine.

961
01:19:38,926 --> 01:19:43,875
- Just try to get some sleep.
- It's amazing, the mind,

962
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:47,278
how the eyes can make you see
something that isn't even there.

963
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:48,515
There's a man in seat 3F

964
01:19:48,606 --> 01:19:50,801
that's completely freaking out.

965
01:19:51,326 --> 01:19:53,078
Look, you're just gonna
have to deal with him.

966
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,885
It's all right.
You don't have to stay with me.

967
01:19:55,966 --> 01:19:58,434
I know you have other passengers
to attend to.

968
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,118
I'm happy to sit with you till you sleep.

969
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:04,085
No, it's probably easier for me if I'm alone.

970
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,963
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

971
01:20:07,046 --> 01:20:09,514
I'm drowsy already.

972
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,275
(SNORING)

973
01:20:14,566 --> 01:20:17,399
- You see?
- Okay.

974
01:22:05,526 --> 01:22:07,357
Get the handcuffs.

975
01:22:21,366 --> 01:22:25,405
I'm all right! I'm all right! I'm all right!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

976
01:22:28,846 --> 01:22:31,599
FAA security.
You want me to take care of this?

977
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:32,914
No. It's all right. He'll be all right.

978
01:22:33,006 --> 01:22:34,564
You've got to land the plane!
There's a man outside.

979
01:22:34,646 --> 01:22:36,523
- Just take your seat.
- You've got to let me outside.

980
01:22:37,566 --> 01:22:39,522
Could everybody sit down? Sit down!

981
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:43,121
Get in your seats.
I want all the passengers in their seats.

982
01:22:44,486 --> 01:22:46,442
Yes, thank you very much.

983
01:22:47,246 --> 01:22:49,555
Get this thing on the ground!
You gotta get this thing onto the ground!

984
01:22:49,646 --> 01:22:51,523
- You gotta get this on the ground!
- Do you know where you are?

985
01:22:51,606 --> 01:22:53,039
- Mr. Valentine!
- Get us on the ground!

986
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:56,004
- Take care of the little girl.
- Okay. Come here, darling.

987
01:22:56,086 --> 01:23:00,955
- Handcuffs! Far out!
- That's it. Relax.

988
01:23:01,046 --> 01:23:02,525
Come on, honey, you belong over here.

989
01:23:02,606 --> 01:23:04,995
- Mommy!
- That a girl, that's it.

990
01:23:05,086 --> 01:23:07,395
Mommy, a strange man, he's got me!

991
01:23:07,486 --> 01:23:09,397
My God, what has she done this time?

992
01:23:09,806 --> 01:23:11,524
Take deep breaths, Mr. Valentine.

993
01:23:11,606 --> 01:23:13,642
Deep, long breaths.

994
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:16,643
Slow. Relax.

995
01:23:17,646 --> 01:23:21,241
That's it. We're safe.

996
01:23:23,126 --> 01:23:25,242
We're gonna have a little talk.

997
01:23:26,446 --> 01:23:28,516
What seems to be the problem?

998
01:23:31,246 --> 01:23:33,885
Will you look out that window, please?

999
01:23:42,886 --> 01:23:45,161
What was I supposed to see out there?

1000
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:51,394
Nothing.

1001
01:23:52,566 --> 01:23:55,558
Nothing at all. I'm sorry I shouted.

1002
01:23:55,646 --> 01:23:57,716
Mr. Valentine,
you've got to see this my way.

1003
01:23:57,806 --> 01:24:00,923
I'm the First Officer of an airplane
in a severe storm.

1004
01:24:01,006 --> 01:24:02,678
Now, I have an irrational passenger.

1005
01:24:02,766 --> 01:24:04,358
You're threatening the safety
of this aircraft

1006
01:24:04,446 --> 01:24:06,357
and you're frightening
the other passengers.

1007
01:24:06,446 --> 01:24:08,801
You either calm down
or we're gonna handcuff you.

1008
01:24:08,886 --> 01:24:11,480
Listen, there's something wrong
with this airplane!

1009
01:24:11,566 --> 01:24:12,635
I don't care what happens to me,

1010
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:16,116
but if somebody doesn't do something
about it, we're all gonna die!

1011
01:24:17,046 --> 01:24:20,322
- That's D-l-E, die!
- You big silly!

1012
01:24:20,406 --> 01:24:22,317
You used to be a normal person!

WOMAN:
Sit down, darling. Come on, okay?

1014
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:28,961
Mr. Valentine, what do you think
is wrong with this aircraft?

1015
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:34,404
- There's an engine out.
- Which one?

1016
01:24:35,046 --> 01:24:37,082
The one on the outside.

1017
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:39,839
Outboard number one. It's out, isn't it?

1018
01:24:40,726 --> 01:24:44,719
- What makes you think that?
- Never mind about that. It's true, isn't it?

1019
01:24:45,766 --> 01:24:48,280
Nine minutes ago, outboard number one
was struck by lightning.

1020
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:49,640
There was a flame-out, and we lost it.

1021
01:24:49,726 --> 01:24:51,921
- Lightning.
- Lightning.

1022
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,442
Mr. Valentine,
this aircraft has four engines.

1023
01:24:57,526 --> 01:25:00,677
The possibility of us losing one of the
remaining three is remote in the extreme.

1024
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:02,961
You're sure it was just lightning?

1025
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:05,965
Absolutely.

1026
01:25:08,766 --> 01:25:12,395
Listen, we're gonna be landing
in about 20 minutes.

1027
01:25:14,006 --> 01:25:17,999
There is the highest probability
that we'll survive this flight.

1028
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:20,555
Okay.

1029
01:25:25,646 --> 01:25:29,605
We'll see you downstairs in 20 minutes.
Sit down. Buckle them up!

1031
01:25:33,686 --> 01:25:35,199
Are you okay?

1032
01:26:01,246 --> 01:26:03,476
No, no, no, no.

1033
01:26:10,526 --> 01:26:11,595
I love you.

1034
01:26:11,686 --> 01:26:14,041
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

1035
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:57,082
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

1036
01:26:59,526 --> 01:27:03,314
What are you doing now?
That's very bad manners, you know!

1037
01:27:04,046 --> 01:27:08,517
- Didn't anyone ever teach you manners?
- Come on. Come on.

1038
01:27:17,326 --> 01:27:18,520
God damn!

1039
01:27:53,126 --> 01:27:55,003
He's got a gun!

1040
01:29:26,086 --> 01:29:31,114
And that's exactly how it happened.
I'm practically a hero.

1041
01:29:31,806 --> 01:29:33,034
Would you believe that?

1042
01:29:33,126 --> 01:29:37,085
CO-PILOT: Weather broke, we would
never have gotten this baby down.

1043
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:38,884
A hell of a night.

1044
01:29:38,966 --> 01:29:42,641
We got the storm, we got the flame-out,
and then that freak show.

1045
01:29:42,726 --> 01:29:45,923
Not to mention the gun.
The gun was awful.

1046
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,635
He didn't have a gun. No, no, no,
he didn't have a gun. It was my gun.

1047
01:29:49,726 --> 01:29:51,682
It was my gun. I'm FAA.
I'm authorized to have a gun.

1048
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:55,918
He was so crazy. He smashed the window.
What was he trying to do? Get out?

1049
01:29:56,006 --> 01:29:59,203
It's claustrophobia! They'd rather fall
to the ground than stay aboard.

1050
01:29:59,286 --> 01:30:02,164
I've seen it happen. I've seen it!

1051
01:30:02,246 --> 01:30:04,555
I knew he was frightened,
but I didn't think he was crazy.

1052
01:30:04,646 --> 01:30:07,080
But, Dionne,
he said he saw something on the wing.

1053
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:09,805
Max, we lost number one.
Check out number two, will you?

1055
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:13,201
All right. Somebody give me a light.
I want the gear pin.

1056
01:30:13,286 --> 01:30:14,765
Let's check these tires.

1057
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:17,599
Franco, let me know
what's going on with these flaps.

1058
01:30:17,686 --> 01:30:20,564
I want to know if there's any fuel
leaking out of this baby.

1059
01:30:20,646 --> 01:30:22,716
And get these people out of here.

1060
01:30:33,766 --> 01:30:37,122
Max! Max! Max!

1061
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:42,522
Holy Toledo!

1062
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:45,404
Hey, you guys, what happened up there?

1063
01:30:56,846 --> 01:30:58,996
That's enough of that noise, huh?

1064
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:02,203
Who needs it anyway?
How about a little music?

1065
01:31:02,286 --> 01:31:03,480
Sure.

So you had a big scare up there, huh?

1070

Oh, yeah.

Want to see something really scary?

1072

NARRA TOR. There is a fifth dimension
beyond that which is known to man.

1073
01:31:38,766 --> 01:31:42,122
It is the middle ground
between light and shadow,

1074

between science and superstition,

1075
01:31:44,446 --> 01:31:50,123
and it lies between the pit of man's fears
and the summit of his knowledge.

1076
01:31:50,206 --> 01:31:52,322
This is the dimension of imagination.

1077
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:55,682
It is an area which we call
the Twilight Zone.
