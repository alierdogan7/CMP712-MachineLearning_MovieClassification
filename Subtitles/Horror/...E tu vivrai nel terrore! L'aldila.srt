1
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,236
In this book i collected all

2
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,231
the prophecies of eibon,

3
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,788
handed down from generation to

4
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,917
generation over more then 4,000 years.

5
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,918
You ungodly warlock.

6
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,638
Because of you this hotel and

7
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,190
this town will be cursed forever.

8
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,794
The seven dreaded gateways are

9
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,189
concealed in 7 cursed places.

10
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,910
Woe be unto him who ventures

11
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,558
near without knowledge.

12
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,719
Be careful what you do because

13
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,631
this hotel was built on one of

14
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,029
the 7 doors of evil

15
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,633
and only i could save you.

16
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,479
Woe be unto him who opens

17
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,471
one of the 7 gateways to hell,

18
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,516
because through that gateway

19
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,795
evil will invade the world.

20
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,557
I told you martin, we can't. All i

21
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,437
inherited was the hotel, nothing else.

22
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,238
But it'd be such a pity not to.

23
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,639
Let me at least finish the plans.

24
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,551
No forget it.
I won't even charge you

25
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,029
for it. Look, really it's not the case.

26
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,031
Ljust wanted to clean up the outside

27
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,156
walls a bit, and maybe tidy up inside

28
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,992
a bit and then, well, business

29
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,671
starts booming we'll see.

30
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,557
It's better we do it now because wait

31
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,073
four months or six and believe me,

32
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,229
you are going to lay out.

33
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,150
You can't imagine the effect

34
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,231
that double digit inflation is

35
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,991
having on housing.

36
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,433
Hi larry. How's it going?

37
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,238
Oh, good morning. I'm gonna have

38
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,719
this whole wall finished by tonight.

39
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,438
Great.
Bye.

40
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,034
Outside is ok. Good old 1800th louisiana,

41
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,996
but the interior.

42
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,229
I mean, hotels just aren't...

43
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,237
the eyes!

44
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,235
The eyes!

45
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,958
The eyes!

46
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,235
Eyes!

47
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,711
Arthur. Where's that doctor?

48
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,715
He's on his way.

49
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,633
This man needs to get to a hospital.

50
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,835
I'll clean up the wounds first. Have

51
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,319
you got any water?

52
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,436
I'm sorry, but till the plumber comes

53
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,238
back i'm afraid i can't get you any.

54
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,910
Then we'd better move him right now.

55
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,228
Give me a hand, will you?

56
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,799
Take the legs... gently...

57
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,032
ok, up, right.
Thank you doctor.

58
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,030
It's ok.

59
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,872
How can i check up on him?

60
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,076
Ask me at the hospital. John mckay.

61
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,750
We're off to a great start. Let's just

62
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,637
hope there isn't any lasting damage.

63
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,472
I sure would like to know how a man

64
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,835
can fall off a scaffolding 6 feet wide.

65
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,037
Liza. Hey, look at this picture.

66
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,189
Weird.

67
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,113
I wasn't aware that you had

68
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,838
already scored a client.

69
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,190
Client? There isn't a soul here!

70
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,429
I guess it must have been arthur.

71
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,711
Yeah.

72
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,633
Hey, is anybody home?

73
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,033
Just a minute, i'm coming!

74
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,236
Good morning. Are you

75
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,038
the plumber? Joe, right?

76
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,634
Yes ma'm. What's the trouble?

77
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,359
No, thank you. I'm afraid i can't tell you.

78
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,873
Nothing comes out of the faucets,

79
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,188
and yet somehow the basement is flooded.

80
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,236
You tell me.

81
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,435
The whole basement?

82
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,191
And how!

83
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,633
Well, let's take a look.

84
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,359
Ok! Follow me, this way.
Off we go.

85
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,950
I hope it isn't too serious. Watch out,

86
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,234
the stairs are really slippery.

87
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,435
I'm an old sewer rat.

88
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,033
Well, here it is. How long do

89
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,237
you think it will take?

90
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,550
It'll take as long as it takes!

91
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,639
Martha?
I made this little pathway

92
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,429
to the far end just forjoe.

93
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,951
Thank you martha.

94
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,236
Well, i'll go take that look.

95
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,395
Where is arthur?

96
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,952
He is upstairs, tidying up,

97
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,712
we're doing our best to help

98
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,233
yeah, i know. Thank you.

99
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,234
Listen, i'll be going into town later.

100
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,228
Would you please make

101
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,309
me out a list of all the things

102
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,312
we'll need? Ok,
don't worry.

103
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,159
Arthur! What are you doing in my room?

104
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,234
I was looking for keys.

105
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,271
Which keys?

106
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,238
I told ma i was gonna clean up the

107
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,437
rooms but some of them are locked.

108
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,231
Well, ljust have to find those keys,

109
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,231
arthur, won't i? Or else we'll

110
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,232
simply call a locksmith.

111
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,038
In the meantime, could you go up on

112
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,553
the roof and check the chimney?

113
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,235
I think it is clogged.

114
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,589
I heard a car drive up before.

115
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,398
Was it joe?
Yeah. Why??

116
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,637
You are liza, aren't you? Yes.

117
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,678
My name is emily.

118
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,715
I've been looking foryou.

119
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,669
Joe!

120
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,236
Joe!

121
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,235
Joe!

122
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,269
Arthur?

123
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,237
Arthur?

124
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,633
I don't understand, emily.

125
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,630
How do you...

126
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,032
don't worry. I know the way by heart.

127
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,712
And there's always dickey here.

128
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,678
Come liza. I'll show you the way.

129
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,236
Joe?

130
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,236
Emily. Why did you say i must

131
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,231
give up the hotel?

132
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,191
I can't explain it to you.

133
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,238
Just take my word for it.

134
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,231
Go back to where you came from

135
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,038
and hurry.

136
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
What's the matter?

137
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,919
I don't know. He is in amazingly

138
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,115
good condition for a corpse

139
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,838
who is supposed to have been
dead for 6 years.

140
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,353
Well, the d.a. Said to open him up

141
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,031
and see what he had for breakfast.

142
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,235
How about we give it

143
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,799
a try with...
forget it.

144
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,233
You wanna wire this old guy into

145
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,230
your brain wave machine?

146
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,231
Why not?
Okay. Okay.

147
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,833
But you're on your own with this one.

148
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,633
I warn you though. When i get back,

149
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,551
i'm gonna give him an autopsy.

150
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,030
Harris here.

151
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,236
Miller want you up at 24 on the double.

152
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,038
I'm on my way honey.

153
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,238
Wait here for me jill. I won't be long.

154
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,238
Mommy! Mommy!

155
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,236
So, what did you do in the big apple?

156
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,918
Just about everything a girl could do

157
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,319
without losing her good english

158
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,311
breeding and reputation,

159
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,756
modeling, dancing, secretary.

160
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,236
I almost became an unsuccessful

161
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,231
fashion designer.

162
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,230
When this letter arrived

163
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,833
announcing the inheritance.

164
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,114
Big surprise, uh?

165
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,238
More or less. I mean, i knew i had

166
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,639
a rich uncle who was a bachelor

167
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,234
with a lot of real estate

168
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,639
imagined for one day to the next

169
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,278
but i neverthat i'd be running a hotel.

170
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,235
Tell me, with all those accidents,

171
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,878
you know, joe the plumber

172
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,029
and the house painter.

173
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,235
Do you think you'll give up now?

174
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,430
I couldn't do that if i wanted to.

175
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,033
This is my last chance.

176
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,397
Either i run this hotel or i go on relief.

177
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,435
Well i tell you what,

178
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,033
when you get the hotel fixed up,

179
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,632
i'll come and stay there

180
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,119
so you can book me a room now.

181
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,236
Sure, you've got it. The best in

182
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,435
the house.

183
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,034
Of course. How long do you think

184
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,030
it'll be before it's ready?

185
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,031
I don't know, it's driving on so much.

186
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,430
Arthur and martha are more of a

187
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,794
hindrance then a help.

188
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,235
They just can't seem to get it together.

189
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,836
Well, if you hired them,

190
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,636
you can fire them.

191
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,233
But, i can't fire them.

192
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,639
They came with the hotel.

193
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,233
Strange, i've never heard of them.

194
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,235
Dr. Mckay,

195
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,197
dr. Mckay,

196
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,196
you're wanted on the phone.

197
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,235
It's the hospital.

198
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,230
Thank you. Excuse me.

199
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Oh... harris, hi.

200
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,396
What?

201
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,190
...in heaven

202
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,271
give us this day our daily bread

203
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,352
and forgive us ourtrespasses, as we forgive those

204
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,032
who trespass against us.

205
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,237
Lead us not to temptation, but deliver us from evil.

206
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,469
Amen.

207
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,157
...and as we commit the souls of

208
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,037
joe and mary ann, to ourfather

209
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,235
in heaven we pray together,

210
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,230
oh merciful father,

211
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,632
watch overjill, their daughter

212
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,029
whom joe and mary ann's untimely departure

213
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,032
has left alone in this world, as a helpless child

214
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,317
confort her, and guide her, and give her strenght

215
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,791
we ask this, o lord,

216
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,199
in the name of the father and of the son,

217
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,350
and of the holy ghost. Amen.

218
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,638
Courage, my child

219
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,190
liza!

220
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,235
Liza!

221
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,235
Liza!

222
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,197
Emily?

223
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,191
Why didn't you listen to me liza?

224
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,432
We blind see things more clearly.

225
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,988
I wanted to spare you, but now

226
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,036
i'll have to tell you everything.

227
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,635
60 years ago everybody in this

228
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,234
hotel disappeared.

229
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,230
Every last person.

230
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,039
A painter called schweik,

231
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,429
who lived here closeted in his room

232
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,033
had found a key.

233
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,308
What key?
The seven gateways to hell.

234
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,631
This house was constructed

235
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,392
on one of the...

236
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,036
who else is here?
There's nobody here.

237
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,996
I can feel a presence.

238
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,229
Somebody else is in here.

239
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,437
No, emily. Nobody is here.

240
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:57,030
Yes, it's him. He is here again.

241
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,633
He has come back to the hotel.

242
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,235
Get ahold of yourself,

243
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,633
emily, please.
What is this?

244
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,236
That? A painting, just an old painting.

245
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,033
There's the bell.

246
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,674
That's the bell from room 36.

247
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,433
That's where he was killed, in his room!

248
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,318
36 was schweik's room,

249
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,436
the man who found the key.

250
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,239
He has returned, liza.

251
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,469
Don't ever enterthat room.

252
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,835
Now look emily, i've lived in ny

253
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,480
all my life and if there is one thing

254
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,039
i've learned not to believe in it's ghosts.

255
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,032
I was lucky to inherit this hotel.

256
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,031
The first good break i've had.

257
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,839
It'll take more than a faulty electrical

258
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,638
contact or some crazy story to make me

259
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,391
give it up.

260
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:26,233
Emily! Emily! Emily!

261
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,870
Liza!
John!

262
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,873
Hey, hey, calm down, calm down.

263
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,829
Take it easy, take it easy, come on.

264
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,034
But i saw him. There, nailed to the wall.

265
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,996
He...

266
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,033
see these nails.

267
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,236
Well, they certainly look old,

268
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,633
but this seems more like rust

269
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,197
than blood.

270
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,234
Now it seems so impossible, so absurd.

271
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,112
And yet... i don't know.

272
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,634
Now look, come and tell me

273
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,836
exactly what you saw, hmm?

274
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,310
No, never mind. It's useless.

275
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,235
I guess i must have a pretty wild

276
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,958
imagination.
Hmm?

277
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,156
I got carried away with that story

278
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,231
that emily told me about room 36.

279
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,995
Emily? Who's emily?
The blind girl

280
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,035
that lives in the old house

281
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,916
by the crossroads.

282
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,229
There's no blind girl living there.

283
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,116
And i know everyone around here.

284
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,159
The book!
The what?

285
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,029
The book that was on the desk. It's gone!

286
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,672
Open two walls and enterthe basement

287
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,476
and then you'll have a room

288
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,028
for a kitchen and maybe for a laundry.

289
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,916
Huh?

290
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,351
What do you think of that?
Martin,

291
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,429
i've already told you.

292
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,030
I don't have the money.

293
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,639
Do whateveryou want to as long

294
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,039
as it doesn't cost.
I have carte blanche?

295
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,633
Carte blanche, but not a blank check.

296
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,438
Okay? Okay. Well, the

297
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,480
first thing we do is bring someone

298
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,310
in to pump out all the water.

299
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,072
That i can get done real cheap.

300
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,072
And then... oh, and on the other side

301
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,559
i'll make a living room

302
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,914
and a game room. Have you got

303
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,228
the original plans of the cellar by any chance?

304
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:55,951
There was another book here.

305
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,631
A different one.

306
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,759
You wanna buy the book

307
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,193
no, not this one.

308
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,554
The one that was here before,

309
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,551
just a second ago.
That book has

310
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,834
been there fortwo years.

311
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,150
Nobody wants to buy it. It's very

312
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,550
nice though. Very, very interesting.

313
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,032
Liza! What's wrong?

314
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,635
About the book?
I was just looking

315
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,631
for...
what? Is anything the matter?

316
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,835
You look sick.

317
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,639
You're sure
it's nothing?

318
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,835
I'm just a little tired that's all.

319
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,592
I think i'm beginning to see things.

320
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,238
I get the picture. Later i'll have to

321
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,639
go to the town hall and dig out

322
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,630
the originals from the files.

323
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,635
Re-open that hotel? Uh, huh.

324
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,633
Anyway, all the turn of the century

325
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,232
building plans are on those upper

326
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,038
shelves there.

327
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,635
They should be under what

328
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,632
the cards say, m 13,012.

329
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,631
Well, let's get them down and look at them.

330
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,629
You surprised me mr. Avery.

331
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,233
You haven't heard about ourtown

332
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,799
employees latest labor victory?

333
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,632
It tooks three weeks strike to win.

334
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,075
Yeah. It was something about lunch.

335
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,832
An earlier break.

336
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,239
I'm sure you'll be ok on your own.

337
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,232
I'll be out until one or a quarter of.

338
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,639
You feel completely at home now,

339
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,756
you hear?
Have a happy lunch.

340
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,512
Thank you.

341
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,032
I'm gonna lock the door,

342
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,113
that way you won't be disturbed.

343
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,633
First from one to two,

344
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,630
and now from twelve to one.

345
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,039
Three weeks of picketing.

346
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,633
A great labor victory!

347
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,109

00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,832
What the...?!

350
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,794
"The 7 dreaded gateways to hell

351
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,440
are concealed in 7 cursed places."

352
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,633
"And the day the gates of hell are opened,

353
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,359
on that day the dead will walk the earth."

354
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:23,709
Good boy, dicky, good boy.

355
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,434
Who's there? Who's there?

356
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,434
Answer me! I know you're there!

357
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,717
Where are you? Who are you? Who?

358
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,238
I know it's you. I can sense it.

359
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,638
What do you want from me now?

360
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:20,234
What is it now? Schweik, i know you're here.

361
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:37,356
No, no, schweik!

362
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,113
Go away! I don't want to go back!

363
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,079
You can't take me.

364
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,954
I don't want to go back.

365
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,235
Stop tormenting me! Don't get

366
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,073
any closer! Don't get any closer!

367
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:57,429
No! Go away! Leave me in peace.

368
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,036
Don't touch me!

369
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,429
You can't take me back!

370
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,149
I did what i've been asked,

371
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,196
now leave me alone! Go! Go away!

372
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,316
No! I never spoke. You can't

373
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,599
condemn me! I don't want to go back!

374
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,636
Attack dicky! Attack dicky! Attack!

375
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,630
Dicky! Dicky! Don't let them get

376
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:57,640
near me! Attack! Attack! Chase them

377
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:05,069
away! Attack! Get rid of them, dicky!

378
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:12,236
Attack! Dicky! Attack!

379
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:35,996
Good boy.

380
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:44,630
Good boy. Good boy, dicky.

381
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,233
You made them go away.

382
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:32,438
Martha? Arthur? Arthur?

383
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,750
No! No! No!

384
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,554
Stop it! Liza! Liza! Stop it!

385
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,837
Liza, come on, it's me.

386
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,436
Come on, calm down.

387
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,191
Come sit down,

388
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,435
i saw arthur,
come on sit down.

389
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,272
He was dead but...

390
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,915
liza, liza, stop it!

391
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,911
I'm sick of hearing all these stories.

392
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,228
What stories?? Well, like the first one.

393
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,436
There was a man nailed to the wall in room 36.

394
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,238
And the blind girl that doesn't exist.

395
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,757
Emily's real. She does exist. I saw her.

396
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,956
I spoke to her.

397
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,109
The girl that lives in the old house

398
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,428
by the crossroads?
Yes!

399
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,318
That house has been abandoned

400
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,118
forthe last 50 years.

401
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,034
But that's not true. It's not possible.

402
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,793
I was there! I mean i went there.

403
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,438
I was there.

404
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,229
Yes, i know you were there. I found

405
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,356
the book you left for me to read.

406
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,070
You found the book?
And i read it.

407
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:25,154
What did it say?
Show me where is arthur.

408
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:39,434
Here? And he tried to kill you? Huh?

409
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,274
Please john, you must believe me.

410
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,716
I swear.
So where is arthur now?

411
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,236
But i don't know! He attacked me!

412
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,230
I was trying to break free.

413
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,311
He was here!

414
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,793
The cuts on my...
there are no!

415
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:08,310
I must be going crazy.
Perhaps, or else...

416
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:15,115
who are you liza? Who are you really?

417
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,875
John, i don't understand you.

418
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,633
What a question. Why do you ask?

419
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,869
Because according to the book of eibon,

420
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,838
this hotel is one of the

421
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,831
7 gateways to hell.

422
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,238
"And you will face the sea of darkness

423
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,232
and all therein that may be explored."

424
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,238
Strange. There isn't a soul in sight.

425
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,232
Yea. Well, we'll be at the hospital

426
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,719
pretty soon.

427
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,635
I wanna talk to harris.

428
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,032
Where is everybody?

429
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,149
Let's try the laboratory.

430
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,639
But john...
no, liza, i'm a doctor,

431
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,039
and i won't accept irrational explanations

432
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,032
i want to talk to harris.

433
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,235
I'm gonna call the fbi.

434
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,236
John!

435
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,033
The elevator! Get the hell going!

436
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,952
Jill?

437
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,995
Jill!

438
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,035
Jill!

439
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,191
Harris! What the hell is going on

440
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,190
around here?

441
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,874
I don't know. I think i'm going crazy.

442
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,918
Here they come!

443
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,032
It's jill.

444
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,793
She was in the autopsy theater all alone.

445
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,235
This way.

446
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,238
Come on.

447
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,032
Come on.

448
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,235
No!

449
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,229
We're underthe hotel.
Impossible!

450
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,912
It's impossible!
It's crazy.

451
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,238
What's happened? Why are we here?

452
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,633
Come on.

453
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,629
"And you will face the sea of darkness

454
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:14,236
and all therein that may be explored."
