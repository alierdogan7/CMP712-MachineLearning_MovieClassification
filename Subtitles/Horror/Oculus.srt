00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,679

just waiting for an explanation

been strange at times.

with some dark stuff,

181
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,991
I'll never expect you to
understand that part of my life.

day or two more.

to look at it before it ships.

come by the house?

No. The house.

Yes, I have it in front of me.

an hour. Does that work?

He's 21 years old.

It's 4:15pm on October 13th,

and we are at 2705 Hawthorne Way.

273
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,559
I'll begin by detailing my precautions
before I place and uncover the glass.

274
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,279
There are three cameras, each on
its own independent power circuit,

275
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,079
so if any anomalies occur, there
can be a lucid, objective record.

276
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,119
I have private land lines for today's
experiment, along with my cell phone.

277
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,759
And I will now ask my
brother for his phone,

278
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,143
so that I can control
all electronic devices.

279
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,671
I just got this, you know.

280
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,191
Thanks, Timbo.

281
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,559
This alarm is set to go
off every 45 minutes

282
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,799
to remind me to change the
tapes in the cameras.

283
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,479
This alarm is set to go off
hourly to remind us to eat.

284
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,479
And we're fully stocked on
water to prevent dehydration.

285
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
Now, as for the house itself...

286
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,719
each room is fitted with
its own thermostat,

287
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,319
from which data is collected by
software designed to track and record

288
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,959
temperature fluctuations
in hospitals.

289
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,759
Any temperature changes greater than
five degrees in either direction

290
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,839
will set off an alarm.

291
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,639
A third precaution
is also in place,

292
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,919
but I'll get into that
in a few more minutes.

293
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,199
So...

294
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,199
The purpose of today's experiment

295
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,639
is to prove that the object
behind me, the Lasser Glass,

296
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,999
is home to an observable,
predictable supernatural force.

297
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
There's no scientific equivalent
for the word "haunted,"

298
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,399
so we'll just say this object is
responsible for at least 45 deaths

299
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,719
in the four centuries of
its recorded existence...

300
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,959

301
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,183
Don't ever turn off a camera.

00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,266
Sorry.

303
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,319
The origin of the Lasser
Glass is unknown,

304
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,439
so I can't provide a
complete history,

305
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,439
but the trail starts
in London in 1754.

306
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,719
Philip Lasser, the 17th
Earl of Leicester,

307
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,359

it over his fireplace, and...

308
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,159
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Another precaution.

309
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,319
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

310
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,079
Well, I'm checking in,
uh, as requested.

311
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,199
- You all right?
- Everything's fine.

312
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,919
I know this is silly to ask, but
could you try to call on the hour?

313
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,959
It's about seven past.

314
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,959
- Uh... Sure.
- I'll talk to you in 53 minutes.

315
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,759
And I love you.

316
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
I'm expecting regular calls
from my fiance, Michael Dumont.

317
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,399
I told him I'm nervous to be
spending time with my recently

318
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,199
un-incarcerated brother,
with instructions...

319
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,519
- to notify the authorities immediately
- Wow.

320
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,999
if I do not answer the phone.

321
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,839
- In the room.
- Nothing personal.

322
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,759
So, in 1755, Philip Lasser was
found in their grand fireplace.

323
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,719
Burned beyond recognition.
While his estate was dismantled

324
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,439
and scattered throughout
southern England,

325
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,999
one of the family's stewards claimed
to see Philip reflected in the mirror.

326
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,279
An allegation apparently taken
seriously enough to warrant

327
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,319
a Church investigation
into the house.

328
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,439
The glass, thereafter known
as the Lasser Glass,

329
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,119
is sold in public auction in 1758.

330
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,239
The next known owner is an
American rail road tycoon,

331
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,759
named Robert Clancy, 1864.

332
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,239
Clancy apparently weighed
over 300 pounds.

333
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,519
In fact, while attending
university in Connecticut,

334
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,239
he was known as the
South Windham Whale.

335
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,079
He hung the glass in his
ballroom in Atlanta.

336
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,599
Later that year, Robert
Clancy is photographed

337
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,759
by a local newspaper and, uh...

338
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,199
Well, he's dropped a few pounds.

339
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,439
His obit was printed a few weeks later.
Doesn't list a cause of death.

340
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,199
Unfortunately, he and his
estate and the glass

341
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,919
are presumably destroyed in Sherman's
march to the ocean in 1865.

342
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,719
And after that, the glass is lost.

343
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,399
Until it resurfaces in
turn-of-the-century New England.

344
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,079
The next case of note
is Mary O'Connor, 1904.

345
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,799
She hung the mirror in
her private bathroom.

346

The woman died of thirst while soaking
in a full tub for three days.

The next case of note is Alice Carden
in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, 1943.

351

Neighbors reported hearing screams
and loud bangs from the house.

drowned in a locked cistern.

Alice herself was in the nursery,

354
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,879
and both of her legs are
completely shattered.

355
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,359
Her left arm is broken in four places,
and six of her ribs are crushed.

356
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,039
In her right hand is a large hammer she's
been using to break her own bones.

They find her just as she's
going to work on her skull.

Her right arm, though,
is completely unharmed.

359
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,959
Because she needed it.
To wield the hammer.

360

Alice later says she believed she was
tucking the children into their beds

361

as she sealed them
into the cistern.

362

She never recovers
from her injuries.

363
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,559
And, oh, the family kept
several dogs at the farm,

364
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,639

Oliver Jeffries. 1971.

434
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,959
A teacher at Manhattan's
Duhame Academy,

435
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,519
where the mirror hung in
the central lecture hall.

436
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,159
One morning he reportedly ran at
the mirror with a fireplace poker,

437
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,839
shouting about how it
needed to be destroyed,

438
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,279
but he never struck a blow.
According to the students,

439
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,839
he stood there quietly
for almost a minute

440
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,984
before walking out of the
hall and into traffic.

441

defending itself, and...

smash the mirror, Kaylie?

with destruction of property?

Look how it ended up.

Our father was a cheater,
and it drove our mother crazy.

- Stop it.
- He snapped and he killed her.

- He was gonna do the same to us.
- Yeah, a bad marriage.

714
