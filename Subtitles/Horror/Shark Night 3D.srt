00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,551
...I gotta know
what she was gonna say.

511
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,195
If she'd still marry half a man.

512
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,879
Well, let's just worry about getting you
back together and right, OK?

513
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,759
Yeah. Hey, where's she at?

514
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,070
- Where is she?
- She's, she's...

515
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,432
- She what?
- She's...

516
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,629
She what?

517
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,558
She what?!
Look at me, Blake!

518
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,155
Where's Maya?

519
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,718
I'm so sorry.

521
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,679
Hey, man.
We really appreciate your help.

522
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,189
RED: Now.

523
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,598
You just sit back.

524
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,871
And enjoy the view.

525
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,079
I can't stop seeing her face.

526
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,159
I shouldn't have let her on.

527
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,312
You couldn't have stopped her.

528
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,319
I could have jumped in after her.

529
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,473
Nick, don't play this game.

530
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,390
You can't win and trust me,
it never ends.

531
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,798
Why haven't you been back here
for three years?

532
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,791
Every summer, all the little
rich girls around here would

533
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,753
sign up for diving lessons
with Dennis Crim.

534
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,359
He was the hot blonde,
with sensitive blue eyes.

535
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,036
Some kind of teenage fantasy, I guess.

536
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,351
For two summers,
we did everything together.

537
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,190
Then I had to go to college, and
he was never going to leave the water,

538
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,198
so I broke it off.

539
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,629
So a few days
before I was supposed to leave...

540
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,194
...he took me to our favorite
diving spot to say goodbye.

541
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,316
We were only down there
for a few minutes...

542
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,553
...and suddenly I couldn't breathe.

543
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,712
I figured my air gauge was broken,
so I gave him the signal...

544
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,714
...and he just, he just stared at me.

545
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,389
And...

546
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,754
...I reached out to share his air and...

547
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,071
...and he just kind of drifted away.

548
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,589
Jesus.

549
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,077
Somehow I made it to the surface.

550
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,910
And I climbed up to our skiff and...

551
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,998
...I spun around to leave him there and...

552
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,676
...I cut his face open with the propeller.

553
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,115
It was an accident, Sara.

554
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,076
After I took him to the hospital...

555
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,919
...I never went back.

556
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,998
And that was on purpose.

557
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,869
Beth was right, I never should have
brought you guys here.

558
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,789
Hey.

559
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,556
It's gonna be OK.
Sara, we're going to be OK.

560
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,798

to keep this clean, huh?

The shark that got your friend.

570
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,032
How big was it?

571
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,351
I don't know. We didn't see it.

572
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,558
- Must have been a bull.
- Why?

573
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,396
Well, 'cause the bulls, they just wind up
in the damnedest places.

574
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,950
Yeah, a couple years back...

575
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,235
...one went all the way upriver,
wound up in Missouri.

576

That's the Show Me state.

577
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,557
Well, how the hell does it get in a lake?

578
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,917
We had a heavy hurricane season
this year.

579
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,228
My guess is,
maybe one came out of the Gulf,

580
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,478
flooded up over the interstate,
wound up here...

581
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,477
...got comfortable and made a home.

582
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,037

Get out of the water.

588
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,475

Carl.

858
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,875
It's almost dawn.

859
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,513
Wake up the big girl.

860
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,078
It's feeding time.

861
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,789
CARL: Copy that.

862
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,037
(CHUCKLING)

863
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,070
Hundreds of millions of years of evolution
perfected these babies.

864
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,033
They can smell a single drop of blood...

865
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,875
...in a body of water
the size of an Olympic swimming pool.

866
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,439
No!

867
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,228
You don't have to do this.
Sabin, this can't be worth it!

868
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,794
It's worth it, man. Yeah, it's worth it.

869
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,515
I'm willing to give up my position
as lowly janitor on the lake.

870
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,957
I let someone else get shat on by rich
college punks for 12 bucks an hour, man,

871
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,196
I see it. Whoo-hoo!

872
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,198
"Retard sheriff."
"I can buy and sell you."

873
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,992
Well, I bought you, Nick.

874
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,391
And I own you.
So now I'm going to sell you.

875
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,676
No. No!

876
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,119
No!

877
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,238
(GRUNTING)

878
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,674
Oh, yeah.

879
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,756
Come on, just pretend it's a carnival.

880
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,356
It's like a big old dunk tank
with a twist.

881
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,994
Please. (GRUNTING)

882
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,793
(SCREAMING)

883
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,872
Oh, yeah...

884
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,029
...psych.

- (ROCK MUSIC ON RADIO)

886
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,279
Yeah.

887
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,230
Hey, Nick. You know,
you're 15 times more likely

888
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,828
to get killed by a falling coconut
than a shark?

889
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,472
Fifty times more likely to get crushed
by a falling soda machine, man.

890
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,872
Think of it this way, Nick,
you're beating some weird-ass odds.

891
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,797
Whoo!

892
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,712
Heavy metal music, man, I'm a fan.
Guilty as charged.

893
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,470
Yeah, I love the old big hair metal.

894
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,950
I'd wear leather pants on the force
if they'd let me,

895
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,993
but if there's something you'd rather
listen to while you're dying,

896
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,394
the sheriff takes requests.

897
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,278
How about some Guns and Roses?

898
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,999
What was that?

899
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,158
- Guns and Roses, Sheriff.
- I know what you're trying to do.

900
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,835
You're making me love you. All right!

901
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,998
It's working, yeah! Whoo!

902
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,951
Happens to be my favorite.

903
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,994
(SABIN SCREAMING)

904
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,438
Come on, man! Oh, don't, Nick!

905
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,398
Dennis, no, please,
you don't have to do this.

906
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,273
Please, no.

907
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,038
We had some good times, Sara.

908
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,635
SARA: What are you doing?
What are you going to do?

909
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,829
It's a shame.

01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,234
Dennis. Dennis, please
let me out of here.

912
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,118
- Dennis!
- NICK: Bring her up!

913
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,675
- Nick!
- Bring her up.

914
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,353
Come on, Dennis.

915
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,513
Dennis. This ain't funny.

916
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,475
OK. All right.

917
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,109
Hey, Sara, looks like your lucky day.

918
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,551
- SARA: Nick.
- Your white knight is here.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

920
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,910
You want to play poker, son,
you better know what you're holding.

921
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,354
Hang on, Sara.

922
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,829
SARA: Nick.

923

924
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,315
Behind you.

Good boy, Sherman.
