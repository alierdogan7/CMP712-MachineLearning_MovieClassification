1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,125
(wind whistling)

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,118
(thunder rumbling)

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,964
(rain pattering)

4
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,387
(man coughing)

5
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,772
(thunder rumbling)

6
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
Where are we?

7
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,827
Hey, Henson, give me the map.

8
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,161
Huh?

9
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,452
The map... give me the map.

10
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,167
HENSON:
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

11
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,042
You need help?

12
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,131
Yeah... no, I got it.
I'm fine.

13
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
(coughs)
I'm all right.

14
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,843
Hang in there.

15
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,511
All right.

16
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,274
I think we passed through
Winchester a week ago.

17
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,686
We headed south,
using Route 2.

18
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,105
If we're averaging
20 miles a day...

19
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,115
Right? 20 miles? You think
we're doing 20 miles a day?

20
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,368
I don't think
it's that much, with him.

21
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,325
Well, that would put us

22
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,535
somewhere around here then,
in this shit.

23
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,292
What am I missing here, Rick?

24
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,203
Look, this small ridge

25
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,917
about five miles
west of here

26
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,550
and over those hills
with the river running parallel...

27
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,383
rocky terrain
provides protection;

28
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,718
the river provides
a water source.

29
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,803
It's a perfect place
for them.

30
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,139
(Henson coughing)
Oh, yeah, we should go there then.

31
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,303
Let's pick up the pace.

32
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,771
Quietly.

33
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,935
Let's go.

34
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,527
ADAM:
Rick, this is fucking bullshit.

35
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,163
There's no way in hell we're doing this.
This is a bad idea.

36
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,574
(Henson coughing)

37
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,743
What are you thinking?

38
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,504
What am I thinking?
Okay...

39
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,007
those storm clouds
are coming back

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,090
and I'm worried about
Henson getting soaked.

41
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,380
Hey, don't fucking bring me
into this, man.

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,265
- You can't even stand.
- He's right.

43
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,597
We're cornering ourselves.

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,060
Yeah, well, this is not
about us, Adam.

45
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,526
- Fuck this, Rick.
SHANNON: - Adam, please stop.

46
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,108
ADAM: - Oh, so I don't get a say?
RICK: - Enough already.

47
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,121
(thunder rumbling)

48
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,585
(doorknob rattling)

49
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,800
(door squeaks)

50
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,310
(wind whistling)

51
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,071
No tracks.

52
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,417
That's a start.

53
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,755
(knocks)

54
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,066
Let's go, kid.

55
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,009
(Rick clicks tongue)

56
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,898
And a basement.

57
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,161
Flashlight.

58
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,869
Anything?

59
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,709
Clear.

60
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,505
(thunder crashing)

61
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,466
(Henson coughing)

62
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,966
Hey.

63
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,227
Just relax, okay?

64
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,387
Relax.

65
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,397
Lie down.

66
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,682
Okay?

67
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,897
(Henson groans)
- Keep warm.

68
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,564
Oh, man.
Do I get a bedtime story, too?

69
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,233
Oh, sure.
Once upon a time

70
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,572
there was an idiot
called Henson.

71
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,658
(Henson chuckles)

72
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,703
Look, I don't like
this place at all.

73
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,746
It seems like
no one has been

74
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,462
in or around here
for a long time,

75
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,501
which is good.

76
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,217
So we rest, we stay dry

77
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,679
and get the hell out
as soon as the rain lets up.

78
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,095
Inventory. Sound off.

79
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,138
(scoffs)

80
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,229
Well, I'm still at nine.

81
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,519
15.

82
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,531
I am at eight and three.

83
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,195
Ooh, that is hot.

84
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,449
Kid?

85
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,744
RICK:
Only six.

86
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,960
41 rounds total.

87
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,251
Not too good.

88
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,793
How are my babies?

89
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,962
(Shannon clears throat)

90
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,145
HENSON: Dude, you're getting
way too creepy with those seeds.

91
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,180
Next you'll be naming them.

92
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,147
I already have...
Hope and Faith.

93
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,481
Oh, my God,
you're serious, aren't you?

94
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,618
Mock if you will,
but these are our future,

95
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,323
once we find
a nice place.

96
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,829
Jesus Christ, Rick.

97
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,243
Do me a favor, man.
Not today.

98
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,504
Adam, Adam.

99
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,836
Hey, Adam, hold on.

100
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,001
So what's cooking?

101
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,349
This is the last of the dried rabbit
that we traded for.

102
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,185
And we've got two more

103
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,816
of these mystery suckers left.
That's it.

104
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,362
Guys, we need to find
more food.

105
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,036
(thunder rumbling)

106
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,217
(crying)

107
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,491
Hey!

108
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,077
Do you think Susan is dead?

109
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,752
(thunder rumbling)

110
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,756
Susan Markunis
from high school?

111
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,463
You still think about her?

112
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,887
No.

113
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,644
Remember...
(laughs)

114
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,680
remember her and Jenny
at the lake?

115
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,724
Holy shit.
Do you remember that?

116
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,767
Of course.

117
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,312
Oh, man.

118
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,948
It feels like years ago now.

119
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,780
Well, it was.

120
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,866
You think she's dead?
You think Susan's dead...

121
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,532
all these people,

122
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,700
all our friends?

123
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,383
Do I think they're dead?

124
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,919
Yeah. I mean,
is it just us now?

125
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,508
I fucking know they're dead.

126
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,977
You know, she was nice.

127
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,139
She had those...

128
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,650
(clears throat)

129
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,856
HENSON: Susan was a bitch
to you, Rick.

130
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,397
Everybody knew that
but you.

131
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,532
She was a bitch.

132
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
Thank you.

133
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,325
You know,

134
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,835
it's weird, thinking about it.

135
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,995
Yeah, don't.

136
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,262
(thunder crashing)

137
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,097
(shivers)

138
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,495
(Adam's voice)
So, preference?

139
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,419
WOMAN: Well, anything
that still has a front door

140
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,128
is always a good sign.

141
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,259
(brakes squeal)

142
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,921
Hey, it's gonna be fine,
just like it always is.

143
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,966
Five minutes, no more.
Watch the clock.

144
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,432
The safety's off.
It's fully loaded.

145
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,432
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

146
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,976
ADAM: Lock the doors.
I'll be right back.

147
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,987
Two honks
if you see anything.

148
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,613
Yes, yes, yes, Yes, yes...

149
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,909
- No!
(glass shatters)

150
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,043
(two honks)
(gunshot)

151
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,500
(screaming)

152
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,422
(panting)

153
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,257
No!

154
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,175
No!

155
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,100
(quietly)
Make a wish.

156
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,610
I know. It's okay.

157
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,523
It's okay.

158
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,638
Nice day, huh?

159
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,450
Burning gold there.
What are we celebrating?

160
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,281
I know.

161
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,162
Might as well be today.

162
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,750
I know everybody's pretty much
lost somebody...

163
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,755
Don't.

164
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,881
I just need to know.

165
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,466
I just wait to die.

166
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,222
Okay?

167
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,930
Yeah.

168
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,820
We shouldn't stay here.

169
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,746
(door opens)

170
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,919
Come on, get this off me.

171
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,301
Hey, Henson, get some water.

172
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,304
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, man.

173
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,136
HENSON: - Thanks, man.
- Are you all right?

174
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,596
I'm burning
from the inside out.

175
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,891
I've had worse
hangovers, though.

176
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,931
You ready to get
the fuck out of here?

177
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,270
Yeah, I'm ready.

178
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,811
All right, here, get your shirt.

179
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,604
We've been here too long.

180
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,398
It's time to start moving again.
There you go.

181
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,659
He's not going anywhere.
You look terrible.

182
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,364
Sorry, baby, but you do.

183
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,200
- The skies are clearing.
- You hear what I said?

184
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,661
He can't even barely stand up.
What, are we gonna leave him here?

185
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,166
We're sitting ducks right now.
We got to go.

186
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,952
RICK:
Adam, stop, all right?

187
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,496
Jesus, if he can't walk,
it won't matter if we stay or go.

188
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,132
- Hey, I can manage. Let's go.
- That's right. He can manage.

189
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,213
Wait, not at the speed
that you need to.

190
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,049
RICK:
We stay the night.

191
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,179
When was the last time we had
a roof over our heads anyway?

192
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,840
ADAM: Hey.

193
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,054
We have a protocol, right?

194
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,642
Right. And what's more
important right now, Adam? Hope...

195
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,023
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.

196
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,525
We got to go,
and we got to go right now.

197
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,354
There's no discussion.
We stay

198
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,068
until Henson is
strong enough again.

199
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,359
- Okay, okay.
- We make use of the light.

200
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,653
Adam and I will salvage
what we can from the house.

201
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,823
Ladies, you're on trapping duty.

202
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,160
(groans)

203
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,410
Fuck.

204
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,501
It's pointless,
and you know it.

205
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,166
It is not pointless.

206
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,506
Haven't even heard a fucking
bird chirp in over two years.

207
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,386
If you got anything more to say,
now's the time.

208
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,055
ADAM: Hey, man,
I've already said it,

209
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,939
but we've always agreed
it was your call.

210
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,396
Oh, but this isn't
about that, is it?

211
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,412
(wood creaking)

212
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,039
ADAM: Hello?

213
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,575
RICK:
Yep, I'm listening.

214
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,915
Rick, come here.

215
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,677
Oh, my God.

216
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,605
Can you at least try to pretend
to look for tracks?

217
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,117
You know what?
Now don't get me wrong,

218
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,533
you can definitely handle yourself
with that thing,

219
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,576
but since you hooked up
with us,

220
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,745
you barely said a word.

221
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,794
Those three guys back there...
they grew up together.

222
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,633
That's how they've managed
to stay tight through this shit.

223
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,470
And I've been riding
with them since,

224
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,306
I don't know, back when
there were 12 of us.

225
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,647
Now I get it, you're into this
whole lone wolf thing, yeah.

226
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,683
That's fine.

227
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,943
But maybe it would help
overall morale

228
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,524
if you just interjected yourself
just once in a while,

229
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,985
said something... anything.

230
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,901
I mean, what is going on?

231
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,655
We're a family.

232
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,374
Either be part of it or don't.

233
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,539
Do you understand?

234
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,254
That's what I thought.

235
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,181
What the fuck is this?

236
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,857
Hope and Faith, buddy.

237
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,363
Henson, you got to come
take a look at this.

238
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,864
Really?

239
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,283
A dirty-ass basement?

240
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,129
I hate fucking surprises, man.

241
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,881
Don't fucking surprise me
with bullshit.

242
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,757
- Oh, you don't like surprises?
- What you got, man?

243
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,793
RICK: All right,

244
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,553
surprise.

245
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,055
(Adam chuckles)
- Oh.

246
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,557
- Look at that shit.
- Fuck me, man.

247
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,970
We got food?
Oh, we got food, man.

248
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,559
Lots of food. Look at this...
corned beef. We got sardines.

249
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,022
Tuna fish. What do you like?
What do you like?

250
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,732
I like it all, man.
Oh, I like it all.

251
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,193
(Chuckling)
- Let's do it.

252
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,613
(water running)

253
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,624
(Henson coughing)
Oh, shit.

254
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,758
RICK: - Are you all right, man?
- Yeah.

255
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,136
Are you strong enough
to carry this upstairs?

256
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,422
HENSON:
Whatever I carry, I eat.

257
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,841
(Rick laughs)
That's the spirit.

258
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,305
Plenty to go around.

259
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,231
(rustling)

260
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,156
(rustling)

261
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,350
RICK:
Four cans of tuna.

262
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,359
HENSON: I'm gonna bite a hole
in one of these cans in a minute.

263
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,690
RICK:
Seven cans of tuna, okay.

264
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,106
Fuck this. I'm hungry.
I'm not waiting.

265
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,195
- Oh, yeah. I'm not waiting.
- Boys, I got to tell you,

266
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,655
I think staying here
was the right call.

267
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,195
What's this?

268
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,535
Rocks? Who the fuck
would put rocks in here?

269
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,002
Rick!

270
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,082
No. No!

271
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,249
Hey! Oh, shit.

272
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,044
No!

273
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,962
(alarm ringing)
- What the fuck is that?

274
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,006
Henson! Henson!

275
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,685
What happened?

276
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,891
What the fuck
is that ringing?

277
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,897
(ringing continues)

278
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,058
Are there more?

279
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,354
There will be.

280
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,731
(alarm ringing)
ADAM: - I got you.

281
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,946
- I got you. It's okay. It's okay.
HENSON: - We're fucked, Adam!

282
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,736
Henson! Henson, I need you.
Henson!

283
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,533
HENSON: We're locked in.
Adam, we're locked in.

284
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,201
Fuck. Okay.
You're okay.

285
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,540
Henson! Henson!

286
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,421
Henson, hey!

287
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,049
Oh, fuck.
He's bleeding everywhere.

288
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,711
I can't stop the bleeding.

289
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,424
Fuck.

290
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,885
It's okay. It's okay.
Fuck, man.

291
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,892
They fucking got him.
Shit.

292
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,224
(ringing continues)

293
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,458
- He's... he's gone.
- Oh, no.

294
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,551
Rick! Adam!

295
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,303
Guys!

296
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,309
Help! Help!
Let us out of here!

297
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,226
- Get us the fuck out!
- What the fuck is this?

298
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,521
- Guys, can you hear me?
- We're fucked.

299
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,984
- Guys?
(Henson shouting)

300
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,116
What? I can't hear you.
Is Rick okay?

301
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,403
No, he's not okay. He's dead.
We need you to get us out of here.

302
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,280
Shannon, help!

303
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,823
Fuck.

304
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,334
Fuck. No.

305
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,835
Adam, get over here.
I need the light.

306
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,122
- Fuck! Fuck.
- Get over here, Adam.

307
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,461
(Shannon banging)
No.

308
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,501
Shit!

309
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,055
Hey. Hey, Shannon.

310
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,966
- Shannon.
- Huh?

311
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,012
Is there a mechanism or a lever
that might open the door?

312
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,021
I can't find anything.
There's nothing here.

313
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,682
You've got to hurry, Adam.

314
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,646
That ringing
is gonna fucking bring them.

315
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,812
Shannon, Shannon,
you got to go, okay?

316
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,651
You got to go right now.

317
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,657
I'm not gonna leave you here.
Fuck.

318
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,780
We can't be here
when they come.

319
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,448
Fuck you.

320
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,459
Go save your own
fucking skin.

321
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,211
They're my family.

322
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,543
I'll kill every last one of them myself.
I don't give a shit.

323
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,549
No, you'll die quickly.

324
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,382
I'm not scared of them.
I'm not scared of them.

325
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,763
Let's assume there are
a dozen more of these places

326
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,971
spread all over
this countryside.

327
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,885
The bell is a signal.

328
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,225
They'll have an efficient way
of checking their traps.

329
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,980
Oh, God, scouts.

330
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,392
Right.

331
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,859
We can handle this.

332
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,154
It's up to them, okay?

333
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,786
Okay. Okay.

334
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:18,637
(ringing stops)
(door opens and closes)

335
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,518
(footsteps)

336
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,991
What if they can't do it?

337
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,617
They will.

338
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,699
Fuckers.

339
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,336
Wait for it.

340
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,650
- Hello, meat.
- No, fuck you.

341
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,810
How is it going, fucker?

342
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,149
- Relax.
- Fuck you. You relax.

343
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,689
(gun clicks)

344
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,448
Why don't you get a hot one
in your head right now?

345
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,449
I'm not even sure
you have bullets.

346
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,951
We got something cooking
for your ass.

347
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,828
Come down here so I can bust
your fucking ass.

348
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,786
Come down here, all of you.
Come down!

349
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,325
MAN:
Kitchen clear.

350
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,994
- Fuck you. Come join the party, bitch.
MAN 2: - Upstairs clear.

351
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,834
ADAM: - Keep it down, man.
HENSON: - I got it, man.

352
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,340
- Do you have the date?
- Fuck you.

353
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,008
Give me your friend.

354
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,674
Hey, fuck you.
Fuck you!

355
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,683
Just give me your friend.

356
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,844
We can catch you guys
another time.

357
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,855
Look, I got another offer
for you, asshole, okay?

358
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,813
Why don't you guys walk out of here and
settle for each other's dicks tonight?

359
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,694
- That's what you do.
- You're all the same, you know.

360
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,278
You all think
you're different.

361
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,033
You're not.

362
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,695
You're just dying
faster than we are.

363
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,740
- Fuck you. Shut up.
(sighs) Fine.

364
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,750
Have it your way.
We got supplies.

365
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,584
We can wait for days,
or hours, by the look of you.

366
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,293
No, fuck waiting.
Come down here.

367
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,676
Come down.
I'll bust your fucking ass.

368
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,462
(gurgling)

369
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,410
HENSON: I'm gonna shoot one
of these motherfuckers, man.

370
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,241
Come on.
Are you running, bitch?

371
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,872
Fucking running, huh?

372
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,575
(screaming)

373
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,423
(screams)

374
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,380
HENSON: Shannon! Shannon,
what's going on up there?

375
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,012
What the fuck is going on?

376
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,767
(floor creaks)
- Get her!

377
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,604
ADAM:
Hey! Hey!

378
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,657
(grunts)

379
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,503
You're certainly a pretty piece.

380
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,444
I see.

381
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,205
I see you.

382
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,334
You think you can use
our place...

383
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,962
our place...

384
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,543
to trap all this meat

385
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,674
and not share?

386
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,835
Shut up. Shut up.

387
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,505
Greedy, greedy.

388
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,017
There's enough
to go around, you know.

389
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,144
We'll be back

390
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,522
soon...

391
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,402
to take what's ours.

392
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,536
So stupid.

393
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,204
- Are you okay?
- Rifle, now.

394
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,654
(Gasping)

395
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,317
You guys all right?

396
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,911
(grunts)

397
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,911
(woman panting)

398
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,345
(rustling)

399
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,140
(rustling)

400
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,351
(giggling)

401
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,441
(alarm bell ringing)
(gasps)

402
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,260
- Daddy, Daddy.
(gunshot)

403
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,307
Tell you what.

404
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,568
Let's go get the others, huh?

405
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,898
Yeah.

406
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,815
Come on, get on.

407
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,447
You're getting big.

408
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,547
Everybody, gather up.

409
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,677
(grunts)

410
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,359
We need to talk.

411
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,368
SHANNON: Fuck it.

412
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,701
Smoke her and let's get out of here.
There's got to be more of them coming.

413
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,116
No, no, no, just wait.
Wait a minute.

414
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,536
Who the fuck are you, huh?

415
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,622
Huh?

416
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,133
SHANNON:
I know who she is.

417
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,089
You're one of them.
Isn't that right?

418
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,381
This whole fucking time.

419
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:01,182
Is it true?
Are you one of them?

420
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,722
SHANNON: Yes.

421
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,061
Let her say it.
Hold on.

422
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,726
Is that fucking right?

423
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,774
Henson, we don't have time
for this shit.

424
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,818
She's one of them
and I'll prove it to you.

425
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,908
Just shoot her
if she tries anything.

426
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,414
Where is it? Huh?

427
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,286
There it is.

428
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,876
Is that your mark?

429
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,126
HENSON: Oh, fuck.
Oh, this fucking bitch.

430
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,342
So allies to her clan
won't touch her.

431
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,097
But cleverly hidden,
isn't it?

432
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,429
So you can infiltrate
people like us.

433
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,764
You piece of shit.

434
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,393
Did you bring us here
on purpose?

435
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,028
Did you fucking bring us
into this trap?

436
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,612
SHANNON: - Fuck yeah, she did.
HENSON: - This is bullshit.

437
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,072
Bided her fucking time, too.
Didn't you?

438
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,578
That's for Rick, you cunt.

439
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,745
HENSON: I can't believe this shit.
I don't fucking believe it.

440
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,464
Why did she kill
all those others, huh?

441
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,627
If she's one of them,
why would she do that?

442
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,670
Maybe it's what that
sick fuck said...

443
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,056
she wanted us for herself.
I don't know.

444
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,845
I don't think there's any common
loyalty between those fucks.

445
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,637
If they aren't in her clan,

446
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,102
they're fucking hamburger
meat just the same.

447
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,517
Am I right, sweetheart?
You can jump in anytime.

448
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,061
Well, why didn't she kill us
fucking weeks ago, huh?

449
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,946
Don't you think
she would have did that?

450
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,151
I don't fucking know, Henson.

451
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,442
Just fucking kill her
and let's get out of here.

452
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,114
You helped us. Why?

453
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,830
(coughing)
Huh? Fucking why?

454
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,131
Well, say something.

455
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,377
Okay.

456
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,172
(gun clicks)

457
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,591
You fucking say something.

458
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,058
Anything.

459
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,436
(screams)

460
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,943
Adam. Adam,
just finish her off already.

461
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,608
Adam. Adam!

462
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,991
Come on.

463
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,619
(panting)
No.

464
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,702
Just finish her.

465
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,709
Not so quickly.
No mercy for her.

466
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,495
No mercy.

467
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,208
God damn it, Adam,
please, let's go, man.

468
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,419
We have time for this.

469
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,755
- No, we don't have time...
- We have time for this!

470
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,045
We have time for this!

471
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,213
No, we fucking don't have time!

472
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,178
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

473
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,342
(grunts)

474
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,062
I've seen how you operate.

475
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,066
You don't kill quickly.

476
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,916
You make your prey
walk back to the camp

477
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,419
so you can process
them properly.

478
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,259
It's easier.

479
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,092
It's cleaner.
It's more efficient.

480
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,810
Is that what you did
to my wife and daughter?

481
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,603
Did you make them walk?

482
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,440
Come on, Adam,
let's get out of here.

483
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,530
Hey, go ahead if you want.

484
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,411
It's already too fucking late.
They're already on their way.

485
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,823
There's nothing around here
for miles.

486
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,208
They'll track us down in less
than a day. You're already dead.

487
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,788
We all are.

488
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,136
So, with what little time
I have left,

489
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,673
I want to spend with you.

490
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,841
Okay?

491
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,440
How did you kill them, huh?

492
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,475
Was it like it used to be
with cows,

493
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,067
just like a quick blow to the head?
(whimpering)

494
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,448
Or...

495
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,654
did you...
did you torture them?

496
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,289
Did you...
did you cut my little baby up?

497
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,328
Did you cut her up
before you cooked her?

498
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,168
Is that what you did?

499
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,506
I... I didn't kill your family.

500
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,421
But you're part of them.

501
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,840
So you're responsible.

502
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,305
It means you chose
to be like them.

503
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,844
You chose to do it.

504
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,140
I... I chose to live.

505
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,524
No.

506
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,186
You chose to murder.

507
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,780
Come on, God damn it, Adam.
That's enough.

508
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,781
(whimpering)

509
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,614
No.

510
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,711
No, please.

511
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,087
No.

512
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,044
When my baby...

513
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,176
(sobbing)
- ...was first eating soft food...

514
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,757
she used to love this.

515
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,388
(screams)

516
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,386
Adam, what are you doing, man?
Come on.

517
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,976
Open up for the airplane.
Come on.

518
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,018
(Imitates engine)
(groans)

519
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,984
Open up. Open up.
Open up for the airplane.

520
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,240
Open your fucking mouth!

521
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,864
No?

522
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,450
Adam, just get on with it.

523
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,956
Shit.

524
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,411
I guess we're gonna have
to find something

525
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,248
a little more appetizing, huh?

526
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,586
Have you ever wondered
what your heart looks like?

527
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,766
Yes!

528
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,305
Yes, Yes, yes!

529
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,145
Yes, fucking kill me!

530
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,937
Kill me, please!

531
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,105
Please.

532
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,820
Please just... just cut me up

533
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,155
and leave me to rot, please.

534
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,537
Please.

535
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,198
I know what I am.

536
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,914
And I fucking deserve it.
I fucking do.

537
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,922
You're goddamn right!
You're goddamn right, you do.

538
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,458
Then just do it!

539
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,186
She was just...
she was just six.

540
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,598
She was just six.
She was so fucking little.

541
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,283
Today was her birthday.

542
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,201
Adam, I didn't kill
your daughter.

543
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,790
You all did.

544
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,172
You all killed her.

545
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,003
And I'm gonna make you pay.

546
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,339
I'm gonna make you pay
for everybody.

547
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,004
I was trying to survive.

548
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,551
What the hell
are you doing?

549
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,685
HENSON:
Yeah, man.

550
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,267
What are you doing,
Adam, huh?

551
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,808
What are you fucking
doing, man?

552
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,693
This is justice.

553
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,531
Is that what this is?

554
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,947
Huh?

555
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,987
Put the knife down, brother,

556
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,872
and back away from her.

557
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,035
Put it down.
(coughing)

558
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,328
Put it down.

559
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,997
So you're on her side now?

560
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,134
No.

561
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,045
I love you, man,

562
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,557
but I'm not gonna sit here
and let you butcher her like that.

563
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,850
That's the difference
between them and us.

564
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,232
But if you want to kill her,
let's get it over with.

565
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,525
We got to get
the fuck out of here.

566
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,864
(Henson coughing)

567
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,583
(gun clicks)

568
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,210
God damn you all.

569
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:54,219
I didn't lead you here.

570
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,255
I don't care.

571
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,393
I didn't miss.

572
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,404
I didn't miss.

573
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,610
- Don't.
- Adam.

574
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,616
- Say it, Adam.
- Don't.

575
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,697
Don't you fucking dare.

576
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,163
Say the fucking word.
Say it.

577
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,459
I had a little sister,

578
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,249
12 years old.

579
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:39,005
She fell and broke her leg,

580
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,593
bad.

581
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,311
Twisted bone
sticking out,

582
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,188
too fragmented
to just reset.

583
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,027
She would slow us down
and die of infection in a week.

584
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:01,077
Maybe they couldn't heal her.

585
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,616
But she was one of our own.

586
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,462
They strung her up...

587
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,344
and slit her throat.

588
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,300
They drank and bottled her blood
as it poured out of her.

589
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,889
They cooked and ate
her major organs that night.

590
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,402
Three nights later I stabbed them
all to death in their sleep.

591
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,412
Look, it doesn't change
what I once was.

592
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,045
I know that.

593
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:56,959
If you want to take me out
in that field

594
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,219
and put a bullet in my head,
I won't resist.

595
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,255
I promise.

596
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,514
But he's right.

597
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,980
They are coming.

598
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,069
And you won't last two days in the open
country if they're tracking you.

599
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,649
You either have to split up and run
or you make a stand here.

600
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,535
What makes you think
we'll last here?

601
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,946
You probably won't,

602
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,990
but you have a better chance.

603
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,126
You have fortification

604
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,457
and you know
they're on their way.

605
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,503
And...

606
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,713
you have me.

607
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,307
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

608
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,642
What the fuck do you think
I want to do, hmm?

609
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,183
I want to kill them all.

610
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,322
(hammering)

611
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,173
You want to bandage that up
with something?

612
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,212
It won't matter.

613
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,098
Won't this piss them off
even more?

614
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,054
At least they'll know
who they're fucking with.

615
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,440
We're all gonna die,
you know.

616
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,853
And frankly, I think
it's too easy for you.

617
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,989
Maybe you can
prove me wrong.

618
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,397
You're missed, old friend.

619
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,955
If we weren't sure before,
they'll certainly be coming now.

620
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,911
It's better that than to have them
dig him up and make a meal.

621
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,587
Don't you pretend like
he meant anything to you.

622
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,090
He was a good leader.

623
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,597
This world has existed

624
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,102
for over 10 years now.

625
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,057
There was
enough shit and blood,

626
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,272
starvation and death
in that first year

627
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,436
to fill a hundred lifetimes.

628
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,578
Nine friends have died before us,
died protecting us,

629
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,909
and now we're all that's left.

630
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,791
It would be a fucking insult to them
if we lied down like dogs

631
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,045
and let these fucking animals
take us so easily.

632
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,501
(hammering)

633
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,258
I hope they send
100 of those sick fucks.

634
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,421
Means more for us to kill
and less of them left in this world.

635
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:34,763
So tonight I'm fighting for you
and you,

636
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,099
'cause you're my family now.

637
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,560
And I fear for all the soulless
pieces of shit

638
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,441
that try to get into
this house tonight.

639
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,826
I don't know
why we're trusting her.

640
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,542
She's not lying about wanting to kill
the ones coming for us,

641
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,045
whatever her reasons may be.

642
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,380
And, shit, we need the muscle.

643
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,045
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

644
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,806
She ain't gonna survive the night
one way or another.

645
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,186
Are you with me?

646
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,099
Yeah.

647
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,142
HENSON:
Great speech, buddy.

648
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,028
It even trumps the one
you gave at Gilford

649
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,815
our senior year
in the semifinals.

650
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,131
If I remember,
we lost to Gilford.

651
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,849
It's getting late.
We need to get ready.

652
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,791
Don't worry.

653
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,587
They're gonna pay
for what they've done.

654
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,221
And then we'll eat.

655
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,809
Look to this day,

656
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,603
where yesterday
has been a dream

657
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,365
and tomorrow
only a vision,

658
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,493
and every tomorrow

659
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,824
a vision of hope.

660
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,836
We know there is
at least one gun.

661
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:53,382
Find out what else
we're up against.

662
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,542
Go.

663
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:13,103
You look, you listen,

664
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,521
and then you learn.

665
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,190
And one day you will lead.

666
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,359
Go now.

667
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,863
Your brother is gonna be
very strong one day.

668
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,709
But you, my darling,

669
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,211
are gonna be
so much stronger.

670
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,835
(gun clicks)

671
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,878
What have we got?

672
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,390
Hard to see.
More than 20.

673
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:45,722
(Henson coughing)
- Fuck.

674
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,182
We're in for one hell
of a night, y'all.

675
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,894
Save your bullets
as a last resort.

676
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,228
This is our last resort.

677
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,610
Locked and loaded.
Let the countdown begin.

678
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,191
Hey, take these.
I don't believe in redemption

679
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,027
for someone like you,
but if you...

680
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,691
fuck.

681
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,911
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

682
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,744
Save those fucking
bullets, man.

683
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,005
(grunting)

684
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,275
Bring me

685
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,936
their heads.

686
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,156
Now!

687
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,455
There's more coming at us.
Come on.

688
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,915
Come on, you fuckers.

689
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,954
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

690
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,544
- They're in for a treat now.
- Make 'em count, every one.

691
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,335
Come on. Come on
and get some, bitch, come on.

692
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,766
Get some, come on.
Five bullets down, two dead.

693
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,596
God damn it,
Adam, your window!

694
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,399
I got four that ain't us, Adam.
They're heading your way, man.

695
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,479
Got them coming
around the back.

696
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,581
(man screams)

697
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,593
Henson!

698
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,641
Henson!

699
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,580
(panting)

700
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,204
(Henson coughing)

701
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,589
Adam.

702
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,505
HENSON:
God damn it.

703
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,295
Get him some water.
Get him some water.

704
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,302
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

705
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,341
- Hurry up.
- Feels like I ran back-to-back

706
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,227
marathons up a hill
with pneumonia

707
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,559
with these fucking freaks
chasing me, man.

708
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,099
Get some rest.
Get some rest.

709
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,688
What's the count at?

710
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,229
I just got three.
God damn it.

711
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,989
I got six in the pistol,
four in the rifle.

712
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,367
- I'm still at three.
- Mary.

713
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,327
- Mary.
- Five.

714
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,365
Five. All right. I'm gonna cover
for your lazy ass, all right?

715
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,579
Cover for mine.

716
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,215
You, you and you...

717
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,842
you have to find
your way inside.

718
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,503
We're not going anywhere.

719
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,764
I need someone to get up there quietly
and find out how many there really are.

720
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,471
Knock on the front door,
go through the goddamn window...

721
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,728
I don't care.
Do it now and do it fast.

722
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,889
Go.

723
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:30,610
They're gonna come again,
harder and in full force.

724
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:31,948
No shit, genius.

725
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,454
(coughing)

726
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,785
What the fuck
are you looking at, huh?

727
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,837
Don't you fucking
look at me.

728
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,124
Don't you ever fucking look
at me again, you hear me?

729
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,463
Don't you fucking look at me
fucking ever!

730
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,424
Shannon, cover the window.

731
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,963
You fucking hear me?

732
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,382
I wasn't fucking talking to you.

733
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,765
- Fuck you.
- Shannon, come on.

734
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,804
We got a bigger fight.
Stop.

735
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,596
I say we send her out there

736
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,391
to hold them over while we
fucking get the fuck out of here.

737
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,809
What the fuck
is wrong with you guys?

738
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,977
- Shannon, stop, God damn it.
- Fuck!

739
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:12,819
No. No!

740
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,784
Shannon,
what did you do?

741
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,670
(thumping)

742
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,042
The roof. The roof.

743
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,093
(Shannon screams)

744
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:38,511
(gunshot)

745
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,145
(man screams)

746
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,527
(neck cracks)

747
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,648
Come on.

748
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,408
Fuck off.

749
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,343
My boy.

750
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,862
My boy.

751
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,509
(screams)

752
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,177
(crunches)
(man groans)

753
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:05,393
(straining)

754
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,102
(grunts)

755
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,943
HENSON:
Hey, that was my idea.

756
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,449
You gonna have
all the fun?

757
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,449
(coughing)

758
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,493
Hey, hey.

759
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,913
- Fuck, man.
- You're okay. You're okay.

760
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,548
I only have one bullet, man.

761
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,084
Are you okay?
Are you all right, man?

762
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,969
Just breathe. We got them.
We got them good.

763
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,050
(banging)
- Get out of here, man.

764
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:40,090
Go. Get the fuck out, go.

765
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,850
ADAM: Hey.

766
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,851
(banging)

767
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,557
(people screaming)

768
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,146
(crashing, banging)

769
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,230
ADAM:
Mary, cover the front.

770
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,321
(panting)

771
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,916
(Henson coughing)

772
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,260
(gasping)

773
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,479
And that's zero,
motherfucker.

774
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,525
(screams)

775
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,482
Shannon.

776
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,521
Henson!

777
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,690
Henson, help me!

778
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,609
Argh! No!

779
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,997
Come on, Shannon, go.
Come on.

780
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,413
- Come on.
- Come on, Henson.

781
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,578
- Come on, go. Get in the house.
- Come on.

782
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,624
Get in the house.
Come on, go. I ain't coming.

783
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,211
Come on, come on.

784
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,251
I'll take care of these
motherfuckers.

785
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,546
Come on, come get some.

786
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,931
'Cause you picked
a wrong motherfucker.

787
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,013
Come on. Four.

788
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,304
Three.

789
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,723
Where are you at, bitch?
Two.

790
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,401
One.

791
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,856
(gun clicks)

792
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,021
Oh, fuck.

793
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,487
Oh, fuck.

794
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:24,027
(laughing)

795
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,949
Oh, you'll never
knock me down, man.

796
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:34,372
And I hope I make
all of y'all sick, motherfucker.

797
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,346
Here, take it.
Cover the kitchen.

798
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,475
Where's Henson?

799
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,436
What?

800
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,651
No. No.

801
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,282
Fuck.

802
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,286
SHANNON:
What the fuck?

803
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,959
Are we just gonna
stay in here forever?

804
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:50,469
They eat their own,
don't they?

805
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:57,481
I mean, shit, we killed enough
of them to feed them for a month.

806
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,858
Why the hell
are they still after us?

807
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,394
They're still human.

808
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,318
What's more human
than revenge?

809
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,360
SHANNON:
So now this is my fault?

810
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,075
This is about the boy?

811
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,080
FATHER:
Do it now!

812
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,745
Fuck.

813
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:23,040
(glass shatters)

814
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,793
Stay back.

815
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,713
Well, it's about time.

816
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,098
I figured they would have done that
earlier, save themselves trouble.

817
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:33,725
They weren't gonna destroy the house
if they didn't have to.

818
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,260
All right, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

819
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,814
ADAM: Well, we're not gonna
stay in here and burn.

820
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,517
We got seven
coming up the front.

821
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,603
- How many shots in that rifle?
- Just one.

822
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,108
Use it.

823
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:44,315
No, save it.

824
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,280
Mary, what are you doing?

825
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,692
I'm stalling them while you two
run out the back.

826
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,240
I need to do this.

827
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,744
Do you think
this changes anything?

828
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,412
No.

829
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,790
No.

830
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,513
I'm just tired of waiting.

831
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,227
Come on, Adam, let's get
the fuck out of here.

832
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,357
Whoa. Take it easy.

833
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,154
Are you sure you got enough bullets
in that thing for all of us?

834
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,411
The ones inside are mine.

835
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:46,752
I brought them here.
I trapped them.

836
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,508
They're my kill.

837
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,340
Oh?

838
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,051
Your kill?

839
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:00,349
So you're not
with them, huh?

840
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,934
Yeah, I don't know
why I didn't see it before.

841
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,270
There's a look that people get
when they're seeing something

842
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:08,653
they've never seen before.
You... you don't have that look.

843
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,774
So you should know
that this is

844
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,534
an invitation-only party.

845
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,946
This is our land,

846
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,705
our kill.

847
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,707
And now you...

848
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,164
you belong to us, too.

849
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,838
My boy.

850
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,295
For your head.

851
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,553
You know,
and if you're gonna do it, do it.

852
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,430
Shoot me.
Go ahead, do it.

853
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,012
Either way you're gonna be
the prize pig at my camp tonight.

854
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,348
(cocks gun)
(gun clicks)

855
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,683
Oh.

856
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,896
You fuckers.

857
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,901
Fuck!

858
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,937
Adam.

859
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,106
I can't leave her.

860
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,993
Just forget her
and let's go.

861
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,707
She's dead.

862
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,168
Why would you do that?

863
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,299
The plan, Adam...

864
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,711
making sure she doesn't
survive the night.

865
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,049
Or are you forgetting
she's one of them?

866
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,214
- She's not one of them.
- Yes, she is.

867
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,600
- She's not one of them.
- What are you doing?

868
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,601
Just go.

869
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,512
- Just go!

870
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,295
Pretty.

871
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,380
You're mine.
You're mine.

872
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,891
No!

873
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,227
I am now gonna taste

874
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:15,192
your raw, sweet pain, bitch.
You hear me?

875
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,820
Come on, come on, come on.

876
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,580
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.

877
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,721
Die, you fucks.

878
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,140
(coughs)

879
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,398
Come on. Okay.

880
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,064
Come on. Come on.

881
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,419
(rapid footsteps)

882
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,686
Where the fuck are you,
little son of a...?

883
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,775
(screams)

884
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,705
(grunts)

885
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,198
(gurgles)

886
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,056
(fire crackling)

887
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,544
Your wife and daughter...

888
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,047
what were their names?

889
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,421
Nikki

890
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,756
and Ava.

891
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,259
She was such a happy kid.

892
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,557
Nothing ever got to her,
even in this.

893
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:25,404
That's because she was loved
every second she was alive.

894
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,571
She had her family.

895
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,415
I couldn't protect them.

896
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,669
What matters is you did
for as long as you could.

897
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,169
You loved them
enough to try.

898
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,185
Why did you come back?

899
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:59,772
Nothing's changed

900
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,558
in so long.

901
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:09,482
I know who
is waiting for me.

902
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:17,616
Maybe I was just looking
for a sign,

903
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:21,127
something to make them
proud of me again.

904
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,795
Maybe that was you.

905
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:33,131
Maybe I was just tired
of being the victim.

906
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,931
It was the right thing to do.

907
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,901
Oh, my God.

908
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,937
It's so peaceful.

909
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,981
(chuckles)

910
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,149
Yeah.

911
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,701
Yeah.

912
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,499
You have the chance
to learn to live again.

913
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,128
Don't waste it.

914
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:20,520
(long exhale)

915
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,891
