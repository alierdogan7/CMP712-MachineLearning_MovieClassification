You can't fix that with a nice paint job.

who's getting divorced, ain't you?

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,458
Thanks for bringing it up.

180
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,499
There's worse things
than getting divorced.

181
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,624
Rape, murder, castration.

182
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,249
Fair enough.

183
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:40,124
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?

184
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:43,958
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.

Well, it's just a dead-end

I thought it was a wind-up.

outnumber the men four to one.

- (MIKEY) Yes, they do, Neil.
- Oh...

191

- Obviously.

(NEIL) Yeah, well done.

this weekend, Mikey?

She's off on a cruise

208
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,416
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.

209
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:30,583
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?

- Well... I did say...
