1
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,520
(wind blowing)

2
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,185
- Sorry about the rough ride, Mr. Taylor.

3
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,753
This weather just came out of nowhere.
- How much farther?

4
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,222
- I should have you on the ground
in about fifteen minutes.

5
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,691
- Did you hear that, honey?
We're almost home.

6
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,293
(child gasping)

7
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,493
- Whatcha reading there, Trooper?

8
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,233
- Sweetie, the nice lady
asked you a question.

9
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,706
Ah, last night he would hardly stop
talking about it.

10
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,933
Kept insisting that one of those
dinosaur things

11
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,474
was hiding in the closet.

12
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,703
- Oh, dinosaurs, huh?

13
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,044
- Oh yeah, kid's got a heck
of an imagination.

14
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,242
Don't even try talking him out of it.
- I know what you mean.

15
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,250
Oh! My daughter's his age.

16
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,945
She sets her mind on something?

17
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,112
Look out.

18
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,985
- We should get
the two of them together.

19
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,785
- Yeah.

20
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,359
- Sweetie, what is it?

21
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,656
(breathing heavily)

22
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,731
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

23
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,333
Baby, talk to me.

24
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,608
(crashing)

25
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,345
(cell phone buzzing)

26
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,544
- Oh shit.

27
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,077
- Where are you?

28
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,153
- Ah, we stopped for gas.

29
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,623
- Call my cell
the moment you get to the concert

30
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,621
so I know you made it.
- Yes, Dad.

31
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,556
- And no booze.
Just because I've lost my mind

32
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,162
and I'm letting you out of my sight
for a whole weekend...

33
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,730
- Don't you trust me?

34
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,594
- I'm your father,
I don't have that luxury.

35
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,362
- Well you better get used to it,
'cause this time next week,

36
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,003
I'll be 3,000 miles away.

37
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,333
- And I couldn't be prouder.

38
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,066
Thanks.

39
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,235
Listen, I know you think
you're all grown up

40
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,644
and you don't need my advice,
but you're still just a kid, Sara.

41
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,114
We don't always get second chances
when we screw up.

42
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,513
And another thing,

43
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,588
don't let what's-his-name
behind the wheel, the wrestler.

44
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,986
- I'm not gonna let anyone else
drive, Dad.

45
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,951
Love you.

46
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,459
- Goodbye.

47
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,040
- No regrets, right?

48
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,170
- Yo. Hitchcock.

49
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,502
The action's right here.

50
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,699
- And here we have the fabled
Man-squatch.

51
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,876
(whispering): One false move
could alert him to our presence.

52
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,606
(belching)

53
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,809
- Raargh!!!

54
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,250
(laughing): No...no!

55
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,428
Whoa.
Bin Laden, what's up man?

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,067
- Sal!... relax.

57
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,702
- Making new friends?

58
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,235
- Yeah, I'm making new friends...

59
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,703
- Ay, ay, ay, wanna be our friend?

60
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,432
Ah, I guess not.

61
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,975
I'm serious, is anybody else
kinda nervous about this guy,

62
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,271
or is it just me?

63
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,380
- It's just you.

64
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,480
Hey, how's it going?

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,710
- Not bad, looking forward
to a little R&R.

66
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,355
- Yeah, well I don't think
you'll be needing these to crowd surf.

67
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,756
- Yeah, well the... um...
canyon's got some nice runs, so...

68
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,259
- You're going to do some
rock climbing?

69
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,023
- Crossed my mind....

70
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,434
Where's uh, where's Sara?

71
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,531
- She's probably taking
another lesson, right?

72
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,195
- You're hilarious.

73
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,210
- Let me shoot some of this.
- Who's the film major?

74
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,708
- Oh, shut up.
- No.

75
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,903
- Come on.
- No.

76
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,344
- There she is.
- Ah, I know, I'm late.

77
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,451
A screw-up with our booking,
I had to do a little sweet-talking.

78
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,247
- We still get the plane?
- Have I ever let my best friend down?

79
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,616
- No.

80
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,783
Coldplay, here we come.

81
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,555
- Whooooo!!!!
- This is gonna be a killer, Sara.

82
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,561
Here's to Sara, huh?

83
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,065
The best...
shit, the only pilot I know.

84
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,429
- Are you nuts? Put that away before
you get me in trouble, seriously.

85
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,038
- Nice work, cuz.
- Ooof! Careful.

86
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,111
Somebody's been hitting the gym.

87
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,440
- Ah, Sara?

88
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,979
- There you are, hey.

89
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,586
- Oh here, I'll get these for you.

90
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,349
- Sal, take note.
- Ha, ha, ha...

91
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,753
- Hey, man.
- Cory.

92
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,257
- My cousin.
I told you about him.

93
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,918
- Sure, hi.
- Hey, Bruce.

94
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,758
- You know Mel, Sal.
- Smile.

95
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,924
- Okay, are we all set?
- Yeah, come on.

96
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,591
- Yeah, just waitin' on you,
sweet cheeks.

97
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,635
- He's such as gentleman, isn't he?
- He's charming.

98
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,740
- Bags?
- Yes, bags, bags, hey, bags!

99
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,808
- Really, man?
- I need some help, come on.

100
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,343
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,741
- Ahhh!
- What do you have in this thing?

102
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,576
- Let's go.

103
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,207
- The weather going to be a problem?

104
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,343
- For flying?
- Yeah.

105
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,649
- It's a low cloud,
it'll burn off any minute...

106
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,225
Hey, just relax, okay?

107
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,557
Let me do my thing.
- Okay.

108
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,499
- Hey, so Sara, the General's cool
with this all, right?

109
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,392
- Cool with what?

110
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,299
- With you doing
the whole sky captain thing.

111
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,066
I mean, it didn't really work out
too well for your mom, so...

112
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,904
- Could you be any more insensitive?
- Relax...

113
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,342
Look, no offense, Sara.
I'm just, ya know...

114
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,879
- None taken.

115
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,812
I'm not my mother,
and he's a Colonel.

116
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,411
Let's just go have some fun, okay?

117
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,218
- Yeah, heh.

118
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,889
- Remind me why I'm dating you again?

119
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,116
- That's it?

120
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,888
- What were you expecting?
A private jet?

121
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,691
- For the money we're paying I half
expected John Travolta to walk out.

122
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,026
(laughing)

123
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,963
- Fuel isn't cheap,
we're already getting a discount

124
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,333
through the flight school, so stop.
- Yeah, come on. Live a little.

125
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,107
- How much d'you think one of these
little puddle jumpers costs anyways?

126
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,575
- If the music thing works out,
I'll send you a brochure.

127
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,273
-"If" the music thing works out?
- Sorry, "when" it works out.

128
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,112
- "When" the music thing works out.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,718
- All right, pilot.
- Okay, baggage goes in the rear.

130
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,882
Everything you don't want
to carry on your laps.

131
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,587
- All right, I'm going in the rear.
- You always got a lot of baggage.

132
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,892
- Comin' in.

133
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,625
- I should go talk to him.
I'll be right back.

134
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,396
- Oh yeah, get Rain Man.

135
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,132
- Hey, be nice.
- I'm super nice.

136
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,141
- Get your booty in there.
- God, Sal.

137
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,702
Oh wow.

138
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,906
- Um... we're going to get...
really friendly.

139
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,752
Where'd Sara find the stiff?

140
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,945
- He found her.

141
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,215
- What do you mean he found her?

142
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,224
- He just kinda showed up one day.
She was looking for a study partner.

143
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,362
Smart guy.

144
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,090
- Wait a second, she's playing
hide the sausage with her tutor?

145
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,393
- I guess a big brain can be a turn on.

146
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,127
Not that I speak from experience.

147
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,862
- Big brain?
He's a trust fund prick.

148
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,132
- Come on.

149
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,708
- Beer?
- No.

150
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,335
- Trust fund, what do you mean?
His parents rich or something?

151
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,839
- Or something.

152
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,151
- You okay?

153
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,118
- Yeah, I'm fine.

154
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,813
- You sure?

155
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,788
You don't look so good.

156
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,595
(laughing)

157
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,865
- Yeah, yeah I am, sure.

158
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,506
- Okay... well....

159
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,540
let's go.

160
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,169
- Why do you let Sal do that?

161
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,541
Talk about your mom that way?

162
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,912
- He likes pushing people's buttons.
I'm used to it.

163
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,110
- Well that doesn't mean it's okay.

164
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,050
- Hey, this is our last weekend together.

165
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,986
Do you really want to spend it
arguing about Sal?

166
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,286
- Don't say that.
- Don't say what?

167
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,621
- Last weekend.

168
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,356
You make it sound like we're never
going to see each other again.

169
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,126
- Hey, Montreal's a long way from here.

170
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,768
This is a big deal for me.

171
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,928
- You don't think it's a big deal
for me, too?

172
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,765
- Look, let's not talk about it now,
okay?

173
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,981
You're not afraid to fly, are you?

174
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,050
- Pantheon 520, wind is 330 at 7,

175
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,778
turn right onto taxiway bravo and hold.

176
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,225
520, additional traffic

177
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,300
will be departing shortly
runway one five left.

178
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,130
Six Echo Whiskey,
cleared to land runway three.

179
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
Be aware of departing traffic
at your one o'clock.

180
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,309
(clanking)

181
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,437
- Sara!

182
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,675
Is it always so noisy?

183
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,648
Sara!

184
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,118
- What?
- Is it always this noisy?

185
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,952
- I don't want to have to dub everything.
- It won't be so bad once we're up.

186
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,218
- Dub everything?
Are you serious?

187
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,156
I just want some better material
for my reel.

188
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,626
- What, and this is better material?

189
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,255
- Don't worry, I'll edit you out.

190
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,798
- By any means necessary.

191
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,666
- You got it.
- Malcolm X, right?

192
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,999
- Very nice.

193
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,405
- Actually, it's from Dirty Hands,
the Sartre play.

194
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,205
Jean-Paul Sartre, the existentialist?

195
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,304
Man is what he wills himself to be,
hell is other people...

196
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,679
- I will myself to be awesome.

197
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,255
- So does Sal. Right, babe?

198
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,382
- Yeah.
Get that fucking thing away.

199
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,652
- Philistines.

200
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,924
- Pantheon 520 is released.

201
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,228
Contact Lakeview Centre
11 niner decimal one.

202
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,497

Yankee Zulu X-ray,

203
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,197

205
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,971
- Yankee Zulu X-ray, holding short.

206
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,036
- Hey, Capitan.
What's our ETA?

207
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,972
- Ah, with a good tail wind,
it's about a 90 minute flight.

208
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,443
(with accent): Nice, plenty of time to
get shitfaced before concert, huh?

209
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,275
- Well, you're well on your way.

210
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,941
- You guys want one?
- No.

211
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,643
- All right, more for me.

212
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,019
- What are those for?
- Um, motion sickness.

213
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,559
- Yeah, try not to yak on me
on this flight. Okay, sweet cheeks?

214
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,323
- Thanks for being so supportive.

215
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,089
- At least it's only like an hour
and a half flight.

216
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,827
The drive up there was brutal,
remember?

217
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,530
- We might get a decent camping spot
this year, which would be amazing.

218
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,766
- I don't know, there's supposed to be
like twice as many people this year.

219
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,706
- How 'bout you relax,
there's going to be room.

220
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,471
- Hey, that's what you said last year.

221
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,773
- So?

222
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,973
- So, we ended up sleeping in a ditch.

223
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,243
- That's funny because
I don't remember being in a ditch.

224
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,411
- I'm surprised you remember
your name after all that tequila.

225
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,719
- Ah, yeah.
(laughing)

226
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,792
(jumbled instructions)

227
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,130
- How many times have you done this?
- You mean soloed?

228
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,393
- Yeah, no instructor,
no co-pilot, just you.

229
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,935
- Plenty. You need a lot of hours
before they let you fly a twin.

230
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,939
- How about in this plane,
how many times in this plane?

231
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,873
- Well, never, because it's a rental.
- No, you know what I mean,

232
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,003
like this type of plane.
- Enough.

233
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,546
Okay? Enough.

234
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,212
- Whoa!

235
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,523
Look what we got here, huh?

236
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,091
- Is that what I think it is?

237
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,693
- Whoooaa!
Yeah! It's a parachute!

238
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,022
If anything happens,
we got this, right?

239
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,927
Whoooo!
Bail out, bail out!

240
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,624
- Be careful with that.

241
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,395
- Alright, alright, just playing.

242
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,333
- Well, play with something else.

243
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,733
- Oh, okay.
You like that shit?

244
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,468
- Don't encourage him.
- Oh yeah.

245
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,009
- Very good.

246
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,679
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
cleared for takeoff, one five left,

247
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,280
to 1000 feet,

00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,405
one niner decimal one.

249
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,348
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
cleared for takeoff, one five left.

250
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,118
Okay, here we go,
buckle up back there.

251
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,747
- Whooo!

252
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,861
- Please insert tab into buckle.

253
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,797
- Okay line-ups, cowl flaps open,

254
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,128
mixture rich, props forward.

Transponder alt, lights on,

256
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,702

258
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,604
power set.

259
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,279
- Whooo!

260
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,939
- Hey!
- Let's do it, ha!

261
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,642
- That's so not okay.
- Whoooo!

262
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,720
- Gauges green.
Air speed alive.

263
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,827
- Whooo!
- 85 knots.

264
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,403
85 rotate.
- Yeah!

265
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,999
- Whooooo!

266
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,996
- After takeoff checks, fuel pumps off,

267
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,830
engine gauges green.

268
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,968
(sighing)

269
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,437
Beautiful, isn't it.

270
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,010
(laughing)

271
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,514
- Wow, Sara, this is amazing.

272
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,894
(loud belch)

273
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,291
- Seriously?

274
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,728
- That was fucking disgusting.

275
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,401
- If you puke in here,
you are sleeping alone tonight.

276
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,267
- That's an empty threat.

277
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,269
- That's what happens
when you drink and fly, kids.

278
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,810
I don't recommend it, do you?

279
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,106
(moaning)

280
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,408
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
Harrisford V.O.R.

281
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,678
out of 2,200 for 5,500
en route to Green Lake.

282
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,516
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
squawk 5247 and ident,

283
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,214
cleared 5,500.

284
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,657
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
squawk 5247 cleared 5,500.

285
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,729
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
you're radar identified,

286
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,457
Green Lake altimeter
is two niner, eight niner...

287
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,827
- Yankee Zulu X-ray, roger.

288
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,094
- What's happening?

289
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:28,036
- Um, I just told them who we are
and what we want to do

290
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,403
and they assigned us
a new transponder code

291
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,736
so radar can identify us.

292
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,540
It's all routine,
there's nothing to worry about.

293
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,546
- So Sara, what's with you
taking the train to McGill?

294
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,743
- It was my dad's idea,

295
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,514
he thought I could see more
of the country that way.

296
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,681
- Do you still need a ride
at the ass crack of dawn?

297
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,157
- No, it's okay, I've got it covered.

298
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,493
- Um... actually my dad
really wanted to see me off,

299
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,225
so I told him he could drive.

300
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,001
- Whatever, just let me know.

301
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,074
- Yeah, but I thought that...

302
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,770
(turbulence)

303
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,415
Never mind.

304
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,912
- Someone take this, take it.

305
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,561
- Ah, great.

306
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,161
This thing always gets out of tune.

307
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,800
- Tune it up.
- What are you doing?

308
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,496
- Filming you.

309
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,664
- Yeah, I can see that.

310
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,172
- Right...

311
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,970
- So you gonna shoot that video
for my band or what?

312
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,739
- It depends,
do I still get final cut?

313
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,007
- Whatever you want,
as long as it got hoes in it.

314
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,344
- Classy, I like it.

315
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,186
Speaking of hoes,
how's the love life?

316
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,847
- Whoa, getting a little personal,
don't you think?

317
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,482
- Come on, you can tell me.
Anybody special?

318
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,151
- There might be.
- It's a dude.

319
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,763
- Oh yeah?

320
00:19:58,897 --> 00:19:59,864
Anybody we know?

321
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,490
- Um... I'd better not say.

322
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,193
- Why not?

323
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,100
- She's got a boyfriend.

324
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,835
- Funny guy...

325
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,442
(laughing)

326
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,976
Funny guy.

327
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,920
- Shouldn't you keep your hands
on the wheel?

328
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,524
- It's okay, that's what
the rudder pedals are for.

329
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,068
(guitar)

330
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,236
- You forget something?

331
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,105
- No, just making sure
my gift's not getting crushed.

332
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,805
(giggling)
You brought it?

333
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,915
- Of course I did.
- What gift?

334
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,676
- Just a little something.

335
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,810
- Oh yeah, what'd you get him,
a personality or something?

336
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,012
- Show us.

337
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,248
- Nah, it's just a... comic book.

338
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,791
- The guy at the store said
it was pretty rare...

339
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,588
and since Bruce was a collector.

340
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,697
- A comic book?

341
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,923
You're one of those guys.

342
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,657
- What is that supposed to mean?

343
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,461
- Nothing, buddy,
come on, let me see it.

344
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,502
- Yeah, come on.

345
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,935
- Come on, let me see it.

346
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,370
- You can't right now,
because he is flying the plane.

347
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,600
- Whoa.
- Sara.

348
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,177
- Sara, can you please stop
screwing around with this guy.

349
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,280
That'd be great.
- Our lives are in his hands.

350
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,473
- Just, just relax, okay?
She knows what she's doing.

351
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,482
- You're doing fine. See?

352
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,917
It's not that hard.

353
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,246
(turbulence)
- Woo, jeez!

354
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,624
- Shit! Shit!

355
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,160
- I think we get the point now,
take back the controls,

356
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,594
please, Sara!

357
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,494
- Just a little bit of turbulence.
Pull back slowly.

358
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,260
- I can't!
- Pull back slowly.

359
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,426
- I can't.

360
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,968
- Sara, this isn't funny anymore, okay?
- Come on, pull back.

361
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,908
- I think we'd all be more comfortable
with Sara flying the plane.

362
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,242
- Hey, Sara, come on, huh!

363
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,590
- Jesus, Sara, God.

364
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,821
- Next time I wanna be in front.

365
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,430
- Are you alright?

366
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,157
- Fuck this shit, gimme this!

367
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,729
- Hey!
- Sal! Come on.

368
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,598
- What you gonna do, punk, huh?

369
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,831
Oh, I'm sorry, is this yours?

370
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,703
Oooo, Weird Stories.

371
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,503
Oooo, creepy!

372
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,202
- Dude, d'you mind?
- Guys.

373
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,745
- You want it?
- Give it back.

374
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,313
- Be careful!
- Take it easy, guys.

375
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,849
- Careful, careful, it's a comic book.

376
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,451
- Sal, just give it back.

377
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,215
- Oh my God, I'm taking it out
of its protective case thing...

378
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,587
Oh my God...

379
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,250
great condition.
- Sal.

380
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,521
- You're so not funny, stop it.

381
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,324
- Dude.
- Oh... it's ripping...

382
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,695
(ripping)

383
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,358
- Sal, what are you doing?

384
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:55,439
- Oh my God, this looks
pretty important to the story.

385
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,007
- Seriously?

386
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,770
- Ah!

387
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,375
- What are you, seven years old,
reading comics?

388
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,506
The next time
you try and get us killed,

389
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,015
I'm wiping my whole ass with it.

390
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,847
- Hey, Sal, that's enough!

391
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,579
Okay, just give it back to him.

392
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,019
- Fucking little kid,
still reading comics.

393
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,988
- Give it to him!
- You want your comic?

394
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,424
You want your comic?
Take your fucking comic!

395
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,721
- Come on, Sal.

396
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,624
- It's okay.

397
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,132
- What's that?

398
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,435
- It's a...

399
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,635
a bus ticket to Montreal.

400
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,007
- Montreal, isn't that
where you're moving, Sara?

401
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,451
Sorry, man.

402
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,592
- I was gonna tell you.

403
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,962
- When exactly where you going
to tell me?

404
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,994
- Um...

405
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,799
- We'll talk about this later.

406
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,646
Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray.
- Yankee Zulu X-ray.

407
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,582
- Yankee Zulu X-ray requesting
10,500 for weather.

408
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,951
- Yankee Zulu X-ray,
you're cleared at 10,500,

409
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,955
negative traffic.

410
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,190
- Hey, what's going on?

411
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,059
- Um, we've got weather ahead
and I'm not instrument rated.

412
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,894
So we'll have to climb above it.

413
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,968
- Whoa, what does
'not instrument rated' mean?

414
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,002
- It means I have to visually
maintain separation

415
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,605
from the ground at all times.

416
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,606
- Translation, it means,
she can't fly through clouds.

417
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,711
- Clouds.
Are you kidding me?

418
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,438
- Will you shut up?

419
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,982
(clanking)

420
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,530
- How high does this thing go,
anyway?

421
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,672
- Service ceiling is 24,000.

422
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,466
- 24,000...

423
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:13,133
- Look at it this way,
commercial airlines fly at 40.

424
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,810
Sorry about that, guys.
It's just a little bit of unsettled air.

425
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,850
- Unsettled air?
- It's the third time.

426
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,786
- 10,000...

427
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,256
- Aren't we supposed
to level off or something?

428
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,125
- I'm trying.
- What you mean, you're trying?

429
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,257
- It means, I'm trying.

430
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,267
- Quit screwing around, Sara!
- This isn't a joke!

431
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,238
The elevator's not responding
for some reason.

432
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,139
- There's an elevator?
- Not that kind of elevator!

433
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,146
- You see that part on the tail
that's sticking up at an angle?

434
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,977
- Which part?
- The hinged section

435
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,141
- Yes.

436
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,652
- When air goes over it,
the tail goes down, making us go up.

437
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,721
I don't, I don't know,
something's jammed it.

438
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,791
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Come on.

439
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,552
- What do we do?
- Mel, put the camera away!

440
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,351
Ten minutes!

441
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,432
- Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray, I, uh,
I think I have a problem here.

442
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,160
- Yankee Zulu X-ray, Centre,
are you declaring an emergency?

443
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,566
- Yankee Zulu X-ray... uh...

444
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,467
Not at this time.
- Not at this time?

445
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,269
I thought you said we couldn't level off!

446
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,106
- No, there are procedures for this.
Okay, I'll just reduce power.

447
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,610
- You should tell him that then, Sara.

448
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,215
- Hey!
Who's the pilot here?

449
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,351
Everyone just relax, okay?

450
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,430
- Oh no.

451
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,944
- Oh, shit.

452
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,220
- We should probably turn around.
Turn this thing around.

453
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,323
- Sara, we need to go back!
Let's turn around, now!

454
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,652
- Yeah.

455
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,565
What the hell?

456
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,736
(lightning)

457
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,661
- This is bad.

458
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,322
I'm pretty sure this is bad.
(lightning)

459
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,451
- Everybody just stay calm, okay?

460
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,090
20,000...?

461
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,186
That's impossible.

462
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,391
- 20,000 feet?
Is that right?

463
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,428
- Can't be, there must be
some kind of glitch.

464
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,796
Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray,
my elevator's jammed

465
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,403
and my instruments are malfunctioning,

466
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,770
I am climbing and have lost position
in cloud, please advise.

467
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,367
Centre, Yankee Zulu X-ray!!!

468
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,536
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

469
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,571
- I can't raise anybody.

470
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,150
- What do you mean
you can't raise anybody?

471
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,345
- Mayday, mayday, mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray,

472
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,820
approximately 15 miles
east of Patterson V.O.R.

473
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,983
Altitude unknown, instrument failure,
please respond.

474
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,189
Mayday, mayday, mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray!!

475
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,323
(strange noise)

476
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:02,833
- Sara?

477
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,441
Sara?

478
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,341
- No one is answering.

479
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,004
There's nothing.

480
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,413
Just dead air.
- Jesus Christ.

481
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,540
- So what do we do?

482
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,654
- I don't know.

483
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,755
- You don't know?
You're the pilot!

484
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,949
Get us out of this!
- What about the procedures?

485
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,186
You said you wanted to reduce power?
- I can't risk it now, visibility is zero

486
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,729
and without instruments, we could fly
straight into a mountain.

487
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,197
- Hey, what did you do?

488
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,132
Huh? You let him fly the plane.

489
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,771
He probably fucked something up.
- He didn't do anything!

490
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,600
- Yeah, well somebody did!

491
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,606
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know he's right.

492
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,213
This is your fault Sara.
- This is not my fault!

493
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,349
- How long have you had your license?
- Long enough.

494
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,145
- You only checked out on one
of these things like a week ago?

495
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,651
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I was stupid enough--

496
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,223
- Sal! Will you just calm down?
You're not helping.

497
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,158
- Maybe I missed something
during the pre-flight, I don't know.

498
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,320
- You missed something?!
- We need to contact traffic control.

499
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,400
If they still have a radar fix on us,
they can talk us down.

500
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,669
Cell phones,
does anyone have a signal?

501
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,003
(beep)
- No. Wait, wait...

502
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,400
(beep)
Fuck, I got nothing.

503
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,136
- Same here.

504
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,508
- Oh, think.

505
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,417
Something's wrong, we're stalling.

506
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,112
I have to go to maximum power.

507
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,382
Bruce?

508
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,089
Bruce! Goddamn it!

509
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,458
There's a pilot operating handbook
underneath the seat,

510
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,154
can you give it to me?
Please.

511
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,357
- I thought you knew
how to fly this thing?

512
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,627
- Just give it to me, please.
Give it to me!

513
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,197
Go to section five.

514
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,212
- Now what?

515
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,746
- The maximum takeoff weight,
it should say somewhere.

516
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,807
- Uh... 6,500.

517
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,214
- Okay, if we're over that,
the stall speed will change.

518
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,446
What's the basic empty weight?

519
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,682
- Uh, 4891.
- Sal, how much do you weigh?

520
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,959
- What?
- How much?

521
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,692
- Uh, 170, why?

522
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,887
- Mel?
- 110.

523
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,362
- 155.
- Bruce?

524
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,967
Bruce, please!
- Uh, 150.

525
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,797
- Okay, I'm 110,
plus a 100 for baggage.

526
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,338
1,000 for fuel. Um...

527
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,873
- 1,800.

528
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,669
- 1,800?

529
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,039
We're too heavy. We should get rid
of anything we don't need.

530
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,875
- You kidding me?
- I look like I'm kidding?

531
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,813
- I'm not throwing
my stuff out of the plane.

532
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,282
- I'll do it for you.

533
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,681
- Sal! No!

534
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,085
No!
- Sit down!

535
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,554
- You want me to open the hatch?

536
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,693
- Be careful... please.

537
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,226
- You know I will.

538
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,419
Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.

539
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,360
I know, I got you, I got you.

540
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,056
- Got me?
- Alright, I'm opening.

541
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,767
- Be careful back there.
- Ready?

542
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,837
One... two... three!

543
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,001
- I got you.
- I'm good, I'm good.

544
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,576
- Are you ready?
- Can't keep this thing in tune anyway.

545
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,871
- And you play like shit.

546
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,749
- What's next?

547
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,388
- You got it, you got it?
- What's next?

548
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,085
Your bag, I'll get the other one.

549
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,564
- What the fuck?

550
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,724
- What is it?
What's going on?

551
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,995
- Sal, what's wrong with you?

552
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,729
- I just, I just saw something.

553
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,202
- What?
- I don't know!

554
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,432
- Guys!
- I need you, okay?

555
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,838
- Focus!
- I know, I know!

556
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,468
- Uh... I think that's it.
- Okay, you're next, go!

557
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,776
- What are you holding out on us?
- Look man, that stays, alright?

558
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,214
- Alright, well I'm keeping
something too, huh?

559
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,413
- That's it, come on!

560
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,889
(grunting)

561
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,694
- Is it better?

562
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,802
- Maybe, uh, I don't know.

563
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,593
This doesn't make sense.

564
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,366
The systems aren't supposed
to fail like this.

565
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,374
(panting)

566
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,840
- So how long do we have?

567
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,776
Sara.

568
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,685
Sara, how long do we have?

569
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,397
- We'll be out of fuel
in less than an hour.

570
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,980
- What are you saying?

571
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,312
- When we took off,
the tanks were only half full.

572
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,361
- We're going to draw straws,

573
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,128
and the winner gets the parachute.

574
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,280
- Oh, come on.

575
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,313
- It's a good idea.
- What?

576
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,542
- He's right.

577
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,709
- I can't believe
you're even talking about this.

578
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,720
- You guys, it's too dangerous.
- Too dangerous?

579
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,051
- Is that a joke?

580
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,092
- We don't know who put that chute here,
or if it's packed properly.

581
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,356
None of us have even skydived before!
- Well how hard can it be?

582
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,762
- We could be at 10,000 feet,
or at 1,000.

583
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,165
You jump when we're too low,
you're gonna hit the ground

584
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,998
before your chute opens,
if it even opens.

585
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,470
Are you crazy?
- Too low?

586
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,507
We've been going up the whole time.
- Have we?

587
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,205
The first thing they teach you
at flight school is just

588
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,780
how disoriented you get
when you can't see the ground.

589
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,543
There's no way
that we're putting that on.

590
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,948
There's no way.

591
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,356
- You know what? Screw this.
Mel, take it.

592
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,795
- What are you doing?
- You're putting it on.

593
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,061
- What are you doing, man?
- I'm saving her life, man.

594
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,396
Take it.

595
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,698
- Hey, back off, Cory.

596
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,773
- No.
- I'm not going to let you die.

597
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:15,072
- Look man, I said back off,
we're drawing straws like I said before.

598
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,375
- She's your girlfriend, man.
What, you're going to let her die?

599
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,485
- Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

600
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,144
I'm gonna decide.
- Decide what?

601
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,230
- God, you're a fucking asshole,
you know that?

602
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,271
- Oh yeah, I'm the asshole here, right?

603
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,468
- Stop it! Quit it!

604
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,975
- What the hell is going on
back there?

605
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,114
- Stop it!

606
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,181
Both of you, stop it!

607
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,085
- That the best you got, man?

608
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,191
That what they teach you in school?

609
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,225
- Fuck off man, fuck off.

610
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,085
- No wonder you lost
every wrestling match.

611
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,198
- Fuck you!
I didn't lose every match.

612
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,231
(beeping)

613
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,529
- Shit.

614
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,539
(beeping)

615
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,166
- Un-fucking-believable.
Gimme that!

616
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,369
- Stop!
- No!

617
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,570
- Gimme.
- Let go!

618
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,977
- Leave her alone!
- Stop it!

619
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,515
Everybody, stop it!

620
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,815
Do you want to get out of this alive?

621
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,752
Do you?

622
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,449
Do you want to get out of this alive?

623
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,427
Well then I'm the pilot
and what I say goes.

624
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,588
Is that acceptable to you?

625
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,499
Is that acceptable, yes or no?

626
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,364
Is that acceptable?

627
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,870
Good.

628
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,274
Everyone just stay in your seat
and shut up.

629
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,216
- We're going to die like them.

630
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,889
We're going to die like them.

631
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,890
- What do you mean?

632
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,294
- We're going to die like them.
We have to get down.

633
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,425
- Bruce, we're all scared, okay?
Just take it easy.

634
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,968
- No, we have to land the plane.

635
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,203
We have to get the plane down.

636
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,509
- Just relax.
- No, we have to get me down.

637
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,875
We have to get down!
We have to get down!

638
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,415
We have to get me down!
Get me down!

639
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,518
Get me down!
- No!

640
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,985
- No!
- No!

641
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,685
- I'm not gonna die like them!

642
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,258
I'm not gonna die like them!

643
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,487
- Relax alright!
Just relax.

644
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,394
There we go, there we go.
Just relax.

645
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,368
- Sal, what are you doing?

646
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,565
- There we go. There it is.

647
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,013
- Who's flying the plane?
- The autopilot.

648
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,173
- Is he breathing?

649
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,150
- He'll be fine,
I just put him to sleep.

650
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,483
- What was all that shit he said
about people dying?

651
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,550
- His parents died in a car accident.
- Are you sure?

652
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,059
- You know, if he's so afraid of flying,
why'd he come?

653
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,389
- Because I invited him.

654
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,430
- You know what?
That's right, I forgot.

655
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,533
He's a freak and he's in love.

656
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,568
- We're not in love.

657
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,598
- Yeah?
Does he know that?

658
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,073
What are you gonna do?

659
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,235
One last weekend of pity sex with him
and trash him like a leaky rubber?

660
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,473
Is that what you're gonna do?

661
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,049
That's cold.
That's cold, sweetie.

662
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,588
- You don't know a thing about me
or what I want.

663
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,754
- Yeah, whatever.

664
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,426
We better tie him up.

665
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,188
- Tie him up?

666
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,025
Isn't that a bit extreme?

667
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,430
- You want him to go all kamikaze
on us again, huh?

668
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,334
- You got a blade, man?

669
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,215
- Alright.

670
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,825
- Ah!
- Sara.

671
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,989
It's getting really cold in here, Sara.

672
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,326
- I'm sorry,
this cabin isn't pressurized.

673
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,096
- Isn't there a heater?
- Yeah, there is, but we can't use it.

674
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,940
- Why?
- It runs on the main fuel supply

675
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,939
and we need every last drop
for the engines.

676
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,704
(sighing)
Oxygen is the real problem.

677
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,044
- What do you mean?

678
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:48,117
- Above 13,000 feet, we're going
to start suffering from apoxia.

679
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,846
- Apoxia, what's apoxia?
- It's, uh, oxygen deprivation.

680
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,456
Shortness of breath,
headaches, nausea.

681
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,956
- I thought you said this thing
could go to 24,000 feet.

682
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,084
- It can, but most people
don't bring it above 10.

683
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,992
That's why there's no breathing gear.

684
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,294
Dammit! If my elevator worked,
I could do a controlled descent

685
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,560
and we could all get our bearings.

686
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,673
- Is there a way that we can clear
the jam, like an access panel, or...

687
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,968
- There's nothing we can do from here.

688
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:15,306
Somebody would have to go outside
and do it manually.

689
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,711
- What do you mean go outside?
On the tail?

690
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,756
- No, no, no.
Screw that, we're not doing that.

691
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:34,922
It's ridiculous.

692
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,295
- That's your attitude for everything,
isn't it? Just give up.

693
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,925
- What, do you wanna go out there?

694
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,400
Huh?

695
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,938
Be my guest.

696
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,055
- Oh no...

697
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,161
- What now?

698
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,426
- The de-icing boots are malfunctioning.

699
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,557
- What?

700
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,432
- They keep ice
from building up on the wings.

701
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,472
- Aren't you supposed to check
all this shit before--?

702
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,802
- I didn't know we were going
to be flying this high.

703
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,535
- So ice builds up,
what does that mean?

704
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,203
- It means we don't generate
enough lift.

705
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,508
And if it blocks the ailerons
then we're really screwed.

706
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,447
- Oh, perfect.

707
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,887
- Mel, what's wrong, you okay?

708
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,581
- Just a... headache.

709
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,596
What are you doing?

710
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,494
- You heard her,
we just ran out of options.

711
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,298
- Cory, you're not going out there.
- Beats sitting in here waiting to die.

712
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,428
- No, Cory, you can't go out there.

713
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,437
Nothing to hang onto,
you'll be blown right off.

714
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,734
- That's what the rope's for.

715
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,276
- Listen to her okay?
She knows what she's talking about.

716
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,139
- Look, take this with you at least.
- The parachute?

717
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,478
Look, I've been free climbing
since I was 12, okay?

718
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,847
It'll only slow me down.

719
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,046
- My hero.
- Do you want to go out there?

720
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,384
Huh? Feel free.

721
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,584
- Be my guest.

722
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,285
- It might not even work.

723
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:15,091
- What?
Look, will it or won't it?

724
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,666
Sara, you're the expert here.
Will this work?

725
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,531
Or won't it?

726
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:26,098
- Enough pressure on the elevator
will be able to free it.

727
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,767
So, yeah.
- Okay.

728
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,470
- Alright, can you slow us down?

729
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,579
- I'll try.
- Help me!

730
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,181
- There's gotta be another option.

731
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,613
- No, there isn't.
- There's no other way, you heard her.

732
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,879
See that rope back there?
Get it and tie it to something.

733
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,115
Make sure it's tight.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

734
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,517
Piece of cake.

735
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,525
Who taught you how to tie a knot?

736
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,357
- It's a knot.
- What?

737
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,192
Like this.

738
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,425
Sure you're ready for this?
- What's that supposed to mean?

739
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,365
- It means you've been drinking, fuck-o.

740
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,472
- Oh my God, come on.
- Not now!

741
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,200
- I just need to know if I can trust you.

742
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,038
Gimme this.
- Is this enough for you, huh?

743
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,908
Are you satisfied now?
- Okay, okay.

744
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,640
- Let's fucking do this...
- Let's do it.

745
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,977
- Okay, I'm reducing power.

746
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,650
- Okay.

747
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,482
- Cory, come here.
- Yeah?

748
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,021
Yeah, what?

749
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,591
- Come back.
- Okay.

750
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,354
- No, promise me, you'll come back.

751
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:22,829
- I've done this a hundred times.
Okay, just not quite this high.

752
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,524
It's fine, fly okay?

753
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,731
It's okay, okay?

754
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,373
It's alright.

755
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,974
Just keep me in focus, okay?

756
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,235
Alright? Okay.

757
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,145
Okay, let's do it!

758
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,475
Come on.
(deep breaths)

759
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,560
Rock and roll.

760
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,614
- What's wrong?
- Our weight distribution's off.

761
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,274
We're not balanced.

762
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,188
- Cory!
- Jesus Christ, Sara! Come on!

763
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,795
- Sara!
- Come on. Okay.

764
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,374
Ooooh. That's better.

765
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,739
How's he doing?

766
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,039
- He's good, he's all right!

767
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:44,942
He's alright, right buddy?

768
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,447
- It's too far!

769
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,415
I think I gotta jump.

770
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:50,850
- What?

771
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,651
Are you crazy?

772
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,521
No!

773
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,626
Jesus...

774
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,301
There he is, he's here.
- Come on, Cory!

775
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,049
- There we go. There we go.

776
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,292
He's on the tail!
He's on the tail.

777
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,890
Come on...

778
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,169
Come on...

779
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,539
- Come on, Cory. Come on.

780
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,315
- I've got control back!
- He did it.

781
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,080
You did it bro! Ha ha!!!

782
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,293
(eerie howling)

783
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,296
Put that thing away
and come help me!

784
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,403
Come on!
- Okay!

785
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,767
- How's he doing back there?

786
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,239
- He's not going to make it,
he's freezing!

787
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,570
Gimme your hand!

788
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,939
Gimme your hand!

789
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,273
Come on, Cory!

790
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,144
For Chrissake, Sara,
keep it steady!

791
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,980
- I'm trying!

792
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,350
- Come on, Cory, I'm right here,
on the count of three,

793
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,287
you're gonna take my hand, alright?

794
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,386
Alright, ready? One...

795
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,586
two....

796
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,024
...three!

797
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,363
No!!

798
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,437
Jesus! Fuck!

799
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:49,630
Roll on!

800
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,439
Ah, shit!

801
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,275
Oh, my God!

802
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,651
(grunting)

803
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,324
(screaming)

804
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,160
- Do you have him?

805
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,199
Sal, what's happening?

806
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,733
- Oh, shit!

807
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,151
- Somebody talk to me.

808
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,888
Sal.

809
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,400
Sal.

810
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,836
Sal.

811
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,077
(sighing)

812
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,604
- He's gone.

813
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,007
- What?

814
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,953
- He's gone.

815
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,386
- No, no.

816
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,290
- The fucking rope broke.
He's gone.

817
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,792
(sobbing): No... oh, no.

818
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,462
- I saw something.

819
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,500
(sobbing): No, no, no.

820
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,505
- I thought I saw it before,
now I know.

821
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:33,940
- No, no.

822
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,908
- Could you just shut up and listen?

823
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,843
Shut up and listen to me.
It got him, I saw it.

824
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,713
It was huge, it was fucking huge.

825
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,445
It was black.

826
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,316
You didn't see it.

827
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,688
You didn't hear it.

828
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,820
Look aren't you listening to me?
It fucking grabbed him, I saw it!

829
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,865
- What does it matter?

830
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,491
Cory's dead.

831
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,174
- Yeah, well better him than us.

832
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,477
Just get us down now, right now.

833
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,638
- No.

834
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,977
- Just land this plane now.

835
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,288
Get it down, Sara!
- I will, I will.

836
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,548
- Right now....

837
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:20,782
Right now.

838
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,980
- Can anybody see anything?

839
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,645
- More goddamned cloud.

840
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,726
- What happened?

841
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,797
Where are we?

842
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,530
Why the hell am I tied up?

843
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,905
- It's for your own good.

844
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,245
- We're not climbing anymore.

845
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,354
- That's right.

846
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,588
We're going to be okay now.

847
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:04,385
- We are?

848
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,594
- Where's Cory?

849
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,107
Sara?

850
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,746
- You killed him.

851
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,256
He trusted you,

852
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,087
and you... killed him.

853
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,324
- What are you talking about, Mel?

854
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,967
- This didn't break.
It was cut.

855
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,566
- Are you listening to yourself
right now?

856
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:50,631
Huh?

857
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,106
You sound fucking crazy!

858
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,767
- He saved our lives!

859
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,709
- Where were you when I needed help
pulling him in, huh? Where were you?

860
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,818
- I was there.
- Oh well, I must have blinked.

861
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,180
- I hit my head.

862
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,413
- I'm sure you did.

863
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:09,457
But you know what?
None of that matters now.

864
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,026
Your boyfriend is gone.

865
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,759
- What?

866
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,797
- You heard me.

867
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,456
- Mel, it was an accident.

868
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,158
Okay? You know it was.

869
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,336
- You're fucking crazy.

870
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,632
- I'm the crazy one?
You just accused me of killing someone!

871
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,471
- Guys! Stop!

872
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,077
- Someone please tell me
what happened to Cory.

873
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,848
- He went outside on the tail
to fix the elevator.

874
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,450
Sal thinks something grabbed him.

875
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,886
- Look, I know what I saw.

876
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,254
Okay, I know what I saw!

877
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,190
It was real.

878
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,957
- What was? What was real?

879
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,158
- We don't know.
- Bullshit.

880
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,226
Bullshit! Bullshit!

881
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,065
There's a monster out there!

882
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,934
- Just shut up, okay?
Just shut up.

883
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,179
- How long are you going
to keep me tied up for?

884
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,248
- Until we know we can trust you.

885
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,948
- Of course you can trust me.

886
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,250
- Can I really?

887
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,826
- You completely lost it earlier
and you lied to me.

888
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,292
- About what?

889
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,028
- Your parents weren't killed
in a car crash, were they?

890
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,371
Were they?

891
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,035
- No.

892
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,043
- Mel, can you come up here, please?

893
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,050
Keep an eye out.

894
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,323
- For what?

895
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,858
- Anything.

896
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,706
You know how I said we were going
to have that talk later?

897
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,000
Look at me!

898
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,667
We're having it now.

899
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,107
- I knew your mother.

900
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,516
- What?

901
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,950
- I knew your mother.

902
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,284
- What are you talking about?

903
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,289
- I was there when it happened.

904
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,062
- When what happened?

905
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,225
- I was one of the passengers.

906
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,733
(frightened cries)

907
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,018
When they pulled me out of that lake,
half my bones were broken.

908
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,086
I spent six months in the hospital
just trying to walk again.

909
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,919
- So you're saying,
you're the Taylor's kid?

910
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,994
- I thought you said your last name
was Parker?

911
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,995
- The Parkers are my foster parents.

912
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,604
- So, you knew who I was
when we first met?

913
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,108
- I didn't want it to affect things
between us.

914
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,345
I, I knew you would freak out.
- Jesus, man.

915
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,348
Freak her out?

916
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,952
God, you guys are fucking
death magnets!

917
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,752
Jesus, we're so fucked!

918
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,121
We're so fucked!

919
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,728
(screaming)

920
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,490
- What did you think would happen
when I went off to McGill?

921
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,066
You think I'd fly home every
other weekend to see you?

922
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:43,263
Our lives are going
in different directions.

923
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:48,300
You're so different
than I thought you were.

924
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,275
You're a liar.

925
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,144
You make up this story
like you know my mom.

926
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,784
That's a sick, bullshit fantasy.

927
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,614
You had to know that this,
this couldn't last.

928
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,687
You had to know that,
tell me, you knew that.

929
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,688
- Fantasy?

930
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,988
A fantasy?

931
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,892
Your mom killed my parents!

932
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,664
My life is so screwed up!

933
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,237
Your mom destroyed my life!

934
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,937
- You don't know shit.

935
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,237
- I figured it out though.

936
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,877
- Figured what out, Bruce?

937
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,778
- We're meant to be together, Sara.
- Meant to be together?

938
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,044
Are you crazy?
- I love you.

939
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,311
What did you just say?

940
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,989
- I love you.

941
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,058
- Don't say that.

942
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:44,029
Don't say that.

943
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,575
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray.

944
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,019
Position and altitude unknown,
can anybody read me?

945
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,183
- Can someone please
untie these ropes?

946
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,460
- Sure, I'll get right to it.

947
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,133
- Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray.

948
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,827
(eerie howling)

949
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:26,700
- What is it?

950
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,809
- I don't know.

951
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:33,906
- Let us hear it.

952
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,222
(eerie howling)

953
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,254
It's that thing.

954
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,923
(eerie howling)

955
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,126
It's that thing, it's back.

956
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,566
It's back.

957
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,500
- No, it's distortion.
It has to be.

958
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,971
- Oh, come on.
That's not distortion.

959
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,343
- Well, whatever it is,
there's a rational explanation.

960
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,878
- Well good, 'cause I think
we'd all like to hear it, Sara!

961
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,503
- What do you want me to say?

962
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,014
Okay, apoxia makes you see things,
or hear things.

963
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,151
- But not the same things.

964
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,412
Look, the altimeter says
we should be in outer space.

965
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,886
How do you explain that right now?
- Some magnetic interference.

966
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,719
- Sara, you heard it, it's not normal.

967
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,521
- Yeah, I heard something.

968
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,789
It could be crosstalk or interference
with sunspots, something.

969
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,764
- Oh my god, sunspots?
Are you kidding me?

970
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,629
- You're not a radio expert, Sal!

971
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,634
None of us are.

972
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,538
- Alright, alright, let's just be real.

973
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:36,475
I think there's something we all need
to admit right now, don't you think?

974
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:37,875
- Admit what?

975
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,675
- Come on, Sara.

976
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,377
We've been going down
for what, like 20 minutes?

977
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,318
Tell me you're not thinking
the same thing I am!

978
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,423
- Spit it out.

979
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,232
- Where the hell is the ground?

980
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,782
(shivering)

981
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:23,259
(heavy breathing)

982
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,659
(heavy breathing)

983
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:29,823
- Sara.

984
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:35,328
Sara, your dad,
he works on secret projects, right?

985
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,166
- Yeah, Mel, what--
- Like for the Air Force?

986
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,864
- Yeah...
- Yeah, good point.

987
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:42,068
Yeah, remember the mechanic we saw,
the camel jockey?

988
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,839
Well, maybe, just maybe,
he rigged the plane

989
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,574
to kill the Colonel's daughter.
How's that?

990
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,277
- Look, that's not what I meant.

991
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,978
Okay, what if we don't need
to come down?

992
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,283
What if we never took off?

993
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,823
- Mel.

994
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,985
- Just hear me out, what if we're just
part of some big experiment,

995
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,529
you know, something to see
how people react to stress.

996
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:05,429
- Mel, that's impossible.

997
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:06,500
- Why?

998
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,603
- Because he doesn't even know
we're here.

999
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,032
- What?

1000
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,101
- What?

1001
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,845
- He thinks we were driving
to the concert.

1002
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,039
He doesn't even know
I have my pilot's license.

1003
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,580
- Are you shitting me, Sara?
- He's paranoid!

1004
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,981
He's convinced I'll end up
the same way my mom did!

1005
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,450
- Well, Jesus!
I wonder what gave him that idea!

1006
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:27,783
- It has nothing to do with that okay?

1007
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,484
The point is, it's not some giant
government conspiracy.

1008
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:34,194
- Why not?
- This doesn't happen in real life.

1009
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,628
- There wasn't any information
released on the plane that hit us.

1010
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:37,790
- What plane?

1011
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,765
- The one that killed her mom
and my parents.

1012
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,234
There's no record of it,
it just appeared out of nowhere.

1013
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:43,703
- The ghost plane theory? Really?

1014
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,638
- It's just that we're trapped
in a hanger,

1015
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,744
we're plugged into some sort
of simulation or...

1016
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,640
maybe it's drugs, you know,

1017
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,271
like those LSD tests they did
back in the '60s.

1018
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,349
- One of hell of a bad trip we're having.

1019
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,386
- It makes more sense
than anything else!

1020
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,352
(heavy breathing)

1021
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,655
- Well shit, I say we find out.

1022
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,889
- How?
- I don't know... jump!

1023
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,933
I mean, in dreams, I don't know,
you're falling and you wake up,

1024
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,935
Maybe it's the same
in this situation, huh?

1025
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,936
Maybe it's the same.

1026
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,371
(heavy breathing)

1027
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,067
- You know what?
I think you're onto something,

1028
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,201
why don't you go ahead
and give it a shot.

1029
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,247
- Well maybe it's just
the booze talking, I don't know.

1030
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,782
I don't know!

1031
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,942
But right now, right now,

1032
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,612
it's saying shut the fuck up
and drink me.

1033
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,883
So you know what?

1034
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,289
I'm gonna do just that.

1035
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,519
Cheers.

1036
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:42,758
- Ahh!!!

1037
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,703
(laughing)

1038
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,862
- Wake up, Sara...

1039
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,000
Sara...

1040
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:28,635
Sara...

1041
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,642
Wake up, Sara.

1042
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,013
Sara, wake up!

1043
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,689
Sara!

1044
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,456
(heavy breathing)

1045
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,019
Sara!

1046
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,328
- Sara!

1047
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,555
Sara, wake up!!!

1048
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,063
Sara!

1049
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,462
Sara, wake up!!!

1050
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:56,264
Something hit us
and we need you to fly the plane.

1051
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,134
Sara!

1052
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,215
Sara!

1053
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,677
Sara!

1054
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,352
Come on, quick!

1055
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,194
- Jesus...

1056
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:33,868
- Come on!

1057
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,811
- Ah!

1058
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,378
(screaming)

1059
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:53,586
- Sara!

1060
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,604
(sobbing)

1061
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,512
I can't take this.

1062
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,306
I can't take this anymore.

1063
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,854
- No, no, Mel, stay with me,
stay with me.

1064
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,456
Mel.

1065
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,653
It's going to be okay.
I promise.

1066
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:25,953
Okay?

1067
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,326
It's going to be okay.
(sobbing)

1068
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,407
(sobbing)

1069
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,231
(eerie howling)

1070
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,607
(eerie howling)

1071
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,675
- What's that?
- Oh no...

1072
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,174
(growling)

1073
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,146
(screaming)

1074
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,510
- What? It's got us!

1075
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,879
- What is it?
- Sara!

1076
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,125
- Am I the only one
that's gone completely insane!

1077
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,491
Did anybody else just hallucinate
something attacking us?!

1078
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,495
- Calm down, Sal.
- Calm down?!!!

1079
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,065
That thing's going to rip us apart!

1080
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,997
- Well whatever it is, it's gone, okay?
Just relax.

1081
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:42,434
- You would say that,
'cause you put us in this situation.

1082
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,072
- This isn't about me, okay?

1083
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,730
This isn't my fault.

1084
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,742
Bruce, what are you doing?

1085
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,744
Bruce, stop it, I'm serious.

1086
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,007
- Sal...

1087
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,580
Sal, I think I took too many,

1088
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,380
I think I took many...
- Mel... Mel!

1089
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,584
Mel!
Mel, Jesus Christ, Mel!

1090
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,751
Oh come on, no, no,
don't do this, come on.

1091
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,193
Come on... baby, baby.

1092
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,059
Something's wrong with Mel!

1093
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,495
- What happened to her?
- Don't know.

1094
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,999
I, uh, can't feel a pulse.

1095
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,625
I think she OD'd!
- OD'd on what?

1096
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,000
- On her fucking pills,
what do you think she OD'd on?

1097
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,664
Mel... oh baby oh, no, no, no...

1098
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,437
- We got to get her breathing!
- Mel, come on!

1099
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,006
- Please, please help her!

1100
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,944
Please!
- What the fuck are you doing?!

1101
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,072
- Move, move!

1102
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,715
- Don't you fucking hurt her!

1103
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,450
- Please.

1104
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,287
- Jesus Christ, Mel!

1105
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:46,558
- Come on. Come on, baby!

1106
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,533
Come on. Come on.

1107
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,468
Don't you fucking hurt her!
Don't hurt her!

1108
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,009
Don't you fucking hurt her!
Don't hurt her.

1109
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,552
(coughing and vomiting)

1110
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,552
- Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
I'm here, I'm here.

1111
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,284
Come on, I'm here.

1112
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,056
- Oh, thank God.

1113
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,029
- Here we go, here we go.

1114
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,531
You're okay, come here.

1115
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,099
You're okay, come here.

1116
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,074
There you go, baby.

1117
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,513
(sobbing)

1118
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,114
You're okay.

1119
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,518
Look, baby, I never...

1120
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,921
I never meant to say those things.

1121
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,220
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it,
I swear.

1122
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,463
I didn't mean those things
I said to you.

1123
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:49,791
- Sal...

1124
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,899
- What, what, baby, what?

1125
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,763
It's okay, what?
- About Cory...

1126
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,871
- No, we don't need
to talk about that now.

1127
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,097
We don't need
to talk about that now, baby.

1128
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,471
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't, no we don't.

1129
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,902
- I'm so sorry.

1130
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:07,777
- It's okay, it's okay, baby.

1131
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,149
- I'm so sorry.

1132
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,846
I never meant to hurt you...
(crashing)

1133
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,021
- Mel!!!!!

1134
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,828
(screaming)

1135
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,524
(screaming and crying)

1136
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,828
- What the hell was that?

1137
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,804
(screaming)

1138
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,908
- It got her, it fucking got her,
and it's gonna get us too...

1139
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,675
It's gonna fucking get us too!

1140
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,875
(crying)

1141
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:53,058
- There's no way... it can't be...

1142
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,428
There's no way.
- What did you do?

1143
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,464
What did you do, you fuck?!!!

1144
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,897
What the fuck did you do,
you fucker?!

1145
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,267
- Sal, Sal...
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1146
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:06,306
- No, no, please no!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1147
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:09,172
- No! Sal!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1148
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,478
- No!

1149
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,812
Sal! Let him go!

1150
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,880
Sal!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1151
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,514
- Stop it, Sal!

1152
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,794
- You fuck!
(screaming)

1153
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:32,965
- Sara, help me up!

1154
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,468
Don't let go of me!
- Come here.

1155
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,709
(turbulence)

1156
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:50,874
Don't let go of me!

1157
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,682
Please, don't let go of me!
- I got you.

1158
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,187
- Nooo!

1159
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,458
(screaming)

1160
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,930
(crying)

1161
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,205
(screaming)

1162
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:07,486
- They're dead.

1163
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,422
They're all dead.

1164
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,199
God, what have I done?

1165
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,469
What have I done?

1166
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,210
- It's not your fault.

1167
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,245
- Yes, it is.

1168
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,974
I'm the pilot.

1169
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,785
I'm responsible.

1170
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,593
He knew it.

1171
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,590
He knew it.

1172
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,237
My dad knew it.

1173
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,203
He knew it from the day we buried her.

1174
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,348
I wasn't allowed to see her body.

1175
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,355
All I remember is the flowers
on her casket.

1176
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,593
Tulips.

1177
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,495
Tulips were her favourite.

1178
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:27,832
God, I miss her.

1179
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,803
I miss her so much.

1180
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,050
I never believed she was really gone.

1181
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:49,130
I thought, thought maybe
she was lost somewhere up there,

1182
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:53,598
and that, if I learned to fly I could,

1183
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,135
I could find her and bring her home.

1184
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,043
I want her to come home.

1185
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,980
- This happened before
and it's happening again.

1186
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:11,912
- No.

1187
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,577
Bruce, no.

1188
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:17,715
This isn't about your parents,
or my mom,

1189
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,760
or any conspiracy, okay?
It's not about that.

1190
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,322
- You're right, Sara.
I know that now.

1191
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,395
- Then what?

1192
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,094
- It's me.

1193
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,271
- What are you talking about?

1194
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:43,516
- Ten years ago on that plane,
I saw...

1195
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,745
I saw something... I...

1196
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,318
There was a storm...

1197
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,823
Turbulence...

1198
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,698
The cover of a magazine.

1199
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,424
I was scared.

1200
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,566
I imagined it happening to us.

1201
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,406
It did.

1202
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,579
- No, that's insane.
That's just a coincidence.

1203
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,184
- Then what do you call this, huh?

1204
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,249
- What?

1205
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,918
The comic?

1206
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,292
- Just look.

1207
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,330
- What?

1208
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,227
- We should probably turn around.
- I'm trying.

1209
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,963
- 20,000 feet?
- Where the hell is the ground?

1210
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:44,106
- You killed him.
- This didn't break, it was cut.

1211
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,516
- What are you saying?

1212
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,022
This is... this is some kind of curse?

1213
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,352
- Aren't you listening?

1214
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,291
I made these things come true
just by thinking about them.

1215
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,224
I should have never gotten
on this plane.

1216
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,458
- Why, because you're scared to fly?
- Don't you get it?

1217
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,364
That's when it happens,
when I'm really scared.

1218
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,030
- So you're telling me that this is
some kind of fantasy world come to life?

1219
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,903
- Sara, look around,
this isn't a fantasy,

1220
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:15,907
it's a nightmare.

1221
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,878
(eerie howling)

1222
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,710
- I'm not gonna let us die!

1223
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,051
- You're never gonna outfly it!

1224
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,280
- We'll see. Hang on!

1225
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,822
(roaring)

1226
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:41,767
(roaring)

1227
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:49,668
- Oh shit.

1228
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:51,073
Shit... shit!

1229
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,680
(screaming)

1230
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,489
Another hit like that and we're dead.

1231
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:12,464
- I told you, I told you, I told you...

1232
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,966
- Are you really causing this?

1233
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,333
Is this really because of you?

1234
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:24,035
Then prove it.
Make that thing go away!

1235
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,771
- I don't know how.

1236
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,815
- Make it go away!
- I don't know how!

1237
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:31,712
- Bruce...

1238
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:35,220
Man is what he wills himself to be.

1239
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,654
Sartre, right?

1240
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:41,324
Stop being such a pussy
and face your fears.

1241
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,930
Face your fears!

1242
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,468
(roaring)
(screaming)

1243
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:05,517
(screaming)

1244
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,916
(roaring)

1245
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,516
Bruce!

1246
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,091
Bruce!!

1247
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,045
Jesus...

1248
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,209
it is you.

1249
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,762
(panting)

1250
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:55,635
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray,

1251
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,998
can anyone read me?

1252
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,630
(static)

1253
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,933
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
Yankee Zulu X-ray.

1254
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,070
(static)

1255
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,407
-... This is Lakeview Centre,

1256
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,709
received your Mayday.
What is your emergency?

1257
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,579
- I just got through to ground.

1258
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,511
We're gonna make it.

1259
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,726
- You didn't mean it, did you?

1260
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:28,600
- Mean what?

1261
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:31,299
- That kiss.

1262
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,077
- I care about you, Bruce.

1263
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,039
You know that.

1264
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:46,721
Bruce.

1265
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,185
Bruce!
- I can't help it.

1266
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,551
- Yes, you can!

1267
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,458
Oh, no!

1268
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,022
Bruce! No!

1269
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,261
(glass breaking)

1270
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:15,115
(roaring)

1271
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,582
Get us out of here!
- It's not that simple!

1272
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,051
- Why not?
Just think us somewhere else!

1273
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,214
- You don't understand, I've never made
anything good happen in my life.

1274
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:25,451
What if I can't?

1275
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,754
(screaming)

1276
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:27,953
Sara!

1277
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,119
Nooooo!!!

1278
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:30,594
- Bruce!

1279
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:36,996
- Sara!

1280
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,772
- Bruce!!!

1281
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:49,349
- Sara!!!!
- Your parents, Bruce!

1282
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,185
Think of your parents!

1283
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,084
- My parents?

1284
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:58,192
- They wouldn't want you to die
like this, they'd want you to survive.

1285
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,092
Don't you understand?

1286
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:06,132
You can be with them again,
all you have to do is imagine it!

1287
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,095
- Sara!
- Imagine it!

1288
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,705
- Nooo!!!!

1289
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,986
(heavy breathing)

1290
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,599
- What happened?

1291
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,834
- I did it.
I thought us somewhere else.

1292
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:54,939
- Oh no!

1293
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,533
(screaming)

1294
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,264
(screaming)

1295
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:32,945
- Where the hell did he come from?

1296
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,151
(panting)

1297
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,086
- Was that...?

1298
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,923
- I think so.

1299
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,122
- Did we just...?
- Yeah.

1300
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,115
- If you're gonna do your thing...

1301
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,114
now's the time.

1302
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,548
- It's already done.

1303
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:50,221
- Mom! Mom!

1304
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,825
- I'm okay, sweetie.

1305
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,106
Everybody gets one near miss, right?

1306
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,102
- Do you think they made it?

1307
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,749
- I hope so.

1308
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,652
- Hi, I'm Sara.

1309
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,660
- Bruce.
