168
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,656
Our last tenant
was a little messy,

169
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,659
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.

170
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,194
It's gonna brighten it up
quite a bit.

171
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,063
Let's take a look
at your bedroom, sweetie.

172
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,832
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.

173
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:39,636
What do you think? Isn't that great?
There's no air in here.

174
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:43,073
Of course there's air in here. If there
wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.

175
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:47,145
That window does not open, but it lets a
lot of natural light in in the afternoon.

176
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:48,162
It's really great.

177
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,047
<i>DAHLIA: Strange.
MURRAY: I kinda like it.</i>

178
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,516
In the afternoon, it brightens
the place up quite a bit.

179
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,784
Anyway, here's the closet.

180
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,302
You could put your dollies
in there

181
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:59,539
or, you know, Mom could use it
for storage.

182
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,945
Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
OK.

183
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,848
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?

184
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,900
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.

185
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,236
The bathroom's pretty
self-explanatory.

186
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,538
It's in decent shape.
Once we clean it up.

187
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,841
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.

188
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,310
This glass is safety glass.

189
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:24,181
I mean, you could hit that as hard
as you want - it will not break.

190
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,016
And that is great for your
peace of mind, you know,

191
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,385
when Ceci's taking a bath
or what have you.

192
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,737
<i>DAHLIA: Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.</i>

193
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,226
Ah, you're right. That's much better.
You can smell the river.

194
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,661
<i>Can you smell that?
DAHLIA: Yeah.</i>

195
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,963
Let me show you the other
bedroom here.

196
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,365
You know, it's tough to get
two bedrooms in Manhattan

197
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,702
or any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.

198
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,854
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that.

199
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:52,225
That's a closet.
Um... Kitchen.

200
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,595
Got the refrigerator,
sink, stove,

201
00:11:55,597 --> 00:12:00,600
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.

202
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,570
You see this. It's just really
smart how they did this.

203
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:06,406
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.

204
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,642
You can put your stools around it
or whatever, and when you're done,

205
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,677
out of the way, no clutter.

206
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,014
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.

207
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:17,283
Kitchen. OK.

208
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,920
And then here
is the other bedroom.

209
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:25,224
So, where's the living room?

210
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,844
Well, it's kind of
a living-room-slash-bedroom.

211
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,345
It's called a dual-use room.

212
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,347
You can see it's the size
of two rooms. It's huge.

213
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,050
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?

214
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,754
Look at that. That is a million-dollar
view for $900 a month.

215
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,856
I mean, I don't even
have that where I live.

216
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,509
You're not gonna do better
than that. I guarantee it.

217
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:13,073
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.

218
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,108
We could have this painted
this weekend.

219
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,410
You could move in on Monday,
and, you know,

220
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,045
we could just fill out
the forms right now.

221
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:22,499
I understand you want some time
to walk around, think about it.

222
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,601
Let me just check on Ceci.
Sure, sure. Yeah.

223
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,870
Ceci.

224
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,889
She's just making herself
at home. It's OK, Mom.

225
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,108
Ceci.

226
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,444
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.

227
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:58,285
Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.

228
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,487
Did my daughter come down here?
What?

229
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:01,889
My daughter.
The little girl that I came with.

230
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,837
The little girl.
Did she get on the elevator?

231
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:05,993
No. I see no one.
Just him.

232
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:09,263
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.

233
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,535
Ceci.

234
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,657
Ceci.

235
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,867
Ceci.

236
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,504
Ceci. Are you in there?

237
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,172
<i>MURRAY: Hello?
Yeah?</i>

238
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,642
What are you doing down here?
I saw someone go in.

239
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,444
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?

240
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:45,849
Ceci!

241
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:52,823
Look, Mommy. Hello Kitty.
I got a Hello Kitty bag.

242
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,457
Ceci. Ceci!

243
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,827
Don't you ever do that again!
Do you understand?

244
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,598
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,233
Sorry.
Do you understand me?

246
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,236
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.

247
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,704
Sorry, Mommy.
OK?

248
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,807
How can you leave this unlocked?
There's no railing here.

249
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,175
It's totally irresponsible,

250
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,278
It's supposed to be locked.
Well, it wasn't.

251
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,147
Yeah. Sorry.

252
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,349
Are you OK, honey?
Yeah.

253
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,586
<i>[MURRAY SIGHS]</i>

254
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,587
<i>[LOCKS DOOR]</i>

255
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,326
You're so lucky
you found that.

256
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,314
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?

257
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,633
No. Mommy, can I look?
It's not yours, sweetie.

258
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,970
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it.
There's no other children in the building.

259
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,357
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.

260
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,425
Oh, they all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.

261
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:49,195
You know, hardly anybody ever
moves out 'cause of rent control.

262
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:51,197
Oh, there are other children
on the island.

263
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,832
You know,
in the other buildings.

264
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,035
You would have
many, many friends.

265
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:59,088
So cute.

266
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,358
Mr. Veeck, why was the door
to the roof open?

267
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,627
What?
The roof.

268
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,995
My daughter found this
on the roof.

269
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:08,665
The roof? Where?
Just lying there.

270
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,969
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?

271
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,553
I did.
No.

272
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,122
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?

273
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:19,092
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.

274
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,561
You get fired for cause, and you
can kiss that pension goodbye.

275
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,663
What do you talk about?
I check it.

276
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,365
Hour ago, it was locked.
Someone else open it.

277
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,934
Well, whose bag is this?
What do I know?

278
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:32,422
Well, look inside it, please.
I'm so sorry about this.

279
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,691
As you can see, we're having a little
bit of a communication problem.

280
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,076
We'll get it worked out.

281
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,961
<i>DAHLIA: I was wondering
if you have a card, so...</i>

282
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,447
<i>MURRAY: Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.</i>

283
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,198
<i>Just don't wait too long.
VEECK: Hey. Hey.</i>

284
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,469
Ceci.
That's not yours. OK?

285
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,387
You can't keep that.
Look, it's brand-new.

286
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,022
Someone's gonna come back
for it.

287
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:51,425
Can you give it back,
please?

288
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,427
Doll.
Ceci.

289
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,129
<i>MURRAY: Aw. Poor thing.
DAHLIA: Good girl. Thank you.</i>

290
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,466
I'll tell you what. Mr. Veeck
will hold on to it for a week,

291
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:02,502
and if no one comes, then you
can come by and get it. OK?

292
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,771
In one week.
No one comes, it's yours.

293
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,489
You see? You'll see,
no one will come.

294
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:09,176
Thank you, Mr. Veeck.
Please check on that lock again.

295
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,843
<i>DAHLIA: Thank you.</i>

296
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,812
We're gonna live here,
right, Mommy?

297
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,415
What?
We're gonna move here, right?

298
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,085
I want to.
I really wanna move here.

299
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,353
See?
From the mouths of babes.

300
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:23,523
<i>DAHLIA: Excuse me just one moment.
OK.</i>

301
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,925
<i>DAHLIA: Talk about it,
I guess.</i>

302
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,927
Now, we don't have
to move here

303
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:29,963
for you to get
a Hello Kitty backpack.

304
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,264
I know that.
You know that?

305
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:34,734
I really like this place, Mommy.
I wanna live here.

306
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,804
You said it was
the right kind of price for us.

307
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,508
I did say that. It's a little
bit smaller than I hoped.

308
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,311
Please, Mommy.
Can we live here?

309
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,013
I'm over here.
Over here.

310
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,482
Over here.

311
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,424
We'll take it.
Oh, I have the Bernsteins...

312
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,993
I'll give you a deposit
right now.

313
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,863
You're sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.

314
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,632
OK.
OK.

315
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,934
Yeah. I have the forms here.
If want, we can go in...

316
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,436
Let's go back in the office.
OK.

317
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,738
Ceci, you wanna come?

318
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,174
I'll be right back.
I can explain to them.

319
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,009
That's all right.
They have a lot of choices.

320
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,701
<i>Come on.</i>

321
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:19,462
<i>KYLE: 'Cause it's insanely
inconvenient, that's why.</i>

322
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,047
I gotta drive
through the tunnel,

323
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,165
get uptown to cross the 59th
Street Bridge to Queens,

324
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,068
so I can cross another goddamn
bridge to get to the island.

325
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,819
You could take the subway.
The subway?

326
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,821
You want me to take the PATH to the F?
Are you kidding me?

327
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,424
It'll take a hour.
I'm suing.

328
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:31,786
What?

329
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,226
You move there, and I'm
suing for full custody.

330
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:36,062
Mr. Williams.

775
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:38,471
I'm gonna speak with Murray

776
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:41,508
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.

777
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,043
He's probably not coming back anyway.
OK.

You want a beer?
I don't drink beer.

you're mentally unstable

because your father
was physically abusive

that your husband says

Her father's abandoned her

969
01:05:50,456 --> 01:05:54,692
and she was forced to move
from her neighborhood, so...

970
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:57,779
she's developed
an imaginary friend.
