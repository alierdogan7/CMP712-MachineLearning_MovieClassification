1
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,350
<i>Mom?</i>

2
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,628
<i>Come on, guys, push it!</i>

3
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,962
<i>Move when you got the ball!
Nobody's moving there.</i>

4
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:49,966
<i>Know where your teammates are!</i>

5
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:52,932
<i>All right, hold up. Hold it up.</i>

6
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,029
<i>New ball.
We are going to play with this ball.</i>

7
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,141
<i>Invisible.</i>

8
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,768
<i>It's funny. You think it's silly.</i>

9
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,797
<i>Practice is the place
it's okay to feel silly.</i>

10
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:07,986
<i>The practice floor.</i>

11
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,517
<i>Not with people watching you play.</i>

12
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,736
<i>Alright, you guys.
Run a couple plays.</i>

13
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:13,842
<i>Set it up. Three game.</i>

14
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,350
<i>Where's the ball?</i>

15
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,644
<i>- In my mind, coach.
- It is in your mind.</i>

16
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:21,148
<i>One brain! There you go!
That's the way to move it!</i>

17
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,814
<i>You play better with the
invisible than the real ball.</i>

18
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,174
<i>-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey, how are you?</i>

19
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,182
<i>Good, how are you?</i>

20
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:38,881
<i>You spas.
Yeah, I was there all alone.</i>

21
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:39,895
<i>-Hi.
-Hey.</i>

22
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,260
<i>You're late.</i>

23
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,476
<i>Practice ran long.</i>

24
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,232
<i>Oh, uh, Clyde, shoes, please?</i>

25
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:59,521
<i>What is this?</i>

26
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:02,604
<i>I needed work space for the business.
We're up and running.</i>

27
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,542
<i>Hmm.</i>

28
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,879
<i>Yeah.</i>

29
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,894
<i>The jewellery design. I told
you I was getting back into it.</i>

30
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,010
<i>Stephanie, I had a bunch of stuff in here.</i>

31
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:19,838
<i>I boxed up your stuff.
Your name's on it.</i>

32
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,775
<i>Everything's in the closet.</i>

33
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:26,256
<i>Don't you think I should
have packed up my office?</i>

34
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:28,354
<i>It's not your office anymore.</i>

35
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,582
<i>Hey, kiddo. You ready to go?</i>

36
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:47,891
<i>Which one you think is a better slogan?</i>

37
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,114
<i>"Stop The Killing, Eat Vegetables...</i>

38
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,168
<i>...or When You Eat Animals,
You Become One?</i>

39
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,897
<i>First of all, that is awesome...</i>

40
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,300
<i>...but Stop The Killing
is super catchy.</i>

41
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,923
<i>-Get my message?
-Loud and clear.</i>

42
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:05,266
<i>Miss Shandy said that if we get
200 signatures on our petition...</i>

43
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,644
<i>...she will
take it to the principal...</i>

44
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,457
<i>...and they'll consider
meat-free Mondays.</i>

45
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,981
<i>Wow, that will make you so popular.</i>

46
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,921
<i>Dad, were all one big
family on this planet...</i>

47
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,051
<i>...no matter what species...</i>

48
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:19,178
<i>...and we don't eat family, do we?</i>

49
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,791
<i>No, we certainly do not.</i>

50
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,420
<i>-Hi, Clyde.
-Hey.</i>

51
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:28,080
<i>Careful. You are entering
a shoe-free zone.</i>

52
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,652
<i>I know. I got that
sign for Stephanie.</i>

53
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,887
<i>You wouldn't believe
what's dragged indoors.</i>

54
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:34,849
<i>I'm sure I wouldn't.</i>

55
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,891
<i>-Hey!
-Hi.</i>

56
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,426
<i>What are you up to tonight?</i>

57
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,962
<i>-Going to a concert.
-Nice.</i>

58
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:42,946
<i>Season tickets. Wagner.</i>

59
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:47,144
<i>Wagner? Stephanie loves Wagner,
don't you, dear?</i>

60
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,940
<i>I'll have them back Sunday after lunch.</i>

61
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,798
<i>Okay.</i>

62
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:57,017
<i>Em's still vegetarian, so keep an eye
on her, and her allergies, please.</i>

63
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,577
<i>Last time she got hives.</i>

64
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:01,660
<i>And healthy food,
stuff that grows on trees.</i>

65
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,185
<i>No pizza, please. I mean it.</i>

66
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:04,957
<i>You done?</i>

67
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,335
<i>Yes.</i>

68
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,438
<i>-Stephanie...
-Yes?</i>

69
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,404
<i>I think I got this.</i>

70
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,657
<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

71
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,553
<i>-Bye, you guys! I love you!
-Bye!</i>

72
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:25,002
<i>-Brett says I have an overbite.
-Give me a break, your teeth are fine.</i>

73
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:28,521
<i>Brett's job is to tell
people they have bad teeth.</i>

74
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:29,581
<i>That's how he makes money.</i>

75
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,043
<i>He said he'd fix it for free.</i>

76
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,263
<i>Uh, Dad?</i>

77
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,801
<i>Yeah?</i>

78
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,109
<i>You passed your apartment.</i>

79
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,172
<i>Oh, I did, didn't I?</i>

80
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,337
<i>Ta-dah!</i>

81
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:42,492
<i>What is it?</i>

82
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:45,045
<i>What is it? This is our new house.</i>

83
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:47,633
<i>-It's in the middle of nowhere.
-Isn't it awesome?</i>

84
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,911
<i>And critters come by from the woods.</i>

85
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:52,363
<i>Yesterday, two raccoons on our porch.</i>

86
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:53,172
<i>Really?</i>

87
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,615
<i>Come on, Mopey McGee.</i>

88
00:07:56,568 --> 00:08:00,922
<i>Wow, this is pretty cool.</i>

89
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,336
<i>Right? Bedrooms are upstairs.</i>

90
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,613
<i>I call the room facing the woods!</i>

91
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,798
<i>You got it. That's your room.</i>

92
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,800
<i>Dad, there's a doggie door!</i>

93
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,059
<i>Lets get a dog from
the shelter. Please.</i>

94
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,918
<i>Please, please, please, please.</i>

95
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,720
<i>You've got to be kidding me.
This does not work on me anymore.</i>

96
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:30,472
<i>Daddy, yes, it does. Please.</i>

97
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:34,555
<i>Cheers.</i>

98
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,653
<i>-Cheers.
-Cheers.</i>

99
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,455
<i>I think Mom would
really like this house.</i>

100
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:42,874
<i>We should invite her for breakfast.</i>

101
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:47,737
<i>Mom and Dad officially
divorced three months ago.</i>

102
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,596
<i>Mom's not coming for pancakes.</i>

103
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,618
<i>-That's enough.
-Its getting old.</i>

104
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:54,394
<i>She thinks you're
getting back together.</i>

105
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:59,571
<i>Em, your mom and I,
we just sort of, uh...</i>

106
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,463
<i>...we forgot how to get along.</i>

107
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:05,684
<i>And you both are moving on with your lives.</i>

108
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:09,137
<i>I know. That's what Mom always says.</i>

109
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,888
<i>Your mom says that?</i>

110
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:18,195
<i>Okay. Then, there you have it.
You know, it’s for the best.</i>

111
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:22,786
<i>Okay? So let's have our dinner.</i>

112
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:24,878
<i>I'm not hungry anymore.</i>

113
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,130
<i>Alright, clear your plate.</i>

114
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,265
<i>Hannah...</i>

115
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,508
<i>You can't say that. It upsets your sister.</i>

116
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:45,775
<i>For real?
You're going to blame this on me?</i>

117
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:48,369
<i>Nice, Dad.</i>

118
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:56,657
<i>"Walk a little faster,"
said the whiting to the snail.</i>

119
00:09:56,658 --> 00:10:01,004
<i>"There's a porpoise close behind us,
and he's treading on my tail."</i>

120
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:02,543
<i>How was your day today?</i>

121
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:05,384
<i>Okay. How was yours?</i>

122
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,816
<i>Dinner was a failure.</i>

123
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,848
<i>Make sure Mom doesn't
find out about dinner.</i>

124
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:12,771
<i>She'll be mad pizza
doesn't grow on trees.</i>

125
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:15,202
<i>I'll give you $5 if
you don't tell your mother.</i>

126
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:18,235
<i>Make it 35 and we have a deal.</i>

127
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,292
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

128
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,841
<i>Leave the door open.</i>

129
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,132
<i>What's the matter? You scared?</i>

130
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,937
<i>No. Just... I want it open, okay?</i>

131
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,828
<i>Dad, you need dishes.</i>

132
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,635
<i>Okay.</i>

133
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:50,241
<i>Hey, Clyde, its Trevor down at NC.</i>

134
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:52,890
<i>Call me. I want to talk to you.</i>

135
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:54,039
<i>Hope you're good, pal.</i>

136
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,377
<i>Dad, look! I'm a lady.</i>

137
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,836
<i>Cool.</i>

138
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:39,848
<i>-Daddy, can I get this?
-That is a lovely hat.</i>

139
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,028
<i>Whatever you want, kiddo.</i>

140
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,934
<i>So we found a couple things.
What's the damage?</i>

141
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,339
<i>-How about 55?
-55.</i>

142
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:55,238
<i>My daughters cleaned me out.
I have $48.</i>

143
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,815
<i>-We'll put something back.
-Oh, no.</i>

144
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,814
<i>-You sure?
-Yeah.</i>

145
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,359
<i>-Thank you.
-Thank you.</i>

146
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:05,017
<i>You're clearing out.
You moving or something?</i>

147
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:08,642
<i>-No. Some of bills came up.
-Oh.</i>

148
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:48,036
<i>No! No!</i>

149
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:03,671
<i>Look at these carvings.
They're so pretty.</i>

150
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,586
<i>These directions are ridiculous.</i>

151
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,378
<i>Em, do me a favour and hand
me the screwdriver, please?</i>

152
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,854
<i>But Daddy,
you said you'd get this open.</i>

153
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,595
<i>Well, that's weird.
There aren't any seams.</i>

154
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,910
<i>What does that mean?</i>

155
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:26,361
<i>It means whoever made this
didn't want anybody to open it...</i>

156
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:29,359
<i>...or they didn't want
anybody to open it easily.</i>

157
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,662
<i>You hear that?
There's something in there.</i>

158
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:39,351
<i>So somebody had to open it,
once upon a time.</i>

159
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,619
<i>That is absolutely correct.</i>

160
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:46,815
<i>-Daddy, no.
-I have to take it.</i>

161
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,734
<i>-Trevor. Sorry, I missed your calls.
-Daddy.</i>

162
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:50,630
<i>How's my old friend doing?</i>

163
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:51,591
<i>Good.</i>

164
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,318
<i>Daddy--</i>

165
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,230
<i>You run a good program up there.</i>

166
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,307
<i>You have two conference titles.</i>

167
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:58,194
<i>You calling just to chat?</i>

168
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,017
<i>Our board is taking note.</i>

169
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:04,158
<i>Thought it was time you come to
North Carolina, discuss your future.</i>

170
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,085
<i>What are we talking about here?</i>

171
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,406
<i>Talking about you moving
up to Division One.</i>

172
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,962
<i>Does Coach Hill know you doing this?</i>

173
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,128
<i>He's retiring.</i>

174
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,443
<i>He told me to contact you.</i>

175
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:18,375
<i>Said the school needs one
of their own to come take the reins.</i>

176
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:22,205
<i>What can I say?
Hell, yes, I'm interested.</i>

177
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,032
<i>-What's going on?
-I don't know. It wasn't me.</i>

178
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:44,049
<i>-Dad!
-Hannah! What is it?</i>

179
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,468
<i>It was on my face! Get it off!</i>

180
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,061
<i>-What are you talking about?
-It's under the covers!</i>

181
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,082
<i>Dad!</i>

182
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,273
<i>-You did that on my bed.
-You told me to kill it.</i>

183
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,240
<i>I told you to get it out.</i>

184
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,206
<i>God, Dad.</i>

185
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,294
<i>She told me to kill it.</i>

186
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,552
<i>It's a moth!</i>

187
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:23,508
<i>Make some noise for the
most dazzling divas of dance...</i>

188
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,798
<i>...who always bring it fierce...</i>

189
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,611
<i>...the Silver stars!</i>

190
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,573
<i>Make me a home,
on my own, better make that bedrock</i>

191
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,338
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

192
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,495
<i>-I feel funny.
-What?</i>

193
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:44,363
<i>-I feel funny.
-What do you mean?</i>

194
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,871
<i>I don't feel like me.</i>

195
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,736
<i>I know this stuff
with Mom and Dad sucks...</i>

196
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,575
<i>...but we're just the kids,
and they're the adults...</i>

197
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,716
<i>...and we have to go
along with their mistakes.</i>

198
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:02,757
<i>But you'll feel better if
you just stopped giving a shit.</i>

199
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:19,616
<i>Hi! Hey! Oh...</i>

200
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:20,868
<i>Oh, hi, Mommy.</i>

201
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,834
<i>-I missed you guys.
-I missed you too.</i>

202
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,008
<i>How was the weekend?</i>

203
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,826
<i>It was good. We had pizza.</i>

204
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:30,178
<i>Wow, yes,
the new house has a pizza tree.</i>

205
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,854
<i>-Is Jen's mom coming?
-Oh, yeah.</i>

206
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,053
<i>Your outfit is on your bed...</i>

207
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:37,660
<i>...and take one of your
allergy pills just in case.</i>

208
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,594
<i>If one of your players had food allergies...</i>

209
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:44,358
<i>...you'd write the cafeteria
ladies with menu demands.</i>

210
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,454
<i>Cut me some slack.</i>

211
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,214
<i>I was going get the boxes.</i>

212
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,450
<i>-Okay.
-Okay.</i>

213
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,441
<i>What's with this guy?
Is he moving in or what?</i>

214
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:05,040
<i>No. No, we're just dating.</i>

215
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,168
<i>You're just dating?</i>

216
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,474
<i>He's awfully comfortable
in the kitchen.</i>

217
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,815
<i>Back off, Clyde.</i>

218
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:14,496
<i>-In his antiseptic socks.
-At least he's present.</i>

219
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:15,798
<i>Excuse me?</i>

220
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,400
<i>Presence, attendance...</i>

221
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,308
<i>...being in the moment
as opposed to absent.</i>

222
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,568
<i>-Like you.
-I know what it means.</i>

223
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,961
<i>-Don't forget your stuff.
-Fine.</i>

224
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,118
<i>Hello?</i>

225
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,163
<i>Clyde, it's Trevor.</i>

226
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:04,799
<i>Hey.</i>

227
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,886
<i>Got your flight lined up.</i>

228
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:09,358
<i>I'll have the university
pick you up when you land.</i>

229
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,204
<i>-Quite the welcome.
-You'll love it.</i>

230
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:14,190
<i>Okay. Thank you for calling.</i>

231
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:15,629
<i>Keep me informed. Alright, bye.</i>

232
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,165
<i>So she's in the middle row.</i>

233
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,334
<i>-Hannah's dance is next week.
-Oh!</i>

234
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,723
<i>It's her first time with a real audience.</i>

235
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,848
<i>-That's cool.
-Are you going to make it?</i>

236
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,412
<i>Heck, yes, I'm coming.</i>

237
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:29,175
<i>Mom will be there,
so don't feel obligated.</i>

238
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,085
<i>Are you kidding?
I'll be in the front row.</i>

239
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>What's in your mouth?</i>

240
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,777
<i>Hannah, I told you,
your teeth were perfect.</i>

241
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:41,626
<i>No, you said it was my decision,
and I don't want to be disfigured.</i>

242
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:44,234
<i>Disfigured?
Who said you were disfigured?</i>

243
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,934
<i>I did. I'm totally disfigured.</i>

244
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,912
<i>You are perfect.</i>

245
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,725
<i>Dad?</i>

246
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,774
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

247
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:08,173
<i>Go back outside.</i>

248
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:09,879
<i>-Is someone in the house?
-Go</i>

249
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,799
<i>Who's there?</i>

250
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:46,326
<i>Dad?</i>

251
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,025
<i>It's okay, you guys.
I think we have a raccoon.</i>

252
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,649
<i>Emily.</i>

253
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,377
<i>Emily.</i>

254
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,151
<i>Emily.</i>

255
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:26,418
<i>Emily.</i>

256
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:38,221
<i>Em, breakfast is ready!</i>

257
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,393
<i>Ace!</i>

258
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:48,573
<i>Can't you hear me yelling for you?
Breakfast is ready.</i>

259
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,145
<i>Em.</i>

260
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:04,644
<i>What's wrong, Daddy?</i>

261
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,612
<i>First, the announcer comes out and
announces us.</i>

262
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:14,430
<i>He has the most obnoxious voice.
I don't know why I can't do it.</i>

263
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,711
<i>And he goes like, "Make some noise...</i>

264
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:21,499
<i>"...for the most dazzling divas of
dance, who always keep it fierce...</i>

265
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,710
<i>...the Silver stars!"</i>

266
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:26,033
<i>We all wear a ponytail
to look the same...</i>

267
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,228
<i>...because we're the
chorus with the can-can.</i>

268
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:32,585
<i>-Jen cut her hair. She needs extensions.
-Em, slow down.</i>

269
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,950
<i>They use real Indian and Asian hair.</i>

270
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:38,892
<i>-I personally think it's gross.
-Em--</i>

271
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:41,765
<i>They sweep it into
bins and weigh it...</i>

272
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:45,073
<i>...then they take it to
a place where they make wigs...</i>

273
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,761
<i>Em, slow down!</i>

274
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,628
<i>I'm sorry, Daddy! I'm sorry, Daddy!</i>

275
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,019
<i>-I'm really sorry!
-Go to your room.</i>

276
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,002
<i>Hannah, what happened?</i>

277
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:21,306
<i>In there!</i>

278
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:23,710
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

279
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,825
<i>My god.</i>

280
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,521
<i>Em? Stay there, Em.</i>

281
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,408
<i>Close the door. Close it!</i>

282
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:26,012
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

283
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,041
<i>What happened?</i>

284
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,213
<i>Creepy.</i>

285
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:39,279
<i>I had no idea moths were
attracted to pizza and soda.</i>

286
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,112
<i>The pest control
guy can take care of it.</i>

287
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:45,051
<i>I'm still getting your email on my computer.</i>

288
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:49,224
<i>-Want me to take care of it?
-Yes, please.</i>

289
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:59,822
<i>-How was Wagner?
-It was good. Interesting.</i>

290
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:02,556
<i>"Interesting."</i>

291
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:06,081
<i>"Interesting" is code
for you fell asleep.</i>

292
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,210
<i>-No, I didn't.
-You totally felt asleep.</i>

293
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,805
<i>I didn't fall asleep.</i>

294
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:14,043
<i>Okay, I don't know what this file is.</i>

295
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:17,103
<i>What am I doing?</i>

296
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,317
<i>Don't you remember that?</i>

297
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:22,378
<i>That was the weekend the
kids were in camp, remember?</i>

298
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,025
<i>-Good morning.
-Good morning.</i>

299
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:27,676
<i>-Did you sleep okay?
-I did. It's a little hot in here.</i>

300
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:30,560
<i>Oh, I do remember.</i>

301
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:33,040
<i>No.</i>

302
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,157
<i>What are you doing?</i>

303
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:38,521
<i>That was a weekend.</i>

304
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:40,403
<i>That was a weekend.</i>

305
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:42,642
<i>Oh, Lord.</i>

306
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:48,038
<i>-Nice legs, I'll give you that.
-Oh, God.</i>

307
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:53,294
<i>Remember when--</i>

308
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:55,999
<i>-What?
-Nothing. Never mind.</i>

309
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:01,204
<i>Okay.</i>

310
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,604
<i>All right, there you go.</i>

311
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:07,058
<i>I am successfully deleted from your computer.</i>

312
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:09,362
<i>Thank you.</i>

313
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:15,083
<i>I've been meaning to ask you.</i>

314
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:19,596
<i>Have you noticed anything
odd going on with Emily?</i>

315
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,195
<i>Like what?</i>

316
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,544
<i>I don't know.</i>

317
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:25,888
<i>She has these moments
where she just checks out.</i>

318
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:30,204
<i>We've disrupted their whole lives.</i>

319
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:34,081
<i>It will be a while before
anything's normal again, right?</i>

320
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,151
<i>Yeah.</i>

321
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,990
<i>-Okay. I'll see you soon.
-Okay.</i>

322
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,233
<i>Thank you.</i>

323
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,654
<i>Where's the communication?
I don't hear anything out here.</i>

324
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:01,501
<i>You going to pass it?</i>

325
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:05,097
<i>No, you'll shoot it.</i>

326
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:06,889
<i>20 minutes on the clock.</i>

327
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,329
<i>We're running a full half.</i>

328
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,556
<i>Hustle or we're staying
and running lines.</i>

329
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:13,898
<i>Let's go.
Let's move.</i>

330
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:16,143
<i>Didn't you have to go at 5:00?</i>

331
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,699
<i>-What time is it?
-Past that.</i>

332
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:24,767
<i>Make some noise for the
most dazzling divas of dance...</i>

333
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:27,787
<i>...who always bring it fierce--</i>

334
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:30,943
<i>The Silver Stars!</i>

335
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:48,362
<i>Hannah, I'm so sorry
I missed your performance.</i>

336
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:53,631
<i>I screwed up. I promise,
I'm going to make it up to you.</i>

337
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:55,623
<i>She's mad at you.</i>

338
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,433
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

339
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,143
<i>Is my box all right?</i>

340
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,432
<i>It's fine.</i>

341
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,018
<i>I don't want you going near it.</i>

342
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:09,622
<i>Okay.</i>

343
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,877
<i>Because I am the only one
who can touch it.</i>

344
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,480
<i>Em, what's the deal with the box?</i>

345
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,757
<i>Just don't touch it, okay?</i>

346
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,765
<i>Okay. I won't.</i>

347
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,425
<i>-Goodnight, Daddy.
-Goodnight, baby girl.</i>

348
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,534
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

349
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:21,587
<i>What's in this?</i>

350
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,368
<i>Give it back!</i>

351
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,647
<i>Give it back to me!
Give it back to me!</i>

352
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:31,979
<i>Give it back to me!</i>

353
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:33,696
<i>No!</i>

354
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:45,911
<i>Emily has displayed some
unusual behaviour the past few weeks.</i>

355
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,806
<i>She is becoming distant
from her friends...</i>

356
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:51,249
<i>...not doing her assignments.</i>

357
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,322
<i>She has lost interest in things
that were once so important to her.</i>

358
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:58,456
<i>Em's been going through a lot lately.</i>

359
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:02,568
<i>-You moved recently.
-Yeah, I moved.</i>

360
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:05,659
<i>Stephanie has the girls at...</i>

361
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,406
<i>...the same house they
grew up in most of the time.</i>

362
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,109
<i>How's your new home?</i>

363
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,161
<i>Things are fine.
Fine, given the circumstances.</i>

364
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:15,151
<i>Circumstances?</i>

365
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:19,422
<i>We're divorced. That's always
tough on the kids, isn't it?</i>

366
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:24,289
<i>I think it would benefit Emily to
talk to someone about her feelings.</i>

367
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,751
<i>Feelings?</i>

368
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:32,100
<i>I talk to her about her feelings
all the time. About everything.</i>

369
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:35,306
<i>Still, she seems
extremely frustrated.</i>

370
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:38,439
<i>She scared everybody with that box.</i>

371
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,310
<i>A little time away from it will do her good.</i>

372
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:44,756
<i>That just doesn't
sound like Emily at all.</i>

373
00:34:44,757 --> 00:34:46,725
<i>She's never been in a fight. Ever!</i>

374
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,630
<i>This wasn't just a fight.</i>

375
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:50,966
<i>This was violent.</i>

376
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:56,076
<i>We've been separated
for a year with no problems.</i>

377
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:58,651
<i>This behaviour,
something else is going on here.</i>

378
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:00,157
<i>Yeah, maybe she's insecure.</i>

379
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,213
<i>Maybe she's afraid you won't be there for.</i>

380
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:07,736
<i>Still getting your email. It's your
flight details to North Carolina.</i>

381
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:11,399
<i>-I was going to tell you.
-When? After you took the job?</i>

382
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,076
<i>Its just to sit down and talk.</i>

383
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:16,333
<i>If they offer it,
you going to take it?</i>

384
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:20,339
<i>-Of course you are.
-Wait.</i>

385
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,950
<i>Anything to be a big shot again.</i>

386
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:24,754
<i>While your daughter falls apart.</i>

387
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,615
<i>That has nothing to do with this.</i>

388
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:30,327
<i>Stay oblivious. It seems to
be working well for you.</i>

389
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,308
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

390
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,005
<i>You have to be kidding me.</i>

391
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,308
<i>Hey! Stay away from my kid's teeth.</i>

392
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:37,853
<i>So, Em, do you understand
why school was cancelled today?</i>

393
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:41,040
<i>Because Miss Shandy's dead.</i>

394
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,789
<i>That's right. She was in
a horrible accident last night.</i>

395
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,527
<i>Can you get my box for me?
It's still in the classroom.</i>

396
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:01,175
<i>Let's talk about
this for a second, okay?</i>

397
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,732
<i>Why is the box so important to you?</i>

398
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:09,391
<i>Don't know. Just is.</i>

399
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:12,513
<i>Okay.</i>

400
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:16,737
<i>You know, Emily...</i>

401
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:22,503
<i>...I noticed sometimes
you talk to it.</i>

402
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:24,125
<i>I do not talk to the box.</i>

403
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,844
<i>I talk to my friend.</i>

404
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,993
<i>-Your friend?
-What?</i>

405
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:32,699
<i>-You said you talk to your friend.
-Mm-hmm.</i>

406
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,627
<i>The one who lives in the box.</i>

407
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,673
<i>Your friend lives inside the box?</i>

408
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:40,054
<i>-What?
-He lives in there?</i>

409
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,801
<i>It's a she. A woman.</i>

410
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:51,246
<i>What exactly does she say to you, Emily?</i>

411
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,490
<i>That I'm special.</i>

412
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,198
<i>Well, you know, you are very special.</i>

413
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,980
<i>I'd sure like to meet her.</i>

414
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:05,904
<i>Not possible. No one can see her.</i>

415
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,968
<i>Not even me.</i>

416
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,282
<i>Can I have some more?</i>

417
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:17,875
<i>She's still hungry.</i>

418
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,953
<i>Where's my box?</i>

419
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,567
<i>I got rid of it, Em.</i>

420
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,314
<i>Tell me where it is.</i>

421
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:12,099
<i>It's not here.</i>

422
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:16,076
<i>Then go get it.</i>

423
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:17,981
<i>We're done with the box, Emily.</i>

424
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:23,278
<i>-I'm calling Mom.
-And tell her what?</i>

425
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:25,833
<i>-To pick me up.
-That's not happening.</i>

426
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:28,839
<i>And if you keep talking to me like this,
you're grounded for the rest of the weekend.</i>

427
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,818
<i>I hate you.</i>

428
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,663
<i>Go to your room. That's it.</i>

429
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:38,803
<i>- Go to your room.
- I don't love you.</i>

430
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:42,533
<i>-Emily...
-And Mommy doesn't love you.</i>

431
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:46,603
<i>-You think you know everything,
but you don't. -Emily, knock it off.</i>

432
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:47,894
<i>Stop it right now.</i>

433
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:49,503
<i>Mommy loves Brett now.</i>

434
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:51,290
<i>He makes her happy.</i>

435
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:57,192
<i>He does nice things for her!
Something you never did.</i>

436
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,710
<i>Ow! Daddy!
What are you doing to me. Daddy?</i>

437
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,601
<i>What are you...? Emily!</i>

438
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,718
<i>What are you doing to me, Daddy?</i>

439
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,111
<i>-What are you doing, Dad?
-I'm not doing anything!</i>

440
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:16,971
<i>-Did you hit her?
-No, I didn't hit her!</i>

441
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:18,773
<i>Emily!</i>

442
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,455
<i>Emily!</i>

443
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,101
<i>Em!</i>

444
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:48,916
<i>Em!</i>

445
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:51,273
<i>Em!</i>

446
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,298
<i>Are you my friend from the box?</i>

447
00:42:59,604 --> 00:43:03,862
<i>No. No.</i>

448
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:12,722
<i>Because my dad doesn't...
my dad doesn't like me anymore.</i>

449
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,618
<i>No.</i>

450
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:19,731
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

451
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:23,993
<i>No!</i>

452
00:43:25,114 --> 00:43:28,555
<i>No! No!</i>

453
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:42,432
<i>Em!</i>

454
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,022
<i>Right.</i>

455
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:32,156
<i>No, I got to go.</i>

456
00:44:32,157 --> 00:44:37,075
<i>The judge reviewed everything and is
granting the interim temporary order.</i>

457
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:39,717
<i>So I can't see my kids?</i>

458
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:43,521
<i>Based on Mrs. Brenek's report
about the bruise marks...</i>

459
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:46,307
<i>This is ridiculous.
You know I would never hit her.</i>

460
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,873
<i>A full hearing will be scheduled.</i>

461
00:44:48,874 --> 00:44:49,742
<i>Thank you.</i>

462
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,484
<i>-Wait, wait. Stephanie.
-Mr. Brenek!</i>

463
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:55,023
<i>Can we talk? Just the two of us?
We can work this out, Stephanie.</i>

464
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,030
<i>Mr. Brenek!
You can state your case--</i>

465
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,111
<i>I'm not talking to you!
I'm talking to my wife!</i>

466
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:01,860
<i>-Stephen--
-Don't touch me!</i>

467
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,169
<i>What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?</i>

468
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:11,333
<i>You destroyed us,
but I won't let you hurt the children.</i>

469
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:15,777
<i>Just move.</i>

470
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:18,308
<i>Just move to North Carolina.</i>

471
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,081
<i>I don't want to see you again.</i>

472
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:34,538
<i>He's clearly unstable.
He's angry and he's confused.</i>

473
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,144
<i>He's taking this divorce
out on everyone around him.</i>

474
00:45:37,145 --> 00:45:39,916
<i>It's why Em's has such a hard time.</i>

475
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,994
<i>I brought some DVDs over.</i>

476
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:44,463
<i>I thought we'd all
have a movie night.</i>

477
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:46,832
<i>That's a great idea.</i>

478
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,952
<i>Watch something funny.
Lighten the mood.</i>

479
00:45:51,307 --> 00:45:52,374
<i>Okay.</i>

480
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:01,527
<i>That's your second glass.
Save some for dinner?</i>

481
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:25,732
<i>Hey!</i>

482
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,484
<i>What you got there?</i>

483
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,318
<i>What's in your hand?
Come on.</i>

484
00:46:51,595 --> 00:46:53,404
<i>Can I see it?</i>

485
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,602
<i>Honey, it's okay. Let me see it.</i>

486
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:04,358
<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

487
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:09,889
<i>Where'd you get this, Em?</i>

488
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:20,780
<i>It's deliberate...</i>

489
00:47:32,198 --> 00:47:33,002
<i>Em?</i>

490
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:37,553
<i>Em?</i>

491
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:46,298
<i>I think you should leave.</i>

492
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:49,006
<i>I think you should leave now.</i>

493
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:50,982
<i>I don't like you!</i>

494
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:55,026
<i>You'll have to get used to that.</i>

495
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:07,929
<i>Coach, you looking for the bathroom?</i>

496
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:11,483
<i>What brings you to my class?</i>

497
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:15,555
<i>Quite a find, Clyde.</i>

498
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:18,885
<i>That's just it.
I have no idea what I've got here.</i>

499
00:48:18,886 --> 00:48:23,113
<i>From the woodwork, I'd say
it was from Poland, 1920s, '30s.</i>

500
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:25,289
<i>Probably from a Jewish village...</i>

501
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:30,066
<i>...indicated by these
Hebrew inscriptions.</i>

502
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:36,056
<i>I think it says, "Debunk".</i>

503
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:39,616
<i>It's the Hebrew word
for "dislocated spirit."</i>

504
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,259
<i>It's a debunk box.</i>

505
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,120
<i>So was it used for
something religious?</i>

506
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,650
<i>The more traditional
branches of Judaism,</i>

507
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:50,243
<i>especially in the Hasidic sects...</i>

508
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:55,558
<i>...believe in various spirits,
both benevolent and, um...</i>

509
00:48:57,112 --> 00:49:01,816
<i>-Benevolent and--
-Evil. Like demons.</i>

510
00:49:02,836 --> 00:49:04,896
<i>A debunk box was
made with the belief...</i>

511
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:09,159
<i>...that the evil itself
could somehow be contained.</i>

512
00:49:10,287 --> 00:49:11,337
<i>Think of it.</i>

513
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:16,409
<i>If you believed such a thing,
that you could trap a demon.</i>

514
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:23,497
<i>And now,
it's in your hands, Coach Brenek.</i>

515
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:26,234
<i>Carrying around this curse.</i>

516
00:49:26,235 --> 00:49:29,904
<i>Whoo... Very brave man.</i>

517
00:49:31,112 --> 00:49:35,718
<i>Whoever made this box certainly
had intense convictions.</i>

518
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,602
<i>It's why they concealed
this lock and carved these words.</i>

519
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:43,332
<i>Basically what they're saying is...</i>

520
00:49:45,406 --> 00:49:48,809
<i>"Warning. Deadly."</i>

521
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,657
<i>"Do not open."</i>

522
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:54,856
<i>So, don't open it.</i>

523
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,004
<i>-What are you doing here?
-Where's your sister?</i>

524
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:02,375
<i>Mom would freak if she knew.</i>

525
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:04,607
<i>I'm not screwing around.
I need to see Emily.</i>

526
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:06,926
<i>She decided to stay home.
She's not feeling very well.</i>

527
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:08,566
<i>Dad!</i>

528
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:24,512
<i>Em.</i>

529
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:37,943
<i>"Whoever sits in the
refuge of the most high...</i>

530
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:42,102
<i>"...he shall dwell in
the shade of the Almighty.</i>

531
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:44,147
<i>"I will say of Hashem...</i>

532
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:48,708
<i>"...He is my refuge,
my fortress, my God.</i>

533
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:51,978
<i>"I will trust in Him.</i>

534
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:55,677
<i>"For He will deliver
you from the ensnaring trap...</i>

535
00:51:55,678 --> 00:51:57,920
<i>...from devastating pestilence..."</i>

536
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:09,192
<i>"With his pinion He will cover you,</i>

537
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,569
<i>and beneath His wings
you will be protected.</i>

538
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,534
<i>"His truth is shield...</i>

539
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:22,749
<i>"His truth is shield and armour.</i>

540
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:26,817
<i>You shall not fear
the terror of night, nor--"</i>

541
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:37,977
<i>Who are you?</i>

542
00:52:40,362 --> 00:52:43,600
<i>What do you want with
my little girl?</i>

543
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,544
<i>You tell me!</i>

544
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,456
<i>What do you want?</i>

545
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:52,225
<i>You tell me!</i>

546
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:54,153
<i>Clyde!</i>

547
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:56,685
<i>What are you doing here? Get out!</i>

548
00:52:56,686 --> 00:53:00,322
<i>Get out of the house!
I'll call the police. Get out!</i>

549
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,973
<i>Babylon your throne</i>

550
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:59,763
<i>Down, down, down</i>

551
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:05,139
<i>Babylon your throne down</i>

552
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:11,613
<i>One bright morning
when my work is over</i>

553
00:54:11,613 --> 00:54:14,492
<i>I'm going to fly--</i>

554
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:15,999
<i>Excuse me.</i>

555
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,487
<i>Sorry.</i>

556
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,589
<i>I get kind of lost when I'm listening.</i>

557
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,033
<i>My name is Clyde Brenek.
I'm looking for Tzadok Shapir.</i>

558
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:24,530
<i>Yeah, that's me.</i>

559
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:27,477
<i>-We talked on the phone.
-Thanks for meeting me.</i>

560
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:30,900
<i>Is that it?</i>

561
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:33,711
<i>Yeah.</i>

562
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:39,811
<i>All right. I'll take you
to see my father the Rebbe Shapir...</i>

563
00:54:39,812 --> 00:54:43,027
<i>...but I must tell you, he's traditional.</i>

564
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:45,030
<i>Okay.</i>

565
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,243
<i>Alright.
Everyone's waiting in the shul.</i>

566
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,680
<i>My father asks if you could show
what's in the bag.</i>

567
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:44,597
<i>Tzadok Shapir wants to know where you got it.</i>

568
00:55:44,598 --> 00:55:46,902
<i>I bought it at a yard sale.</i>

569
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:49,363
<i>Did you open it?</i>

570
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:55,926
<i>Tell us, did you open the box?</i>

571
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,133
<i>My daughter...</i>

572
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:00,961
<i>My daughter opened it.</i>

573
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:09,376
<i>What does this thing
want with my daughter?</i>

574
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:16,354
<i>The debunk looks for innocence.
A pure soul.</i>

575
00:56:16,355 --> 00:56:20,555
<i>It will move back
and forth from the box...</i>

576
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:23,261
<i>...searching for a proper host.</i>

577
00:56:23,262 --> 00:56:27,572
<i>The host begins to hear voices...
experience visions.</i>

578
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:30,667
<i>All of this is the
deception of the spirit...</i>

579
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:34,069
<i>...to protect the host
and drive others away.</i>

580
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,894
<i>The final stage is when the
debunk attaches to the host....</i>

581
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,327
<i>...the two becoming one.</i>

582
00:56:41,328 --> 00:56:45,849
<i>It will feed and take
until there is nothing left.</i>

583
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,743
<i>It wants only one thing--
that which it does not have.</i>

584
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,447
<i>Leiben.</i>

585
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:54,211
<i>Life.</i>

586
00:57:08,536 --> 00:57:10,996
<i>How do I stop it?</i>

587
00:57:12,317 --> 00:57:13,898
<i>The only way to stop the debunk...</i>

588
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:19,152
<i>...is by commanding it
back into the box by its name.</i>

589
00:57:19,153 --> 00:57:20,535
<i>I don't have its name.</i>

590
00:57:21,764 --> 00:57:25,424
<i>This is what I have.
I need your help.</i>

591
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:32,624
<i>I saw this ceremony, an exorcism.</i>

592
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,184
<i>It is too great of a risk.</i>

593
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:39,292
<i>The debunk could come upon anyone
attempting to perform the ceremony.</i>

594
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,506
<i>No.</i>

595
00:57:42,107 --> 00:57:44,751
<i>No, wait. Wait, please.</i>

596
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:50,028
<i>Someone here has to help me.</i>

597
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:52,797
<i>It's not my little girl anymore.</i>

598
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,508
<i>When I look at her,
it's this thing looking back at me.</i>

599
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:04,173
<i>But my little girl,
Emily, she's in there, right?</i>

600
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:07,710
<i>Please tell me she's in there.</i>

601
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:10,497
<i>You have to help me.</i>

602
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:30,579
<i>This must be left to the will of God.</i>

603
00:58:33,156 --> 00:58:36,393
<i>The will of God?</i>

604
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:45,803
<i>If this were your child, would
you leave it to the will of God?</i>

605
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,002
<i>Mr. Brenek?</i>

606
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,423
<i>I'm coming with you.</i>

607
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:12,771
<i>Why?</i>

608
00:59:12,772 --> 00:59:16,932
<i>Pikuach nefesh. A permitted
violation of a Shabbat law.</i>

609
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:21,866
<i>A human life is in danger. I am not
only allowed, but required to act.</i>

610
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,025
<i>Let's go.</i>

611
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:49,807
<i>Em...</i>

612
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:54,700
<i>What are you doing?</i>

613
01:00:55,908 --> 01:00:57,132
<i>Emma...</i>

614
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:02,651
<i>Give me that, sweetie.</i>

615
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,217
<i>-Emily, what are you doing?
-Em's not here!</i>

616
01:01:14,218 --> 01:01:17,986
<i>It's okay, baby.
Come here. Come here.</i>

617
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:22,406
<i>You just stop this right now.
Come here. Come to Mommy.</i>

618
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:23,445
<i>No!</i>

619
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:26,575
<i>I'm not playing games now, Emily.</i>

620
01:01:26,576 --> 01:01:31,900
<i>I said, Em's not here!</i>

621
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:35,809
<i>Emily... come here, honey.</i>

622
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:50,435
<i>Em, where are you?</i>

623
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:56,834
<i>Emily, come here, baby.</i>

624
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,755
<i>Come here.</i>

625
01:02:15,071 --> 01:02:18,696
<i>Em, where are you?</i>

626
01:02:21,925 --> 01:02:22,872
<i>Em?</i>

627
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:34,322
<i>Emily?</i>

628
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:39,959
<i>Where are you?</i>

629
01:02:47,876 --> 01:02:51,097
<i>Mom, who am I?</i>

630
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,136
<i>Oh, baby...</i>

631
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,173
<i>Who am I, Mommy?</i>

632
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,112
<i>Her face...</i>

633
01:03:08,113 --> 01:03:11,354
<i>...you should have seen it.</i>

634
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,918
<i>I was actually scared.</i>

635
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:20,237
<i>I've never seen anything like that.</i>

636
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:26,175
<i>With everything going on,
we need to have her see someone.</i>

637
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,437
<i>I called a friend of mine.</i>

638
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,169
<i>She's a mental health specialist.
She works with kids all the time.</i>

639
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,090
<i>She says she can see Em tomorrow morning.</i>

640
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:38,076
<i>Spend a couple days,
give her a full evaluation.</i>

641
01:03:38,077 --> 01:03:39,447
<i>Okay.</i>

642
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,567
<i>You could tell Em that we're just
going away for the weekend.</i>

643
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:09,082
<i>Okay, everybody, let's go!</i>

644
01:04:19,946 --> 01:04:21,568
<i>Emily?</i>

645
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:22,591
<i>Brett?</i>

646
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:30,590
<i>You okay?</i>

647
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,032
<i>Em?</i>

648
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,557
<i>Em?</i>

649
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,848
<i>-Hannah!
-What's going on?</i>

650
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,085
<i>Call 911!</i>

651
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:25,878
<i>What's wrong with her, Mom?</i>

652
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,352
<i>There must be a name.</i>

653
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:43,563
<i>I searched every inch of that box.</i>

654
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:49,378
<i>The carvings, a prayer...</i>

655
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,182
<i>...the tokens placed inside...</i>

656
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:52,661
<i>...but why there is mirror?</i>

657
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:57,716
<i>If the spirit was contained,
it would have to look upon itself...</i>

658
01:05:57,717 --> 01:06:01,019
<i>...to be forever reminded
it turned away from God.</i>

659
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:03,193
<i>Jesus.</i>

660
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:14,213
<i>"Abyzou."</i>

661
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:16,282
<i>"Abyzou.</i>

662
01:06:16,282 --> 01:06:19,774
<i>Taker of children."</i>

663
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:26,322
<i>Hurry.</i>

664
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:36,049
<i>I'd like to schedule
an MRI right away.</i>

665
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:36,891
<i>Okay.</i>

666
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,672
<i>Emily, we're going to
slide you into this machine.</i>

667
01:06:40,673 --> 01:06:45,441
<i>Think of it as a big camera.
Let's us take a look inside.</i>

668
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:47,121
<i>-Am I okay?
-Yeah, baby.</i>

669
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:50,083
<i>Everything's going to be all right.
Don't be afraid. Okay?</i>

670
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:53,035
<i>We'll be in the other room. Okay?</i>

671
01:06:53,036 --> 01:06:57,029
<i>You'll hear noises, Emily.
It's nothing to be scared of.</i>

672
01:06:58,239 --> 01:06:59,404
<i>I love you.</i>

673
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:01,817
<i>I need you to stay very very still.</i>

674
01:07:10,848 --> 01:07:13,160
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

675
01:07:26,312 --> 01:07:27,521
<i>Can I close my eyes?</i>

676
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:28,895
<i>Of course.</i>

677
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:30,631
<i>We're going to start taking pictures now.</i>

678
01:07:37,669 --> 01:07:40,755
<i>Looking good. Good tissue.</i>

679
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,679
<i>You're doing great, Emily.</i>

680
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:20,772
<i>What's happening?
Is she all right in there by herself?</i>

681
01:08:20,773 --> 01:08:23,027
<i>She's fine.
Get somebody else up here.</i>

682
01:08:23,028 --> 01:08:24,400
<i>What's going on?</i>

683
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:27,263
<i>This happens occasionally.</i>

684
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:44,060
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

685
01:08:47,614 --> 01:08:49,285
<i>There is something else in there with her!</i>

686
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:17,794
<i>Hey.</i>

687
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:20,061
<i>Hi.</i>

688
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,374
<i>-Dad, I'm so sorry.
-No.</i>

689
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:40,142
<i>I saw... something...</i>

690
01:09:44,312 --> 01:09:46,975
<i>I saw something in her.</i>

691
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:50,574
<i>The doctors,
they can't help us, can they?</i>

692
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:54,359
<i>Just, I need you to trust me, okay?</i>

693
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,470
<i>Can you get her out?</i>

694
01:09:57,471 --> 01:10:00,292
<i>No. We're going to have to do it here.</i>

695
01:10:00,293 --> 01:10:01,190
<i>Here?</i>

696
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:03,663
<i>Great.</i>

697
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:10,220
<i>I hate hospitals. People die here.</i>

698
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:17,208
<i>Hey.</i>

699
01:10:18,676 --> 01:10:22,365
<i>This is Tzadok.
Tzadok, this is my family.</i>

700
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:25,663
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

701
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,916
<i>-Can you help us?
-Of course.</i>

702
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,407
<i>Do I look like a doctor?</i>

703
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:46,221
<i>It doesn't want me here.
We need a private place.</i>

704
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:09,927
<i>Thank you.</i>

705
01:11:16,632 --> 01:11:19,752
<i>There's a therapy room down there.
My players use it sometimes.</i>

706
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:21,744
<i>No one uses it after 6:00.</i>

707
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:37,168
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

708
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:39,139
<i>-Light these candles.
-How many?</i>

709
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,941
<i>Seven.</i>

710
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:51,516
<i>Put something from
your heart in the box.</i>

711
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:54,276
<i>This essence will bind the prayer.</i>

712
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:55,925
<i>This belonged to my grandfather.</i>

713
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:58,421
<i>The strength of my family is with us.</i>

714
01:11:58,422 --> 01:11:59,976
<i>Hannah? Honey?</i>

715
01:12:03,414 --> 01:12:04,171
<i>Stephanie.</i>

716
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:07,824
<i>Your wedding ring.</i>

717
01:12:08,466 --> 01:12:10,611
<i>Once we begin,
we must complete the ceremony.</i>

718
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,888
<i>The debunk will do
everything it can to stop us.</i>

719
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:17,177
<i>Even in the face of evil,
our faith must remain unwavering.</i>

720
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:19,074
<i>-Okay.
-Please, God.</i>

721
01:12:19,843 --> 01:12:22,653
<i>Oil of two olive trees.
Oil represents light.</i>

722
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:24,241
<i>Water represents darkness.</i>

723
01:12:24,242 --> 01:12:29,674
<i>May God separate between these two
as only light can dispel darkness.</i>

724
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,794
<i>"Nor the destruction
that ravages at noon.</i>

725
01:12:44,795 --> 01:12:46,693
<i>"Put Your hands on her.</i>

726
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:49,352
<i>"You need only look with Your eyes...</i>

727
01:12:49,353 --> 01:12:52,122
<i>...and the punishment
of the wicked illuminator."</i>

728
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:04,664
<i>Shut up!</i>

729
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:09,955
<i>You take me! Take me!</i>

730
01:13:12,033 --> 01:13:15,459
<i>Everybody, put your hands on her!</i>

731
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,964
<i>Cast all fear from your hearts!</i>

732
01:13:26,629 --> 01:13:28,321
<i>You die!</i>

733
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:34,345
<i>Emily!</i>

734
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:37,590
<i>Daddy!</i>

735
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:40,206
<i>You let me daughter go! Take me!</i>

736
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,805
<i>You take me instead!</i>

737
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:45,716
<i>No!</i>

738
01:13:48,943 --> 01:13:51,440
<i>That is no longer your daughter!</i>

739
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:09,999
<i>Em?</i>

740
01:14:23,336 --> 01:14:24,253
<i>Em?</i>

741
01:14:58,788 --> 01:15:00,954
<i>Daddy, you scared me.</i>

742
01:15:05,313 --> 01:15:07,831
<i>Daddy, you scared me.</i>

743
01:15:13,332 --> 01:15:15,754
<i>Daddy, you scared me.</i>

744
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:24,238
<i>Daddy, you scared me.</i>

745
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,251
<i>Daddy, you scare me.</i>

746
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:39,639
<i>Dad, you scare me.</i>

747
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:13,662
<i>Take me! You take me instead!</i>

748
01:16:15,545 --> 01:16:16,731
<i>Em!</i>

749
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:18,991
<i>Clyde?</i>

750
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:33,532
<i>Daddy?</i>

751
01:16:33,533 --> 01:16:35,604
<i>Em, is that you?</i>

752
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:43,266
<i>Clyde!</i>

753
01:16:58,211 --> 01:16:59,519
<i>Daddy?</i>

754
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,428
<i>Is it okay? Okay?</i>

755
01:17:05,428 --> 01:17:07,992
<i>-Em...
-Oh, thank god.</i>

756
01:17:07,993 --> 01:17:11,660
<i>All right.</i>

757
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:12,967
<i>This is all wrong.</i>

758
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:15,360
<i>Guys, this is not right.</i>

759
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:17,151
<i>Where is it?</i>

760
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:19,777
<i>Where's the Debunk?</i>

761
01:17:21,982 --> 01:17:24,107
<i>Abyzou.</i>

762
01:17:24,108 --> 01:17:27,933
<i>Abyzou. Abyzou.</i>

763
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,019
<i>Abyzou!</i>

764
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,614
<i>Abyzou!</i>

765
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:38,828
<i>Abyzou!</i>

766
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:47,541
<i>Abyzou!</i>

767
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:54,180
<i>Abyzou!</i>

768
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:58,133
<i>Abyzou!</i>

769
01:17:58,134 --> 01:18:02,814
<i>Abyzou!</i>

770
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:04,003
<i>Hannah!</i>

771
01:18:04,004 --> 01:18:08,593
<i>Abyzou!</i>

772
01:18:12,628 --> 01:18:15,921
<i>No! No!</i>

773
01:18:19,749 --> 01:18:24,779
<i>I say to you that He will
save you from the ensnaring trap!</i>

774
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:29,408
<i>He will instruct His angels in your
behalf to guard you in all your ways.</i>

775
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:38,267
<i>I say to you in the name of God,
leave this flesh!</i>

776
01:18:38,268 --> 01:18:41,701
<i>Abyzou!</i>

777
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:51,309
<i>He will save you from
the destruction and pestilence.</i>

778
01:18:59,005 --> 01:19:06,543
<i>Abyzou!</i>

779
01:19:10,406 --> 01:19:13,963
<i>You are cast away
from the eyes of God!</i>

780
01:19:13,963 --> 01:19:15,326
<i>Daddy!</i>

781
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:18,562
<i>Abyzou!</i>

782
01:20:06,989 --> 01:20:08,296
<i>Hannah?</i>

783
01:20:11,104 --> 01:20:12,847
<i>Daddy...</i>

784
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,142
<i>It's okay.</i>

785
01:20:58,890 --> 01:20:59,814
<i>Hi.</i>

786
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:47,465
<i>Oh, it's just a cough.</i>

787
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,069
<i>Tzadok, hey!
I'm calling to say thank you.</i>

788
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:05,497
<i>Clyde! I was going to call.
I need to get your car back to you.</i>

789
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:08,529
<i>You keep it.
I am not going to be going anywhere.</i>

790
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:10,516
<i>How's the family?</i>

791
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:13,339
<i>Perfect. More than perfect.</i>

792
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:16,673
<i>-So what are you going to do with it?
-I'm not sure.</i>

793
01:22:16,674 --> 01:22:19,907
<i>I'm going to speak with my father.
We'll find a safe place for it.</i>

794
01:22:19,908 --> 01:22:22,925
<i>Okay. Goodbye, Tzadok.</i>

795
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:24,506
<i>Goodbye, Clyde.</i>
