00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,679
DEANNA: Pete's a surgeon.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,901
RICK: He's beating his wife.

4
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:07,070
We have to stop it.

5
00:00:07,182 --> 00:00:08,149
PETE: Get away!

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,283
(screaming)

7
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,222
RICK: He killed Reg, we
didn't have a choice.

8
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:12,232
DEANNA: Rick?

9
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,233
Do it.

10
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:14,368
(gun shot)

11
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,060
RICK: What I'm proposing-
force 'em west, here.

12
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,100
They'll follow a path if
something's drawing 'em.

13
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:20,049
RICK: It's open!

14
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,317
We've gotta do this now!

15
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:24,186
RICK: Head back, tell
everyone what's happening.

16
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,556
GLENN: It's a horn or something, it's
pulling the back half off the road.

17
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,037
MICHONNE: It sounds
like it's coming from--

18
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,183
Home.

19
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,931
Woman: It says the
ignition switch fuse

20
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,766
is found at location number 27.

21
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,902
Man: All right, 27. I need
to know where that is.

22
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,370
(woman sighs)

23
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:43,473
Um, right here.

24
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,642
Man: Yeah, okay,
this one's blown.

25
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,043
What's this one, the red one?

26
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:51,247

27
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,016
Enid: Mom, Dad,
we got to go.

28
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,518
- Man: Come on, come on.
- Woman: We see them.

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
Just need to find a fuse
so we can start the car.

30
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,656
Almost got it, honey.
Location six.

31
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:02,025
That's turn signal lamps
and stop lamps.

32
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,860
Man: All right, we can
live without turn signals.

33
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,562

Celery soup.

00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,068
It's been here since the start.

50
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:49,887
- You're very brave.

51
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,956
Well, I'm hoping
the paprika will mask

Carol: <i>Well, I just figured since
we're running low on staples,</i>

57
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:04,535
I'd try to use a few things
nobody seems to want.

58
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,073
I used to make Ed these
spring cleaning casseroles

59
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,809
just to empty the pantry.

60
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,912
I made some miracles happen
with water chestnuts.

61
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:18,950
Talk about miracles, that
recipe for cola canned ham.

62
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,618
Mmm.

63
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,021
Ms. Peletier, you are
an honest to goodness hero.

00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,559

Erin:
<i>Something wrong, Shelly?</i>

00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:33,531
It's just those old noodles.

68
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,268
I mean, I tell you, if someone would
just find me one of those machines,

69
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,239
I swear we would all be eating
like we were on a tour of Tuscany.

70
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,343
You know, Shel,
I could teach you

71
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,979
how to make pasta
with your own two hands.

72
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,615
But you'd have to promise
not to smoke in the house.

73
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,483
It's just a disgusting habit.

74
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,819
And it kills you.

75
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,754
If you ask me,
there are too many things

76
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,689
trying to do that
already, right?

77
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,659
Right.

78
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,703
Your dad used to hit you and
then he got himself killed.

79
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,707
It happened.
Now it's done.

80
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,343
You live with it
or it eats you up.

81
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,379
Go home.

82
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,966
Ron.

83
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:50,374
Ron.

84
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:52,510
Can you come down here?

86
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,059
No.

87
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:10,728
- Ron.
- No, I don't want a haircut.

88
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:14,031
Look, I just gave myself one.

89
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,366
All right?
It's all set up.

90
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,235
Don't make me do it
again next week.

91
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,836
Take off your hat.

92
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,506
- This is bullshit.
- What did you just--

93
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:23,508
This is just you
trying to talk to me.

94
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,478
There are things
we need to talk about.

95
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,249
There are things
that you need to learn.

96
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:32,950
What, are you serious?

97
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,288
What is it? Do you--
do you blame me?

98
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,660
Huh? Do you actually blame me?

99
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,597
Raise your left arm
above your head.

100
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:52,103
You can't.
Tell me why.

101
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,704
No.

102
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,542
Your father was dangerous.

103
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:00,378
Rick is dangerous.

104
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,981
He doesn't have anything
to do with this.

105
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,516
What, is he your friend?

106
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,587
Yeah, he's my friend.

107
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,568
We got some panels to put up,

108
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,103
but we don't have to wait
to start growing things.

109
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,973
There will be some sore
backs and tired feet.

110
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,642
That's how you know you've
put in a hard day's work.

111
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:45,556
They found crates of these at a
nursery just a few miles out.

112
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,392
Tomatoes, carrots, you name it.

113
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,828
We can plant them right here.

114
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,465
Just need to finish
the expansion

115
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,535
and the wall needs to go up.

116
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:01,806
Reg wanted
this community to grow.

117
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,108
You did, too.

118
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,943
Has that changed?

119
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,050
Everyone that's here
is here because of you.

120
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,456
You need to show them
you're still here.

121
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,435
It hams my biscuits is all.

122
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,505
And going by cubic feet, the
biggest building in the expansion

123
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,474
and we're gonna
waste it on a church.

124
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,342
Take out the benches,
that could be a lab,

125
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,178
a machine shop, very least
a sweet-ass game room.

00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,583
Thumpers just
shouldn't get dibs.

128
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,552
Well, maybe we share
the church, you know?

129
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,021
Do all that stuff
on different days.

130
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,555
Hams my biscuits?

131
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:55,226
Hams my biscuits.
That's all I heard.

132
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,728
I mean, I have no idea
what you said after that.

133
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,064
- Going by cubic feet--
- <i>I was kidding.</i>

134

Tara:
<i>Are you okay, Dana?</i>

135
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,705
- It's Denise.
- Denise, I'm sorry.

136
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,007
I'm okay.

137
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,276
I'm the new doctor now.

138
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,978
<i>What's the aspirin for?</i>

139
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,248

140
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,117
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

141
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,986
heard that story.

142
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,587
Fair play.

143
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,690
<i>Listen, I'm a little</i>
<i>nervous here.</i>

144
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,992
I'm a psychiatrist.

145
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,727
I went to med school.

146
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:30,861
<i>I was even gonna be a surgeon,</i>

147
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:32,763
but after the panic attacks,

148
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,266
I got really interested
in psychology.

149
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:38,969
And...
(laughs)

150
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,872
I think I'm really trying
to lower expectations here.

151
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:43,340
Can you do this?

152
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,377
Eugene, shut up.
She can do this.

153
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,145
<i>I'm all this town's got.</i>

154
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:50,948
Pete didn't want me here.

155
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,718
But I'm here now

156
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,953
and I only kind of
want to throw up.

157
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,090
<i>So why the aspirin?</i>

158
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,460
Oh, Eugene and I were working on a
platform for another guard tower.

159
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,329
<i>I got a little dizzy. You
know, I still get headaches.</i>

160
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:06,697
Sit down, I'll take a look.

161
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,571
(sighs)

162
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,506
You're my first patient.

163
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:19,643
And with that symptom, I'm
pretty sure I can't kill you.

164
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,880
I mean, it is possible if you miss,
like, a hematoma or something.

165
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,393
(cooing)

166
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,839
Carl?

167
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,609
What?

168
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:55,246
You heard what I told
Deanna about your group.

169
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,982
What do you want?

170
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,784
It was about me,

171
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:03,454
not you or your group.

172
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,523
I know that now.

173
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,759
I want to help.

174
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:12,429
<i>You tried to teach me</i>

175
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,633
But I'm ready to learn now.

176
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:20,337
I think you need
to tell everybody.

Anybody else down here?

- No.

No, I'm the only one.

You barricade that door

through that door,

you squeeze and you don't stop
till they're on the ground.

How did you learn
how to do that?

374

From a cheese maker.

Yours don't.

394
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:22,289
They may be aiming rifles
