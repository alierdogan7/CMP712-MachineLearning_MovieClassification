00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,224
do you remember anything
after the bus accident?

Why don't I remember?

287
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,350
Uh, well, sometimes

288
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,818
when something traumatic happens,

289
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:17,355
our brain blocks it out
as a defense mechanism,

290
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,469
as a way of protecting ourselves.

291
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,416
The memories usually return

292
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,829
once we're more equipped to deal with them.

293
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,617
So the bus crashed,

00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,836

302
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,365

303

00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,937
This is Dr. Han.

377
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,390
Hello?

378
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:34,909
Why are you walking so fast?

379
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,328
Are you sure you know where she lives?

380
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:40,916
No, I just walked all the way out here
to get even more mountainy mountain air.

381
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:44,419
How come I've never seen you
at the Dog Star before?

382
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:46,471
I've never seen you there either.

383
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:48,923
Really?
Well, I practically live there,

384
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:52,594
so if you did go there,
I'd know you.

385
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,731
- Explain that.
- I can't.

386
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,852
How long have you lived in Caldwell?

387
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:02,937
I was born here.

388
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:07,275
How do you know Rowan?

389
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,495
When I was in high school,
she tutored me for the SATs,

390
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,499
which was a complete waste of time.

391
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:16,334
How do you know her?

392
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:20,338
How much further?

393
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:23,291
That is her townhouse
just there on the right.

394
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,966
You're welcome, asshole.

Rowan, what's going on?

409
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:42,203

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,459
No! No!

414
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:50,878
Open the damn door!

415
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:52,380
Go away!

416
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:55,383
Go away!

417
00:31:58,388 --> 00:31:59,554
Leave me alone!

418
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:01,723
Just go away!

Are you okay, Mommy?

422
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,958
Yeah, sweetie.

423
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:23,161
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

424
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:24,412
Please don't cry.

Hey.

433
00:34:18,778 --> 00:34:20,578
What's the matter?

434
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,749
It started happening again.

435
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:30,922
The Simon stuff?

436
00:34:33,877 --> 00:34:35,877
I thought it was over.

437
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,884
Don't worry.

438
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:45,102
I'm here.

439
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:47,221

448
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:48,950
We need to do it right now.

00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,535
Jack, I'm tired.

450
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,169
I just had to work a double shift.

451
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:55,006
I need you to talk to Camille.

452
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:59,210
I need you to ask her why she's here.

453
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,545
Why she's here?

454
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,846

457
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,470
She's here for Claire.

458
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:14,191
She wants Claire to know that she's okay.

459
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,143
And then?

460
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:23,034
She's going back to the other side,

461
00:36:23,152 --> 00:36:25,319
but she's sending all of you her love.

462
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,657
One more question,

463
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:31,659
what kind of sandwich did she have?

464
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:33,327
What?

465
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:37,331

467
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:41,552
Was it roast beef, turkey, PB&J?

You can channel my dead daughter?
