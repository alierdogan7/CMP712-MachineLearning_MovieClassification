       I'm not seeing any
       tire tracks, Ron.

38
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,837
   A truck woulda left some.

39
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,274
        I had 23 horses
   yesterday, I got 22 today.

40
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,176
        I'm no sheriff,
       but best I figure

41
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,577
   that means one's missing.

42
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,213
        The gate's kinda
         low over here.

43
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,282
    Could it've jumped over?

44
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,851
    Ron: Been raising horses
   on this land for 35 years.

45
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,319
   Never seen one jump loose

46
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,088
    without taking a section
       of fence with 'em.

47
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,025
       Just seems odd to
     me that someone would

48
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,561
   go through all the trouble
      to steal one horse.

49
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,264
  Take two men and a trailer.

50
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,368
       Gates were closed?

51
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,136
  And tied. I'm not an idiot.

52
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,775
         So that's it?

53
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,044
        I'm just out one
       expensive animal?

      for you, Ron, but...

55
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,783
      I'm just not seeing
        anything, here.

56
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,652
 I'm seeing one missing horse!

57
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,954
           Number 88.

58
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,323
    Last night all my horses
     wore numbered bridles,

59
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,925
    like this one, and this
 morning I'm missing number 88.

60
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,227
           Number 88.

61
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,629
     I'll keep an eye out.

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,299
   Ron: I lose another horse,

63
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,968
      you and I are gonna
      have a real problem.

64
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,604
       I wouldn't have it
      any other way, Ron.

          (door slams)

66
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,809
         He definitely
      left that gate open.

67
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,811
              Yep.

        Multiplication.

81
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,083
        So New York's a
        big city, right?

82
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,285
     Yeah, it's pretty big.

83
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,653
      So why'd you leave?

84
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,492
   It was too big. Too noisy.

85
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,995
         Your, um, your
       mom's car's gone?

86
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,197
Yeah, she went to Florida

87
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,699

       Senior bus trips.

88

90
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,606

91
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,541
   She said they're on break,

92
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,575
        so they can plan
     around your schedule.

93
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,577
             Sure.

95
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,884
 I've been talking to someone.

96
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,622
     It's really helped me.

97
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,228

        to go together--

98

             Whoop.

103
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,994

  (chuckles self-consciously)

104

105
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,105

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,687
 That's a tough question, bud.

109
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,326
  Your mom decided to go stay
    with Grandma on her own.

110
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,496
       She can come home
      whenever she wants.

111
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,965
        But she says you
       don't want her to.

112
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,804
       Well, I think what
      she meant was, um...

113
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,609
       That we both have
     things to figure out.

114
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,511
     Is it because of Tim?

115
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:15,981
 No, it's not because of that.

116
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,483
        You understand?

117
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,018
          Yeah, okay.

118
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,187

             Where?

122
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,743

123
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,045

127
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:18,877
         Take your gun.

128
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,546
      I don't need my gun.

129

 Look, I'm gonna go back there

130
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,784

131
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,952
      that there's nothing
     to be scared of, yeah?

132
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,622

149
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,240
   Susan buy him that cereal?

150

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,576

         I don't know.

158
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,015
       I woke up an hour
        ago and saw 'em.

159
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,819
      They look like hoof
      prints from a horse.

160
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,822
   It's hard to tell, but...

161
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,027
    -Paul: Spacing's wrong.
         -Donny: Yeah.

162
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,162
   One in front of the other.

163
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,865
     Like it's on two legs?

164
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,467
   How's that even possible?

165
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,657
       They were looking
        in our windows.

166
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,660
    A lot of houses near my
 apartment have the same thing.

167
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,831
      They go all the way
       to your apartment?

168
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,167
        They go all the
       way through town.

169
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,093
            Come on.

170
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:50,975
  Donny: Yeah, it turned off.

171
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,510
        Going that way.

172
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,751
    Probably just some punk
   kids playing a prank, huh?

173
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,553
     Donny: Yeah, why would
    they come out this far?

174
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,789
     Maybe it's an animal?

175
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,624
       Could be injured.

176
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,725
      Paul: I don't know.

177
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,128
        Whatever it is,

178
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,898
       it could still be
      out there, come on.

179
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,780
        Turned this way.

180
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,649
          Donny: Yeah.

181
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,756
    Paul: It sped up, here.

182
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,225
          Donny: Huh?

183
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,927
         The tracks are
     getting further apart.

184
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,298
     (fallen leaves rustle)

185
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,111
           Hey boss.

186
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,112
      Donny: Better take a
         look at this.

187
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,620
      Donny: They're gone.

188
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,458
        They stop here,
    and they just disappear.

189
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,169
  Paul:<i> It looked like hooves.</i>

190
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,706
      Some are bigger than
     a horse's, but, um...

191
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,444
       on two legs like a
       person or a bear.

192
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,379
    Okay, we're aware of it,

193
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,948
      we're taking care of
      the situation, okay?

194
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,117
           Thank you.

195
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,354
      How can I help you?

196
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,456
             Yeah,
            (sighs)

197
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,858
it does sound like a prank, I...

198
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,560
I'm just trying to be thorough.

199
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,867
    Listen, nothing else has
   been reported in the area.

200
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,902
          Paul: Yeah.

201
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,904
  I agree that it's nuts, yes.

202
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,973
         Yes, but I...

203
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,409
    I'd appreciate it if you
   kept an eye out, as well.

204
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,912
        This thing's got
     people spooked, and...

205
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,916
 A little bit of an explanation
      would go a long way.

206
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,586
          Paul: Yeah.

207
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,356
    I appreciate it. Thanks.

208
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,696
  Well, Forest Department says
    that they've never heard

209
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,100
  of an animal that could walk
   that far on its hind legs.

210
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,005
       Guy laughed at me.

211
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,674
      You know, the people
      are getting panicky.

212
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,677
    I don't know how long we
    can keep spinning this.

213
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,615
     Yeah, whoever did this
  has got a lot to answer for.

214
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,685
 You still think it's a person?

215
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,087
   I mean, those tracks, they
   disappeared into thin air.

216
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,390
     How is a person gonna
   make three miles of tracks

217
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,958
   without any other traces?

218
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,326
 Donny: Doesn't make any sense.

219
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,862
        Ah, don't let it
       get to you, Donny.

220
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,232
    That's exactly what
    whoever did this wants.

221
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,271
      Hopefully this just
        all blows over.

222
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,207
             Yeah.

223
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,977
       You finish up the
     paperwork on my desk?

224
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,245
    Yeah, you got it, boss.

225
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:15,613
         Paul: Thanks.

226
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,787
     Priest:<i> Paul! How are</i>
   <i> you doing this morning?</i>

227
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,122
      I'm good, yourself?

228
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,959
   Quite a little mystery we
   seem to have woken up to.

229
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,128
    Well, nothing mysterious
      about a good prank.

230
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,898
  Can I do something for you?

231
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,633
      Oh, Jonah, my black
    lab ran off last night.

232
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,135
    And it seems I'm not the
    only one missing a pet.

233
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,405
         I'll do what I
        can to find him.

234
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,773
        Priest: I really
         appreciate it.

235
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,076
          -Paul: 'Kay.
   -Priest: Very odd, animals

236
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,112
  acting up the same night as
   this little incident, yes?

237
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,214
        Yes. Yes, it is.

238
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,750
     Seen a fair amount of
    Susan in church, lately.

239
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,086
I haven't seen you in some time.

240
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,623
  Priest: There is no weakness
       in mourning, Paul.

241
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,324
    Accidents happen.

242
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,426
      Turning to something
       outside ourselves,

243
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,694
     every once in awhile?

244
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,429
     That just shows wisdom

245
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,265
        in knowing where
       to find strength.

246
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,267
      The church and I are
     here when you need us.

247
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:10,935
       Thank you, Father.

248
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,169
     Priest: Oh, and, uh...

249
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,172
    People may seem a little
    nervous, right now.

250
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,209
     But they'll follow you
   to the ends of the earth.

251
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:19,710
       Just let them know
      you're leading them

252
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,945
    in the right direction.

253
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,381
            Thanks.

254
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:30,688
 (phone rings in the distance)

255
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,869
 (phone rings in the distance)

256
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,270
     Is everyone all right?

257
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,406
   What's going on, Sheriff?

258
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,544
 I'm trying to figure that out.

259
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,512
    My dad's got some pretty
     crazy ideas about it.

260
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,948
    Yeah, for once that old
    nut bag might be right.

261
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,185
         I bet it's got
      something to do with

262
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,520
        those stories my
    grandpa used to tell me.

263
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,791
        About something
     living in those woods.

264
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,059
          It doesn't.

265
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,428
       Well, what are we
    supposed to do about it?

266
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:48,165
      You don't have to do
anything, all right, we're...

267
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,266
      We're working on it.

268
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,469
    Jim: Oh, is that right?

269
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,172
    Then tell me, why aren't
    you out there right now

270
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,674
    hunting that thing down?

271
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,410
    'Cause it pays to think
      before you act, Jim.

272
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:02,813
       Claire: Well, what
       if it comes back?

273
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,085
    There is no "it", okay?

274
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,156
       There is no "it".

275
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,595
       Forest Department
       said this morning

276
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,397
     that there's no animal
       that leaves tracks

277
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,765
  like the ones that we found.

278
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,099
         Okay, so that
      tells me that we're

279
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,268
         dealing with a
       creative prankster

280
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,404
      who's heard all the
      great ghost stories

281
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,839
      that our buddy Jim,
        here, has heard.

282
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,075
     Well, maybe it's that
      new deputy of yours.

283
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,643
              Hm?

284
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,912
         Jim: City guy,
      thinkin' it's funny

285
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,014
       to stir things up?

286
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,115
         That's enough.

287
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,860
            Sheriff!

288
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:54,665
    How's it going, Sheriff?

289
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,768
  Oh, she's going, Earl. You?

290
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,670
             Good.

291
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,373
        You been out in
       the woods, lately?

292
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,707
        Into the trees?

293
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,776
             Yeah.

294
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,345
    Donny and I went pretty
       deep this morning.

295
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,347
       It's deer season.

296
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,083
        But in the last
      week I haven't seen

297
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,819
   so much as one deer within
    five miles of this town.

298
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,954
  Never seen nothing like it.

299
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,223
      All the animals just
        up and vanished.

300
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,691
              Huh.

301
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,461
    What do you think would
   cause something like that?

302
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,229
       It's hard to say.

303
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,898
             But...

304
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,467
   an animal senses a threat,

305
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,202
 they tend not to hang around.

306
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,637
           A threat.

307
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,641
        So you think an
   animal left those tracks?

308
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,911
    They don't look like any
animal tracks I've ever seen.

309
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,383
You take it easy, now, Sheriff.

310
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,887
      Remember, we're all
     still prayin' for ya.

311
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,389
            Thanks.

312
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,770
          -Susan: Hey.
          -Paul: Hey.

313
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:07,938
       Susan: Thanks for
      taking him, tonight,

314
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,007
     I forgot I volunteered
         at the church.

315
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,075
          No problem.

316
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,278
 I took him to the park today.

317
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:18,849
      The kids there were
     saying it's the devil,

318
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,351
    all this stuff going on.

319
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,186
       Did it scare him?

320
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,621
             Yeah.

321
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,425
  It's been six months, Paul.

322
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,264
 I need to know where you are.

323
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,900
 Susan: Because it's not fair.

324
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,770
    It's not fair to us, and
     it's not fair to Adam.

325
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,577
         Where are you?

326
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,417
         I don't know.

327
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,157
      I'll get him, it'll
       be just a minute.

328
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:09,133
           -(low hum)
  -(car tires crunch on dirt)

329
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,351
          Adam: Stop!

330
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,385
             What?

331
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,587
  There's something out there.

332
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,821
            Enough.

333
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,258
       Last night was one
      thing, buddy, but--

334
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,760
        Dad, look! Look!

335
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,429
     Adam: Did you see it?

336
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,702
         You stay here.

337
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,504
        Lock the doors.

338
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,679
          (doors lock)

339
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,521
       (branches rustle)

340
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,626
             Hey...

341
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:13,030
      ¶ (dramatic music) ¶

342
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,971
         (wood creaks)

343
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,988
 Come out, now, before you get
  yourself into more trouble!

344
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,160
        (metal jingles)

345
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,406
      (metal tags jingle)

346
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,121
         Paul: Adam...

347
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,856
             Adam!

348
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:18,529
             Adam!

349
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,433
       (breathes shakily)
             Adam!

350
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,206
             Adam!

351
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,409
             Adam!

352
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:35,813
           Adam: Dad?

353
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,587
         Are you hurt?

354
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,423
   I heard something outside
   the car and I got scared.

355
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,094
      I'm never gonna let
    anything happen to you.

356
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,730
    Do you understand that?

357
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,638
            (sighs)

358
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,645
      -Earl: Here you go.
   -Bar Patron: Thanks, Earl.

359
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,251
   You drinking to remember,

360
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,519
 or are you drinking to forget?

361
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,689
       I'll take another
    and see where it leads.

362
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,924
         How's it going
     with Sheriff Sheilds?

363
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,192
        He's a good man.

364
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,529
             Yeah.

365
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,933
     So how you likin' it?

366
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,269
    The town, not my booze,

367
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,537
    I know my booze is good.

368
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,606
        It's different.

369
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,209
     -Good kinda different.
             -Hmm.

370
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,146
       Lot of excitement,
      tracks in the snow.

371
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,615
              Hmm.

372
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,583
       How much you know
       about this place?

373
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:47,851
        And them woods?

374
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,224
     Yeah, my grandma, she
    was full blood Shawnee.

375
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,226
Used to tell stories passed down

376
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,529
 by our people for generations.

377
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,665
       Oh, yeah? Stories?

378
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,967
    Mmhmm, about them woods.

379
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,235
   And what lived out there.

380
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,739
        The spirits that
      roamed in the trees.

381
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,609
    See they, they say when
    the white man came here,

382
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,712
  he didn't respect the land,
        or the spirits.

383
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,347
    So they came after 'em.

384
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,884
   Men, women, the children.

385
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,721
         Do you, uh...

386
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,424
  Do you believe the stories?

387
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,326
    Well, when I was young,

388
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,762
      there was a boy went
   missing up in them woods.

389
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,398
         They searched.

390
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,901
    When they found him, his
  body was 30 feet up a tree.

391
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,170
       So let's just say,

392
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,106
     I believe it enough to
      keep my door locked.

393
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,542
  You be careful, now, Deputy.

394
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,944
         Wouldn't wanna
      find you up a tree.

395
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,449
       Claire: Hey, Earl.

396
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,750
      Earl: Hello, ladies.

397
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,122
         What'll it be?

398
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:04,094
  (Claire gives order quietly)

399
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,262
     I'm a little confused
     as to why we're here.

400
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,898
         When children
      pick up a new word,

401
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,666
they tend to say it constantly.

402
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,835
       It only gets worse
        when they learn

403
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,704
       we don't want them
       to say that word.

404
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,239
          Did Adam say
      something offensive?

405
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,991
    Mr. and Mrs. Shields...

406
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,594
            Pecker?
            (laughs)

407
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,096
      -Paul: We're sorry.
         -Susan: Sorry.

408
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,667
     About a week ago Adam
 called another child a pecker,

409
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,604
     and since then all the
 children have been saying it.

410
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:24,908
  -We can't get them to stop.
    -(Susan and Paul laugh)

411
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,711
       But as I can see,
 apparently, some people don't

412
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,947
     view this as quite the
   serious matter that it is.

413
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,515
       We do, we do, I...

414
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,984
We're sorry, we'll talk to him.

415
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,285
     It won't happen again.

416
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:37,688
   There is one other thing.

417
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,123
          What's that?

418
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,459
     When he refers to Tim,

419
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,695
       he always seems to
     use the present tense.

420
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,964
  Teacher: "Tim is, Tim can."

421
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,365
       Is there something
        wrong with that?

422
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,068
     Teacher: Referring to
    someone who is deceased

423
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,838
       in such a way just
        seems unhealthy.

424
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,506
        I don't see how
       that's a problem.

425
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,777
      More times than not,
     when parents separate

426
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,912
  it's the children that get--

427
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,380
      Tim is his brother.

428
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,650
       My child can refer
         to his brother

429
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,251
  however the hell he chooses.

430
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,720
   Teacher: I beg your pard--

431
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,121
  Susan: And you are not gonna
 tell us how to raise our son.

432
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,089
     Do you understand me?

433
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,090
       Mrs. Shields, I--

434
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,558
     Do you understand me?

435
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,208
             (sobs)

436
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,635
          Donny: Hey.

437
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:34,071
     I called you, before.

438
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,540
    Is everything all right?

439
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,541
             Yeah.

440
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,242
I was just calling to check in.

441
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,351
            I was...

442
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,953
   It's none of my business.

443
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:57,994
           -(rumble)
  -(birds tweeting agitatedly)

444
00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,429
         You hear that?

445
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:06,336
         (rumble grows)

446
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,283
   What the hell is going on?

447
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,688
      (wings flap rapidly)

448
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:33,897
           Thank you.

449
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,341
        I've never seen
      anything like that.

450
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,145
       Earl Everheart...

451
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,181
He came up to me the other day.

452
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,152
He said all the wildlife's gone.

453
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,554
Paul: Those birds were leaving.

454
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,257
     It's closer to spring
       than fall, they...

455
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,392
        They're supposed
    to be flying north.

456
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,728
   And they were going south.

457
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,763
         Did he mention
      any of his theories

458
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,665
      about what he thinks
       might be going on?

459
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,701
  I was at his bar last night,

460
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,003
he had some pretty crazy ideas.

461
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,905
 Those are just stories, Donny.

462
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,507
     Paul: And people have
       been telling them

463
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,509
  around here for a long time.

464
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,745
         Earl was just
      having fun with you.

465
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,248
    But what if they're not?

466
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,751
Donny: What if there's something
    wrong about these woods?

467
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,055
    He said something about
     his Indian ancestors,

468
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,256
  they knew about a creature--

469
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,258
         He's about as
      Indian as you or I.

470
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,529
   You really think there's a
  monster in the woods, Donny?

471
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,199
              No.

472
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:43,266
             Okay.

473
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,571
             But...

474
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,239
These stories, they just sounded

475
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,774
a lot like what's been going on.

476
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,776
      Donny: I don't know.

477
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,646
     And then he mentioned
     something about a boy.

478
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,415
         -(Paul sighs)
-Donny: He was out in the woods

479
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:02,152
        a few years ago,
   and then he went missing.

480
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,553
       They couldn't find
        him until they--

481
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,455
       They found a body
        up in the tree.

482
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,257
             Right.

483
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,794
 That boy was murdered, Donny.

484
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,562
      No monsters needed.

485
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,473
       Bad things happen,
 'cause people let them happen.

486
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,650
    Paul:<i> Somebody's always</i>
     <i> responsible, Donny.</i>

487
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,819
         (tag jingles)

488
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,355
          (Paul sighs)

489
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,903
        (engine starts)

490
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,338
     Donny: Yeah, all good.

491
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,176
Susan: Thank you so much, Donny.

492
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,379
       Yeah, my pleasure.

493
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,848
Actually, my dad was a mechanic.

494
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,350
     I always thought I was
    gonna end up being one.

495
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,952
        Why didn't you?

496
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,821
  After my mom left us, uh...

497
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,091
      I spent so much time
     in the police station

498
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,359
      bailing my dad out.

499
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,697
    Just, uh, figured I may
     as well become a cop.

500
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:27,304
        Has he told you?

501
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:30,874
           About Tim?

502
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,179
    Susan:<i> I had taken Adam</i>
        <i> to a friend's,</i>

503
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,415
  <i> and Paul was watching Tim.</i>

504
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,884
        <i> We had one of</i>
      <i> those kiddy pools.</i>

505
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:46,523
   They think he slipped and
  hit his head on the bottom.

506
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,062
           I'm sorry.

507
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,265
Susan:<i> I don't blame him,</i>
          <i> you know</i> .

508
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:56,733
     <i> It was an accident.</i>

509
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,203
     <i> It wasn't his fault,</i>
<i> it could've so easily been me.</i>

510
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,207
       <i> The problem is,</i>
      <i> he blames himself.</i>

511
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,845
He doesn't think he deserves
   what he has, but he does.

512
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,783
 It's hard to make somebody see

513
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,518
       in themselves what
        you see in them.

514
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,027
            (sighs)

515
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:45,615
       ¶ (eerie music) ¶

  -(wheels crunch over gravel)

519
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:08,772
      Claire: I don't want
   you to get yourself shot!

520
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,673
     Ron: I'm gonna handle
    this right now, myself!

521
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,976
     I'm gonna handle this
       myself, right now.

522
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,677
        -(Paul murmurs)
    -Claire: Calm down, Dad.

523
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,945
     Listen to the sheriff.

524
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,947
        Hey, calm down.

525
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,517
        Claire said that
     you think something's

526
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,285
  still bothering your horses,
          that right?

527
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,622
   Past few days, the horses
     have been real uneasy.

528
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:27,424
 Jumping around in the stalls.

529
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,260
   But for the life of me, I
couldn't figure out what it was.

530
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,327
        Till last night.

531
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,996
   What happened last night?

532
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,898
       'Bout 3 o'clock I
      hear someone bangin'

533
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,099
    on the side of the barn.

534
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,500
       Beatin' the living
        hell out of it.

535
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,235
 -So tonight I'm ready for him.
         -Claire: Dad!

536
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,303
  Ron: Now, get outta my way!

537
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,438
      Paul: Hey, hey, hey.

538
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,706
    Now, what if it's...

539
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,874
    What if it's one of the
        neighbor's boys

540
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:45,975
      just playing around?

541
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:48,845
   Paul: Come on, gimme this.
            Come on.

542
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,314
         Come on. Good.

543
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,850
        (horse whinnies)

544
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,285
        Those horses--

545
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,387
  Are your livelihood, I know.

546
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:00,156
       Paul: I know, Ron.

547
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,294
 Now look, if you hear anything
     coming from that barn,

548
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,797
      you call me at home
      and I'll come over.

549
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,699
       We'll take care of
      this the right way.

550
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,502
          -Ron: Yeah.
       -(horse whinnies)

551
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,971
             Good.

552
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,039
        There they are!

553
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,074
          -Stand back.
        -(horses squeal)

554
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,343
        Donny: Get back.

555
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,644
       (horses whinny and
      kick at barn walls)

556
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,645
             Donny?

557
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,314
          Yeah, boss?

558
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,916
     You make sure that Ron
   and his shotgun stay here.

559
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:34,157
        -(horses whinny)
     -(bang from the barn)

560
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,261
   -(knocking from the barn)
        -(horses whinny)

561
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,855
              Hey!

562
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,458
          -Paul: Hey!
        -Get in, get in.

563
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,728
          -Paul: Hey!
            -Boss!

564
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:14,030
        Donny: You okay?

565
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,533
          What was it?

566
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,302
         I don't know.

567
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,275
         It's too dark.

568
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,711
        (horse whinnies)

569
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,146
   Come back in the morning.

570
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,406
         Paul: Assuming

571
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:59,309
   that this wall wasn't like
    this before last night?

572
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:04,113
           -Ron: No.
    -Donny: Look at the mud.

573
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,856
        Ron: I shoed all
     the horses last week.

574
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,292
        And these tracks
      ain't got any shoes.

575
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,795
       And look at this.

576
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,597
       The size is right
       for horse tracks,

577
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,532
         the two cloven
      halves are the same,

578
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:23,633
      but this right here?

579
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,668
    This ridge ain't normal.

580
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:29,005
 It's like the hoof is divided
   into three narrow pieces.

581
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:37,313
         A hoof divided
       into three parts.

582
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,149
 What purpose would that serve?

583
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:42,151
       I haven't got the
    faintest idea, Sheriff.

584
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,387
     Ron:<i> Before right now,</i>

00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,661
       Right after lunch.

609

00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:39,395
      Adam, I don't think
    that this is the place--

620
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,863
              Yes.

621
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:46,836
  But sometimes it's a little
    harder than that, buddy.

622
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,087
 Radio:<i> In local weather news,</i>

          Oh. Coffee.

634
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,776
 It's up front by the squirrel.

635
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,180
         (Donny laughs)

636
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:39,689
         So is it true?
   You're from New York City?

637
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,924
           Ah, yeah.

638
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,093
    I've always wanted to go
   there and ride the subway.

639
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,798
      Most people wanna go
   see the Statue of Liberty.

640
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,733
Well, I'm not most people.

641
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,202
        The subway's not
       really that great.

642
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,204
       It's full of bums
        and pickpockets.

643
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,240
        (Claire laughs)
   Well, no wonder you left.

644
00:47:58,843 --> 00:47:59,976
    So why'd you come here?

645
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,246
     Oh, you know, just...

646
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,715
        Change of pace.

647
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,316
         Well, normally
      I'd say this town's

648
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,085
  pace-deprived, but lately...

649
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,787
      Yeah, yeah, it's not
    exactly what I expected.

650
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,490
 So you'll be leaving us, then?

651
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:17,126
 Nah, I just found the coffee.

652
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,462
         Who knows what
      I'll find tomorrow?

653
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:26,102

       Paul: Hey, Donny,
       is your radio on?

656
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:50,877
          Yeah, boss.

657
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:51,394
  Paul: (radio)<i> Need to clear</i>
   <i> a deer from the highway</i>

659
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:54,931
    We'll have to come pick
   it up tomorrow, some time.

660
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,833
  Maybe it died of loneliness.

661
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:00,102

673
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,249
          Donny: Hey.

674
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:55,051
  You take care of that deer?

675
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,654
 Let's find somewhere to talk.

676
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,891
  Paul: I think we're thinking
   about this the wrong way.

677
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:05,928
  I think that deer was all...

678
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,596
           Who knows?

679
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:08,664
     Other deer were gone,

680
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,765
        that one wasn't.

681
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,802
        It looked older.

682
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,304
   Maybe it couldn't keep up,

683
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,806
      maybe all the other
      ones left it behind,

684
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:18,240
      I'm not really sure.

685
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,608
  Hey, you're losing me, boss.

686
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,610
  Ron Jenkins' missing horse.

687
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,713
         We thought Ron
      left the gate open.

688
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:25,848
             Yeah.

689
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,484
          I no longer
      think that's right.

690
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,187
             'Kay.

691
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:34,323
        The claw marks.

692
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,033
       First I thought it
        was coincidence,

693
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:46,035
          or part of a
    well-thought-out prank.

694
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,238
        Deep cuts on the
      tree in the forest.

695
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,441
    I mean, it meant nothing
       to me at the time.

696
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:55,644
      Just now, that dead
      deer on the road...

697
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:00,316
    It had four razor sharp
  cuts right through its body.

698
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:02,251
           Same ones?

699
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,352
           Same size.

700
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:05,888
   Those stories you heard...

701
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:09,024
  I'm not saying that they're
      all accurate, but...

702
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,129
  I think we might be dealing
     with something that's

703
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,698
     not easily explained.

704
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,602
  A few years ago I saw on TV,
  they caught this giant fish

705
00:52:19,604 --> 00:52:21,904
        off the coast of
      Taiwan or somewhere.

706
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,140
     They thought that this
     thing had been extinct

707
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,741
  for like, millions of years.

708
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:27,510
    Then, bam, there it is.

709
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,345
        Right under our
     noses the whole time.

710
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:30,980
 Swimming around in the ocean.

711
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,215
So what I'm saying is, maybe...

712
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,719
     Maybe this thing that
       we're looking for,

713
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,155
  maybe it's always been here.

714
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,258
And we're just now noticing it.

715
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:44,994
          So why now?

716
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,039
              Oh.

717
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:58,774
     Sheriff Paul Shields.

718
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:01,810
      You boys any closer
         to finding out

719
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,012
         what's running
     around in them woods?

720
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,115
       You know, I don't
   normally see you in this,

721
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,050
    this fine establishment.

722
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,086
      'Course, I see your
    deputy in here enough to

723
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,788
      lower my confidence.

724
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,857
        -Can I hit him?
              -No.

725
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,929
Everyone around here trusts you.

726
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:22,598
    I can't figure out why.

727
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,601
     Man can't even protect
        his own family.

728
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,037
      Now, can I hit him?

729
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:32,575
      I'm still deciding.

730
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,281
         Jim: You boys
      have a good evening.

731
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:42,218
 We got the utmost faith in ya.

732
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,119
          (Jim laughs)

733
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,561
  Jim: Go get me a beer, dude!

734
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,729
        Paul: Let's go.

735
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,426
  (branches rustle violently)

736
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,833
     I think it was a bear.

737
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,201
           That fast?

738
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,269
              Shh.

739
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,772
       (creature snarls)

740
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:48,150
       (branches rustle)

741
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,554
       (creature snarls)

742
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,325
        -(gunshot bangs)
          -(man yells)

743
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,515
      You know, it's kinda
   funny you never asked me.

744
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,686
     What you shoulda asked
      me in our interview.

745
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:25,988
        You know, why a
       guy from New York

746
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:28,057
     would come out here to
basically the middle of nowhere.

747
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,192
      You got shot, Donny.

748
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,762
   Paul: That's reason enough
            for me.

749
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,266
I know what it's like, to uh...

750
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,703
   Have people always telling
 you that it wasn't your fault.

751
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:45,908
        I don't need to
      know anything else.

752
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:57,753
    Donny: Do you ever pray?

753
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,590
 I mean, I never used to pray.

754
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:03,525
             But...

755
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,362
   When I was on that gurney,

756
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,698
     and they told me that
       my father died...

757
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,801
   You know, things had been
     going so well for me.

758
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,937
I was moving up in the force,

759
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,272
       I had a nice girl.

760
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,645
        Ever since then,
   I've been asking God why.

761
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:30,052
      But, uh, now I think
       maybe I know why.

762
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,791
      Maybe I wasn't where
     I was supposed to be.

763
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,963
          (Paul sighs)

764
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,933
      Is this where you're
     supposed to be, Donny?

765
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,937
    Paul: Is this where God
        told you to be?

766
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,142
     We all have a purpose.

767
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,077
   Ours is to protect people.

768
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,281
  Maybe there's somebody here
    I'm supposed to protect.

769
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:02,351
         There you go.

770
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:12,661
        Or maybe you're
    supposed to protect me.

771
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:31,146
       (engine shuts off)

772
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:55,637
          (twig snaps)

773
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,586
       (branches rustle)

774
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,230
        (eerie clicking)

775
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,833
        (child's muffled
        laughter echoes)

776
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,347
              Tim?

777
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,520
     Please! It's after me.

778
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,421
 It's in the woods, behind me.

779
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,689
            Please!

780
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,425
     (man pants for breath)

781
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,866
       We'd been hunting
        for a few hours.

782
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,369
 Hunter: Hadn't seen anything.

783
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,638
And then we came upon something.

784
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,441
  And we started tracking it.

785
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,544
      It had to be a deer.

786
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:12,381
   We thought somehow it just
    wandered right past us.

787
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:13,749
      Then what happened?

788
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:18,086
     It was fast, so fast.

789
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:20,088
Hunter: It got Manny, first.

790
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:25,127
           Then Ryan,
   he was screaming in pain.

791
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,429
        Did you see it?

792
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,766
    I don't know what I saw.

793
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,306
 We'll start searching for 'em.

794
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,308
     Hunter: Don't bother.

795
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,810
     They're already dead.

796
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:46,081
   Paul:<i> Assuming that there</i>
    <i> is some sort of animal</i>

797
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,483
     in these woods that's
     never been discovered,

798
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,453
  how could that be possible?

799
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,290
        How could it go
     unnoticed for so long?

800
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:58,794
      Donny: I don't know.

801
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,463
       What if it's like

802
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,801
    your prehistoric fish
     that we talked about?

803
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,938
       Maybe it's adapted
      to its environment.

804
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,178
Maybe it's learned how to hide.

805
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,883
   What if it's smart enough
  to know that we're a threat?

806
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,686
              Huh?

807
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,956
      To know to avoid us,
     till it has no choice.

808
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,827
        That'd be a very
       dangerous animal.

813
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,369
         Donny: Oh, no.

814
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:15,470
           How the...

815
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:16,805
          Earl: Yeah.

816
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:17,906
      No animal I know of
        kills like that.

817
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,416
          Any tracks?

818
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,384
              No.

819
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,852
         It's too cold,
     the ground's too hard.

820
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,860
       You boys get outta
     these woods right now.

821
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,429
           What? Why?

822
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,297
  Come on, Paul, it's the last
  two weeks of huntin' season.

823
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,434
      Whatever did this is
     still in those trees.

824
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:46,968
          Yeah, that's
     exactly why I wanna--

825
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,603
 We're gonna handle this, Jim.

826
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,739
     Paul: You understand?

827
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,709
       No one from town's
   allowed into these woods.

828
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:58,213
  We make sure everyone is in
 their house before nightfall.

829
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,281
         Okay, Sheriff.

830
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,651
       You got that, Jim?

831
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,189
       Paul:<i> I understand</i>
     <i> what you're saying.</i>

832
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,991
       No, I do, but what
        I'm telling you

833
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,359
    is that people have been

834
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,228
      attacked and killed
         in our woods.

835
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,732
   Paul:<i> Two dozen men armed</i>
    <i> enough to get a handle</i>

836
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,900
      on this in 24 hours,
   that's what you're saying?

837
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:21,903
       I have your word?

838
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,942
     -Yeah. Yeah, you too.
         -(phone beeps)

839
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:30,579
Donny: The coroner's gonna have

840
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:31,913
    a hell of a time getting
       those bodies down.

841
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:33,715
             Yeah.

842
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:34,783
    What'd the Rangers say?

843
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,486
           24 hours.

844
01:02:37,888 --> 01:02:40,021
   Paul: At least most people
   left 'cause of the storm.

845
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,490
     We'll be fine in town.

846
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,459
         We'll make do.

847
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,329

          Donny: Hey,
      finished my rounds.

867
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,835
  Most of the town evacuated.

868
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,536
          -Paul: Good.
    -Donny: What's going on?

869
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,071
        Paul: I'm gonna
      show you something.

870
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,341
     I put a call into the
     Sheriff up in Tanner,

871
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:08,710
   when I heard the news said
     the wildlife migration

872
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:09,778
    affected them, as well.

873
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,280
     Paul: He sent me this.

874
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,050
Two weeks ago, a crew of loggers

875
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,052
       went missing just
       outside of Tanner.

876
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:19,087
    I think that the logging

877
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:22,190
      it forced the animal
    south towards us.

878
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,525
        All these years,
     it's been able to live

879
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,427
        in these remote
      parts of the forest.

880
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:30,398
  There's a police report for
 two missing cattle in Tanner.

881
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,701
    And then two days later,
          yours truly.

882
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,336
     -(bridle tag jingles)
          -Number 88.

883
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:35,871
  Ron Jenkins' missing horse.

884
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,708
   So the foresting, it just
flushed it out right towards us.

885
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,909
         And there's...

886
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,278
        There's no more
      forest to the south.

887
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,947
       -So it's trapped.
    -Paul: It's threatened.

888
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,550
     I think it's fighting
         for territory.

889
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,388
           Sit down.

890
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:55,023
       (knocking at door)

891
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,224
  Get caught up on this stuff.

892
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,525
       (knocking at door)

893
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:58,793
             Yeah.

894
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:09,437
        I keep a camera
       out in the woods,

895
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:13,141
     so I can keep track of
   the larger bucks at night.

896
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:15,944
   It has an infrared sensor.

897
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,647
      Records any movement
      when it's triggered.

898
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:24,586
 What are we looking for, Jim?

899
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:26,755
         You'll know it
        when you see it.

900
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:49,811
             Whoa.

901
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:54,983
          That was it.

902
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:56,718
     It coulda been a deer.

903
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:58,486
  Yeah, that's what I figured.

904
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:01,790
 Till I looked at the footage.

905
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,060
        I looked closer,
        and caught this.

906
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:18,807
Jim: I'll leave these with you.

907
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:21,910
             Okay.

908
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,181
        Yeah, I'm gonna
      head out too, boss.

909
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,519
      You notice the cell
        service is down?

910
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,255
 Always happens during a storm.

911
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:38,827
    All right, I'll see you
     in the morning, boss.

912
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:48,703

Paul: Get in the bathroom, now.

920
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:31,179
        Get up, come on.

925
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,238
       -(creature growls)
       -(footsteps thud)

926
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,176
             Donny?

927
01:08:02,946 --> 01:08:04,112
             Donny?

928
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:06,114
Hey, boss, you say something?

929
01:08:07,017 --> 01:08:10,085
    -(creature growls)
        -(items clatter)

930
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:12,787
  I think there's interference
 from the storm, or something.

931
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:14,189
   Donny, it's in the house.

932
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:15,957
Paul: (radio)<i> It's in the house.</i>

933
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,092
          I'm coming.

934
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:18,993
         -(siren wails)
     -Hold on, I'm coming.

935
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,998
  (creature's footsteps thump)

936
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:34,175
       -(footsteps thump)
        -(stairs creak)

937
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:07,842
         (siren wails)

938
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,548
        (creature roars)

939
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:21,556
        (glass shatters)

940
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,960
    (footsteps thud rapidly)

941
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,228
        (creature roars)

942
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:37,505
           Stay here.

943
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:40,708
              No!

944
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:43,244
        Just stay down.

945
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:45,280
       Lock this door as
      soon as I step out.

946
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:48,449
      Okay? It'll be fine.

947
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:01,796
         -(Donny yells)
    -(footsteps gallop away)

948
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,532
           (gunshot)

949
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,568
  Paul: Donny! You all right?

950
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:07,735
     -Paul: You all right?
         -Donny: Yeah.

951
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,537
     Paul: Did you see it?

952
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,039
    It just knocked into me.

953
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,809
    All right, let's gather
     everyone left in town.

954
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,111
    We'll stay at the church
            tonight.

955
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,749
          (wind blows)

956
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:30,258
       You all know about
        the tracks found

957
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,626
 going through town, this week.

958
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:37,632
    Yesterday, we discovered
     the bodies of two men

959
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,468
    in the woods just
        outside of town.

960
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:44,005
  Now, what left those tracks
     also killed those men.

961
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:45,940
        A lot of people
       have long believed

962
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:48,810
         that something
      lives in our woods.

963
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:52,413
  I didn't wanna alarm any of
 you until I knew for certain,

964
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,916
but tonight it attacked my home.

965
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:58,987
        A few weeks ago,

966
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:03,091
    a logging camp opened up
    90 miles north of here.

967
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:07,428
    We believe that it drove
      the creature south,

968
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:09,330
    looking for a new home.

969
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,167
    With the animals on the
  run, it's looking for food.

970
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:15,470
        And it found us.

971
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,639
          It's strong.

972
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,208
   It's fast, and it's smart.

973
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,678
   But I believe that we can
   get through this together.

974
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:27,849
   So we're gonna stay here,
            tonight.

975
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,119
  As soon as that storm passes

976
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:33,321
      and the roads clear
        in the morning,

977
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,189
the Forest Department will have

978
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:37,759
        Rangers crawling
    all over these woods

979
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,060
    to hunt this thing down.

980
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,797
   How many Rangers, Sheriff?

981
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,166
            Dozens.

982
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,338
    All we have to do is get
through the night, and we will.

983
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:53,041
       How do we know it
   won't just find us, here?

984
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,411
      It's a trap, like a
     bunch of damned rats.

985
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,982
   This church, it's our best
        and only option.

986
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,718
       Paul: It's strong,
        it's defendable.

987
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,555
    Once morning comes,
        you'll be safe.

988
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,358
  This is where we need to be.

989
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:18,366
          (wind blows)

990
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,008
          (gun clicks)

991
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:44,592
         Ah, thank you.

992
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,067
     Susan: Is it that bad?

993
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,438
          (Paul sighs)
       Oh, no, it's uh...

994
01:13:01,478 --> 01:13:02,944
    It's just a precaution.

995
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,448
         You never were
       a good liar, Paul.

996
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:18,292
       That's all right,
         I gave it up.

997
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,294
           Good man.

998
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,897
      Situation like this,
    most men start drinking.

999
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,733
  You don't seem too worried,
           yourself.

1000
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,302
    Ah, worrying never added
    a day to anybody's life.

1001
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:31,572
     You know what happens
      after a forest fire?

1002
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,242
   Land comes back stronger.

1003
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,345
            Well...

1004
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:40,148
      I guess I'm drinking
      for both of us, huh?

1005
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:46,154
     Susan: Adam wanted to
      draw, he was bored.

1006
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:13,815
     (Donny laughs quietly)

1007
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,117
  So what are we drinking to?

1008
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,519
             Hope.

1009
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,121
 Sometimes that's all you got.

1010
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,732
        I guess hope is
   what we'll roll with, huh?

1011
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,139
          -Donny: Hey.
             -Hey.

1012
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:43,144
         How you doing?

1013
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,848
Susan: You were good out there.

1014
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,518
       I'm serious, Paul.

1015
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:54,822
       They believe that
     you can protect them.

1016
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,892
  That no matter what happens,
      they can trust you.

1017
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,232
 I can't protect these people.

1018
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:09,504
    I couldn't protect Tim.

1019
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:13,074
     It wasn't your fault.

1020
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:16,177
     He loved you so much.

1021
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:18,246
He wouldn't want you to be sad.

1022
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:20,848
          I've been...

1023
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,351
I've been seeing him, lately.

1024
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:29,090
           He's there
    and then he disappears.

1025
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:35,730
  I feel like I'm going crazy.

1026
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:39,233
            Maybe...

1027
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:41,903
   He just wants you to know
    that everything is okay?

1028
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:43,304
     I shoulda been there.

1029
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:47,108
    I shoulda protected him.

1030
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,283
     I am so sorry, Susan.

1031
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:57,451
         I'm so sorry.

1032
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,654
I shouldn't have moved out.

1033
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,023
    I shouldn't have let you
 think that I didn't need you.

1034
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:03,558
   Because I need you, Paul.

1035
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,792
        Adam needs you.

1036
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,397
     These people need you.

1037
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:28,149
(sudden thud against the doors)

1038
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:32,687
          -Adam: Mom!
         -Susan: Adam!

1039
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,424
         -(heavy thud)
       -(creature growls)

1040
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:37,491
             Boss!

1041
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,032
          Donny: Boss!

1042
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,535
         (muffled thud)

1043
01:16:49,906 --> 01:16:51,072
        (people exclaim)

1044
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:52,807
 Man: It's okay, here, come on.

1045
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:53,941
       Come on, come on.

1046
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:56,210
    I gotcha. Stay with--

1047
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:58,012
         -(loud thuds)
   -(several people cry out)

1048
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,115
     Everyone away from the
     windows and the door.

1049
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,217
     Paul: Just stay calm.

1050
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:04,986
  Donny: Stay calm, everybody.

1051
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:11,192
       -(creature growls)
         -(door thuds)

1052
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:14,862
          -(gun cocks)
         -(door thuds)

1053
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:16,397
   You think it's gonna hold?

1054
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,367
          No, I don't.

1055
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,037
        The basement...

1056
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,805
        It was a shelter
       in the 60s, right?

1057
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,840
   Yeah, but it's jam packed.

1058
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:27,008
  I don't think we'll all fit.

1059
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,409
     It's gonna have to do.

1060
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:29,844
            Come on!
 Everyone downstairs, let's go.

1061
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,746
           Let's go!

1062
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,913
       (people speak over
     each other excitedly)

1063
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,248
        Donny: Come on,
    now, let's go, quickly.

1064
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,485
         (door pounds)

1065
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:38,686
        Go, go, go. Go.

1066
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:45,860
       -(people chatter)
     -Ron: Watch your step.

1067
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:51,999
  Donny: Come on, guys. Quick!

1068
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:59,573
      (pounding continues
         from upstairs)

1069
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,514
 Donny, get these rifles ready.

1070
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:08,015
    Lock and guard the door.

1071
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:08,916
      -Donny: Wait, wait,
    -Susan: What's going on?

1072
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:09,950
  Donny: where are you going?

1073
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,085
(pounding intensifies upstairs)

1074
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:16,123
       Those doors aren't
    gonna hold much longer.

1075
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,425
           Don't go.

1076
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,560
      It's gonna be okay,
   the doors are gonna hold.

1077
01:18:20,063 --> 01:18:21,128
          I love you.
