40 women in Europe.
Nearly 100 of the world. - And the men?

186
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,618
Are extinct.
- They were too loud, too greedy and too stupid.

187
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,768
One part was the hand of man, the rest
We have killed himself and vowed to

188
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,213
never to bite another, the gift
carries. - Long live the liberation!

189
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,933

And why do you treat him so bad?

203
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,259
I do not want to hurt him.
- But you have now!

204
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,373

Do not know.

218
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,699
I'm afraid of missing something.

00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,900
Sounds cool.

260
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,693
Did I say something wrong?

261
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,097
I must go. - Real, right?
Yes.

262
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,736

(Operatic aria)

273
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,338
Have you had enough of the nightlife?

274
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,894
Louise would say now,
You get used up.

275

00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,338
after which she studied for centuries.

278
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,249
You should not disappoint them better.

279
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:58,012
I was a very untalented actress.
Talking movies I would not have survived.

280
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,691
Louise and I were at the premiere
the first time taken.

281
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,611
My husband and my little daughter
are then driven up already.

282
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:17,053
If you had bitten me otherwise?
Or Nora? Or Lena?

Oh, Charlotte spoil us not the evening.

01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:59,379
How does he know you?
- I 've got a little something done wrong.
