00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:05,807
The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.

3
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:08,851
Then what's wrong with them?

4
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,318
Those lights don't seem to be
in just the right place.

5
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:13,948
They're both a bit out of position,
according to this.

6
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:16,686
Two light buoys mean a safe channel
between the world over.

7
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,662
"Safe between the world over"
doesn't go in these waters.

8
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,292
Look here. You'll see the water
shoals on the island side...

9
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:28,166
while the deep soundings
run to the mainland.

10
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,172
Have any of you seen
the captain today?

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,802
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch.

12
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,109
He hasn't left the bridge since you
decided to come through the channel.

13
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,115
What are you driving at?

14
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:43,584
Ever since you gave him those orders
yesterday to cut through these waters...

15
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:45,814
he's had the jitters.

16
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,882
There's something wrong. I...
Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.

17
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,450
[Chuckling]
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?

18
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,997
- Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle.

19
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:58,193
- No! I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.

20
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:02,400
Just what you need.

21
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,964
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy.

22
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,502
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,483
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.

24
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,487
We're heading straight for the channel
between Branca Island and the mainland.

25
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:23,015
- Good.
- But the lights are just a bit off,
according to the chart.

26
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,960
The charts are never up to date in this
part of the Pacific. You know that.

27
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,224
I know, sir, but...

28
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:30,630
Doesn't Branca Island
mean anything to you?

29
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,897
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford...

30
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,904
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter.

31
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:39,430
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.

32
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,739
I'll call him.

33
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:44,871
- Oh, Bob. Bob!
- [Man] What is it?

34
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:46,973
- Come up here, will ya?
- Just a minute.

35
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,575
What's bothering you, Captain?

36
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:54,089
There are no more coral-reefed,
shark-infested waters
in the whole world than these.

37
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:56,921
Boy! Just take a look at these.

38
00:03:56,993 --> 00:04:00,394
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter,
Doc, but oh, what a photographer.

39
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,590
If we'd had you to take pictures
on the Sumatran trip...

40
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:04,599
they might have believed my book.

41
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,465
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip,
you'd have never had me on this one.

42
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:13,100
[Laughs] Say, here's a swell one of
the ship, Skipper. What's the matter?

43
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:15,167
These old sea dogs tell yarns
to kid each other...

44
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:17,179
and end up
believing it all themselves.

45
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,340
I think that Mr. Rainsford
should know...

46
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,010
that the channel lights aren't just
in the position given on the charts.

47
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:25,020
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellas?

48
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:28,182

and take the outside course.

Let's talk this over.

54
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,739
- There's no use taking any chances.
- Chances? That's fine talk...

slapping tigers in the face.

57
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,517
And he talks about taking chances.

Here's the doc charging the enemy
with an unloaded camera.

59
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:01,923
Get the expression
on Doc's face, Bill.

60
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,925
He looks more frightened
than the tiger.

61
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,860
- He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc?

62
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,990
I'll tell you
what I had on my mind.

63
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,502
I was thinking of the inconsistency
of civilization.

64
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,768
The beast of the jungle killing just
for his existence is called savage.

65
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:21,174
The man, killing just for sport,
is called civilized.

66
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,337
- Hear! Hear!
- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?

67
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,540
Now, just a minute.
What makes you think...

68
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:29,415
it isn't just as much sport
for the animal as it is for the man?

69
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,477
Take that fellow right there,
for instance.

70
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,852
There never was a time
when he couldn't have gotten away.

71
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:37,017
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.

72
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:39,027
He didn't hate me
for stalking him...

73
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,928
any more than I hated him
for trying to charge me.

74
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:43,932
As a matter of fact,
we admired each other.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,766
Perhaps, but would you change places
with the tiger?

- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

82
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:08,889
I asked you if there'd be
as much sport in the game...

83
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,892
if you were the tiger
instead of the hunter.

84

If I could beg you to put
a good face upon the matter.

168
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:18,602
A-Assume a cheerfulness
you may not feel.

169
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,268
- Why, sure. Of course.
- Thank you.

170
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:31,379
Miss Trowbridge, may I present
Mr. Robert Rainsford.

171
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:34,116
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do?

172
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,715
- How do you do?
- And her brother, Mr. Martin Trowbridge.

173
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,056
How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?

174
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:42,791
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?

175
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,958
Indeed we do.

176
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,628
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like
some hot coffee.

177
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:51,002
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Rainsford, please sit here.

178
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:53,564
[Speaking Russian]

179
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,576
Vodka, that's the stuff!

180
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:58,112
One shot'll dry you out quicker
than all the coffee in Java.

181
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,978
Have to toss it off, though.
Like this.

182
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,450
Now, Martin, you don't have
to drink it all tonight, do you?

183
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,114
Don't be ridiculous, sis.
We are victims of circumstance.

184
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:09,157
Same as Mr. Rainsford.

185
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:11,887
And if anyone has a right to his liquor,
it's a victim of circumstance.

186
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:13,895
- Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.

187
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,898
- You were in a shipwreck too?
- Yes.

188
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,298
Our lifeboat
was the only one saved...

189
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,359
my brother and I
and two sailors.

190
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:24,998
The count found us on the beach with
nothing but the clothes on our backs.

191
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:27,372
Those channel lights
must have been shifted.

192
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:30,037
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report 'em...

193
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,239
just as soon as we get back
to the mainland.

194
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,839
You see, the count
has only one launch...

195
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,750
and that's under repair.

196
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,685
Russians are not
the best mechanics.

197
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,661
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient
a few days longer.

198
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,689
It's all right with me. I feel as if I
were living on borrowed time right now.

199
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,792
Speaking of that,
perhaps now you'll tell us...

200
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,803
a little bit
about who you are.

201
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:59,830
Just sketchily, you know...
born, married, why I left my last job.

202
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,934
No, no, no, no.
One moment, please.

203
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:06,107
Mr. Rainsford need never explain
who he is in my house.

204
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:09,015
We entertain a celebrity,
Miss Trowbridge.

205
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:11,712
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

206
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:17,124
- I know. Flagpole sitter.
- [Laughter]

207
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,560
- I know. He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.

208
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:23,928
If I am not mistaken,
this is Mr. Robert Rainsford...

209
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,229
who hunts big game
so adventurously.

210
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,894
Yeah? Here's to ya.

211
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,167
- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little."

212
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,040
No, I have read your books.
I read all books on hunting.

213
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,876
- A papiroso?
- Thank you.

214
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:42,145
Only in yours have I found
a sane point of view.

215
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,413
- What do you mean, "sane"?
- Cigarette?

216
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:47,922
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse.

217
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,924
Let me see.
How did you put it?

218
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:53,086
"Hunting is as much a game
as stud poker...

219
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,096
only the limits are higher."

220
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:59,225
- You have put our case perfectly.
- Then you're a hunter yourself?

221
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:04,204
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.

222
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:07,470
[Laughs] He sleeps all day
and hunts all night.

223
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:10,205
And what's more, Rainsford,
he'll have you doing the same thing.

224
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,839
We'll have capital sport together,
I hope.

225
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:14,849
Don't encourage him.

226
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,851
He's had our two sailors so busy...

227
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,410
chasing around the woods
after flora and fauna...

228
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,980
that we haven't
seen them for three days.

229
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,492
But what do you hunt here?

230
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:31,924
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.

231
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:34,697
I have done a rare thing.

232
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,204
I have invented
a new sensation.

233
00:18:37,273 --> 00:18:39,537
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.

234
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,337
What is this sensation, Count?

235
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,346
Mr. Rainsford,
God made some men poets.

236
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:48,872
Some He made kings,
some beggars.

237
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:50,885
Me, He made a hunter.

238
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:56,986
My hand was made for the trigger,
my father told me.

239
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,085
He was a very rich man...

240
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:03,723
with a quarter of a million acres
in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.

241
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,326
When I was only still up high
he gave me my first gun.

242
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:11,169
- Good for him.
- My life has been one glorious hunt.

243
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,437
It would be impossible for me to tell
you how many animals I have killed.

244
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,344
- But when the revolution...
- Look out.

245
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,144
[Speaking Russian]

246
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,616
Oh, I'm so sorry.

247
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,779
Count Zaroff
was so interesting...

248
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:29,153
I didn't realize the danger.

249
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,827
Oh, it's all right now. What were you
saying about the revolution, Count?

250
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:38,526
Oh, merely that I escaped
with most of my fortune.

251
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,468
Naturally, I continued to hunt
all over the world.

252
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,707
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo
gave me this.

253
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,709
[Rainsford]
That must have been a close call.

254
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:52,304
Yes. It still bothers me
sometimes.

255
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:56,044
However, in two months
I was on my way to the Amazon.

256
00:19:56,118 --> 00:20:00,145
I'd heard that the jaguars there
were unusually cunning.

257
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:03,282
No, no, no.
No sport at all.

258
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,487
Well, conditions
are bad everywhere these days.

259
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,895
One night, as I lay in my tent
with this...

260
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:12,058
this head of mine...

261
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:16,298
a terrible thought crept like a snake
into my brain.

262
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:19,535
Hunting was beginning
to bore me.

263
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:22,475
Is that such a terrible thought,
Count?

264
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:27,914
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has
been the whip for all other passions.

265
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,315
When I lost
my love of hunting...

266
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:35,119
I lost my love of life...
of love.

267
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,860
Well, you seem to have
stood it pretty well.

268
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,592
I even tried to sink myself
to the level of the savage.

269
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:49,296
I made myself perfect in the use
of the Tartar war bow.

270
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,566
Tartar which?

271
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,541
Tartar war bow...

272
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,544
That one up there.

273
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,975
It's cute.

274
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,644
Even to this day I prefer
to hunt with it...

275
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,654
but alas,
even that was too deadly.

276
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,623
What I needed
was not a new weapon...

277
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,084
but a new animal.

278
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,859
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.

279
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:19,332
You found one?

280
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:22,660
Yes.

281
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:26,572
Here on my island...

282
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:30,669
I hunt
the most dangerous game.

283
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:35,544
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?

284
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:38,085
Tigers?
[Chuckling] No.

285
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:43,984
The tiger has nothing
but his claws and his fangs.

286
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:49,625
I heard some queer beast howling back
there along the water. Was that it?

287
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:59,640
It's no use, Rainsford.

288
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,642
He won't tell.

289
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,440
He won't even let you see
his trophy room...

290
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:09,143
till he gets ready to take you
on a hunt of the great whatsit.

291
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:14,019
My one secret. I keep it
as a surprise for my guests...

292
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:16,387
against the rainy day
of boredom.

293
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,517
You let me in on that game...

294
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:21,154
and I'll bet you
I go for it.

295
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,926
You know, Rainsford,
he hasn't failed yet.

296
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,900
If he says a thing is good,
it is good.

297
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,938
He's a judge of liquor,
wizard at contract...

298
00:22:30,005 --> 00:22:32,701
plays the piano...
anything you want.

299
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:36,210
He's a good host
and a good scholar, eh, Count?

300
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:37,472
Yes, yes.

301
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:41,209
You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals.

302
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,116
We'll have a big party,
get cockeyed and go hunting.

303
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:46,120
A completely civilized
point of view.

304
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:50,682
I tell you what you do. You come
to my place in the Adirondacks, see.

305
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,059
We'll have a private car,
liquor and gals on the trip...

306
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,655
and the guides
will make the deers behave.

307
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,667
[Laughing]

308
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:02,203
I think we'd better
change the subject.

309
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:05,069
All right.
Change the subject.

310
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,438
Oh, I know!
Play the piano, huh?

311
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:09,773
If you wish.

312
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:13,804
Good idea. Play the piano.
Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.

313
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:16,942
Perhaps the count
doesn't want to play.

314
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,317
There you go, sis,
throwing cold water.

315
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,653
Leave me alone.
I know where the piano is.

316
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:25,284
- I'm perfectly sober.
- [Chuckles]

317
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
Charming simplicity.

318
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,763
"Completely civilized,"
did you say?

319
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:33,426
He talks of wine and women
as a prelude to the hunt.

320
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:35,868
We barbarians know
that it is after the chase...

321
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:39,135
and then only
that man revels.

322
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,141
It does seem a bit
like cocktails before breakfast.

323
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:44,474
Of course, yes. You know the saying
of the Ugandi chieftains...

324
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,606
"Hunt first the enemy,
then the woman."

325
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,617
That's the savages' idea
everywhere.

326
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,846
It is the natural instinct.

327
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,447
What is woman...
even such a woman as this...

328
00:23:55,524 --> 00:23:59,290
until the blood is quickened
by the kill?

329
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:02,159
- Oh, I don't know.
- "Oh, I don't know."

330
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,790
[Chuckles]
You Americans.

331
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:07,630

Come on, Count.
Now, you show them.

- What do you suggest?
- Oh, just a good tune.

It isn't true about the launch

I heard it leave the boathouse
last night. It returned this morning.

349
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:15,695
You mean he's keeping you
from returning to the mainland?

350
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,705
Yes.

351
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:22,335
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company
of two very charming people.

352
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:25,869
Two, maybe.
There were four of us a week ago.

353
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:30,043
- The other two have disappeared.
- What do you mean?

354
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:32,052
One night after dinner,
the count took one of our sailors...

355
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,146
down to see his trophy room...

356

- Yes.

358
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,895
Two nights later
he took the other there.

359
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:46,695
Neither has been seen since.

360
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:48,702
Have you asked him
about them?

361
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,761
He says they've gone hunting.

He's watching us.

It was splendid.
Don't stop, please.

I guess I'll have to go.

[Chuckling] Yes. My dear fellow,
I intended to tell you last night...

465
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,381
but you know, Miss Trowbridge...

466
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:58,118
You hunted him like an animal.

467
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,252
I know what you think,
but you are wrong.

468
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:03,491
He was sober and fit for sport
when I sent him out.

469
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:06,591
An hour or two strapped up in here
brought him to his senses.

470
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:09,159
You raving maniac!

when we've finished.

The stupid fellow tried to escape
through the swamps of Fog Hollow.

473
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,572
You see, when I first began
stocking my island...

474
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,378
many of my guests
thought I was joking...

475
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,318
so I established
this trophy room.

476
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:29,584
I always bring them here
before the hunt.

477
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,125
An hour with my trophies...

478
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,889
and they usually do their best
to keep away from me.

479
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:37,796
Where do you get
these poor devils?

480
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:42,768
Providence provided my island
with dangerous reefs.

481
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:45,305
But there are light buoys
to mark the safe channel.

482
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:49,901
[Chuckles]
They do not always mark it.

483
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:52,446
- You shifted them.
- Precisely right.

should have suffered...

it brought us together.

00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,752
You take half-drowned men
from ships you've wrecked...

487
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,755
and drive them out
to be hunted.

488
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:04,348
I give them
every consideration...

489
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:06,689
good food, exercise...

490
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:09,252
everything to get them
in splendid shape.

491
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,595
- To be shot down in cold blood.
- Oh, no, no.

492
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,158
Oh, I admit,
with this annoying fellow...

493
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:18,433
but usually I give them
hunting clothes...

494
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:21,703
a woodsman's knife
and a full day's start.

495
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:26,008
I even wait until midnight to give them
the full advantage the dark.

496
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,708
And if one eludes me
only till sunrise...

497
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,251
he wins the game.

498
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,121
Suppose he refuses
to be hunted.

499
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:39,989
Ivan is such an artist
with these.

500
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:46,999
Invariably, Mr. Rainsford,
invariably they choose to hunt.

501
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:49,002
And when they win?

502
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:57,305

this game worth playing.

504

we'll have gorgeous sport together.

505
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:08,054
You murdering rat!
I'm a hunter not an assassin.

506
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:11,455
Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me.

507
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,694

508
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:18,391

511
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,969

follow his own convictions...

512
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:35,072
to their logical conclusion.

513
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:38,915
I'm afraid in this instance,
Mr. Rainsford...

514
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:41,420
you may have to follow them.

515
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:45,452
What do you mean?

516
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:48,893
I shall not wait
for the next ship.

517
00:36:49,997 --> 00:36:53,660

Bob! Bob, what are they
going to do?

526
00:37:45,686 --> 00:37:48,280
- I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.

freedom for both of you.

538
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:26,684
- I'm going with you.
- No. He'll kill you too.

539
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:30,253
Not at all.
One does not kill a female animal.

540
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,993

I can easily recapture her alive.

541
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:35,365
All right.
I'll take her with me then.

542
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,234

543

- We will.

547

548

we've come miles.

doesn't take you far in this jungle.

551
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,654

552
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,097

then easy downhill going.

554

What are we going to do?

559
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:57,440
We didn't each live through a shipwreck
to let this crazy man hunter worry us.

560
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:01,072
I shouldn't have come with you.
You might beat him if you were alone.

561
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:04,345
Alone? And leave you here
with that savage?

562
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,352
Not a chance.

563
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:11,291
Now we've got to think
of something to worry him.

564
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,328
You'd never get near him.
He'd shoot on sight.

565
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:16,955
Weapons aren't everything
in the jungle.

566
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:20,865
Say, did you notice
that leaning tree down there?

567
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:24,393
- The one we just passed?
- Yes. I want to show you something.

568
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,670
You see? If that supporting branch
were cut away...

569
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:34,010
this fallen tree would make a perfect
Malay deadfall.

570
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:36,015
A Malay deadfall? What's that?

571

the natives use.

572
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,679
It would stop that madman,
all right.

573
00:41:40,755 --> 00:41:42,848
Trouble is, it takes
quite a few hours to build.

574
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,857
He said he wouldn't follow
till midnight.

575
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:48,088
That's right. If you help me,
I think we'll have time.

576
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:50,426
Come on.
We'll cut some strong vines.

to get by one yet.

You touch that trip line...

585
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:20,118
it'll pull that trigger free.

586
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:23,459
Once that's loose, there's nothing
to keep the log from coming down.

587
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:26,227
It'll crash down
and kill anything underneath it.

588

589
00:42:37,078 --> 00:42:39,273

But surely you don't think
that anyone who has hunted leopards...

597
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:15,364
would follow you
into that ambush?

as he'd hunt a leopard.

606
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,923
That means he's gone
for his high-powered rifle.

Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!
