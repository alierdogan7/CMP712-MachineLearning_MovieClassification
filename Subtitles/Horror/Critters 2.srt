1
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,992
I hate that part.

2
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:47,965
Bounty hunters, have you
completed your mission?

3
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,409
Oh, yeah, we wasted him.

4
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:51,704
Check out the head
on this sucker.

5
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:55,114
Fine, however, an earlier
expedition remains incomplete.

6
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,428
A G-sweep of the planet Earth
indicates residual Crite life.

7
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,389
- G-sweep's wrong.
- No way, Your Holiness...

8
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,757
I was there.
I saw it all.

9
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,489
The G-sweep is
infallible.

10
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,532
The council is very nervous
when it comes to the Crites.

11
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,698
They are a lethal plague
and must be wiped out.

12
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:15,067
Pay for the Hexapod kill
shall be withheld

13
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:18,301
until the eradication
of Crites on Earth is verified.

14
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,570
There must be no doubt.

15
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,544
Does this mean
we're going back to Earth?

16
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,077
What takes you
to Grover's Bend, son?

17
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:02,879
My grandmother
lives there.

18
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,112
Oh, Easter vacation
with Granny, huh?

19
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,144
That's
a good grandson.

20
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,657
You know what the Bend's
famous for, don't you?

21
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,319
What's that?

22
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:19,595
Hasn't your granny ever told you
about those space porcupine things?

23
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:23,093
No. No, she never did.

24
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:25,571
Bunch of folks hereabout
think they came

25
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:28,803
from one of those unidentified
flying UFOs or some such.

26
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:31,403
Some say those
little boogers attacked

27
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:34,762
one of the farms
outside of town.

28
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,076
Maybe a friend
of your granny's, huh?

29
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,584
The Browns.

30
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:42,453
No... no, no.
She doesn't know any Browns.

31
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:05,478
Come on, man!

32
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,572
Buried treasure
right this way.

33
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,877
What the hell
are we doing?

34
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,081
Ain't nobody lived here
in two years.

35
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,354
What exactly
are we looking for?

36
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:24,523
Collector's items.
Nothing like them.

37
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:27,829
Just like all the other weird shit
you got in your store.

38
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:31,600
Jeez, it's freezing
in here.

39
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,330
What are they?

40
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,946
Whatever you tell people
they are.

41
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:48,245
So what do you say?

42
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:52,548
These things
ain't worth dick!

43
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,124
Okay, fine.

44
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:58,062
I'll just take 'em
up to K.C.

45
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,158
See what one of them big antique
stores'll give me for them.

46
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,726
- You do that.
- But...

47
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:07,540
a case of Meister Brau would
save me a lot of trouble.

48
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:13,005
- Load 'em up.
- Right!

49
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:04,452
Perfect fit!

50
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,896
Come on, kids,
let's go. Hurry up.

51
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,901
Hey, Sis, dinner's
at 6:00, okay?

52
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,597
'Kay, Megan!

53
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,435
- You put...
- No, no, no.

54
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:20,537
Okay, okay. We'll pull the photo
one column to the left.

55
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,174
Now we'll keep
the 4H Club sidebar,

56
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:27,083
and we will swap
the sidewalk weeds issue

57
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,917
with the Easter egg hunt
right here!

58
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:32,424
- l-l...
- Yeah.

59
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,325
- Hey, Dad!
- Hi, honey!

60
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,592
- I got the returns.
- Just put them back by the...

61
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:40,758
- the typeset, will you?
- Okay.

62
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,791
What do we do about
the 39-pound squash?

63
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:46,304
We bury it somewhere
on page four.

64
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:50,839
- Didn't you say it was 29 pounds?
- 39.

65
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,572
I weighed
ol' jumbo myself.

66
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:57,079
Better move it
up to page one.

67
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:06,950
We're still looking
at empty space here.

68
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,983
Put that back!

69
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,292
I got a stop-press
story for you.

70
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:18,098
What's that?

71
00:09:18,136 --> 00:09:20,367
"Bus driver
finds Grover's Bend"?

72
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:24,068
"Brad Brown is
back in town."

73
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,871
Bradley Brown?!

74
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:27,878
The boy who cried
'critter.'

75
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:30,643
We don't want to get scooped
on this one, Mr. Morgan.

76
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:33,777
Not much chance of that, Sal.
We're the only paper in 80 miles.

77
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,446
This is big news
in Grover's Bend.

78
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:39,192
Inquiring minds
want to know!

79
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:40,586
- Like mine.
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,619
Just forget it, Sal. That boy's
stories nearly tore this town apart.

81
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:46,994
Just let Grover's Bend
forget about that night.

82
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:50,125
I mean it, Sal, no...
Brad Brown.

83
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:52,759
Brad who?

84
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:17,226
Snacktime!
Here we are!

85
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:21,425
Don't you have
any Clark Bars or Milk Duds?

86
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,833
Honey, fresh vegetables
are high in fiber,

87
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:28,066
and we need fiber
for a healthy B.M.

88
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:31,514
We don't want to get
constipated, do we?

89
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:34,034
- No!
- No, we don't.

90
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,714
I know who that is!

91
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:47,572
Bradley, come on in.

92
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,192
- Hi, Nana.
- Look at you...

93
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:51,320
you're shooting up
like a stinkweed.

94
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,490
You've been
eating red meat.

95
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,729
No! No, no, no.
Not me.

96
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,068
It's the worst thing
you could do to that body.

97
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:05,234
Come in here and have
a good snack with these kids.

98
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:08,040
You know the carnivores
have short intestines

99
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,171
and the meat passes
right out through?

100
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,078
But we're herbivores,

101
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,276
we've got great
long intestines

102
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:16,309
and the meat
just rots in there.

103
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:17,651
No, no, you stop it.

104
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,581
Quigley, get your stupid dog
out of the way.

105
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,442
Chili Dog,
get in the back.

106
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,785
Go on, get back.
Go on.

107
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,120
Get in the back.

108
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:56,125
Get in the back
you miserable son of a bitch!

109
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,888
Go on!

110
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:01,159
- It's just a dog.
- So was "Cujo."

111
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,038
Shit.

112
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,463
Hi, Harv.

113
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,738
What in the hell
are you doing here?

114
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:51,539
Important business.
Brad Brown is back in town.

115
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,778
Oh... well,
on the important chart

116
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,377
I'd put that right
between a pineapple quiche

117
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:59,011
and a pimple
on the ass.

118
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,922
I thought you'd want to talk with
him... about the critters and all.

119
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,792
Why in the hell would I want
to do a thing like that?

120
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,347
If I never talk
to anybody

121
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:09,930
about them things
that shall remain nameless,

122
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,161
I'll die a happy man...
and besides that,

123
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:16,035
I ain't been sheriff of this burg
for two glorious years.

124
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,439
Why don't you
run along home, Sal,

125
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:22,774
because they're about
to start the bonus round.

126
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,543
Here's the last of them.

127
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:34,055
Put them with the rest
of them, brain dead.

128
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,893
So... what about
them brewskies?

129
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,170
This is all that
plain-wrap piss.

130
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,234
I thought we agreed
on Meister Brau.

131
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,270
I ain't got
no Meister Brau.

132
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:01,748
Then I'm taking two.

133
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:06,721
And a couple of these!

134
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,961
I hate teenagers.

135
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,298
Quigley!

136
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:28,832
Now... what in the hell
am I gonna do with you?

137
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,620
...Right onto highway 54,
just outside of Grover's Bend.

138
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,449
We'd love to see ya.

139
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:42,064
- Moo-ve.
- # At the Hungry Heifer #

140
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:44,224
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

141
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,694
Say...

142
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:53,030
how come...

143
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,501
you look like
that rock and roll guy,

144
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,027
and Lee's still a...

145
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,697
nothing-face?

146
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:02,269
Because this body fit.

147
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,938
Lee stays
a nothing-face

148
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,413
till he finds
the right self.

149
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,814
Can't live
in the wrong self.

150
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,286
Charlie quiet.

151
00:15:20,762 --> 00:15:24,387
- Charlie thinking.
- Thinking what?

152
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,126
just about going back to Earth
after all this time.

153
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:31,798
Don't want to?

154
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,874
I don't know.

155
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:38,877
On Earth, I was
just a big nobody.

156
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:41,404
I had one friend...

157
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:43,246
and he was
just a kid.

158
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:45,479
- Brad.
- Yeah.

159
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:49,522
Hey, hey, uh...

160
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:52,081
you wouldn't just leave me
on Earth, would you?

161
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:56,123
Charlie bounty hunter.

162
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,955
Yeah...

163
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,900
yeah, Charlie
bounty hunter.

164
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:07,136
You guys are okay,
you know that?

165
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,876
# At the Hungry Heifer #

166
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:19,409
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

167
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,444
How about some buffalo chips
or a Moo shake?

168
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:23,683
We've got a two-for-one
Easter special.

169
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,816
No, thanks.

170
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,328
Wesley.
What are you doing here?

171
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,227
Let's have us
a beer.

172
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:32,993
Don't you get it?

173
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:37,856
Let's just say
I'm not the Van Halen type.

174
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,833
All right!

175
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,058
I hate elevator
music too.

176
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,175
Look...

177
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,678
what other choice
you got?

178
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,472
Wesley, I've got to go
to work! Leave me alone!

179
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,485
Leave her alone.

180
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:58,741
Just, you know...
cool it, okay?

181
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,117
Well, looky here.

182
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,353
Little Bradley Brown.

183
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,463
I haven't seen you
in a long time, peewee.

184
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:10,993
How's your little
space monsters?

185
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:13,850
I don't want to start
any trouble, okay, Wesley?

186
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,737
Did you hear that?

187
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,903
The little mouse
don't want any trouble.

188
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,844
Well, that's too bad.

189
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:28,353
I'm warning you,
I've been taking karate.

190
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:30,220
I don't want anyone
getting hurt,

191
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:31,589
so just keep
your distance.

192
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:37,253
Somebody call the sheriff!

193
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,122
Shouldn't have
come back, asshole!

194
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:48,635
Nobody wants you here!

195
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:51,566
Thanks for
the getaway. I'm...

196
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,408
Bradley Brown.

197
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:56,539
Do I know you?
Did we go to school together?

198
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,743
You used to throw cherry bombs
in the trash cans.

199
00:17:58,784 --> 00:18:00,514
Are you a senior?

200
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:02,043
Yup.

201
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:08,118
- What?
- Ponytail and braces.

202
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,789
- And zits.
- You're Megan Morgan?!

203
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,557
Does your dad still run
the newspaper?

204
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,263
I'm a reporter there.

205
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,634
Really?!

206
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:21,538
Kinda like a "Jimmy Olsen"
with breasts.

207
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:34,115
Chili, chow!

208
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:40,421
Well, shit.

209
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:47,442
I reckon you'll come back
when you get hungry.

210
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,470
But I'm going home.

211
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,644
Mr. Quigley? Len?!

212
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,622
Are you here?

213
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,923
Nana, it's scary
in here.

214
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,019
It's okay, hon.

215
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,788
Nothing here
can hurt you.

216
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:24,190
Especially no dead frog.

217
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:26,635
- Don't touch that!
- I didn't hurt it!

218
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,639
Never mind that, Len.

219
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:31,733
Where are those Easter eggs
you called me about?

220
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,835
Oh, they're
in the back.

221
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:45,348
Where on Earth
did you get these, Len?!

222
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:50,692
They're from Europe.

223
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:55,155
What are you
asking for these?

224
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:57,326
Uh...

225
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:58,835
10 bucks... each.

226
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:03,268
That's not what you'd ask
the church, now, is it?

227
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:05,366
Oh, of course not.

228
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,672
Of course not!

229
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,150
I'll give you $20
for the stack.

230
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,180
You can have
half for $25.

231
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:14,275
- 20.
- For half.

232
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:21,382
These really are
special, aren't they?

233
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:23,986
Yeah, really.

234
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:39,208
- How long are you in town?
- Just through Easter vacation.

235
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,802
- Where do you guys live now?
- Up in Kansas City.

236
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,780
KC, K or KC, MO?

237
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:47,340
This isn't for
"The Gazette," is it?

238
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:50,547
I'm thinking of going to college
there next year, okay?

239
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:54,902
Sorry, I just get nervous
with reporters and stuff.

240
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,383
'Cause of all that talk
about those...

241
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,923
space monsters
a couple years ago?

242
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,594
No such thing
as any "space monsters."

243
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:05,430
Really?

244
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,565
Yeah, that was just a stupid kid's
dumb dream. It never happened.

245
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,499
Oh, thanks for
helping me, honey.

246
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:39,991
And for being such a good girl,
I've got a present for you.

247
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:42,196
- What?
- Just wait.

248
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,769
Wow, a chocolate bunny!

249
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,780
It's better than chocolate,
honey, it's carob!

250
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:54,507
You might as well
take one of these too.

251
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:59,409
- Thanks, Nana.
- Happy Easter, darling.

252
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,091
Shit.

253
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,496
Easter sucks.

254
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,146
Jeez-oh-peese.

255
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,369
What the...?

256
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:15,760
Chili Dog?

257
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:18,761
Chili, boy.

258
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,796
Chili?

259
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,697
Chili, wake up, boy.

260
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:05,778
Looks like someone's
getting sleepy.

261
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,007
Not me!

262
00:24:07,048 --> 00:24:09,381
Go on. You want to be
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

263
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,750
for the big Easter egg hunt
tomorrow morning.

264
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:14,443
But I'm not
sleepy yet, Daddy.

265
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:15,586
- Really!
- Uh-huh.

266
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,489
Come on,
I'll tuck you in.

267
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,618
Okay...

268
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,288
"Okay..."

269
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,389
- 'Night, brat.
- 'Night, creep.

270
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,641
Super daughter.

271
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,602
- Want to get under the covers?
- No, it's too hot.

272
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:40,944
Oh, okay. 'Night, night,
sleep tight.

273
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,813
Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

274
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,140
I'll just bite it
right back!

275
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,681
Yeah. Oh...
uh-oh!

276
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:48,813
What's that
in your hair?

277
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,120
'Night, Daddy,
I love you.

278
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:52,387
I love you, too.

279
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:13,203
I'm going to bed now,
Bradley.

280
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,111
Don't stay up
too late.

281
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:44,706
You knew no one
would believe it.

282
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:46,610
Didn't you?

283
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:51,149
I sure do
miss you, Charlie.

284
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,984
Where did you go?

285
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,518
Honey, are you all right?

286
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,453
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

287
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,193
- Your Easter candy's a real mess.
- Ewww...

288
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,360
Would you look at this?

289
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,592
You ladies are doing
a wonderful job.

290
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,158
Now, Reverend!

291
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,533
Those are
for the children.

292
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,371
The Easter
Bunny's here.

293
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:30,540
Right on time.

294
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,601
Midge, would you bring
the sheriff his package?

295
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,011
- Here you go.
- There you are.

296
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,948
Are you sure you couldn't get
somebody else to do this?

297
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,611
Sheriff Harv did it
for 20 years running.

298
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,834
Well, I ain't
Sheriff Harv!

299
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:46,223
Don't be
such a gloomy Gus.

300
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,521
Sheriff, just help us out.

301
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,859
Who knows, you might even
have yourself a good time.

302
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,023
Fat chance.

303
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,625
Well, you better
hurry, ladies.

304
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,535
- Resurrection's in 45 minutes.
- Oh!

305
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,228
- Put this down on the other side.
- Okay, Emily.

306
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,667
Spread them out
so they're all even.

307
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,396
Good morning,
children.

308
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,261
Happy Easter.

309
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,289
We're going to have
to be patient today.

310
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:33,342
We can't start the hunt
until the services are over.

311
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:36,399
I have it on good authority
that the Easter Bunny himself

312
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,375
just might make
an appearance.

313
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,707
Go on now!

314
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,424
Thank you.

315
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,364
Boy, pretty good
crowd today.

316
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:10,191
I haven't seen you
since Christmas.

317
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,911
- I thought he was gone!
- He's trouble.

318
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:19,784
...back here.
- That's him.

319
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,552
Brad!

320
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:26,556
Welcome, friends.

321
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,615
Welcome one and all.

322
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:33,526
Today, of course,
is the Day of Resurrection.

323
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:36,031
So it seems only fitting

324
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,899
that some of you
have chosen this day

325
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:42,149
to resurrect
your church-going habit.

326
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:50,705
Why'd I ever let her
talk me into this?

327
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,885
Honey, that's
awfully beautiful.

328
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:01,276
Aw, this is great.

329
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,877
The Easter Bunny with
his Tehachapi hanging out.

330
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:07,385
It'd give them kids
a real education.

331
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:32,778
What the hell was in you?

332
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,988
...and entering
into the sepulcher,

333
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,262
they saw, sitting
on the right side,

334
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,497
a young man...

335
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,700
clothed in a long,
white garment.

336
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:02,105
And they were
afrighted.

337
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,399
Come on, sweetheart,
let's go.

338
00:33:39,414 --> 00:33:40,813
There you are.

339
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:53,151
My dad just ran
your grandma home.

340
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,621
Are you okay?

341
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:56,892
Yeah, I'm all right.

342
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,430
What do you think
happened to the sheriff?

343
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:05,364
You heard 'em. It was probably
some kind of farm accident.

344
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:07,806
Farm accident?!
You saw him!

345
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:10,003
That was no
farm accident.

346
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:11,237
What are you
trying to say?

347
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:13,645
You were telling the truth
about those things.

348
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:16,514
- There are no such things!
- I don't believe you.

349
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:19,986
I mean, I do
believe you.

350
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:23,457
I mean, I believe what
you said a couple years ago.

351
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,856
Do me a favor and don't
do me any favors, okay?

352
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:29,364
Don't you think
we better go see Harv?

353
00:34:31,331 --> 00:34:33,162
Well, I'm going.

354
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,802
Megan...

355
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,252
Harv?!

356
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:04,458
We need you in town, something
awful's happened at the church.

357
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:06,489
What the hell are
you doing here, boy?

358
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:09,400
We think it might have
been those... creatures.

359
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:14,669
What creatures
would that be?

360
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,105
- It's true, Harv.
- You see 'em?

361
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:17,610
Not exactly, but l...

362
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:21,405
Then don't be bringing me grief!
You go tell the sheriff.

363
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,745
- The sheriff is dead!
- They got him up at the church.

364
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,082
His stomach
was eaten out.

365
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:32,421
Folks are saying it was some farm
machine accident, but it wasn't.

366
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:35,519
You have to come with us, Harv!
What are you doing?

367
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:37,996
What does it look like
I'm doing, Einstein?

368
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:40,124
I'm doing what
any intelligent,

369
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:43,531
God-fearing
Grover Benders would do!

370
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,562
I'm haulin' ass!

371
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:47,420
You can't leave now!
This town needs you!

372
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:51,806
Yeah? This town
voted me out in a landslide.

373
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:54,643
This town can
kiss my ass!

374
00:35:57,384 --> 00:36:00,045
I can't believe you're
just going to run away.

375
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:03,452
We need you, Harv.
We need a sheriff.

376
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:06,186
Go check the yellow pages.

377
00:37:11,257 --> 00:37:13,122
hi...

378
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,888
this here's
American culture.

379
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,622
Good reading.

380
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:18,323
G-Good articles.

381
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:20,490
Transform.

382
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:27,466
Oh no, Lee.

383
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,497
No, no, Lee.
Don't look at me, Lee!

384
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,548
Kill Crites.

385
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,824
Hey, guys!
Hey, wait up!

386
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,954
Hey, Lee!

387
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:30,724
Lee, you're gonna
need this!

388
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,970
Okay, let's think about this. Maybe
there is a logical explanation.

389
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:40,307
What do you mean?
Like really bad stomach ulcers?

390
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,108
It could have
been a dog!

391
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:45,014
Yeah, and it could have been
the brain from Planet Eros.

392
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:47,176
You saw him, Brad.
It was no dog.

393
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,114
What's the matter?

394
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:55,718
I need a little air. I was going
home to take a hot bath and I see...

395
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,228
- Slow down.
- Rolling, rolling, towards me...

396
00:38:58,262 --> 00:39:00,629
- It's getting bigger and bigger...
- Take a breath!

397
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:02,291
And it's got
these big teeth...

398
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:05,032
- Where did it go?!
- Into Quigley's.

399
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:07,135
- Mr. Quigley!
- Get in the truck. Lock the doors.

400
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:08,833
You can't go.
Let's get help!

401
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,364
Who are we gonna call?
Critter Busters?

402
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,137
Just stay behind me
in the truck!

403
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:45,534
Mr. Quigley?

404
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,142
Anybody home?

405
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:52,709
Mr. Quigley,
are you okay?

406
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,648
Nobody's home.
Let's get out of here.

407
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:05,351
Get up!

408
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:07,420
Bradley,
look behind you!

409
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,194
Get in the truck!

410
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:12,224
Get in!

411
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,631
- Roll up the window!
- It's broken!

412
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:19,141
- Come on!
- God damn it!

413
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:21,872
Come on, come on!

414
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:24,142
- You're flooding it!
- Then you drive!

415
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:28,847
Dear God,
that critter thing!

416
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,520
Get away,
I am not kidding!

417
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,618
Yuck, veggies, ugh!

418
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,756
Nana, the critters
are here.

419
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,893
No, shit, Bradley!

420
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:22,427
Damn meat eaters!

421
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,904
Where are you going?
Bradley!

422
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:38,850
- Where's the communicator?
- What communicator?

423
00:41:38,888 --> 00:41:41,049
The one the bounty hunters
gave to me.

424
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,058
Bounty hunters?!

425
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:46,713
- The space guys.
- Oh, you mean the remote control.

426
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:48,329
- It's always on the TV.
- Not the remote control.

427
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:50,627
Nana, this is not
the remote control.

428
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:21,328
Those bounty hunters!

429
00:42:21,363 --> 00:42:23,979
That was fast.

430
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:27,162
- More Crites.
- Yeah, a lot more.

431
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:29,670
Boy am I glad
to see you.

432
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:32,505
B-both of you.

433
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,974
These guys are great.

434
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:47,659
Charlie!

435
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:50,818
Brad.

436
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,593
I can't believe it!

437
00:42:57,147 --> 00:42:58,963
Look at you... all dressed up
like one of them.

438
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,455
Well, I am one of them.
I'm a bounty hunter.

439
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:03,733
Yeah, right.

440
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,603
No, no, no.
I work with them.

441
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,473
Are you still...?

442
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:13,244
I don't need that anymore.
See... see...

443
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:15,249
up in space,
I am somebody.

444
00:43:15,283 --> 00:43:17,376
See, I got a job
and a meaning.

445
00:43:20,422 --> 00:43:23,549
So I guess that means
you won't be staying long then.

446
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:27,886
Probably not.

447
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:31,661
B-but, see, Brad...

448
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:33,692
I gotta go where
the cosmic winds blow me.

449
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:37,104
I gotta...

450
00:43:37,138 --> 00:43:38,867
go...

451
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:41,341
where no man
has gone before.

452
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,104
Well, it's really good
to have you back, Charlie.

453
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:50,273
Even if it's just
for a little while.

454
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,018
Hey, wait!
Help us out over here.

455
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:04,588
- That guy's crazy.
- Don't go in there.

456
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:14,697
# Hey, little buddies,
come gather 'round #

457
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:17,670
# This here's the very best
eating in town #

458
00:45:17,704 --> 00:45:20,171
# The Hungry Heifer's
the place to be #

459
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:22,801
# Lip-lickin' good,
you can take it from me #

460
00:45:22,842 --> 00:45:25,504
# Try a Polar Burger
and some buffalo chips #

461
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:28,207
# And wash it all down
with a Moo shake #

462
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:30,875
# Pat your tummy
and smack your lips #

463
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:34,615
# Suck for hours
on your fingertips #

464
00:45:34,654 --> 00:45:37,384
# At the Hungry Heifer #

465
00:45:37,424 --> 00:45:41,018
# We won't give you
a bum steer. #

466
00:46:57,036 --> 00:46:59,435
Get out of the way!

467
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:10,419
Operator?! Operator,
can you hear me? Please listen,

468
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,983
I can't hear you. This is
the editor of the "Gazette."

469
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:15,351
We need to get the highway
patrol here right away.

470
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:18,584
Operator, can you... oh, God.

471
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:24,862
Oh my God.
I can't hear you.

472
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:27,195
All I can hear is static.
If you're there...

473
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:30,360
can you hear me?
Can anybody out there hear me?

474
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:52,115
Daddy?

475
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,454
- Thank God!

476
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:59,429
- The critters are real.
- I know.

477
00:47:59,464 --> 00:48:01,591
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah.

478
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,064
Did you guys hear that?

479
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:07,332
Let's get to the door.

480
00:48:14,846 --> 00:48:17,245
- Oh no! Daddy!
- Get him up, come on!

481
00:48:18,483 --> 00:48:21,593
- Go!
- For God's sake!

482
00:48:22,353 --> 00:48:25,493
- Wesley!
- Wesley!

483
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:29,622
Chickenshit!

484
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:53,349
Go on inside. You'll be
much safer in there.

485
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:55,614
I need some more
bandages.

486
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:59,086
Daddy!

487
00:49:00,257 --> 00:49:03,091
- Cindy, are you okay?
- What happened to Daddy?

488
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:05,322
Don't worry,
he's gonna be all right.

489
00:49:15,939 --> 00:49:16,997
Shit!

490
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:32,679
Ug, what happened?

491
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:34,883
Crites feed
together.

492
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:36,620
Eat like a family.

493
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,686
Love meat.
A bad habit.

494
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,890
You guys
don't eat meat?!

495
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:44,161
Hey, who's gonna pay
for all this stuff?!

496
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:46,101
Look at the mess
you guys made!

497
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,072
No, Lee,
no, no, don't...

498
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,577
not this!
No, Lee!

499
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:15,593
Kill more Crites.

500
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:26,871
l-I gotta go, Brad.

501
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:29,103
Sorry.

502
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,930
It sure is quiet.

503
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:35,136
Maybe they're all dead.

504
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:37,338
I wish.

505
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,280
They're probably
waiting right outside.

506
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:45,386
There's a cheery thought.

507
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:50,218
It's like they're
teasing us or something.

508
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:54,862
I just wish I knew
where they were.

509
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:05,538
Lee?

510
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,677
Lee?

511
00:52:20,058 --> 00:52:22,656
Lee?!

512
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,093
What are you doing?

513
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:30,992
No! No, no, no!

514
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,624
No, Lee, please!

515
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:41,969
Hold it, Lee.
Hold on.

516
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,307
This is the one.
This... now, this...

517
00:52:44,346 --> 00:52:46,439
This... that's it.

518
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,380
Good, that's it.

519
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:53,750
Kill Crites.

520
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:56,887
Thank you.

521
00:54:08,628 --> 00:54:11,563
Sweet Jesus!
What was that?

522
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:19,496
Lee?

523
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,341
Ug, what happened?

524
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:26,573
Where's Lee?

525
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:06,080
Ug's losing it.

526
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:46,751
Charlie,
what happened?

527
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:48,761
Lee's dead.

528
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,695
What happened to...

529
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,050
Ug?

530
00:55:57,909 --> 00:56:00,068
Is he okay?

531
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:02,935
- He ain't breathing.
- He don't have a mouth.

532
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,881
Try and transform, Ug.

533
00:56:17,055 --> 00:56:18,989
Ug...

534
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,327
I'm not a good enough bounty hunter
to do it by myself.

535
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:10,800
Hey, get back inside!

536
00:57:10,842 --> 00:57:12,207
Go on!

537
00:57:15,013 --> 00:57:17,379
If you don't get inside
I'm going to see to it

538
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:19,177
your dad blisters
your little butt!

539
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:36,364
Get inside
and lock the door.

540
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,888
I'm back.

541
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:44,430
Cindy?

542
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,163
Cindy!

543
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:50,901
Looks like we got us
a job to do.

544
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:36,184
- Did you hear that?
- Uh-huh.

545
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:38,017
- What was it?

546
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,018
Look!

547
00:59:44,227 --> 00:59:46,128
Where are
they all going?

548
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:48,153
I don't know.

549
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:51,693
Looks like some kind of
critter convention.

550
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:10,514
There must be
hundreds of them.

551
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,922
We can't call
in the highway patrol.

552
01:00:19,962 --> 01:00:22,328
All the damn
phone lines are down.

553
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:25,265
We've got to do something.
We can't just stay here!

554
01:00:25,301 --> 01:00:28,395
Those things got the west road
out of town blocked.

555
01:00:28,437 --> 01:00:31,430
- We're never gonna get past them.
- Same goes for the east.

556
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:34,738
Listen, this is
the safest place we can be!

557
01:00:34,777 --> 01:00:37,610
Now, I say we stay here and wait
the little bastards out.

558
01:00:37,646 --> 01:00:40,411
- These things won't leave.
- Mind your own business, boy!

559
01:00:40,449 --> 01:00:43,129
This is my business!

560
01:00:42,384 --> 01:00:45,217
They don't give up! We have
to fight them and kill them.

561
01:00:45,254 --> 01:00:47,312
Seems mighty queer to me...

562
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,470
two years ago when
the critters first come,

563
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:51,387
they come
to the boy's house.

564
01:00:51,427 --> 01:00:54,021
The boy's back in town and
the damn things are here too!

565
01:00:54,063 --> 01:00:57,260
I've been through this before!
We have to fight these things!

566
01:00:57,299 --> 01:00:59,268
We don't include you.

567
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:03,102
Now, I ain't listening to no
undersized kid from the big city.

568
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,370
Or no town drunk!
Or no no-faced spaceman

569
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:10,106
out of a flying saucer telling us
how to run our own town!

570
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:12,842
We didn't have this trouble
till the boy came back.

571
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:16,283
Let's not get hysterical here. That
boy saved my little girl's life.

572
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:18,616
This ain't no show of yours
either, Morgan.

573
01:01:18,654 --> 01:01:20,952
I say the boy's
bad news in shoes.

574
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:31,430
What is this bullshit?

575
01:01:34,336 --> 01:01:37,794
Them man-eating dustmops
got us roped up tighter

576
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,364
than a blue-ribbon bull
and all you folks can do

577
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:44,037
is stand here and play
kick-the-can with some punk kid!

578
01:01:45,447 --> 01:01:48,211
If we set around here
on our duffs...

579
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,945
bitching...

580
01:01:49,985 --> 01:01:53,079
we're gonna end up
tomorrow's leftovers.

581
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:55,453
I don't too much
relish that idea.

582
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,924
I think it's time
to fight back.

583
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:03,260
- We gotta blow them up.
- Oh, come on, boy!

584
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:06,391
No, no, I mean it! Go out
in the field and see for yourselves.

585
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,731
The critters are eating
the cattle out there.

586
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,705
It's just like Ug said,
they get together to feed.

587
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,640
So let's put out the most outrageous
banquet in the world for them.

588
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:16,576
What have you
got in mind, son?

589
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:19,341
Polar Burgers! We'll get them
into the hamburger factory,

590
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,144
lock them in
and then blow them up!

591
01:02:21,182 --> 01:02:23,582
Who's gonna lead
this suicide mission?

592
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:32,956
Well...

593
01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:35,052
it was my idea.

594
01:02:35,095 --> 01:02:37,586
But I'm gonna
need some help.

595
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,037
Well...

596
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,171
I'm in.

597
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,709
I'll go.

598
01:02:53,347 --> 01:02:55,917
Really?!

599
01:02:57,652 --> 01:03:00,119
All right, you all
just volunteered.

600
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:02,679
Come on, you bunch
of pussies.

601
01:03:02,723 --> 01:03:06,750
You've got nothing
to lose but your lives.

602
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:50,428
I'll get the gate!

603
01:03:56,343 --> 01:03:58,037
Go!

604
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:03,306
Armed and dangerous,
everybody.

605
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,604
Oh my God!

606
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,610
It's working!

607
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:46,252
Let's roll.

608
01:05:56,574 --> 01:05:58,322
Oh my God.

609
01:05:58,364 --> 01:06:00,797
Harv, Harv!

610
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:05,231
Company's coming.

611
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,118
Wait up!

612
01:07:16,006 --> 01:07:17,906
Hey, don't piss
them off!

613
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:21,742
Keep your distance.
Stay downwind of them things.

614
01:07:53,911 --> 01:07:56,485
Everybody, ready?
Here they come.

615
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:17,491
Oh dear God.

616
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,573
Great.

617
01:08:35,618 --> 01:08:37,085
They stopped.

618
01:08:45,763 --> 01:08:47,821
Oh shit.

619
01:08:50,733 --> 01:08:52,758
Charlie, come back here!

620
01:08:53,836 --> 01:08:55,634
Charlie!

621
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:31,338
They're coming back.

622
01:09:50,325 --> 01:09:53,318
- Brad, I think it's gonna work.
- Shhh.

623
01:09:55,597 --> 01:09:57,792
Where did that
big one come from?

624
01:10:20,322 --> 01:10:22,187
Oh my God.

625
01:10:22,225 --> 01:10:24,444
Look at the size
of their leader.

626
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:43,611
Brad...

627
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:13,572
Ug.

628
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:16,168
It's the bounty hunter.
He led them back.

629
01:11:18,814 --> 01:11:20,543
The door!

630
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:34,956
Run! Blow it,
blow it!

631
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:12,992
We fried 'em!

632
01:12:16,106 --> 01:12:17,261
Are you okay?

633
01:12:17,304 --> 01:12:20,183
Yeah. It's just ketchup.

634
01:12:20,611 --> 01:12:21,670
Close one, though.

635
01:12:31,152 --> 01:12:33,383
Get back, she's gonna
blow again!

636
01:12:57,188 --> 01:12:58,275
Son of a bitch.

637
01:13:23,838 --> 01:13:26,305
Harv, it's heading
back to town.

638
01:13:26,339 --> 01:13:30,275
Ohhh, Lord, Harv,
the children!

639
01:13:30,311 --> 01:13:32,142
- Come on.
- Let's go!

640
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:52,230
Come on!

641
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,891
Come on, faster!

642
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:07,904
They're heading for town!
Come on!

643
01:14:11,017 --> 01:14:13,042
Oh my God, I bet it's headed
for the church.

644
01:14:13,086 --> 01:14:14,815
We gotta stop it!

645
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:30,334
Inside, quick.
Quickly!

646
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:32,773
Honey, do what he says.
Get inside.

647
01:14:35,774 --> 01:14:37,674
Brad, look out!

648
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,179
Ram it, ram it!

649
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,917
I'm gonna hit it!

650
01:15:12,177 --> 01:15:14,407
- Come on!
- Run, run!

651
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:24,355
Look!

652
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:29,019
I'm a bounty hunter!!

653
01:16:04,763 --> 01:16:06,855
Charlie...

654
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:10,427
You mean that...

655
01:16:10,468 --> 01:16:12,460
Charlie...?

656
01:16:33,624 --> 01:16:35,957
Good ol' Charlie.

657
01:16:48,506 --> 01:16:51,034
Brad, look at Ug.

658
01:17:23,074 --> 01:17:26,006
Well, just go
on in, huh?

659
01:17:25,443 --> 01:17:28,037
You practically got
the whole run of the bus.

660
01:17:33,484 --> 01:17:35,247
Goodbye, Brad.

661
01:17:36,386 --> 01:17:38,411
Goodbye, Charlie...

662
01:17:38,456 --> 01:17:39,423
I mean... Ug.

663
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:42,557
Charlie.

664
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:47,591
- Thanks, Nana. Love ya.
- I love you, too.

665
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,462
And here. Here's a...

666
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,678
spinach-cashew
cake I made.

667
01:17:52,032 --> 01:17:53,460
Eat it if you
get hungry.

668
01:17:53,607 --> 01:17:56,371
- Okay?
- Okay.

669
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:07,813
Get a move on, son,
this bus runs on a schedule.

670
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:12,245
I guess I'll be
seeing ya.

671
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:20,427
Come on, son. Kiss your little
gal and let's haul ass.

672
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:27,797
Holy shit!

673
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:35,010
Hey, can one of you guys help me
get this parachute off?

674
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:38,748
Charlie?

675
01:18:38,783 --> 01:18:41,080
Oh, I got it.

676
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,011
Charlie.

677
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,184
Hi.

678
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,938
Ug?

679
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,052
Charlie?

680
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,378
Say, listen...

681
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,130
what just
happened here?

682
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,933
If I was you, partner,

683
01:20:44,972 --> 01:20:47,167
I'd roll this rig
right outta town,

684
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:49,958
and not say nothin' about
none of this to nobody.

685
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,845
Bye, Megan.

686
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,408
Bye, Brad.

687
01:21:22,877 --> 01:21:25,607
Hey, Charlie!
Catch!

688
01:22:28,976 --> 01:22:32,643
# Hey, little buddies
come gather 'round #

689
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:34,742
# This here's the very best
eatin' in town #

690
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:37,273
# The Hungry Heifer's
the place to be #

691
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:40,082
# Lip-lickin' good,
you can take it from me #

692
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,680
# Try a Polar Burger
and some buffalo chips #

693
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:46,177
# Wash it all down
with a Moo shake #

694
01:22:45,558 --> 01:22:48,119
# You'll pat your tummy
and smack your lips #

695
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:51,619
# Suck for hours
on your fingertips #

696
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:54,531
# At the Hungry Heifer #

697
01:22:54,567 --> 01:22:58,937
# We won't give you
a bum steer... #

698
01:23:00,327 --> 01:23:02,235
And don't you forget,

699
01:23:02,569 --> 01:23:05,736
all of your friendly Hungry Heifer
restaurants throughout the Midwest

700
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:08,543
are open on Easter Sunday.
So after church,

701
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:11,949
why don't you and your family
stop in for a creamy Moo shake

702
01:23:11,985 --> 01:23:13,953
or some crispy
buffalo chips?
