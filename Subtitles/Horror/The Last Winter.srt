Alaska: vast wilderness of the North.</i>

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>Land of great natural
beauty and diversity.</i>

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>This is rugged country.</i>

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>Land of black gold.</i>

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>Alaska's north slope
has been producing oil</i>

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,920
<i>out of Prudhoe Bay since 1968,</i>

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,480
<i>delivering to refineries and ports
800 miles to the south</i>

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,440
<i>through the great
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.</i>

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,360
<i>But another northern region</i>

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,160
<i>known as the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge</i>

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,040
<i>has remained untapped.</i>

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
<i>Only once have prospectors
gained access</i>

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>to this barren landscape.</i>

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,360
<i>In 1986, the KIK Corporation,</i>

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
<i>a partnership between native
and business interests,</i>

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,200
<i>commissioned the drilling of a test well.</i>

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,560
<i>The results of that drilling</i>

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,480
<i>have been a carefully
guarded secret ever since,</i>

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,560
<i>with only a solitary white box</i>

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,520
<i>marking the footprint
where the rig once stood.</i>

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,280
<i>Now, at last, after
an historic vote in Congress,</i>

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,040
<i>the KIK well will reveal her secrets,</i>

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,080
<i>and North Industries will be there.</i>

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,920
<i>Working in consort
with environmental experts,</i>

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,680
<i>North Industries will send
advance teams to map the area</i>

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,400
<i>and determine strategic drilling locations.</i>

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,760
<i>Ice roads will be constructed
to transport the rigs,</i>

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,400
<i>and drill sites and pipelines</i>

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,080
<i>will be operational within the decade.</i>

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,120
<i>One step closer
to energy independence.</i>

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,760
<i>We have got the vision, the experience,</i>

32
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>the know-how.</i>

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,800
<i>North Industries.</i>

I could use a longer runway.

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
Sounds like a personal problem, Gary.

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,200
It's on my list. That's a for-sure.

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,640

- With you in it.

- How you doin'?
- A hundred percent, Abs.

61

<i>Okay. Put me down.

You're far too excitable.

[Abby]
Yeah, Lee. Pipe down.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
It is good to see this
team taking shape here.

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,720
Gary's taking off.
He wanted to beat the snow.

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,680
Aw. I wanted him to stay for a drink!

83
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,720
Mind your damn manners, Motor.

84

Hey, Dawn, where's those glasses?

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,080
<i>Oh. This is Elliot Taylor.</i>

86
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,960
He is doing the impact evaluations.

87
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,960
I thought the new green
flag was named Hoffman.

88
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,560
That's my boss.

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
They sent two guys?

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,760
This what you were looking for, Motor?

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,920
Mm-hmm.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
A little fish.

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Cigarettes.

94

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520

Hi.

105
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,440
James Hoffman, meet Ed Pollack.

106
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
How ya doing?

107
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm doing fine.

108
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,360
[wind, distant chatter]

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,960
[Ed]
Before your time.

110
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Listen up. This is what I want to say.

111
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,400
Now, I know you've...
all been in a holding pattern,

112
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,320
and I want to apologize for that.

113
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,480
These ice roads have been
a bitch to get in,

114
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,920
and Hoffman can give you
the reason for that.

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Uh, it's not cold enough.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hell, it feels cold as a witch's boob
out here to me.

117
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, you need a sustained sub-zero
to build those roads.

118
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,720
Well, then find me some sub-zero!

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,280
I mean, we're in fucking Alaska!

120
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,280
It's the Arctic Circle!
It's the dead of winter here!

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
Well, that's exactly the problem.

122
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,960
The temperature's
been all over the place.

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,080
So, um... how is it
that you come to work for North?

124
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,920
I mean... you're not the type.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,040
We don't work for North.

126
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
We work for the American people

127
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,920
to make sure that North
keeps its end of the bargain up here,

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,080
being on this land.

129
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,120
What the American people
want is energy independence.

130
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,440
That's what
the American people want.

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Hell, the amount of oil
that they're gonna get out of here

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,120
they could save by inflating their tires
and caulking their windows.

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
Hoffman knows all that crap.

134
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,520
He's an oil geek.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,240
He was at the Kuwaiti oil field fires.

136
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,440
Right? Uh, and Valdez?

137
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,120
<i>He was there
when the Titanic went down.</i>

138
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,320
[Hoffman]
This was a chance for me

139
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,120
to come to the last piece of pristine...
untouched wilderness on the planet

140
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,840
before we fuck it up.

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,000
So if North... is willing to pay me
to be here, then so be it.

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,720
[Motor]
Whoa.

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
Maxwell, you're on my team.

144
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
[Ed, chanting]

- Yeah?

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,240
<i>- You're gonna be my center over here!
- Okay. You got it.</i>

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Maxwell. I think we're
gonna call you "House" out here.

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
What do you think of that, Maxwell?

150
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,160
That's okay, Mr. Pollack.

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,360
- You can call me Ed. All right, House?
- Yes, sir.

152
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
When do I say "hike"?

153
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,400
You're gonna go to the right.
You're gonna go to the left.

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,880
- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!

155
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,000
Hut, hut, hut!

156
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,760
I don't even know the fucking rules.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,480

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,080
[Dawn] Go!

160
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
[Abby] Get him!

161
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
- [Ed] Yeah!
- [Others] Woo!

162
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
- Gimme some love, bro.
- Yeah!

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,400

166
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,760
It's all right.
He's down. He's down.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,640
[Ed]
Right here! We're here! All right, we're here.

168
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,520
Flag on the play.

169
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Get off me!

170
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,560
Hike!

171
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520

175
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah, baby!

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
What happened?

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,360

Yeah.

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,880

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,160
It put me right to sleep.

258
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,720
It's just... It's just
bad judgment on Abby's part,

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,880
you know what I'm saying?

260
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360

I don't know, man. Ask her.

267
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,720
Hand me that Allen wrench,
will you, boss?

268
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
How long?

269
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Three to four weeks.

270
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,560
It won't last. I'll tell you that much.

271
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,360

by the way.

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,360
I mean, North thinks
they can win a PR campaign,

278
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,760

the impact statements.

279

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,160
They can see the potential.

282
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,280
They don't need to get bogged down
with a lot of hand wringing.

283
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,680
He thinks there's something off-kilter
going on out here.

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,000
Is that what he's telling everybody?

285
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,400
Yeah, the permafrost is melting.

Something happening, Dawn.

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,480

That's brilliant! Do that again!

<i>Very Twilight Zone.</i>

565
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,480
Would either of you like
to comment on the fact

566
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,200
that it's fucking raining out,
February in the Arctic?

567
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,040
I'm freaking, man.

568
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,840
<i>- [Dawn] Uginaca.
- What's that, Dawn?</i>

569
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,840
Well, it means like a familiar friend
acting strangely.

570
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,560
It's how we speak of weather.

571
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,480
It gets worse every year.

572
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,520
[heart beating]

573
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,000

What's happening?

574
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,280
What do you say about it, Hoffman?

575
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,000
[Hoffman]
The climate's changing exponentially.

576
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,760
It's collapsing. It's altering.

577
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,760
[Motor]
I'm talking about right now,
today, what happened?

578
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,640
That's what I'm talking about, today.

579
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,000
It was rain.

580
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,320
For Christ's sake, the temperature's
already dropping back.

581
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,680
It was a fluke.

582
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
Well?

583
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,880
He's staring out the window.

584
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,080
He say anything?

585
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,200
No.

586
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,240
Did you tell him I said it was dinnertime?

587
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
Yep.

588
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,920
Send him home, Ed.

589
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That's what I say.

590
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,200
He's not going anywhere.

591
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,000
Well, if he doesn't eat, he can't work.

592
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,280
I realize... Jesus Christ.

593
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,680
Can I get a little fucking positivity here?

594
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,440
[scoffs]

595
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,240
And wipe your face.

596
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,400
You're pathetic.

597
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,840
You do realize that there are restrictions

598
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,960
on alcohol consumptions
at this station, don't you?

599
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,920
[laughing]

600
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,760
And what about you?
Would you pass a piss test?

601
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,480
And where do you think you're going?

602
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,120
Let him try, Ed.

603
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,160
Yeah. House likes him.

604
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,160
[knock on door]

605
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,600
May I come in?

606
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,000
[Maxwell]
Yeah.

607
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,960
I brought you this.

608
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,800
What happened out there yesterday?

609
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,200
When we lost you?

610
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,240
I don't know.

611
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,280
<i>Out by the KIK well...</i>

612
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,840
it's haunted.

613
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,520
All right. Just... take a deep breath

614
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,800
down on that one there, Maxwell.

615
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,440
We shouldn't be here.

616
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,000
We're grave robbers.

617
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,920
It's coming up from the ground.

618
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,920
Ghosts.

619
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,160
I mean, what is oil anyway but fossils?

620
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,680
Plants and animals from...

621
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,080
whatever... millions of years ago.

622
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,520
Listen. Maxwell.

623
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,720
That's...

624
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,080
Maybe...

625
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,680
this has gotten to be
a little too much for you.

626
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,520
It's pretty intense out here.

627
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,240
You can go home.

628
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,200
Have you thought of that?

629
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I can't.

630
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,760
My... my parents would kill me.

631
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,120
Your parents aren't going to kill you.

632
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,280
It was my father's
idea for me to be here.

633
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,160
Satisfy my love of the outdoors
by drilling for oil with Uncle Ed.

634
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,280
Well, maybe your father would listen
if you explained to him.

635
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,040
Have you thought about that?

636
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,960
Man...

637
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,160
eat some food.

638
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm telling you!
There's something out there

639
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,240
<i>- that's trying to drive us out of here!
- Okay...</i>

640
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
It's like a force, fighting back!

641
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,040
- Maxwell, you gotta...
- No! People need to know! Isn't that your job?

642
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,560
To let people know what the fuck
they're supposed to do here?

643
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,600
What the hell is going on?

644
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,200
- Tell them! Tell them what you know!
- Hey!

645
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,600
- Calm down! You, get the fuck out of here!
- You know what's happening!

646
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,320
You know! You've said things!

647
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,280
- You know what's going on...
- Calm down!

648
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,560
[Ed, softly]
You gonna calm the fuck down?

649
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,560
[door slams]

650
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,160
Yes, sir.

651
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,200
Just need...

652
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,200
I need to rest.

653
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,880
Sorry.

654
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,640
[wind blows]

655
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,160
[dripping water]

656
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,480
He's resting.

657
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,280
Dawn's got him on something.

658
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,000
What the hell was that in there?

659
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,920
I got Maxwell out here, you know.

660
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,440
Told his old man how good
it would be for him.

661
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,680
[sighs]

662
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Known that kid since the day he was born.

663
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,320
I know, Ed.

664
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,440
It's Hoffman!

665
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,520
I have no idea how you ended up in
the sack with that guy.

666
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,880
But I gotta tell ya,

667
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,280
I consider it a security breach.

668
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,760
We had nothing to hide, Ed.

669
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
Everything is by the book.

670
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,760
He works for North.

671
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,560
Every report he does goes through us.

672
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,600
I think you made a big mistake
transferring him out of here.

673
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,440
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him
or anybody else fuck this up for me!

674
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,000
I had his confidence.
I had my eye on him.

675
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,240
[deep sigh]

676
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,000
You let me down, Abby.

677
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,280
I did not, Ed.

678
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,160
I mean personally.

679
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,400
I guess that's over with.

680
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,960
Yeah, it is.

681
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,680
Good night.

682
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,880
Sure hope you don't like
the new guy as much.

683
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,800
- Who you got?
- Hmm.

684
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,960
Marshowitz.

685
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,480
[door closes]

686
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,520
Abby.

687
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,680
I'm tired.

688
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
Maxwell...

689
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,240
saw something out there.
Something's going on here.

690
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,760
- [unzipping]
- [sighs]

691
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,960
Don't think you need
to get involved with Maxwell.

692
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,920
We'll take care of him.

693
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,440
That sounds ominous.

694
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,120
You know, you're getting awfully vocal
about what we're doing up here.

695
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,920
It's not gonna work with Pollack.

696
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,880
You should've just signed
those impact reports.

697
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,120
Pollack has no idea
what's going on out here.

698
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,840
<i>- Oh, and you do?
- No, I don't, either.</i>

699
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,480
That's why I'd like to
take a giant step backwards

700
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,920
and get some people up here
who can figure out what is going on.

701
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,280
You know your deal with North prohibits you

702
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,640
from saying anything
about this to anyone.

703
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,000
What's that supposed to mean?

704
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Just need to make that clear.

705
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,680
Abby!

706
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,160
You don't feel that something is off here?

707
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
Listen, Abby.

708
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,320
You can make a real difference here.

709
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,160
Draw a line in the sand.

710
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,280
If they shut this project down,

711
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,680
the others could be called into question.

712
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,960
You could be part of
a change for the better.

713
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,920
Take your case to North, if you need to.

714
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,680
At this station, we're fighting
to get those rigs in.

715
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,840
Whatever it takes, and on schedule.

716
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,240
What's been going on with us
these last three weeks?

717
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,160
I gotta sleep.

718
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,480
[snoring]

719
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,040
[turns off camera, removes tape]

720
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,800
[Ed, snoring]

721
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,200
[snoring]

722
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,200
[wind howling]

723
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,720
[wind blowing]

724
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,800
[Ed]
This is on the fritz, too.

725
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,560
We gotta do something to get these systems
up and running, Motor.

726
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,080
I fix stuff around here.

727
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,840
Two hours later, it's broke again.

728
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,640
Maybe we need to get somebody
down here who could figure this shit out.

729
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,760
Hey. Look at this.

730
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,440
How's he doing?

731
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,800
What is this now?

732
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,000
[Motor]
There's my camera, man!

733
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,800
We should thaw the fucker out
and see if he shot anything with it.

734
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,520
[engine stops]

735
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,640
[wings fluttering]

God damn it!

739
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,320
Where was he?

740
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,160
[Lee]
Up by the KIK well.

741
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,600
You should have send him home, Ed.

742
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,840
You should have sent him the fuck home!

743
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,440
We'd better call and report this.

744
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,600
- Radio's dead.
- [Ed] We wait until morning!

745
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,760
Foster's flying in here with what's-his-name.

746
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,520
We get Maxwell flown out by Gary.

747
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,760
That's final!

748
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,200
<i>[Maxwell, recorded]
Ever since I got here,</i>

749
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,000
<i>I could tell that there
was something wrong.</i>

750
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,560
<i>Not the Job. Not the cold.
Not being isolated.</i>

751
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,560
<i>But feeling... how?</i>

752
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,960
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

753
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,840
<i>I've seen something out in the snow.</i>

754
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,680
<i>I want to show you.</i>

755
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,840
Jesus. What's he doing?

756
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,000
<i>[Maxwell, recorded] Do you see it?</i>

757
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,200
<i>Did you see it?</i>

758
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,520
<i>[shivering breath]
Did you see it?</i>

759
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,520
<i>[wind blows]</i>

760
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,880
<i>Up ahead. They're out now.</i>

761
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,920
<i>Listen! Listen! That!</i>

762
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,440
<i>- [wind, crackling]
- It...</i>

763
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,720
<i>Dad, do you hear that?</i>

764
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,360
<i>Listen!</i>

765
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,760
<i>[wind, crackling]</i>

766
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,360
<i>Do you see it, Dad?</i>

767
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,520
<i>They're out there!</i>

768
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,920
<i>They're right out there!</i>

769
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,720
<i>[shivering]
You see... you see that?</i>

770
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,640
<i>Do you see it? Do you see it?</i>

771
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,720
[gasps]

772
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,240
All right. That's it.

773
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,680
[tape ejects]

774
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,400
[Abby]
Ed...

775
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,440
Ed!

776
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,480
You can't burn that!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

777
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,480
Ed! Ed!

778
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,800
I'm in charge here!

779
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,280
And that tape does nobody any good!

780
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,000
Back off, Pollack!

781
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,280
You want his parents to see that?
Is that what you want?

782
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,360
Their kid whacked out?

783
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,120
Wandering around in his birthday suit?

784
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,120
You're out of your mind.
That was evidence, Pollack.

785
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,320
There'll be an investigation!

786
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,440
He wandered off,
and he died of exposure!

787
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,200
Did you hear what he was saying?

788
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,160
You're on the next plane outta here, Elliot!

789
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,600
You and Hoffman! Until then,
you stay out of my way!

790
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,840
We should all be on that plane, Ed.

791
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,440
And what did you put
in his head last night?

792
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
Elliott, your nose. Come on. Get inside.

793
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,160
Get inside.

794
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,760
Go, go, go, go, go. Come on.

795
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,000
[door slams]

00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,680
[Dawn]
What do you say, Lee?

797
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,080
<i>- [sigh]
- Is it the coming of the shinu?</i>

798
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,560
<i>Shinu?</i>

799
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,720
<i>A shinu is a dark spirit.</i>

800

What do you say, Lee?

803
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,240
I believe...

804
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
what I see with my own eyes.

805
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960

Motor.

811

What are you doing, man?

812
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,760
I have to check the engine.

813
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,320
Just... think... I think...

814
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,000
we might have to get out of here.

815
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,400
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.

816
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,720
- Listen, man. Listen.
- [groaning]

817
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,680
<i>It's cold out here. Okay?</i>

818
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,680
You should go inside, okay?

819
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,840
- Your hands...
- My hands are fine.

820
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,040
I'm... can hardly feel 'em.

821
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,920
You know what I'm thinking?

822
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,360
I'm thinking maybe you ought
to lay off the hooch just a little bit.

823
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,640
'Cause you're not
thinking so straight.

824
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,520
Look, I'm... I'm headin' down south.

825
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,960
After this winter, I'm...

826
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,040
I've had it. I'm outta here.

827
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,960
[howling wind]

828
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,160
I need to talk to you.

829
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,360
Can it wait?

830
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,960
No.

831
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,960
[glass bangs table]

832
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,040
Maxwell's father...

833
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,280
is a friend of mine.

834
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,280
I lost his kid on my watch.

835
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,040
I know. I'm sorry.

836
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,760
It wasn't your fault.

837
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,280
Well, I'm responsible.

838
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,320
For this crew, and everything
that happens to 'em.

839
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,360
Your sorry ass included.

840
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,920
Well, then do the responsible thing

841
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,760
and let's get everybody out of here tonight.

842
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,520
Why? 'Cause you say so?

843
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,760
Because it's not safe.

844
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,520
I think there's
an atmospheric abnormality here

845
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,600
that's affecting everyone's judgment.

846
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,000
I think that's what
happened to Maxwell.

847
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,320
Now Motor is out there
not making any sense, either.

848
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,920
- Don't you start any new shit.
- Look.

849
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,760
It's some sort of low-level sour gas.

850
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,080
It's seeping up out of the ground.

851
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,440
H2S is a half a mile
under the earth's surface.

852
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,120
It doesn't just seep
out of the ground, for Christ's sake.

853
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,280
Do you even know what the fuck
you're talking about?

854
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,800
I say it does. This
permafrost is melting.

855
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,920
Somehow, this hydrogen
sulfide's making its way to the surface

856
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,960
- like a low-level blowout.
- Bullshit!

857
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,840
All right, well.
Then it's some kind of contagion.

858
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,840
<i>Or a virus. Or spores.
I don't know! All right?</i>

859
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,240
I don't know.

860
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,800
But I do know that this
ground's been frozen

861
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,600
for the last 10,000 years.

862
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,040
We have no idea
what's coming out of it.

863
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,520
Do you even realize
you're putting everybody

864
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,840
at risk with this kind of talk?

865
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,680
[sighs]

866
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,360
Have another drink, Pollack.

867
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,600
Fuck you.

868
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,600
I got a series of alarmist ideas.

869
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,160
The warming is melting the tundra.

870
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,160
But then you are worried
about a whole sour gas scenario.

871
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,360
You haven't made yourself clear!

872
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,200
Well, it's a lot of factors.

873
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,440
<i>Okay? All at once.</i>

874
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
None of which I fully
understand at this point.

875
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,200
But I think that we should err
on the side of caution.

876
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,960
Well, I can't make a run for it
based on a hunch.

877
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,320
I need evidence.

878
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,200
There's a corpse outside.

879
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,600
That's evidence of something.

880
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,800
Yeah. That's evidence

881
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,120
of a major malfunction
on Maxwell's part.

882
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,280
Well, you should know that Motor
is now totally freaking out.

883
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,800
He's taking apart the Snowcat.

884
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,560
What?

885
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,600
Look, we're all under
a lot of pressure out here.

886
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,240

Abby has decided...

921
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,920
in light of recent goings-on

922
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,360
that we should all ship out of here,

923
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,000
and get our heads checked.

924
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,960
I'm gonna second that motion
for the good of the team.

925
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,320
But make no mistake.
We're coming right back.

926

We're just gonna go to Deadhorse.

927

We're gonna get checked out there
in the infirmary.

928

I want everybody's bags packed.

929

He'd go crazy without this job.

938

My bottom line is he's...
he's just not delivering.

Pollack! Pollack!

1073
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,440
What?

1074
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,120
We lost all our oil.

1075
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,160
She's not gonna start.

1076
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,600
Fuck!

1077
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,600
All right, Ed, listen.

1078
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,600
Fort Crow is 9 miles
south of here, maybe 10.

1079
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,600
We got three hours of daylight left.

1080

Let's cover him up.

1088
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:15,920
Pollack! You see that ridge?

1089
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,800
Fort Crow is on the other side.

That's it.

All right.
Hang on a second!

- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

1114

Yes, you can. Come on, Pollack.

Uhh!

1117
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,040
We gotta get off this ice.
It's not stable.

Come on. Come on.

1119

You're doing great.

1122
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,040
Come on, we gotta get this off.

1125
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,040
- Forget about the boot.
- I gotta go get my boot.

1126
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,520
No! Forget about the boot, Pollack!
The boot's gone.

1127
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,800
Boot's gone.

1128

We gotta get those clothes off you.

Atta boy.

Take it easy with that stuff.

1140
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,600
It doesn't mix well with hypothermia.

1141
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,600
[Ed]
We could die out here.

1142
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,760
That gonna be a boot?

1143
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,880
Yep.

1144
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,840
Anyway, I, uh...

Well, anyway...

She means a lot to me.

1152
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,440
I guess we had our go at it.

1153
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,080
She's a handful.

1154
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,640
Believe in God?

1155
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,720
No.

1156
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,880
Not the way you mean.

Jesus Christ, Jim.

1158
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,960
I would not do what you've
chosen to do up here.

1159

Whatever god it is that sanctions that,

1160
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,040
then no.

1161
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,400
I'm not a believer.

1162
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,920
What's needed out here is a pipeline

1163
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,960
and a base camp...

1164
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,600
and a couple of wells.

1165
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,400
