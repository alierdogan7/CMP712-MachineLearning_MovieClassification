1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,070
I am Obersturmfuhrer Rolf Kessel
from the SS.

2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,912
And this is one of my men.

3
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,073
We found him in a ditch
with a kitchen knife in his back.

4
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,397
Murdered by one of you.

5
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,277
You see the German army retreating,
and it makes you feel hope.

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,714
It should not.

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,715
So who is responsible for this?

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,671
You, priest.

9
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,191
What's your name?
I'm Father Merrin.

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,396
Father Merrin.
These people confess to you?

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,069
Yes.
So point out the one who is responsible.

12
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,231
No one here did this, lieutenant.

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,118
They aren't capable of it.

14
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,272
Father, you must help me with this.

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,829
Oh, but how?
Well, I need someone.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,752
Do you understand?

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,992
Surely there is one among them
who beats his wife or his children.

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,434
A thief, perhaps.

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,160
Every town has someone
it can do without. Point him out.

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,471
There is no murderer here.

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,357
I have good news for you.

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,149
You are all innocent.
Your priest has told me so.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,312
The murderer is no doubt
lurking in the countryside...

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,029
...waiting to strike at the next group
of German soldiers.

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,510
I am going to shoot 10 of you...

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,990
...in the hope that we can
demonstrate to this wretch...

27
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,995
...the responsibility he has incurred.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,589
A worker's hand.
Farmer.

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,796
Excellent.
No!

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,394
We will start with you.
Stop!

31
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,276
You have some objection, Father?
In God's name, you cannot do this.

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,799
You choose.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,075
What?
Well, they're your flock.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,674
You live among them. So you choose.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,674
I will not.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,550
You give me 10 of them,
or I will kill them all.

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,029
Men, women and children.

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,913
Shoot me.
You have five seconds.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,913
I can't.
You can't what?

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,672
Pick who will be sacrificed?

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,515
History is full of priests
who did little else.

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,229
You begin to irritate me, Father.

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,913
That was for making me wait.

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,233
I still want 10 more names.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,434
What are you doing, Father?
Are you praying?

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,037
To God?

47
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,993
It's all right, Father. I'll let you pray.

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,876
Because I know something.

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,078
You see...

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,874
...God isn't here today.

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,392
You win.

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,749
Shoot them all.
No! Wait!

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,273
Joost Harmensz, take him.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,797
Too late, Father. You had your chance.
No, please.

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,871
Take Joost. And Jon.

56
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,918
That's good.

57
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,234
And who shall be next?

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,797
That's him.

59
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,632
He's Dutch, you say?

60
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,189
Half. His mother was English.

61
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,360
Perhaps he'll be a bit more inclined
to see reason then.

62
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,511
I wouldn't be concerned
about reason, major.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,954
He's a scholar.

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,156
We studied his works
at the Maryknoll Center.

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,276
Oh, yes.

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,631
You Maryknolls.

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,791
Cropping up everywhere
these days.

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,794
It's a wonder the Jesuits don't
get after you for poaching their game.

69
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,428
We all serve in the same cause,
Major Granville.

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,158
He's not one of yours?
No.

71
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,034
A simple parish priest from Holland.

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,795
When did he develop
this archaeological bent?

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,678
Right after the war.

74
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,400
There was an incident.
Yes.

75
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,994
Yes, I heard.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,468
And his standing
in the Church now?

77
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,917
Undecided.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,472
The site is right west of Lake Rudolf,
in the Turkana district.

79
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,835
It's Early Christian, which makes
for quite a mystery given its location.

80
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,871
Anyway...

81
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,237
...we won't know more about it
until we get inside the thing.

82
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,234
I'd only uncovered a small portion
of the roof before I got...

83
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,152
...summoned here.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,470
Did you feel summoned?

85
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,596
I am sorry.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,468
It's a question of status,
you see.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,594
My status?

88
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,354
Officially, you're still listed
as a displaced person.

89
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,877
I wonder...

90
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
...why didn't you take steps...

91
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,636
...to clear the matter up?

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,632
I've been busy.

93
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,072
Beautiful, aren't they?

94
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,753
Yes, very.

95
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,559
Are you a lepidopterist?
A hobby.

96
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,358
From school days.

97
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,030
You have been busy.

98
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,750
Six archaeological digs since the war.

99
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,311
This is the longest.

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,308
If this is an official matter...

101
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,877
...then what is he doing here?
Father Francis?

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,759
Well, for one thing,
he's quite an admirer of yours.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,878
I'm about to begin missionary work
in the Turkana district.

104
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,270
I thought maybe we could
help each other.

105
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,238
You know a lot about the people.
I'd rather not. Thank you.

106
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,990
This is a little awkward.

107
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,279
Cardinal Jenkins
is somewhat concerned...

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,590
...about an exploration
of this significance...

109
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,638
...conducted by a priest
who is on sabbatical.

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,554
Temporary sabbatical.
Which comes up for review shortly.

111
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,919
Perhaps I should take this up
with the governor's office.

112
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,230
They'd only send you back to me.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,514
Why don't you have a seat, Merrin.

114
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,590
You sure you won't
have that drink?

115
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,590
The cardinal wants to be sure
that the site's religious aspects...

116
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,751
...are given proper consideration.

117
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,353
Part of Father Francis' job...

118
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,954
...will be to see to that.
Are you an archaeologist?

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,475
You're not the sole person
with an interest here.

120
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,476
I've contacted your sponsors at Oxford.
They have no objection.

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,679
If you agree as well,
I can renew your visa immediately.

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,515
We all must make our little deals
with the devil, Merrin.

123
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,435
Before there were the mines,
traders came to Derati for the water.

124
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,796
They still do...

125
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,551
...but it is a hard life.

126
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,473
Why in God's name
are they tormenting that animal?

127
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,915
It is a sacrifice.

128
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,430
The new wife of the chief elder...

129
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,558
...Sebituana, will soon give birth.

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,188
Sebituana does not yet have an heir.

131
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,635
So the people make sacrifices...

132
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,189
...in the hope that the gods
will provide one.

133
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,236
It is a necessary thing.

134
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,552
Cruelty is never necessary, Chuma.

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,792
You think we are savages?

136
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,597
I think some of you
are good people...

137
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,432
...lost in confusion.

138
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,669
There's nothing confusing
about that ceremony, Father.

139
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,316
They're weakening the bull
so that someone can approach it.

140
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,075
And as for some of the Turkana being
savages, you may want to be careful.

141
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,754
Sebituana back there
is Chuma's cousin.

142
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,477
Welcome back.

143
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,029
Did you bring the supplies?
Yes. They're in the back of the lorry.

144
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,555
Chuma, could you get
Rachel's medical supplies?

145
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,472
Here's a letter for you.

146
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,551
How was Nairobi?

147
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,679
Hello. Are you the doctor?

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,150
Habari Kani, Lankester.

149
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,788
It's good to have you back.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,514
Oh, thank you. Your room is prepared.

151
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,036
We'll need another room,
Emekwi. This is Father Francis.

152
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,476
You're a friend of Lankester's, Father?
Oh, hello. I hope so.

153
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,108
I've actually come to open
a missionary school.

154
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,999
This is your hotel?
The finest establishment in Derati.

155
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,720
Emekwi here, he's a Christian.
Maybe he can help you.

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,313
In any way I can.

157
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,074
James, Joseph.
These are my sons, Father.

158
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,949
They shall be your first pupils,
if you will have them.

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,997
That's excellent, Emekwi. Thank you.

160
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,751
Well, then, how far are we
from the site?

161
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,478
Merrin.

162
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,396
How old do you think it is?

163
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,270
Well, the architecture seems to date
to the fifth century.

164
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,559
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity by then...

165
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,234
...but they never got this far south.

166
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,519
Wanna have a look?

167
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,109
You're? You're sure it's all right?

168
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,555
Well, so long as
you don't touch anything...

169
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,153
...and keep an open mind.

170
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,597
It must have been an enormous effort
to get these materials up here.

171
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,034
Up here?

172
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,829
Yes. The stones come from a quarry
near the lake.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,116
Which means a distance...

174
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,232
...of miles.

175
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,155
It's impossible.

176
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,357
The stones look almost new.

177
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,391
With the wind and sun up here...

178
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,109
Well, they should be badly weathered.

179
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,394
The church must have been deliberately
buried right after it was built.

180
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,356
What, they came here and built
something only to bury it?

181
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,876
I don't know.
Chuma, hire some more men.

182
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,952
Have them work double shifts.
I want these walls cleared.

183
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,838
I can't understand it.
Who'd reported it?

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,116
Except for this.

185
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,394
I cannot thank you enough
for your generosity, Emekwi.

186
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,994
Oh, please, Father,
the building goes unused.

187
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,630
And besides, it is nothing more than
our Lord and Savior would expect.

188
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,712
If you need anything,
anything at all, just ask.

189
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,519
I wish others of our faith
felt that way.

190
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,072
Oh, but, of course, the town
will get the room back soon, since...

191
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,757
Since we have to build a proper school.
Oh, please, Father.

192
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,913
Do not think me a doubting Thomas.

193
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,952
But...

194
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,232
...we may not need
that new school right away.

195
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,713
Hello, Papa.

196
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,916
Hello, Joseph.

197
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,640
Hello, Papa.
Hello, James.

198
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,398
Well...

199
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,911
...it's a beginning.

200
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,954
Call for the doctor.

201
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,917
It is the heat.

202
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,918
Pick him up. Let's take him down.
I'll get some water.

203
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,160
Don't let him take it all at once.

204
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,876
Our friend is back.

205
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,919
Cheche.

206
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,548
Come for food and water again.

207
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,478
It must be even worse for him
in this heat.

208
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,710
I'll try to get him into the tent.

209
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,030
Do not let the men see that

210
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,351
Don't be afraid.

211
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,236
You got here quickly.
Your man made it sound urgent.

212
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,674
Well, is it?

213
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,559
Chuma, try to make him comfortable
in the back of my truck.

214
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,790
He needs rest and rehydration.

215
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,477
Heat stroke.

216
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,556
You're working them too hard.
There's water in the tent if you'd like...

217
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,756
I would. Thank you.

218
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,755
We had another visit
from that boy today.

219
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,797
Cheche?
Yes.

220
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,598
Any luck?

221
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,830
Couldn't even get close.

222
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,675
I had to sedate him two weeks ago.

223
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,071
Just to treat a beating
he took from a villager.

224
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,036
Why don't they help him?

225
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,829
They think he's cursed.

226
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,271
What he needs is sustained treatment.

227
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,673
Yes?

228
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,592
Nothing.

229
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,436
Early this year.

230
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,034
Two of the cattle
have been killed already.

231
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,751
Thank you, Chuma.

232
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,753
I must keep you safe
for the lady doctor.

233
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,073
Cheche.

234
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,559
Cheche.

235
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,838
The sores were very infected.

236
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,235
I've cleaned and dressed them.
There's no permanent damage.

237
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,038
The leg and arm
are a different matter.

238
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,554
Night, Mara.

239
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,391
There's nothing you can do?

240
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,591
Not for the arm.

241
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,993
The leg...

242
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,675
The leg could be theoretical
Theoret

243
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,479
Theoret...
"Theoretically."

244
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,712
Theoretically, the leg
could be rebroken...

245
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,440
...and set properly by a surgeon
from Nairobi.

246
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,716
They fly from...

247
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,030
Do you think he'd allow it?

248
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,589
It was called Chelmno.

249
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,318
That was the Polish name.
The Germans called it Kulmhof.

250
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,274
I was in a processing center
for confiscated items.

251
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,716
It's amazing what you're capable of
when your physical survival is at stake.

252
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,997
Things you think
you could never endure.

253
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,232
Well, nobody knew back then.
Everybody... We heard stories.

254
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,353
I wish they could fix that generator.

255
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,555
No one wanted to believe.

256
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,759
Of course not.

257
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,639
Who could believe such things
were happening?

258
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,189
No one wanted to believe.

259
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,070
It's so much easier to believe evil
is random...

260
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,639
...or an ogre...

261
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,352
...not that it's a human condition,
something everyone is capable of.

262
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,112
I believed God let us decide
between good and evil.

263
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,550
I chose good.

264
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,353
Evil happened.

265
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,756
Now you travel.

266
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,915
What are you looking for?

267
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,314
Nothing.

268
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,115
Sometimes I think the best view
of God is from hell.

269
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,551
This boy here...

270
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,592
You brought something
out of that young man.

271
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,833
God is in that boy that doesn't speak.

272
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,389
Until he tried to speak to you.

273
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,115
He's an unfortunate.

274
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,313
One of God's afflicted.

275
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,919
I think what you're looking for,
Father Merrin...

276
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,671
...is here.

277
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,473
You have been very brave, Cheche.

278
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,356
You're on the mend.

279
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,637
There.

280
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,756
Better, eh?

281
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,354
Better.

282
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,829
Yes. Better.

283
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,268
Merrin was right about you, Cheche.

284
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,192
I thought you'd run away.

285
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,834
Cheche...

286
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,709
...if Appa and I...

287
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,677
If we could make your leg better

288
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,032
Better.

289
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,836
Would you want that?

290
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,398
We'll have a great deal of news
for Appa, won't we?

291
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,189
Merrin, it's magnificent.

292
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,356
Wait till you get inside.

293
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,756
The war in heaven.

294
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,156
St. Michael.

295
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,236
It's so strange.

296
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,550
Churches were built to honor God...

297
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,109
...provide a house of worship,
but this...

298
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,233
This can't have been a meeting place.

299
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,872
No.

300
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,230
This had to have another purpose.

301
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,033
Merrin.

302
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,356
Look at the figures.

303
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,793
Yes.

304
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,834
Church architecture is supposed
to reach for the heavens.

305
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,878
But this looks as if
As if it were holding something down.

306
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,871
These rocks.

307
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,914
These rocks are like plugs.

308
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,037
What is that?

309
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,229
Like a sarcophagus.

310
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,558
What?

311
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,719
You hear that?
Yes.

312
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,592
Chuma.

313
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,354
Bring me some men
and the shear legs.

314
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,477
What is it?

315
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,316
What are you frightened of?

316
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,509
It's a temple of some kind.

317
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,230
What idol could inspire
a place like this?

318
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,033
I'd say it's dedicated to him.

319
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,476
Some pagan god of these parts.

320
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,718
Chuma?

321
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,395
The old people would sometimes
tell stories...

322
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,869
...of mountain demons
to scare us, but...

323
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,720
They built the church on top of this.

324
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,556
That's why they buried it.
To hold this down.

325
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,112
They used St. Michael to emphasize...

326
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,078
...that the old gods
had no power before the one.

327
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,995
But I never believed.

328
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,635
These are bloodstains.

329
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,438
People were sacrificed here.
Yeah.

330
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,797
It's almost like a scene
out of the Inquisition, isn't it?

331
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,271
The hyenas must have
attacked the cattle.

332
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,433
But the cattle...

333
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,238
...killed them.

334
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,676
Then ate them.

335
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,790
And now they die of it.

336
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,550
He wants you to stop digging.

337
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,192
He thinks the church is evil.

338
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,039
His side of the family...

339
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,236
...either old ways or nothing.

340
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,674
No argument.

341
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,398
Look here.

342
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,551
Look how it was done.

343
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,835
The workers who did this were not just
Not just workers. They were artists.

344
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,195
The mosaics came
from across the world.

345
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,750
Here. The great battle of the angels.

346
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,756
The turquoise from Egypt,
malachite from Namibia...

347
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,394
...lapis from Afghanistan.

348
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,035
Extraordinary.

349
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,879
This is St. Michael.
It's his church. It's dedicated to him.

350
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,120
But the violence.
It's the war of heaven.

351
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,352
God's angels fighting Satan
and his legion...

352
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,668
...cast into the underworld.

353
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,432
It's the sort of find
that makes a career.

354
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,957
I thought that at first,
but now it seems...

355
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,318
There is he.

356
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,438
Lucifer, source of light.

357
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,592
He was called
the most perfect of angels.

358
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,599
It will make you, Lankester.

359
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,234
But what will it make you?

360
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,354
You're trying to see through me.

361
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,510
Are you a head doctor as well?

362
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,478
It doesn't take an expert
to see you're suffering.

363
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,756
You're in guilt.

364
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,076
We're all in guilt.

365
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,951
What I told you the other night...

366
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,034
...I never told anyone else.

367
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,750
I told you because of something
I saw in you.

368
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,998
Merrin.

369
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,557
I've got to inform Cardinal Jenkins.

370
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,717
I hope you understand that if word
gets out about what's in there...

371
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,917
...the danger of violation and looting
Which is why we have...

372
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,798
...to inform Major Granville as well.

373
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,520
Ask him to send
a detachment of guards.

374
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,998
Because the British
have proved so trustworthy.

375
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,798
You haven't seen the British Museum?

376
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,951
Everything was looted
from sites like that.

377
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,076
Merrin, please.

378
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,077
You're not the only one involved.

379
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,914
Get on, boys.

380
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,278
All right, come on! Come on!
Out, out!

381
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,954
Welcome, major. Welcome to Derati.

382
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,839
Fall in on the left, quickly on the right.

383
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,073
Fall in and stand easy!

384
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,392
Good morning.

385
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,232
Good morning.

386
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,479
Beloved wherever we go.
Sir.

387
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,108
Sergeant major,
have the men stand to attention.

388
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,556
I have a feeling those good women
report to the local aristocracy.

389
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,871
And I don't want to display
even a hint of disrespect...

390
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,396
...now or at any other time. Am I clear?
Yes, sir.

391
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,472
Respect for the godforsaken
fuzzies at all times, sir.

392
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,631
That is precisely the sort of comment

393
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,074
Squad!

394
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,231
Squad, 'tion!

395
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,074
Men standing to attention, sir.
Thank you.

396
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,392
Mix it with blood or water.
It's for pain.

397
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,116
Sebituana's wife has gone into labor.
She's in a great deal of pain.

398
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,396
This is Dr. Lamu.
Oh, doctor.

399
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,835
Joseph Lamu.
Rachel Lesno.

400
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,719
So good of you to come.
Not a problem.

401
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,916
I told them to bring her here, but...

402
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,071
So I've sent some morphine.

403
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,596
What, do you think they count them?

404
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,195
Do you think they count them
every night?

405
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,673
Might do.
Might do.

406
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,070
You got no more sense
than the fuzzies, corporal.

407
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,673
Here.

408
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,035
Respect the stripes, boy.

409
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,077
Oh, "respect the stripes" now, is it?

410
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,795
I tell you, they got thousands
of the things.

411
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,679
Just a handful would make us rich
for the rest of our lives.

412
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,389
Or get us hung.
Yeah?

413
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,719
Well, they can't hang us
for having a look, now, can they?

414
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,998
His wounds are healing well.

415
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,992
I hope we do as well with this.

416
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,718
He's young.

417
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,073
His bones are strong.

418
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,117
Jesus Christ!

419
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,357
Hundreds of them.

420
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,954
Every kind of precious stone.

421
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,038
Just a handful is all I need.

422
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,755
All we need, private.

423
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,554
We pool the take. Yeah?

424
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,233
Yeah.

425
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,071
Cover them.

426
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,511
Sorry, sir?
They're British soldiers.

427
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,311
I won't have them left like that.

428
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,717
Of course, sir.

429
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,918
Richardson. Avery.

430
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,833
Get some blankets
and cover those soldiers.

431
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,436
You will keep me informed
about Cheche?

432
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,397
Yes, of course.

433
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,838
Merrin.

434
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,472
Merrin.

435
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,636
What's going on here?
What do you mean?

436
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,191
What's going on here?

437
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,430
This whole valley.

438
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,394
Why don't you stay a couple of days.

439
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,674
You hardly had any rest. I'll show you
the dig, the church we found.

440
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,159
Who's in charge here?

441
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,150
Military. Major Granville.

442
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,190
Not you?
No.

443
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,759
No, not me.

444
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,829
You take care of yourself,
Lankester Merrin.

445
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,399
Yes.

446
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,118
Thank you.

447
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,192
Who, Merrin?

448
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,632
Why?

449
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,036
Well, these were on the ground.

450
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,113
They'd been pried out
of the mosaics.

451
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,671
Maybe they were trying
to stop a robbery.

452
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,078
Got killed by the thieves.
Of course.

453
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,152
Bloody savages.
No.

454
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,880
There's no reason to suspect
the Turkana, major.

455
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,191
What?
The style of the killings...

456
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,549
...the positioning of the bodies.
He's right.

457
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,109
It's Christian imagery, not pagan.

458
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,918
John the Baptist,
head on a platter.

459
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,878
Peter the Apostle crucified
A Christian is responsible?

460
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,758
You're both insane.

461
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,673
Merrin.

462
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,954
Chuma, get that man out of here.

463
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,633
Jomo saw what happened, major.

464
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,593
Did he?

465
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,069
And what was it
this Jomo saw precisely?

466
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,152
Jomo watches from the hills
that lie above this place, and...

467
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,073
And?
He says...

468
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,280
He says he saw
the two soldiers argue.

469
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,318
One killed the other
and then stabbed himself.

470
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,913
What the devil are you saying?

471
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,670
They were stealing jewels. Then
some sort of madness overtook them

472
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,195
Be quiet! I won't hear another word!

473
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,470
That is the most...
