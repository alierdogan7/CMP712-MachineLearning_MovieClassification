- Shot

3
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:09,424
I have to open him up,
find the bleeder and stitch it.

4
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:10,943
You need a respirator.

5
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,933
The thought of her,
out here by herself...

6
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:16,430
We're gonna locate
that little girl.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,130
She's gonna be
just fine.

8
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:20,227
Two miles down is our farm.
You'll see the mailbox...

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,711
Pressure's dropping
We can't wait much longer.

10
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,587
If Shane said he'll be back,
he'll be back.

31
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:01,143

Shane gets up and when
he runs into Kingsley
in the hallway

42
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:33,492
he looks out the window
and says,

43
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:36,446
"Principal Kingsley,

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,525

00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,173
Of course you do.

What you said before,
you're right.

51
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,745
Shane's gonna make it back
with what the doctor needs.

52
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:03,972
He'll make it back.

53

I'm coming too.

62
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,346
I'm going for a walk.
Shine some light in the forest.

63
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,394
If she's out there,
give her something to look at.

64

a good idea right now?
- Dale.

Those windows,
what's on the other side?

67
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:24,362
About a 20-foot drop
with nothing to catch you,
maybe some bushes,

68
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,859
- then the athletic field.
- We just need enough time.

69
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:29,061
We got to get up there.
We got to get 'em open
and get out.

70
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,373
- Not me. Maybe you.
- Hey hey hey.

71

You really think I can
squeeze through

72

one of them tiny windows?
They'd be all over us.

73
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:40,075
Look, we lay down some fire
to get a head start.

74
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:42,480
You stay here.
I hop down and draw them away.

75
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:45,192
That gives you the chance
to get up the bleachers
and out a window.

76
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:47,629

It's got windows too,
and more my size.

80
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:58,174
I get out through one,
I double back, we meet up
out on the field.

81
00:06:58,192 --> 00:06:59,865
You're a crazy son

Just trying to do right
for that boy.

83
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:05,204
You take three shots
and you go.

84
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,774
After that I fire.
I'll lay down a cover for you.

85
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,979

There anything we can do?

It's not a bite.
I cut myself pretty bad though.

We'll have it looked at.
I'll tell them you're here.

106

We have some painkillers
and antibiotics.

107
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:32,763
I already gave him some.
If Carl needs any.

108
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,409

They don't get back soon,
we're gonna have a decision
to make.

116
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,919
And that is?

117
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,614
Whether to operate on your
boy without the respirator.

118
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:37,595
<i>- You said that wouldn't work.
- I know.</i>

- Well, do you?

00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:07,572
It ain't
the mountains of Tibet.
It's Georgia.

126
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:10,125
She could be holed up
in a farmhouse somewhere.

127

People get lost
and they survive.

128

- It happens all the time.
- She's only 12.

129
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,521
Hell, I was younger
than her and I got lost.

130
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,452
Nine days in the woods
eating berries,

131

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,439
My old man was off on
a bender with some waitress.

Merle was doing another
stint in juvie.

I was gone.

136

I made my way back though.

137
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:37,516
Went straight into the kitchen
and made myself a sandwich.

138
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,395
No worse for wear.

139
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:43,281

144
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:55,394
Only difference is Sophia's
got people looking for her.

145
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:58,155
I call that an advantage.

146
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:15,148
Maybe this isn't a world
for children anymore.

147
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:18,387
Yeah well,
we have a child.

148
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,538
Carl is here
in this world now.

149
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,143
Maybe he shouldn't be.

150
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,598
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to be.

151
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,353
You can't mean that.

152
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,554
Okay.
All right.

153
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,817
I can understand that
thought crossing your mind.

154
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,742
It didn't cross my mind, Rick.
I can't stop thinking it.

155
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,952
Why do we want Carl
to live in this world?

156
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:46,191
To have this life?

157
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,926
So he can see more people
torn apart in front of him?

158
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,749
So that he can be
hungry and scared

159
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:55,930
for however long
he has before he...

160
00:13:57,274 --> 00:14:01,207
So he can run and run
and run and run

161
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,087
and then even if he
survives he ends up...

162
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,778
he ends up just another
animal who doesn't know
anything except survival?

163
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,549
If he...

164
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,728
if he dies tonight,

165
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:18,382
it ends for him.

166
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,185
Tell me why it would
be better another way.

167
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,061
What changed?

168
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:30,193
What?

169
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,747
Jenner offered us
a way out.

170
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,733
You asked him
to let us keep trying.

171
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,570
You begged him.

172
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,091
"For as long
as we can," you said.
What changed?

173
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:41,685
There was a moment
the other day...

174
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:44,967
it was just a second
but I forgot Jacqui was dead.

175
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,758
I turned around,
I wanted to tell
her something.

176
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,108
I almost said her name.
It was just a second
and then I remembered.

177
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,763
But then I realized she
didn't have to see any of it.

178
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,350
The highway, the herds,
Sophia, Carl getting shot...

179
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:02,172
she didn't...

180
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,304
She doesn't have
to be afraid anymore.

181
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,649
Hungry.
Angry.

182
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:12,528
It hasn't stopped
happening, Rick.

183
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:16,069
It's like we live with
a knife at our throats
every second of every day.

184
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,969
But Jacqui doesn't.
Not anymore.

185
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,581
And then...

186
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,949
I thought,
"maybe Jenner was right."

187
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,479
I don't accept that.

188
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:34,527
I can't accept that.

189
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:37,306
That man surrendered.
It doesn't Matt...

190
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:41,164
it doesn't matter
what he said.

191
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:43,195
None of it.

192
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:46,717
You really think it would
be better if Carl...

193
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:54,394
if we just gave up?

194
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:58,702
Tell me why it would
be better the other way.

195
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,668
Please.

00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,868
We're in his house.

206
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,152
You had an accident.

00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,160

- It hurts, a lot.

208
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:15,682
Oh baby, I know.
I know.

209
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:19,831

214
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,446
Carl?

215
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,628
What is happening?

00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,497

you could hurt him.

218
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,811

No, ma'am.
Merle's no longer with us.

Um, venereal disease.

00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,513
That's what Daryl said.

294
00:24:57,595 --> 00:25:00,724
I'd say merle Dixon's
clap was the best thing
to ever happen to you.

295
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,050
I'm really trying
not to think about that.

296
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,938
Are you praying?

297
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:36,586
Why do you sneak up
on people so much?

298
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:38,823
You're easy
to sneak up on.

299
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,485
I was praying.

300
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:44,641
I was trying to.

301
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,359
You religious?
You pray a lot?

302
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:51,136
Actually this was
my first try.

303
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,363
Ever?

304
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,296
Wow. Sorry.

305
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,478
I didn't mean to wreck
your first time.

306
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:59,888
God probably got the gist.

308
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:05,149
Looks like they could all
use a little help right now.

309
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,548
You think...

310
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:14,617
you think God exists?

311
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:17,140
I always took it
on faith.

312
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,686
Lately I've wondered.

313
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:21,906
Everything that's happened,

314
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:24,113
there must have been a lot
of praying going on.

315
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,266
It seems quite a few
went unanswered.

316
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:31,017
Thanks.
This is really helping.

317
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,615
Sorry.
Go ahead.

00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,842
<i>Really.</i>

319
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,144
You gonna watch?

320
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,585
I'll get you
a refill instead.

321
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,866
I know it's not my business,

322
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,895
and feel free
to believe in God,

323
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:03,333
but the thing is
you've got to make it
okay somehow

324
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:06,377
no matter what happens.

325
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,247
Before it happened

326
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:57,741
we were standing there
in the woods

327
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:01,243
and this deer

328
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,631
just crossed
right in front of us.

329
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:07,279
I swear it just
planted itself there

330
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,785
and looked Carl
right in the eye.

331
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:13,766
And I looked at Carl

332
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:16,849
looking at that deer,
and that deer looking
right back at Carl.

333
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,831
And that moment just...

334
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,387
( Sighs )

335
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,795
Slipped away.

336
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:30,348
It slipped away.

337
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:34,448
That's what he was talking
about when he woke up,

338
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:37,909
not about getting shot

339
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,673
or what happened
at the church.

340
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,992
He talked about
something beautiful,

341
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:46,712
something living.

342
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,859
There's still
a life for us,

343
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:52,517
a place maybe like this.

344
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:55,581
It isn't all death
out there.

345
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,936
It can't be.

346
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,712
We just have to be
strong enough

347
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:03,260
after everything we've seen
to still believe that.

348
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,863
Why is it better for Carl
to live even in this world?

349
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:13,490
He talked about
the deer, Lori.

350
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,764
<i>He talked about
the deer.</i>

351
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,409
<i>Shane:
Oh, shit.</i>

352
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:25,645
( Both groan )

353
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:28,479
Got to get to the street,
double back to the truck.

354
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,046
- Look, we ain't
gonna make it, okay?
- Got to try, man.

355
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:33,316
- Come on, get up.
- You're gonna take these bags

356
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,970
- and you're gonna go.
- I ain't leaving you behind.

357
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,757
Okay.

358
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:45,940
How many rounds
you got left?

359
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:47,713
Four. You?

360
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:49,957
Five and one in the pipe.

361
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,535
( Snarling, growling )

362
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:59,710
( Gunshot )

363
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,031
( Gunshot )

364
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,846
He's still losing blood
faster than we can replace it.

365
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,152
And with the swelling
in his abdomen

366
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,206
we can't wait any longer

367
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,296
or he's just going
to slip away.

368
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,842
Now I need to know right now

369
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:26,938
if you want me to do this,

370
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:29,485
because I think your boy
is out of time.

371
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:33,297
You have to make a choice.

372
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:35,937
- A choice?
- A choice.

373
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,441
You have to tell me
what it is.

374
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:41,554
You have to
tell me what it is.

375
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,015
We do it.

376
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,218
Okay, get the corner
of that bed.

377
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:01,931
Let's get the sheets down.

378
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:04,647
Get the I.V. bag
on the sheet.

379
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:08,534
<i>Okay, on three.</i>

380
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:11,524
One, two, three.

381
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,903
Rick, Lori,

382
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:34,951
you may want to step out.

383
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:38,710
<i>( Truck approaching )</i>

384
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,196
<i>Rick:
Oh God.</i>

385
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,697
You stay here with him.

386
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:02,106
- Carl?
- There's still a chance.

387
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,416
Otis?

388
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:11,223
No.

389
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:20,524
We say nothing to Patricia.

390
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,975
Not till after.
I need her.

391
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:45,155
They kept blocking us
at every turn.

392
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,860
We had nothing left.
We were down to 10 rounds.

393
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:50,452
Then he said...
he said he'd cover me

394
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,210
and that I should
keep going.

395
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:54,947
So that's what I did.
I just...

396
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:57,586
I kept going.
But I...

397
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:03,196
I looked back and he...

398
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:09,831
I tried.

399
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:12,467
He wanted to make it right.

400
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,879
( Crying )

401
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,462
Andrea.
Wait.

402
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:06,496
What do you want, Dale?

403
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,043
To give you this.

404
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:11,122
<i>I care about you</i>

405
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:14,065
so I made a choice
for you...  choices.

406
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,977
I know why I did it,
but this is not my gun.

407
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:20,867
And the choices
that I made for you

408
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,372
were not mine to make.

409
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,719
But I can still ask,

410
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,297
and this is not
to make you guilty

411
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:37,110
or put me ahead of you,
but I can still ask,

412
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:40,292
please...

413
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:44,486
Don't make me regret this.

414
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,595
I'll take watch.

415
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:53,219
So do you forgive
me for...

416
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,166
do you forgive me?

417
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,698
I'm trying.

418
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:16,999
I've known Otis
since I was a kid.

419
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:20,664
He's run this farm
since before my mother died.

420
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,002
Who else?

421
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:35,777
Who'd you lose?

422
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:41,573
You told me I had
to make it okay somehow.

423
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:45,697
That's what you've been
trying to do, right?

424
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:47,670
Which ones?

425
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,592
Stepmother.

426
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,344
Stepbrother.

427
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:18,433
He seems to have
stabilized.

428
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:20,277
( Exhales )
Oh God.

429
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,686
I don't have words.

430
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,908
I don't either.
Wish I did.

431
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,203
How do I tell Patricia
about Otis?

432
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,527
You go to Carl.

433
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,878
I'll go with Hershel.

434
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,926
( Patricia sobbing )

435
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:41,605
( Sobbing )

436
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,348
Stay.

437
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:51,624
The bathroom's upstairs.

438
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:54,717
- I brought you some clothes.
- Thank you.

439
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,428
They won't fit well.
They were Otis's.

440
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,242
<i>Shane:
How many rounds
you got left?</i>

441
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,657
<i>Otis:
Four. You?</i>

442
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,571
<i>Shane:
Five and one in the pipe.</i>

443
00:39:56,573 --> 00:39:59,348
( Groans )
Come on.

444
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:25,502
( Panting )

445
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:52,622
- Down to my last.
- Me too.

446
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,866
I'm sorry.

447
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:01,391

Will you give it...  ah!

450
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,566
Give it!

451
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:12,022
( Otis screaming )

452
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:18,900
I'll kill you.
