The Walking Dead...</i>

00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:05,565
Don't hurt my little girl.

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,800
Don't pretend to be a governor.

4
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:11,962
Failing to see the
devil beside you.

5
00:00:12,082 --> 00:00:13,648
Oh, I see him all right.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,592
I need to talk to
you about Carol.

7
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,869
I'm in charge.
No dead weight.

8
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,726
End of the world don't mean shit
when you got a tank.

9
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:26,458
Maybe we can find
a better place.

10
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,927
Governor: <i>I have to talk all
of you into doing something.</i>

11
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:38,347
Something I know we need to do.

12
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,220
And I don't know
how to talk about it.

13
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:49,692
What do you want us to do?

14
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:53,129
I want you to survive.

15
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,400
We're not gonna last here.

16
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,703
The biters, there'll be
a herd of them.

17
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:03,606
They'll fill the pits,

18
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:06,125
<i>they'll crawl over one another.</i>

19
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:10,930
There'll be enough to tear
right through our camp.

20
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:15,151
<i>Or it'll be people.</i>

21
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:17,587
There's nothing between us
and the rest of the world.

22
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:20,990
<i>Nothing between us and them.</i>

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,962
We stay here, we'll die.

24
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:34,904
<i>The people who destroyed the
camp I was in with Martinez...</i>

25
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:38,107
<i>they live in a prison.</i>

26
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:41,644
<i>It's north off Highway 34.</i>

27
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,963
They got walls...

28
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,449
<i>fences,</i>

29
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,186
<i>plots of land for farming.</i>

30
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:53,139
We could live there.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,660
Uh-uh.

32
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,597
If we're willing
to take it from 'em.

33
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:07,837
<i>I have a plan to do it</i>
<i>without anyone getting hurt.</i>

34
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,972
I captured two of them.

35
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,041
What?

36
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,676
I was scouting the prison

37
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,845
and our paths crossed,
so I took 'em.

38
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:18,280
- You took them?
- They're the key.

39
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:23,886
They're gonna help us take that
prison without firing a shot.

40
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:27,490
We can have it and we don't
need to kill anyone.

41
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,994
But...

42
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:36,349
we need to be prepared to.

43
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,635

45
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,572
The people in this prison,
not all of them are bad.

46
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:19,309
But most of them are thieves,

47
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,579
murderers.

48
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,248
Now why should people like
that have peace of mind

49
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:28,752
when we're burying our own
just about every day?

50
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:32,489
These people,
they mutilated me...

51
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:35,859
burned my camp...

52
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,913
killed my daughter.

53
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,501
Now you saw me--
I tried.

54
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,553
I tried to die.

55
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:48,889
'Cause I didn't want to
accept that you couldn't live

56
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,424
in this world without getting
blood on your hands.

57
00:03:51,425 --> 00:03:53,894
I found you people
and I don't want to die.

58
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:56,713
I don't want <i>you to die.</i>

59
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:02,269
Now we need
to move-- <i>now.</i>

60
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,221
They're gonna realize
their people are gone

61
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,940
and they're gonna start getting
ready for whatever's next.

62
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,910
We need to surprise them.
Scare them.

63
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,863
<i>Huh?</i>

64
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:14,931
And we will win.

65
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,773
I'm in.

66
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:26,610
- I'm in.
Man: - Me, too.

67
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,044
Pack up and get ready.

68
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,913
We'll go over the plan
in half an hour.

69
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:32,449
- Come on.
Man: - Let's do it.

70
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,258
Where's Megan?

71
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,195
She's reading in the trailer.

72
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,597
You hear all that?

73
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,100
I said we didn't have
to fight for another place.

74
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,435
I know.

75
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,105
Killing people?

76
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:58,675
No.
Killing killers.

77
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:01,711
You said they weren't
all bad people.

78
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,146
Well, they're with bad people.

79
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,615
Am I?

80
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,322
I'm gonna keep you alive.

81
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:15,759
I'm gonna keep Megan alive.

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,195
The only judgment
on me I care about

83
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:19,996
is whether you two
are still breathing.

84
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:24,201
It's good that you heard,

85
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:27,137
that you know.

86
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:31,141
Lily...
I love you.

87
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,612
I don't know who you are.

88
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,648
Hey, you told me there has
to be someplace better

89
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,617
and that I was gonna
help you find it.

90
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,887
You knew me, Lily.

91
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,790
It was always
gonna be like this.

92
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,379
You need to pack up, too.

93
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,505
Michonne: <i>- Don't touch me.</i>
<i>- Stay still.</i>

94
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:05,976
( hisses )
Get off me.

95
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:28,915
You should eat.
It's gonna be a long day.

96
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,800
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

97
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:34,838
I don't believe that.

98
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,757
Well, I don't care.

99
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,176
Just tell us what this is.

100
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,345
Please.

101
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,597
It isn't personal.

102
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,066
Then what is it?

103
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:51,054
Michonne, I want you to know...

104
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:54,691
Penny, my daughter,

105
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:57,577
she was dead.
I know that now.

106
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:59,412
Now, I don't want to hurt you.

107
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:00,897
I don't want to hurt anyone.

108
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,565
I need the prison, that's it.

109
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,534
There are people
I need to keep alive.

110
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,402
You two are gonna
help me take it.

111
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:08,788
No one needs to die.

112
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,041
I'm gonna kill you.

113
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,792
No, you won't.

114
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:15,578
- I'm gonna take my--
- Stop it.

115
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,213
You want the prison?

116
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:21,768
Yeah. And I'll take it
as peacefully as I can.

117
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,970
- Governor--
- Don't call me that.

118
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:29,309
Your people, our people,

119
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,278
we can find a way
to live together.

120
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,815
These people you need
to keep alive,

121
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:38,118
do you love them?

122
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,970
You're a good man, Hershel.

123
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,373
A better man than Rick.

124
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,825
Everything you've said,
the way you've said it,

125
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:49,295
you've changed.
So has Rick.

126
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:53,166
The two of us will never
be able to live together.

127
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:55,668
Michonne and I, we'll never
be able to live together.

128
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,722
- We'll find a way.
- I found a way!

129
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,477
I'm trying hard.

130
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:09,265
There's all kinds of ways
I could do this.

131
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:13,770
This way, you get to live
and I get to be...

132
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,497
You say you want
to take this prison

133
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:26,816
as peacefully as possible.

134
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,786
That means you'd be willing
to hurt people to get it.

135
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:32,288
My daughters would be there.

136
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,491
<i>That's who you'd be hurting.</i>

137
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:41,881
If you understand what it's
like to have a daughter,

138
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:45,552
then how can you threaten
to kill someone else's?

139
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,975
Because they aren't mine.

140
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,615
<i>( door closes )</i>

141
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:10,542
Ready?

142
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:13,178
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

143
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,631
They'll be safe here
until we get back.

144
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:20,669
Biters can't make it
across the water.

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,142
If it's safe by the water, then let's
just go someplace by the water.

146
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,094
- Lily.
- You don't have to do this.

147
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:32,197
Anyplace that's safe,
really safe,

148
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,199
someone's already there.

149
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:38,520
Think about Megan, huh?

150
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,139
Lily:
I am.

151
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,610
What's she gonna be
in this world?

152
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:49,698
She's gonna be alive.

153
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:10,335
Making mud pies?

154
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:13,171
- Peanut butter sandwiches.
- ( laughs )

155
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:28,153
How about a hug before I go?

156
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,689
My hands are muddy.
See?

157
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,041
Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,861
Well, I wouldn't want
to get my coat dirty.

159
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,364
( laughs )

160
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,752
I messed it all up.

161
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:47,089
No, you made it better.

162
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,075
( sighs )

163
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:10,696
I could use a vacation.

164
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:13,064
- ( laughs )
- <i>Get away.</i>

165
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:15,400
Just for a weekend.

166
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,370
Yeah.

167
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,708
You know, our anniversary
is coming up.

168
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,259
It is?

169
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,128
One of these days.

170
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,597
( laughs )

171
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,585
You ever been
to Amicalola Falls?

172
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,604
<i>Tallest waterfall in Georgia.</i>

173
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:38,256
- Mm-mmm. <i> - My dad took me there</i>
<i>when I was little.</i>

174
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:41,360
When we were up there,

175
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:44,929
all the way at the top
looking down,

176
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,448
I felt like I was flying.

177
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,269
I'll go load up
the station wagon.

178
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,739
( laughs )

179
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:00,812
I'm gonna get you some water.

180
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:04,383
- I can get it.
- I know.

181
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:06,501
But I'm doing it.

182
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:12,340
I'll be right back.

183
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:24,969
Man, you couldn't have
waited till we got back?

184
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,138
Until Tyreese got back?

185
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,107
I could've handled that.

186
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,492
Hey. Hey.

187
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:33,445
She killed two of our own.

188
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:35,280
She couldn't be here.

189
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:39,284
She's gonna be all right.

190
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,654
She has a car,
supplies, weapons.

191
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,206
She's a survivor.

192
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,708
Stop saying that
like you don't believe it.

193
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:55,367
She did it.
She said it was for us.

194
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:57,469
That's how it was in her head.

195
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,338
She wasn't sorry.

196
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,358
Man, that's her,
but that ain't her.

197
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,848
What are we supposed to do
about those two girls?

198
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:15,070
I told her
we'd look after them.

199
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:26,214
I haven't told Tyreese yet.

200
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:32,671
I don't know how
he's gonna take it.

201
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:40,846
Let's go find out.

202
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,725
( footsteps approaching )

203
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:00,782
Bob.

204
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,121
You should be resting.

205
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,373
After the night you had,
so should you.

206
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,108
I'm going to.

207
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,577
On my way to find
an open cell in C block

208
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,746
until D gets cleaned up.

209
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,084
I just wanted to say

210
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,452
thank you.

211
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,990
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Hershel

212
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,058
and you.

213
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,129
( sighs )
Hershel, not me.

214
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,231
- <i>You helped save my life.</i>
<i>- Stop.</i>

215
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:34,633
- <i>Bob.</i>
<i>- Stop.</i>

216
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,935
<i>You put those meds</i>
<i>in my IV bag.</i>

217
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:38,403
And now, in a couple minutes,

218
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:41,406
I'm gonna feel
the sun on my skin.

219
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,112
So you are gonna let me
thank you.

220
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,117
( gasps )

221
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:55,587
Sasha.

222
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,622
You're not strong enough yet.

223
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:00,425
Then help me.

224
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:05,146
Tyreese.
You down here?

225
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,098
Tyreese:
<i>Rick, that you?</i>

226
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,690
You guys got to see this.

227
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:17,976
Can we take a beat? There's
something we need to talk about.

228
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:20,161
It can wait.
Come on.

229
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:30,121
Look.

230
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,660
The hell?

231
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,381
<i>I was just looking for...</i>

232
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:41,166
answers...

233
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,568
and I found this.

234
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:48,223
Same person that killed
Karen and David did this.

235
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,358
Remember the rats at the fence?

236
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,644
They showed up the same
day she was killed.

237
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:54,729
We got a psychopath
living with us.

238
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,848
- Tyreese.
- We got to find him, Rick.

239
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:58,984
And I'm not gonna sleep
until we do.

240
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:03,488
Tyreese...

241
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,707
whoever did this,

242
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,876
I don't think that's
who killed Karen.

243
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:10,879
Why?

244
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,415
<i>( explosion )</i>

245
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,883
Come on.

246
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,674
Get back!

247
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,787
Rick!

248
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,223
Come down here.

249
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:40,358
We need to talk.

250
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,592
It's not up to me.

251
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:02,597
There's a council now.
They run this place.

252
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:04,883
Is Hershel on the council?

253
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:22,067
What about Michonne?

254
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,037
She on the council, too?

255
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,510
I don't make decisions anymore.

256
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:37,615
You're making
the decisions today, Rick.

257
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:41,453
Come down here. Let's...

258
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:43,688
Let's have that talk.

259
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:25,518
( faintly ) We can do this.
All right?

260
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,661
( squeaks )

261
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:02,788
We can't take 'em all on.

262
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:04,490
We'll go through
the admin building,

263
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,091
through the woods
like we planned.

264
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:08,661
We ain't got
the numbers no more.

265
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,147
When's the last time someone
checked the stash on the bus?

266
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,115
Day before we hit the Big Spot.

267
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:15,234
We were running low on rations then.
We're lower now.

268
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:18,738
Yeah, we'll manage.
Things go south,

269
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:20,740
everyone heads for that bus.
Let everybody know.

270
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:23,108
What if everybody doesn't
know when things go bad?

271
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,844
How long do we wait?

272
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:27,146
As long as we can.

273
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,787
Let 'em go right now.

274
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,290
I'll stay down here.

275
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,560
Talk as long as you want.

276
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,596
But you let 'em go.

277
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:46,432
You got a tank.
You don't need hostages.

278
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:49,268
I do.

279
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,204
This is just to
show you I'm serious.

280
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:55,875
Not to blast a hole
in our new home.

281
00:19:57,711 --> 00:20:00,212
<i>You and your people, you have
till sundown to get out of here</i>

282
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,715
or they die.

283
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:05,818
Doesn't have
to go down this way.

284
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,321
I got more people,
more firepower.

285
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:14,694
We need this prison.

286
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:20,633
There it is.

287
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,804
It's not about the past.
It's about right now.

288
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:27,840
There are children here.

289
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:30,693
Some of them are sick.
They won't survive.

290
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:38,034
I have a tank.

291
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,519
And I'm letting you
walk away from here.

292
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:44,323
What else is there
to talk about?

293
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,051
You good?

294
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,454
Yeah.

295
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:22,912
( faintly )
All right.

296
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:23,489
Megan: <i>Mommy, can you
please help me dig?</i>

297
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,801
<i>Mommy, can you please help me?</i>

298
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,470
I'll be right there, honey.

299
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,892
Mommy, it's too heavy.

300
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:48,180
I hear you.
I'll be there in a sec.

301
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:13,872
Lily: <i>I'm sorry, honey.
What did you say?</i>

302
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:16,676
It's okay.
I can do it myself.

303
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:56,415
( screaming )

304
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,285
Megan! Megan!

305
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:01,887
- ( snarling )
- Mommy! Mommy!

306
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,957
( screaming )
Mommy!

307
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:07,226
Megan!

308
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:08,828
( crunches )

309
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:11,063
Megan!

310
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:18,121
Governor:
<i>I could shoot you all.</i>

311
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:21,124
You'd all shoot back.
I know that.

312
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,359
But we'll win
and you'll be dead.

313
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,028
All of you.

314
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:27,280
Doesn't have to be like that.

315
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:30,283
Like I said, it's your choice.

316
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:34,270
<i>( walkers snarling )</i>

317
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,147
( gunshots )

318
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:57,093
Noise will only draw
more of them over.

319
00:24:57,094 --> 00:25:00,146
The longer you wait,

320
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:02,615
the harder it will be
for you to get out of here.

321
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,806
We got to do something.

322
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,975
Your dad's got it.

323
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:14,477
They're talking.

324
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,245
We could kill
the Governor right now.

325
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:19,615
- From 50 yards?
- I'm a good shot.

326
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,118
I could end this right now.

327
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,754
Yeah, or you could start
something else.

328
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,456
You got to trust him.

329
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,331
We're here.

330
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,133
Where are you guys going?

331
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:39,502
- To the bus. Come on.
- No.

332
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:42,688
You know the plan. That's
where we're supposed to go.

333
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:44,173
Carol told us to be strong.

334
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:47,476
To protect ourselves.
They have guns.

335
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,612
We should have guns, too.

336
00:25:49,613 --> 00:25:51,146
We should help.

337
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:58,287
You got maybe about
an hour of sunlight left.

338
00:25:59,456 --> 00:26:01,156
I suggest you start packing.

339
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,740
<i>The longer you wait,</i>

340
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,009
the harder it's gonna be
for you to get out of here.

341
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,198
We can all--

342
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:33,155
we can all live together.

343
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:38,828
There's enough room
for all of us.

344
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:41,080
More than enough.

345
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,716
But I don't think
my family would sleep well

346
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:46,602
knowing that you
were under the same roof.

347
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:49,171
We'd live in different
cell blocks.

348
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,373
We'd never have
to see each other

349
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,509
till we're all ready.

350
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,679
It could work.

351
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,564
You know it could.

352
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,751
It could've.

353
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:04,020
But it can't.

354
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:07,556
Not after Woodbury.

355
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,726
Not after Andrea.

356
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:13,412
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.

357
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:17,249
Fact is, it's gonna be
a hell of a lot harder

358
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,970
than standing here
shooting at each other.

359
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,256
But I don't think
we have a choice.

360
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:29,045
We don't.
You do.

361
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:31,747
We're not leaving.

362
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:38,471
You try and force us,
we'll fight back.

363
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:41,774
Like you said,

364
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:43,759
the gunshots will just
bring more of them out.

365
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,111
They'll take down the fences.

366
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:48,614
<i>Without the fences,</i>
<i>this place is worthless.</i>

367
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,786
Now, we can all
live in the prison

368
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,604
or none of us can.

369
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:03,963
We'll fix the damn fences.

370
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,784
- No--!
- ( sobbing )

371
00:28:20,814 --> 00:28:23,599
You.
You in the ponytails.

372
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,535
Is this what you want?
Is this what any of you want?

373
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:29,939
What we want is what you got.

374
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,241
Period.

375
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:35,277
Time for you to leave, asshole.

376
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,862
Look, I fought him before.

377
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:40,616
And after, we took in
his old friends.

378
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:43,786
They've become leaders
in what we have here.

379
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:47,173
Now you put down your weapons,

380
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:49,041
walk through those gates...

381
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,862
you're one of us.

382
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:06,692
We let go of all of it,

383
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:08,911
and nobody dies.

384
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:14,417
Everyone who's alive right now.

385
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:19,354
Everyone who's made it
this far.

386
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:21,740
We've all done
the worst kinds of things

387
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:23,742
just to stay alive.

388
00:29:25,212 --> 00:29:27,496
<i>But we can still come back.</i>

389
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:30,032
We're not too far gone.

390
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:35,554
<i>We get to come back.</i>

391
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,423
<i>I know...</i>

392
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:41,560
we all can change.

393
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,202
Liar.

394
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:16,578
( silent )

395
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:23,219
No!

396
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,920
Ah!

397
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:27,389
( gunfire )

398
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:32,261
- ( screams )
- Daddy!

399
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,731
Ah!

400
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,284
( gasping )

401
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:26,215
You!

402
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:29,618
Pick up your weapon!
Fight, now!

403
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,539
<i>( gunfire popping, ringing )</i>

404
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:46,518
This isn't right.

405
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,170
- We're not supposed to be doing this.
- We are.

406
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:50,556
He chopped a guy's
head off with a sword.

407
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:03,452
( hammer clicks )

408
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:08,907
We have to stay here.
It's too late.

409
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,559
You understand me?

410
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,711
Stay behind me
and if we get separated,

411
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:14,496
you just go run somewhere
safe and hide.

412
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,732
You hear me? You go
someplace safe and hide

413
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:19,935
and I will find you when this is all over.
I will find you.

414
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:21,887
Go through the fence
in your cars.

415
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:24,256
Get your guns, we go in.

416
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:26,425
Kill them all.

417
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:29,345
Roger that.
Move in!

418
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:04,745
Go ahead!

419
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,658
I'm out of ammo.

420
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:19,493
Run for the bus.
I'll cover you.

421
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,183
Move up!

422
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,164
Go!
Get out of here!

423
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:58,164
- Go, go! Come on!
- Glenn's in there. I have to get him.

424
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:00,550
- I'm going with you.
- Get these people on the bus.

425
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,686
- Be ready to drive. I'll be right back.
- What if you're not?

426
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,521
- You have to go without us.
- I won't go without you.

427
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,974
Beth, Beth, get these people
on the bus, okay?

428
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:09,009
It's your job.
We've all got jobs to do.

429
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,866
( grunts )

430
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:27,494
- Glenn!
- What the hell's going on?

431
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:30,163
We have to get everybody
out of here.

432
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:35,269
( grunts )

433
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:18,712
Beth!
Where's Beth?

434
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:20,630
- She went to find you.
- Where?

435
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:22,749
We'll find her.
She'll be okay.

436
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,935
- No.
- What? No, you're not going by yourself.

437
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:27,087
I'll be right back.

438
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:30,390
Maggie...

443
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:12,599
On your right.

Sasha! Sasha!
Have you seen Beth?

446
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:32,869
- Is she on the bus?
- No. She's--

447
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,538
Ah!

448
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,625
We gotta stay down.

449
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:41,962
Look inside my shirt. Check
my back for an exit wound.

450
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:43,663
Yeah.

451
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:46,183
That's good.
We can treat it.

452
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,301
- Sasha: Not here.
- Stay down. We'll find someplace safe.

453
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:54,474
We'll figure it out.
Come on.

Hey!
We go that way!
