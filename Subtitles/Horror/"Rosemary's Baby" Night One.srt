Nena.

Nena, listen to...

Nena, please.
Open the door, Nena.

12
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,277
Nothing but lies!

13
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,345
Open the door!

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,081
You betrayed me!

So, how have you been feeling?

35

I'm good.

36
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,440
Anxious, but good.

37
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,242
- Has it been four months?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,276
Yep.

39
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:58,612
We found out she was pregnant...

40
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,214
I think it was
the all-star game, right?

41
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,216
And now, we're through the playoffs.

42

- Yeah, that's four months.
- Knicks fan?

Nets.

44
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,554
Mm. That's too bad.

We've been planning this
for a long time.

Give me one second, okay?

Okay.

Hey.

Hey, it's fine.

(Inhales)
Okay.

57
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:49,863
I'm sure there's just something wrong
with the machine, that's all.

58
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,969
What if there's something
wrong with me?

59
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:59,206
- Hey, Rosemary, no.
- I can feel it.

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Okay.

61

- Hi.

62
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,280
Is everything okay?

78
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,701
Pardon.

- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

80
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,371
Je suis perdu.

81
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,874
Je suis americaine, of course.
(Laughs)

82
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,110
Can you please help me
find this street?

83

84
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,615

Pardon, pardon, pardon.

86
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,919
You cross the street...

87
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,253
- On your right.
- No, no, no.

88
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,354

No, no, no, no, no.

89

90
00:05:58,493 --> 00:05:59,726
Thank you.

Thank you.

93
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,310
Julie.

94

Hey! (Squeals) Oh, my...

95
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,113
(Laughs)
Hi.

96
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:23,650
Hello. Oh.

97
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:26,086
I'm so sorry.

98
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,621
It's okay. It's okay.

99
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,523
I don't ever want to hear those words.

100
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,624
- All right?
- Okay.

101
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,993
- Thank you.
- For what?

102
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:36,497
Guy would've never gotten his job
if it wasn't for you.

103
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,199
One year in Paris, Julie...
Oh, my God...

104
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:41,869
- At the Sorbonne too.
- (Speaking French)

105
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:45,272
Listen, all I did was put his C.V.
at the top of the pile.

106
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:46,673
He's pretty impressive all on his own.

107
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,442
Yes, he is.
(Laughs)

108
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,444
By the way, you won't be thanking me

109
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,112
once you see what they consider
faculty housing.

110
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:54,181
- No, we saw it. It's fine.
- Yeah?

111
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,516
Actually, it's perfect.

112
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,683
- It's exactly what we need.
- Okay.

113
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,318
- Yes.
- Merci.

114
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,453
- Do you want to walk?
- Yes!

115
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,022
Oh, good.

116
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,991
So how's Guy's novel going?

117
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,327
Every time I check,
he's one revision away from "the end."

118
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:09,997
There's a publisher interested,
so he's trying to finish.

119
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,565
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,966
And what about you?

121
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,501
- I'm coping.
- Yeah?

122
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:17,471
Yeah, Guy doesn't want me to work,
at least not immediately.

123
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,039
He's so sweet.

124
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,541
He says he wants to be the one

125
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,576
to wear the pants
in the family for a while.

126
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,513
Well, you've supported him
all these years as a dancer.

127
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,182
- That's not easy.
- Yeah.

128
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:31,185
And he should return the favor
and make the big bucks for a change.

129
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:32,920
(Laughs)
Yes.

130
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,723
But I encourage him because
I believe in his writing.

131
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm just so happy that you're here.

132
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:40,594
(Laughs)

133
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,995
I want to take care of you.

134
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,030
Oh, you know what we should do?

135
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,264
What?

136
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,166
Take cooking classes?

137
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,668
- Yes.
- Yes?

138
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,636
Oh, my God,
I've been dreaming to do that

139
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,705
ever since we found out
we were coming to Paris.

140
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,173
- Yes! Yes!
- It's done.

141
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,242
- I'm making all the arrangements.
- Oh, God.

142
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:58,612
We perfect a couple of gourmet dishes,
then make it for Guy.

143
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,014
And get him off his obsession
with macaroni and cheese.

144
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,749
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

145
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:04,885
I already did that.
He's been banned from them.

146
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,620
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

147
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,422
How did you do that?

148
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,425
- Pastrami sandwiches.
- (Laughs)

149
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,627
Yeah, we really need
these cooking classes.

150
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,796
Absolutely.

151
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,480
Can I?

152
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,150
Sure.

153
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:39,119

154
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:41,388
- He's perfect.
- Thank you.

156
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:45,059
Hey!

157
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:47,027
Stop him! Somebody stop him!

He has my bag!

163
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:00,774
He took my bag!

(Tires screech)

165
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:05,612
Oh, my God!

Hey!

- Thank God he's okay.

170
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,691
You can't kill a cockroach.

171
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:18,959
Thank you, sir. I got it.

172
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:22,596
- Thank you. Thank you.
- (Man murmuring in French)

173
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,965
Wait a minute.
This isn't my wal...

(Panting)
Oh, my God.

175
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,838
Let's see.

00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,510
"Margaux Castevet."

177
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:39,546

00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,192
- Oui. Yes.
- Great.

185
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:28,195
I have this wallet, and it belongs
to one of your tenants

186
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,364
by the name of Margaux Castevet.

187
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:31,932
Well, thank you.

188
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,368
I will make sure
it is returned to her.

189
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:36,837
I'd rather give this to her myself.

190
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,540
Looking for a reward.

191
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:42,042
No.

192
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:44,011
No, I'm not.

193
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,547
Can you please call her?

194
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,916
- Margaux Castevet.
- My ears are burning.

195
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,851
Are you looking for me, darling?

196
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:52,119
Yes.

197
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,254
Yes. I have your wallet.

198
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,622
Oh, my God.

199
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,758
I just spent the last hour
with the police.

200
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,727
A complete waste of time.

201
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,096
They had no hopes of returning it.

202
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,031
You're an absolute angel.

203
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,800
- No.
- American?

204
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:08,869
I love Americans.

205
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,904
You're so honest and open.

206
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,774
Everything can be seen on the face.

207
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,776
How did you find this?

208
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,479
I think we were robbed
by the same thief, actually.

209
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:19,580
Look.

210
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,949
I hope you beat him to a pulp.

211
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,417
You must take this for your efforts.

212
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,119
No, no. I'm so sorry.

213
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,453
I just... I'm happy.

214
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,956
I'm happy that it's returned
to its rightful owner, that's all.

215
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,224
What's your name?

216
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,493
Rosemary. Rosemary Woodhouse.

217
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,294
- Rosemary?
- Yes.

218
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,496
An old-fashioned name.

219
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,465
I like it. Very feminine.

220
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,666
Thank you.

221
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,168
Where are you staying in Paris?

222
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:44,171
My husband... he's teaching
at the Sorbonne.

223
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,939
And we're staying
at the faculty housing.

224
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:49,610
Oh, my husband is on
the Sorbonne honorary board.

225
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:53,614
You must come join us
at our party here tonight.

226
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,150
I won't take no for an answer.

227
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,285
You will come with your husband.

228
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:01,688
I insist.

229
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,090
Okay.

230
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:04,525
Thank you.
(Laughs)

231
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,927
- See you tonight.
- Yes. Au revoir.

232
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,462
Au revoir.

233
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,497
Nice to meet you.

234
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,546
- (Laughs)
- What?

235
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,881
The drawers are full,
all the drawers are full.

236
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,985
And I still haven't unpacked
the second bag.

237
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,019
What about this?

238
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:37,191
Okay, good news.

239
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,292
I think I found the kitchen.

240
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,327
- (Laughs)
- Oh, man.

241
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,896
Well, at least it happens to be
right next to the bedroom.

242
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,399
I guess that makes breakfast
in bed a cinch.

243
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,501
And I thought
New York apartments were small.

244
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:49,203
Hey, look at it this way.

245
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:53,307
At least it's only for an entire year.

246
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:55,209
We'll take shifts then.

247
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:57,811
Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, I get the room.

248
00:12:57,846 --> 00:13:00,814
Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays, you get it.

249
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,216
And what about Sundays?

250
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,818
We stay in bed naked
all day together.

251
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,587
Ooh, can we make it Sunday
every day?

252
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:08,021
(Laughter)

253
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:10,657
Oh, the lady whose wallet
I returned,

254
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,826
she invited us to come
to her party tonight.

255
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,194
Party? Wait.

256
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:17,364
I still cannot believe that you went
chasing after a purse snatcher.

257
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,233
That's crazy. You're crazy.

258
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,268
My passport was in the bag.
What did you expect?

259
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:24,104
Well, what do you think?
Can we go to the party tonight?

260
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,940
Wouldn't you rather just stay here
in our new palace and eat

261
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,743
a delicious bowl of
soupe poulet et nouilles?

262
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,045
Well, if you put it that way,

263
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,547
- how could I refuse?
- Oh, you like that?

264
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:36,216
You want to hear about
what I want to do with you later?

265
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,785
Yes.

266
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:41,455
(Speaking French)

267
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:43,090
What did you just say?

268
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,958
- Ooh.
- It sounded so sexy.

269
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:46,193
- You like it, yeah?
- Yeah.

270
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:47,428
Mm.

271
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,229
I said let's unpack the bags...

272
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,264
Mm-hmm.

273
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:53,133
And clean... the room.

274
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,469
That's it?

275
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,037
Yeah, that's it. What?

276
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:59,540
- Funny man.
- Hey, come back.

277
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:00,974
All right.

278
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,743
I should put in a couple
of hours on the book.

279
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,712
It's gotta be every day or nothing.

280
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,113
(Knock on door)

281
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:09,149
You expecting anybody?

282
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:17,624
Mr. and Mrs. Woodhouse?

283
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,393
Yes?

284
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:23,864
I'm here to take you to the party.

285
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:35,442
(Low chatter, laughter)

286
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,810
Um...

287
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,078
(Clank)

288
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:39,913
Voila.

289
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,715
(Laughter)

290
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:47,788
This door?

291
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,823
(Clears throat)

292
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:52,359
(Doorbell rings)

293
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:54,061
(Indistinct chatter)

294
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,663
(Classical music in background)

295
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,033
- What?
- MAN: You're welcome.

296
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,334
- (Laughs)
- What?

297
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:01,935
Are you kidding?
Look at these people.

298
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,637
We should put on aprons
and start serving them.

299
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,805
(Speaking French)

300
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,274
The waiters are better
dressed than we are.

301
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:08,308
Look at his suit.

302
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,811
(Laughter)

303
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,781
Oh, Rosemary.

304
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,517
Margaux, hi.

305
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,686
- And you must be the husband.
- Guy.

306
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
- Yes.
- Hello.

307
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:22,189
Mwah.

308
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:24,825
- What a gentleman.
- Roman, come.

309
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:28,195
I want you to say hello
to my savior.

310
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:31,398
- Roman, this is...
- The fabulous Rosemary.

311
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,034
Of course it is.
I've heard your name all day.

312
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,203
- Nice to meet... Oh.
- How fabulous

313
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,038
to meet a real superhero
in the flesh.

314
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,406
Hmm.
(Chuckles)

315
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,508
And this is the man set to shake up

316
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:43,077
our English Department,
Guy Woodhouse.

317
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,912
- Wait, how did you...
- Roman.

318
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,914
When Margaux told me
you might come, I was thrilled.

319
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,382
I read your brilliant submission paper

320
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,817
- on Fitzgerald.
- Seriously?

321
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:51,685
- Here we go.
- Now, I make no apologies

322
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,087
for being star-struck.

323
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,155
Excuse us, I'm afraid
I need to monopolize

324
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,390
your husband the whole evening.

325
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:59,093
I'm gonna show the French
what a real intellectual looks like.

326
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:00,661
- Yes. Okay.
- Um... Are you...

327
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:01,895
- Come on.
- Bye.

328
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,370
Over here is someone you must meet.

329
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:05,332
- I'm sorry, my husband...
- No, your home is beautiful.

330
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,700
- Margaux.
- Yes.

331
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:08,602
- Thank you for inviting us.
- I'll be right back.

332
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,204
Okay.

333
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:11,405
Yes?

334
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,476
- A petit-four?
- No thank you.

335
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,512
(Indistinct chatter)

336
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:21,515
(Classical music)

337
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:31,025
- (Murmurs greeting)
- Oh! Bonsoir!

338
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,862
Rosemary, there are no wallflowers
allowed at my parties.

339
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:37,131
You'll have to mingle.

340
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:39,033
Mm.

341
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:41,568
Everybody's just so fascinating.

342
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,470
I don't speak a word of French.

343
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,406
I feel like I...

344
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,375
Da, da, da, da. Come.

345
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,810
S'il vous plait.

346
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,713
In honor of my guest,
Rosemary Woodhouse,

347
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,548
this night of festivities

348
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,717
will now be conducted
in English only.

349
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,018
- No, no, Margaux...
- Yes.

350
00:16:58,053 --> 00:16:59,286
Of course.

351
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,455
Americans are known
to speak just one language.

352
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,791
- (Laughter)
- And French are known to be

353
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,192
arrogant pricks.

354
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,995
I have been called much worse,
Madame Castevet.

355
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,497
- You've met wife, Sylvie.
- No.

356
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,932
- Enchante.
- Enchante.

357
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,901
And thank you for having us.

358
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,302
Such a beautiful home.

359
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:18,205
The secret to a lively party
is new and interesting guests.

360
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,340
It's you two I have
to thank for coming.

361
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,477
Rosemary, this is the man to know
if you're up to any mischief.

362
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,180
Commissioner Fontaine is
the head of police in Paris.

363
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:27,848
Oh. Nice to meet you, sir.

364
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,349
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

365
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,751
- Enchante.
- Rosemary.

366
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:34,121
Madame Castevet told me
your story with the thief.

367
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:36,423
You were brave, but very foolish.

368
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,593
I wish I had a hundred more
like you on the force.

369
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:40,994
(Laughs)

370
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,030
Well, I promise I will
never do it again

371
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:45,432
if you can promise
that I won't ever, ever need to.

372
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,867
(Both laugh)

373
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,869
(Speaking French)
She's exceptional.

374
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,204
Shall we go?

375
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,641
(Both speaking French)

376
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,809
Anything you need, you call me.

377
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:58,011
Thank you, sir.

378
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,314
Madame Veaulieu is the chief designer

379
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:02,950
- of the House of Beauchamps.
- Hello, Rosemary.

380
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:05,552
- You look stunning.
- Thank you. You do too.

381
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,554
Xavier Exharos.
Exharos Shipping.

382
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:08,989
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

383
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:11,659
- Rosemary.
- Oh, Rosemary, come.

384
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:16,897
Monsieur Wees is a master
of rare manuscripts.

385
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:19,233
He's a guiding force
in the preservation

386
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,734
of the dead sea scrolls.

387
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,536
- Don't exaggerate.
- I'm not.

388
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,572
It's very nice to meet you, sir.

389
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,074
- Oh.
- (Laughs)

390
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,578
Behave!

391
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,047
Yoshiro!

392
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,848
Akia Technologies.

393
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,351
Rosemary.

394
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,820
(Laughs)

395
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,989
Can you tell me where
the ladies' room is, please?

396
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:43,924
Yes, down the hall and to the left

397
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,160
- next to the Goya.
- Thank you.

398
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,366
(Overlapping conversations)

399
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,336
When they uncovered the mouth,
they restored the whole piece.

400
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,205
Turns out, he had a rather
self-satisfied grin...

401
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:55,796
What are you doing?

402
00:19:57,432 --> 00:19:58,766
Oh.

403
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:04,004
Hey. You okay?

404
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,740
You're red. What's wrong?

405
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:08,776
No.

406
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:15,716
Can we go home? Now?

407
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,718
Yeah, of course.

408
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,321
Can we please go home?

409
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:36,096
(Classical music in background)

410
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,801
(Laughter)

411
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:46,373
Roman.

412
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,442
Thank you so much
for a lovely evening.

413
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,077
- You're not going yet.
- Yes.

414
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,545
This is Paris.

415
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,060
- (Laughter)
- We're just getting started.

416
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,815
I know.
We really have to get going.

417
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:56,784
Come say good-bye to Margaux.

418
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,118
Okay.

419
00:20:58,153 --> 00:21:00,821
Just two minutes. Come on.

420
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,557
(Indistinct chatter)

421
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:04,792
(Chatter ceases)

422
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:07,227
Making a new friend,
as we all know,

423
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:09,463
is one of the sweetest things in life.

424
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:11,899
And it happens to me
very rarely indeed.

425
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,134
So I hope that
you, Rosemary, and Guy,

426
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:17,171
will allow us to consider you
as new additions

427
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:18,505
to our little clan of misfits.

428
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,974
(Laughter)

429
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:22,643
And as a small token
of our friendship,

430
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:25,512
we'd like to present you
with a small gift.

431
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:26,647
Margaux.

432
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:30,784
Oh.

433
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:32,286
They say one life is not enough

434
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,855
to fully enjoy the pleasures
of this world.

435
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:38,726
We'd like to offer you nine more.

436
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:45,799
- (Cat meows)
- (Rosemary gasps)

437
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:50,671
(Cheers and applause)

438
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:52,773
What kind of people get
complete strangers

439
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:54,341
an animal for a gift?

440
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,710
That's not a gift. It's an obligation.

441
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,179
I think she's beautiful.

442
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,447
What should we name her?

443
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:02,116
Name? No, no, no.

444
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,984
No name.
We're not keeping this cat, Ro.

445
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,553
- Oh, Guy.
- No.

446
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:06,954
Look at her face.

447
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:09,990
Look, there's hardly enough room
in here for the two of us as it is.

448
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:12,918
And I don't think the university
is gonna allow us to have cats anyway.

449
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:14,395
Come here. Come here.

450
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,596
(Cat meows)

451
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,333
What did you think of them?

452
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,501
Them?

453
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:21,856
- Yes.
- What did I think of them?

454
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,203
Uh... I don't know.

455
00:22:23,238 --> 00:22:27,408
I don't want to speak ill
of my fellow clansmen, with a "C."

456
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:29,376
- (Laughs)
- But...

457
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:31,579
Roman... I think he's maybe
one of the most

458
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:34,648
arrogant, obnoxious people
I've ever met in my entire life.

459
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:36,150
And that's just the stuff
I liked about him.

460
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:37,551
Definitely doesn't lack in confidence.

461
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:38,852
Baby, can you help me?

462
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,821
Yeah. Well...

463
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:42,756
He's got enough ego
for the both of us

464
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,692
and the cat.

465
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:47,861
Mm, mm.

466
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,376
He would make
a good character though.

467
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:51,165
He would, right?

468
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,601
- You should put him in your book.
- Yeah.

469
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,903
But then, I would have
to see him again, so no.

470
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:59,940
- I like Margaux.
- Hey...

471
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:03,944
What got you so hot
and bothered in there tonight?

472
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,579
You want to talk about it

473
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:06,914
or do you want to do something
about it?

474
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:08,415
Ooh. Um...

475
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,450
That's a good question.

476
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:10,684
I think...

477
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,853
I think I'd talk about it.

478
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:15,256
What do you think?

479
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,259
(Soft piano music)

480
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,770
- (Cat purrs)
- Oh.

481
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:30,938
We have a friend.

482
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:32,373
(Gasps)
Oh. Honey...

483
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:34,375
You're not gonna give up, are you?

484
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,643
She was meant for us.

485
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:39,213
(Chuckles)

486
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:40,481
You really love her.

487
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,983
I do. I do.

488
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:44,919
Okay.

489
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:50,324
(Cat meows)

490
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:53,561
(Coughs)

491
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:56,597
(Cat meowing)

492
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:02,169
Guy? Guy, wake up.

493
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:05,339
There's smoke.

494
00:24:05,373 --> 00:24:08,509
My God. Okay. Wait here.

495
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:11,245
(Ominous music)

496
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,413
- Be careful.
- I got it.

497
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,281
(Electricity crackles)

498
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:16,817
Aah!

499
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:20,154
- Aah! Guy!
- Aah! Aah!

500
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:21,722
Shh...

501
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:28,295
(Cat meows)

502
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,930
(Speaking French)

503
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:31,799
Huh? I don't speak French.

504
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,301
No animals allowed in the hospital.

505
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:35,803
- No, I know.
- If you want to wait,

506
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,805
- the animal has to go outside.
- No, please.

507
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,140
Listen, my husband,
he's in the burn unit, okay?

508
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:41,976
And it's very cold outside.
I can't put this cat...

509
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,245
Then I'm going to ask
both of you to leave.

510
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,346
- No, please.
- Excusez-moi.

511
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,281
(Both speaking French)

512
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:48,782
We came as soon as we heard.

513
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,651
- Is he hurt badly?
- I don't know.

514
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:51,886
They haven't told me anything.

515
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,555
What are you doing here?
How did you find out that I was here?

516
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:55,956
Commissioner Fontaine
said the police

517
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:57,671
responded to an accident
at your residence.

518
00:24:57,692 --> 00:24:59,493
We wanted to make sure
you were okay.

519
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:00,995
I'm fine.

520
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:02,496
(Sniffles)
It's Guy.

521
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,531
There must have been a short circuit

522
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:07,034
with our hot plate,
and everything caught on fire.

523
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:08,702
And Guy was burned.

524
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:10,805
- Oh, don't worry.
- (Crying)

525
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,173
We're here now.

526
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:14,074
I've already started a prayer for him.

527
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:15,409
I don't like bullies.

528
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:17,244
She's gone to get us some coffee.

529
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,779
- And the cat stays.
- It's okay, baby.

530
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:20,814
Thank you.

531
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,550
Did you hear that, baby?

532
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:25,319
No Name, she saved us.

533
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:27,388
She was the one that woke us up.

534
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:30,558
- You named her "No Name"?
- Guy did.

535
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:31,992
That's quite the imagination
for a writer.

536
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:34,161
- (Chuckles)
- Mrs. Woodhouse.

537
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,230
Yes, doctor. Thank you so much.

538
00:25:36,264 --> 00:25:37,998
How is he?

539
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,734
From the description of the accident,
I expected much greater trauma.

540
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,369
Your husband suffered
second degree burns,

541
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:44,605
but he seems to have escaped
any permanent damage.

542
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,173
He should be released within the hour.

543
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,875
Okay. Merci.

544
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,111
- Oh...(Murmuring)
- (Sniffles)

545
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:53,013
It's okay. It's okay.

546
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,849
- Hey.
- Oh.

547
00:25:54,883 --> 00:25:56,350
He's gonna be fine.

548
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:58,018
They're gonna release him
in an hour.

549
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,520
Oh, thank God.

550
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:01,855
These are...
these are our new friends.

551
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,390
- Margaux and Roman.
- Hi.

552
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:05,626
- This is Julie.
- How do you do, Julie?

553
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,027
Hi.

554
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:08,796
So, where are you going
to live now?

555
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,031
You obviously can't go back
to that place.

556
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:12,633
I haven't had a second
to think about that.

557
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:13,734
You can stay with me.

558
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,903
I've got a sofa and an air bed.

559
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:17,438
You'll be fine.

560
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,773
We have an empty apartment
at La Chimere.

561
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:21,141
- (Cat meows)
- No.

562
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:24,378
I don't think you realize how much
an English professor makes in a month.

563
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,614
But we couldn't even afford
your building

564
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:28,782
- for a weekend.
- We own it.

565
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:30,784
We charge whatever we want.

566
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:32,887
It's just sitting there empty
waiting to be burgled.

567
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:34,255
Really, you'd be doing us a favor.

568
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:36,156
You can pay the same rent
you pay now,

569
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,491
and we'd be in profit.

570
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:38,659
It's a win-win.

571
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,896
- That's insane.
- (Cat meows)

572
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,397
- Julie...
- (Laughs)

573
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:45,599
What she means is
it's very generous of you.

574
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:48,169
- (Cat meows)
- Yeah. That's what I meant.

575
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:51,105
(Cheerful music)

576
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:58,412
(Music in French)

577
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:06,687
Ahh!

578
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,622
(Laughs)

579
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:12,427
Closets.

580
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,136
- Guy!
- Yeah?

581
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:26,507
You're not gonna believe this.

582
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:36,150
- What?
- This is unexpected.

583
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,453
Are you...

584
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:43,391
Ro, look at this.

585
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:45,360
It's a perfect fit.

586
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:47,395
(Laughs)

587
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:49,263
(Gasps)
Look, there's more.

588
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,834
This... this all can't be for us.

589
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,869
Well, it's either that
or the last tenants

590
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:57,472
were exactly the same size.

591
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,507
- (Laughs)
- Guy.

592
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:01,075
These clothes are brand-new.

593
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,177
They all the tags on them.

594
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:06,714
Ooh.
(Clicks tongue)

595
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:08,216
That's creepy.

596
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,484
Well, yeah.

597
00:28:09,518 --> 00:28:12,186
But, I mean, you could try it on
just once for kicks.

598
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,389
- I'm kidding, sort of.
- No.

599
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:16,157
- Not at all.
- Seriously.

600
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,225
I know.

601
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:20,194
I know that this was done
with the best of intentions,

602
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:21,429
but it's too much.

603
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:23,031
Ro, look.

604
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:24,999
It's temporary, okay?

605
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:27,001
I promise. We won't have
to take anything from them.

606
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:28,703
From now on, we eat our food,

607
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:30,405
we wear our own clothes,

608
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,540
and then if I sell my book...

609
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,776
When you sell your book.

610
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,677
We get our own place.

611
00:28:36,712 --> 00:28:41,049
Yes.

612
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,817
Mwah. Okay.

613
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:45,420
- (Rosemary laughs)
- All right.

614
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:47,555
It's slick.

615
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:49,357
Don't get lost in here.

616
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:10,144
Look who's excited to see you.

617
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,879
- (Cat meows)
- It's great

618
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:14,749
seeing how many times
I can write the same paragraph.

619
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:16,818
- Hmm, let me see.
- No.

620
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:18,586
It's nothing.

621
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,655
Baby, you're putting too much
pressure on yourself.

622
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:23,591
Or not enough.

623
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,561
This starving artist thing
is getting old, Ro.

624
00:29:26,595 --> 00:29:29,163
It's about time I started
taking care of our family.

625
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:32,967
You do take care of us.

626
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:36,404
- Us.
- Yeah.

627
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:38,439
(Cat meows)

628
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:46,314
(Distant baby crying)

629
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:10,638
Aah!

630
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:12,674
(Scream echoes)

631
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:22,717
(Ominous music)

632
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,811
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

633
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:39,347
- How are you?
- I'm good.

634
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:40,815
- Good.
- Is this where you work?

635
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,817
I know. Amazing.

636
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:44,953
- I'm so lucky.
- Julie, it's beautiful.

637
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,655
So how's it going at La Chimere?

638
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:47,956
Oh...

639
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,157
I hear Mick Jagger has an apartment.

640
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,559
- (Laughs)
- Or is it David Bowie?

641
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:53,395
I haven't seen either one of them.

642
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,364
Though I wouldn't mind to bump
into them in the elevator.

643
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,633
Did Guy tell you
I put him up for a new job?

644
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:01,703
- No.
- Yeah, the post just opened up.

645
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,304
What's the position?

646
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,073
Oh, head of the
English Literature Department.

647
00:31:05,107 --> 00:31:08,710
Yeah, it'd be a lot more money,
plus the prestige.

648
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,011
Well, Guy doesn't care
about the money.

649
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:13,048
He just wants to finish the book.

650
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:16,251
He's had a really hard time.

651
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:20,121
I think ever since the miscarriage,
he's had writer's block.

652
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:24,426
He just needs a new muse.

653
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,827
Oh, don't worry, honey.

654
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,829
Your husband never had
a wandering eye.

655
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:29,664
Not after he met you.

656
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:32,067
You're sweet.

657
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,436
Ooh. That's Guy's main competition.

658
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,371
Professor Hildegard Bishop.

659
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,006
Mm. Sounds so severe.

660
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,009
Oh, yeah. She's an uptight prig.

661
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,211
Very well published though.

662
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:45,547
(Cell phone chimes)

663
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:47,582
Sorry.

664
00:31:48,651 --> 00:31:50,485
Uh...

665
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,253
Where do you want to eat?

666
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:55,657
Cafeteria or my office?

667
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:01,029
Oh!

668
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,321
Back so soon?

669
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:31,927
Yes, I didn't have much
on my list today.

670
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,600
(Gasps)

671
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:14,169
(Both scream)

672
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:16,371
Don't be afraid, Rosemary!

673
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:18,455
This is Emile,
the handyman for the building.

674
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,775
- What?
- Forgive his lack of eloquence.

675
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,777
He was born without a tongue.
It's my fault.

676
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:24,779
I haven't called for
a handyman, Margaux.

677
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:26,014
I know.

678
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:27,349
We had an issue with our fireplace.

679
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:29,985
And I thought we should check yours
while he was engaged.

680
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:32,520
(Speaking French)

681
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:34,389
- (Groans) No, no.
- Oh, God.

682
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:35,457
C'est bizarre.

683
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:40,462
(Speaking French)

684
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:44,299
I know he's scary. Sorry.

685
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,567
Margaux, please.

686
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:49,070
You have to notify me before
you let anybody into my apartment.

687
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,573
I... This can be such a fright.

688
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,174
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:55,810
I thought my husband told
your husband yesterday.

690
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:57,746
Maybe Guy forgot to tell me.

691
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,481
I'm sorry.

692
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:00,682
So now we're both sorry.

693
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:02,817
Oh, God.

694
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:05,487
What's wrong?

695
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:08,356
I just have a really bad
headache after the scare.

696
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:09,591
Come.

697
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:10,925
Come with me.

698
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,428
Come.

699
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:14,829
Lie on the bed

700
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:16,831
with your head on that side,

701
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:20,268
- and your feet up there.
- Like this?

702
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:23,238
Mm-hmm.

703
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,507
Sorry.

704
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:28,843
I learned this in Tibet.

705
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,113
For all our hubris,

706
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:34,582
so much ignorance remains

707
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:38,119
in western healing.

708
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:44,559
Wait.

709
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:46,261
Don't move. Don't move, don't move.

710
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,363
Stay there.

711
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:49,864
(Eerie music)

712
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:52,100
Close your eyes.

713
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,602
Take a deep breath.

714
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:57,639
Hold it in your chest.

715
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:03,611
Now exhale.

716
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:06,648
Slowly.

717
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:18,893
It's gone.

718
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:19,928
Mm-hmm.

719
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:22,430
How did you...

720
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,247
How can I ever repay you?
Thank you.

721
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:42,851
You can wear one of
the dresses in your closet.

722
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:46,655
I spent a lot of time picking them.

723
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,860
Now you relax.

724
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,529
I'll let myself out.

725
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,204
There's no fireplace in this room.

726
00:36:07,877 --> 00:36:10,111
Guy!

727
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:12,714
Can I offer you a ride?

728
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:14,616
Yeah, I speak like a writer.

729
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,787
I think like a writer,
but I just can't actually write

730
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:20,722
my own words.

731
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:22,390
Ah.

732
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,326
Well, maybe this
teaching job's distracting you.

733
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,530
Maybe if I had
a better job or more money,

734
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:31,399
then I wouldn't have
to worry about it so much.

735
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:33,568
I'm never going to be able to provide

736
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:37,305
my wife with the life
that she deserves.

737
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,074
Maybe we can help you.

738
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:40,475
(Taps glass)
Pierre.

739
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:43,511
The club, please.

740
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:47,315
- (Object shatters)
- Damn it.

741
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,318
What was he doing in here?

742
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:51,820
Come on. Come on. Uhh!

743
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:54,522
What were you hiding?

744
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:58,460
Damn it!

745
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:08,403
(Eerie music)

746
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:18,268
You want to know the secret?

747
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:19,848
- To what?
- To success.

748
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:22,083
- Yeah.
- In order to be a success,

749
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:25,353
everyone needs to find
two special people.

750
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:27,789
My first was Margaux.

751
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:29,591
She made me whole.

752
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,360
Yeah. That's what Rosemary does.

753
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,763
I know.

754
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:36,631
The other was my benefactor,

755
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:37,932
who made me who I am.

756
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,434
Your benefactor? Who's that?

757
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:40,869
Doesn't matter who mine was.

758
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:42,537
Yours will be a different person.

759
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:45,106
You have to find them.

760
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:48,043
You have to ask them.

761
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:53,815
They'll guide you and help you realize
all your dreams.

762
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:59,387
'Cause they are possible, Guy.
All of them.

763
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:03,258
And you deserve it, don't you?

764
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:04,960
I really do.

765
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:06,461
You really do.

766
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,296
(Laughter, clink glasses)

767
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:09,464
(Door closes)

768
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,499
(Rosemary grunts)

769
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:16,571
Come on.
(Grunts)

770
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:19,140
- Uh... Uhh!
- Ro?

771
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:20,742
(Rosemary panting)

772
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:23,144
- Are you okay?
- Can you help me with this?

773
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:25,647
- Help me move this.
- What is going on?

774
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,816
Look.
There's a molding.

775
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,684
Behind the armoire,
there's a hidden door.

776
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,453
- Babe, come on.
- Just help me.

777
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:32,854
(Groans)

778
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:34,489
Okay, just stop. Careful, all right?

779
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:35,790
Hey. Come here.

780
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:43,031
Okay, that's it, that's it,
that's it, that's good.

781
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:46,167
I told you.

782
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:56,478
It's just a closet
that they were hiding?

783
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:01,683
Ro?

784
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:04,119
Hey, Ro.

785
00:39:04,153 --> 00:39:07,122
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

786
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:11,026
What were you talking
about with Roman yesterday?

787
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,128
What? When?

788
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:14,563
I saw you at the school.

789
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:17,032
I was there visiting Julie,
and I saw you and Roman.

790
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:18,266
What were you guys talking about?

791
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:21,570
Rosemary, you gotta stop.

792
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:23,672
You're acting paranoid, okay?

793
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:26,074
- Come on.
- You're right.

794
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:29,077
Come on. Help me clean this up.

795
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,580
What did you do?

796
00:39:47,897 --> 00:39:49,898
Standing here.

797
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:53,935
Here.

798
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,705
It's the exact spot
when they took this picture.

799
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:00,508
Rosemary. You're obsessed.

800
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:01,576
What are you wearing?

801
00:40:01,611 --> 00:40:03,245
- Guy...
- Okay, yes.

802
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:04,679
I know what I said, but I just...

803
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:05,780
I want to look good
for this interview.

804
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:06,948
That's all.

805
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:08,550
Is that what you really want?

806
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:10,252
To be the head
of the English Department?

807
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:12,821
It would almost double my salary, Ro.

808
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,122
I know.

809
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:16,391
I just... I thought you wanted
to finish your novel.

810
00:40:16,425 --> 00:40:18,727
Those who can't do teach, right?

811
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:22,197
Besides, I don't have
a publisher anymore, so...

812
00:40:22,231 --> 00:40:24,266
What are you talking about?

813
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:31,406
They called yesterday.
They cancelled my contract.

814
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,441
What?

815
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,381
What happened?

816
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:40,949
- What did they say?
- I don't know.

817
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,484
I don't know what's going on with me.

818
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:45,420
It's like my brain is stuck
in molasses.

819
00:40:45,454 --> 00:40:48,557
It was never easy to write,
but it was always possible, you know?

820
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:49,925
No.

821
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:53,428
Every writer gets writer's block
at some point in their career.

822
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:54,629
It's temporary.

823
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,498
Yeah, well, the problem is

824
00:40:56,532 --> 00:40:57,833
that I was counting on
selling that book

825
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:00,769
for you and me,
so now this interview

826
00:41:00,803 --> 00:41:05,674
has suddenly become a white-knuckle,
balls-in-a-vice type situation.

827
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,676
Oh, and Ro,

828
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,912
I wouldn't mention that picture
to anybody.

829
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,581
- Why?
- (Laughs)

830
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:15,750
You just... you went
a little nuts last night.

831
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:18,787
That's all.

832
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:29,649
By the way, I like the new you.

833
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,257
I thought you liked the old me.

834
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,725
Well, I did. But this is better.

835
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,994
More confident. More manly.

836
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:37,930
Yeah. Hey, listen.

837
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,832
Do you think I really have a chance?

838
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:41,500
You'd be perfect for the job.

839
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,169
You're a much better teacher.

840
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,037
She's tedious.

841
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:46,072
Good luck.

842
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:49,075
Thanks.

843
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:54,814
(Clattering)

844
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:55,848
Sorry.

845
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,185
- (Cat meows)
- Hey.

846
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:00,953
Come here.

847
00:42:00,988 --> 00:42:03,956
Mm. Baby.

848
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,791
How are you, hmm?

849
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:06,826
(Kisses)

850
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:15,874
(Muffled chanting)

851
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:20,373
(Cat meows)

852
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,476
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

853
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,744
(Cat meows)

854
00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:26,746
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

855
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,322
(Chanting continues)

856
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:38,624
(Laughter)

857
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,926
Credentials are impeccable.

858
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:44,263
Of course, your publications
are impressive.

859
00:42:44,297 --> 00:42:47,433
But I wonder how they will
apply to the class?

860
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:51,637
After all,
we must engage the students,

861
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:54,373
not entertain them.

862
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:57,243
Grab their attention
and keep it, so to say.

863
00:42:57,277 --> 00:42:59,011
I agree with everything you say.

864
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,914
Even though every student is unique,

865
00:43:01,948 --> 00:43:04,850
it is my responsibility
that each student reaches

866
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:06,919
their full potential.

867
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:09,789
The position is head of the depart...

868
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,991
(Voice distorts)
I think you'll find the...

869
00:43:12,025 --> 00:43:14,260
(voice repeating, echoing)
salary is appropriate

870
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:16,362
for the job's responsibilities.

871
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:19,398
(Static, buzzing)

872
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:26,639
(Buzzing echoes)

873
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:37,483
God!

874
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:41,120
(Buzzing continues loudly)

875
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,827
(Groans)

876
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:54,033
(Groans)

877
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:55,568
(Thud)

878
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:04,977
- (Panting)
- (Woman screams)

879
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:08,047
(Commotion, chatter)

880
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,315
Oh, my God.

881
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,450
Compress. Compress tight, okay?

882
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,520
- Call the police now!
- Call the police!

883
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:28,701
So, Dr. Carraro is going to be okay.

884
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:31,837
I guess the scissors didn't
reach any vital organs.

885
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:34,173
That's good news.

886
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:36,442
Do you have any idea what happened?

887
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:38,110
No.

888
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,112
I never thought
Professor Bishop was capable

889
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,247
of anything like that.

890
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:42,615
I mean, she wasn't so much fun,

891
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:45,418
but to have a psychotic break?

892
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:50,189
I guess you never really
know what's hidden

893
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:53,793
inside somebody's heart.

894
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,928
Listen, I probably
shouldn't be saying this,

895
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:59,899
but this is good for you.

896
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:02,735
- Julie, don't.
- I mean it.

897
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:05,404
It's sick, but now you're
the best candidate for the job.

898
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:08,274
I can't think about what I stand to gain
from something like this.

899
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:09,709
- It's...
- Guy, stop it.

900
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:12,812
It's not your fault.
You had nothing to do with it.

901
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:15,715
She was bipolar,
or on drugs or whatever.

902
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:19,752
(Crowd murmurs)

903
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:29,662
Guy, you okay?

904
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:31,497
I don't understand.

905
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:33,232
Do you know them?
Are they missing?

906
00:45:33,267 --> 00:45:35,534
No, I don't know anything about them.

907
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:41,073
But you have suspicions
they were met with foul play.

908
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:44,310
Yes.

909
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:46,345
That's in our apartment.

910
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,948
You see, this is our bedroom.

911
00:45:48,982 --> 00:45:50,283
That's where they took the picture.

912
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:52,551
It's morning.
And they do look very happy,

913
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:54,186
but every time I look at the picture

914
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,489
and I see her eyes, I just get
a bad feeling, you know?

915
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:59,025
You have an entire life
imagined for them

916
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:01,427
from this single snapshot.

917
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:03,863
Yes.

918
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,867
(Chuckles)

919
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:10,603
It's a little crazy, right?

920
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,538
I'm really sorry.

921
00:46:12,572 --> 00:46:14,974
Did you talk to Madame Castevet?

922
00:46:15,008 --> 00:46:18,544
She might know the whereabouts
of this mysterious couple.

923
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:20,346
She didn't want to talk about it.

924
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,550
Do you feel she was hiding something?

925
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:29,488
You don't want to disparage
anyone without evidence.

926
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:32,992
You're a kind and loyal friend.

927
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:35,695
Let's check if there might be
any police activity

928
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:39,398
reported at your address.

929
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:42,435
Just a moment.

930
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,242
(Speaking French)

931
00:46:57,584 --> 00:47:00,753
Hmm.

932
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:02,955
- I'm sorry.
- Nothing?

933
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,759
The woman in the picture is dead.

934
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:08,861
Her name was Nena Pascal.

935
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:12,498
Egyptian born, no family in France.

936
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:15,768
Preliminary report indicates
she jumped from the balcony

937
00:47:15,802 --> 00:47:17,169
of her bedroom to her death.

938
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:18,704
My bedroom?

939
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,173
Her husband, Jacques,
confirmed her suicide.

940
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,908
Ah.

941
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:25,845
It appears that he missed
an appointment for questioning.

942
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,347
He's presently missing.

943
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:31,784
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

944
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:36,388
You should always listen
to your feelings, Rosemary.

945
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,517
Guy?

946
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,929
__

947
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:26,185
"Put on the dress."

948
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,591
Guy?

949
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,564
- Surprise!
- (Shrieks)

950
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:39,565
(Laughter)

951
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,669
The belle of the ball has arrived.
The party can get started.

952
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:44,804
What a surprise.
(Laughs)

953
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,074
Your lovely husband is the new head
of the English Literature Department

954
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:50,176
- at the Sorbonne.
- (Crowd oohs and ahhs)

955
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,312
And I made the mistake
of telling Roman,

956
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,346
so here we all are.

957
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,714
This was their idea.

958
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:57,784
Life is to be celebrated, particularly
when good things happen to good people.

959
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:00,219
So, raise your glasses,
ladies and gentlemen,

960
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:03,890
to the meteoric rise
of Professor Guy Woodhouse.

961
00:49:03,924 --> 00:49:05,758
ALL:
Cheers.

962
00:49:05,793 --> 00:49:07,994
- Thank you.
- Cheers, baby.

963
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,430
(Speaking French)

964
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:12,932
Congratulations.

965
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,401
I hope this is everything
you wanted, baby.

966
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:18,838
Not exactly.

967
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,873
Come here.

968
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:23,877
(Background chatter)

969
00:49:27,915 --> 00:49:29,549
When did...

970
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,185
Come here.

971
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,187
You don't know anyone at all,
do you, darling?

972
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,190
- No.
- Come.

973
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,359
(Chatter, dinner music)

974
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,194
What? What is it?

975
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,296
(Exhales)

976
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,131
I think we should try again.

977
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:47,667
Try what?

978
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:49,869
I want to make a baby.

979
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,571
I know. I know.

980
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:52,772
- I know it's scary.
- Guy...

981
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:54,874
- I know.
- It may be too soon.

982
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,150
Don't you feel how different
everything is here though?

983
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:58,645
I do feel different.

984
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:00,146
They feel right.
Things are happening

985
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,414
the way they were supposed to.

986
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:02,649
What if it's too soon?

987
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:06,386
Baby, I think we need to.

988
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,591
It's time.

989
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,661
Right?

990
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,796
Yeah?

991
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,133
(Laughs)

992
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:22,068
Okay.

993
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,938
What's going on?

994
00:50:24,972 --> 00:50:27,473
Let me guess.

995
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:30,143
- You're pregnant.
- No.

996
00:50:30,177 --> 00:50:32,145
I swear to God,
I didn't say anything to her.

997
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:35,281
It's okay.
But I'm... We're gonna try.

998
00:50:35,316 --> 00:50:36,883
- (Squeals)
- (Laughs)

999
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,652
- No, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1000
00:50:39,687 --> 00:50:41,287
Margaux, please. No more gifts.

1001
00:50:41,322 --> 00:50:43,256
I can't... can't bear it.

1002
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,426
It's not a frivolous thing,
like a dress.

1003
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,696
- This is serious.
- What is it?

1004
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,199
It's a family heirloom
filled with tannis root

1005
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:55,134
from my greenhouse.

1006
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:57,437
It's beautiful.

1007
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,871
It's pungent.

1008
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:01,274
It's actually quite powerful.

1009
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:05,678
It's there to protect you
and the baby soon to be inside you.

1010
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:08,579
Promise me you'll wear it.

1011
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:11,818
I promise.

1012
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,853
Thank you. Thank you.

1013
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,490
Thank you, Margaux.

1014
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:56,095
Aah!

1015
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,064
(Thud)

1016
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:01,301
(Gasping)

1017
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:28,194
What are you doing?

1018
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:31,364
Writing my book.

1019
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,433
It's 3:00 in the morning.

1020
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:35,034
It's coming, Rosemary.

1021
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,103
The words, all of it. It's coming.

1022
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:40,273
It's like a spigot has opened up.

1023
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:42,308
(Laughs)

1024
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:45,945
So you're not just falling.

1025
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,614
He's pushing you off the building.

1026
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:50,316
Yes. And it's very disturbing.

1027
00:52:50,351 --> 00:52:52,619
You know, maybe you should rethink
this whole getting pregnant thing.

1028
00:52:52,653 --> 00:52:54,087
Hmm?
No.

1029
00:52:54,121 --> 00:52:55,822
What are you talking about?
I'm ready.

1030
00:52:55,856 --> 00:52:57,624
I've started charting my cycle.

1031
00:52:57,658 --> 00:52:59,392
I'm ovulating next week.

1032
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,227
Yeah, but think about your dream.

1033
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:02,595
I mean, it's so obvious.

1034
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,831
You falling means you're anxious,

1035
00:53:04,865 --> 00:53:06,733
you're afraid of losing control.

1036
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,502
And Guy pushing you
means exactly that.

1037
00:53:09,537 --> 00:53:12,672
I mean, what did he pressure
you into recently

1038
00:53:12,706 --> 00:53:15,275
at a party in front
of your new friends?

1039
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:17,310
No.

1040
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:20,346
I think I know what it's about.

1041
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:25,184
A couple? I don't get it.

1042
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:28,588
Is Guy pushing you into swinging?

1043
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,590
Very funny.

1044
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,792
This is Jacques and Nena.

1045
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:34,460
They were the couple that lived
in our apartment

1046
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:36,329
before we did.

1047
00:53:36,363 --> 00:53:38,665
She died three months ago.

1048
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,300
In the apartment.

1049
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:43,469
She either jumped
or she was pushed off

1050
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:45,605
the balcony of our bedroom.

1051
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,307
That's creepy.

1052
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:50,643
Maybe my dream was a sign,
a message.

1053
00:53:50,678 --> 00:53:53,546
You think Guy is trying to kill you.

1054
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:55,014
Of course not.

1055
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:57,217
Well, yeah. Of course not.

1056
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:59,052
I just feel like
whatever that dream meant,

1057
00:53:59,086 --> 00:54:04,057
she had the answer,
and I'll never know because she's dead.

1058
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:06,993
Oh, well, maybe you can go
and talk to her friends.

1059
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:09,896
I don't know anything about her.
How would I know to find her friends?

1060
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,198
Okay, look. You see this?

1061
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:14,734
That's a symbol for Coptic Christians.

1062
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:16,236
- Coptic?
- Yeah.

1063
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,938
There's only one Coptic church
in Paris.

1064
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,275
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1065
00:54:26,573 --> 00:54:30,642
(Bells tolling)

1066
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:37,249
(Solemn music and singing)

1067
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:47,426
(Man whispering)

1068
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,496
Pardon.

1069
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:56,068
(Electronic voice speaks in French)

1070
00:54:56,102 --> 00:54:58,604
Do you know her?

1071
00:54:58,638 --> 00:55:00,639
(Speaking French)

1072
00:55:22,962 --> 00:55:25,697
Follow me, please.

1073
00:55:25,732 --> 00:55:28,934
- Are you a friend of Nena's?
- No.

1074
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:31,804
But I want to know more about her.

1075
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:34,139
She died.

1076
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:37,042
Three months ago.

1077
00:55:37,076 --> 00:55:40,279
Father, I'm trying to find out why.

1078
00:55:40,313 --> 00:55:41,947
I know why.

1079
00:55:41,981 --> 00:55:44,917
Nena was consorting with Satanists.

1080
00:55:44,951 --> 00:55:49,588
She lived in an unholy place.
La Chimere.

1081
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:52,291
Wait, that's where I live.

1082
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:53,959
La Chimere.

1083
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:56,495
What do you know about its past?

1084
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:57,996
I looked up its history online,

1085
00:55:58,031 --> 00:56:00,232
and it said that it was built
in the 1860s

1086
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:03,302
and that it was exclusive
for the rich and famous.

1087
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:07,239
Did the computer tell you
about the Trench sisters?

1088
00:56:07,273 --> 00:56:08,907
They lived there in 1933.

1089
00:56:08,942 --> 00:56:11,009
No. Were they famous?

1090
00:56:11,044 --> 00:56:12,911
Infamous.

1091
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:15,948
They were cannibals.

1092
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:27,759
(Overlapping chatter)

1093
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,103
They slaughtered countless men
and served them to their friends

1094
00:56:38,138 --> 00:56:41,640
before they were caught
and hanged for their crimes.

1095
00:56:41,674 --> 00:56:43,108
It's a horrible story.

1096
00:56:43,143 --> 00:56:44,910
It's not the only one.

1097
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:46,845
Terrible things
have happened ever since

1098
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,615
La Chimere rose from the ground.

1099
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:52,618
- The building is cursed.
- Father...

1100
00:56:52,652 --> 00:56:55,721
Steven Marcato lived there until 1986.

1101
00:56:55,755 --> 00:56:57,389
Who's Steven Marcato?

1102
00:56:57,423 --> 00:57:01,026
He was a Satanist,
maybe Satan himself.

1103
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,861
- What is this?
- Fortune Magazine.

1104
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:04,997
How do you think he's so successful?

1105
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:07,232
The Devil hides behind his billions.

1106
00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:09,568
Why do you believe
he's this great evil?

1107
00:57:09,602 --> 00:57:14,039
I saw him in an alley
behind La Chimere.

1108
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:17,075
He sacrificed a whore.

1109
00:57:18,912 --> 00:57:22,181
(Woman murmuring)

1110
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
(Groans)

1111
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,059
(Groaning)

1112
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:41,700
Marcato killed her and ate her heart.

1113
00:57:48,141 --> 00:57:52,177
It says here he's the founder
of the Delphi Group

1114
00:57:52,212 --> 00:57:54,012
and he gives millions to charity.

1115
00:57:54,047 --> 00:57:56,515
The Devil who has many faces.

1116
00:57:56,549 --> 00:58:01,220
You never know what shape
it is going to take.

1117
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:05,858
Steven Marcato one day,
someone else the next.

1118
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:07,960
I've wasted too much of your time.

1119
00:58:07,994 --> 00:58:09,461
Thank you so much for...

1120
00:58:09,496 --> 00:58:10,763
You don't believe me!

1121
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:14,800
Nena didn't believe me either,
and look what happened to her.

1122
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:15,834
Take my advice.

1123
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:18,237
Leave everything behind,
all your worldly possessions,

1124
00:58:18,271 --> 00:58:20,305
everyone you know, leave here!

1125
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,509
Leave here and disappear
before they find you!

1126
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:53,138
Well?

1127
00:58:53,173 --> 00:58:56,141
It's the best work you've ever done.

1128
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:58,177
It's wonderful.

1129
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:00,279
- Really? Really?
- No.

1130
00:59:00,313 --> 00:59:02,014
No, these are not tears in my eyes.

1131
00:59:02,048 --> 00:59:03,582
I'm not moved by the story,

1132
00:59:03,616 --> 00:59:05,250
or your brilliant, magical words.

1133
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:07,619
It was beautiful.

1134
00:59:07,654 --> 00:59:09,154
Thank God.
(Laughs)

1135
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:10,823
Roman really loved it too.

1136
00:59:10,857 --> 00:59:12,591
He said he's gonna take it
to his publisher.

1137
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,359
You gave it to Roman?

1138
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:16,762
Yeah. I mean, I had to.
If it weren't for him,

1139
00:59:16,796 --> 00:59:17,830
I wouldn't have written it, right?

1140
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:19,264
He's practically my muse.

1141
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:21,300
I've been replaced by a man.

1142
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:24,837
Hey. I still think about you
in my private time.

1143
00:59:24,871 --> 00:59:26,538
Baby, I'm proud of you.

1144
00:59:26,573 --> 00:59:32,277
You finished this.
You did it all by yourself.

1145
00:59:32,312 --> 00:59:35,314
I'm gonna go call him.

1146
00:59:41,154 --> 00:59:44,690
(Whispering, indistinct voices)

1147
00:59:55,969 --> 01:00:01,340
(Whispering voices chanting)

1148
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:34,015
Wait.

1149
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:36,050
Wait!

1150
01:00:40,956 --> 01:00:43,958
Wait, stop!

1151
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:55,770
Paul.

1152
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:57,839
Did you see a man come out
of the elevator?

1153
01:00:57,873 --> 01:00:59,507
- No. No.
- Just now?

1154
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:00,942
Really, there wasn't a man?

1155
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:03,978
No. Anything wrong?

1156
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:11,186
No.

1157
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:15,623
(Exhales)

1158
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:22,730
Okay, so you, like,
you don't write poetry?

1159
01:01:22,765 --> 01:01:24,799
No, I did when I was your age.

1160
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,235
But, you know...
(Laughs, murmurs)

1161
01:01:27,269 --> 01:01:28,590
That was a great paper by the way.

1162
01:01:28,604 --> 01:01:29,604
- Yeah, great work.
- Thank you.

1163
01:01:29,638 --> 01:01:31,105
Keep it up.

1164
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,874
Well, ladies, make sure to do

1165
01:01:32,908 --> 01:01:34,542
- the reading for tomorrow.
- We will.

1166
01:01:34,577 --> 01:01:36,144
- Bye.
- Bye.

1167
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:39,113
It feels good when everything
goes your way, huh?

1168
01:01:39,148 --> 01:01:41,249
Yeah, sure.

1169
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:42,550
But, you know, pretty soon,

1170
01:01:42,585 --> 01:01:44,552
it will feel quite natural to you,

1171
01:01:44,587 --> 01:01:46,054
to always be on top.

1172
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:47,789
It's addictive.

1173
01:01:47,823 --> 01:01:50,391
And you'll find yourself doing
anything to stay there.

1174
01:01:50,426 --> 01:01:52,160
Do you make a habit out of this,

1175
01:01:52,194 --> 01:01:55,263
just walking next to strangers,
talking total nonsense?

1176
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:58,166
It's an art.
The seduction, you know.

1177
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,901
(Laughs)
All right, I'm sorry, man.

1178
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,736
I don't have any money.

1179
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,072
But nothing comes without a price.

1180
01:02:04,106 --> 01:02:06,307
You know that.

1181
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:08,676
All right, I'm not having
this conversation

1182
01:02:08,711 --> 01:02:09,978
with a total stranger.

1183
01:02:10,012 --> 01:02:12,914
Who are you?

1184
01:02:12,948 --> 01:02:15,383
I am you.

1185
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:17,385
(Bells tolling)

1186
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:19,787
Wait.

1187
01:02:19,822 --> 01:02:21,823
Hey!

1188
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,442
Professor.

1189
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:42,477
Everything all right?

1190
01:02:42,478 --> 01:02:43,678
Who was that?

1191
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:45,647
Oh, um,

1192
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:48,216
a student.

1193
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,651
Well, I have news.

1194
01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:51,719
They, uh, they read the book.

1195
01:02:51,754 --> 01:02:54,622
And, uh...

1196
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:57,125
They loved it.

1197
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:00,962
They'd like to meet today
if that's okay with you.

1198
01:03:00,996 --> 01:03:03,665
(Both laugh)

1199
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:07,068
Come on.

1200
01:03:07,102 --> 01:03:09,103
(Doorbell rings)

1201
01:03:12,074 --> 01:03:13,541
- Commissioner?
- Hi.

1202
01:03:13,576 --> 01:03:17,178
What a surprise. Come in, come in.

1203
01:03:17,213 --> 01:03:19,047
Is there anything wrong?

1204
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:21,883
I have something to ask you.

1205
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:25,687
What did you do yesterday?

1206
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:27,989
I had a class at La Toque Blanche,

1207
01:03:28,023 --> 01:03:30,758
and then after that,
I went to church.

1208
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:32,260
Why?

1209
01:03:32,294 --> 01:03:35,496
Because I needed spiritual guidance.

1210
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:39,868
Father Tekem was found hanged
last night.

1211
01:03:41,637 --> 01:03:44,639
Now why did you go see him?

1212
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:50,178
I wanted to ask him about Nena.

1213
01:03:50,212 --> 01:03:52,247
What did he say to you?

1214
01:03:52,281 --> 01:03:54,048
He said a lot of crazy things.

1215
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:57,752
He said that cannibals
lived in this building

1216
01:03:57,786 --> 01:03:59,387
as well as Devil worshippers

1217
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:02,423
and that he saw
Steve Marcato commit murder.

1218
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:03,858
- Oh?
- Steve Marcato...

1219
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:05,960
he's a... he's a billionaire.

1220
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:08,296
He said he saw him eat
the heart of a prostitute.

1221
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,332
I thought he was
out of his mind, so I left.

1222
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:18,973
Steven Marcato?
Look what comes up.

1223
01:04:19,008 --> 01:04:21,910
Many strange images.

1224
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:32,187
Do you think it's a coincidence,

1225
01:04:32,221 --> 01:04:34,956
or do you think his death
has something to do with Nena?

1226
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:36,391
I don't know.

1227
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:40,128
But this is no purse snatcher,
Rosemary.

1228
01:04:40,162 --> 01:04:43,965
You need to let this go
and let the police do their jobs.

1229
01:04:43,999 --> 01:04:47,702
Be careful where you place
your trust.

1230
01:04:53,342 --> 01:04:56,978
I've never seen
what you're doing to that chicken

1231
01:04:57,012 --> 01:04:59,113
in any of my cooking classes.

1232
01:04:59,148 --> 01:05:02,150
Because I'm brewing medicine.

1233
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:06,321
(Sawing sounds)

1234
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:10,091
I see you're not wearing the amulet.

1235
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:13,528
I didn't feel like wearing it today.

1236
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:15,497
What is this medicine?

1237
01:05:15,531 --> 01:05:18,266
Fertility soup.

1238
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,869
You drink it after it simmers

1239
01:05:20,903 --> 01:05:24,439
for 12 hours in the clay pot.

1240
01:05:24,473 --> 01:05:25,607
Does it taste good?

1241
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:27,609
No. Terrible.

1242
01:05:27,643 --> 01:05:31,146
But it will make you ready
to have a baby.

1243
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,517
I learned this from the Chinese.

1244
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:38,319
I have a friend, Shui Fa,

1245
01:05:38,354 --> 01:05:42,390
she had to flee China
after the Communist Revolution.

1246
01:05:42,424 --> 01:05:43,791
She was desperate to have a child

1247
01:05:43,826 --> 01:05:46,694
with a man she was forced
to leave behind,

1248
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:49,564
and only had three days
to conceive it.

1249
01:05:49,598 --> 01:05:52,167
This is the recipe she used

1250
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:55,003
to make her fertile.

1251
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:57,572
A recipe she still uses today.

1252
01:05:57,606 --> 01:06:00,241
Well, not for herself I'm assuming.

1253
01:06:00,276 --> 01:06:02,911
- She must be, what, in her 80s?
- Of course.

1254
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:08,349
But my friends' secrets
are at your disposal.

1255
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:13,421
What about your secrets, Margaux?

1256
01:06:13,455 --> 01:06:16,691
Why didn't you tell me about Nena?

1257
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:25,333
How do you talk about
the most painful heartbreak

1258
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:28,369
of your life?

1259
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:38,112
I loved Nena like the daughter
I never had.

1260
01:06:39,548 --> 01:06:42,183
I begged her to leave her husband.

1261
01:06:42,218 --> 01:06:45,019
He was a dark force...

1262
01:06:45,054 --> 01:06:47,889
who had a stranglehold on her soul.

1263
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:52,227
I tried so many ways

1264
01:06:52,261 --> 01:06:55,230
to help her out of the trap
I knew she was in.

1265
01:06:55,264 --> 01:06:59,567
I saw her the day before she died.

1266
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:06,741
I still remember her smile.

1267
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:12,347
She told me she was so happy.

1268
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,253
She was walking on air.

1269
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:24,259
I have no more secrets.

1270
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:28,062
No. I'm sorry.

1271
01:07:28,097 --> 01:07:33,134
I'm really sorry
I doubted you and Roman.

1272
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:35,603
It's just when I found out
about Nena,

1273
01:07:35,638 --> 01:07:38,673
I thought that you...

1274
01:07:38,707 --> 01:07:41,709
You were too good to be true.

1275
01:07:43,712 --> 01:07:49,450
Rosemary, our friendship is
not about replacing Nena.

1276
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:52,987
I care about you.

1277
01:07:53,022 --> 01:07:57,859
I just want you
to be happy and healthy.

1278
01:08:03,532 --> 01:08:07,302
I promise I will try some
of your stinky soup.

1279
01:08:07,336 --> 01:08:08,536
No.

1280
01:08:08,571 --> 01:08:12,807
You will finish every last drop.

1281
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:21,910
This is horrible.

1282
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:23,545
You want some?

1283
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,880
No?

1284
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:31,052
You're such a coward.

1285
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:33,188
Oh, my God.

1286
01:08:33,222 --> 01:08:35,223
I hope you had dinner

1287
01:08:35,257 --> 01:08:37,625
'cause all I have is
Margaux's fertility soup.

1288
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,361
Yeah, I know. I'm not hungry.

1289
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:43,031
- You okay?
- (Meow)

1290
01:08:43,065 --> 01:08:45,100
Yeah.

1291
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,936
I just don't know
if I just made a huge mistake.

1292
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:50,104
What do you mean?

1293
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,274
Guy?

1294
01:08:53,309 --> 01:08:55,110
I sold my book.

1295
01:08:55,144 --> 01:08:57,245
(Gasps)

1296
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,114
(Laughter)

1297
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:00,648
That's amazing!

1298
01:09:00,683 --> 01:09:04,819
Here, wait. I gotta show you this.
You ready? Look.

1299
01:09:04,854 --> 01:09:06,988
Look, look, look, look, look,
look, look, look, look, look.

1300
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,124
(Gasps)
Guy...

1301
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:11,259
I don't think I've ever seen
so many zeros

1302
01:09:11,293 --> 01:09:12,627
in one check before.

1303
01:09:12,661 --> 01:09:13,895
Right? And that's just the advance.

1304
01:09:13,929 --> 01:09:15,296
Mwah. Go on.

1305
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:16,331
Go get changed.

1306
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:17,932
Put on some fancy clothes

1307
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:20,602
because we are going out.

1308
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:21,803
What is that taste?

1309
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:22,837
That soup is bad.

1310
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:24,172
I know. Okay.

1311
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:25,774
- I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
- Go.

1312
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:27,609
The things I won't do for you
and this baby.

1313
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:29,444
- (Shrieks)
- (Laughs)

1314
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:38,520
(Somber music)

1315
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,359
What did you do about the shoes?

1316
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:46,995
I had to take them off.
Yeah, well...

1317
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,897
- At the opera?
- Yes.

1318
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:51,232
(Laughs)

1319
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,369
Look at my husband.

1320
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:57,038
Does he look happy to you?

1321
01:09:57,072 --> 01:10:01,176
You know, sometimes success
is hard to accept.

1322
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,711
Wait until he has a "problem" in bed.

1323
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:06,848
Then you'll really have to be
a cheerleader.

1324
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:10,251
(Chuckles)

1325
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:19,728
Merci.

1326
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:20,862
(Speaking French)

1327
01:10:20,896 --> 01:10:24,332
- Thank you.
- Merci.

1328
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,468
Roman, let's walk.

1329
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:28,303
I need to clear my head
from the wine.

1330
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:30,905
- (Roman, indistinct)
- Thanks.

1331
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,942
(Speaking French)

1332
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:48,356
I'm a little embarrassed to admit

1333
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:50,158
I was jealous of you.

1334
01:10:50,192 --> 01:10:51,226
Of me?

1335
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,027
You got to do in two weeks

1336
01:10:53,062 --> 01:10:54,929
what I couldn't do in two years.

1337
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,664
You got Guy to finish his book.

1338
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:58,600
He told me you were his muse.

1339
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:00,869
I wish I had that kind of power.

1340
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:03,371
You know, inspiration's a mystery.

1341
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:06,041
You know what inspired Napoleon
to propose to Josephine?

1342
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:10,311
That restaurant we were just
sitting in, the very booth.

1343
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:12,947
For Guy, who knows?
Maybe it was the new apartment,

1344
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:17,218
maybe it's the smell of your
sweet breath on his pillow.

1345
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,521
No, it was you.

1346
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:20,955
So thank you.

1347
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:23,992
But I'm still jealous.
(Laughs)

1348
01:11:27,129 --> 01:11:28,863
Are you cold? I can call the driver.

1349
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:30,598
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1350
01:11:30,633 --> 01:11:32,434
Yeah.

1351
01:11:32,468 --> 01:11:33,701
Margaux!

1352
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:34,936
Yes?

1353
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:36,905
Let's get in the car.

1354
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:38,873
No, don't be ridiculous.

1355
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:41,242
We're three blocks away.

1356
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:42,477
You okay?

1357
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:44,512
Yeah.

1358
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:49,817
(Speaking French)

1359
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:53,488
(Speaking French)

1360
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:55,090
I want what you promised.

1361
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:56,791
Look.

1362
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:58,059
Call me tomorrow,
and we'll sort everything out.

1363
01:11:58,094 --> 01:11:59,127
Everything will be fine.

1364
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:00,295
No more lies.

1365
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:01,329
(Gunshot)

1366
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,464
(Screams)

1367
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,665
Roman!

1368
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:05,733
- Hey!
- (Gunshot)

1369
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,369
- (Screams)
- (Groans)

1370
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:11,406
Call for help!

1371
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,640
Please...

1372
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:13,908
Somebody help us!

1373
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:16,111
Call for help!

1374
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:18,446
- Somebody help us!
- Your phone!

1375
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:21,449
- Give me your phone!
- Somebody help us!

1376
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:23,585
Somebody!

1377
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:29,557
(All speaking French)

1378
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,174
Roman is strong.

1379
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:48,208
And it's gonna take more
than a bullet to kill him.

1380
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:50,812
- Bonsoir.
- Monsieur.

1381
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:54,182
I hope you're here to give me
some good news.

1382
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:56,484
Please tell me the man
who shot my husband

1383
01:12:56,519 --> 01:12:58,052
suffered before he died.

1384
01:12:58,087 --> 01:13:00,221
Jacques Pascal is not dead,
Madame Castevet.

1385
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:02,791
They are prepping him
for surgery now.

1386
01:13:02,825 --> 01:13:06,194
I'll talk to him the moment
he regains consciousness.

1387
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:08,997
I would be curious to know
why he felt the need

1388
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:10,832
to shoot my husband.

1389
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:12,467
Jacques Pascal and his wife

1390
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:14,235
lived in the same apartment

1391
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,238
where Mr. and Mrs. Woodhouse
are living now.

1392
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:18,740
(Speaking French)

1393
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,008
Oui.

1394
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:22,377
His wife died three months ago.

1395
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:25,713
The police told me it was suicide.

1396
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:27,482
With what happened tonight,

1397
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:30,085
I think we may have to consider
another theory.

1398
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:33,188
Can I ask you a few questions?

1399
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:35,924
Can you tell me exactly
what Jacques Pascal said

1400
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,326
before he fired his weapon?

1401
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,894
Um, I don't know what he said

1402
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:41,930
because he was speaking in French.

1403
01:13:41,964 --> 01:13:43,598
And we were standing too far away.

1404
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:46,367
But then he said in English
"I want what is mine."

1405
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:48,670
No. "I want what was promised."

1406
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:51,339
And then he said, "No more lies."

1407
01:13:51,374 --> 01:13:53,274
And then he shot Roman.

1408
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:57,579
What promise could
your husband have broken?

1409
01:13:57,613 --> 01:13:59,514
C'est impossible.

1410
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:02,016
Roman would never break his promises.

1411
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:04,919
Anything else you can remember?

1412
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:07,756
Maybe you might have seen him
before tonight, or...

1413
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:10,425
I've never seen that man in person.

1414
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:14,028
No?

1415
01:14:14,063 --> 01:14:15,697
No. Never.

1416
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,699
All right, if you think of anything,

1417
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,734
let me know.

1418
01:14:19,769 --> 01:14:22,437
I wish your husband
a speedy recovery.

1419
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:24,305
Merci, monsieur.

1420
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,709
- Good night.
- Bonsoir.

1421
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:30,044
I want to start a prayer.

1422
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:31,546
Do you want us to come with you?

1423
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,815
No, I must do this myself.

1424
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,583
Are you sure you want to be alone?

1425
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:39,154
If you have faith,
you are never alone.

1426
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:46,061
(Ominous music)

1427
01:15:06,382 --> 01:15:09,384
(Whispering)

1428
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,331
(Monitor beeping)

1429
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:24,366
No, no, no.

1430
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:26,367
It cannot be. He's waking up.

1431
01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:28,436
(All speaking French)

1432
01:15:28,471 --> 01:15:32,407
(Jacques coughing, gasping)

1433
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:34,642
- Hold him, hold him!
- (Screams)

1434
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:36,311
(All shouting in French)

1435
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:39,280
- (Screams)
- (Speaking French)

1436
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:41,950
- I can't!
- (Shouting in French)

1437
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:43,852
(Rapid beeping)

1438
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:45,654
(Flatline tone)

1439
01:16:10,173 --> 01:16:11,974
Mm.

1440
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:18,313
I can only imagine how gruesome
I must look, my darling,

1441
01:16:18,348 --> 01:16:20,349
because you look terrible.

1442
01:16:21,584 --> 01:16:25,487
(Laughs)

1443
01:16:25,522 --> 01:16:27,256
I was worried, mon amour,

1444
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:30,059
but now I know
you're going to be fine.

1445
01:16:30,093 --> 01:16:32,361
Mm-hmm.

1446
01:16:32,395 --> 01:16:33,929
Ah.

1447
01:16:33,963 --> 01:16:34,963
How you feeling, Roman?

1448
01:16:34,964 --> 01:16:36,331
Well, I feel pretty...

1449
01:16:36,366 --> 01:16:37,900
pretty good.
(Laughs)

1450
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:39,201
(Groans)
Oh.

1451
01:16:39,235 --> 01:16:40,336
Careful.

1452
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,572
Oh, spoke... spoke too soon.

1453
01:16:43,606 --> 01:16:45,074
Thank you for coming.

1454
01:16:45,108 --> 01:16:48,944
They've been here with me all night.

1455
01:16:48,978 --> 01:16:52,915
Hmm. You are true friends.

1456
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:56,919
Well, it's the least we can do
for my benefactor.

1457
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:58,187
Hmm.

1458
01:16:58,221 --> 01:17:01,090
What happened to...

1459
01:17:01,124 --> 01:17:03,092
my attacker?

1460
01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:05,728
We don't know.

1461
01:17:05,762 --> 01:17:06,862
Do you need us to get you anything?

1462
01:17:06,896 --> 01:17:08,630
Yes.

1463
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:14,103
I need you to go home
and take my wife with you.

1464
01:17:14,137 --> 01:17:16,538
And this time, no walking.

1465
01:17:16,573 --> 01:17:19,274
You take the car.

1466
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:22,444
- (Laughs)
- We promise.

1467
01:17:29,385 --> 01:17:31,187
Bye.

1468
01:18:10,627 --> 01:18:13,595
You smell different.

1469
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,830
Sorry.

1470
01:18:14,864 --> 01:18:17,866
I guess with all the excitement...

1471
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,968
Something else.

1472
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:23,806
I know what it is.

1473
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,040
What?

1474
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,275
You're ready.

1475
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:29,712
You're ripe.

1476
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:30,979
Guy, wake up.

1477
01:18:31,014 --> 01:18:33,248
- We have work to do.
- Oh.

1478
01:18:33,283 --> 01:18:35,684
(Chatter, giggling)

1479
01:18:38,688 --> 01:18:42,891
(Cat meows)

1480
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:45,461
Margaux, are you sure
you want to do this?

1481
01:18:45,495 --> 01:18:46,695
I'm exhausted.

1482
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,464
And you must be too.

1483
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:49,898
Go take a shower.

1484
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:52,101
When you come out,
this will be ready.

1485
01:18:56,373 --> 01:18:59,374
(Indistinct muttering)

1486
01:20:12,749 --> 01:20:14,983
I feel so warm inside.

1487
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:16,218
Everywhere.

1488
01:20:16,252 --> 01:20:18,821
You look beautiful.

1489
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:20,723
Guy, I want this to be

1490
01:20:20,757 --> 01:20:26,462
the most romantic,
perfect night of our lives.

1491
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:30,265
No pressure, right?

1492
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:42,344
I feel so strange.
I'm floating away.

1493
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:34,063
(Wind whooshing)

1494
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:35,898
(Birds chirping)

1495
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:38,534
(Voice echoing)
Rosemary...

1496
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:16,432
(Tense music building)

1497
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,592
(Heavy breathing)

1498
01:23:52,269 --> 01:23:56,171
This isn't a dream.

1499
01:23:56,206 --> 01:23:58,641
This is real.

1500
