Episode 13

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,090
Seems like everything was stolen,
including money in safe-box and jewelry.
{Well, everything stolen, including money in safe-box and jewelry.}

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,040
And also...

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,920
... all the victims don't have an identity.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,980
We need to find the culprit at any cost.
{Whatever happens, we have to find the culprit.}

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,400
And restore the good name of CCG.
{And to restore the good name of CCG.}

7
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:09,900
Tch!

8
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,970
Annoying!

9
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,400
{}

10
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,240
So, this formula can be used{entered} here,
 and then here.

11
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,560
And the result...

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Fura, what time do you think it is 
right now?{Fura, what time do you think now?}

13
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,510
Sasada Aki, Is he not going to come
 today too?{Sasada Aki, today he did not get in again?}

14
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,450
I don't know.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,600
whatever.

16
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,190
Hey, Taishi.

17
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,850
You should continue 
playing Baseball.{Should you continue playing baseball.}

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,690
You love to play baseball, right?

19
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,790
Aki...

20
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,750
You don't have a book, do you?
{Did you forget your notes today?..Today, you do not carry a note, right?}

21
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,120
Arima, huh?

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,350
It's your book.

23
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,490
Don't worry, I remember everything.
{Don't worry, I remember all the lessons in my head.}

24
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,320
Take it.

25
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,140
Don't need it.

26
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,150
Why?

27
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,650
Fura, you rarely come to school.

28
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,180
You don't seem like a guy who can 
study well.{You also can not seem to understand the lesson.}

29
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,190
 I think you could use a book.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,690
What do you want, bastard ?!

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,040
Fura!

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,420
Get out! You're disturbing the 
other model students.

33
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,720
Who am I kidding, I'm not 
decent at studying.

34
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,050
Catch it! Catch it!

35
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,720
If I had continued playing baseball.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,340
Would I have been any different?{Will there be a little different?}

37
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,020
Bikers ahead, stop!

38
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,310
We will not stop, you idiot!

39
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,360
Aki, hold it right!

40
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,270
Aki ?!

41
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,380
Those guys, driving at that dangerous speed.
{Aki?That is dangerous driving....He was, as it was dangerous speeding.}

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,150
Wanna play tricks on them again?{Later plays tricks them again, yok!}

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,690
Ryou, Aki, what do you want?

44
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,090
Soda.

45
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,730
You guys are alike.

46
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,310
Okay then, the Loser pays.

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Oye, wait for me, shit!

48
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,800
-<i>Dash!</i>

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,180
Aki, how is Taishi doing lately?{Aki, what is often done by the Taishi lately?}

50
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,590
I don't know.

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,050
I don't know. But he is attending
the school regularly.

52
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,500
Woah, He didn't went to school even after leaving the
 baseball.{Wow! After stopping playing baseball he gets messed up, right?}

53
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,000
I think he has a girlfriend.{He gets the girl he liked did not, huh?}

54
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,550
Huh?

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,220
He pisses me off.

56
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,040
He quit baseball, left the team. 
He's  the worst.

57
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,020
He is{was} indeed so, yes...?

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,860
Even now!

59
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,680
If all three of us were together,...{And once, the three of us were always together.}

60
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,310
Won't it solve everything?{Do all the things that it will not come back?}

61
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,600
Of course that won't work.{Certainly will not be back, right?}

62
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,980
You're right.

63
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,650
Disgusting.

64
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:03,780
Here.

65
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,180
Oh.

66
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,210
What happened?

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,050
No, it's nothing.

68
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,040
Huh?

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,740
What th-{Why, heck {\ fscx250}

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,080
Don't!{Do!}

71
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,000
Geez, they are slow like old folks.{Geez, they are really old, anyway.}

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,840
Huh?

73
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,220
Oye!

74
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,390
You're way too late.{You're a long time, anyway!}

75
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,900
Who... are you?

76
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,150
Ghoul

77
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,030
Oye, you guys...?!

78
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,010
Run!

79
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,910
Come on run, hurry.{A quick run, come on!}

80
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,010
Are you being chased again-?{You chased by police lag }

81
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,960
No!

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,260
He is more dangerous!

83
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,270
Taishi!

84
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,870
Asshole!

85
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Who the hell is wearing 
a strange mask like that!

86
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,670
You don't know the blow 
of a baseball player, huh ?!

87
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,140
Pumpkin Head bitch!

88
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,060
I will kill you!{Will I consumed you!}

89
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,100
Stop it, Taishi!

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,590
Leave it and run!

91
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,170
Wa-Wat ?!

92
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,350
What... the...hell?

93
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,210
Aki!

94
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,410
Ryou...

95
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,610
We should... still... play baseball...someday.

96
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,980
I...

97
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,870
Ryou...!

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,900
... Sorry.

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,620
Ryou...

100
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Asshole!

101
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,380
Fura!

102
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,840
You could die.

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,610
Arima...?

104
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,070
Back off!

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,310
If you run, then I can't win.{Escaping feeling can not win, huh?}

106
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,480
Quick! Carry the body!

107
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,940
Can I talk to you for a minute?

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,880
CCG...?

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,320
So Arima, have you been dealing with horrible things like that...?

110
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,070
Bye, Fura. I'll see you later at school.

111
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,870
He seems like he has finished 
doing some club activities,...

112
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,830
Returning so casually...

113
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,140
Aki...

114
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,240
Ryou...

115
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,070
There's no way I can accept this...!

116
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,560
Yo!

117
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,120
Hey, what do you know about that monster?

118
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,430
Hurry Up! Tell me!

119
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,080
They are called <i>Ghouls</i>.

120
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,120
<i>Ghoul </i>?

121
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,340
They have the same form as humans.

122
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,230
They can blend with people.

123
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,930
They are inhumane.

124
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,860
Mutant man-eaters.

125
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,180
That is<i> ghoul </i>.

126
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,710
Arima, If you're going to hunt down that pumpkin head,
 I'll lend a hand.{Arima, if you're going to hunt down that Pumpkin Head, I'll help.}

127
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,850
It's alright, but, don't be a burden.{It's okay, just do not be a burden.}

128
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,010
Bastard!

129
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,500
I...

130
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,590
... Couldn't do anything in my power.
I had no choice {Can not do anything,
so I had no choice!}

131
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,090
But I'll have my revenge!

132
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,420
No matter what you say, I will do it!

133
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,540
I understand.

134
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,850
What if I bring a bat?

135
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,180
If they use weapons, 
it {all} would be pointless though.

136
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,000
<i>Ghouls</i>...are they that dangerous?

137
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,230
Of course.

138
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,770
Especially now already 10 days have passed...

139
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,000
True enough, right?

140
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,810
It's almost time for the next meal.

141
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,130
What an idiot, to pass through this dangerous path.

142
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,860
You look as if you are saying "<i>Eat Me</i>".

143
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,000
Arima!

144
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,680
She's fine, just unconscious.{He does nothing, just asleep.}

145
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,360
How do you know 
about her condition!?{Why you know her condition ?!}

146
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,420
Fura, be careful.

147
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,830
He is...

148
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,210
...terribly strong.

149
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,030
He is ready to attack.

150
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,480
Shit! Asshole

151
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,500
What the fuck are you doing!?{What are you doing, Fuck ?!}

152
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,750
Be kicked by me or be torned by him?
Which one do you choose?

153
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,490
Regular weapon won't be impervious to <i> ghouls </i>.

154
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,320
But then how...

155
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,240
... Can you win against a<i> ghoul </i>?

156
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,580
It's time to use <i> Yukimura </i>.

157
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,070
That...

158
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,260
What? why does this brat..

159
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,640
How could a boy like you...

160
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,810
... have weapons of a Ghoul Investigator.

161
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,990
It's easy...

162
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,380
Because I was a Ghoul Investigator.

163
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,220
Boy like you... an Investigator...

164
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,960
Impossible...

165
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,410
Arima...?

166
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,660
Yes, As I thought, he was strong.{Yes, I knew he was kind of strong.}

167
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,170
<i>Nice pitching.</i>

168
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,790
Arima.

169
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,210
I told you this is a secret investigation.

170
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,940
You are not allowed to act independently.

171
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,840
Marude-san....

172
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,180
But, it was to destroy the<i> ghoul </i>.

173
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,210
Don't just assume things on your own.{Do not assume good as jidatmu!}

174
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,950
If you die, it would be 
a problem for me!{If later you die, just know the taste!}

175
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,360
In addition, both of them are also
involved in the case now.{In addition, they both also involved with the case at that time.}

176
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,390
Both of them?{They both?}

177
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,660
Post-traumatic stress, you know about it, right?

178
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,300
Yes...

179
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,680
What do you want to talk about?

180
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,330
Fura, I will be {out}leaving school.

181
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,280
Huh?

182
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,030
You and Minami already know my identity.

183
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,370
This secret investigation has no meaning anymore.

184
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,110
What do you mean by that...?!

185
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,980
I was always moving residence to hunt <i> ghouls</i>.

186
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,520
It's been a while since I've spoken 
to someone of my age.

187
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,630
Normal school life is pleasant.

188
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,730
Thank you.

189
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,970
Just what kind of life is that ?!

190
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,390
But, nobody knows about you, right?

191
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,450
Because I would never disclose 
it to anyone, definitely!
{Because I certainly would not deploy identity it to anyone!}

192
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,930
Just stay for a little while.

193
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,070
Well, if you want me to stay a little while longer.

194
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,620
Really?

195
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,200
Yes.

196
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,200
In addition, there are things we must do.

197
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,620
<i>Lantern </i>.

198
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,620
I really wanted to destroy it.

199
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,490
You also want to avenge your friend, don't you?
{Do you also want to avenge your friend, is not it?}

200
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,990
So help me too, Taishi.

201
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,220
Of course!

202
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,900
You would become a nice bait.{You will be nice to become the bait.}

203
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,470
You didn't need to 
put it like that.{No need to explain that too, dong.}

204
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,680
I also...

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,530
I also want to help.

206
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,280
Aki.

207
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,340
Yo.

208
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,350
You're here again.{Again you here.}

209
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,010
Is it bad, huh?{Not to be, huh?}

210
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,710
If a yankee like you come here, 
I would be considered one of them too.

211
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,970
Stupid, what are you saying.{Stupid, where there is!}

212
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,400
What are you doing?

213
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm just looking at the scenery outside.

214
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,440
Oh really?

215
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,470
But, I can't see anything
from my right eye.{But yes, my right eye doesn't feel anything.}

216
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,860
I can't even tell which way I'm looking...

217
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,010
Perhaps this is my punishment...

218
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,980
...for doing stupid things at my will.

219
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,520
That's why...

220
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,010
...I've lost my right eye and Ryou too.

221
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,030
Everything was taken away from me.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,300
God might Just hate me.

223
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,810
Since then...

224
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,350
... I, Arima and Minami, 
the three of us started hunting.

225
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,820
And we managed to hunt down 
and eliminate 10 ghouls.

226
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,250
Minami as a planner.

227
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,530
As I became a bait,

228
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,650
Arima executed them.{And Arima be executioner.}

229
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,150
We... thought a little,
but we are a good team.

230
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,660
But...

231
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,600
... Until now we have not managed to
 hunt down the <i>Lantern </i>.

232
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,220
Here you are.{Here, yes!}

233
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,540
Perhaps this is just the result of Inquiry in school,

234
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,430
But I got a rumor that has to do with a ghoul.

235
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,690
So, here are all the details.

236
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,820
Woah, that's awesome!{Well, great!}

237
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,920
As expected of class president.{Class President, steady!}

238
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,190
It's about a suspicious person who always looks at the construction site,

239
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,230
Rumors are most likely to be correct.{Rumors
it is most likely correct.}

240
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,330
I have marked the location 
I suspect, let's look at it.

241
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,200
Yea! Thanks!

242
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,500
Great! let's investigate 
the factory!{Great! Let's get started then!}

243
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Thank you for the information.

244
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,960
Next, let me and Taishi do it.
You don't need to come.
{Next, let me and Taishi who do it, you do not need to participate.}

245
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,000
Oye Arima, don't say that.

246
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,510
Umm...

247
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,640
I'm still no good, huh?{Not to be, huh?}

248
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,560
If I'm allowed, I'll help 
with whatever I can.{If allowed I want to help you whatever it is.}

249
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,800
It's no good. If you come, 
the risk would be higher.{Not allowed. If you come,
the risk will be higher.}

250
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,500
Taishi, we'll go to the plant site after school.
{Taishi, home from school later we are going to the plant site.}

251
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,740
Be prepared.

252
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,360
Y-Yeah...

253
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,900
Your information is really awesome.
{Information  really very helpful, you know!}

254
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,380
Really?

255
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,590
Yes...

256
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,870
Thank goodness.

257
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,480
Uh, Fura-kun.

258
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,020
Arima-kun has changed, haven't he?

259
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,850
Yes, you're right. His name is also changed.

260
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,890
Arima Kishou....

261
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,210
Just like a <i>Knight</i>.

262
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,560
He's just like his name. He came to rescue me at the crucial time.
{Pas really with his name, because he came to the rescue at the crucial moment.}

263
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,740
Oh Minami, we have to go back to the class.

264
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,430
I want to be here for a while.

265
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,400
I see.

266
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,380
Yes.

267
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,540
Thanks for the notes.
 I'll return them soon.{Thanks to his notes, soon I return!}

268
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,050
I was useful...{I guess it's about time...}

269
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,470
What Minami said is true.{What is said Minami true.}

270
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,600
There was a ghoul 
in this factory.

271
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,970
Hey, Arima.

272
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,060
Don't you think you're a bit cold
to Minami?{Bu-Are not you a bit too cold to Minami?}

273
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,940
It's okay, isn't it?

274
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,630
Minami wouldn't mind it.

275
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,820
Pumpkin Head, It's rare to see
you hanging out here.

276
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,300
It seems that Ghoul Investigator 
is investigating this area,

277
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,150
Pumpkin Head.

278
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,690
I already know about the <i>Ghoul Investigator </i>.

279
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,960
Well, it's because you people
at random,right?

280
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,000
They consist of 3 high school students.

281
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,970
High School Students?

282
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,000
One of them is not an ordinary boy.{They are not ordinary boy.}

283
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,540
If you make haste, you'll be killed.{If you hasty surely be killed.}

284
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,040
He's nothing more than a child who was playing with his toy.
{They are nothing more than a child who was playing his toy.}

285
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,140
That boy would be a great toy 
to play with.{That boy is a great play toy.}

286
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,150
So you called me, just to 
talk about something like this?

287
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,070
One great enemy has emerged.

288
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,570
We share a common enemy. 
Let's make a truce.

289
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,020
That's fine by me.

290
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,360
Minami?

291
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,970
Fura?

292
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,760
Your information helped us a lot.
{We helped with your information, tablets.}

293
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,760
Thank God, I'm glad to be of use to you.

294
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,760
Hey, what's with you and Arima...

295
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
Huh!

296
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,770
What is it?

297
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,910
That guy...

298
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,370
See!

299
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,320
<i>Ghoul </i>, huh?

300
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
I don't know, but...

301
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,920
Gotta tell Arima!

302
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,420
Before that...

303
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,120
What's the matter?

304
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,070
... We are going after him!

305
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,790
You're right!

306
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,970
He entered this place?

307
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,860
Yes.

308
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,670
What's wrong, Arima?

309
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,460
Taishi, go  that way.
 Minami, remain with me.

310
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,740
And don't go away from me.{And do not stay away from me.}

311
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,310
Y-Yes.

312
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,360
Arima...

313
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,500
What?

314
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,490
Arima, you're great.

315
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,490
The way you attack the enemy...

316
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,480
... Your strength is truly amazing.

317
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,880
You are really great.

318
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,510
And also, it may seem strange in a place like this
that I'm telling you this.

319
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, it's about time.

320
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,620
Arima.

321
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,310
Die!

322
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,620
Arima...!

323
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,750
You knew that I'm a ghoul, don't you?

324
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,460
Well, I don't care, anyway.

325
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,090
But hey, Arima.

326
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,680
Today we bring one more friend.

327
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,060
Hurry up, otherwise she would die soon.
{Hurry please, otherwise she would die, the tablets.}

328
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,160
I have to fight with a kid like him?

329
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,030
It's no fun at all.

330
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,030
Oye, what's the matter?
Which part should I eat first?
{Oye Bro. Want the part where I eat first?}

331
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,030
Choose!

332
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,410
You can't focus while being concerned
about fura.{You're so out of focus due to the Fura
worry, right?}

333
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,580
Gotcha! Gotcha!

334
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,500
Don't try to think about your friend.

335
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,340
You wouldn't use it against me?

336
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Don't tell me!

337
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,150
Ba-bastard...!

338
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,340
Minami!

339
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,330
Arima! What does this mean?!
 What the hell happened?!

340
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,070
He was <i> Lantern </i>.

341
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,230
What?

342
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,900
What does he mean... this...?

343
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,190
I-It's a lie, right?

344
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,570
Minami...!

345
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,690
I've......always yearned to be a normal girl.

346
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,700
Play, learn, I wanted to be like a human.

347
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,710
Then why be like this...?!

348
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,680
I hate that kind of people.

349
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,350
They don't know how lucky they are
and still they fool around.

350
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,270
And yet they seem like they
are not satisfied. {Yet, they make face like they are not satified.}

351
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,860
For reasons like that...

352
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,360
I'm so fed up with people like that!

353
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,950
That's why I killed them!

354
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,360
They may not be aware of their mistakes, because they are stupid!

355
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,290
It is true that they were stupid...!

356
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,370
Causing problems, hurting each other...

357
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,380
They are trash that could not be recycled.

358
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,880
But...

359
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,340
But...

360
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,180
They were precious to me...!

361
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,890
Even though you pretend to be a normal human being, but you won't possibly be 
one! {Even though you yearn to be a normal human being, you won't possibly be one!}

362
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,020
You easily claimed the lives of human beings!

363
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,890
You're not human!

364
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,400
Arrogant one...!

365
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,020
Try being a ghoul, so that you can understand.

366
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,610
Lo-Look...

367
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,360
You're also...

368
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,370
... a killer.

369
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,370
Ah...

370
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,380
The exams are near.

371
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,880
and I had really prepared for it.

372
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,730
In the end, Minami's body was sent to CCG.

373
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,240
To prevent panic,
it was withheld by the school.

374
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,750
Arima also decided to change the school.

375
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,170
He says it's a case that has killed many investigators.

376
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,760
As always, Arima says,
 "Maybe then we are the ones who will die."

377
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,230
Hey, these ghouls...

378
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,070
...do they look like normal humans,
 like minami?

379
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,650
Either.

380
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,360
Because I have never talked with a <i> ghoul </i>.

381
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,080
Whatever happens they can never be like us...

382
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,090
I think I understand his feelings Minami.

383
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,020
Sorry.

384
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,600
Thank you very much.

385
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,880
Hey, Arima.

386
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,150
I will protect what I have to protect.

387
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,780
Perhaps this is stupid, so if impossible, then please tell me, huh?

388
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,890
I want to be...

389
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,490
{\fad(500,0)\shad1.5\blur3\bord1.5\fs105\pos(700,300)\fscx600\c&H1D1F2F&\3c&HC3C4DE&\4c&HC1C1DE&}-{\fscx100}12 YEARS LATER{\ fscx600}-

390
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,940
Fura-san, apparently our target has moved.

391
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,670
Okay, then tell Ida to keep an eye on it

392
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,790
Understood!

393
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,130
Senior !

394
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,340
Senpai, you are fighting with ghouls every day. Won't Mrs Aki be angry?

395
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,090
Shut Up! Don't talk about 
another man's wife at work.

396
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,350
I am sorry.

397
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,720
Arima, is concerned with the next case...

398
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,900
Mr.Arima has strong presence, doesn't he?

399
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,860
Fool, it's always like that.

400
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
Eh?

401
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,910
No.

402
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,180
Yes! Time for us to go home, 
and serve our beloved family!
