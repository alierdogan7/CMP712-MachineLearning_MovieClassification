00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,949
Hello.

5
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,961
Yes, I picked her up.

6
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,758
I know, I know.

7
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,560
Talk to her yourself.

8
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,763
Daddy wants to talk.
Quick, it's expensive.

9
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:12,963
Sanda?

10
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,665
Can't you see I'm busy?

11
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,469
Take this phone!

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,373
He can call back.

13
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,672
Take the phone, I swear!

14
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,373
What?
You'll punish me?

15
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,747
Call us at home.
In a half an hour.

16
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:33,153
What's with you!
Why are you like this?

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,757
You need help.

18
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,358
Excuse me?

19
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,378
Sanda, are you OK?

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,946
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

21
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,365
What are you doing?

22
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,971
I saw someone.

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:25,669
What?

24
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,973
Someone was on the road!

25
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,673
Probably a dog.

26
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,952
Can't we go now?

27
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,670
Super...

28
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,661
Try the engine, please.

29
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,149
Try it again.

30
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,754
Mom, what do I do?

31
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,668
Mom, what do I do?

32
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,977
Mom...

33
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,752
Mom?

34
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,955
Mom!

35
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,148

Mom!

37
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,950
Mom!

38
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,464
Mom!

39
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,469
Police station,
hold the line...

40
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,446
Police station,
hold the line...

41
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,048
"But he was joyful..."

"he was... free."

"Because he was... free."

47
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,576
Full stop.
Good?

48
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,640
See you next week.

49
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,648
- Bye.
- Bye.

50
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,954
- Bye.
- Bye.

51
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,653
Bye.

52
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,963
Clémentine.

53
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,074
Here.

54
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,943
- My curriculum from last year.
- Thanks.

55
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,953
I had a hard time finding it.

56
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,554
Thanks so much.
It'll be a great help.

57
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,757
Are they that bad?

58
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,453
Not at all.

59
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,956
I need some time to adjust.

60
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:05,166
- How long have you been here?
- Nearly 3 months.

61
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,762
You're managing well.

62
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,672
I'd love to speak your language
like you speak mine.

63
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,772
- My French is a catastrophe.
- Don't exaggerate.

64
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,546
Enjoy your weekend.

65
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,349
Thanks again.
Bye.

66
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,241
- Hello?
- It's me.

67
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,149
What do you feel like tonight?

68
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,949
You.

69
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,250
That's all?

70
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,655
I wouldn't say no to some wine.

71
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,955
Wine, me...
Anything else?

72
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,757
Whatever you rummage up.

73
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,264
- How long?
- Half an hour, traffic's good.

74
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,459
- See you soon.
- Bye.

75
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,750
Lucas?

76
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,971
- How are you?
- Fine.

77
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,948
What is it?

78
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,252
Nothing.

79
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,151
What's so funny?

80
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,959
- Hope it's productive, at least.
- So-so.

81
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,161
And you?

82
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,467
They were irritating today.
A dictation calmed them down.

83
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,770
I'm calling it quits!

84
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,366
Already?

85
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,678
Listen up,

86
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,045
you know a writer
never stops working.

87
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,244
Here, for example,
I turn off the computer.

88
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,946
I close the lid...

89
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,756
I stand up...

90
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,460
But in my head,
I'm still working.

91
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,258
Are you coming?

92
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,367
- And now?
- I'm working.

93
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,144
- And now?
- Still working...

94
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,952
- And now?
- You can keep trying.

95
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,047
- And now?
- Extreme concentration!

96
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,660
Shit!

97
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,262
You lose.

98
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,772
Can I come in?

99
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,253
Are you still there?

100
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,575
Well?

101
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,371
It's delicious.

102
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,672
Really?

103
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,244
It's unusual, but...

104
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,148
It's interesting.

105
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,246
Unusual? How?

106
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,355
Particular.

107
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,465
What exactly is in it?

108
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,367
Everything.

109
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,463
What do you mean?

110
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,667
I threw in all the groceries.

111
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,767
That explains it.

112
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,972
It's all-inclusive.

113
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,049
Starter, main dish, dessert...
From soup to nuts.

114
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,447
You don't like it?

115
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,145
- Yes, I do.
- If you don't like it...

116
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,951
- Fine, that's enough.
- Let's clear the table.

117
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,454
That's the way it goes.

118
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,052
- We're finished.
- It's not bad...

119
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,155
Get out.
You've hurt me enough.

120
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,066
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

121
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,275
Yes, you're sleeping.

122
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,677
I'm not sleeping.

123
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,552
- It looks bad.
- Really?

124
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,355
Really bad.
I think she's cheating on him.

125
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,952
That's unfortunate.

126
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,659
Want me to go?

127
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,965
No, it's my turn.

128
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,072
It's so annoying.

129
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,740
Are you going or am I?

130
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,249
It's alright. I'll go.

131
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,654
Doggy...

132
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,358
Doggy!

133
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,348
Here you are.

134
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,444
I thought you lost your appetite.

135
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,950
Stop barking.
It disturbs everyone.

136
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,654
Easy, easy.

137
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,457
That's it. Nothing left.

138
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,963
Go on.

139
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,366
Get lost!

140
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,442
The beast has been subdued.

141
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,345
Let's go to bed?

142
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,045
Come on.

143
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,556
Enough of this crap.

144
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,253
I'm exhausted.

145
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,056
Are you sleepy, Mr. Sleepy?

146
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,360
Aren't you sleepy?

147
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,368
- You're never sleepy.
- Never.

148
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,165
- How do you do it?
- I don't know.

149
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,970
- What's your secret?
- A little secret.

150
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,475
Tell me.

151
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,767
I'm going downstairs
to work a bit, OK?

152
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,958
This is such trash!

153
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,361
Who's on the line?

154
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,965
Who's on the line?

155
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,667
Who's on the line?

156
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,171
Who's on the line?

157
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,451
Lucas?

158
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,355
Lucas...

159
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,661
Wake up.

160
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,064
Wake up.

161
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,544
What's going on?

162
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,141
Didn't you hear it?

163
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,954
- What?
- The noise outside.

164
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,166
What are you doing?

165
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,565
Come on.
Let's go down and see.

166
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,249
Are you coming?

167
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,970
What are you doing?

168
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,473
- Nothing.
- Come on.

169
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,658
Why the hell's my car there?

170
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:29,970
Come see.

171
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,174
Do you see?

172
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,340
Don't be silly. I'll just check.

173
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,544
Stay there.

174
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,160
Anyone there?

175
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,265
Is anyone there?

176
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,138
Lucas!

177
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,340
Stay there!

178
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,067
Don't move!

179
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,369
Lucas, get inside!

180
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,348
Who?

181
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,458
Stop!

182
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,961
They came into my house.

183
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,259
No! I don't have them.

184
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,073
They're in the car!

185
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,267
- You really don't have the papers?
- No.

186
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,374
We don't have them.

187
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,949
Isn't there anything you can do?

188
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,244
We'll handle it tomorrow.

189
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,945
What about the former
owner's name?

190
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,352
Okay...

191
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,651
I'll call back tomorrow.

192
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,155
What a fool.
I left everything in the car.

193
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,640
What are you doing?

194
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,248
Come on.

195
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,455
I'll switch the meter on.

196
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,374
I can't see anything.

197
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:21,977
Wait!

198
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,546
Come on.

199
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,954
Wait for me!

200
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,343
Shit.

201
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,267
Hurry, come see.

202
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,265
What is it?

203
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,673
Look.

204
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,946
- What is it?
- Get down!

205
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,656
- Wait.
- Stay there!

206
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,761
- I'm coming with you.
- Stay there. Don't move.

207
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,145
Do you see something?

208
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,151
Do you see anything?

209
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,951
There's nothing.

210
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,758
Shit!
Work, dammit!

211
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,269
Stay there.

212
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,748
Come on!

213
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,269
Look!

214
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:07,974
Someone's there.

215
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,959
- Do you see anything?
- Nothing.

216
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,465
What is it?

217
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,770
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

218
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,971
We gotta call the police.

219
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,554
It'll be OK.

220
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,452
They're inside.

221
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,662
No.

222
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,959
They're in the house.

223
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,364
I'll go downstairs.

224
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,077
I'll go see.

225
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,269
Close the door.

226
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,950
Close it.

227
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,453
Close it!

228
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,653
Lucas!

229
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,958
What's wrong?

230
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,653
Answer me.
What's happening?

231
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,174
Lucas!

232
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,163
Clem, open up!

233
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,469
Open the door!

234
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,771
Clem! Open the door!

235
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,639
Open the door!

236
00:41:58,749 --> 00:41:59,738
I can't.

237
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,147
It's jammed!

238
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,660
Lucas, shit!

239
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,955
What happened?

240
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,762
What did they do to you?

241
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,165
Pull it out.

242
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,770
Don't move.

243
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,477
This can't be happening!

244
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,451
Go on.

245
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,749
Pull it out.

246
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,057
- I can't.
- Pull it out!

247
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,068
Pull it out!

248
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,571
Pull it out, dammit!

249
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,170
Come on!

250
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:15,950
Hold it tight!

251
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,359
Hang on tight.

252
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,167
Get up!

253
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,268
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

254
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,742
I'll look for a way out.

255
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,048
Hurry up.

256
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,463
I'll be quick.

257
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,753
Clem?

258
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,661
Clem?

259
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,139
Answer me!

260
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,057
Clem, answer me!

261
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,150
What's happening?

262
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,965
Answer me.

263
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,450
- Clem!
- Lucas!

264
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,254
Hurry up.
Get up!

265
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,555
Quick!

266
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,467
Hold it.

267
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:39,972
Come on!

268
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,352
Come on.

269
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,756
Come on.

270
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,665
Hurry up!

271
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,036
Move it!

272
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,350
Come on!

273
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,369
Don't look back, run.

274
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,451
Come on.

275
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,567
Come on.

276
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,450
Come on!

277
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,553
This way.

278
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,160
Get down.

279
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,977
Get down.

280
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:11,958
This way.

281
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:17,364
Go on, go on.

282
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,369
Lucas, try again!

283
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,968
Get up!
You can do it. Try again.

284
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,945
- I can't make it.
- Come with me!

285
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,345
Go on.

286
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,442
We won't make it otherwise.
Go on!

287
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,453
They're coming.
Go get help!

288
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,647
Go on, Clem.

289
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,747
Go get help!

290
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,450
I'll hide!

291
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,959
Go on.

292
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,360
Go on, Clem.

293
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,957
Hurry up!

294
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,147
Shit.

295
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,642
Clem!

296
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,452
Clem!

297
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,170
She can't breathe! Stop!

298
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,768
You're hurting her. Stop!

299
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:07,946
Let her go.

300
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,751
Let her go.

301
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,159
You're hurting her.

302
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,950
Come on. Get up!

303
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,957
Shit!

304
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,755
This way.

305
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,956
This way. Hurry up!

306
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,658
Follow him.

307
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,263
Come on!

308
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:06,270
Hurry!

309
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,561
Come on!

310
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,964
This way.

311
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,052
Quick! Come on, climb!

312
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:14,776
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

313
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,753
Clem...

314
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:09,956
Don't hit me.
I didn't do anything!

315
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,763
We just want to play!

316
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,461
Why won't you let us?
Let us!

317
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,968
Will you let us?

318
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:27,748
She's this way. Hurry!

319
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,745
This way!

320
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:04,460
<i>Five days after the events,</i>

321
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:07,866
<i>the bodies of Clementine Sauveur</i>
<i>and Lucas Medev</i>

322
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,768
<i>were found by the police.</i>

323
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,738
<i>After the investigation,</i>

324
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:19,336
<i>the murderers were arrested</i>
<i>in the Snagov region.</i>

325
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:23,350
<i>They were between the age of 10 and 15.</i>

326
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,756
<i>During the first interrogation,</i>
<i>the youngest amongst them declared:</i>

327
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:33,259
<i>"THEY wouldn't play with us..."</i>
