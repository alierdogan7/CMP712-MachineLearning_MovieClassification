175
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,538
Did you try Liza at her house?

176
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,708
Of course I tried the house, Maddy.
Of course I did.

177
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,543
Okay, go.
Travis, go get them now.

178
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,213
- (Madison mutters)

179
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,718
Mrs. Cruz:
There goes another one.

180
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,304
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

181
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,559
Mrs. Cruz: <i>Well,
should I get the cake?</i>

182
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,530
Call me if you're
gonna be longer.

183
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,483
If I'm longer, go without me.

184
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,571
- I'll catch up.
- No.

185
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,580

-<i> (children playing)</i>

187
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,237
- A little busy, Trav.

188
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,716
<i>I'm on my way over.</i>

189
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,607
What? No.

190
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:48,358
We agreed he was staying
with me this weekend.

191
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,077
Is Chris home from school?

192
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,946
- Did Nick go AWOL again?
-<i> Look, I'll explain there.</i>

193
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:55,415
Something's happened.
I'll explain when I get there, okay?

194
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,951
No, no, no.
You can't keep moving the goal-post.

195
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,620
<i>Liza, Jesus.</i>
<i>Just--</i>

196
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:02,706
Our settlement agreement
was very clear.

197
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,292
-<i> Is Chris home?</i>
- It's clear, Travis. It is defined.

198
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:08,095
-<i> You're not listening to me.</i>
- You get him three weekends a month.

199
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:10,380
You can't just pick and choose.

200
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,299
Can you just please call him?

201
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:14,601
- (horns honking)
-<i> Call him, tell him to get his ass home.</i>

202
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,803
Liza:
<i>He'll be home any minute.</i>

203
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,971
(honks horn)

204
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,439
Travis:
<i>Now, Liza!</i>

205
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,942
I'll see you next weekend.

206
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,480
<i>(helicopter blades whirring)</i>

207
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,318
Man: <i>T.J., let's go, go.
Check it out.</i>

208
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,986
Woman:
<i>Yeah, another homeless.</i>

209
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:35,289

211
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:54,641
Madison: <i>Alicia. Alicia.
We need the bucket.</i>

212
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:03,984
<i>Alicia?</i>
<i>Alicia, get the bucket.</i>

213
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,889
Dr. Han.
Hi, it's Maddy Clark again.

214
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,525
Listen, uh, Nick is
really hurting right now,

215
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:14,361
and I just need you to call in the
prescription so I can pick it up,

216
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:17,531
but I'm really worried about him, and
I think he really, really needs it.

217
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:20,701
- Hang in there, big brother.
- (breathing heavily)

218
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:22,703
We're gonna get
your medicine, okay?

219
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:24,788
Alicia: Longer we leave
him, the worse he gets.

220
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,374
- I know. I'm aware.
- He won't be able to travel.

221
00:14:27,376 --> 00:14:30,377
- Alicia.
- I gotta get under the blanket.

222
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:34,464
Mom, what are you gonna do?

223
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:36,350
I don't know.
Dr. Han's not calling me back,

224
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:38,051
and now I can't
even reach Travis.

225
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:39,636
Yeah, I mean, it's like
after an earthquake.

226
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,305
Circuits are overloaded.

227
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:45,025
- Got anything stashed?
- No.

228
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:46,226
Vicodin for my wisdom teeth.

229
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:48,228
I flushed 'em.

230
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,147
It's dangerous for him
to go cold turkey like this.

231
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,366
- I know. I know.
- Mom, I--

232
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,901
- It's okay.
- The doctor's. You can pick 'em up.

233
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:56,737
Mom.

234
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,205
I don't even know--
I think they're closed.

235
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:00,207
They're not calling me back.
By the time I--

<i>(distant sirens wailing)</i>

237
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,879
Watch him.

238
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:07,998
- Prom-- do not leave the house.
- I wo-- I won't.

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,717
- Alicia, promise me.
- I'll look after him.

-<i> What's going on out there?</i>

246
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,108
Was there an accident?

247
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,777
It'll clear up
past Sherman Oaks.

248
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,862
I don't even know
why I asked you.

- Tobias.

No, no, no, homie.
Keep that camera up.

Jail? For what?
Freedom of speech?

Right to lawful assembly?

280

threatening nobody.

376

No satellites, no Internet,

Communications will fail 'cause no
