00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,177
JESSE: Let's just go
check out that last room.

513
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,814
(SNIFFING)

514
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,547
Dude, it fucking stinks.

515
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,686
HECTOR: Oh, fuck!

516
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,056
JESSE: Oh, shit, dude.

517
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,390
What is that?
Is that blood?

518
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,758
Yes, <i>"vive."</i>

519
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,026
Check this shit...
Don't get close to that shit.

520
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,626
Holy fuck!

521
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,096
There's blood everywhere.

522
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,797
JESSE: Hold on.

523
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,699
HECTOR: What is it?

524
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,939
JESSE: Some type of
journal or something.

525
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,641
HECTOR: Come on, dude,
let's just fucking go already.

526
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,463
JESSE: All right,
let's go.

527
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,470
JESSE: Holy shit!
HECTOR: Oh, fuck! (GASPING)

528
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,648
What you guys doing here?

529
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,666
You heard that he did this shit.
That wasn't my little brother.

530
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:36,621
What about that bitch that used to
stay right here? You know about her?

531
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,756
HECTOR: Honestly,
we don't know shit, man.

532
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,057
JESSE: We don't
know anything.

533
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,091
Get the fuck out of here.

534
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,194
JESSE: Oh, fuck.
HECTOR: Come on.

535
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,999
MARISOL: I can't believe you
guys stole this from her house.

536
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,340
Look, she has
a whole bunch of pictures.

537
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,202
MARISOL: What's that?

538
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,105
This looks dope.

539
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,638
HECTOR: What language is that?

540
00:22:56,664 --> 00:23:00,602
They're basically saying
that if you build this door,

541
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,682
it's like, you could
travel through time.

542
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,206
HECTOR: Man, if she could
travel through time,

543
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,085
why the hell is she staying
in this shitty-ass apartment?

544
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,154
I'd timeportal my ass to
the Bahamas or something.

545
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,089
No, it says <i>destinos profanos.</i>

546
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,792
Like, you could only go to
unholy places through this door.

547
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,527
HECTOR: Unholy places.
Oh, shit.

548
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,135
What's an unholy place?
How am I supposed to know?

549
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:21,400
I'm trying to get up into Marisol's
friend Espi's unholy place.

550
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,435
Oh, you're so nasty, man.
Dude, that's her cousin.

551
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,569
Look at this.
Can I see it?

552
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,442
MARISOL: Looks like some
medieval looking type of shit.

553
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,843
What is that?

554
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,647
It's a map.
Scavenger hunt.

555
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:39,382
HECTOR: This is like what Ana was
painting on that naked chick.

556
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,685
JESSE: That is.

557
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,621
MARISOL: Oh, shit.

558
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,022
Maybe this is the ritual
she was doing to her.

559
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,257
<i>"Levantese, incubo.</i>

560
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>"Lo convoco."</i>

561
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,432
(SCOFFS)
HECTOR: What's the<i>incubo?</i>

562
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,132
It's like a demon.

563
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,600
A demon?
(GROWLS)

564
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,683
HECTOR: Why couldn't we
just buy a black mirror?

565
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,675
Where the hell can you
buy a black mirror at?

566
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,444
That doesn't even make any sense.

567
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,145
JESSE: That's my boy.
Man, shut up.

568
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,580
It's supposed to be
like a doorway.

569
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,714
Like a portal.

570
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,849
Like a port?

571
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,751
Yeah, to the spirit world.

572
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,854
I better not fall off this shit.
The spirit world, what...

573
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,822
Yeah.
How do you even know this shit?

574
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,491
I looked it up, fool.

575
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,092
Grandma said we shouldn't
be fucking with that shit.

576
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,461
Don't even worry about that.
Oh, my gosh!

577
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,862
Just let it go.

578
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,764
We're just gonna fuck around
and then, you know...

579
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,425
Nothing's gonna happen.

580
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:35,841
Don't trip.
You tie your shoes?

581
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,777
Why can't we just do this
at your apartment?

582
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,480
If my<i>abuelita</i> saw this shit...

583
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,815
She would flip out. You know
how superstitious she is.

584
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,756
Here, go in fast, but be quiet.

585
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,988
MARISOL: Are you sure nobody's
gonna catch us in here?

586
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,530
Yeah, I'm sure. Go through
this door right here.

587
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,126
Fuck!

588
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,928
See the chandelier?

589
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,329
That is dope. It looks
crazy in the dark.

590
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,534
MARISOL: It's so quiet.
Let's do it right here.

591
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,435
Okay, I'm gonna put this down.

592
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,937
Did you hear that?

593
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,604
No.

594
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,273
I swear to God.

595
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,877
You're tripping.

596
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,413
So what are we supposed to do?

597
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,648
Make a triangle. I'm gonna
make it right here.

598
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,716
And then put a circle in the
middle and put the mirror...

599
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,225
Damn, that looks good.

600
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,406
Yeah?
It looks just like the drawing.

601
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,728
Over here.

602
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,799
After we say the spell,

603
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,536
then the portal's
supposed to open up.

(LAUGHING)
I don't know.

605
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:39,903
Is something supposed
to come through?

00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,806
I don't know.

607
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,309
Is it gonna be floating around and shit?
Yo, that's gonna be dope.

Why?

no point of, like, going on.

I noticed Oscar started acting
different about a month ago.

1194
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,720
He got real quiet.

1195
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,323
Stayed in his room all night.

1196
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,628
Then he started even
acting crazy with my mom,

1197
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,690
started breaking
shit in the house.

1198
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,431
Then I found this.
MARISOL: Oh, shit.

1199
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,202
HECTOR: Oh, fuck.
Can we take a look at this?

1200
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:40,336
ARTURO: The last time
I seen my brother,

1201
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,804
he said there was
others like him.

1202
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,340
He said they were all marked.

1203
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:47,010
He said these witches were trying
to build an army or some shit.

1204
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:48,277
MARISOL: An army for what?

1205
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,212
These are all in
different languages.

1206
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,347
ARTURO:
From all over the world.

1207
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,049
HECTOR: It's all little kids?

1208
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,351
ARTURO: All little boys.
First-born boys.

1209
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,120
JESSE: Like you.

1210
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:59,288
ARTURO: I'm the first-born.
JESSE: That's why...

1211
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,723
But Oscar was adopted.

1212
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,228
So what happened with his mom?

1213
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:08,164
She died at birth.
My mom and dad took him.

1214
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,932
HECTOR: That's like
your mom, Jesse.

1215
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,100
Your mom?

1216
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:13,136
Yeah... (STUTTERS)

1217
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,303
His mom died
while she was giving...

1218
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,937
Who's this girl?

1219
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:18,841
All these are boys,
and then there's this...

1220
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,243
Isn't Carlsbad near here?

1221
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:22,010
HECTOR:
Yes, it's pretty close.

1222
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,047
"Ali Rey was..."

1223
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,848
Wait, that's her!
HECTOR: What is?

1224
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,216
That's her. It's Ali Rey.

1225
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:29,550
It says "Ali Rey" in the article.

1226
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,154
Was he talking to her?

1227
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,922
Do you know her?
ARTURO: I have no idea.

1228
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,958
Thanks. We appreciate it, man.
We got to go.

1229
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,393
HECTOR: What are you doing?
We should check this stuff out, man.

1230
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:40,061
Come on. Let's just go.
Thanks.

1231
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,198
MARISOL: Jesse, what's wrong?
HECTOR: Jesse...

1232
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,480
ARTURO:
What's up with your boy, man?

1233
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:46,459
No, he's just going
through a lot right now.

1234
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,641
JESSE: Yo! Let's roll.
HECTOR: Yeah. Sure.

1235
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,181
HECTOR: So what's up, dude?
What's wrong with you?

1236
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,017
Nothing, man.

1237
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:03,919
What do you mean, nothing?
Why'd you take off like that?

1238
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,123
I said, nothing, man.
I'm fine.

1239
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:09,104
Was it the thing about the mom?

1240
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,930
Dude, Jesse, all that shit's exactly
what's been happening to you.

1241
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:14,897
All that stuff that
Oscar was saying.

1242
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,199
No, it's not.

1243
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,867
Then how do you explain
all the crazy shit

1244
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:19,067
that's been happening?
Just back up, Hector.

1245
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,903
Please.

1246
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,972
No shit, man. You're the one
who told us to go to Arturo's.

1247
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:25,073
You don't want to
talk about it now?

1248
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,443
What's wrong?

1249
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,946
Jesse.

1250
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,248
Dude, Jesse.

1251
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:33,989
Is this guy bothering you?

1252
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,618
What? No. This is Pablo.

1253
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,221
Oh, is this your boyfriend?
He's a friend from high school.

1254
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,989
No.

1255
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:44,592
Jesse, what's up?

1256
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,197
Jesse, what's wrong with you?
Yeah, what's...

1257
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:50,565
What's your problem, man?
HECTOR: Jesse.

1258
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,771
Jesse, calm down.

1259
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,033
Just chill out.
HECTOR: Dude, calm down.

1260
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,508
Did you not fucking hear me?
I said get out of here!

1261
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:00,076
Dude, Jesse.
What the fuck, dude?

1262
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,178
He's not doing anything to me.
Just calm down.

1263
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:05,014

me like that for, huh?
HECTOR: Jesse, dude... Hey!

1264
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:05,882
Jesse, don't...
Dude, calm the fuck down.

1265
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:06,951
Are you serious right now?

1266
01:03:06,977 --> 01:03:09,252
Yeah, I'm serious. Do I look
like I'm fuckin' playing?

1267
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:12,321
Jesse, dude, let's fucking go.
What are you doing, man?

1268
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:16,225
Hey, Jesse, what the fuck, dude?
Just leave him alone!

1269
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:18,294

SHOPKEEPER: You, get out of here!

1270

1273
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,501

here if you're gonna fucking hit me?

I'm losing time. I can't...

special or something.

it's not gonna work again.

it's gonna work twice?
