is about to commence.

678
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,044
Oh, look, miss.

679
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,556
I borrowed your pin cushion.

680
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,785
I hope you don't mind.

681
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,396
Miss Giddens, dear,
would you sit there?

682
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,797
And, Mrs. Grose,
would you sit there too?

683
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,341
And now Miles will recite to you.

684
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,076
A poem.

685
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,311
What shall I sing to my lord
from my window?

686
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,854
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not stay?

687
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,891
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not listen?

688
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,758
Where shall I go,
for my lord is away?

689
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,698
Whom shall I love
when the moon is arisen?

690
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,235
Gone is my lord...

691
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,067
and the grave is his prison.

692
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,234
What shall I say
when my lord comes a-calling?

693
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,440
What shall I say
when he knocks on my door?

694
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:36,178
What shall I say
when his feet enter softly...

695
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:40,347
leaving the marks
ofhis grave on my floor?

696
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,448
Enter, my lord.

697
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,187
Come from your prison.

698
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,196
Come from your grave...

699
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,199
for the moon is arisen.

700
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,701
[ Whispers ]
Welcome, my lord.

701
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,046
[ Whispers ]
Look at that.

702
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,548
- What, miss?
- I was afraid for them.

703
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,552
But what if he knows?
What if Miles knows?

704
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,555
Knows what,
Miss Giddens, dear?

705
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,557
You think I'm imagining it...

706
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,560
and yet just now you yourself saw
and heard Miles-

707
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,062
Playing a game.

708
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,065
You told me
Quint and Miles were always together.

709
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,067
But Master Miles
wasn't to blame for that.

710
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,070
- Yes, but couldn't you have stopped it?
- I wasn't in charge, miss.

711
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,005
It wasn't for me to question
the master's arrangements.

712
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,009
The master
put Quint in charge here.

713
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,569
Besides, no one
could go against Quint.

714
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,583
You were afraid of him?

715
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,087
But what of Miss Jessel?

716
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,089
Couldn't she
have done something?

717
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,591
Or was she afraid of him too?

718
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,594
Not at first.
At least-

719
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:57,190
In the beginning, when she first came here,
she was always happy and smiling.

720
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,201
Very fond of music she was...

721
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,134
and dancing.

722
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:05,072
She and Miss Flora used to dance together,
dance by the hour.

723
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,075
But she changed.

724
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,077
Oh, yes, she changed.

725
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,079
'Twas hard to believe...

726
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:14,082
her being an educated young lady
and Quint being...

727
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,584
- [ Miles Laughing ]
- well, what he was.

728
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,587
[ Flora Screaming ]
Stop it, Miles.! Stop it.!

729
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,589
You see? I knew
they'd be overexcited.

730
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,591
It's long past their bedtime.

731
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,594
Yes, but what did you mean
about Quint and Miss Jessel?

732
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,130
Look, miss, they're dead, gone.

733
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,723
There's no point in telling tales
of what's over and done with.

734
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,775
Over and done with?

735
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,780
Yes, but is it?

736
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,575
[ Flora, Miles Laughing ]

737
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
[ Miles ]
Let go, Flora. You'll fall in.

738
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,240
[ Flora ]
But I want to row the boat.

739
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,374
Silly.
You know you can't.

740
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,045
Miss Giddens, tell Miles
to let me row.

741
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,554
I will,
when you're a little older.

742
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,886
But it's too heavy
for you now.

743
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,291
I don't care.
I've got a boat of my own anyway.

744
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,064
[ Goose Honking ]

745
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,066
[ Sighs ]

746
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,966
Heavenly, warm sun.

747
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,971
It's almost hot.

748
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,974
I like it when it's hot.

749
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:49,477
- Do you know what Miles told me once?
- No, dear. What?

750
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,037
He said that once, when he was on the lake,
he could see a hand waving on the bottom.

751
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,813
But Mrs. Grose said,
"Stuff and nonsense.! Stuff and nonsense.!''

752
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,093
Miss Giddens,
can tortoises swim?

753
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,095
No, dear.

754
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,165
I thought
perhaps they couldn't.

755
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,765
## [ Humming "O Willow Waly'' ]

756
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,176
## [ Continues ]

757
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,247
Flora, where did you
learn that song?

758
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,709
I don't think I remember.

759
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,286
## [ Resumes Humming ]

760
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:35,082
It's the song
from the music box, isn't it?

761
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,785
Isn't it?

762
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:41,091
## [ Continues ]

763
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,784
[ Miss Giddens ]
Flora.!

764
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,788
Who is it?

765
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,358
Over there.

766
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:46,457
Oh, goodness, miss, you gave me
quite a turn sitting there in the dark.

767
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,624
- And where are the children?
- Upstairs with Anna.

768
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:54,932
I wanted to be by myself
for a while, to think.

769
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:58,838
Well, miss, I'm sure a little light
will make your thoughts more cheerful.

770
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:03,709
Mrs. Grose?
There are two of them.

771
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,804
I beg your pardon?

772
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:10,216
Two of those abominations.

773
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,549
Today, down by the lake...

774
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,457
there in the broad sunlight...

775
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,621
I saw the other one.

776
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,530
- The other one?
- A woman dressed in black.

777
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,003
- Miss Jessel.
- Oh, but Miss Jessel's dead.

778
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,835
She died, why, almost a year ago.

779
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,241
Huh. Almost a year ago.

780
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,109
Almost a year.

781
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,206
Flora saw her too.

782
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,308
- Did she tell you so?
- No, of course not.

783
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,887
She lied to me.
Well, it amounted to a lie.

784
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:49,049
Oh, now, miss, I've never known
either of the children to tell lies.

785
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,218
- Why would they?
- Why?

786
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,161
Because they are both playing...

787
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:58,064
or being made to play
some monstrous game.

788
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,693
I can't pretend to understand
what its purpose is.

789
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,136
I only know that it is happening.

790
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,268
Something secretive
and whispery...

791
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,369
and indecent.

792
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,849
I tell you, believe me,
the children are in dreadful peril.

793
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,511
Well, what are we to do?

794
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,521
Then you do believe me?

795
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,353
You don't think I'm imagining it?

796
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:27,260
- I believe you, miss.
- Oh, thank God. Thank God.

797
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,162
I've been so frightened.
I've felt so alone.

798
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,895
But together,
with you to help me-

799
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,471
Oh, yes, miss, I'll help you.
Only tell me how.

800
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,836
Yes.

801
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,901
We must try to learn
what it is these horrors want.

802
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:49,618
Think, Mrs. Grose.
The answer must lie in the past.

803
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:56,625
Were Quint
and Miss Jessel in love?

804
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,925
They were in love, weren't they?

805
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,127
Love? Oh, I suppose
that's what she called it.

806
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,363
But it was more
like a sickness...

807
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:13,841
a fever that leaves the body
burned out and dry.

808
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,537
There was no cruelty
she wouldn't suffer.

809
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,173
If he struck her- Oh, yes,
and I've seen him knock her to the floor-

810
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:24,720
she'd look at him as though
she wanted the weight of his hand.

811
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,654
No pride, no shame.

812
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,157
Crawl to him on her hands and knees,
she would.

813
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,720
And him laughing at her.
Such a savage laugh he had.

814
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,927
Oh, it hurts me to remember.

815
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,994
Bad she was, but no woman
could have suffered more.

816
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:47,736
Aperson ought to
keep quiet about it.

817
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,176
You must tell me.

818
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,774
Oh, miss, there's things
I've seen I- I'm ashamed to say.

819
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,943
Go on.

820
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,320
Rooms...

821
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,052
used by daylight...

822
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,594
as though
they were dark woods.

823
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,464
They didn't care
that you saw them?

824
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,931
And the children?

825
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,171
I can't say, miss.
I-I don't know what the children saw.

826
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,838
But they used to follow
Quint and Miss Jessel...

827
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,576
trailing along behind
hand in hand, whispering.

828
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,244
There was too much whispering
in this house, miss.

829
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,787
Oh,yes, I can imagine.

830
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,517
Yes, I can imagine
what sort of things...

831
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,560
they whispered about.

832
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:43,223
Quint, Miles.
I can hear them together.

833
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,564
But there was nothing wrong
in Master Miles wanting to be with Quint.

834
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,194
Quint taught him to ride
and took him walking.

835
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:52,502
- The poor lad needed someone to-
- To corrupt him?

836
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,941
But Master Miles
is a good boy, miss.

837
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,512
- There's nothing wicked in him.
- Unless he's deceiving us.

838
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,139
Unless they're both deceiving us.

839
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,185
- The innocents.
- Innocents they are, miss.

840
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,686
It's not fair.
You have no right to accuse them of-

841
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,257
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Grose.
I'm not accusing.

842
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:13,455
I'm just trying to put it together,
to understand.

843
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:16,464
Tell me, were the children happy?

844
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,693
Oh, they seemed to be.
The same as now.

845
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,636
But sometimes I used to wonder if
they really cared for them, those two...

846
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,902
or if they weren't

And if you're planning another cruelty-

as many children as I have...

01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:07,658

be worse than any bad dream.

- No.
- It's the shock.

to tell their uncle?

- What letter, miss?
- To their uncle. I left it on the desk.
