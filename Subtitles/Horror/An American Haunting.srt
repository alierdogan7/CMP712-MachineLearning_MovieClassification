1
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,860
(panting)

2
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,312
(rattling)

3
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,662
(clock ticking)

4
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,732
(screaming)

5
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,039
- Jane! Jane! It's Momma.

6
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,977
(screaming)
Look at me!

7
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,139
J-Jane. Jane.

8
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,012
- No! No!

9
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,349
(panting)

10
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,021
- Oh, thank God.

11
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,751
D'you have another nightmare,
honey?

12
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,861
Let's get you
into a nice hot bath, huh?

13
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,523
- Can I do it later? Please?

14
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,231
- All right.
But you have to get ready

15
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,896
for your father.
It's his weekend with you.

16
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,031
- I know. I know.

17
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,876
- What's this?

18
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,040
- I found it in the attic.

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,912
- Honey, you know
the attic's off-limits.

20
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,385
- Sorry.

21
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,252
- Just don't do it again, okay?

22
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,774
I know how you feel.

23
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,798
- November 1848.

24
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,261
I hoped that no one
would ever find cause

25
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,771
to open this letter.
If you have,

26
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,808
I must assume
that unexplained...

27
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,376
or even supernatural events

28
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,039
have begun to occur.

29
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,283
The story of the Bell witch

30
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,115
had always been considered
to be a tall tale.

31
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,449
(laughter)

32
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,988
This is not so.

33
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,287
Please, read this journal
with great care...

34
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,994
... for its contents
may save your life.

35
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,324
- Now where are you gonna go?

36
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,035
Just one kiss.
- No, Joshua.

37
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,476
- Leave that young lady alone.

38
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,910
(laughter)

39
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,640
Did he try to kiss you again?

40
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,218
- lsn't there something
you should be doing, Miss Bell?

41
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,855
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mother.
I was thinking about something else...

42
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,592
- Probably about torturing poor Joshua.

43
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,659
You really should be nicer to him,
Betsy.

44
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,534
- A woman must keep a man
on his toes at all times.

45
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,233
Isn't that what you taught me?

46
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,503
- I taught you no such thing,
Betsy Bell.

47
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,873
- I'm gonna make Joshua

48
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,172
Iove me forever.

49
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,180
- Well, then you better
stop mistreating him.

50
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,680
- You think I was too hard on him?

51
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,220
- Just a little bit.

52
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,224
- What would I do without you?
- Oh, you'd just shrivel up

53
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,024
and blow away.
Now, don't forget your schoolwork.

54
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,394
- I won't!

55
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,039
(children laughing)
- Good evening, sir.

56
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,042
- My hat, thank you.

57
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,372
Ah.

58
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,912
(Jig music playing)

59
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,982
-... then James Johnson grabbed it,
swallowed a swig of it,

60
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:56,953
wiped his mouth,

61
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,220
then he took hold of the wheel
at the axle

62
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,821
and in an instant, that carriage
was up and and out of that snowbank

63
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,491
as if 1 0 men had had a hold of it.
Ten! Ten!

64
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,431
- Speak of the devil!

65
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,800
I thought you'd gotten lost!
- I'm not stewed

66
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,862
that I can't find
the fob next door.

67
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,431
- I was telling them about you
and that carriage last winter.

68
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,909
- Ha-ha! I did...
- Not yet!

69
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,444
-... that carriage!

70
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,072
- With the help
of a good swig of horse liniment.

71
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,137
- Who has the drink?

72
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,275
- You're three sheets to the wind
already.

73
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,453
(children giggling)

74
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,287
- I'm so sorry, Professor Powell.
- It's all right.

75
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,951
They're just having fun.

76
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,257
(laughter)
- Theny!

77
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,094
- Is there not a... tradition
connected to mistletoe,

78
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,259
Professor Powell?
- Well...

79
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,997
(John laughing)
- Yes, but...

80
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,837
- Elizabeth Bell,
it's not appropriate

81
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,002
for a student to place a teacher
in such a compromising situation.

82
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,512
You know better than that, precious.
- Well...

83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,945
it is Christmas, Father.

84
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,178
And I am simply attempting
to learn the traditions.

85
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,686
Who better to learn from
than one's teacher?

86
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,613
- My prize pupil always seems

87
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,056
to have a ready answer
for everything, John.

88
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,653
Would you settle
for a dance, Betsy?

89
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,667
- Oh, John,
let them have their dance.

90
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,828
- May I steal this Bell
for a dance?

91
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,839
(Mrs. Bell laughing)
I promise not to step on your toes.

92
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,192
(sobbing)

93
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,857
- John!

94
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,702
(rapid thumping)

95
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,718
(moaning sound)

96
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,575
(quick sobbing sound)

97
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,265
(child crying)

98
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,770
(rapid thumping)

99
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,947
(gasping)

100
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,076
John...

101
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,985
I heard noises on the roof.
- It's coming from the attic.

102
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,454
(pattering)

103
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,416
- Squirrels?

104
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,289
- No, it's too loud for squirrels.
(running footsteps)

105
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,191
It's the third time I've heard it

106
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,162
in as many nights.
- I hadn't heard it.

107
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,825
- You sleep so sound,

108
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,368
you don't even feel me
get out of bed.

109
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,664
- Yes, I do.

110
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,466
(wind blowing softly)

111
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,006
Listen.

112
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,134
It stopped.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,343
- What was it?

114
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,145
- Probably that witch trying
to wear me out before tomorrow's trial.

115
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,344
- Oh, bite your tongue, John Bell!

116
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,151
(creaking)

117
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,496
(soft breathing)

118
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,805
- Man 's a lyin ' pig!
- Miss Batts!

119
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,142
- Stole my land!
(pounding)

120
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,182
- Miss Batts,

121
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,739
we have heard

122
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,911
your side of the story.

123
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,387
Please allow John Bell
to finish his.

124
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,914
- So, we offered her the use
of our slave, Samuel,

125
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,722
and the loan of $100

126
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,763
in exchange for our use
of that small piece of her land

127
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,628
that abuts our own.
- At 20% interest!

128
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,257
(gavel pounding)
- We shook on it!

129
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,767
- Oh!
- Spit and shook,

130
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,100
I gave you two harvests to pay

131
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,731
and you didn't pay for it,
so you forfeited the land.

132
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,935
(gavel pounding)
It was a fair price for it.

133
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,911
- Twenty-percent interest?

134
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,345
- Well...

135
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,352
it seemed like a reasonable charge
under the circumstances,

136
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,751
given her reputation.

137
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,694
- John Bell,

138
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,697
you broke church law.

139
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,926
Twenty-percent interest...

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,195
... under church canon...

141
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,463
... is usury.

142
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,802
Miss Batts's land
will be returned to her.

143
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,275
- What about my timber?
He took it off my land and sold it!

144
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,641
- You would not have allowed

145
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,409
the cutting of the wood
had you not received that money

146
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,245
and the use of the slave.

147
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,807
- But he broke church law.

148
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,615
- You have the $100
and Samuel.

149
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,316
The profit on the land
is John Bell's.

150
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,448
His loss,

151
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,427
the loss of his good name...

152
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,995
... is punishment enough.

153
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,001
- That's not fair!

154
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,841
That's their punishment for you,

155
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,574
John Bell.

156
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,776
Just wait until you see mine.

157
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,978
- Witchery can't touch me, woman.

158
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,645
- Treasure your land,

159
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,883
health and happy family

160
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,584
while you can.

161
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,355
For I swear,

162
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,090
dreadful darkness
will fall upon you.

163
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,927
You...

164
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,934
... and your precious daughter too.

165
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,983
- Kate Batts...

166
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,650
... well, she was feared
by everyone in the village.

167
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,987
They were all convinced
she was a witch.

168
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,356
So the Bells took her cursing them
very seriously.

169
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,791
At the time,

170
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,994
I didn 't believe in curses,
ghosts or spirits.

171
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,194
I do now.

172
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,535
- John.

173
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,267
- Father, you all right?

174
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,569
- Yeah.

175
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,575
- We got it, Father.
- The wolf?

176
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,375
- Wolf?

177
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,040
We shot a deer.

178
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,419
Come see it, Father.

179
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,755
(low growling)

180
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,757
Father!

181
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,392
- I heard it.

182
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,765
- Back there.

183
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,772
(low growling)

184
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,788
(growling)

185
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,803
- Keep your eyes peeled,
it's black as night.

186
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,313
(growling)

187
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,848
(growling)

188
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,500
(snarling)

189
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,009
(growling)

190
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,352
(thumping)

191
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,158
(young boy):
Momma! Momma! Momma!

192
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,994
- Oh, let me hold you.

193
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,566
(panting)

194
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,767
(banging)

195
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,036
(growling)

196
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,580
(panting)

197
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,707
(growling)

198
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,189
(crashing)

199
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,609
- Betsy, what was that crash?
- Mother, there's something in my room!

200
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,651
There's something in my room!

201
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,886
- Oh, the wind blew the window open.
I'll close it.

202
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,388
- No! There's something in here.

203
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,117
It got inside.

204
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,794
- Well, there doesn't seem
to be anything in here now, Betsy.

205
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,764
It was probably just mice, darling.

206
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,595
- I don't think so, Mother.

207
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,401
- Let's go find your brothers.

208
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,837
Come along.

209
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,813
(snarling)

210
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,648
Let's go find that big, scary mouse!
(boys):. Yeah!

211
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,188
(footsteps)

212
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,954
(door creaking)

213
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,256
- Everyone all right?

214
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,799
- We're fine.

215
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,425
Let's get back to bed.

216
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,803
You could have killed us.

217
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,607
- Yeah, it was young John.

218
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,945
- He shot a musket into the house.
- It discharged accidentally.

219
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,110
- He shot a musket
into the house, John!

220
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,984
- We were taken aback.

221
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,330
I can't get Kate Batts
out of my head.

222
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,856
- What's done is done!

223
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,961
The church has had its say
and that's that,

224
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,506
so just put it out of your mind!

225
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,522
(whispering sound, building)

226
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,533
(eerie music)

227
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,215
(eerie, discordant sounds)

228
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,744
- Now, class,
who were the couriers

229
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,383
ordered to ride to Concord
to warn that the British were coming?

230
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,018
Yes, Theny.
- Paul Revere,

231
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,893
Samuel Prescott and William Dawes.
- Right, Theny.

232
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,091
And did they succeed, Betsy?

233
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,226
Betsy?

234
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,898
All right, class,
let's leave this for a moment.

235
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,373
It's time for your physical exercise
anyway. Fifteen minutes now!

236
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,535
Fifteen minutes only.

237
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,413
You all right, Betsy?

238
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,888
- I'm tired.

239
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,983
Our house makes...
strange noises at night.

240
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,928
It's hard to sleep.

241
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,463
(child):. Pass it to me, quick!

242
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,387
(creaking)

243
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,166
(creaking)

244
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,206
- Betsy!
- Betsy? You hurt?

245
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,013
- W-where'd she go?
- Who?

246
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,350
- The girl who was swinging with me.

247
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,356
- You were swinging alone, Betsy.

248
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,359
(crying)

249
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,434
- Did you see a girl?
- No.

250
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,612
("screaming")

251
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,078
(clomping)

252
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,652
(creaking)

253
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,632
(creaking)

254
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,170
(creaking)

255
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,418
(gasping)

256
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,546
(panting)

257
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,860
(blowing sound)

258
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,163
(heavy-breathing sound)

259
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,254
(screaming)

260
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,031
- Betsy! I'm here, darling.
- Momma! Momma!!!

261
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,702
Momma!!!!!!!! Momma!!!!!!!!!!
- It's me! Betsy!

262
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,938
- Momma!!!!!!!!!!!
- Betsy, Momma's here!

263
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,310
- Momma!!!!!
(John):. Betsy!!

264
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,973
Betsy! Betsy.

265
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,610
- It touched me.
- Where?!

266
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,054
Who touched you?
- I don't know.

267
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,455
I couldn't see.

268
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,721
(John exclaiming)
- It was just a bad dream, darling.

269
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,627
- But it was so real.

270
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,898
- It's all right, John.

271
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,936
She's had a bad dream.

272
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,901
- Let's just get you back to sleep.

273
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,108
It was just a dream.

274
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,755
- It wasn't a dream.

275
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,763
There was someone on the roof.
- What?

276
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,733
- I think maybe Kate Batts
sent one of her slaves to torment us.

277
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,269
When I find him--
- John!

278
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,670
- --I'll whip him
to within an inch of his life!

279
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,139
- My God.
- What?

280
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,142
- John, look at this.

281
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,610
- That sonofabitch!

282
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,772
- John!

283
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:23,939
John!!

284
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,483
John... Wait.

285
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,114
John!

286
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,781
Stop. We don't know
who did this!

287
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,450
- I know who did this!
- You don't!

288
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,825
Listen to me!
- Batts is not gonna hurt my daughter.

289
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,989
- Oh, go on, then! Be a fool!

290
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,178
- What are the two foundations
of any civilized community?

291
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,185
- Church and--
- Church and education, that's what.

292
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,552
And this man pioneered them both
for our community,

293
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,183
with his money and with his hands.

294
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,693
- He built the church
and the church condemns him.

295
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,196
- Usury. I broke church law.

296
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,357
- But, Father--
- Moral turpitude.

297
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,697
- Moral turpitude, pah!

298
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,737
He charged a rate of interest

299
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,773
that was just a little higher
than church canon.

300
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,209
But what the elder didn't realize
was who he was dealing with!

301
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,711
- Shhh, James.

302
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,044
The boys are finally asleep.

303
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,709
- Th-that's good. Bless their...

304
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,980
Now, a few chapters...

305
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,715
from the Bible

306
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,054
will take care
of this house's troubles.

307
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,592
- Quietly, James.

308
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,090
- "Hannah prayed and said,

309
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,431
" 'My heart exalts in the Lord...

310
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,062
"My mouth is enlarged
over mine enemies...'

311
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,835
" 'Who am l?
An untamed spirit that spoke to him

312
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,571
"and Jesus answered,

313
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,942
" 'Be silent

314
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,414
"and come out of there.'

315
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,917
"The spirit gave a loud cry

316
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:41,781
and departed."

317
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,754
Please...

318
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,290
all join hands.

319
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,596
As one,
we shall speak this prayer

320
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,098
three times.

321
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,363
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

322
00:28:58,436 --> 00:28:59,801
be silent

323
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:03,432
and leave this house forever.

324
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,944
(all):. Demon,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

325
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,774
be silent

326
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,611
and leave this house forever.

327
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,947
Demon, in the name

328
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,781
of Jesus Christ,

329
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,687
be silent
and leave this house forever.

330
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,521
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

331
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,391
be silent
and leave this house forever.

332
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,986
(thunder)

333
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,368
Almost 12:00

334
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,931
and all is well.

335
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,307
I believe your home is safe.

336
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,074
- I'm sure Kate Batts
is at the root

337
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,342
of these disturbances.
- Yeah.

338
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,855
- A few nights ago,

339
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,357
I saw something.

340
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,359
A man, I think.

341
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,191
Moving about the property.

342
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,323
- Who was he?

343
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,094
- Couldn't make out for sure.

344
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,262
- Was probably the professor.
He's the only one who lives nearby.

345
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,669
- You don't think Richard
has his eye on Betsy, do you?

346
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,208
- He's her teacher,
for goodness sake.

347
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,174
(clock chiming)

348
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,837
Hallelujah, Lucy.

349
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,780
God has answered.

350
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,285
It's midnight
and your house is quiet.

351
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,649
- Thank you, James.

352
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,848
- I beat him, Lucy.
- Oh, did you?

353
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,186
(laughing)

354
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,624
Oh, good night, all.
- Good night, dear.

355
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,685
- Good night.
Now, I wasn't looking, John.

356
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,561
I was talking to your wife.
That game don't count.

357
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,122
- Don't you blame that on me!

358
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,533
(James laughing)
- I'll set for another one.

359
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,298
- Ain't gonna play
if you're gonna cheat.

360
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,633
- I never cheat.

361
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,537
My move.

362
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,704
(rattling)

363
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,485
(panting)

364
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,329
(screaming)

365
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,505
(panting)

366
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,604
(screaming)

367
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,444
- Ahhhh! Dad! Daddy!!

368
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:28,776
(screaming)

369
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,918
- Open the door!
(John shouting)

370
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,017
(Betsy screaming)

371
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,596
(Lucy): Betsy!!!

372
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,795
(John): Open the door!!

373
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,432
(slapping sound)
(screaming)

374
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,476
- Help me!!!!!!

375
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,670
Help me!!!!! Help!!!!!!!

376
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,210
- In the name of Jesus Christ,

377
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,013
cease this at once!

378
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,315
(John):Oh...
- It's all right.

379
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,639
(shrieking)

380
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,308
- Demon, ghost,

381
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,107
entity - call it what you will,

382
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,545
it is not natural.
- James, James,

383
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,105
Iisten to yourself.
You're not being realistic.

384
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,946
(James sputtering)

385
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,385
There must be a rational explanation.

386
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,751
- Listen, Richard,

387
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,552
I have documented evidence.

388
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,185
It's the testimony
of Joan Jordan

389
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,728
at the witch trial

390
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,765
of Olive Barthram,
Suffolk Assizes,

391
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:56,231
of 1599.

392
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,665
First,

393
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,930
scraping on the walls.

394
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,062
Then, knocking.

395
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,766
After that, shuffling.

396
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,968
And then, it clapped the maid

397
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,238
on the cheek...

398
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,972
half-a-score times.

399
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,440
- Do you not think

400
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,212
it is far more likely

401
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,719
that Kate Batts,
unhappy with the ruling,

402
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:21,020
has sent her slaves to exact
a pound of flesh from you?

403
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,322
- Well, that's what I thought,

404
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,454
but this was not the work of slaves.

405
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,329
- Lord, no!
She was dangling there!

406
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,630
Two feet off the ground!

407
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,066
- All right.

408
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,471
The incidents
always happen at night

409
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,272
and always in Betsy's room.
Correct?

410
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,711
- That's right, Professor.
- So it was dark.

411
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:47,774
Well, it would've been quite easy
for you not to have seen

412
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,412
someone holding her.
- She was suspended in midair

413
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,786
by something not of this Earth!
- John!

414
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,884
Now, the only logical explanation
is that someone was holding her.

415
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:00,021
- There was nobody in that room.

416
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,793
- And what about the door?

417
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,232
The strength of three of us
couldn't budge it.

418
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,963
- Well...

419
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,665
the rain that night
could've cause the door to swell.

420
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,371
- It could've.

421
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,307
- And the slaps?

422
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,311
How did we imagine them?

423
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,246
- Now, that's a boy's trick.

424
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,183
Dried peas
blown through a hollow reed.

425
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,344
- A pea shooter?

426
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,751
- Huh!
- No pea shooter

427
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,186
could smack her face

428
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,416
that violently.

429
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,823
- Did you actually see
someone slapping her?

430
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,691
- No, I saw her being slapped.

431
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,253
- But you did not see
someone slapping her?

432
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,766
- No, that's the point.
- So it stands to reason

433
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,166
you may also not have seen
someone holding her.

434
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,267
Now, whatever happened,

435
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:48,278
it's very clear
that confusion was about that room.

436
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,338
- Professor, we did not all imagine
the same thing.

437
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,544
- There was something unholy

438
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,678
in that room.
- John...

439
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,682
... when the school week is over,

440
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,319
I will come and spend the night
at your house

441
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:08,331
and I will prove to you
that this is nothing more

442
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,560
than someone
trying to frighten you.

443
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,484
(bell tinkling)
All right, time's up, class.

444
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,925
Leave your slates
on my desk, please.

445
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,655
- Betsy.

446
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,393
Hurry up.

447
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,901
We gotta get to the river
before it gets dark.

448
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,733
- Not today, Joshua.

449
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,069
- We've been planning this for weeks.

450
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,439
- I just don't feel like it.

451
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,774
- Come on, Betsy.
- I said no!

452
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,747
Leave me alone!

453
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,133
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

454
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,293
- This will pass, Betsy.

455
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,984
(screaming)

456
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,028
- Why?

457
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,262
Why?...

458
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,546
(child): Give that back!

459
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,293
(gasping)

460
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,054
- Remember what?

461
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,578
(ominous music)

462
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,127
(door creaking)

463
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,579
(creaking)

464
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,735
(panting)

465
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:04,593
- No!

466
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,890
No.

467
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,362
(banging)

468
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,833
Shhh!
- No, no!

469
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,741
- No! Don't!

470
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,405
(John): Lucy, what's happening?!

471
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,849
(Lucy): What's happening?

472
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,078
- Richard, you should not be watching.
- Somebody wake her!

473
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,280
- Oh!
- John!

474
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,387
(door creaking)

475
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,695
(water pouring)

476
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,295
- Open your eyes, John.

477
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,872
- He'll be all right in the head
come morning, Miss Bell.

478
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,377
- And the poultice?

479
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,744
- He keep them roots
on his head a while.

480
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,410
- Well...

481
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:07,048
Betsy appears to suffer
from violent nightmares.

482
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,820
- Did you see my sister?

483
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,555
- Of course.
- You think what my daughter

484
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,926
just went through--
- Bear with me

485
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,625
for a minute here--
- The covers were pulled off her bed!

486
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,996
That was no nightmare.

487
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,195
- Nightmares may appear
to be more than they are.

488
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,295
People often imagine

489
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,397
they've seen--
- We didn't imagine any of this!

490
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,840
You were there, you saw it!

491
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,743
It was not natural!
- There's something evil here.

492
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,416
- This is blasphemy!

493
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,017
- Who's there?

494
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,250
Show yourself!

495
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,088
- Betsy, is that you?

496
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,821
- Destroy them, O Lord!

497
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,921
Let them fall by their own counsel!

498
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,659
- Quiet, James!

499
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,133
- Destroy them! Destroy them!

500
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,870
Cast them out!
- Can you see anyone?

501
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,807
- A multitude of their...
- Who is that?

502
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,777
- O Lord,
they have rebelled against thee!

503
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,813
Cast them out!
- Stop that, James!

504
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,950
- The foolish shall not stand!

505
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,918
They shall not stand

506
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,454
in thy sight!

507
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,319
Cast them out! Cast them--

508
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,391
Stop it!!

509
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,699
Damn you to hell!!

510
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,006
- Are you familiar
with that which Mr. Johnson reads?

511
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,710
- Of course it understands
the words of the Lord.

512
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,547
That's why it's gone.

513
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,814
(noise)

514
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:55,721
- Was the reading
from the Gospel According to Matthew?

515
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,733
(noise)

516
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,735
- Was that a yes...

517
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,270
or a no?

518
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,703
- Shhh!

519
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,936
The Gospel According to Mark?

520
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,205
(noise)

521
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,509
- Is it a Psalm of David?

522
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,210
(loud noise)

523
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,891
Why are you here?

524
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,961
Have the Bells disturbed you?

525
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,279
- Are we all having nightmares now,
Professor?

526
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,813
- My mess. I'll clean it.

527
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,001
(knocking)

528
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,007
- Anky, could you answer
the door, please?

529
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,542
- Yes, ma'am.

530
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,443
- Hi, Anky.
- Zach.

531
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,848
What you doing here?

532
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,284
- Miss Batts told me

533
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:06,720
to bring this bag to the Bells.
She say she found it on her land.

534
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,727
Bye, Anky.
- Bye, Zach.

535
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,892
- Who was it, Anky?

536
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,456
- It was Zach, ma'am.

537
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,661
- Who works for Kate Batts?
- Yes'm.

538
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,534
She give him this bag
to give to you.

539
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,040
- I don't want anything of hers
brought into this house.

540
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,736
- She say it belong
to the Bell family.

541
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,301
- No, Mom.

542
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,461
- This is Betsy's.
- Yes, Miss Lucy.

543
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,523
And that be Mr. Bell's shirt.

544
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,662
They's been missing for over a year.
- Why would she have their clothes?

545
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,635
What is it, Chloe?

546
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,113
What do you know?

547
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,447
Tell me what you know.

548
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,016
- You heard about Miss Kate
being a witch and all.

549
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,081
Well, Miss Lucy,

550
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,093
when witches
get a critter's blood on folks' clothes,

551
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,924
why, that mean

552
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,329
the person gonna...

553
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,994
- Gonna what, Chloe?

554
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,469
Gonna what?

555
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,597
- Gonna...

556
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,074
Gonna die, Miss Lucy!

557
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,337
Gonna die!

558
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,210
- I'll burn it!!

559
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,544
- No, Miss Lucy!!

560
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,777
That'll make it worse.

561
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,514
They're gonna let the devil in!

562
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,558
(eerie music)

563
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,827
(children shouting)

564
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,492
- Hey, come on, come on!

565
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,196
Hey, give it back!

566
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,503
("angelic" music)

567
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,045
- Stop! Wait!

568
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,239
Please, stop!

569
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,411
(water dripping)

570
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,083
(screaming)

571
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,962
- You're having a nightmare!

572
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,609
(breathing heavily)

573
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:21,974
It's all right.

574
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,812
It's all right.

575
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,482
It's all right.

576
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,456
What happened?

577
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,991
- I don't remember.

578
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,987
I never remember.

579
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,294
- Should I wake your parents?
- No!

580
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:46,631
Please.
Please just stay here with me.

581
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,170
- Of course, Betsy.

582
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,172
Let's get you covered up.

583
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,093
(coughing)

584
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,766
- John!

585
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,443
- I'll kill her. I'll kill her!
- No, John.

586
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,812
When they hang you for her murder,
what happens to us?

587
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,350
- You won't be any worse off

588
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,112
than you are already--

589
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,676
- John, I want to have you,
John Bell!

590
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,552
- But sacrificing my life
could end this torment!

591
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,057
(coughing)

592
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,556
- We'll find another way, John.

593
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,567
We'll find another way.

594
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,866
- Theny?

595
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,373
- Yes, Betsy?

596
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,841
- Do you believe in the Lord?

597
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,538
- Of course I do.

598
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,705
Don't you?

599
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,612
- I used to.

600
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,449
- Oh, Betsy.

601
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,685
- I'm so afraid.

602
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,089
- Don't be.

603
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,558
I'm here with ya.

604
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,492
Good night, Betsy.

605
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,965
- Good night.

606
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,127
(whisper): Betsy...
(echoing)

607
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,661
- Did you hear that?

608
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,844
(whisper): Betsy...

609
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,438
Betsy...

610
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,783
(gasping)

611
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,672
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...

612
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:10,937
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...

613
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,979
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...!

614
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,228
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...!

615
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,629
Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...!

616
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,223
- Let me out!

617
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,462
Let me out!!!!

618
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,299
Let me out!

619
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:37,670
- Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...!
- Let me out!!!

620
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,836
- Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...!
(Theny screaming)

621
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,839
Betsy...

622
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,983
(Theny whimpering)

623
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,756
- How long has she been this way?

624
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,160
- Uh, maybe 30 minutes,

625
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,529
hmm?
- No, more than that.

626
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,501
- Theny?
(Theny whimpering)

627
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,199
Can you tell us what happened?

628
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,208
- It's all right, Theny.

629
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,413
- She was having a nightmare.

630
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,951
She was...

631
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,782
fighting with someone.

632
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,378
She started...

633
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,390
hitting herself.

634
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,926
I woke her up and then...

635
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,696
... then this...

636
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,129
voice--

637
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,632
(screaming)

638
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,896
- Betsy! Betsy, you're all right.

639
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,233
Shhh...

640
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,744
Shhh...

641
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,487
Betsy! Betsy! Come on!

642
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,218
Come here, come here!
Shhh! Shhh!

643
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,816
Shhh! Here, look at me.

644
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:05,554
Look at me, look at me!

645
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,425
Shhh, shhh.

646
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,452
- Betsy...

647
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,017
- Did you hear it?
- Shhh...

648
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,290
(whisper): Bad
(knocking sound)

649
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,101
(whisper): John Jr...

650
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,008
Theny...

651
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,944
Lucy...

652
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,312
John Bell...

653
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,611
Tell me the truth...
(plaintive cry)

654
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,280
- What is it, Lord?
- Cease this at once!!!

655
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,983
(plaintive crying)

656
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,922
(different disembodied voices):
- You're gonna die...

657
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,661
- Make him pay.
- No, no, no...

658
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,970
(disembodied laughter)

659
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,873
- Who are you?
(whisper): She'll sadden one

660
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,140
who was once happy...
- Go to hell, Kate Batts!

661
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,646
(babbling of disembodied voices)

662
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,875
(screaming)

663
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,053
- Precious! Oh!
- Oh!

664
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,159
(Betsy screaming)

665
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,892
- No! Betsy, no!

666
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,092
Betsy! No! No!

667
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,671
Betsy!!!!!!!
- No!

668
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,707
- Stop!!! No!!

669
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,356
(Professor): It spoke.

670
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,861
It had a voice.

671
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,122
But what did it want?

672
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,531
Why was it making Betsy suffer so?

673
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,539
What did she do
to make it so angry?

674
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,131
The black wolf?

675
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,869
The young girl,

676
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,207
visible only to Betsy;,

677
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,440
the spirit
which none of us could see.

678
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,110
How did they relate to each other?
Were they one and the same?

679
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,583
The attacks on Betsy got worse.

680
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,145
It spoke more and more.

681
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,657
I tried to get it to tell us

682
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,626
why it had come.

683
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,595
My questions
were answered with silence.

684
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,723
Why wouldn 't it answer?

685
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,148
- In my life...

686
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,124
I've done far more good than not.

687
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,759
Even saints...

688
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,626
commit sins of some sort.

689
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,669
How can you allow...

690
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,898
my family...

691
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,999
to be punished like this?!

692
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,601
It's the way of Satan!

693
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,615
I've offered you my life...

694
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,177
in recompense.

695
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,219
Why do you not take it?

696
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,025
I beg you.

697
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,621
I beg you, Lord.

698
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,166
Rid us of this curse.

699
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,397
Take my life.

700
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,815
The Lord has forsaken me, Richard.

701
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,354
(coughing)

702
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,025
- That which attacks Betsy...

703
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,394
attacks you as well.

704
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,007
"Someone who was once happy."

705
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,578
To whom do you think that refers?

706
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,545
- Kate Batts.

707
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,678
Everything points to her.

708
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:01,212
- Well, look, if she is the cause,
than why not just return the profit

709
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,383
and the timber to her?
- I tried.

710
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,028
Two months ago.

711
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,563
I sent Chloe to see her.

712
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,566
Money in hand.

713
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,870
She sent it back.

714
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,904
- Then she does mean
to torment you.

715
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,103
- Until I die.

716
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,376
- This...

717
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,545
entity...

718
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,987
... do you believe
it can read your mind?

719
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,581
- No, I do not.

720
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,221
No.

721
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,387
But I do believe it can...

722
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,055
hear our conversations.

723
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,224
That's how it knows
our every move.

724
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,427
- But it is only present
on this property.

725
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,807
(horses whinnying)

726
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,279
- Yah! Yah!

727
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,940
(horses whinnying)
- You know,

728
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,110
the fog is awfully thick.
- We made good time.

729
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,155
We should be out of the woods soon.

730
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,290
(whispery breathing sound)

731
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,636
(screaming)

732
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,189
(panting)

733
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,713
Whoa!!

734
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,007
- Betsy!!

735
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,211
Betsy!!!!

736
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,744
Betsy! Can you hear me?

737
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:27,285
(horse neighing)
- Whoa! Whoa!

738
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,455
Whoa!

739
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,595
Go!!
- Come on!

740
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,528
(Betsy): It's getting closer!

741
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,550
(Betsy panting)

742
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,179
It's gone.

743
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,280
- Gone where?

744
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,338
(horse whinnying)

745
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,488
- Mother?

746
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,353
- I'm right here, darling.

747
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,158
- I had the most terrible nightmare.

748
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,491
- Shhh.

749
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,930
- You were sending me away.

750
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,093
- Oh, I would never send you away.

751
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,427
- Mother?

752
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,199
- Yes, darling?

753
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,706
- Am I gonna die?

754
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,607
- No.

755
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,201
You're not gonna die.

756
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:27,715
Now, you just rest.

757
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:31,617
Just rest.

758
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,592
- If this entity...

759
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,893
... can hear us at all times...

760
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,900
... and is in all places...

761
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,866
- Then...

762
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,066
there's no escaping it.

763
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,214
- You care for her,
don't you, Richard?

764
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,376
More than the normal concern
of a teacher for a student.

765
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:13,219
- Why would you say that?

766
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,592
- I've seen you look at her.

767
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:22,562
- It is true,

768
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,368
there is no one for a day's ride

769
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,272
as comely as your daughter, Lucy.

770
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,744
I would not presume to--

771
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,145
- Maybe you should.

772
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,426
- I'm almost 20 years her senior.

773
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,327
- The same is true of John and me.

774
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,264
- Can she love me?

775
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,871
- She will.

776
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:08,540
I'm so afraid for her.
Richard, please, marry her.

777
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:12,018
- Your faith in me
is flattering, Lucy.

778
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,953
- Please.

779
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,458
- But I could not,

780
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,323
with good conscience,

781
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:23,695
marry Betsy
merely to be her protector.

782
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,899
I'm sorry.

783
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:32,340
I'm sorry.

784
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,980
After that night,

785
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,316
something changed.

786
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,753
The attacks on Betsy
became less violent.

787
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,687
The entity now took out its rage

788
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,887
on John,

789
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,261
while leaving Betsy
in an almost lifeless state.

790
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,357
(whisper): John...
(echoing)

791
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:00,899
John...

792
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,369
I'll kill you
John...

793
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:05,699
John...

794
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,537
John... Help her...

795
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,378
Help her, John...

796
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,075
She's so young... John...
(child): No!

797
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,380
No!
- Help her... She's so young...

798
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,215
- Help her...
- Precious.

799
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,084
- Help her...
- Oh!

800
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,019
- You're gonna die...

801
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,068
(whispering voices)

802
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,071
You're gonna die, John...
Yes...

803
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,904
(whispery laughter)

804
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,413
(different disembodied voices):
- Precious...

805
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,347
- Your precious...
- Precious...

806
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,885
- Once sad...

807
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:54,286
(Professor): The entity
wouldn 't let anyone try to help Betsy

808
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,153
when she was under its control.

809
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,256
I felt powerless.

810
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,230
John wouldn 't listen.

811
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:06,734
He fought it.

812
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,430
And in return,
he was made to suffer.

813
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,114
(creaking)

814
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,193
(whisper): You know...

815
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,592
the truth...

816
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:34,959
(echoing)

817
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:38,764
See?...

818
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,173
(shouting)

819
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,181
- Open the door!!

820
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,944
Betsy!!!

821
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,816
Betsy.

822
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,328
(wailing)

823
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,693
- Momma...

824
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,855
Help me.

825
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:48,535
- Betsy?!

826
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,771
(moaning)

827
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,754
(door creaking)

828
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,399
(roaring sound)

829
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:17,086
- Kate Batts!

830
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:27,099
Call back your Furies.

831
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,795
Spare my family.

832
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,471
Take it.

833
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:43,778
Exact your pound of flesh.

834
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:49,847
I beg you.

835
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,827
End your curse.

836
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,227
Please.

837
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,394
- I put no curse on you,

838
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,870
or your family.

839
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,169
You cursed yourself,

840
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,731
John Bell.

841
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:01,726
(click)

842
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,300
- Oh...

843
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,589
(ominous music)

844
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,596
(crying)
(click)

845
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,927
(sobbing)

846
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,411
(whisper): Betsy...

847
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,947
Betsy...

848
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,410
Help me...

849
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,076
(child crying)

850
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,278
Betsy...

851
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,753
(crying child): Help me...

852
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:01,413
- Remember...

853
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,915
(screaming)

854
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,055
(screaming)

855
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:27,374
- Precious.

856
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,550
- Momma!

857
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,032
(thunder)

858
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:28,561
My mom always was a heavy sleeper.

859
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:38,434
(disembodied voices):
I was born from the union

860
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,134
of evil and innocence.

861
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,369
Part of her soul died

862
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,674
the night John took her innocence.

863
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,852
Avenge me.

864
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:02,029
Make him pay
for what he has done to us.

865
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,231
(choking cough)

866
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,403
- Take it.
- Thank you.

867
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,366
Well, you sleep so sound,

868
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,600
you don 't even feel me
get out of bed.

869
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,636
- This is Betsy's?

870
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,614
- My mess.

871
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,482
I'll clean it.

872
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:09,182
(Professor): After that night,

873
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,582
Betsy never heard
from the entity again.

874
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:12,881
- Mom?

875
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,454
Mom! Dad's here.

876
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,856
I'm leaving.

877
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,224
- Okay.

878
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:35,909
I love you.

879
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,808
- I love you too.
Bye, Mom.

880
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:49,981
(whisper): Help her!

881
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:04,401
- David?

882
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,064
David?!!

883
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:07,574
David!!!!!

884
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,435
(screaming)
