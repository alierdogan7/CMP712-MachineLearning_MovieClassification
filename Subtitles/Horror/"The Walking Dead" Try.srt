Hi.

Aiden was trying to save us

from a roamer,

All he had to do
was hold the door.

But he panicked.

67
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,827

Or they just didn't care.

00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,962
Noah, I had him.

00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,769
And if I didn't push back,

71
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,437

72
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,943

00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,588

88
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:22,907
<i>And I see a great deal.</i>

89
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,917
I almost left him out there.

90
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,520
Could have told a story.

91
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,658
What, you think I should have?

92
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,496
They don't know
what they're doing.

93
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:47,332
- Any of them.
- We'll show them.

94
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:50,469
I don't know if they can see it.

95
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:53,238
How things really are.
I don't know if they can yet.

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,574
- They haven't caught up.
- We have to be here.

97
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:59,614
- We have to.
- Yeah, we do.

98
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:03,182
But their rules,
we don't answer to them.

99
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:06,586

00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:59,230
I sent a casserole

104
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,233
We want her to see that.

105
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,474
Have you thought about Pete?

106
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,042

107
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,943
Yeah.

108
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,014
Talked to Sam some more.

109
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:21,387
He said his mom put a bolt
on the inside of his closet.

110
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,855
Tells him to lock
himself in sometimes

111
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,726
and not come out till morning.

112
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:30,231
<i>He said he can hear</i>
<i>his dad yelling,</i>

113

<i>things breaking, his mom crying.</i>

114
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,470
Last month it got quiet
right in the middle of it

115
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,473
and he went out and
found her on the floor

116
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:43,242
<i>unconscious, bleeding.</i>

117
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,745
Pete was just sitting
on the porch.

118
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:53,787
Why do you care
what happens to Jessie?

119
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,624
You know why.

120
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,828
And I know why you do.

121
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,736
Why?

122
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,338
I've seen you talk to her.

123

145
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:44,772
I saw her going out
one day with her rifle.

146
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:47,908

I asked.

160
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,845
I just feel like
I was asleep in there.

161
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:56,980
You were trying to
forget so you could try.

00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:59,483
- I don't want to forget.
- So don't.

163

It hasn't gotten better.
It won't.

173
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,734
Pete's a surgeon.

174
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,234
He's saved lives.

175
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,901

- How?

00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:12,644

it'll be from now on.

What happens when he

181
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,362
It's not his choice.

182
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,135
So what happens?

183
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,976
I kill him.

184
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,944
We kill him.

185
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:38,182
We don't kill people.

186
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,952
This is civilization, Rick.

187
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,319
Warning someone to stop or die,

188
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,688
- that is civilized nowadays.
- Oh.

189
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,393
So what? So we just
let him hit her?

190
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:50,861
We let him kill her?

191
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,763
No, we exile him
if it comes to that.

192
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,433
We do that, we don't
know when he comes back

193
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,201
and what he does to them.

194
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,403
Letting him go makes
this place vulnerable.

195
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:04,603
You really want to wait till someone
in that tower has to take care of it?

196
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,274
- And that's if we're lucky.
- We are not...

197
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:10,376
executing anyone.

198
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:13,308
Don't ever suggest it again.

199
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,577
That sort of thinking
doesn't belong in here.

200
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,047
People die now, Deanna.
They do.

201
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:27,021
There's times like this
you can decide who and when.

202
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,090
Or it can be decided for you.

203
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,530
It already was.

204
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:37,098
I wouldn't kill you.

205
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:40,906
I'd just send you away.

206
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,852
Michonne: <i>Got it in
the back of the head.</i>

207
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:55,355
Had to be her.

208
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,671
Back of the head.

209
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,413
She's hunting them.

210
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:39,931
<i>(twigs snap)</i>

211
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,367
Enid:
<i>Carl.</i>

212
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:45,204
<i>I know you're following me.</i>

213
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:47,406
<i>Again.</i>

214
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:49,811
<i>And you're going the wrong way.</i>

215
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,017
You knew?

216
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,687
Enid:
<i>You're very loud.</i>

217
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:55,188
(twigs snap)

218
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,530
<i>Can you go back?</i>

219
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,802
<i>To be honest, you scare me.</i>

220
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:04,603
You shouldn't sneak out
by yourself.

221
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,505
Two people just died.

222
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,975
Oh, come on.

223
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:13,650
People always die.
You know that.

224
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,452
We should go back.

225
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:18,087
Why?

226
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,392
What do you do out here anyways?

227
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,396
Same thing as you.

228
00:20:51,156 --> 00:20:52,589
(snarling)

229
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,171

230
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,583
<i>(alarm ringing)</i>

231
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:42,233
Nicholas, don't talk,
just listen.

232
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,670
Those four people
you lost on that run,

233
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,472
that's on you.

234
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:51,236
And Noah, that's on you, too.

235
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:56,014
Those five lives,
you have to carry that.

236
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,219
People like you
are supposed to be dead,

237
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,555
but these walls
went up just in time,

238
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:05,424
so you're not.

239
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,160
You don't go outside
those walls anymore.

240
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:14,529
Not by yourself,
not with anyone else.

241
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,399
And that's how
you're gonna survive.

242
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:19,935
Who the hell
do you think you are?

243
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:23,404
I'm someone who knows
who you are.

244
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:28,210
I know what you did.

245
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:30,012
And it's not gonna happen again.

246
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,213
I've been protecting this place,

247
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:34,950
helping provide for it.
You just got here.

248
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:38,785
Don't forget what I said.

249
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,455
Are you threatening me?

250
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:44,862
(chuckles)
No.

251
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,698
I'm saving you.

252
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:04,858
(panting)

253
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:11,366
We're supposed to be out here.

254
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,037
We're supposed
to feel like this.

255
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:19,812
I don't want to forget.

256
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:27,421
And running
makes me feel better.

257
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,661
I can't forget.

258
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:34,230
I dream about it.

259
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:37,665
Being in the forest with them.

260
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,408
I do, too.

261
00:23:47,748 --> 00:23:50,986
Ron's a good guy.

262
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,887
He is.

263
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,623
Does he know you come out here?

264
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,125
No, I--

265
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:00,226
he wouldn't understand.

266
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:08,266
Why do I scare you?

267
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:10,366
I don't know.
You just do.

268
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,009
Cool knife.

269
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,648
It was my mom's.

270
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,283
What happened to you

271
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:27,317
before you got there?

272
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,386
Does it matter?

273
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,785
It does.
I know.

274
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:36,956
Something bad has
happened to me, too.

It's their world.

278
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:07,355
We're just living in it.

279
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:34,675
Cool.

280
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:36,607

I'm sick of playing defense.

288
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:06,700
So you're just gonna
take on all of them?

289
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,302
Yeah.

you can't do anything.

Noah.

I told him he wouldn't make it.

306
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,399

317
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:34,696
I don't want Ron and Sam

Well, your secret's safe.

319
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:45,409
Noah was a sweet kid.

It has to stop.

00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,165
- It will.
- How?

326
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,673
There are things in his
life that happened.

327
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:18,674
I don't care.

328
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:24,814
Look, it was like this
before and he got help.

329
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:26,816
I helped him

330
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,553
and things were good.

331
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,890
I can fix it.

332
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:35,894
No, you can't.
But I can.

333
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:39,698
No, what--
what can you do?

334
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,620
What are you gonna do?
You gonna put him in jail?

335
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,037
You're only gonna
make things worse.

336
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:50,774
If it's gotten worse,
it means he's killed you.

337
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,376
That's what's next.

338
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:55,011
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.

339
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:01,851
Why do you care?

340
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,520
Why is this so important to you?

341
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,093
Now?
You've made it.

342
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,460
You have a home for your kids.

343
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,197
Rick, what are you doing?

344
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,934
I'm trying to help.

345
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,602
I don't know that.

346
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:31,109
I'm married.

347
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:38,051
Okay? I can take care of myself.

348
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,719
We have to take care
of ourselves.

349
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,850
What are you doing?

350
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:48,488
You know Sam asked for a gun?

351
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,192
To protect you.

352
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,332
You shouldn't be here.

353
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:58,833
Jessie, in here,
you can't see it,

354
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,368
but it's the same.

355
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,337
It's the same as out there.

356
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,606
We have food and roofs
over our heads,

357
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:07,242
but you don't get to just live.

358
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:10,978
You don't get to put it off
or wish it away, Jessie.

359
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,482
If you don't fight, you die.

360
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:21,357
And...

361
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,194
and I don't want you to die.

362
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:30,030
I can--
I can help you.

363
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:33,701
I can keep you
and your boys safe.

364
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:38,971
I can.

365
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,612
All you have to do is say yes.

366
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:56,060
Would you do this
for someone else?

367
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,568
Would you do this for anyone?

368
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,916
No. No.

369
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:22,860
Yes.

370
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,000
Rick.

371
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:31,770
What are you doing here?

372
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,009
Pete.

373
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:39,079
What are you doing here?

374
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:45,584
- Listen to me.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, Rick.

375
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:50,388
No.

376
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:57,732
Excuse me?

377
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,766
You need to leave.

378
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:06,972
What are you talking about?

379
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:09,877
Just go, Pete.

380
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,747
What have you been
saying to each other?

381
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,919
Huh?

382
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,455
What have you been doing?!

383
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,356
Pete, you and me
are gonna leave now.

384
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:23,625
You come into my house...

385
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:26,196
Pete, you and me are leaving.

386
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,763
Pete: <i>You're leaving right now.</i>

387
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:30,066
You think you're the law?

388
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:33,103
You actually think you have
a say in anything here?

389
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,436
- Step back.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

390
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,402
Someone who's trying
not to kill you.

391
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:38,638
No!

392
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,840
- You wanna stop now!
- (shouts)

393
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,741
Come into my house?!

394
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:47,844
- Pete, stop it!
- It's my house!

395
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,480
Pete, stop it!

396
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:51,651
(shouts)

397
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,153
<i>(glass breaks)</i>

398
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:55,354
- <i> (fight continues)</i>
- Jessie:<i> No! Stop it!</i>

399
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:57,224
(shouting)

400
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,372
(snarling)

401
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,374
<i>(distant glass breaks)</i>

402
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,916
(screams)

403
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,457
(grunting)

404
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,924
Deanna!

405
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,986
Ah!

406
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,569
Dad, get off!

407
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:21,496
Deanna:
<i>Stop it!</i>

408
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,598
Stop it right now.

409
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:28,369
You touch them again
and I'll kill you.

410
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:30,638
Damn it, Rick!
I said stop.

411
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:34,212
Or what?

412
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,184
You gonna kick me out?

413
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,358
Put that gun down, Rick.

414
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,597
(panting)

415
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,071
You still don't get it.

416
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:54,873
None of you do!

417
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,873
(snarling)

418
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:03,311
Rick: <i>We know what needs
to be done and we do it.</i>

419
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:05,977
<i>(silenced gunshot)</i>

420
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,878
Rick: <i>We're the ones who live.</i>

421
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:18,185
You, you just sit
and plan and hesitate.

422
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:22,224
You pretend like you know
when you don't.

423
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:27,196
- (walkers snarling)
- (silenced gunshots)

424
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:30,669
Rick: <i>You wish things
weren't what they are.</i>

425
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,471
<i>Well, you want to live?</i>

426
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:36,441
<i>You want this place</i>
<i>to stay standing?</i>

427
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:38,242
(silenced gunshot)

428
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:40,344
Your way of doing
things is done.

429
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,682
Things don't get better
because you-- you want them to.

430
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,755
Starting right now,
we have to live

431
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,159
in the real world.

432
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:56,991
We have to control
who lives here.

433
00:41:58,027 --> 00:41:59,863
That's never been
more clear to me

434
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:02,000
than it is right now.

435
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:04,267
Me? Me? You--

436
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,935
(laughs)
You mean-- you mean me?

437
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:12,815
Your way is gonna
destroy this place.

438
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:14,862
It's gonna get people killed.

439
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:17,469
It's already gotten
people killed.

440
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:20,880
And I'm not gonna stand by
and just let it happen.

441
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,315
If you don't fight, you die.

442
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:26,825
I'm not gonna stand by--

443
00:42:28,577 --> 00:42:39,545
