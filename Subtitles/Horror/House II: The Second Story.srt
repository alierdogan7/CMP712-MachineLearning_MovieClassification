00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:47,198
(intense music)

3
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:55,389
(suspenseful music)

4
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,395
(baby crying)

5
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,770
- Clarence, they're here.

6
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,398
- [Clarence]
I'll be there in a minute!

7
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,442
(car honking)

8
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,694
- Clarence!
(baby crying)

9
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:51,321
- [Clarence] I hear ya!

10
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,947
(baby crying)

11
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,444
(car doors opening and closing)

12
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:02,790
(baby crying)

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,792
- Clarence, they're waiting!

14
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,169
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

15
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,872
(baby crying)

16
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:13,710
(suspenseful music)

17
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,954
(baby crying)

18
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:26,147
(woman weeping)

19
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:33,738
(baby crying louder)

20
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,799
(spurs clinking)

21
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,472
Clarence, could it be him?

22
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,343
- No, it's probably just those punks

23
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:05,478
who broke into Tivet's
house last Halloween.

24
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:10,675
(suspenseful music)

25
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:08,916
(door slams)

26
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,548
(spurs clinking)

27
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:16,466
(screams)

28
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:21,012
(intense music)

29
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,181
What do you want?

30
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,182
(growling)

31
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:27,185
- [Dark Figure]
I want the skull!

32
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,020
- I don't know where it is.

33
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:33,983
It's not here.

34
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,073
(intense music)

35
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:40,907
(gunshot fires)

36
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,243
(screaming)

37
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,281
(suspenseful music)

38
00:04:56,756 --> 00:05:00,634
- [Dark Figure]
Give me the skull.

39
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,222
- [Woman] No!

40
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,382
(gunshot fires)

41
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,114
- Wow.

42
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:23,991
I don't believe it.

43
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:29,247
- Oh, it's big, isn't it?

44
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,123
- Yep.

45
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,668
It's definitely not built to code.

46
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,053
- [Woman] How many generations
of your family lived here?

47
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,138
- [Man] I don't know.

48
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,873
(soft eerie music)

49
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,921
- Who decorated this place?

50
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:25,428
- Wow.

51
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,280
Looks like something's missing.

52
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,375
- Great.

53
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,794
I thought the electricity
was supposed to be on, Jesse.

54
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,046
- Yeah, it is.

55
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,380
The switch must be out.

56
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,049
(sighs)

57
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,426
- Is there a phone in here?

58
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,222
Great.

59
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,520
John Statmen, please.

60
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,229
- [John] Hello?

61
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,606
- John, hi! It's Kate.

62
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,273
- [John] Hey.

63
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,441
- Sorry I couldn't call you earlier.

64
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,276
The car phone doesn't work out here.

65
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,779
- [John]
What's the house like?

66
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,229
- Well, it's a pit,

67
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:27,397
but Jesse's completely
in love with it, of course.

68
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,283
(Kate and John laughing)

69
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,159
How'd the meeting go?

70
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,243
Is he interested?

71
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:32,996
No?

72
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,789
Great, you know, we
could have had him recording

73
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:36,624
in the studio by early next month.

74
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,334
Well, I don't know.

75
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,169
We've gotta find somebody fast.

76
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,255
Did you go see that new band
down at the Midas Club?

77
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:45,415
Yeah, they've kinda got a raw
energy, don't you think?

78
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,801
You're absolutely right.

79
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,012
Hey, did you get that letter from...

80
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,095
- [Jesse] I don't believe it.

81
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,305
- [Kate]
Well, they really need someone...

82
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,599
- [Jesse]
That's my mom and dad.

83
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,100
(mystical music)

84
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,555
I was pretty cute.

85
00:07:55,559 --> 00:08:00,439
(Kate chatting)

86
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:03,819
That was my grandfather.

87
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,563
(Kate chatting)

88
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:11,492
So he must've been
my great-great-grandfather.

89
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,619
Jesse McLaughlin.

90
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,079
They named me after him.

91
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,025
(spurs clinking)

92
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:48,846
(suspenseful music)

93
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:26,150
(door rattling)

94
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:31,697
Oh!

95
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,033
(thudding)

96
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:35,993
Ooh.

97
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,122
(groaning)

98
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:40,998
- What on Earth where you doing?

99
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,542
- I couldn't sleep,

100
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:46,037
so I went downstairs
to just look around.

101
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,631
(car honking)

102
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:52,718
(laughing and shouting)

103
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:54,511
- What is that?

104
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,055
- I hate when you say that...

105
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:58,008
(laughing)

106
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,725
- You did!

107
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,186
(laughing)

108
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,104
- But I don't do it!

109
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,943
(laughing)

110
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,402
- Oh, my God.

111
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,520
(laughing)

112
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,489
- Quit it!

113
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,282
- Oh, oh.

114
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,775
(clears throat)

115
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,827
♫ Da, da, da, da

116
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:23,417
♫ Happy Birthday to you

117
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,794
♫ Happy Birthday to you ♫

118
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,755
- [Jesse] Oh, hey.

119
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,006
You didn't have to do this.

120
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,383
- [Male Visitor]
Sure, I did!

121
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,344
You're the only person I know
who's ever been famous, eh?

122
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,971
- Hardly famous, Char.

123
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,639
Nobody reads this magazine.

124
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,467
- Oh, well, you know,
I mean, I have to admit

125
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't look at the pictures,

126
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,688
I only read it for the interviews.

127
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,565
- What? No you don't!

128
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,808
(laughing)

129
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:50,568
- Hey, look at this couch.

130
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,603
Nice and comfortable, huh, Lana?

131
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:53,529
(squealing)

132
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:58,471
(laughing)

133
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:04,331
(percussive music)

134
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,666
- Right, right, right there.

135
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:06,875
Perfect.

136
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,459
- Here?

137
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,378
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:14,508
(loud new wave rock music)

139
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,721
(John talking)
(loud music)

140
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,471
- What...?

141
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,974
(John talking)
(loud music)

142
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,559
Can you hold on for just a second?

143
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,854
♫ I never knew till
we were face to face

144
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,026
♫ That I'd be taken up to hyperspace

145
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,948
♫ It seems so strange,
seems so strange

146
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:40,283
♫ I only touch you

147
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:45,747
♫ And then you move right through ♫

148
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,708
- Excuse me.

149
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:49,584
- Oh, hi, Kate! Hey!

150
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,961
Music too loud?

151
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,588
Didn't mean to bother you, really.

152
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,941
- What, what is this you're playing?

153
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:56,592
Who is this?

154
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,552
- [Lana] That's PuceGlitz
and the Avoiders!

155
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,971
- "Puce Glitz"?

156
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,889
- Yeah, that's my stage name.

157
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,140
- [Kate] This is you?

158
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,350
- Yeah, and I'm her manager.

159
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,769
(laughing)

160
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,596
Uh, Kate, I feel compelled to tell you

161
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,774
we are weighing several
offers from some big producers,

162
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,943
but to drop names would be tacky.

163
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,696
- But you don't have a contract yet?

164
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,739
I mean you haven't signed
anything yet, have you?

165
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,901
- [Kate] Have you?
- [Lana] Oh, no!

166
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,442
- [Lana] We don't believe in success.

167
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,029
- Yeah, we wanna make a lot of money

168
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:24,953
and be real famous, but no success.

169
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,114
- No, there's a very
subtle difference, you know.

170
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,210
- John, I've gotta get back to you.

171
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,670
I think I may have found what
we're looking for.

172
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,508
♫ Sweet sensation, ow

173
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,303
♫ Sweet vibration ♫

174
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:45,403
(curious music)

175
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,867
- Huh, they're different.

176
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,615
This one's got jewels in its eyes.

177
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,049
They're not the same skull.

178
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,385
- Hey, Jess, whatcha
doin' there, huh?

179
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,096
- Come on, Charlie, give it.

180
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:24,847
It's private.

181
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:25,806
- Hey, this is cool.

182
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:26,424
Looks like it's old.

183
00:13:26,424 --> 00:13:27,099
What is it?

184
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,183
- Come on, Charlie, give it.

185
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,102
- No, no, no, not until
you tell me what it is.

186
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,103
- It's nothing.

187
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,940
Promise you won't laugh?

188
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:36,650
- Yeah.

189
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:37,984
(scoffs)

190
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,319
- You'll never believe me anyway.

191
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:40,862
- Sure, I will.

192
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,657
Here, okay, here, take it.

193
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,992
- All right, see this guy?

194
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,910
It's my great-great-grandfather.

195
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:48,578
He has the same name as me.

196
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,790
He was an outlaw in the Old West.

197
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:52,666
- I'll buy that.

198
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,534
- Yeah, look at this skull
he's holding.

199
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,795
It's made completely out
of raw crystal

200
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,005
and this guy in the background,

201
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,250
this is Jesse's partner Slim Razor.

202
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,259
- [Charlie] Uh-oh.

203
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,513
- [Jesse] Now, he and Jesse
had a falling out over the skull

204
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,389
and became bitter enemies.

205
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,475
Slim died without ever getting
the skull from Jesse.

206
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,930
All right, now, look at this.

207
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,188
You see this skull?

208
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,475
Now, it's different from the one
here on the book, right?

209
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,567
I mean, this one has
got jewels in the eyes.

210
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,442
- [Charlie] Wait, wait a minute.

211
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,394
- But listen to this.

212
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,989
Okay, um, all right.

213
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:26,492
"Legend has it that
there was a second skull

214
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,911
"that had untold powers
that could unlock the mysteries

215
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,122
"of the universe
and bring eternal life

216
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:32,581
"to those who possessed it."

217
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,458
So the question is:

218
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:39,671
if this is the legendary second skull,

219
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,966
where is it?

220
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,305
- Why you askin' me?

221
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:48,764
I mean how am I supposed to know?

222
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:54,228
- Charlie, Charlie, there's
an old cemetery up on the hill.

223
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:57,982
Jesse was buried there in 1916.

224
00:14:58,525 --> 00:14:59,233
Now look here.

225
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,478
It says that when the Aztecs
buried their dead,

226
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,030
they wrapped the bodies in
several layers of cloth

227
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,325
and they surrounded them
with their weapons and jewels.

228
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,329
- It was worth millions?

229
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,037
Was it...

230
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:13,247
a lot?

231
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,122
- Yeah.

232
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,421
- I say let's go for it.

233
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:25,969
(groaning)

234
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,555
(dog howling)

235
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,474
There's nothin' down here.

236
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,350
(panting)

237
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,768
Let's quit.

238
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,188
I don't care if all the money in
the world is down here,

239
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,725
I just want some sleep.

240
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:41,107
I'm really tired.

241
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,779
(knocking wood)

242
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,579
- Charlie.

243
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:54,621
- Huh?

244
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:55,664
- We got it.

245
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,415
- Oh, no. No.

246
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:05,410
(groaning)

247
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,092
- [Jesse] Got it, Charlie?

248
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,093
- Yeah.

249
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,017
(groaning)

250
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,560
I give up.

251
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,604
I can't lift another thing up.

252
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,481
Please, let me die.

253
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,025
Please, let me die.

254
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:35,656
(eerie music)

255
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:50,420
(mystical music)

256
00:16:56,976 --> 00:17:01,855
(intense music)

257
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,392
- Charlie.

258
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,811
- Jess, Jess, what?

259
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:12,033
Come on,
I don't have time for this, Jess.

260
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,033
What's in there?

261
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,576
- Charlie.

262
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:18,581
(suspenseful music)

263
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,123
(roaring)

264
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,097
Help me, you idiot.

265
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,893
(growling)

266
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,396
(Charlie bellowing)

267
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:46,222
(groaning)

268
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,737
(shouting)

269
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,450
(gasping)

270
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,493
- Jesse!

271
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,913
It's me.

272
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,291
I'm your great-great-grandson.

273
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,501
- [Zombie Jesse] Huh?

274
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,494
- They named me after you.

275
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:06,795
My name is Jesse too.

276
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,957
(groaning)

277
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:09,798
(gasps)

278
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:26,147
- My great-great-grandson?

279
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:31,111
What year is it?

280
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:33,613
- I don't know.

281
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,159
- Now don't you mess with me, boy.

282
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,859
(gasps)

283
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,160
- 1986!

284
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,787
- [Charlie] October 30th.
- [Jesse] October 30th, 1986!

285
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,623
- Well.

286
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,874
(chuckling)

287
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,251
God damn!

288
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,129
You know,
I've been waitin' over 70 years

289
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,374
for some jackass to get
the sense to come dig me up.

290
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:53,750
(laughing)

291
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,168
Thank you, boy.

292
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:02,176
(mystical music)

293
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:11,068
Well, there she is.

294
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,863
There's somethin' special
about this old house.

295
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:16,990
Can't you feel it?

296
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,618
I can.

297
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:24,331
(suspenseful music)

298
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,376
- Hey, come on.

299
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,337
Let's go this way.

300
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,096
Where you going?

301
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:44,762
(mystical music)

302
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:45,894
- [Zombie Jesse] There.

303
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:03,870
Remember, boys,
this house is a temple,

304
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:08,833
as fantastic as any pyramid or
castle you'll ever see.

305
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,671
It don't know time or space or
any of that hogwash,

306
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,758
but the forces of evil
are always after this skull

307
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,760
and you gotta help me to protect it.

308
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,263
So don't let no one touch
the dang thing, you hear?

309
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,941
- [Jesse]
Here, you can sleep on this.

310
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:42,118
- Is this the way you treat family?

311
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,746
Makin' 'em hide down in the basement

312
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:47,114
like some slimy ol' lizard?

313
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,501
- Well, I'm sorry, I must
be out of practice.

314
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,044
I don't have any family, sir.

315
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,337
- Don't call me "sir."

316
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,005
I ain't no politician.

317
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,333
Heck, I'm your great-great-grandfather.

318
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,595
You can call me "Gramps."

319
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,640
That's what your granddaddy
used to call me.

320
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,144
- All right, Gramps.

321
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,609
Well, we better hit the hay.

322
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,443
- Yeah.

323
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,853
- But I'm not tired.

324
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,031
I don't need no sleep.

325
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,075
Well, let's get me cleaned up

326
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,819
and then we can go out on the town

327
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,703
and do a little high steppin'.

328
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,582
- I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

329
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,084
- Why not?

330
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,585
There's nothin' wrong with me.

331
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,296
- No, there's nothin'
wrong with you, but...

332
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:40,050
- Well, somethin's botherin' ya.

333
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,010
I can see it in your eyes.

334
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,638
Look, I'm just as fit as a fiddle.

335
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,556
I'm...

336
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:54,230
(sorrowful fiddle music)

337
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,935
Oh, no. Oh, no.

338
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,196
I'm supposed to be young again.

339
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,660
- Gramps, maybe you should...

340
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,289
- Look at me.

341
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:15,753
(sobbing)

342
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:20,339
I'm a 170-year-old fart,

343
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,469
a goddamn zombie.

344
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,474
- Well, you look really good for
a 170-year-old zombie,

345
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,927
Gramps, really great.

346
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:38,734
- Well, I ain't gonna die if
it's the last thing I do.

347
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,149
(sighs)

348
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:25,063
(mischievous music)

349
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,497
What in tarnation is it?

350
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,376
- Gramps, this is a 1986

351
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,169
Alfa Romeo Spider.

352
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,509
Zero to 60, 7.3 seconds.

353
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:52,591
(mischievous music)

354
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:02,108
(engine revving)

355
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:07,030
(wild bluegrass music)

356
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,531
Let it out slow.

357
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,034
There you go, real slow.

358
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:12,786
(tires squealing)

359
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,329
(wild bluegrass music)

360
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,705
- [Jesse] Charlie!

361
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:21,295
- [Gramps] Yeehaw!

362
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,089
(tires squealing)

363
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:26,049
(wild bluegrass music)

364
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:27,801
(sighs)

365
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,178
(laughing)

366
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,881
Look at them stars.

367
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:32,723
Woo!

368
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:38,477
You know, they were
clearer back in the old days.

369
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:43,775
Sometimes they were so bright,
you couldn't get to sleep.

370
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,485
(laughing)

371
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,571
- Well, you know, Gramps, it's the ozone.

372
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:49,823
I mean...

373
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,108
(laughs)

374
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:53,111
I mean, you know, insect repellents,

375
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:56,372
you know, under arm
deodorants maybe,

376
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:58,156
just a pinch of communism,

377
00:24:58,156 --> 00:25:00,083
(laughs) it's makin'
the stars fade away.

378
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,789
- You, you're drunk.

379
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,202
You're drunk.
(Charlie laughing)

380
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:10,260
(giggling)

381
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,177
- Whoa!

382
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:14,389
(laughing)

383
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:20,979
- I better drive.

384
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,356
(laughing)

385
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:22,981
(tires squealing)

386
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:26,851
(wild bluegrass music)

387
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:29,029
(tires squealing)

388
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:33,032
(wild bluegrass music)

389
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,661
(shouting and laughing)

390
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:41,499
(cackling)

391
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:46,430
(wild bluegrass music)

392
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,508
Oh, Charlie!

393
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,543
(laughing)

394
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:54,382
Charlie, I could...

395
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:56,932
Charlie?

396
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:03,897
(doorbell rings)

397
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,150
- Jesse, you old golf bag.

398
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,067
How are you?

399
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,320
- Uh, John, what are you doing here?

400
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,323
- Oh, well, your
beautiful lady informed me

401
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,492
that she's found
the Madonna of the 80's.

402
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,410
I thought I'd better come
by and check it out.

403
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,497
- Hey, I thought Madonna was the
Madonna of the 80's, huh?

404
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,374
(laughing)

405
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,541
- Very good.

406
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,997
Who's your friend, Bozo the Clown?

407
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,670
- No, Bozo the Death Machine.

408
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,332
- [Jesse] Uh, Charlie, Charlie,

409
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:31,466
this is John Statmen, Kate's boss.

410
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,761
He's the president of Heretic Records.

411
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:41,179
- Okay. Okay, Okay.

412
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,436
John Statmen. 'Course.

413
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,146
Hi. (laughs)

414
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,188
This is really a pleasure.

415
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,481
I'm really happy to meet you.

416
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,692
Charlie Coriell,
manager of Puce Glitz

417
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,027
and the Avoiders.
- [John] Kate!

418
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,863
- Ta da! Here she is.

419
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,146
- [John] Great, you have the tape?

420
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:54,864
- [Jesse] Where are you goin'?

421
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:55,949
- We're doing lunch.

422
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,742
John made a special
trip out here to meet Lana

423
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,361
and listen to her demo tape.

424
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:02,789
(giggling)

425
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,074
See you late, Jesse.

426
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,503
(television music)

427
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,208
- Isn't this great?

428
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,091
They just keep comin'
and comin' and comin'.

429
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,593
(laughing)

430
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,138
Where the hell they
all comin' from anyhow?

431
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,640
(laughing)

432
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,683
- Heck, I broke it.

433
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,932
- A brewski, Gramps.

434
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:27,105
- Thank you.

435
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,525
I hate this doggone box.

436
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,276
- Hello, I like this...

437
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,194
- It's got all them channels.

438
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,279
♫ I don't wanna grow up ♫

439
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,031
It's got nothin' interestin' to watch.

440
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,200
- Well, there I was right out
in the middle of Kansas

441
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,161
facing 500 crazy fanatics, heavily armed,

442
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,489
and me with only 15 soldiers.

443
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:46,365
- [Gramps] Now you take this
Ronald Reagan feller.

444
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,960
He sure is a pansy.

445
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,589
He wouldn'ta lasted 10 minutes
back in the old days.

446
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,041
- My dear young lady,
there comes a time

447
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,052
in every soldier's life when
he must stand or fall alone,

448
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,886
and if you knew the army,
you'd understand that he--

449
00:27:58,886 --> 00:27:59,596
(television clicks off)

450
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,182
- It wouldn't do no good to
tell you how it was,

451
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,892
you had to be there,

452
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,978
and all them movies
and books and crap,

453
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,189
they don't tell you how it really was.

454
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,273
It was rough.

455
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,816
- Well, I got a question for you.

456
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,943
What ever happened to Slim Razor?

457
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:21,743
- Slim Razor ain't part of
my vocabulary no more, son.

458
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,625
We had a disagreement about who
the skull belonged to.

459
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:31,711
- What did you do?

460
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,456
- I shot the scallywag is what I did.

461
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:37,926
Well, he took a shot at me first,

462
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,463
so I had to teach him a lesson,

463
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,306
and I left him to die
in the Mojave Desert.

464
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,893
- And that was that?

465
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,603
- Yeah, that was that.

466
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,234
- Gramps, did you ever rob
a stagecoach?

467
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:57,529
- Sure.

468
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:58,489
(laughing)

469
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,530
- All right.

470
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:00,656
- All the time.

471
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,950
(laughing)

472
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:06,830
I robbed a stagecoach once just
outside of Dodge City.

473
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,415
Now, every day at about 5:30
(nostalgic fiddle music)

474
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,459
it used to come into the bank
(nostalgic fiddle music)

475
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,921
with a bag of money that
would give an elephant a hernia.

476
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,925
We set up on both sides
of a little gorge

477
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,959
just outside of town
and when the stagecoach

478
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,131
come on through, 50...

479
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:24,432
(Gramps storytelling)
(nostalgic fiddle music)

480
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,841
And they chased me around them hills

481
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:31,061
and clean across the
border into Arizona territory,

482
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,689
and I ridin' for about two weeks

483
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,566
without ever gettin' out
of the saddle

484
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,568
tryin' to lose them fellers.

485
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,444
(laughing)

486
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,320
(nostalgic fiddle music)

487
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,814
There I was, holdin' them off

488
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,692
with just two bullets in a Winchester

489
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,493
and all of the sudden, I take an arrow

490
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,620
right through the leg, right there.

491
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,329
- [Charlie] Right.

492
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,997
- And another one just
under the shoulder,

493
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,447
ooh, right there.

494
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:55,170
The caves were never uncovered again

495
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,089
and there musta been
a billion dollars

496
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:01,008
in diamonds and jewels down there.

497
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,052
(chuckles)

498
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:05,137
Now, that's somethin'
I intend to search for

499
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,599
just as soon as I get rejuvenated.

500
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,267
(muffled music playing)

501
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:09,976
- Shh.

502
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:11,644
- What?

503
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,313
- I hear something.

504
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,266
- Yeah, it sounds like music.

505
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,779
(music grows louder)

506
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,781
What time is it?

507
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,649
- And bring back some more beer.

508
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:30,538
(loud honky-tonk music)

509
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,833
- [Charlie]
Hey, Mike, how's it goin'!?

510
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,094
- [Mike] Cool, Charlie, cool.

511
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,764
(loud honky-tonk music and chatter)

512
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,682
- [Voiceover]
I'm in the business, Bozo!

513
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,227
- I invited some people
over for Halloween.

514
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:58,232
I forgot. Sorry.

515
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,853
Enjoy!

516
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,479
Hey, Biff, how you doin'?

517
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,823
Hey, get over here!

518
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:10,453
(loud honky-tonk music and chatter)

519
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:23,257
- Guess who.

520
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,594
- Rochelle!

521
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,388
- Long time no see.

522
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,058
Oh.

523
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:37,646
(loud honky-tonk music and chatter)

524
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,565
- Uh, Kate...

525
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,569
- It's been so long since I've seen you.

526
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,699
- Yeah, it sure has.

527
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:52,328
- Excuse me, we need
to talk about something.

528
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,789
(laughter and chatter)

529
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,042
- How long you out here for?

530
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,661
(energetic bluegrass music)

531
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:01,004
- Like a week.
(energetic bluegrass music)

532
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,880
- [Gramps] Yee-haw!
(laughing)

533
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,802
(energetic bluegrass music)

534
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,310
- Would you hold this
trash for a minute?

535
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,061
- Sure.

536
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,227
- You look great.

537
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,150
- Now, I know some
people down in Hollywood.

538
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,653
- [Jesse] Charlie! Charlie.

539
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:25,153
- What?

540
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,487
- Look, Gramps.

541
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:27,822
What is he doin'?

542
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,951
- [Charlie] It looks like
he's about to score.

543
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,367
- [Jesse] Yeah, but
how did he get up here?

544
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:33,786
- Will you relax?

545
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,538
It's Halloween, he blends right in.

546
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,041

554
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:53,639

571
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:11,843

572
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,886
- Um, can I talk to you?

573
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:14,762

574
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:18,182
(suspenseful music)

575
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,308

577
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:21,936

580
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,041
Hey.

581
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,754
- You better pack your ass
in a suitcase

582
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,088
and head for Panama.

583
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,041

584
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,342

(growls)

587
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:58,765

588
00:34:58,765 --> 00:34:59,849

589
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:00,392

590
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:00,891

591
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,143
No, no, wait, please.

(thunder claps)

595
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:16,157

597
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,035

00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:50,565
(slams)

605
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:54,027
- Charlie, there's a jungle in there.

606
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:56,864
- Get you something---
(Kate hyperventilating)

607
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,408
- Valium! Get me Valium!

608
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,243
- Yeah.

609
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,494
(hyperventilating)

610
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,623
- Whiskey, get me whiskey.

611
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:14,673
I need the skull.

612
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,543
Without it, I'm a goner for sure.

613
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,470
Don't let him get away.

614
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,556
- Gramps, there's a jungle upstairs.

615
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,809
- And he took it in there.

616
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,136
He's from the Stone Age, kid.

617
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,604
You gotta stop him.

618
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,148
Don't worry, he's a pushover.

619
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,359
- Gramps, I don't think you understand.

620
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,694
There is a jungle!

621
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,365
- Jesse, in the wrong hands that
skull could cause trouble.

622
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:40,700
Now go.

623
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:47,331
(suspenseful music)

624
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:50,621
- [Jesse] Charlie.

625
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,347
(knocking)

626
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:05,683
Charlie?

627
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,351
- [Charlie] Hey!
(screams)

628
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,603
(laughing)

629
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:10,980
- Charlie, don't sneak up
behind me like that.

630
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,106
- Well, I just happened to have this

631
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:13,441
in the truck of the car.

632
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,067
Never know when you're
gonna need one in a pinch, huh?

633
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:15,985
(laughs)

634
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:16,684
- What is it?

635
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:20,323
- This is an Uzisemi-automatic
firing weapon.

636
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,366
- Charlie, this is a machine gun!

637
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:23,993
- So?

638
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:24,952
- So...

639
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,451
so what about me?

640
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:29,540
What do I get?

641
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,626
- I only had the one Uzi,
you know, but...

642
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,506
got one of these.

643
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:43,137
- What do I do with this,
light cigars?

644
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,181
- No, you shoot people with it.

645
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,177
Duh.

646
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:48,768
Okay.

647
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,269
(clear throat)

648
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,522
On the count of three
you're gonna kick the door open,

649
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,275
run in there blindly,
and I'll cover you, okay?

650
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,689
- Guy with the big gun goes first.

651
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,114
- Okay.

652
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,492
(sighs)

653
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,576
Ready?
- [Jesse] Yeah.

654
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,831
- [Jesse] One, two...
- [Charlie] One, two.

655
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:11,916
- [Charlie]
Just hold on, hold on.

656
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,417
(Uzi clacking)

657
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,418
Not yet.

659
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:19,381

660
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:22,385

662
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,888

668
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,279
- What are you doing!?

669
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,989
- [Charlie] Makin' sure
you're not dreamin'.

670
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:30,446

671

674
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,557
- Charlie.

675
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,770
(mystical music)

676
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,053
Nobody's home.

677
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,480
What do we do?

678
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,397
We need a plan.

679
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,528
- Yeah, let's get the skull
and get the hell outta here.

680
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,279
- Good plan.

681

Thanks, Charlie.

00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:38,229
Ooh!

706
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,311
- Where'd he go?

707
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,063
- He ran away with histail
between his legs,

708
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,355
chicken shit barbarian!

709
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,641

Don't lose it!

723
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,662
Jess, don't worry.

724
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:01,789
If you fall, you'll die real fast.

725
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:03,952

00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,345
What an idiot.

734
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:12,151
(Jesse groaning)

735
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:20,992
(screeching)

736
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,204
Shit.

737
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,831
(gasping)

738
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:29,209
- Ow!

739
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:31,712
Ow!

740
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:34,841
(screeching)

741
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:38,460
(panting)

742
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:41,930
Huh?

743
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,559
- Hey, Jess, lookin' good!

744
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,009
Wish I'd had a camera!

745
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:46,803
(laughs)

746
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:54,651
- Okay.

747
00:45:00,774 --> 00:45:02,700
Nice bird.

748
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,660
(squawks)

749
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,124
Nice birdie.

750
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:09,708
(squawks)

751
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:10,626
Jeez.

752
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,127
(laughs)

753
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:18,175
(animal grumbling)

754
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,554
All right.

755
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:23,965
(squawks)

756
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:25,099
(growls)

757
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,802
- Come on, Jess.

758
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,444
(squawking)

759
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:37,277
- Let go!

760
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:38,529
(growling)

761
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:42,657
(loud squawking)

762
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,373
(growling)

763
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:51,500
- Jess!

764
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,210
(shouting)

765
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,628
(screeching)

766
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:56,797
Jess, you get outta there!
(screeching)

767
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,507
Come on! Come on, Jess!
(screeching)

768
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:02,344
(growling)

769
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,179
Jess, it's comin' back!

770
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,932
Kick it! Come on, get it!

771
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,434
Aw, come on!

772
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:10,353
(screeching)
(screaming)

773
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:13,267
- [Jesse] Catch me! Catch me!
(screeching)

774
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,107
Charlie, catch me!
(screeching)

775
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:15,899
- [Charlie] I got it.

776
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:18,360
- [Jesse] Catch me!
- [Charlie] I got you, Jess!

777
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,280
(screaming)

778
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,907
(crashing)

779
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,199
- What the hell was that?

780
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:34,292
- It sounded like a bomb.

781
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,336
- Why didn't you use the stairs?

782
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:43,719
- Charlie, Charlie, you all right?

783
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,225
(groaning)

784
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,395
(animal snarling)

785
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:55,897
- [Charlie] I guess it's...

786
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,067
(groans)

787
00:46:58,817 --> 00:46:59,777
(screams)

788
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:00,610
- Jess, get him off me!

789
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,904
He's eatin' my leg!

790
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:03,531
He's eatin' my.
(screams)

791
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:04,656
Get it off me!

792
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:07,785
Jess, it's eatin' me alive!

793
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:12,456
(groaning)

794
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,414
(barking)

795
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,211
(laughing)

796
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:17,711
(barking)

797
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:20,130
- Charlie. Charlie!

798
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,214
(screams)

799
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:24,093
(barking)

800
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:25,878
(screams)

801
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:29,598
- Hey, hey.

802
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:30,717
(laughs)

803
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:31,433
(barks)

804
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,226
Hey, Jess, can we keep him?

805
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,687
- Well, who's gonna
take care of him, Charlie?

806
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:37,689
- I'll feed him,
change his water and stuff.

807
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,192
(screeching)

808
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:42,319
- Charlie, help me.

809
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,189
(screeching)

810
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:44,988
Charlie help me!

811
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:48,074
(barking)

812
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,576
- Don't forget the beer.

813
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,413
(screeching softly)

814
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,388
- [Jesse]
Come on. Come on.

815
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:12,224
Come on.

816
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:17,772
(grunts)

817
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:22,442
(screeching)

818
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,528
Get him.

819
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:28,114
(screeching)

820
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,496
- Hey, Jesse?

821
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:37,165
- Damn!

822
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:42,164
- Charlie, hi.

823
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:43,413
- Hi, John.

824
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,589
Lana.

825
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:47,592
(squawking)

826
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,961
- [Jesse] Easy. Easy.

827
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:52,306
Come on.

828
00:48:53,841 --> 00:48:55,433
Come on, give it back.

829
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:57,554
There's nothin' to worry about.

830
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,555
- We heard a noise.

831
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:00,807
- Noise?
(muffled screeching)

832
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:02,066
(clanging)

833
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:02,899
Oh, oh, oh.
(Jesse bickering)

834
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:05,986
The really loud crashing noise.

835
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:06,487
- Yeah.

836
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:07,195
(laughing)

837
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,438
Yeah, pretty much that one, yeah.

838
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:11,116
- Got ya!

839
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,828
(screeching)

840
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:15,120
Give it.

841
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,039
Give it back! It's my skull!
(Charlie stammering)

842
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:17,822
- In there's the kitchen.

843
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:18,532
- Yeah, yeah.

844
00:49:18,532 --> 00:49:20,918
Look, we just wanna
know everything's okay.

845
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:21,835
- Couldn't be better.

846
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,294
- Oh, really? Good, yeah.

847
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,547
- Nice, nice bird.

848
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:28,550
(screeching)

849
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,094
Okay, all right, all right, I know.

850
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,349
(clanging)

851
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:39,811
- Listen, I wanted to tell you
before the evening got away,

852
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,522
you are a funny, funny guy.

853
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:43,231
And I mean that.

854
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,482
That is the hardest commodity

855
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,985
to find in our business, really.

856
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:47,277
Look at this shirt, is this great?

857
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:48,154
Is this him?
- [Lana] Yeah, it's goofy.

858
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:49,488
- You know, bananas, bananas.

859
00:49:49,488 --> 00:49:51,231
(screeching)

860
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:51,947
- [Jesse] Stay!

861
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:54,076
(muffled screeching)

862
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,160
- Where's the beer?

863
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,495
- What are you doin' our here?

864
00:49:56,495 --> 00:49:57,872
Quick, somebody's comin'!

865
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,408
- Yeah, they go all the
way around the back, they do.

866
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:01,118
(grunts)

867
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:02,793
(suspenseful music)

868
00:50:02,793 --> 00:50:04,168
- Ah ha.

869
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,211
- [Jesse] Hi, John.

870
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,006
- Hi, buddy, what'scookin'
in the kitchen?

871
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:09,206
- Nothing.

872
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:09,716
- No?

873
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,926
And what might be in that closet there?

874
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,136
- Nothing.

875
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,003
- Nothing.

876
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,681
Well, can I see?

877
00:50:16,506 --> 00:50:20,893
- John, I just told you,
there's nothing in the closet.

878
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:23,230
- Well, let me see nothing
in the closet.

879
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,024
It wouldn't happen to be

880
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,942
your old friend Rochelle
in there, would it?

881
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,279
- John, what is it you are
accusing me of in my own house?

882
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,575
- I'm not accusing you of anything.

883
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:36,201
I'm just asking a question,

884
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:39,538
but I do think Kate
would like an explanation.

885
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:41,623
- You want an explanation?

886
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:43,709
All right.

887
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:44,960
All right, I'll give you
an explanation.

888
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,837
Kate, Kate, get in here.
- [Kate] What's going on here?

889
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:47,546
- [Jesse] Kate,
I need to talk to you.

890
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:48,588
- Why are you yelling?

891
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,339
- I'm not yelling.

892
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:51,758
Now, Kate, you know
that since we've got here

893
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:54,385
there's been some strange things
going on in this house.

894
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,096
No, I, Charlie!

895
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,391
Char, they want an explanation,
I'm gonna give 'em one.

896
00:50:58,391 --> 00:50:59,766
All right, now listen.

897
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:02,435
All right, now, Charlie and I,
last night,

898
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,896
went to the cemetery and we dug up

899
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:06,022
my great-great-grand father's grave.

900
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:08,316
'Cause we were looking
for a crystal skull.

901
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:09,609
It's supposed to be magic.

902
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:12,320
Anyway, we dug it up
and we got the skull,

903
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,156
but we also found
my great-great-grandfather.

904
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,991
He was dead, but he's alive,

905
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:19,077
I mean he's a mummy
and we brought him back

906
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:21,037
and he's been staying
in the basement.

907
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:23,832
And Charlie and
I've just been running

908
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:25,751
through this jungle trying to
get the skull back.

909
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,418
And that's who's in there

910
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,045
for your information,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

911
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:35,259
(sighs)

912
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,306
- Hi, Rochelle.

913
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,098
What are you doing in here?

914
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:42,142
(slams)

915
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:43,310
There's been a mistake.

916
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,311
- Apparently.

917
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:45,388
- Uh, you don't understand.

918
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:46,354
- I understand perfectly.

919
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,356
- No, Kate, listen to me.

920
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,483
I have no idea
she was doing in there.

921
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,109
- Well, who did you
think was in there?

922
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:52,110
- A mummy!

923
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,279
Or maybe even a baby pterodactyl.

924
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:57,406
(smacks)
Ow.

925
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,158
(grunts)

926
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:01,495
(smacks)

927
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:06,625
- Shame on you, Jesse.

928
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:13,798
- Look, it's a prehistoric bird!

929
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:14,716
(squawks)

930
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:18,303
Kate!

931
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:26,271
(car honking)

932
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:34,862
- Here, let me get those from you.

933
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:35,737
(huffs)

934
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:37,114
- [Charlie] Good riddance.

935
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,406
She's outta here.

936
00:52:39,065 --> 00:52:40,409
Now we can do whatever we want,

937
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,818
run around in our underwear,

938
00:52:42,818 --> 00:52:44,955
phony phone calls,
all kinds of crazy--

939
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,415
- Shut up, Charlie!

940
00:52:46,415 --> 00:52:48,917
Why can't you shut
your mouth just once?

941
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,342
- Surprise!

942
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,302
- Gramps, where's Rochelle?

943
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:01,299
- Watch this.

944
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,019
- Jesse.

945
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,812
- [Jesse] Whoa.

946
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:11,065
- I waited so long for you.

947
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:14,400
- Uh-huh, Rochelle,
it's great to see you,

948
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,027
but I'm having some family
problems right now.

949
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,571
You understand?

950
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:22,868
Charlie, can you call
Rochelle a cab?

951
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:24,786
- Hey, Chucky.

952
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:26,579
- Hey, don't call me Chucky, okay?

953
00:53:29,124 --> 00:53:30,500
- It was very sweet of you to come.

954
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:35,755
Thanks.

955
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:49,602
(softly squawking)

956
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:50,853
Hey there, birdie.

957
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:53,934
How 'bout a little trade, huh?

958
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:55,025
'Kay?

959
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:55,859
(softly squawking)

960
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,277
Come on, give it to Daddy.

961
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:58,027
Come on.

962
00:53:58,445 --> 00:53:59,154
- [Charlie] Whoa!

963
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,906
(squawking)

964
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:11,583
(cries)

965
00:54:12,368 --> 00:54:13,918
I think he wants some more.

966
00:54:14,711 --> 00:54:16,130
- [Charlie]
I don't have any more steak.

967
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:16,880
(grunts)

968
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,090
(laughing)

969
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,091
(barking)

970
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,094
- Now, now, now,
I know that smells good,

971
00:54:22,094 --> 00:54:23,345
I know it smells good.

972
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:26,514
Daddy's gonna have it ready
right away, right away.

973
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:28,058
That's a puppy.

974
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:30,060
Yep, yep, yep, I know.

975
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,521
I know. Daddy knows.

976
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:33,772
Daddy made the nana.

977
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,147
Open your mouth.

978
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,649
There.

979
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,813
(laughing)

980
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:42,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

981
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,365
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

982
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:45,616
Yep, yep.

983
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,484
- Gramps?

984
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:48,745
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

985
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:50,996
You got me a little upset.

986
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,211
- Well, I, I was just hankerin'

987
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:58,830
to play a joke on somebody and...

988
00:55:03,297 --> 00:55:06,054
I'm sorry it turned out to be you.

989
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:08,890
That's enough, Bippy.

990
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,310
Bippy, Bippy, that's enough.
(growling)

991
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,311
Now don't you, Bippy.
(growling)

992
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,105
(growling)

993
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:16,315
(whining)

994
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:19,901
Oh, now look,
just come on out and play.

995
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,155
That's it. There you go.

996
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:26,074
- Um, Gramps, look,
I gotta get to bed.

997
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:29,035
Do you want me to put the skull
back in the fireplace?

998
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,580
- I'll, I'll take care of that.

999
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:35,541
(door creaking)

1000
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:56,103
(mystical music)

1001
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,438
(clinking)

1002
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:02,387
(suspenseful music)

1003
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:08,948
(clinking)

1004
00:56:21,547 --> 00:56:23,167
(gun clacking)

1005
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:30,881
(suspenseful music)

1006
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,475
(shrill barking)(gasps)

1007
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:42,150
(barking)
(sighs)

1008
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,320
(laughing)

1009
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,365
Bippy, you little rascal.

1010
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,200
(laughing)

1011
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,704
You scared the be
jesus out of me.

1012
00:56:53,704 --> 00:56:56,164
(intense music)

1013
00:56:56,164 --> 00:57:00,159
(smacking)

1014
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,295
(groaning)
(barking)

1015
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:06,924
(shouting in foreign language)

1016
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,887
(barking)

1017
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:16,335
(Bippy whining)

1018
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:30,781
(barking)

1019
00:57:38,874 --> 00:57:41,201
(urgent barking)

1020
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:44,337
- Gramps. Gramps.

1021
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:45,712
(barking)

1022
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,051
- Jesse, Jesse boy.

1023
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:50,092
- [Jesse] Are you all right?

1024
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:52,512
- They bushwhacked me.

1025
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:55,973
It musta been 30, 40 of 'em.

1026
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,717
They come at me from all directions.

1027
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:02,146
- Charlie, get up!

1028
00:58:02,814 --> 00:58:04,357
Charlie, come on. Charlie.

1029
00:58:05,311 --> 00:58:06,692
Charlie, wake up!

1030
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:07,896
Get up!

1031
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:11,906
Charlie, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1032
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:14,533
Oh, Jesus, Charlie, come on!

1033
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:18,121
Charlie! Charlie, get up!

1034
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,460
- Jess, this better be real important.

1035
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,044
- Gramps lost the skull.

1036
00:58:25,837 --> 00:58:26,380
- He what?

1037
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,590
- Somebody, I don't know who,
stole it.

1038
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,465
He's dying Charlie.

1039
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,009
We gotta get it back.

1040
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:33,219
- After all we did for him,
he loses it!

1041
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:34,887
I can't believe he did that, Jess!

1042
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,807
I mean, I've never met anyone
so irresponsible!

1043
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:38,634
You know I risked my life--

1044
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:39,720
- Charlie!

1045
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:45,439
(doorbell ringing)

1046
00:58:46,816 --> 00:58:47,608
Yeah?

1047
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:49,402
- Bill, Bill Towner, electrician.

1048
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:50,445
- [Jesse] Uh, Jesse McLaughlin.

1049
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:51,320
- Nice to meet you, Jesse.

1050
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,239
A young lady called, said you
needed some work done.

1051
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,575
- She did, huh? Oh, wait--

1052
00:58:54,575 --> 00:58:56,200
- Where's the fuse box,
down there in the basement?

1053
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,828
- Uh, listen, Bill,
I'm sorry to trouble you,

1054
00:58:58,828 --> 00:59:00,405
but this really isn't the right time.

1055
00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:01,372
- Hey, that's all right, Jess,

1056
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,249
I'm not gonna get in your way.

1057
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:04,125
You just show me what needs fixin'.

1058
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:06,461
This is quite a room you got here.

1059
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:08,453
Yeah, very, very nice.

1060
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,256
That's a weird fireplace though.

1061
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,333
- Yeah, uh, Bill...

1062
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,881
- So what do we got in here?

1063
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:15,261
Ah, there it is.

1064
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,136
Freemon 240, these old houses
are loaded with 'em.

1065
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:22,810
So this the room you're havin'
problem here with, Jess?

1066
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,187
- Uh, yeah, all along this wall,

1067
00:59:25,356 --> 00:59:26,806
but the rest of the house is fine.

1068
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:28,358
(glass shattering)

1069
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:29,608
I wouldn't worry about that, Jesse.

1070
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:30,776
It didn't look too valuable.

1071
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:35,740
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1072
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,199
Just as I'd expected.

1073
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:39,577
Jess, you got a problem here,

1074
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:42,080
but hey, like with any problem,
you know,

1075
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,498
you don't wanna let it
get the best of you.

1076
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:45,542
You know, I've been
workin' on these houses,

1077
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:48,461
oh, about 20 years now
and I've seen enough tragedy

1078
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:51,504
and disaster to make you wanna
up chuck in your shorts.

1079
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:55,293
You see, these old houses,
they just got minds of their own,

1080
00:59:55,293 --> 00:59:58,221
you know, and ya just gotta
teach 'em who's boss.

1081
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:59,514
You know, sorta give 'em a spankin'.

1082
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:00,431
(glass shattering)

1083
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,141
Huh, must be foreign made.

1084
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:06,098
Well, I'm gonna fix this old
house up for you, Jess,

1085
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:08,105
just like it's brand spankin' new.

1086
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:15,821
(buzzing and beeping)

1087
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:21,402
(whirring)

1088
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:24,364
- What is that?

1089
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:25,247
- Shh.

1090
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:29,827
(whirring)

1091
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,380
Uh-huh.

1092
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,341
Oh.

1093
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:39,971
Ooh.

1094
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,061
- What, what do you hear?

1095
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,522
- Ah, Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess.

1096
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:50,306
It's not good.

1097
01:00:50,306 --> 01:00:52,024
I've seen this before and...

1098
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,610
it's always made my adenoids curdle.

1099
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,238
Oh, hey, don't monkey with
those switches, Jess.

1100
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:58,731
It'll blow us both to Milwaukee.

1101
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:02,277
It's touch and go from here, pal.

1102
01:01:02,277 --> 01:01:03,577
Could go either way, Jess.

1103
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:04,995
Oh, yeah, yeah, Jess,

1104
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,331
want to step into my office
here for a second?

1105
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:11,961
Listen, buddy, I like
to be alone with my work,

1106
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,170
so if you don't mind...

1107
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:15,716
- Yeah.

1108
01:01:15,716 --> 01:01:16,590
- You got somethin' to do?

1109
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,509
- Sure.

1110
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:19,009
- Go do it, buddy, go do it.

1111
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:21,096
Go do it.

1112
01:01:21,096 --> 01:01:21,971
(laughing)

1113
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:23,008
Nice kid.

1114
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:29,770
(heroic music)

1115
01:01:35,104 --> 01:01:39,863
(suspenseful music)

1116
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,675
Whoops.

1117
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:05,431
(mischievous music)

1118
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:15,565
Weird.

1119
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:25,702
(suspenseful music)

1120
01:02:25,702 --> 01:02:26,828
- You see anything?

1121
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:30,122
- Forget it.

1122
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:32,459
I'm not goin' up there.

1123
01:02:32,459 --> 01:02:34,167
Gramps can get his own damn skull.

1124
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,879
- Come on, Charlie,
Gramps said they went in here,

1125
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:37,880
so don't wimp out on me now.

1126
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,707
- Hey, buddy.

1127
01:02:38,707 --> 01:02:39,465
(screams)

1128
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,760
Oh, scared ya, huh?

1129
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:43,561
Relax.

1130
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,044
- Oh, God, Bill, are you all right?

1131
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:46,472
- Yeah, fine. Fine, fine.

1132
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:48,057
- Who is this?

1133
01:02:48,674 --> 01:02:49,892
- Uh, Bill.

1134
01:02:50,344 --> 01:02:51,769
- Bill Towner, electrician.

1135
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:55,264
- Charlie Coriell, entrepreneur.

1136
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,316
- Uh, listen, fellas,

1137
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:58,693
we got a little problem
in the other room.

1138
01:02:58,693 --> 01:02:59,985
I think you'd better come have a look.

1139
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,947
- Look, Bill, I'm sorry, but this
really isn't a good time.

1140
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,703
Why don't you pack it
up and come back tomorrow?

1141
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,076
- I think we better go in
the other room and have a look.

1142
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:09,579
(sighs)

1143
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,838
Well, there it is.

1144
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:22,841
Looks like you got some kind
of alternate universe

1145
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:23,927
in there or somethin'.

1146
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,012
(ominous music)

1147
01:03:26,012 --> 01:03:26,804
- Thanks.

1148
01:03:27,676 --> 01:03:28,723
Come on, Charlie.

1149
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,635
- [Charlie] Guess I'm next.

1150
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:34,016
Jess, got any spiders in there?

1151
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:34,604
'Cause you know I--

1152
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:35,729
- You comin', Charlie?

1153
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,609
- [Bill] Hey,
I don't know you guys.

1154
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:40,902
Look, that's an alternate dimension

1155
01:03:40,902 --> 01:03:42,444
in there or somethin' and...

1156
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,821
- [Jesse] Incredible.

1157
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,533
- Well, hold on a second, will ya?

1158
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,652
I've been through
this kinda thing before.

1159
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:52,455
Just don't touch anything
till I get there.

1160
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:54,916
(heroic music)

1161
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:57,669
Looks like you're gonna need
the help of a professional.

1162
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:04,801
(suspenseful music)

1163
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,135
- You got a flashlight?

1164
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:07,011
- Yeah.

1165
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:11,890
(suspenseful music)

1166
01:04:19,691 --> 01:04:20,900
- [Jesse] You know something?

1167
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,860
I'm incredibly scared right now.

1168
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,695
- [Charlie] Don't be a fag, okay?

1169
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,406
- [Jesse] Shh! Listen.
(faint murmuring)

1170
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:29,867
I think it's coming from over there.

1171
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:34,622
(murmuring in foreign language)

1172
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:54,354
(chanting in foreign language)
(woman whimpering)

1173
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:57,228
There it is.

1174
01:04:57,687 --> 01:04:58,353
- [Bill] Yep.

1175
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:01,482
(speaking in foreign language)
(woman whimpering)

1176
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:03,318
Well, it's not gonna be easy.

1177
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:08,118
(speaking in foreign language)
(woman whimpering)

1178
01:05:09,908 --> 01:05:11,784
- They're not gonna
sacrifice her, are they?

1179
01:05:12,035 --> 01:05:14,036
- Hey, Jess, now, now,
is she a virgin?

1180
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,455
Because I've never seen one before

1181
01:05:15,455 --> 01:05:17,331
and she's really dynamite, man.

1182
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:18,124
(snickers)

1183
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:21,168
(shouting in foreign language)

1184
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,169
- Hey!
(shouting in foreign language)

1185
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:23,629
(grumbling)

1186
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:25,498
No, no!

1187
01:05:27,258 --> 01:05:28,050
- [Charlie] Oh, boy.

1188
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:29,468
(speaking in foreign language)

1189
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:32,554
Well, hey, hey,
come on, come on.

1190
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:34,431
Well, I'm sorry, we thought

1191
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,976
that she was somebody
that we knew.

1192
01:05:35,976 --> 01:05:37,977
Go ahead, enjoy, it's okay.

1193
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:39,888
(laughing)

1194
01:05:40,723 --> 01:05:45,599
(shouting in foreign language)

1195
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:48,154
Watch this.

1196
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:53,619
Woohoo!

1197
01:05:53,619 --> 01:05:54,869
(screaming)

1198
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:58,498
(shouting in foreign language)

1199
01:05:58,498 --> 01:06:02,043
(grunting)

1200
01:06:03,837 --> 01:06:07,757
(screaming and shouting)

1201
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:17,808
Whoa! Neat, huh?

1202
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:18,935
(laughing)

1203
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:23,482
(intense music)

1204
01:06:23,482 --> 01:06:28,235
(grunting)

1205
01:06:28,895 --> 01:06:29,821
Hey, you!

1206
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:31,739
(grunting)

1207
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:33,865
Thank you!

1208
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,660
(screaming)

1209
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,536
(clangs)

1210
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:39,497
(clanging)

1211
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,463
Come on, come on.

1212
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,048
- [Jesse]
Get her out of here.

1213
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:54,252
Whoa!

1214
01:06:54,252 --> 01:06:55,178
(groans)

1215
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,057
(shouting in foreign language)

1216
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:00,393
- Jess!

1217
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,981
(choking)

1218
01:07:04,981 --> 01:07:05,773
(groaning)

1219
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:08,568
(screaming)

1220
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:09,443
(sighs)

1221
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:14,282
(shouting in foreign language)

1222
01:07:14,282 --> 01:07:15,025
- [Bill]
Come on, get out of here.

1223
01:07:15,025 --> 01:07:16,033
I'll hold them off.

1224
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:18,370
- Thing is, Billy, I don't
remember which way.

1225
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,778
- Just follow the string.

1226
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,201
- Come on!

1227
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:22,956
- Bill, come on.

1228
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,084
- Don't worry about me.

1229
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:25,001
(barbarian screams)

1230
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:27,544
I gotta get home, my kid's
little league night.

1231
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:29,672
(screaming)

1232
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:30,797
(groaning)

1233
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,799
(clanging)

1234
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,554
(suspenseful music)

1235
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:37,046
- [Jesse] Where's Bill?

1236
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:37,680
I don't see him.

1237
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,464
- [Charlie] Go on!

1238
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:45,397
Hey, Bill. All right!

1239
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:46,522
- Oh, Charlie.

1240
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:47,273
Good to see you back.

1241
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:49,192
I started to get
a little concerned here.

1242
01:07:50,026 --> 01:07:51,860
- Hey, hey, Bill,
what are you doin' here?

1243
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,696
- You know, you guys throw
one heck of a party

1244
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:57,107
and I'd really like to thank you
for inviting me along.

1245
01:07:57,783 --> 01:08:00,202
Jess, it's been a pleasure

1246
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:04,165
and miss,
it was a pleasure to meet you.

1247
01:08:07,202 --> 01:08:09,545
Oh, and Jess, listen, if you
need any more work done

1248
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:11,005
just give me a call there, huh?

1249
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:12,672
Take care, Charlie.

1250
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:14,133
- [Charlie] See ya.

1251
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:17,428
(heroic music)

1252
01:08:17,428 --> 01:08:18,721
Who was that man?

1253
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,223
(sniffs)

1254
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:23,768
(grumbling)

1255
01:08:23,768 --> 01:08:26,603
(squawking)

1256
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,817
- Where the hell's the food?

1257
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,110
- I'll go check.

1258
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,069
(screeching)

1259
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:35,821
- And tell him we're starvin'.

1260
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:37,280
(barking)

1261
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,450
- You know, I've been watchin' her

1262
01:08:40,952 --> 01:08:42,527
and she really likes you.

1263
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,496
Seriously, she likes you.

1264
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:45,872
- Come on, Charlie.

1265
01:08:46,657 --> 01:08:47,583
- I'm serious.

1266
01:08:48,242 --> 01:08:48,959
Watch.

1267
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:54,164
Who do you like better, me or him?

1268
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:58,301
Me, Charlie, fun, you know,
crazy guy, nut,

1269
01:08:59,178 --> 01:08:59,970
or him?

1270
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,468
(whacks)

1271
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:07,770
I rest my case, Jess.

1272
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:08,312
(whacks)

1273
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:09,271
Ow!

1274
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,525
- All right.

1275
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:15,819
Well, if everybody's hungry
let's dig in while it's hot.

1276
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:18,068
- Uh, Jess, shouldn't we say grace?

1277
01:09:18,068 --> 01:09:21,033
You know, say a few nice words
about God or whoever.

1278
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:21,783
- Um...

1279
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:26,619
(serene fiddle music)

1280
01:09:27,623 --> 01:09:31,210
All right, I guess I'd just like to...

1281
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:37,007
thank everyone for their special
contribution to the meal

1282
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:42,345
and to say that I guess
I think of all of you

1283
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,844
as, well, my family now.

1284
01:09:45,844 --> 01:09:47,059
(purring)

1285
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:48,018
(barking)

1286
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,270
- That was well put, son.

1287
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,470
Now, let's eat.

1288
01:09:52,014 --> 01:09:52,940
(squawks)

1289
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,774
- Yeah.

1290
01:09:55,318 --> 01:09:59,197
(growling)
(intense music)

1291
01:09:59,197 --> 01:10:02,658

(intense music)

1294
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:25,346
- Slim...

1295
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,767
you low down weasel.

1296
01:10:30,055 --> 01:10:31,264
I've been waitin' for you.

1297
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,690
- [Slim] Long time, partner.

1298
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,015
(growls)

1299
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:41,321
- [Gramps] Charlie!

1300
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,782
He's mine.

1301
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:50,122
I knew you'd catch up
with me sooner or later.

1302
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:53,793
(growls)
(gunshot fires)

1303
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:54,376
(screaming)

1304
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:55,294
- Gramps!

1305
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:59,702
(suspenseful music)

1306
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,428

1307
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,349
(whimpering)

1308
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:10,550
Gramps.

1309
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:12,394
(shouts)

1310
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,271

1311
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:16,649

(groaning)

1315
01:11:35,793 --> 01:11:37,378
- After all this time...

1316
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:40,338
he got me.

1317
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,260
You're gonna need this.

1318
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:53,477
He's the one that killed
your ma and pa.

1319
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:05,781

1320

(muffled shouting)

1331
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:02,105
Charlie!

(muffled shouting)

1333
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,934

(gunshots firing)
(groans)

1364
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:49,565
(siren blaring)

1365
01:16:58,198 --> 01:16:59,866
- [Voiceover] You and you,
come with me around back.

1366
01:17:02,954 --> 01:17:04,079
- [Voiceover]
A possible sniper holdup

1367
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:05,872
in the 175 Woodacre Drive--

1368
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:06,831
- What's up, Eddy?

1369
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:07,833
- Sheriff, we got a crazy in there

1370
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,209
shootin' up the whole neighborhood.

1371
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:11,086
- The old McLaughlin place.

1372
01:17:11,086 --> 01:17:11,753
- That's right.

1373
01:17:11,753 --> 01:17:12,838
We just found out who owns the place.

1374
01:17:12,838 --> 01:17:13,921
Jesse McLaughlin.

1375
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,132
He's old Clarence's son.

1376
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:16,925
Just moved in a couple of days ago.

1377
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,093
- Clarence's son?

1378
01:17:18,093 --> 01:17:18,844
- Yeah.

1379
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:20,971
- Well, he's movin' out tonight.

1380
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:22,180
I'm gonna talk to that sucker.

1381
01:17:25,343 --> 01:17:26,185
His name was?

1382
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:27,102
- Jesse.

1383
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:28,562
- Jesse!

1384
01:17:29,521 --> 01:17:30,813
We have the place surrounded.

1385
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:33,400
Why don't you come out peacefully

1386
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:34,985
and give yourself up?

1387
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:37,025
We don't want anybody to get hurt.

1388
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:41,491

01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:25,911
(dramatic music)

1396
01:18:28,322 --> 01:18:31,369
- [Slim] Now it's mine!

1397
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:49,600
(blasts)
(groans)

1398
01:18:53,064 --> 01:18:54,105

(gunshot fires)

1400
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,983
- [Voiceover] Get down!

1401
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:58,360
Hold your fire!

1402
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:00,570
- What the hell's goin' on in there?

1403
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:04,690
(groaning)

1404
01:19:07,528 --> 01:19:09,621
(gunshots firing)

1405
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:14,389

1406
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:15,669
(gun clacking)

1407
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:18,462

1408
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:23,251
(dramatic music)

1409
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:32,092
- [Voiceover] Hold your fire!

1410
01:19:35,272 --> 01:19:39,954
(gentle music)

1411
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:57,461
- Did you blow his head off?

1412
01:19:57,461 --> 01:19:59,796
(panting)

1413
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,131
(chuckling)

1414
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:03,008
That's a good boy.

1415
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:05,802
(chuckling)

1416
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:09,422
I thought for sure he's kick your ass.

1417
01:20:09,422 --> 01:20:14,185
(chuckling)

1418
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:16,731
But I didn't let on though,
did I, son?

1419
01:20:16,731 --> 01:20:19,225
- [Jesse] No, no,
you didn't, Gramps.

1420
01:20:19,977 --> 01:20:21,902
(coughing)

1421
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:27,365
- This is it, kid.

1422
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:31,945
(groaning)
- You're not gonna die.

1423
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:34,497
The skull's right here.

1424
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:41,039
- Oh, it don't make
no difference no more, son.

1425
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:46,259
I've done all I can
do in this world...

1426
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:50,672
and it's time to move on.

1427
01:20:51,255 --> 01:20:52,974
- No, no, don't.

1428
01:20:56,928 --> 01:21:00,399
- You get what you want
from this old skull.

1429
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:05,361
I got somethin' real special.

1430
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:11,534
I got to meet
my great-great-grandson

1431
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:14,412
and had a hell of a time.

1432
01:21:17,574 --> 01:21:19,408
You figure what you want...

1433
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:21,837
and then...

1434
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:25,878
get rid of the God damn thing.

1435
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:28,252
- [Jesse] No.

1436
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:31,554
Come on.

1437
01:21:33,849 --> 01:21:35,100
Come on, Gramps.

1438
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:37,810
Hold on.

1439
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:42,523
Hold on, Gramps.

1440
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:46,236
I love you, Gramps.

1441
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:52,576
- I love you too, Jesse.

1442
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:58,740
(bittersweet fiddle music)

1443
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:13,013
- Jesse, this is your last chance.

1444
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:15,473
Come out with your hands up!

1445
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:17,893
I'm gonna count to 10

1446
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,228
and then we're coming in firing.

1447
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:22,355
(suspenseful music)

1448
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:22,927
One...

1449
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:23,940
- [Voiceover] There's
something in the window!

1450
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:24,816
- [Sheriff] Two...

1451
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:26,568
(intense music)

1452
01:22:26,568 --> 01:22:27,318
Three...

1453
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:29,238
Four...

1454
01:22:30,823 --> 01:22:31,531
Five....

1455
01:22:33,442 --> 01:22:34,117
Six...

1456
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:35,942
Seven...

1457
01:22:35,942 --> 01:22:37,280
