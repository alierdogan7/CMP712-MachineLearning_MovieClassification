Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up!

Sarah! Sarah!

5
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,731
- Duncan, what happened to you?

6
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,066
- Good. You're ok.

7
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,201
Go down to the basement.
Right now.

8
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,072
Oh, my God! What is that?

9
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,107
- Do it now! Hurry!

10
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,647
God damn it!

11

13
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,814
- And there she blows.

14
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,350
Mr. and Mrs. hayslip,
take a look.

15
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,123
What is it?

16
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,459
- It's definitely something
the doctor should look at.

17
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,494
He'll be with you in a moment.

18
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,362
- Thank you.

19
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,764
- Thanks.

20
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,339
Uh-huh, uh huh.

21
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,308
Familial adenomatous polypsis.

22
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,777
- It's a polyp.

23
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,247
- Oh, it sounds really bad.
That sounds bad.

24
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,316
- You got a thing in your butt.

25
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,450
- Ok.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,385
You need a little trooper
in your pooper.

27
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,386
You don't need 'em there.

28
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,588
- Is it serious?

29
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,657
- It's, it's not that bad.
It's not that serious.

30
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,693
This though,
this is a weird shape.

31
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:51,330
This is concerning me a little,
but not overly.

32
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,431
Look, in the end,

33
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,933
this lump in your colon

34
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:59,271
is most likely due to psm
which is poor stress management.

35
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,406
Look, how long have you had
stomach issues?

36
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,509
- Um, for...Ever.

37
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,911
- Yeah. He's in
the bathroom a lot.

38
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,180
Not, I mean not, not a lot.

39
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,382
I'm in the bathroom
a decent amount of time,

40
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,416
but not like, it's not extreme.

41
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,653
- Hour. Hour and a half.
- Yeah. About 90 minutes.

42
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:19,691
- That's not, that's...
Hugely concerning.

43
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,593
- Over the course of the day.
Not...

44
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,895
- Ok. Good thing is,
we can do something about this.

45
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,898
It's an endoscopic polypectomy.

46
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,667
Basically, we insert a camera,

47
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,202
into the anus.

48
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,470
- Ok.
- Right?

49
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,939
There's an electrified
wire loop at the end of it,

50
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,874
and we (Makes popping noise)
Pop it off.

51
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,676
Like a plum off a tree.

52
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:41,213
Being pulled by an electrified
wire loop.

53
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,781
- Ok. Ok, you don't have to,

54
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,250
you don't have to describe it
anymore.

55
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,986
- Do you have a family history
of g.I. Problems?

56
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,355
- Uh, well, you know, my mom
would gladly tell you

57
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,991
that she's um, you know,
regular like clockwork.

58
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,494
- One of those.
What about your father?

59
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,529
- Uh, well, we don't speak.

60
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,465
I haven't spoken to him
in sometime. So...

61
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,867
Look, I think what you're going
to need

62
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,402
is some coping mechanisms,

63
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,671
so I can give you the name
of some professionals

64
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,872
that can help you out.

65
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,473
- Are you talking about
a therapist?

66
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,475
Oh, I'm not,
I'm not a therapy guy.

67
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,677
- We can get there.
We'll do it.

68
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,912
- Great. Stop by the desk
on your way out.

69
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,014
Talk to Nancy about scheduling
a follow-up.

70
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,950
Until then, you take it down.

71
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,485
No stress. Keep it quiet.

72
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,586
- Right.

73
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,988
- No stress.

74
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,728
(Whispering) Keep it cool.

75
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,664
No stress.

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,634
[Elevator rings]

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,773
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,493
Um, hello?

79
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,695
This is my office. You might be
in the wrong office.

80
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,966
- Hey, guys. Just take that all
down the hall and to the left.

81
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:13,071
Lucky day, dunc. New office.
Part of the new job. What?

82
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,072
- New job?

83
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,474
- Human resources.

84
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,708
- I'm an accountant.

85
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,643
I don't know the first thing
about humans.

86
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,579
- It's just temporary.

87
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,780
You're far too valuable
an accountant

88
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,382
to keep you in h.R.
Permanently.

89
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,584
- I'd love to help.
I just don't know

90
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,451
if I'm the right man
for the job.

91
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,319
- Do you believe
in this company?

92
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,020
- Yes.

93
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,322
- Do you believe in our
mission statement?

94
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:34,593
- Our clients trust us because
we put our own skin in the game.

95
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,361
- I'm in the game.
- I'm in the game, too.

96
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,029
- Yeah, your retirement
account is here. Mine is here.

97
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,331
We're in this together.

98
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,565
- Right. Right. Right.

99
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,768
Which is why I need you
to handle the layoffs.

100
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,103
- What?

101
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,805
- You're a nice guy, dunc.
- Thank you.

102
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,074
Which is exactly what we need
right now.

103
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,377
A nice guy, and we gotta
let some people go.

104
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,112
And you just said
you're a team player.

105
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,082
- I am a team player, it's just
that I don't...

106
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,353
I don't-- I've never fired
anybody before in my life.

107
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,387
- It's easy. You'll love it.

108
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,889
I'm so glad you're on board.

109
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,725
Um, I'd be sad to see you go.

110
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,126
- What?

111
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,495
- So. Your new office.

112
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,534
- This is the bathroom?

113
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,370
- It was a bathroom, and now
it is an office. For two.

114
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,771
Hey, there, cubie.

115
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,907
That's what I'm saying
instead of roomie.

116
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,608
- Dunc, you know alistair.

117
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,710
- Um...Yeah.

118
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,914
- Uh, Duncan, I need you and Al
to work on a re-org chart

119
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,918
and uh, I'm going to need to
see that first thing next week.

120
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,620
- Next week? I still have to
deal with the Darcy accounts,

121
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,857
I have the board of directors
asked me to make a presentation.

122
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,158
I have to get that done
by Monday.

123
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,127
- You got alistair.
Between the two of you,

124
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,129
- you got it covered.
- Hey, uh, cubie.

125
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,431
You think these toilets
are still functional?

126
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,633
Would save us a lot of trips
down the hall.

127
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,405
Really?

128
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,806
-Yeah.

Lactose intolerant.
Just like myself.

140
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,971
- I am not--did I, did I write
that I was?

141
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,472
- You checked it yes.

142
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,041
I meant no, I'm not.

143
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,010
- I don't get it, you meant no
when you said yes?

144
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,678
- I think it was just
a mistake.

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,213
I am not lactose intolerant.

146
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,515
Ok, don't make it
a big issue.

147
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,218
- I'm sorry. What's happening?

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,187
- Witch doctor. Witch doctor.

149
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,088
- Shut up!!

150
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,557
Don't listen to him.

151
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,193
He thinks he knows everything
about everybody.

152
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,562
I can't stand him sometimes.

153
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,698
It's like--ugh. [Laughs]

154
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,036
All right then.
Let's get started.

155
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,210
I want you to come over here.

156
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,612
Lay down. Relax.

157
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,814
- Uh, what, what for?

158
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:10,949
- What you came here for.

159
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,552
Hypnosis. Not?

160
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,588
Oh...No.

161
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,223
- I want to bypass
your conscious mind

162
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,825
to access
your sub conscious mind.

163
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:21,893
- Ah...

164
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,496
- Where the real you might be.

165
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,165
The true you.

166
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,969
A light and consistent stroke

167
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,938
over the forehead...

168
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,674
From temple to temple...

169
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:39,277
Relaxes the patient.

170
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,679
Ok.

171
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,651
No, I act--I actually don't know
if this is right for me.

172
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,219
I mean, I'm only here
because of my wife.

173
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,822
Uh, no offense, I'm just not,

174
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,591
I just don't believe
in hypnosis.

175
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,825
How about we do this,

176
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,827
how about we just pretend,
I'll pay you,

177
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,563
and we'll pretend
that I'm making progress.

178
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,098
- I don't need your money.

179
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,534
I didn't mean to offend you.

180
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,536
- I'm not offended.

181
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,205
I'm just sad.

182
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:12,611
Uh, I'm here on earth
to help people.

183
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,312
- (Sighs) Well, thank you
for coming.

184
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,286
Would you mind if I uh...
If I took off?

185
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,755
-Shh.

186
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,759
[Bird squawks]

187
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,795
We're done.

188
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,568
I just want to thank you two

189
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,269
for being so supportive.

190
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,672
It's kind of been a rough time.
A lot of stress at work.

191
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,074
- It has been, it's been a crazy
couple of weeks at work.

192
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,910
- Well, we love seeing you guys.

193
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,146
And Bobby just, you know,
he loves to cook.

194
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,583
-Oh, I do. I do.

195
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,119
- Oh, mom, don't. Mom...

196
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,026
Mom: Mm, oh, oh...

197
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,133
Oh...That is not the spiciest
dish at the table.

198
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,934
[Duncan laughs] Yeah.

199
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,604
Well, thank you so much
for the food, Bobby.

200
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,005
- Duncan?
- Yeah?

201
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,607
- You can call me dad.
Or daddy.

202
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,175
- No. I don't need to.
- Papa.

203
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,377
- Bobby is good with me.

204
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,979
- You know what?
Don't call me daddy.

205
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,615
That's reserved
for somebody else.

206

[Doorbell rings]

207

[Stomach growls]

208
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,687
That must be our special guest.

209
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,021
- Special guest?

210
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,723
- (Whispering) I don't know
what she's talking about.

211
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,958
- Dunkie. I kind of imagine
what it must be like for you.

212
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,094
Growing up without a male
to look up to.

213
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,962
To know what males
should act like.

214
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,198
Every now and then
it's a little obvious.

215
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,866
- Mom: Everybody.

216
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,001
- Sort of...Girlie.

217
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,036
- This is Dr. Lawrence tip,

218
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,772
and he runs the tip center
for fertility.

219
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,108
- That's right. And we're doing
really well.

220
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,645
Duncan, I presume?

221
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,814
- Yeah. Yes.

222
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,249
- I've heard a lot about you.

223
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,318
Are--are you two planning
on having a baby?

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,087
- (Chuckles) Oh, heavens no.

225
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,254
- Not the way we do it.

226
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,056
(Duncan sighs)

227
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,360
- So Duncan,
your mother here tells me

228
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,297
that you guys are having
a little trouble conceiving.

229
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,865
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- No.

230
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,167
- Sweetie, Sarah is ready.

231
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,737
So if your little guys
are slow swimmers,

232
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,872
maybe something can be done.

233
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,309
- Wow. Beatrice, I feel like
I may have mislead you

234
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,778
because that is not
an issue that we're having.

235
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,981
- Duncan, if you have a problem
with erectile dysfunction,

236
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,349
I can help you with that.

237
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,384
- Look, I just thought there
might be a problem

238
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,087
your father had a problem
in that department.

239
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,956
- I just thought...
- I don't, I don't...

240
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,324
Need to know about any of that.

241
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,692
- Honey, sometimes we have to
hear things

242
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,694
we don't want to hear.

243
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,095
- It's a common affliction,
Duncan.

244
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,463
A lot of men have it.

245
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,133
[Chuckles] Not me, of course.
I'm a very virile man.

246
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,368
- Me neither. Very super virile.

247
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,903
- I don't know you well enough

248
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,705
for this to feel comfortable
with me.

249
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,875
- Bobby, thank you so much
for this delicious food.

250
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,310
- If you want, Duncan, I can
set up an examination.

251
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,745
- I don't.

252
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,180
- Would you?

253
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:07,018
- In fact, maybe I can take
a look tonight while I'm here.

254
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,720
- That would be perfect!

255
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,189
- See if there's a response
to a stimulus.

256
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,423
- Are you the one
doing the stimulating?

257
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,992
- That's correct, yes.

258
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,127
And size has nothing
to do with it.

259
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,729
Don't be bashful.

260
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,131
- He's right. You know, I mean,
we don't have that problem.

261
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,167
- No.
- We have the opposite problem.

262
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,836
- I mean, we have to
really take it slow.

263
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,505
- Honey, no one cares about
the size of your Willie.

264
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,008
I've seen it, it's beautiful.
It's way above average.

265
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,177
The point is progeny.

266
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,312
We want grandkids.

267
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,214
- In other words,
there's more than one way

268
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,749
to choke a chicken.

269
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,251
- Uh, wow, that's...

270
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,353
That's something to think about.

Oh, look at that. It's work.
I'm gonna have to take this.

the toilets
do not work properly.

I've looked into the Murphy
report on your computer,

278
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,774
- you're using my computer?

279
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,343
- Yes, and the good news is,
I found it.

280
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,511
The bad news is,

281
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,280
I think I may have deleted
something important.

- You what?

283
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,318

presentation."

- Honestly, I was flustered
by the toilet situation.

00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,868
I called the janitor.
That's going to be better.

That will--

Did you know that the leading
cause of divorce is children?

- That's not true.

That is just what children

right now.

I wanted to have a kid today.

I don't need to have a kid
tomorrow.

I have plans.

I gotta go see the doctor.
I gotta get the car washed.

Honestly, so if you're planning
on popping out a kid,

(Chuckles) What am I gonna say?

322
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,103

is just say no.

[Chuckles] It's just,
it's not a great time

there was a beautiful time

to hurt him in here.

You see, that fear, worry
and anger

588
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,273
are essential
to the human beings

589

as long as we can control them.
And use them to our advantage.

This is the furthest thing
from a metaphor!

Listen! If you kill it,

598
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,433
it would be just like giving
yourself a lobotomy.

to control it.

the most important thing now,

- Yeah. And humiliating.

one thing now.

Milo comes.

718

- Duncan.
- Oh, good morning.

741
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,629
- Any idea why Eric Paulson

742
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:35,832
would've made 6 frantic phone
calls before 9am?

743
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,033
- What?

744
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,535
- He wants to know why his
account has been zeroed out.

745
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,970
- Wait, back up.
Who did what to who and what?

746

- Zero. Gone.

747
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,175
- What?
- Yeah.

What? Huh...

All right. Slow down.
What happened?

750

- I don't know. I don't know.

751
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,803
and it looks like his holdings
have been sold,

752
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:17,006
and then everything was just
dumped into tectonic pipeline.

753

- Tectonic is junk.
- No, I know.

754

I haven't spoken to him
in two weeks.

755

I mean everything was fine
a few days ago.

756

- Duncan, this is your account.
It's your responsibility.

- I know. Of course. Of course.
I know. I-I--

- ok. Hold on. Just, hold on.

- Ok.

761

our employee pension fund.

And cover the Paulson losses.

- What?

764
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:56,679
- We gotta borrow from Peter
to pay Paulson.

00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,520
Like the fact that you haven't
remembered my birthday

879
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,988
since I was 10.

880
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,490
- Or the fact that you don't
even remember my wife's name.

881
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:42,992
Do you remember my wife's name?

882
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,394
- Grace.
- No.

883
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,964
- Do you even think about me?

884
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,335
Do you wonder if I'm ok?

885
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,404
- I don't know. You seem ok.

886
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:58,441
I mean nobody's stabbing you in
the eye with a fork right now.

887
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,109
Not that I can see.

888
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,244
- Yeah, well, shit's fucked up
right now, dad.

889
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:04,947
- Shit is as fucked up
as you allow it to be.

890
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,350
Namaste.

891
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,888
[Duncan's stomach growls]

892
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,889
Oh, that's very sound advice.

893
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:14,924
Great. No, I'll take that

894
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:17,260
from my pretentious, loser,
pot head dad

895
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,328
who doesn't give a shit about
anybody but himself.

896
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,863
- I take this as prescribed.

897
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:22,932
- Yeah, why don't you go
medicate some more.

898
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,867
[Duncan groaning]

899
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,936
Just hold that thought.
Hold that thought.

900
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:32,975
[Duncan screams]

901
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,610
Ok. I'm letting you out,
I'm letting you out.

902
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:35,912
I'm letting you out,
but we're gonna talk.

903
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:39,615
We're gonna talk, ok?
[Duncan screams]

904
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,018
You're all right.
You're all right.

905
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,386
[Milo muttering]

906
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,357
Oh, shit. Oh, shh shh shh
shh shh shh.

907
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,458
Come on. I let you out.
I let you out.

908
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,595
So let's,
let's talk about this ok?

909
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,598
I don't want you to kill my dad.
I don't want that.

910
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,067
No, no, no, no, no.

911
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,105
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it!

912
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,408
No! Don't! Bad! Bad!

913
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,044
Shit! Get off me!

914
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,052
Get off! Get off!

915
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,122
Stop it! I know!
I know he's a dick.

916
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,092
I know, I know. He's wrong.

917
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,995
But please, don't...
Eat my father.

918
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,530
No matter how I'm feeling.

919
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:28,965
[Milo growls]

920
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,368
Are you hungry? Huh?
Are you hungry?

921
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,303
I don't have anything here.

922
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,672
But I have something
at the office.

923
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,008
I have a lot of food
at the office.

924
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,243
So why don't you crawl...
Crawl back inside me.

925
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:42,979
Crawl back inside.

926
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:44,914
[Duncan whimpers]

927
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,015
[Milo muttering]

928
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:47,516
Good boy. Good Milo.

929
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,118
[Duncan whimpers]

930
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,529
Wow.

931
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:01,964
Stomach flu?

932
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,370
Well, I hope you're not relying
on Western medicine to cure you.

933
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:08,971
- Listen, dad.

934
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:12,408
I'm sort of doing this...
Therapy thing.

935
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,044
And I'm seeing this guy,
and it's actually been helping.

936
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,713
And could, would you just
listen to me for a second?

937
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:20,349
I think that maybe if you and I
went in,

938
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,650
and we talked to him together,

939
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:24,553
that maybe we can
deal with this.

940
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,956
- I can't. I'm sorry, Duncan.

941
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:30,459
Just I can't, I...Can't.

942
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,196
- You can't.
- Yeah.

943
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,600
I can't tell you anything else.
That's, that's the size of it.

944
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,038
Yeah. Ok.

945
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,439
Maybe I expected too much.

946
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,808
- Yeah. I guess you did.

947
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,196
Woman: What's that smell?

948
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,413
[Elevator rings]

949
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,286
Oh, oh, oh, oh, food.

950
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:32,621
Food it's coming, just, aah!

951
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,226
Food, food.

952
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,231
Oh, fuck...

953
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:58,547
Yeah. I'm sorry...About this.

954
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,156
Here it is. A little mousey.

955
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:11,127
[Smacks lips] Come on.
It's good eats.

956
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,394
It's a good source of protein.

957
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:13,562
Come on, Milo. Just grab it.

958
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,264
- Duncan, you better
get out here.

959
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,201
What are you doing?

960
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,202
- Nothing.

961
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:22,071
- Look at you. You're a mess.

962
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:23,372
What happened to you?

963
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:25,274
- [Chuckles] Oh...

964
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:26,542
- Is that poop on your shirt?

965
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:28,711
- It's a stomach flu.

966
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:31,147
- Uh-huh. Well, there's
federal agents out here.

967
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,281
It's looking pretty serious.

968
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:33,382
- What's that?

969
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:36,619
- We got federal agents.
Come on.

970
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:37,853
- All right, yeah.
I'll be right behind you.

971
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,088
I'm coming out.

972
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,356
- Button your pants.

[Milo growling and chewing]

974
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:49,632
Do not shut down your computer.
Do not touch anything.

975
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,601
These documents are now the
property of the U.S. government.

976
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,703
Ma'am, please step away
from your desk.

977
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,541
Sir, do not turn off
your computers.

978
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:00,342
Step away from your desk please.

979
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:05,347
- What's going on?
- I don't know what's going on.

980
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,815
Where's Phil?

981
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,317
Agent: Please step away
from your desk, sir.

982
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,556
Phil, Phil, Phil!

983
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,124
What the hell's going on
out there?

984
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:19,361
Uh, that uh, government seizure
of institutional assets,

985
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,497
freezing of accounts.
That sort of thing.

986
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,732
- No, no, no. I can see that.

987
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,734
Why?

988
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:28,204
Shit Duncan, don't worry about
it. It doesn't concern you.

989
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,206
- No, no. What about
our investments?

990
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:33,275
Our employee investments.
Our retirement accounts.

991
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,211
- God, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

992
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,278
but I think those accounts

993
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,514
are probably all zeroed out
by now.

994
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,652
It sucks. I know.

995
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:44,887
- You were talking about
upper management.

996
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:48,157
You were talking
all that stuff about

997
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,558
employees being our clients,
that's what,

998
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,759
you were saying those things.
- Gee.

999
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:53,429
- What about your money?
What about your money?

1000
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,564
- Come on, d. You don't think
I was stupid enough

1001
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,932
to invest here. Fuck no.

1002
00:53:56,934 --> 00:54:00,169
I'm good. You, you got no
poker face.

1003
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,403
You're a pussy.

1004
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,306
In this world of ours,
pussies don't excel.

1005
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:06,242
If you want to survive,

1006
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,776
you gotta take a dump
on your enemies.

1007
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:12,448
Or else, you're the one eating
the shit sandwich.

1008
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,484
Now if you will please
remove your hand.

1009
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,592
Hey, Phil.

and Duncan groans]

What the fuck is that?

1012

- Fuck you, Phil.

<i>Operator: 911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

1015
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:23,686
- H-h-hello. I'd like to
report a...

1016
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:25,788
Another raccoon attack.

1017

Sarah: Duncan?

1018
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:40,336
Are you ok? What happened?

1019
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:44,273
- Oh, my God, Sarah. Oh, my God.
The FBI, uh...

1020
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,674
- What do you mean the FBI?

1021
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,376
What are--what's going on?

1022
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:51,880
- These guys came.
These FBI guys came into...

1023
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,383
The uh, office,
and they said everything

1024
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:55,751
was the property
of the government's.

1025
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:59,521
- Phil said that all our
accounts are gone.

1026
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,390
- What do you mean
all the accounts are gone?

1027
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:02,791
- Everything. He stole
everything.

1028
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,926
He stole everything.

1029
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:04,860
- We have no savings.
- Oh, my God.

It's all gone [Screams]

- Oh, my God, Duncan.
- I know.

00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,668
I know. I know.

1034

I'm pregnant.

1038
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:27,916
Since when?

1039
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:29,985
- Just, I just found out.

1040
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,454
I was feeling,
I was feeling weird,

1041
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:35,657
and I missed my period,
so I, I took a test.

1042
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:39,328
Why, why didn't you,
why didn't you tell me this?

1043
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,563
- I just told you. I just--

1044
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,831
why didn't you tell me before?

1045
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,734
- I just found out, Duncan.
I just took the test.

1046
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,836
- No. We said we were going
to wait.

1047
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,639
We said we were gonna wait.
Did you plan this?

1048
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:53,075
I mean, did you do this on,
did you do this on purpose?

1049
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,710

Um, but first, who would like
a drink?

1396
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:28,649
- Do you have any weed?

1397
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,051
- Ok, be right back.

1398
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,988
- Do I really have to put it
back inside you?

1399
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:37,258
- Yeah. He's...

1400
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,225
He's part of me.

1401
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:41,028
- He's not gonna try
and hurt you?

1402
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:42,830
- No.

1403
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,966
He's all right now.

1404
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:46,200
Ok.

1405
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,250
Ok.

1406
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:07,054
- How is this gonna work?
I mean how, how is he gonna fit?

1407
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,523
Oh, it'll, it'll work,
trust me.

1410
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:20,067
Are you like turning him?

1411
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:22,937
- I, he's kind of turning
on his own.

1412
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:27,742
Ok. It's his thing. It's just...
He's probably mad.

1413
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:30,277
- I just gotta get him that last
half inch.

1414
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:31,245
- Ok.

But now every day.
Saturday, Monday.

1525
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,030
Not Sunday.
That's the lord's day.

1526
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:25,265
I'm joking.
Full thrust Sundays.

1527
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,534
And now it's not a problem,
I mean...

1528

Now you can hang up posters
in there.

or meat. Organic.

- Yeah. You can
put a cork there.

1535
01:23:46,222 --> 01:23:47,287
A big one.

1536
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:49,123
- It's gonna have to be
a pretty big cork.

1537
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:53,694
- Yeah. Ok. Session's over.
Got a new patient coming in.

1538

- Ah, great.

1539
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:57,264
How you gonna explain
all of this?

1540
01:23:57,266 --> 01:23:59,433
- Oh, uh, they've seen it all.

1541
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:01,301
- Really not my problem,
I guess.
