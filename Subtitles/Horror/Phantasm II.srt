00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,487
[Thinking]
Eight years ago,

2
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,490
my visions began...

3
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,661
terrifying fantasies
of things to come.

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,291
Through them I found you, Mike,

5
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,500
and your friend, Reggie.

6
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,836
[Male]
First, he took Mom and Dad.

7
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,547
Then he took Jodie.

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Now he's after me.

9
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:37,388
Mike, that Tall Man of yours
did not take Jodie away.

10
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,015
Jodie died in a car wreck.

11
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,060
He had a dream...

12
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,936
just a nightmare.

13
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,273
Seems so real.

14
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,612
You know, partner, what we need
is a change a scenery.

15
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,531
Where'll we go?

16
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,825
Well, I don't know.

17
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,411
I guess we can figure
that one out when we get there.

18
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,584
Okay.

19
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,961
Well, get on upstairs,
get your gear together.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,465
'Cause we leave
when the sun comes up.

21
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,970
[Thinking]
But I also found him.

22
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,142
The Tall Man.

23
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,990
[Gasps]

24
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,492
Boy!

25
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,287
[Yells]

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,709
[Glass shattering]

27
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,564
[Clicks]

28
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,539
[Roaring]

29
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,773
[Shrieking]
Ow! Ow! Ow!

30
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,128
[Whispers]
Shit.

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,760
[Growls]

32
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,456
[Whispers]
Burn, you son of a bitch.

33
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,806
Shit!

34
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,274
[Yelling]

35
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,378
Stay down, it's okay.

36
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,180
[Clunk]

37
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,351
[Female] I don't know
where he comes from...

38
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,354
maybe another dimension.

39
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,400
His army of creatures.

40
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,569
He destroys towns

41
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,239
and plunders their graveyards
to enslave the dead.

42
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,826
Each day, I can feel him
coming closer.

43
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,745
He knows I see him.

44
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,958
We've both seen what he can do.

45
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,052
Mike, we've grown up together.

46
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,140
I know you're out there.

47
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,018
Soon, my grandfather will die.

48
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,813
And my visions will become real.

49
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,656
I need you.

50
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,159
Mike, help me.

51
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,542
[Male groaning]

52
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,343
[Male] Well,
I guess you could say I just

53
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,721
really went over the deep end.

54
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,723
I mean, I got to the point
where I couldn't distinguish

55
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,141
fantasy from reality.

56
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,018
[Male voice]
That's good, keep it up.

57
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,146
And I don't blame Redge anymore.

58
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,106
I mean... what could he do?

59
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,858
I mean, the dreams were really
just taking hold of me.

60
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,610
[Male voice] Just tell him
what he wants to hear.

61
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,280
And besides,
since... I lost my family,

62
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,325
Redge is really the only...
person I've got.

63
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,702
- He's the only one that stood by me.
- I gotta get outta here.

64
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,037
She needs me.

65
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,079
And now that I'm not having
these dreams,

66
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
I'm really looking forward

67
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,458
to just moving back in with him
and getting on with my life.

68
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,584
There are a lot of things
I want to do.

69
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,213
It's been a tough seven years.

70
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,175
But you've come a long way.

71
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,471
Be well, Michael.

72
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,391
And remember...
it was all in your imagination.

73
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,231
The fuck it was.

74
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,163
[Clunk]

75
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,049
[Clunk]
Uh!

76
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,890
I was afraid I'd find ya here.

77
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,228
Come on, Mike.

78
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,771
Get up outta there.

79
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,274
This whole place is empty.

80
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,694
So, uh, come on,
lets' go home.

81
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,404
Look at this,
God damn it!

82
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,533
Now, that's the third one
I dug up!

83
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,662
Now, does it strike you
a little strange, Redge,

84
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,707
that every single corpse
in this entire graveyard's missing?

85
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,459
Well, what do you want, Mike?

86
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,173
I wanna stop him.

87
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,258
The Tall Man?

88
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,095
That story about me
blowing up my own house

89
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,764
because it was infested
with midgets.

90
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,726
Mike, that wasn't real.

91
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,563
Your doctor said it was
your own paranoid delusion.

92
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,357
Hey, fuck the doctors and fuck you too,
if you don't want to help me!

93
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,234
God damn it, Mike,
I've tried to help ya!

94
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,694
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

95
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,781
He showed me things.

96
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,119
I think he wants me
to come to him.

97
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,579
Why you?

98
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,205
I'm not the only one,
there's others.

99
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,583
There's a girl.

100
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,877
She's drawn to him too.

101
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,006
But I'm telling you, man,
without our help, she's gonna die.

102
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,092
He's gotta be stopped
and I'm going after him.

103
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,218
I know I can find him.

104
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,765
But to kill him

105
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,351
I'm gonna need your help.

106
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,979
[Whispering]
Shit, Mike.

107
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,607
If they catch you here
diggin' up graves,

108
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,692
they'll put you away
and you'll never get out again.

109
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,902
Come on back to the house.

110
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,862
Come on, man,
we can talk it out there.

111
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,744
[Redge]
Dinner's waitin' for ya.

112
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,498
Aunt Martha came down
and Celeste baked a turkey.

113
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,668
And you know, little Bonnie,

114
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,504
she just can't wait
to meet her Uncle Mike.

115
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,381
God, she's been talkin'
about it all day.

116
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,052
Man, she's really,
really high on seein' ya.

117
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,847
[Male voice]
Welcome home, boy.

118
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,767
Redge, we gotta get the people
outta your house, man!

119
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,852
The gas in there's gonna go off
and it's gonna blow!

120
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,062
Ah!

121
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,032
No, no, no!

122
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,075
Redge!

123
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,119
Get 'em out.
Gotta get 'em out!

124
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,162
Come on,
we gotta get 'em out!

125
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,164
No, no, no!

126
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,294
You couldn't save 'em.

127
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,667
You knew.

128
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,086
Before it happened.

129
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,672
I'm so sorry, Redge.

130
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,302
[Sighs]

131
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,220
Let's go, Mike.

132
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,389
We got things to do.

133
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,858
[Redge] Mike didn't need
to ask me anymore.

134
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,903
I enlisted for the duration.

135
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,155
[Engine whirs]

136
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,996
He told me it might take us years
to find the Tall Man.

137
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,499
And if we did,
we'd probably die.

138
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,002
Yeah, maybe.

139
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,046
But not without a fight.

140
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,994
Lets' go shopping.

141
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,742
Redge, long guns are no good.

142
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,954
Let's go to work.

143
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,208
This guy worked
at close range.

144
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,016
There's no use tryin'
to tell anybody.

145
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,770
They'd lock us up
and throw away the key.

146
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,234
We'd spent a long time
on the road.

147
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,860
Northwest mostly.

148
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,071
It wasn't hard
to pick up his trail.

149
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,741
Places he'd been
always look the same.

150
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,999
Small towns are like people.

151
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,710
Some get old
and die a natural death.

152
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,381
Some are murdered.

153
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,774
[Heavy breath]

154
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,610
[Mike]
We have to be careful.

155
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,781
'Cause sometimes
he sets traps for us.

156
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,333
Too damn late.

157
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,230
Let's get the tools
and scope it out.

158
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,311
[Chainsaw revs]

159
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,637
[Whispers]
I'll check it out.

160
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,930
All right, I'll go this way.

161
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay.

162
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,850
[Splashing]

163
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,701
[Knocking]

164
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:18,188
Mike!

165
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,448
Down here, Mike.

166
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,078
[Whispering]
Hey, Mike, he left one.

167
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,313
Who are you?

168
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,832
[Whimpering]

169
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,335
[Whispering]
Where do we find him?

170
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,764
Oh, my God.

171
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,977
Liz, what has he done to you?

172
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,855
[Whines]

173
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,232
Redge,

174
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,276
this is the one
I was telling you about...

175
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,944
the... the girl in my...

176
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,405
well...

177
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,951
[crackling]

178
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,336
Ohh, you play
a good game, boy.

179
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,756
Come east, if you dare.

180
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,175
Get the fuck back!

181
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,927
[Groaning]

182
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,354
[Redge]
It wasn't the first time

183
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,191
the Tall Man had left
one of his calling cards.

184
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:30,111
But that one was
the worst, so far.

185
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,032
He must know we're on his trail
because that hunchback apparition

186
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,784
looked just like the girl
in Mike's head.

187
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,204
We're moving east

188
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,122
toward the state line.

189
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,084
There's one more town...
Perigord.

190
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,131
[Female] I buried my grandchild
and both of my children.

191
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,509
Now my husband.

192
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,929
It's so hard to live past
the ones you love.

193
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,972
Hey, Grandma,

194
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,974
you still got me and Jeri, okay?

195
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,563
I don't see much of Jeri,
but how are you?

196
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,857
Are you still having
those nightmares?

197
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,484
Um, no.

198
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,110
No, not any more.

199
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,446
Oh, I can't.

200
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,949
You've gotta be strong, Grandma.

201
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,159
You know Grandpa
would have wanted it that way.

202
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,579
I'll try.

203
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,518
In the name
of the Father and the Son

204
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,812
and the Holy Spirit.

205
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,273
Amen.

206
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,051
I know how hard it is for you.

207
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,510
But remember,

208
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,513
he's left a life of pain
and trouble.

209
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,973
And he's gone to God.

210
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,684
He's going to rest now.

211
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,728
The last train leaves at six.

212
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,313
I've gotta be on it.

213
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,315
Damn it, Jeri,
I need you to be here.

214
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,400
With us.

215
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,110
Just one more day.

216
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,112
I have to get back
to Bruce and Stevie.

217
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,323
I've gotta get going now.

218
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,824
It's 20 miles back
to the station.

219
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,453
[Whispering] Besides,
Grandma's a tough cookie.

220
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,621
Thanks, Jeri.

221
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,831
I'm sorry, hon,
I really do have to go.

222
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,502
Look, if there's
any problem, just call.

223
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,296
Okay?

224
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,506
Take care.

225
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,155
Jeri?

226
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:24,679
[Rustling]

227
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,317
[Thinking]
Damn!

228
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,362
It's not a dream.

229
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,451
Mike.

230
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,911
Where are you?

231
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,164
Redge,

232
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,624
she's in danger.

233
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,334
Who?

234
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,794
The other, the girl.

235
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,755
Well, you said that
six months ago.

236
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,090
Yeah, well,
this time I'm certain.

237
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,469
We're close to her
and the Tall Man.

238
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,721
Come on, let's go.

239
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,436
Geez, I slept half
the day away.

240
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,356
I don't know, man, you say she's here,
you say she's there.

241
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,816
She's everywhere.

242
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,986
So, maybe so.

243
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,864
But I'm still not so sure
she's not just a wet dream.

244
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,950
Listen, Redge,

245
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,535
we're close.

246
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,120
And soon,
I'm gonna find her.

247
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,372
And him.

248
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,708
All right then.

249
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,296
[Car starts]

00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,466
[Tires squeal]

251
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,554
My darling,
I love you so much.

252
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,848
[Sobs]

253
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,938
I'll miss you,
I'll miss you.

254
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,363
Forgive me, Lord,

255
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,701
but I must end the sacrilege.

256
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,539
I can't close my eyes
to the things I've seen.

257
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,210
It must be stopped.

258
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,066
[Gasps]

259
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,956
[Creaking]

260
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,501
You.

261
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,420
The graveside service
is about to begin.

262
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,127

Blessed Mother.

268
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,822
It's just a tree limb.

269
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,534
Wind.

271
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,014

280
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,467
Finally up, huh?

281
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,052
Yeah.

282
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,763
I had this dream
about this girl.

283
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,806
Hi.

284
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,641
Oh, sorry to startle you, pal.

285
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,185
I... I picked her up
about 50 miles back.

286
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,188
Uh, Mike, this is Alchemy.

287
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,565
Chemy for short.

288
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,108
It's nice to meet you, Mike.

289
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,778
Hey, uh, Redge,
could you pull over?

290
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,196
I gotta take a leak.

291
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,490
Sure.

292
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,050
Redge,

293
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,719
this girl's in my dreams.

294
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,014
Except, when she's in 'em,
she's dead.

295
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,267
I think, for her sake,
she shouldn't get involved with us.

296
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,062
Well, your dreams
always come true?

297
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,148
No, not exactly,
but pretty damn close.

298
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,608
[Sighs]

299
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,735
Shit, Mike,
have you looked at her?

300
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,322
You know,
we been out here a long time.

301
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:14,244
And besides,
it gets hard on the road.

302
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,456
Redge, you're thinkin'
with your wrong head.

303
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,458
This girl... she's in danger.

304
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,919
Okay, okay.

305
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,756
So, she's in danger
with us or without us.

306
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,801
Or at least with us
we can protect her, right?

307
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,011
I mean, isn't that logical?

308
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,555
Yeah, in a horny sort of way,
I suppose it is.

309
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,060
Works for me.

310
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,482
So, uh, Chemy,
where you headed?

311
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,026
Um, to my hometown, Perigord.

312
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,445
It's about 20 miles
down the Interstate.

313
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,280
Perigord here we come.

314
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,370

315
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:39,746

Looks like a ghost town.

319
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,723
Things sure have changed
since I left.

320
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,517
Oh, yeah, how long
has that been?

321
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,645
I don't know,
must be ten years now.

322
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,147
We're gonna have
to find a place to hold up.

323
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,732
You know, my uncle owns
a bed and breakfast

324
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,359
on the other side of town.

325
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,362
And, uh, you guys
have been really nice to me

326
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,030
and I'm sure he wouldn't mind
giving you a room.

327
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,573
That'd be great.

328
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,495
[Male voice]
I've got them both.

329
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,710
Not my grandma.

[Alchemy]
Jesus, what the hell?

331
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,160

a look around, okay?

333
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,954
Maybe we can
get in a window.

334
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,967
[Redge]
See it?

335
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,510
Yeah.

336
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,054
Trapped.

337
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,722
Too scared to come out.

338
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,309
Nothin' to do
but watch and wait.

339
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,435

Damn!

342
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,877
I can't believe they just
abandoned the place.

343
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,295
And I don't have a clue

344
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,589
as to how the hell
we're gonna get in here.

345
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,883
Allow me.

a long time now.

And we're gettin' close.

Uh-huh.

Believe it or not,

353
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,991
you're gonna sleep safely tonight.

354
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,619
As long as I don't sleepwalk, right?

355
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,330
Yeah, well, just stay in bed.

356
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,248
We'll be back before dawn.

when you get back?

358
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,419

00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,823
I've seen 'em before
in my dreams.

364
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,035
They're the ones that exhume
the bodies for 'em.

365
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,622
Looks like just one?

366
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,999
Yeah, well, I'm gonna circle
around and make sure.

367
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,959

Oh!

370
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,444
They have no need
of your services.

371
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,739
Who are you...

372
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,951
to question the word
of God's servants.

373

00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,755
Whah!

375
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,316
You think that when you die
you go to heaven.

376
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,986
You come to us!

377
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,946

What are you doing here?

381
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,807
I have got to find
my grandmother.

382
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,643
Your grandmother's gone!

383
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,145
He's taken them all!

384
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,856
- He's harvesting the entire town.
- What?

385
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,984
Your grandmother, your grandfather...
we've got to warn people!

386
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,862
What's that sound?

387
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,947
You stay here.

What the hell's going on here?

413
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,273
- Huh?
- Uh, Redge.

414
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,067
Uh, this is Elizabeth.

415
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,508
- I'll get the car.
- Okay.

416

Wow.
[Chuckles]

417
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,990
So, then what happened?

418
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,909
Well, the priest saved my life

419
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,496
and just a few minutes later
I saw him get sliced and diced

420
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,747
by some...

421
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,584
flying Cuisinart.

422
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,003
So, you've seen it...
his sphere?

423
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,379
She's seen it, Redge.

424
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:32,049
I told ya, I had a funny feeling
about this place.

425
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,260
And he took my grandma.

426
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,055
- Turned her into some kind of...
- dwarf.

427
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,558
Yeah, I know,
we've seen it before.

428
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,435
He... he crushes them down and...

429
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,646
you know, ships them off
to God knows where.

430
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,148
Yeah, he got Mike's brother.

431
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,484
He got my whole family.

432
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,488
Well, I don't think we oughtta
wait around this place,

433
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,990
just waiting for him
to come and get us.

434
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,408
You're right.

435
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,996
But I think we only got
a couple more hours 'til daybreak.

436
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,999
And the traps on the doors
should keep us safe.

437
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,377
I'll tell you what... um, why don't
we just get some shuteye,

438
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,464
and then we'll just bang outta here
in the morning.

439
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,467
Yeah, I could use some sleep.

440

01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,464
[Elizabeth]
We're different, Mike.

451
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,049
That's why he wants us.

452
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,635
Because we're the only ones
who can see what he's doing.

453
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,764
I prayed so hard
that you'd find me.

454
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,309
You did.

01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,105

Shit!

465
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:44,176
Forget it, Mike.

466
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,886
There's nobody out there.

467
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,765
Looks like Chemy's uncle had a...

468
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,934
a cat or a dog or somethin'.

469
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,520
I... I can't tell.

471
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:57,815
who are we kidding?

472
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,735
I'm a 19-year-old kid.

473
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:04,238
You're a bald, middle-aged,
ex-ice cream vendor.

Thanks, Mike.

475
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,785
Can't kill him alone.

No way.

01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,249
How 'bout our families?

478

We just gonna forget
about them?

479

We're never gonna forget
about them.

480
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:23,966
But Redge, come on, we got people
who are alive right now

481
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,676

What's that supposed to mean,
if you're able?

496
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:35,764
All right, load up.

a doorway to his world.
