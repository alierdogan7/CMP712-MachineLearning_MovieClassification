1
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,719
Everyone deserves a death.
I was going to die of old age.

2
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,288
That was the plan.

3
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:23,888
Mitchell was going to go down
in a blaze of gunfire and glory.

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:32,128
Not cold and alone and shit scared.

5
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:40,408
He didn't think death
would smile at him first.

6
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:48,088
Death was always a certainty, the
punch line we could all see coming.

7
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:49,688
But not for Mitchell.

8
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:11,128
For a vampire, death isn't the end,

9
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,248
but the beginning.

10
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:29,688
Sorry, thanks for coming.
'So here we are.

11
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,848
'Overlooked and forgotten.

12
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:35,888
'Unnatural and super-natural.

13
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:39,768
'Watching the dance
from the sidelines.

14
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,688
'At least I was surrounded by
friends and family.'

15
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:47,248
Why won't anyone look at me?!
'At least I got that bit right.'

16
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:54,488
You know the worst thing
about being a ghost? It's lonely.

17
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,168
You'll give anything for that...

18
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,288
crumb of comfort,

19
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:05,248
that feel of skin against skin
that says it's OK, I'm here.

20
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,648
It's a hunger.

21
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:11,488
The most basic instinct.

22
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:17,048
You might even drag others into this
world of the dead.

23
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,408
Even if it means turning them
into monsters, too.

24
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:27,688
Then there are the ones like George.

25
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:32,248
The ones that should have died.

26
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:44,168
But shattered and bloody,
they walk away from the train wreck.

27
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:47,928
But at what cost?

28
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:52,568
They're scarred.

29
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:03,328
Aa-aa-aa-aargh!

30
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:04,888
Transformed.

31
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:11,328
They're monsters now, too...
aberrations,

32
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:14,048
the stuff of nightmares.

33
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:17,928
The big bad wolf.

34
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:28,688
So...

35
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:33,648
What have we got left
to look forward to, us refugees...

36
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:38,208
the flotsam and jetsam of death?

37
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:49,168
I was joking. Put them back in the
sink. I'll put them back in the sink.

38
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:53,088
'Maybe, if we still deserve
such a thing as mercy...'

39
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,488
I needed to do that.

40
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:57,768
' ..we find each other.'

41
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:14,808
Hello! 12 inch Mess of Meats.
Oh, thank you. Great.

42
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:19,008
Keep the change. So, how long have
you been delivering pizzas?

43
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,048
Uh...couple of months?

44
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,328
Could you ride a moped or did they
teach you? They taught us.

45
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,968
We had to drive round a car park.
Bet you hate pizza.

46
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:30,048
When your girlfriend's like, "What
do you want for your tea?"

47
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,208
I bet you're like, "Not pizza!"
I live with my dad.

48
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,088
Madness. See ya.

49
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,328
He could see me. He could SO see
you.

50
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:40,688
It's happening all the time now.
Not just with you two,

51
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:44,168
but with normal people.
I was putting out the recycling

52
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:47,048
and a van drove past
and the guy shouted "Slag!"

53
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:49,488
So who wants tea?

54
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:50,928
HE GRUNTS

55
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,608
What? You keep making tea!

56
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:56,888
Every surface is covered
with mugs of tea and coffee!

57
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:59,008
I go to make some tea and I can't!

58
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,408
There's no mugs, no tea!
It's all been made!

59
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,408
You can't even drink it!

60
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,928
You can't drink it,
but you keep making it!

61
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:10,448
Oh, oh, oh, my god,
it's driving me INSANE!

62
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:15,368
Oh, well, I like my routine, it
makes me feel normal. You're a
ghost!

63
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:18,608
Yeah, OK. Are you finished
with these?

64
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:21,248
Come on. Oh, you're both off then?

65
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:24,808
Yeah, we've got work, then it's his
time of the month. Oh. Great.

66
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:27,128
Tell you what, I won't miss that.

67
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:30,048
Used to have to curl up on the sofa,
a hot water bottle,

68
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:33,528
Pride and Prejudice. Anyone said
anything, I'd bite their head off.

69
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:35,688
Gosh, I suppose in your case that...

70
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:39,488
that is actually quite a possibility
isn't it, you know, biting?

71
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:41,368
We'll see you later.

72
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:44,808
OK, I'll see you later, guys.

73
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,088
# We were so pretty, now this is it

74
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:53,648
# You and I are too young
for this... #

75
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,808
You know, you should be
pleased for her.

76
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,848
She can be seen by other people now.

77
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:01,328
She can step out of the house.
Other people move in somewhere.

78
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,768
They get damp, no, they get woodlice.

79
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:06,608
Why do we get Caspar
the friendly ghost?

80
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,848
We've been over this.

81
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,848
There must be something unresolved
about her death.

82
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,648
That's what's keeping her here.
It's not fair...

83
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:17,648
Exactly. Whatever happened
to her, it was unfair.

84
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:21,328
No, it's unfair her being here. The
amount of washing up she generates...

85
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,168
So what are you gonna do?

86
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,208
Oh, well, I'll work for an hour,

87
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:31,368
then say there's a family emergency

88
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:34,928
and scoot down to the isolation room
before the moon comes up. Cool.

89
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,488
I'll come and let you out
in the morning.

90
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,208
VOICE: 'Mitchell...'

91
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:39,048
Jesus, Mitchell, how are you supposed
to find anywhere in this place?

92
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:42,688
I followed the signs to Intensive
Care, I ended back where I came in!

93
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:44,528
What are you doing here, Seth?

94
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:48,088
Herrick thinks recruitment should be
more tactical.

95
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:50,368
Those with money and influence.

96
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,688
No more tramps or people who
fall asleep on the night bus.

97
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,808
You had the right idea with Lauren.

98
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:59,128
At least she's easy on the eye.

99
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:02,808
This fella, I think
he's on the council or something...

100
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:06,568
Leave him alone.
What, you want to share?

101
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,288
No, I've...

102
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,848
I've stopped.

103
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,208
Yeah...

104
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:14,008
We've had this conversation,
Mitchell.

105
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,488
What blood type is he, anyway?

106
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:19,688
A-positive. Hmm.

107
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:24,288
A bit Jacob's Creek for me, but there
you go. Move away from the bed, Seth.

108
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:31,008
Remember that student, the guy?

109
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:34,088
When was it '58, '59?

110
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,848
Or you and Herrick and
that girl in the hotel?

111
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:41,608
Or the couple in the park?

112
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,448
You can't stop, Mitchell.

113
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,048
This is what we are.

114
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,488
Now, come on.

115
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,448
Just a taste. A sip.

116
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,888
I said leave him alone.

117
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:58,608
Or what? Look at you,
when was the last time you fed?

118
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:03,688
You're shaking, sweating. Get
into character and watch the door.

119
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:07,008
I've got a job to do.

120
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:12,288
I don't care if the coolest kid in
school is suddenly your mate, Seth.

121
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:14,368
Tell Herrick
the hospital's out of bounds.

122
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,768
A word of warning.

123
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:25,728
One friend to another.

124
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:27,768
It's cold out there without us.

125
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,488
I loved it, but I just
thought if I don't get out now...

126
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:41,728
Cos mates of mine, they got
married or they've had kids,

127
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,568
and they've just stayed, really.

128
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,928
Who was she? Lauren. Worked in A&E.

129
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,608
When did she die?

130
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:52,648
A couple of months
before you started.

131
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,248
She was beautiful.

132
00:09:56,248 --> 00:09:59,728
Oh. They're doing a memorial thingy.
Planting a tree. Hey, George.

133
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,528
Hey, Mitchell. Yeah, hi.

134
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,008
Shouldn't you be going?

135
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:07,328
Shit! I've got,
I've got to be somewhere erm, er...

136
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,208
Like now.
I've got a break in ten minutes.

137
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,528
I'll see you around then.
In your own time.

138
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:49,528
Hello? Uh, what are you doing?

139
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,128
This will be the site office when
they start building the admin wing.

140
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:56,128
Look at the state of it - furniture
all smashed up,

141
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,408
marks on the walls...

142
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,528
Have they been keeping mentals
in 'ere or what? Ha-ha-ha!

143
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:03,208
Oh, no.

144
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:17,728
..I just felt so alone,
do you know what I mean, Mitchell?

145
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,168
Mitchell?

146
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:21,368
Mitchell?

147
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:25,848
Are you OK? Your hand's shaking.

148
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:31,328
Oh. Yeah, I, uh, quit...
smoking, a few weeks ago.

149
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:32,928
So are you seeing anyone or..?

150
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:38,888
OK, that was me trying to be all
sophisticated and Marie Claire,

151
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:42,168
but it just came out Special Needs,
didn't it?

152
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,648
Oh, God, I'm such an idiot. I
shouldn't be allowed near people.

153
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,448
It's fine, it's fine.

154
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:52,448
But in answer to your question, no.

155
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,928
My relationships have followed
a similar pattern.

156
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:57,408
They've been brief,

157
00:11:57,408 --> 00:12:01,448
they...haven't ended...well.

158
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:04,728
And that has to change.

159
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:09,408
I can't keep hurting people. I
just want something good and normal.

160
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:12,768
But there are those who say I
can't do that. Well, who says that?

161
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:16,128
Can you give me one second?

162
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,608
The isolation room,
it's full of people!

163
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,168
We need to get somewhere now,

164
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,768
I've got 40 minutes before I change!
OK, let's go.

165
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:34,008
Here's fine, it's fine. What here!?
I can't pull over here, George!

166
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:35,368
Stop the car!

167
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:36,088
THUMP

168
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,008
This is... Whoa, whoa, whoa!

169
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,768
George, George, wait. What?

170
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:43,008
You haven't had time to find
somewhere. You can't just run.

171
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:46,528
You'll kill someone. What else
can I do? Come back to the house.

172
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,408
I'm not doing this in the house!

173
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:51,168
You can't keep it separate.
This is happening.

174
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:54,288
This is part of you! George,
it's safer there!

175
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:56,608
We can contain you! George!

176
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,928
# Start to wonder what his story
might be, what his story might be

177
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:03,048
# Cos they said he changes
when the sun goes down

178
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,688
# Yeah, they said he changes
when the sun goes down

179
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:08,488
# They said he changes
when the sun goes down... #

180
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,688
Hi, how are you?

181
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:19,208
Oh, oh, oh...

182
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,328
# ..Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo

183
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:27,008
# Isn't he Mr Inconspicuous?

184
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,168
# And he don't even have to sail... #

185
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:33,408
Oh, oh...

186
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,488
Sorry, sorry...

187
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:38,408
# ..when the sun goes down round here

188
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,728
# Round here. #

189
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,528
Hello, mate.

190
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,728
What you running from?

191
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:50,008
# They said he changes
when the sun goes down

192
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,408
# They said he changes
when the sun goes down

193
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:55,928
# They said he changes
when the sun goes down

194
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,168
# Round here

195
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,848
# They said he changes
when the sun goes down

196
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:05,088
# Over the river
going out of town... #

197
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,688
No, no, no, don't start the engine!

198
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,968
No, you're right,
let's go back to the house.

199
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:18,528
What? Well, like you said,
it's safer there.

200
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,568
So can we go?

201
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,208
Like, now?

202
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,488
All right, George? What's happening?

203
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:34,528
It's your time of the month. It is.
He's doing it here. I've hoovered!

204
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:37,528
George, what do you need? Close the
curtains so it can't see the windows.

205
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,648
And, er, put some music on. Loud.

206
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:42,608
Good idea. We'll say there's
a party going on. Annie.

207
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,928
Anything you don't want broken,
in your room.

208
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:47,688
Er, what are we supposed to do
while he's doing his thing?

209
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,008
Get the hell out.

210
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:54,368
Well, can I watch?

211
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,008
I just wanna see what happens.

212
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:06,768
This isn't like when you were six,
watching your cat have kittens.

213
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:09,248
It's, it's private.

214
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:11,648
Well, you've seen me
since I've died.

215
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:14,448
I think the rules of privacy
got a bit muddy.

216
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:19,768
Oh, come on. It's not like you can
hurt me. Maybe she should.

217
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,208
This is what I mean.
It's part of you.

218
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:30,488
OK. Erm, keep to the kitchen.

219
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,368
Stay out of its line of vision.

220
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:35,968
If it sees you, I don't know
what it'll do. Aargh!

221
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,208
It's coming.

222
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:57,928
# Change my picture
Smack my bitch up

223
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:05,608
# Change my picture
Smack my bitch up... #

224
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,928
I think someone's finally moved
into number 18.

225
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,328
Aaargh!

226
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:15,768
Aa-aa-aa-aargh!

227
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,288
Aa-aargh!

228
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:23,168
Aa-aa-aa-aargh

229
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:31,888
Aa-aa-aa-aargh!

230
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,648
Aa-aa-aa-aargh!

231
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:20,568
George?

232
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,488
George?

233
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,768
He's gone.

234
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,528
Hey. Hi.

235
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,088
Oh, no...

236
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,448
Where's, where's all our stuff?

237
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,848
What did it do?
We've salvaged what we can.

238
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:41,968
But there's about ten bin bags of
crap and wreckage

239
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,728
stashed in my bedroom.
I'm sensing a trip to IKEA.

240
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:48,328
And you know my feelings about that.
Look, why don't you two go out.

241
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:52,008
Let me finish up here.
It's the least I can do. Owen rang.

242
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:55,208
Owen who? Owen! Your landlord!

243
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,688
My fiancee, EX-fiancee.

244
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,128
He's coming round. In about... Now.

245
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:05,008
He's coming here? Why? He's over
from Saudi and wants to meet us.

246
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:08,048
Well, you guys are his
longest staying tenants.

247
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,208
All the others have found it,
er, strangely unwelcoming.

248
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,088
Why didn't you put him off?! I tried.

249
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,048
But she kicked me in the shin.

250
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,408
The shin, George! Sorry, can we
focus?

251
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,128
You're not going to be here
when he arrives? Of course!

252
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,408
Obviously I'll hide,
he's not gonna see me.

253
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:27,648
OK. I've written a list of questions
for you to ask him.

254
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:29,368
Are you screwing Janey Harris?

255
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,808
She always fancied Owen. If she'd
known when I died,

256
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:34,008
she'd have been here
before the ambulance crew.

257
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:37,648
Ah-h, "Has my sister had a baby?"
Cos they've been trying for ages.

258
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,648
I blame her husband. Robin. Works
for the Post Office.

259
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:44,848
Oh, my God, has everyone taken Stupid
Pills? This is Annie's ex -

260
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,648
Annie's ex, who buried her.

261
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:50,328
She can't be here, you can't
be within ten miles of here.

262
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:53,408
Well, I can't have him
in the house and not see him.

263
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,328
For Christ's sake, we were engaged.

264
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,448
And can you imagine, if he sees you?

265
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:01,968
The effect it will have on him, the,
the, the danger it'll put us all in.

266
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,008
This isn't about our safety.
You've lost your lover,

267
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:08,088
and now you can't bear
the thought of me seeing mine.

268
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:09,888
That's... That's... How dare you?!

269
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,328
Look, if she stays upstairs,
what's the worst that can happen?

270
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:16,288
I'll remind you of that as the crowds
gather with torches and pitchforks.

271
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:19,848
No, I'm sorry,
we have to protect the household.

272
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:22,408
YOU have just smashed up
the household.

273
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,608
It wasn't me...

274
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,568
Oh, that's that settled. Annie?

275
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:32,168
OK, OK. Erm and remember...

276
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:33,808
Janey Harris.

277
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:38,248
Crazy, you're all crazy... Oh-h-h.

278
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,608
Ask about the clanky tap. No, I will.

279
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:45,408
Just, just just leave
all of the talking to me.

280
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,968
Now, remember, we're two guys renting
a house,

281
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:50,528
it's, it's the most natural thing
in the world.

282
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:55,008
We just have to be totally
and completely normal.

283
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,648
Yeah, good luck with that.

284
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:01,848
Hey, how you doing? Good, good. I'm
Mitchell. Nice to meet you, Owen.

285
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:04,288
This is George. Hi, how's it going?
Yes.

286
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:12,168
Where's all the furniture? Um...
Oh, um,

287
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:15,288
we wanted a more,
uh, minimalist life.

288
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:18,248
It's so easy to get seduced by all
the clutter and debris

289
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,568
of 21st-century living, isn't it?
Isn't it?

290
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:24,368
To think having this sofa or that,
uh, uh, uh, chair

291
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:28,008
will bring you happiness when really,
shouldn't we be striving

292
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:32,928
for something more spiritual? More...
more Zen?

293
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:35,488
Oh. I thought maybe you were going
to redecorate

294
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,888
and didn't want to get the furniture
all painty.

295
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,168
Yeah,
that would have made more sense.

296
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:48,408
George, why don't you
go and see what that was.

297
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,968
Yes. Thank you, Mitchell. Can I get
you a drink, Owen?

298
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,848
Tea, coffee, there's a couple of
beers in the fridge.

299
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:57,968
Actually I wouldn't mind a beer.
I'm still on Saudi time.

300
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,288
What are you doing? We can hear you!

301
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:01,928
I just wanna to see him.

302
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:04,928
Look I can sneak down, I can hide.
Are you CRAZY?

303
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,608
He will see you and...
and die of shock!

304
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,888
Annie, that is not an option.
Most of the time it's fine.

305
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:16,648
Eventually the water comes through.

306
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,368
But it's driving George nuts.

307
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,208
OK. No worries. I'll take a look.
Like I said,

308
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,688
it's such a relief
having you guys here.

309
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:34,768
Er, it didn't work out with
the last lot of people...

310
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:36,608
Oh, cheers. I think they heard

311
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:41,248
about what happened and let their
imaginations run away with them.

312
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:45,488
You do know? About my fiancee?

313
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,048
A little.
Just what the estate agent said.

314
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,968
Yeah, I've hardly been back since.

315
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:56,168
You can imagine, it's still kind of
weird...being here.

316
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,368
What happened, exactly?

317
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:02,008
If you don't mind me asking.

318
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:04,808
Erm... We'd literally just moved in,

319
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,648
we were still living out of boxes.

320
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:11,288
And it was dark,
I hadn't sorted out the wiring yet.

321
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:15,488
And she was at the top
of the stairs and...

322
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:19,648
I don't know,
they said she must have...

323
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,328
fallen awkwardly or something...

324
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,768
What was she like?

325
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:30,048
Annie?

326
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:34,848
Oh, she was kind, funny.

327
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,688
Cleverer than she thought she was...

328
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,728
And she was mine.

329
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:49,688
I believe people can leave an echo,
in a place where they were.

330
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:53,208
I know the tenants before us
said they could detect something.

331
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,328
Maybe that's what it was.

332
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,728
They said it was creepy.
It's not, it's not creepy.

333
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:01,528
It's good. It's happy.

334
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:04,008
We like it.

335
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:07,248
What was it? What?

336
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,848
Oh, um...

337
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,808
it was, it was a pigeon.

338
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:13,328
A pigeon?
Must have left a window open.

339
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:19,528
Well, have you got rid of it?
I killed it. You, you killed it?

340
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,048
With a shoe.

341
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,008
You know what? I should, erm...
I gotta get going.

342
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,968
Yeah. Really? Aw, oh...
It was lovely to meet you, Owen.

343
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,368
Thanks for the drink. Any problems,
phone me.

344
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:36,048
Yeah. Like I said, we're really
happy here.

345
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,768
Really. Thank you. Really.

346
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:42,368
How'd you do that, stay so calm?

347
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:45,088
OK, shut up. You're a spy,
aren't you?

348
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:48,608
You've clearly had training, because
the way you held it together,

349
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:50,408
it was chilling.

350
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,288
He loved you very much, Annie.

351
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,928
The way he talked about you...

352
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:05,008
You made him very happy.

353
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:07,048
Oh, Did you ask about the tap?

354
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,728
Is this his?

355
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,008
What?

356
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:14,408
This bottle. Is it his?

357
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,448
Yeah.

358
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,688
Thank you very much. You want to
see it again?

359
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:37,208
Here we go, are you watching?
Are you sure you're watching?

360
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:40,928
You're not watching. Here it comes.

361
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:45,728
Thank you very much.

362
00:25:57,648 --> 00:26:01,208
Ah, There's my friend.
Sorry, guys, gotta go. One more?

363
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,928
No, no. Another time, I promise.

364
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,448
You didn't get my message?

365
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:09,808
This isn't your fucking larder,
Herrick.

366
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:13,328
This is a social call, nothing more.
We're really worried about you.

367
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:15,688
We're meant to keep a low profile.

368
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:18,088
Coming here,

369
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,968
attacking people in their sleep.

370
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:23,168
Attacking people in their sleep? Who
is attacking people in their sleep?

371
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:25,488
Seth said... "Seth said..."

372
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:27,488
Listen.

373
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:30,488
There's something you
need to know about Seth.

374
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,088
He's an idiot.

375
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:36,848
But it makes you think, doesn't it?

376
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:39,288
These rules about what
we can and cannot do.

377
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:41,448
Now for instance, here's a thought,

378
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:43,968
suppose the world
knew of our existence.

379
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,888
Suppose they had a choice...

380
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,568
Sorry, love, do you
do hot chocolate?

381
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:54,688
You do. Good.
Do you want a hot chocolate?

382
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:57,608
No. I'll have one hot chocolate,
please.

383
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,728
What time did you start? Uh, two.

384
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:04,408
Ooh, that's long shift.

385
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:08,488
So who do you get in here mostly,
this time of night? Staff, mainly.

386
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:11,888
Though we get parents too,
of the kids in the children's ward.

387
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:13,808
You can tell 'em a mile off.

388
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:15,888
They take it in turns
and they come in

389
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,888
and they order their coffee
but they don't drink it.

390
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,928
Well. I'm sure they very much
appreciate what you do.

391
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:26,488
Actually. It's fine. Well, you're
very kind.

392
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,568
Take care.

393
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,408
What was that? More tricks?

394
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:36,128
No. It's, er...manners.

395
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,168
So we declare ourselves.

396
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:42,568
And what then?
Start a mass conversion?

397
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:44,928
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
one step at a time...

398
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:48,008
But, that is exactly the kind of
left-field thinking

399
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,528
we need right now.

400
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:51,208
And those that refuse?

401
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,808
Well, as I recall,
you welcomed me with open arms.

402
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,008
God, that is terrible.

403
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:03,128
Taste it.
To save the lives of my men.

404
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:06,968
Yeah, how noble of you to take on
the curse of immortality

405
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:09,808
so that your friends could wither
and decay

406
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:12,328
in hospitals
and old people's homes.

407
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:17,488
I'm kidding. Just teasing you.

408
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,608
I'm willing to bet - you offer
people eternal life,

409
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:26,008
not just for them
but their lovers and children -

410
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:28,328
and the queues would stretch
a thousand miles!

411
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:31,088
Let's go up to the children's ward.

412
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:33,888
Those parents she was talking about,

413
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:36,808
you think a single one of them
would turn us away?

414
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,808
You've thought
about it, haven't you?

415
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:45,888
They had their chance.

416
00:28:45,888 --> 00:28:50,968
We left them to tend this paradise,
this Eden, and look what they did.

417
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:54,048
You know what I don't understand,
this interest in me.

418
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:56,088
Look. If things were to change,

419
00:28:56,088 --> 00:29:02,088
having you by my side, like it
was, back in the day, it would...

420
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:05,528
People admire you,

421
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:08,448
I admire you.

422
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:11,048
Despite your, er..

423
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,888
your eccentricities.

424
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:17,048
My eccentricities? Yeah.
I mean we all we all play a part.

425
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,208
But you... It's like you like it.

426
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:22,728
Plus now I hear everyone
tells me you're on the wagon.

427
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:25,648
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

428
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:28,128
Good. I don't. It's mental.

429
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:30,808
You're a shark, be a shark.

430
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:36,248
Besides, I suppose you've
got some fall-backs in place?

431
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:40,208
Fall-backs? Oh, just
someone you've been grooming.

432
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,168
So that eventually when you do fall
off the wagon,

433
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,048
you won't have too far to drop.

434
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:47,688
Oh, that's me.

435
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:54,568
Everything's about to change,
and nothing can stop it.

436
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:59,608
This is nature,
it's tectonic plates shifting.

437
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:04,808
And the only thing is, the only
thing you and me get to choose,

438
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,568
is which side
we're on when it happens.

439
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:11,888
Something to ponder.

440
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:27,928
Listen, I'm going
to that thing later.

441
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:29,848
The memorial thing, for Lauren.

442
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:31,888
You want to come? Um, I don't know...

443
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:34,648
Come on, it'll be nice.

444
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:37,128
Well, not nice so much as...
horrible.

445
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,448
I thought you were friends.
Not really.

446
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:41,288
A bit. Towards the end.

447
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,928
George? Hiya. Hi.

448
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:47,088
I need three pillow-cases, please.

449
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:49,648
Mrs Nixon's just vommed up
her fisherman's pie.

450
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,528
Thank you for sharing.
You've changed your shampoo.

451
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:55,768
It's minty.
Normally you're vanilla-y.

452
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:57,728
How do you know that?!

453
00:30:57,728 --> 00:31:00,328
Er, I've
just got a good sense of smell.

454
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:02,048
Erm, do you like it?

455
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:05,168
Yes, you smell like a polo.

456
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:08,208
Have you got a hole?

457
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:14,928
I'll, uh, see you later, yeah?

458
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:21,088
Shit, are you interested in her? No.

459
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,688
I don't know. Why, are you?

460
00:31:22,688 --> 00:31:24,808
Me? God, no.

461
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,808
I mean, she's nice, but...

462
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,928
if you're interested in her,
I could...

463
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,728
Oh, come on, it's not like you get

464
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:35,208
interested in people every day.
I don't want to discourage it.

465
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:39,488
She won't be interested in me. I'll
ask. Do you want me to ask? No, no!

466
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:43,408
Christ, this is so playground.

467
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,408
Well, welcome to being a bloke.

468
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,368
Why are you so anxious
to pair her off with me?

469
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:53,328
I'm not trying to pair you off,
that's... That's daft.

470
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:58,808
Let me talk to her. You see, I can
actually talk to women

471
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:01,288
without weeping
or setting fire to myself.

472
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:04,888
I don't know. I don't know.

473
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,408
Let me think about it.

474
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:15,328
Oh, yeah...have you seen my phone?

475
00:32:15,328 --> 00:32:16,448
No.

476
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:24,848
'Tap in kitchen
making very odd noises.

477
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:27,568
'Could you come and repair?

478
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:29,408
'This afternoon good.

479
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:33,408
'Hope you're well.

480
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:34,768
'From George.'

481
00:33:14,528 --> 00:33:15,768
Boo.

482
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:21,088
Lauren?

483
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:23,088
Surprise.

484
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,088
Did you enjoy my memorial service?

485
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,728
It's a shame Mitchell
couldn't make it.

486
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:30,048
Maybe he'll come to yours.

487
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:34,448
Aw, your face.

488
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,168
This must be really confusing.

489
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:42,808
Let me explain... Before I died
I had this one odd last thought.

490
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:44,608
And now I'm gonna make it yours.

491
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:51,008
You know all the things
that you were scared of as a kid?

492
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:52,808
All the monsters under the bed?

493
00:33:52,808 --> 00:33:54,248
They're all real.

494
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,648
OK, I'm kind of new to this,

495
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:06,008
but aren't you supposed to, er,
weep or scream or wee yourself?

496
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,008
Mitchell did this to you?

497
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:11,328
What, you know? You know what he is?

498
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:14,688
Wait a sec.

499
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:16,208
Come here.

500
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:19,768
Oh, my God.

501
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,248
A werewolf.

502
00:34:21,248 --> 00:34:23,008
Creepy.

503
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:35,928
Hey. Ooh, there's some bacon
in the fridge at home,

504
00:34:35,928 --> 00:34:38,568
that goes off at midnight.
Guess who I just saw.

505
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,848
Er...Yoko Ono?

506
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,928
No, Lauren!

507
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:46,048
I manage my condition. I hide
in a shitty bloody cellar

508
00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:48,128
or the middle of a forest. But you?

509
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:51,808
You buy a bottle of wine
and a packet of condoms!

510
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:57,648
What is the point of us trying
to build some kind of normality

511
00:34:57,648 --> 00:35:01,888
when you are attacking our friends
and turning them into monsters?

512
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,488
For Christ's sake!

513
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:10,848
we knew her. You let me go
to her bloody memorial!

514
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:14,848
How the hell do you think I've
survived for the last 100 years?

515
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:16,688
There's no escape from it.

516
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:21,248
I'm not like you, I don't have
days off. This is what I am.

517
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:24,408
Then why are we even trying?

518
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:39,648
Hey. Oh, shit, sorry, can I walk
on that? Have you just mopped there?

519
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,728
It's fine.

520
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:44,088
So do you want to come out
for a drink with me?

521
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:47,888
Yep, I've made a decision,
no more procrastination.

522
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:51,248
I've been meaning to do it for ages,
but I just kept putting it off.

523
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:54,008
That sounded a lot funnier
in the ladies.

524
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,488
What the hell.

525
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:09,648
Cool! Right, erm,
see you later then.

526
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:18,208
Oh, God.

527
00:36:21,568 --> 00:36:25,288
Owen, be not afraid.

528
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:04,328
George?

529
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:06,408
It's Owen.

530
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,808
George?

531
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,008
It's Owen.

532
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:19,608
Mitchell?

533
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:23,088
The TV's on.

534
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,848
Maybe he's popped out.

535
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:26,488
Hello?

536
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:29,048
I rang the doorbell...

537
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:33,608
Look, you don't have to do this,
Janey. You can wait in the car.

538
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:38,728
It's fine. I want to. You think
I should turn this off?

539
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:42,648
You say something?

540
00:37:42,648 --> 00:37:46,128
What?

541
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:47,648
Did you say something?

542
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,728
You're hearing things...

543
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:53,728
You gonna look at this tap?

544
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:57,888
Er, yeah. It could take a while.
Go and wait in the car, please.

545
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,768
And miss you doing DIY?

546
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,848
It'd be like missing an eclipse.

547
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,848
I have no idea what I'm doing.

548
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,528
Oh. Hello.

549
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,768
What?

550
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:29,128
Ahhh! Hello, hello!
George, hi, sorry,

551
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,248
we rang the doorbell,
no-one answered.

552
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:36,328
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's,
it's, it's, it's fine, it's, erm...

553
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:38,728
I got your text.
My text? About the tap.

554
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:43,248
The tap? Yeah, George. You texted me.
About the tap.

555
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:46,048
Right. The tap

556
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:51,128
But how silly of me, telling you to
come round when I wouldn't be here.

557
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,128
Sorry, I haven't even introduced
you. Er, this is my partner, Janey.

558
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:56,928
Janey? Harris. Hi.

559
00:38:56,928 --> 00:38:58,928
Right. Hello.

560
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:01,048
I'm going to have to
come back later,

561
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,928
take a look at the tank
in the attic.

562
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:04,488
Erm, so when are you not in?

563
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:07,128
I don't want to disturb you.
Well, it's hard to say.

564
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:09,208
There's usually someone here.

565
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,928
OK, well, I'll pop by
later in the week?

566
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:16,528
It was nice to meet you.
Yes, nice to meet you too, bye.

567
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:23,128
Annie.

568
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:27,448
I just wanted a chance to explain!

569
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:31,448
Look, you don't know him! You don't
know how he'd react, but I knew!

570
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:36,048
I just, I knew that if,
if he saw me again, he'd...

571
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:40,928
But he couldn't see me,
and now he's got someone else.

572
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:46,368
And now she gets to kiss him,
and watch him shave, and laugh

573
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,928
and I'm still in the clothes
that I died in.

574
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:55,008
I get nothing.
She gets him and I get...

575
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:56,808
I get you.

576
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:14,408
After I got...

577
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:22,768
After I lost everything, I ran away.

578
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:26,888
I met Mitchell and we came here
and met you and...

579
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:35,888
I'd just about come to terms
with what'd happened to me,

580
00:40:35,888 --> 00:40:38,888
and then I saw her.

581
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,328
My ex.

582
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:45,128
And she'd met someone else.

583
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:51,688
And it was so...savage.

584
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:54,808
So I know how it feels.

585
00:40:54,808 --> 00:41:00,368
It feels like losing everything
all over again.

586
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,088
How did it happen?

587
00:41:16,328 --> 00:41:18,848
We were on holiday in Scotland.

588
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,608
The place we were staying was on the
edge of this huge ravine,

589
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:28,928
and one night I decided
to go for a walk.

590
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,128
I've never been so scared.

591
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:36,288
This thing was...

592
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:41,968
Even at the time I remember
looking at it and being...

593
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:44,328
offended.

594
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:51,688
That thing in this world,
it was so, so wrong.

595
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,128
It attacked you?

596
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:07,448
This other guy, this, er...
another guest, he'd tagged along.

597
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,728
He was killed.

598
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:26,488
It literally tore his throat
and chest out.

599
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:34,648
Over there, he's there,
this way now, quickly.

600
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:37,088
I was only scratched. This way.

601
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,448
I survived.

602
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:48,648
Like me.

603
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:51,648
Like you. Hooray for us.

604
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:57,648
Why do you think Owen
couldn't see you?

605
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:03,328
I dunno.

606
00:43:05,288 --> 00:43:11,528
Maybe the shock of it was like...

607
00:43:11,528 --> 00:43:15,608
Just set me back. Like a relapse?

608
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:22,688
There's just so much of this
I don't understand.

609
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,528
So what did you think of her then?

610
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,448
Janey. She's...

611
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,728
orange.

612
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:41,368
She works in a tanning salon.

613
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,168
She thinks that looks classy.

614
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:47,328
I think she looks like Kilroy.

615
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:50,528
Well, you're much prettier.

616
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:52,248
And much nicer.

617
00:43:56,648 --> 00:43:58,968
And much deader.

618
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:24,248
Does that look like
a three or a five?

619
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:26,048
A three.

620
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:29,448
That's what I thought.
That's Becca's handwriting for you.

621
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:33,768
So if she give Mr Davies
his meds at three,

622
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:35,968
then he's gonna need 'em again,
hm, now.

623
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:37,928
But if she give 'em to him at five,

624
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:42,168
oh, he ain't gonna need
'em till ten o'clock. So ask her.

625
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,328
She ain't answering her mobile.

626
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,888
Gone out for a drink with your mate.

627
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:49,728
What mate?
You know. Him with the face. Where?

628
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,088
Where did they go? Christ knows.

629
00:44:53,088 --> 00:44:56,368
I would have asked but that would
have looked like I gives a shit.

630
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:01,288
I'm serious. If there's
another man there, I can't pee.

631
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:03,048
That's ridiculous!

632
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:05,928
I know, at my age.

633
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:09,688
OK, now you -
something embarrassing.

634
00:45:09,688 --> 00:45:14,008
Uhhhh. OK. It wasn't until six
months ago that I stopped phoning

635
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:15,528
my ex every time I got drunk.

636
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:18,808
Oh, God, I probably shouldn't
have said that.

637
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:22,008
No, it's sweet. It's tenacious.

638
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:28,128
Yeah, "sweet". Me, usually with sick
in my hair, going, "Gavi-i-i-n!"

639
00:45:33,928 --> 00:45:37,288
Oh, erm, I meant to ask you.
How's the not-smoking going?

640
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:39,568
Oh, not great.

641
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:42,328
But I'm thinking,
once a smoker, always a smoker.

642
00:45:43,928 --> 00:45:46,208
There's no point in fighting it?

643
00:46:01,368 --> 00:46:04,008
So, would you like to
come back to mine?

644
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:07,208
My flat-mate's out so we'd have
the place to ourselves.

645
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:16,728
Erm, is that a friend of yours?

646
00:46:16,728 --> 00:46:20,168
Well, lookee here.
Mind if I join you?

647
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:23,328
Aren't you going to introduce us?
I should explain.

648
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:25,808
Me and Mitchell dated.
Well, just once really.

649
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:28,128
It was sort of a date.

650
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:31,608
So where are we up to? With me
he did this whole thing about

651
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:34,208
the ancient machinery of the world.
Please don't do this.

652
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,928
At least he brought you out.

653
00:46:35,928 --> 00:46:38,648
We had to make do with a bottle
of wine from the supermarket

654
00:46:38,648 --> 00:46:41,568
and a packet of Doritos at my place.
I've seen you before.

655
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:44,408
Well, I had my photo
in the paper recently.

656
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:46,608
Yeah. Yeah.

657
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:49,528
I've seen you in a photo... Get up.

658
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:51,608
I want to see her face
when she works it out. Get up.

659
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,568
Well, you seem nice.

660
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:55,208
Maybe afterwards
we could hang out...

661
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:02,608
Oh, I, er, saw your furry friend.

662
00:47:02,608 --> 00:47:05,208
I was actually gonna feed from him,
can you imagine?

663
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,248
I'd probably have to
get jabs or something.

664
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:09,608
What do you want?
Did Herrick send you?

665
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:13,528
This isn't just about him.
Then what do you want? You left me.

666
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:16,448
You brought me into this
and then you left me.

667
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:19,488
I woke up surrounded by strangers.

668
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:23,488
It should have been you there!
Ever since then they've just passed

669
00:47:23,488 --> 00:47:25,408
me round, I'm like this orphan!

670
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:30,168
I'm sorry...

671
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:34,688
Come away with me.
There's places we can go,

672
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:36,728
where we can be safe from them.

673
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,768
They're not some dopey
abusive boyfriend.

674
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,688
You think anywhere's safe
from them?

675
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:43,688
They stay away from the smaller
towns, anywhere that's exposed.

676
00:47:43,688 --> 00:47:48,528
Wait... Oh, my God,
you actually think I want saving?

677
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:51,608
We can save each other,
this is what I'm trying...

678
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:54,088
We can save each other, OK?

679
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:56,448
You don't get it, do you?

680
00:47:56,448 --> 00:48:01,528
I want to kill! I want to feel
their blood dripping down my chin!

681
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:04,448
I want to see their faces
when they realise!

682
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:09,128
I wanna kill my parents, my lovers,
I want them to know.

683
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:12,008
Herrick's talking about
offering it first.

684
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:15,368
Christ, let's just take it.
Take their world.

685
00:48:15,368 --> 00:48:18,808
Tear their children to shreds.

686
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,608
Thank you. What for?

687
00:48:26,368 --> 00:48:30,568
You can't do this, Mitchell,
you can't choose them over us,

688
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:32,008
you'll lose everything.

689
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,888
Whatever it takes,
we will drag you back!

690
00:48:42,288 --> 00:48:44,448
You all right?

691
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:46,288
What was that all about?

692
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:49,768
Yeah, listen. I'm gonna head home.

693
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:54,048
Oh. Erm...

694
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:58,368
Oh, OK.
I just think it's for the best.

695
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,448
Look, was it that thing I said
about my ex?

696
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:04,808
That's not me any more. I promise.
This is about me, not you.

697
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:08,808
It's gotta be the first time
I've heard that before a shag.

698
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:12,088
That must be a record, even for me.

699
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:14,648
I'm sorry.

700
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:16,848
Can I walk you to the taxi rank?

701
00:49:16,848 --> 00:49:20,848
Oh, no, there's no need. Please.
I wanna make sure you're safe.

702
00:49:20,848 --> 00:49:23,968
Err, yeah, whatever.

703
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:25,488
Erm, I just need to pee.

704
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:50,568
Lauren?

705
00:49:57,568 --> 00:50:01,968
It's me. It's...

706
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:03,568
It's George.

707
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:13,448
Bad dog.

708
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:28,808
No, sorry, she's not in there.

709
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,288
Oh, Jesus Christ...
Call an ambulance!

710
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:49,048
Becca, it's OK, it's Mitchell.

711
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:51,528
Come on, baby, that's it,
keep looking at me.

712
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:55,608
Now isn't this a touching scene?

713
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:57,568
What did you do to her?!

714
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:01,008
Easy, tiger. What's the problem? You
just need to let her drink from you.

715
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:03,768
Becca, Becca, keep looking at me.
Keep looking at me.

716
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:07,328
It's OK, honey, he'll save you.
He can make all of this go away.

717
00:51:07,328 --> 00:51:10,608
Mitchell? Can you save her?
I can't... I can't...

718
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:13,408
She's losing consciousness!
You'd better hurry up.

719
00:51:13,408 --> 00:51:16,048
She's about two pints away
from being an organ donor.

720
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:18,328
Mitchell, DO something!

721
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:23,928
Mitchell!

722
00:51:23,928 --> 00:51:25,728
Not another one... I can't...

723
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:29,448
I can't. You did this.

724
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:31,208
You made me this, Mitchell.

725
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,688
This is all your fault.

726
00:51:33,688 --> 00:51:39,808
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

727
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:57,328
She, erm, she didn't make it.

728
00:52:16,648 --> 00:52:18,568
Is this how it ends then?

729
00:52:20,328 --> 00:52:25,808
They connect her to you,
you to Lauren.

730
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,808
Everything gets blown open.

731
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:31,528
We lose it all.

732
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,168
No.

733
00:52:33,168 --> 00:52:35,328
They have ways of doing this.
Come on.

734
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:39,888
What do you mean?

735
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:41,648
We've been around
for thousands of years.

736
00:52:41,648 --> 00:52:44,608
You think this is the first time
something like this has happened?

737
00:52:48,328 --> 00:52:50,528
They've branches everywhere.

738
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:14,528
Er, you wait here.
I'll go and find us a cab.

739
00:53:17,888 --> 00:53:23,768
Hey, Mitchell.
It's all about to start.

740
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:27,128
We're drawing up the lists.
Make your mind up time.

741
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,168
I choose them.

742
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,808
Pity.

743
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:38,408
Be seeing you.

744
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:42,528
And your little dog.

745
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:54,528
MUSIC: "Hurt" by Johnny Cash

746
00:53:56,888 --> 00:54:01,888
# I hurt myself today

747
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:05,888
# To see if I still feel

748
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:11,088
# I focus on the pain... #

749
00:54:12,688 --> 00:54:14,488
I'd forgotten what they were like.

750
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:16,488
The others.

751
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,088
They're predators.

752
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:25,488
Every inch of them
is just hunger and fury.

753
00:54:25,488 --> 00:54:30,688
The energy it must take him,
every minute, not to be like that...

754
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:34,208
Do you think he should
have saved her?

755
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:39,728
I think he did.

756
00:54:55,288 --> 00:54:58,288
We should go out. What? To the pub.

757
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:00,248
Well, anywhere. It'll do us all good.

758
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:02,888
Oh, no, I think...
I think I wanna stay in the house.

759
00:55:02,888 --> 00:55:07,688
No, yes. Let, let,
let me put some clothes on and...

760
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:09,408
No, I want to stay in the house now.

761
00:55:12,528 --> 00:55:17,088
Oh, look. I'm sorry.

762
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:21,688
I feel safe here.
There are monsters outside.

763
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:29,888
When it's just the three of us, it's
like none of them can touch us. OK.

764
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:36,368
# ..I will let you down

765
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:41,048
# I will make you hurt

766
00:55:42,768 --> 00:55:46,488
# If I could start again

767
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:51,608
# A million miles away

768
00:55:53,328 --> 00:55:56,688
# I would keep myself

769
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:02,928
# I would find a way. #

770
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:25,528
George! I know what you are.

771
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:27,088
We don't need to feed,

772
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:30,888
we can just...play.

773
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,928
My friends...

774
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:36,648
..will never understand you.
