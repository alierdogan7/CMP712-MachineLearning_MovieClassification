1
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:29,428
Reid, Ben, and Darrin
and I, we've been
friends for a while now.

2
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,032
They were just normal guys,
you know, like, everyday,

3
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,466
the kind of guys, you know,
you would just

4
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,068
go watch a football game with

5
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,237
or, you know, have a beer.

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,472
They're not crazy people.
They're just regular guys.

7
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,709
Um, and it's not like
them to just take off.

8
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,044
REID'S SISTER: <i>Reid was
the best brother</i>

9
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,311
<i>anyone could have.</i>

10
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,780
<i>He always took care of me.</i>

11
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:50,282
This is the old Reid
over here.

12
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,618
He was really great
at sports and really
liked to play the guitar.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,188
And then this is
the new crazy Reid.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,091
All this crazy reading
material about UFOs,

15
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,060
weird DVDs and maps.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,464
Reid stopped
returning my phone calls.

17
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,133
And then I got really scared
when he got fired.

18
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,635
As I said, he was
a great, great, uh,

19
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,236
asset to the company.

20
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,173
But about three months
before he disappeared,

21
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:17,509
he had a real change
in attitude.

22
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,479
He came to work late.
He spent a lot of
time on the Internet.

23
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,682
Stuff that we found
in his desk after he left,

24
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,484
a bunch of color pictures
of UFOs.

25
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,388
My brother wouldn't
just disappear.

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,789
Three people aren't just
gonna disappear.

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,158
Something is going on.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,726
And the fact that nobody
knows anything,

29
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,328
nobody will talk to us...

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,464
Everybody's avoiding us.
For what?

31
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,766
Somebody knows something,
and they're not telling us.

32
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,334
I would think that a person

33
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,338
who tried to sneak into
Area 51 and get video,

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,373
even a person who succeeded
in getting that video,

35
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,615
would be in serious trouble.

36
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,670

DARRIN: The camera
is the girl.

37

Like, what do you say
to these girls? (CHUCKLES)

00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,495
And then we'd start
a conversation

41
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,629
about, you know,
what the other one does...

42
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,131

DARRIN: This is a new thing.
It's revolutionary.

47
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,771
We just need Ben
not to screw it up.

48
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,273
Oh, I will not screw it up.

DARRIN: Yes, you are.

all you're bringing?

172
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,102
It's all I need, gents.

173
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,004
Suitcases are overrated.

174
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,441
DARRIN: Let's see.
Cowboy boots, bandanas,
and a pink wristband.

175
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,942
You're good to go.

176
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,043
BEN: All the necessities
of life, man.

177
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,512
BEN: Put it in your bag.

178
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,080
REID: You wanna borrow?
BEN: No.

179
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,549
I like my trash bag.
I think it's classy.

180
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,885
I could have
made this website.

181
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:00,986
DARRIN: Uh-huh.
Yeah.

182
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,120
You're packing a lot of stuff.

183
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,639
We're gonna need
all these suits.

184
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,157
BEN: Yo, Darrin.
I wanna show you
something I found.

185
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,458
BEN: A little story
for you guys.

186
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Iraqi insurgent thinking,

187
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,929
"I'm gonna do some
terrorist activity here
against Americans."

188
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,831
BEN: Uh, they think
no one can see 'em.

189
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,666
DARRIN: Where are you going
with this?

190
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,469
BEN: So, I think they remind
me of you and Reid.

191
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,671
"We're fine. It's
nighttime. You can't see us.

192
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,475
"Who can see at night?"
And...

193
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,512
"No! What's happening?
No! Run! Run, Ahmed.

194
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,481
"Oh, Ahmed, you're dead too."

195
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,782
And that,
my friends, is what happens

196
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,883
when you fuck with
the American government.

197
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,151
They fuck you up.

198
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,786
They're not gonna
be able to see us.

199
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,755
'Cause we got these.

200
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,989
REID: I have a plan.
There's always a plan, Ben.

201
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,724
Sure, there is.

202
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,093
BEN: Got to take this.
Whassup?

203
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,563
No, we're going out of town
for the weekend.

204
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,932
Secret mission.
Yeah, that's right.

205
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,806
Hey, is Ben still
on the phone?

206
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,542
BEN: No, I cannot tell you
where we're going.

207
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,264
(WHISPERS) It's a pretty good
opportunity to try
this thing out.

208
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,484
BEN: Sure. I don't
think girls...

209
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,485
REID: (WHISPERS) I'm just
gonna find his frequency.

210
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,687
BEN: What? Really?

211
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,121
REID: (WHISPERS) Ready.

212
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,490
(SIGNAL BEEPS)

213
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,661
REID: (WHISPERS) Ready.
BEN: Ashley?

214
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,763
REID: (WHISPERS)
Told you it would work.
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

215
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,885
REID: (WHISPERS) All right,
I'm going to cut it off.

216
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,902
Let him get back on the phone.

217
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,974
BEN: Hey, sorry,
I don't know what happened.

218
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,644
Yeah, we'll definitely...
Mini-golf date is set.

219
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,945
(SIGNAL BEEPS)

220
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,083
BEN: God damn it.

221
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,858
Stupid phone.
(CHUCKLES)

222
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,053
(LAUGHS)

223
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,221
What are you guys doing?

224
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,223
REID: The jammer works.

225
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,824
(LAUGHTER)

226
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,760
We need flashlights.

227
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,763
BEN: What are
the tennis balls for?
REID: Don't worry about it.

228
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,598
Four cameras. Yes.

229
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,935
Six batteries.
Two, four, six, yep.

230
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,338
BEN: You really need
four cameras?

231
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,740
DARRIN: Wearable. So we can
attach to our clothes
whatever, under our arm.

232
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,241
Comes pretty handy.

233
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,044
REID: And, as you can see,
that is you.

234
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,812
BEN: Sweet. There I am.
REID: There you are.

235
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,534
DARRIN: It will come in
handy at some point.

236
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,284
BEN: There's so much
cool shit on this table.

237
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,766
Ben, be careful
with that, all right?
Just don't drop that.

238
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,558
Okay, pills.

239
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,859
Just three, just three.

240
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,294
Okay, I'm good.

241
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,229
BEN: Darrin, where are you?

242
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,864
REID: Dude, we got to
get going.

243
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,265
BEN: Come on out, buddy.

244
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,603
Dude, those ammonia pills
are brutal.

245
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,972
You're doing a lot
of work there, Darrin.
(CHUCKLES)

246
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,640
REID: It's an essential
part of the trip, Darrin.

247
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,175
Hey, when did
we get this?
REID: Taser gun?

248
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,811
Taser. God, I love America.

249
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,147
Don't mess with
that thing, all right?
Oh! (LAUGHS)

250
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,749
DARRIN: Careful.
Careful, dude.

251
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,651
(CHUCKLES)
DARRIN: You can
shock yourself.

252
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,819
BEN: Do you really think that
can fuck someone up, though?

253
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,220
DARRIN: Yeah.

254
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,990
Come on. Come on,
let's get packing.

255
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,760
(GRUNTS)

256
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,762
DARRIN: Dude, are you
all right?

257
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,364
BEN: Okay, that hurts a lot.

258
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,298
REID: Are you okay?

259
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,933
Oh, man!

260
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,095
Oh, that will work.
That will take someone out.

261
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,371
Feel like I'm
more of a man now.

262
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,039
It does really work.

263
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,307
That's what you
look like right now.

264
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,069
Never leave dangerous toys
around children.

265
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:12,979
(SIGHS)

266
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,380
Let's go.

267
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,783
DARRIN: You nervous?
Huh?

268
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,018
We're doing it.
We're doing it.

269
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,286
It's gonna be awesome, dude.

270
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,621
This is what's gonna happen.

271
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,023
We're gonna drive
up to the border,

272
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,125
or wherever I'm dropping
you guys off,

273
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,727
uh, say our goodbyes.

274
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:29,828
You're gonna get
out of the car,

275
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,629
Reid's gonna get
out of the car.

276
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,015
Walk about 15 feet,

277
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,400
and then you're both gonna
be shot in the head by
snipers in the hills.

278
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,901
And I'm gonna be
crying in the car

279
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,103
because my two
best friends are dead.

280
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,137
We're not gonna
get shot, all right?

281
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,639
DARRIN: You'd cry for us?

282
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,140
The worst that could
happen is we get arrested.

283
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,908
And we're not gonna
get arrested 'cause
I got a plan.

284
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,945
It would be easier to rob
a bank than to break
into Area 51.

285
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,680
And people that
rob banks get shot.

286
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,181
That's 'cause a bank
expects to be robbed.

287
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,950
Nobody expects anyone
to break into the base.

288
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,785
BEN: That's because
it's impossible.
Ben, look at this.

289
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,021
Look at all this
land mass here, okay?

290
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,124
How are they
gonna patrol all that?
It's not possible.

291
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,325
This guy we're gonna
meet tomorrow, Norio,

292
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,160
walked across at daylight.

293
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,129
It's the size of Connecticut.
You can't patrol all that.

294
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,830
It's a top secret
government base.

295
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,666
There's probably a bunch of
other things happening...

296
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,734
There's no way they have dudes
all around this circle.

297
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,936
Yeah, there's motion sensors,
there's ammonia sensors.

298
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,172
There's all kinds of
security measures, but
we're gonna get around it.

299
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,441
You're gonna get around it
until you're shot in the head.

300
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,009
BEN: You guys are all talk.
This is never gonna happen.

301
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,978
I understand that

302
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,346
Reid's gone a little crazy
in the last three months.

303
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,714
No offense, Reid.

304
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,449
Who wouldn't want to see this?

305
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,452
You wouldn't want to see
footage of Area 51 inside
of the base?

306
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,754
I don't understand why
you're so confused
why I wanna go.

307
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,756
Because this has been,
this has all happened
very quickly,

308
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,191
and suddenly
we're going there.

309
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,394
And I don't know why
you have just accepted it.

310
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,997
All I know is that
no one has ever seen
footage of the base.

311
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,033
No one's ever been there.
No civilian's ever seen it.

312
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,402
We could be the first ones
to do it. That would be
the biggest...

313
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,804
What could be
bigger than that?

314
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,173
Really good job
manipulating Darrin, Reid.

315
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,341
(SIGHS) Just drive us
to the border, okay?

316
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:54,112
Hello? We're, uh, about
a couple hours from Vegas.

317
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,247
BEN: Yeah, he's talking
to that girl again.

318
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,949
DARRIN: She's not crazy.
You've never met her before.

319
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,751
Yeah, but he hasn't either,
man. He trusts her.

320
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,386
He already told her
what we're doing
and everything.

321
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,254
I don't know why he thinks
this girl's so legitimate.

322
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,023
DARRIN: You know,
her dad worked there.

323
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,859
No, her dad wrote a book
and claims he worked there.

324
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,394
You guys don't know anything
about this chick.

325
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,930
You're just trusting her.
I can make a fucking website.

326
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,264
Even if she shows up,

327
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,365
Reid doesn't really know
anything about her.

328
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,500
DARRIN: What's the deal, dude?

329
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,035
We're good.

330
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,403
She's gonna meet us tomorrow.

331
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,138
Just because
someone wrote a book...

332
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,340
If he went to MIT and did work
for the government,

333
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,410
it makes sense that
he'd be able to write
a legitimate-sounding book.

334
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,279
That doesn't mean
it's legitimate.

335
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,148
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

336
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,016
And then he killed himself,
so he's clearly stable-minded.

337
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,051
You don't have actual...

338
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,103
Ben, Ben, Ben, okay.

339
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,154
We know how to get past
the security measures
outside the base,

340
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,224
but we don't know what to do
when we get on the base.

341
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,860
I need his information.
She's the only one who has it.

342
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:45,296
So if she is full of shit,
we can go home?

343
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,998
If she's full of shit,
we gotta find another way.

344
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,967
DARRIN: You don't have
to say anything to her.

345
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,202
Oh, I'll say something to her.

346
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,537
DARRIN: (CHUCKLES)
Don't. Don't do dick.

347
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,172
Please don't.

348
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,944
There we go.

349
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,046
I talked to, uh,
Glenn Campbell.

350
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,448
Okay.
The guide,

351
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,049
and he's gonna
show us this, like...

352
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,451
Who are all these people
you're talking to?

353
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,486
Cameras, wearable cameras.

354
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,220
I'll wear one,
and you wear the other.

355
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,488
Okay.

356
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,990
We'll check for night vision.

357
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,291
There's no way
I'm wearing one.

358
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,492
You can get that shit
into a strip club

359
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,311
and the bouncers
and all that...

360
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,129
There's a lot of security
at strip clubs, I know,
trust me.

361
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,964
And if you can get
that shit in there

362
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,566
and no one finds out,
you're gold.

363
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:25,837
REID: Okay! Vegas!
Enough Area 51 talk!

364
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,839
That's the least
I've ever been excited
about going to Vegas.

365
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,908
DARRIN: Look at this.
Just like Candyland.

366
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,410
BEN: Look at that.
Take a picture of that beauty.

367
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,245
Hi, guys.
BEN: How you doing?

368
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,247
How are you?
BEN: We're gonna check
in for the Hooters.

369
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,316
DARRIN: Oh... Wow.

370
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,517
Beautiful.

371
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,386
BEN: Kidding me? No way.

372
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,822
Dude, this place
is ridiculous.

373
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,056
There's a pool table?

374
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,258
DARRIN: There's a pool table!

375
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,193
DARRIN: Reid,
what are you doing, dude?

376
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,062
REID: Check it out.

377
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,930
This is what I was telling you
about. It's JANET airlines.

378
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,265
You guys kidding me right now?
We're in heaven.

379
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,568
BEN: Going to look at boobs.
What are you doing, weirdo?

380
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,469
REID: Dude, check out
this thermal feature
on the camera.

381
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,871
BEN: Let me see.
REID: See, it's picking up
your heat.

382
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,005
BEN: Crazy.

383
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,240
REID: I got an idea.

384
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,609
Let me know if
it picks this up.

385
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,377
DARRIN: Oh, God!

386
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,879
REID: This is not gonna
be pretty.

387
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,347
BEN: Now look.
(ALL LAUGHS)

388
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,015
DARRIN: That looks like
boob prints!

389
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,917
BEN: Those are my blueprints!

390
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,119
BEN: Seamless
Gentlemen's Club.

391
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,241
DARRIN: We good?

392
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,290
Can't see anything.

393
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,029
DARRIN: Dude, move.
You're blocking my view.

394
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:25,530
REID: Let's go in
the private room.

395
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,600
Nice. Night vision.

396
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,169
BEN: Better get some
ladies in here soon.

397
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,136
I'm gonna be doing
this the entire time.

398
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,371
They coming in?
REID: Yeah.

399
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,073
They better come in soon.

400
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,174
WOMAN: Hey.
Ready for some fun?

401
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,876
REID: Hello, hello.

402
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,510
BEN: Yeah, I think
he needs a lap dance first.

403
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,511
DARRIN: That guy needs
a little bit first.

404
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,180
This guy?

405
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,582
BEN: Do these guys first.
I'll go after.

406
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,652
All right, all right.
I'm not gonna complain.
That's fine.

407
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,054
You know,
I'm happy regardless.

408
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,056
REID: You are
a gentleman and a saint.

409
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,358
You are a gentleman.

410
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
And a very good friend.

411
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,295
DARRIN: Hope you have
a good view over there, Reid.

412
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,098
REID: I am looking at it.

413
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,300
Looking and experiencing
are two different things.

414
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,555
BEN: See, Reid, it's a...

415
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,907
I don't know, but that
was the greatest
moment of my life.

416
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,475
Do you know how much
trouble we could have
gotten in for this?

417
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,010
To Vegas.
To Vegas.

418
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,178
To best friends.
To the trip of our lives.

419
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,584
REID: Rise and shine. Ben.

420
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,288
Hey.

421
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,322
BEN: What?

422
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,490
Get up.

423
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,392
What are you doing?

424
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,093
REID: Oh, man,
you look beautiful.

425
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,095
Why are you recording
me right now?

426
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,197
BEN: Look at all the fun
we could be having
walking down the strip,

427
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,632
drinking some beers.

428
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,935
She's there. She's texting me.

429
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,703
She's not crazy.

430
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,138
How do you know that, man?

431
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,706
'Cause I've talked to her.

432
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,208
BEN: We have no idea
who we just sent
our best friend to meet.

433
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,510
DARRIN: Let's hope she
can help us, right?

434
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,472
BEN: Yeah, what if this is
a setup or something?

435
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,215
Does he know
what she looks like?
How is he gonna...

436
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,952
DARRIN: I don't know.
Oh, wait, that's her.
Shaking hands.

437
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,320
BEN: Have you zoomed in?
DARRIN: Yeah.

438
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,687
What does she look like?
She doesn't look crazy.

439
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,589
Does she look crazy?
Are her eyes glowing?

440
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,959
No, she doesn't look crazy.
She looks normal.

441
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,428
Well, hopefully,
she's not legit or
he freaks her out.

442
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,362
And then we can go home.

443
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,697
Right.

444
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,466
He's pointing at us.
Should we wave?

445
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,735
She has something.
She gave him something.

446
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,370
She gave him papers
or something.

447
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,238
Yeah, he's bringing her
out here.

448
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,307
Okay, dude, just act
normal, all right?
Don't be a dick.

449
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,676
It's gonna be really
hard not to be a dick.

450
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,495
He's bringing her out here.

451
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,313
She's looking all sketchy.
They both look real sketchy.

452
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,514
So this is Jelena.

453
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,549
What's your name?
Jelena.

454
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,517
Jelena?
DARRIN: Darrin.

455
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,219
Hi, I'm Jelena.
Nice to meet you.

456
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,687
Good to meet you.
All right, guys.
Uh, follow me.

457
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,156
Okay.
Just like that?

458
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,038
DARRIN: She's not shady.
Is she, Reid?
REID: Yup.

459
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:38,162
BEN: Well, apparently,
we're going into storage.

460
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,764
'Cause nothing good happens
at a storage facility.

461
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,499
Case in point,
have you ever seen
<i>Silence of the Lambs?</i>

462
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,600
REID: It's one girl, okay?

463
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,534
BEN: She could
very easily kill us.

464
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,569
And store our bodies.

465
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,170
REID: We can take her.

466
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,332
Well, I know if a gun
gets pulled out, I'm running.

467
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,576
He became really paranoid.

468
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,745
He kept talking about how
our phones were tapped

469
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,346
and how there were
people following him

470
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,515
and all kinds of
crazy stuff like that.

471
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,585
And he made me promise
that if anything were
to happen to him,

472
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,654
I would move all his stuff
to a storage facility.

473
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,224
Somewhere secret
that no one would
be able to find.

474
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,027
He was extremely adamant
that I did it right away.

475
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,497
So the night that he died,
I brought his stuff over here.

476
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,633
And, it's crazy,
literally within 24 hours,
our house was raided.

477
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,735
They want what's here.

478
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,384
He was fired for asking
too many questions.

479
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,557
I was the one that found
my dad in the garage
that night.

480
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,161
Look at this.

481
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,662
They ruled it as a suicide.
He would have never
killed himself.

482
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,563
REID: This whole thing's
been redacted.

483
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,831
JELENA: I know.

484
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,473
BEN: Your father?
JELENA: Yeah.

485
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,804
Looks like a nice guy.
Mmm-hmm.

486
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,705
Yeah, he was a really
good guy. (SNIFFS)

487
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,377
Holy shit! This is a timeline
of all the employees.

488
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,645
This is incredible.

489
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,346
Thousands of people's
medical records.

490
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,149
Malignant prostate?

491
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,484
I don't know why
he'd have that.

492
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,618
JELENA: Come here.
REID: What?

493
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,722
Yeah, these are my dad's
maps of the base.

494
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,091
REID: Seriously?

495
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,162
JELENA: Of course, he wasn't
allowed into all the buildings

496
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,131
but this is what he's got.

497
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,233
Everything above
ground is just a front.

498
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,168
The real base is
a mile underground in S4.

499
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,736
He wasn't allowed in there.

500
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,706
REID: Marked different
staircases and elevators.

501
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,341
That could be how
you get underground.

502
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,076
It would be real helpful
when we get to the base.

503
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,810
JELENA: Even if you make
it on the base, this isn't
going to help you.

504
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,613
You need fingerprints.
You need a badge.

505
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,582
They have access codes
that change every day.

506
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,550
Well, your dad
didn't have access to it,
so he obviously snuck in.

507
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,119
JELENA: Yeah,
and my dad's dead.

508
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,420
BEN: You really want to
go through with this?

509
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,822
REID: Yeah, I don't have
a choice.

510
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,225
Looks like your dad
was able to get into S4

511
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,160
but just not, sort of,
parts...

512
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,895
Well, he was
following someone.

513
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:54,332
This guy, I know I have
his picture in here
somewhere,

514
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,834
who did have
full S4 clearance.

515
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,870
And I know that my dad
was following him.

516
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,741
There we go. The guy.

517
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,610
I don't know his name.

518
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,811
I just know
that that's the guy
my dad was following

519
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,630
and the reason
why he got fired.

520
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,448
REID: Well, if he does
still work there,
I think we could find him.

521
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,850
He probably lives
in or around Vegas.

522
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,421
Reid, if this is
for real, this is what
got her father killed.

523
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:22,426
Yeah.

524
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,494
REID: We'll be careful.

525
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,363
Hi. Norio?

526
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,864
Yes.

527
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,766
So let's say we get to the top
of the ridge here,

528
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,301
say I want to do more
than just look at it.

529
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,470
Say I want to
get down into S4.

530
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:37,808
Get out of the car
and just keep walking
along this boundary fence.

531
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,345
Most of the heat sensors
and motion detectors

532
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,348
are along this
Groom Lake dirt road.

533
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,750
REID: There are no motion
sensors over here?

534
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,818
NORIO: There are very little.

535
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
Rattlesnakes?

536
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:50,755
Yes, there's rattlesnakes
all over.

537
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,856
S4 is down here, right?

538
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,257
S4 is down here.

539
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,793
Can we get over that mountain?

540
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,197
As long as you're
not detected.

541
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,398
The JANET airlines.
The terminal.

542
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,900
737 outbound jets right there.

543
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,302
The one with the red stripe?

544
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,903
NORIO: Yes.

545
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,105
In fact, you can see
the parking lot over there.

546
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:10,942
REID: Darrin, I think
this is his flight.

547
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,510
DARRIN: How do you know?

548
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,378
REID: The tail numbers.
We gotta go.

549
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,180
DARRIN: Right now?
REID: Yeah.

550
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,416
We got to get there
before they deplane.

551
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,178
DARRIN: I'm going as fast
as possible, man.

552
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,562
Take a right, take a right.

553
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,692
Am I going in there
or what am I doing?

554
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,794
Okay...
What?

555
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,395
This is it.
This is JANET terminal.
This is JANET?

556
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,331
There's a lot of cars.

557
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,699
The dude could be anywhere.

558
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,837
So they fly the employees
in and out of this base
every day?

559
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,938
Yup.

560
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,006
Here?

561
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,474
Yup, every day.

562
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,409
Who's JANET?

563
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,812
Uh, it stands for
Just Another
Nonexistent Terminal.

564
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,013
That's the rumor.

565
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:50,748
It's a stupid rumor.

566
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,483
DARRIN: I think I see him.
REID: Can you see him
on there?

567
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,485
DARRIN: Yeah, yeah.
I'm zooming in.

568
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,486
White hair, glasses,
getting in a small black car.

569
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,589
DARRIN: Oh, shit.
Reid, Reid, it's him.

570
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,523
DARRIN: Right there,
right there.
REID: Follow him.

571
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,958
BEN: Okay.

572
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,027
REID: Give him
a little space though.

573
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,295
Put it in drive.
Here we go, here we go.

574
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,830
All right, go.

575
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,265
So I'm just
following this guy?
Yeah.

576
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,634
Can you zoom in on him?

577
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,435
DARRIN: Yeah. It's him, dude.

578
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,004
It's definitely him.
I can see him in his mirror.

579
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,640
He's wearing black glasses.
White hair.

580
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,522
He's the exact guy
in the picture.

581
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,278
BEN: So do you have
a plan though?

582
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,013
I got a few ideas.

583
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:24,682
Would you like to share
them or are we keeping
that to ourselves?

584
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,350
Okay.

585
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,752
What if he's a janitor?

586
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,287
He's got to be
a high-level employee.

587
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,554
What, are you just gonna
hit him over the head?

588
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,989
Dude, don't lose him.
I'm not losing him.

589
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,925
Speed up a little bit.

590
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,994
DARRIN: What if that guy
knew that Jelena's dad
was following him?

591
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,530
What if this is the reason
Jelena's dad was killed?

592
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,532
I suddenly don't
like this idea anymore.

593
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,833
You're doing a great job.
Thank you.

594
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,335
It's almost like you've
done this before.

595
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,405
I actually might
take up a new career.

596
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,539
REID: Stalking people?

597
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,607
DARRIN: Following people?

598
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,876
Uh, PI. Thank you.

600

Dude, put the camera down.
Put the camera down.

601
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:02,172
All right, stay back,
stay back. Let some cars
get between.

602
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,391
Stay a good, like,
50 yards behind him.

603
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,626
More than 50.

605
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,766
You want me to
just drive past him?

606
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,248
Drive past him.
Drive past him.

607
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,906
DARRIN: This is his house.

REID: Put the camera down.
DARRIN: Relax, relax.

609

REID: Go down the end
and turn around.

610
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,110
So what's the plan,
this stakeout?

611
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,878
We wait.
For how long?

612
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,113
We gotta stick around
to see if he leaves.

Definitely did not plan
this stakeout very well.

Supposed to have coffee.

617
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,557

What do you think, dude?
If he doesn't leave, plan B?

Reid?

00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,074
Yeah, what is
the plan here, Reid?

Why would you not tell me
you have something?

eat the whole fucking bag.

I'm not gonna
eat the whole bag.

you guys were there or not,

break in.

I would be skeptical, too,

837
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,861
if I thought there were
these comic book
little green aliens.

838
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,265
They're not these furry,
little sweet creatures,

839
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,903
they're scary, man.

840
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,472
The one that he saw had
rows of teeth, you know,
like, several back...

841
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,309
The eyes, black.
Just endless black pit.

842
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,311
It's like white blood,
you know?

843
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,712
They shed their skin.

844
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,381
He's like a snake,
but these giant patches...

845
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,818
(SCOFFS) It's not just
your body that they probe,
they probe your mind.

846
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,587
They can control your mind.

847
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,489
Throw you against the wall
out of nowhere.

848
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,857
You can tell when
they're around, too.

849
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,692
You get these
migraine headaches.

850
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,294
I mean, beyond anything
you could ever imagine.

851
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,096
You get nosebleeds.

852
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,897
You hear about those people
having those near-death
experiences,

853
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,401
and the whole thing about,
"Walk into the light!
Walk into the light!"

854
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,736
That's what that is.

855
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,305
It's almost like you cease
to exist for a bit.

856
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,773
You have no idea
what happened at the time.

857
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,775
It's just white.

858
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,679
Like eternal endless white.

859
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,382
You can't see
where the floor stops
and the ceiling starts.

860
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,344
REID: How do you even know
you were on the ship?

861
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
MAN: You don't.

862
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,524
Experimentation,
the dissection, everything
we've done to them,

863
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,592
it's Guantanamo Bay, man.

864
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,634
You just better hope
they never get out.

865
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,731
They have their own
police department,

866
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,300
they got an underground
transportation system,

867
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,701
and they have
their own government.

868
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,604
Area 51, man,
it's the 51st state.

869
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,573
REID: Here it is.
It's right up
there on the left.

870
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,408
BEN: This is a little creepy,
man. What if this guy's crazy?

871
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,243
REID: He's fine.
He's totally normal.

872
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,212
Glenn?
Yeah. You Reid?

873
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,914
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

874
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,216
Reid's finally found
his best friend.

875
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,951
BEN: Hey, what's up, man?
DARRIN: Where are we going?

876
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,287
I guess you're coming
to Area 51, eh?

877
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,888
This road will take us
down to the border.

878
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,758
It's one of the main
access roads to the base.

879
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,826
BEN: What kind of security
might we run in to?

880
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,828
At the border, always
on the same hill.

881
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,430
You see the camo dudes,

882
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,332
you see two guys
in a white Jeep Cherokee.

883
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,900
Right.

884
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,635
They're always there,
24 hours a day.

885
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,238
I'll drive along with
the little frequency detector

886
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,341
and when this thing pops off,

887
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,343
it tells me,
"I just ran over
a road sensor."

888
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,545
Slow down. Slow. Slow.

889
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,587
GLENN: Look around in
one of these bushes
and see if you can...

890
00:36:58,684 --> 00:36:59,684
Oh.

891
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,153
Right there.
GLENN: Okay.

892
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,688
REID: Oh, yeah.
GLENN: If you didn't
know this was here,

893
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,290
this would look like
a plate of grass to you.

894
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,626
There's your antenna.

895
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:13,430
There's no way you'd find
this without some sort
of electronic aid.

896
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,533
Look at that
"US Government Property."

897
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:17,735
We're on public land,
mind you.

898
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,336
All right, there we go.

899
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,707
Okay.

900
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,643
REID: 2-0-2-2.

901
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,346
GLENN: This was gonna
send out the code 022.

902
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,548
The camo dudes are gonna
come along and investigate,

903
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,450
and see who's
approaching the border.

904
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,351
This is the simple stuff
we find outside the border.

905
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,554
Inside the border,
you may have your
ammonia sensors,

906
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:40,023
you may have
your heat sensors.

907
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:44,461
If you can defeat this unit
out here on public land,

908
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,863
you'd probably
be able to defeat
what they have inside.

909
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,632
REID: There's a car
over there.
GLENN: That's them.

910
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,400
BEN: That's the camo dudes?
GLENN: Those are
the camo dudes.

911
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,702
BEN: I'm not gonna
get a sniper bullet
in my head right now, am I?

912
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,537
Just pull over on to the side
of the road, right here.

913
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:55,779
Just pull up to that area.

914
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,508
BEN: Is there a guy there?
Can you see?

915
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,644
GLENN: You got a, uh,
telephoto on that?

916
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:01,745
REID: Yeah, I zoomed in
on him.

917
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,230
GLENN: Can you see
if there's...

918
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:04,714
REID: They even got
the binoculars on us
right now.

919
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,716
GLENN: Really?
Two guys, right?
REID: Yep.

920
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,852
GLENN: Up there in that ridge,
there are two tripods.

921
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,553
BEN: There's one.

922
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,721
REID: One of them is
pointing toward us.

923
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,823
BEN: And there's
another one right there.

924
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,924
GLENN: The other one is
pointing toward the road
we just came down.

925
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,628
So, if you have a vehicle,
there's no real sneaking in.

926
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,663
BEN: We're really getting out
of the car right now?

927
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,364
REID: Yeah.

928
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,733
These are your
camo dudes up here.

929
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,302
Are you the happiest
human being ever, right now?

930
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,970
Yeah.
REID: This is amazing.

931
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,637
BEN: Right over there.
Everything you've ever wanted.

932
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,707
This is almost as exciting.

933
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,325
Yeah.
This could be
used against you...

934
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:33,942
BEN: If I had a choice,
I'd be at a pool
in Vegas right now.

935
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,045
DARRIN: We made it
to the border.

936
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,847
GLENN: Oh, there's
another one.

937
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,991
(WIND RUSTLING)

938
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,092
MAN: We're tourists, guys.
Sorry.

939
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,327
So, what brings you out here?

940
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,628
MAN: Oh, work.

941
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,830
So, I'm really just out here.

942
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,699
Since I was close,
I decided I should

943
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,534
come by and do
the touristy thing...

944
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,736
MAN: You guys have fun.

945
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:59,857
Okay. All right. Thanks.

946
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,574
GLENN: Here's a guy
with no license plates.
Yeah, you're a tourist. Sure.

947
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,775
REID: That guy is
a security guard, huh?

948
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,444
GLENN: Undercover.

949
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,878
Just don't do
anything stupid, okay?

950
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,746
You got it.
Thank you, Glenn.

951
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,081
BEN: Later.

952
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,523
See, I told you
he wasn't weird.

953
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:20,457
DARRIN: Right over there.
It's so close.
I can taste it.

954
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,492
Now let's go talk to that guy.
DARRIN: What?

955
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,361
Huh?
Let's go talk to
this guy. Come on.

956
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,083
Err...

957
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,701
Hey, uh, sir, what are
you looking for?

958
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,246
See anything?

959
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,084
You think I wanna come
out here? They make me
come out here!

960
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,519
BEN: Okay. All right.
Let's go.

961
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,676
I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)
I didn't mean to do that.

962
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,557
Don't talk to the locals.

963
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,027
REID: Ben, don't antagonize
strangers like that, dude.

964
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,662
BEN: What? I didn't know
he was gonna be crazy, dude.

965
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:00,463
REID: (WHISPERS)
The door's open.
BEN: What?

966
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,731
Did you leave it open?

967
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,832
No.
We have all our
stuff in there.

968
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,074
I didn't leave it open.

969
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:07,287
DARRIN: Dude, open the door.

970
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:08,368
DARRIN: You kidding me?

971
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:11,041
Hello?
BEN: Fuck.

972
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,122
BEN: Dude.
Anybody here?

973
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:15,879
REID: It looks the same.
DARRIN: It's all here,
I think.

974
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,481
It's everything.

975
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,483
What if someone fucking
bugged the place.

976
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,684
REID: Hello?

977
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,188
DARRIN: What the fuck?

978
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,790
Hey.
Hey.

979
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,491
BEN: Oh, my God.
DARRIN: Jesus Christ!

980
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:29,893
DARRIN: Dude, are you...
I knew you'd get here.

981
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,461
Hi, guys.
DARRIN: What are you
doing here?

982
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,562
Yeah. What are you doing here?

983
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,830
We gotta get moving.
Let's go.

984
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,598
I'm coming with you guys.
DARRIN: What?

985
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,567
JELENA: I asked the guy
up front.
BEN: Fuck.

986
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,569
They've got ammonia sensors
all over the base,

987
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,538
so these neomycin pills
will mask our ammonia levels.

988
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,173
JELENA: Okay.
Darrin and I have
been taking them

989
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,807
for a few days now,
so we're gonna have
to triple your dosage.

990
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,609
Well, are they
gonna work?

991
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,511
Hopefully. Might have
to test your levels
before we leave.

992
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,673
Keep moving.
We have a lot to do.

993
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,981
Terrible idea.

994
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,918
Darrin, you need to take two.

995
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,553
Say something, man.
You shouldn't...

996
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,054
DARRIN: I don't know
what that is.

997
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,590
Just tell him that
it's not okay with you, dude.

998
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:01,891
DARRIN: (SIGHS) Hey.

999
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,093
Maybe we don't
bring her with us.

okay? She's helped us out,

she gave us the maps.

be way too high.

It means we have

all around the base,

and they pick up
your body heat.

00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,313
So what we're gonna
do is, we're gonna
pump Freon through this suit.

and that'll mask
our body temperature.

and put on the thermal?

1326
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,579
DARRIN: He didn't notice us.
He's wearing headphones.

1327
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,644
Okay here. On 10.

1328
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,579
Yeah. We gotta find a way.
We gotta get to a stairwell.

1329
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:53,415
DARRIN: Okay. There's
an exit over there.

1330
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,817
There's an exit over there?
DARRIN: Behind you,
behind you.

1331
00:55:58,622 --> 00:55:59,622
It's a dead end.

1332
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:05,761
Get down. Get down.

1333
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,764
Okay, we're clear. Get down.

1334
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:14,104
DARRIN: Shit!

1335
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,879
Shit. Shit.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

1337
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,918
Go, go, go, go.

1338
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,694
Fuck, that was close.

1339
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,656
Dude, it goes way
the fuck down there.

1340
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:42,464
This is Stairwell B.

1341
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:45,667
S4, it should be down there.

1342
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,777
Let's keep moving.
DARRIN: Yep.

1343

1344
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,772

DARRIN: Yeah.

1345
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,027
Reid, he's coming. Reid.
Reid, he's coming.

1346
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:32,448
There's a locker room.
I think it's empty.

1347
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,450
Okay.

1348
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,553
JELENA: He didn't see you,
did he?

1349
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:38,554
DARRIN: No, no, no, no.
I think we're good.

1350
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:39,556
Jesus Christ!

1351
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,705
Just wait it out for a minute.
Let everything pass.

1352
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,176
JELENA: What the fuck is that?
DARRIN: Did you hear that?

1355
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,147
DARRIN: Must be automatic.

1356
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:24,500
Listen.
What's that?

1357
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,268
What is that?
REID: Yeah.

1358
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,551
DARRIN: Where is it
coming from?
REID: Here.

1359
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,694
JELENA: What is it?
DARRIN: I don't know.

1360
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,759
DARRIN: What the fuck.

1361
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:38,941
It's still here somewhere.

1362
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,193
It's here.

1363
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,663
DARRIN: They might be useful
to know where the guards are.

1364
00:58:56,967 --> 00:59:00,202
Also got some kind of suit.
Bulletproof vest, almost.

1365
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,644
JELENA: What the hell?
DARRIN: Look at this.

00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,843
JELENA: Are you okay?

1369
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,045
DARRIN: Dude, your nose
is bleeding, are you okay?

1370
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,015
DARRIN: Hey, let's go.
JELENA: You okay?

1371
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:14,049
DARRIN: Jelena, put it back.
Let's go.

1372
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,250

I think we're good.

Dude, what was that noise?

1376
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,087
I don't know.
Let's keep moving.

1377
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,184
DARRIN: Dude.

1378
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,290
I can't see anything.

1379
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:59,361
This is it. Level 40.

01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,400
Where are you going?

1381
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,949
This is fucking...
It's huge.

1382
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,279
DARRIN: Shit.

1383
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,748
Look at this.

1384
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,216
It's fucking... What is this?

1385
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,719
Are these cages?
What the fuck?

1386
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:24,953
REID: Yeah, they look like
holding cells.

1387
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:25,955
DARRIN: Dude!

1388
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:29,124
Oh my God, it's weird.

they're hot.

it's fucking warm.
That's weird.

1391
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:36,264
REID: Darrin, check this out.

1392
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:38,066
DARRIN: Holy shit.
What is this?

1393
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,970
That's weird.
What do you think's in there?

1394
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,406
REID: It's like they're
getting sucked in.

1395
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,908
Come on. We gotta keep moving.
Let's go.

1396
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,830
We gotta get through
the lab to get to
the access point for S2.

(ENGINE WHIRRING)

1398
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,555
Oh, fuck. Go hide.
Get down.

1399
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,179
DARRIN: What's he doing?

1400
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,015
REID: I think he's going
to the lab.

1401
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,442
REID: Is he still out there?

1402
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:17,339
I don't know the code.
It's not a card.

1403
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,440
DARRIN: I have an idea.
With the thermal.

1404
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,042
Yeah.

1405
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:21,209
(PANTING)

1406
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,255
DARRIN: Okay, now.

1407
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,356
Maybe the thermal...

1408
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,457
REID: What do you mean?

1409
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,292
DARRIN: Watch. I turn it on.

1410
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,828
Now, the last button he pushed
would be the warmest.

1411
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,264
Eight must have been
pushed first, and then
the seven,

1412
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:44,366
and then the three,
and then the four, okay?

1413
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,334
So that means what?
4-3-7-8.

talked about these R&D labs.

1419

he wasn't crazy.

white blood in there.
REID: We gotta go.

1429
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:27,008

that it's blood.
DARRIN: I know,

1430
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,110
but remember the guy
at the bar mentioned that.

1431
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,211
REID: Yeah, maybe that's it,
I don't know. Okay.

1432
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:30,345

01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,026
From this planet.
That's incredible.

1492
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,862

anything for me.

1493

military technology.
This is something else.

get in here.

1495
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:37,405

there's an opening up here.

1496
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,191
DARRIN: Amazing.

1497
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:40,976

know what's in there.

be careful, dude.

1500
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:46,181
Easy, easy.

1501
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,354
Holy shit.

1502
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,222
JELENA: What?
DARRIN: Jelena, it closed.

1503
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,657
JELENA: What do you mean,
it closed?

1504
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,509
DARRIN: I mean, the door,
the hatch, it closed.

1505
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,360
Just, he climbed in and
it closed right behind him.

1506
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:01,043
I don't...
It's just not there anymore.

REID: (WHISPERS)
What are they?

1508
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:07,168
They look like sleeping pods.

1509
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,240
There's like nothing in here.

1510
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,242
Why there's, like,
no controls or anything?

1511
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,481
I can't believe I'm
in an alien spacecraft.

Like, a button or something?

1519
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,372
DARRIN: (SIGHS) I don't know.
It's just... It's all smooth.
It's nothing.

1520
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:46,608
It's nothing.
Come on, what the fuck?

1521
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,943
What is he doing?

1522
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,245

1523
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:51,947

1524
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:54,176
DARRIN: How did I do this?

1525
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,959
DARRIN: Reid.
Darrin.

1526
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,493
DARRIN: You all right?
Darrin, man, you gotta
get down here.

1527
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,962
This is amazing.
DARRIN: No, we gotta go, man.

1528
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:07,996
No. I'm not leaving.

1529
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,297
Could you guys see me?

1530
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,499
No we couldn't see you.
JELENA: Reid, come on.

1531
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,700
Dude, the whole
thing went transparent.

1532
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:13,501
No, man, it was
completely soundproof.

1533
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:14,986
DARRIN: All right,
we gotta go.

1534
01:06:14,987 --> 01:06:16,470
Reid, if that door
closes again, we're
stuck here. Let's go.

1535
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,473
All right.

1536
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,275
Here. Here. (SIGHS)

1537
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:22,177

1538
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,545

it would be here,
I told you that.

1540
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,214
There's gotta be more.

1541
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,615
I was just inside that thing.
DARRIN: I know.

1542
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:30,251
We got it all on tape.
Let's go.

1543
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:33,053
They definitely heard us.
They're gonna seal
that shutter down.

DARRIN: (PANTS)
What the fuck was
that back there?

1545
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:37,692
Think about it.
That was definitely
not from this planet.

1546
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,327
DARRIN: I know. Exactly.

1547
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,979
We have enough footage.
We have to look for an exit.

1548
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,630
REID: We gotta keep going.
This is what we talked about.

1549
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:43,565

too loud, someone's
gonna hear us.

gonna see us.

Yeah.

me what happened?

and then the alarm went off,

1898
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:09,503
and started getting chased.

1899
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:10,604
And, so we split up.

You got inside?
Yeah.
