1
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,781
Hello, Matthew,
what are you doing here so late?

2
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:53,821
I came to get the books.
I want to study our accounts.

3
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,915
We've been doing very well lately.

4
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:58,358
Over 200 paid admissions today.

5
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,760
You call that good Saturday business?

6
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,288
If you weren't so stubborn,
we'd be turning them away from here.

7
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,733
Who cares a hang about history in wax?

8
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:09,328
There are people in the world
who love beauty.

9
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,896
But more who want sensation, shock!

10
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,408
Morbidly curious! I won't cater to them.

11
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,969
Their money is as good as anybody else's.

12
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,278
You should have seen them turning
them away at that Wax Museum...

13
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:24,286
on 23rd Street tonight: the Eden Musée.

14
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:26,982
The story's the same at
Madame Tussaud's in London.

15
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:29,752
-If you'd only listened to me--
-I know, Matthew.

16
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:34,024
I'd put in a Chamber of Horrors:
murder, torture, executions...

17
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:37,498
scare the life out of people.
I don't care for that kind of patronage!

18
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,797
You're a great artist, a genius sculptor.

19
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:43,566
I'm an ordinary businessman who wants
a quick return on his investment.

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,666
I've put $20,000
in this historic peep show of yours.

21
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:50,372
-I could use that to better advantage.
-All right, Matthew.

22
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:54,240
I've known for some time
you wanted to dissolve our partnership.

23
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,945
-I may be able to accommodate you.
-How?

24
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,583
A friend is bringing Sidney Wallace,
the art critic, to see my work tonight.

25
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:06,328
Wallace is rich, and I think
I might persuade him to buy you out.

26
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,397
That sounds interesting.

27
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,395
-I'll want a profit on my investment.
-Yes, Matthew.

28
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,435
I understand.

29
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,901
You leave everything to me,
and I promise you it will be--

30
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:20,605
-That should be they, now.
-I'll wait in the office.

31
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,872
I've heard of Wallace.
He has a pot of money.

32
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,710
If he likes your stuff, put a stiff price on it.

33
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,223
-Does Jarrod live here?
-Yes, he has a room upstairs.

34
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:44,061
You'll like him, Sidney.
He speaks your language.

35
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,663
Please come in.
I'm happy to see you, Bruce.

36
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:50,069
I thought you wouldn't come
on such a bad night.

37
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,573
We were delayed.
He had to be at a gallery.

38
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,610
Mr. Sidney Wallace. Professor Jarrod.

39
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,611
-A pleasure.
-For me also, Professor.

40
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,648
That title was bestowed on me
when I became an exhibitor.

41
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,911
It has little to do with my real work.

42
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:04,681
If you come, I will show you
what that work is.

43
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:07,018
The visit of such a distinguished critic...

44
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,422
may cause my children
to become conceited.

45
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:13,485
To you, they're wax. But to me,
their creator, they live and breathe.

46
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:16,798
Here we have two great lovers
from the past.

47
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:21,595
Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt,
and Mark Antony. Their last meeting.

48
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,832
You'll recall, Antony,
believing Cleopatra to be dead...

49
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,738
killed himself with his own sword.

50
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:30,210
When Cleopatra found out what happened,
she quickly followed her lover.

51
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,180
You noticed how cleverly
the hair is mounted on the scalp?

52
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,876
Yes. How do you do that?

53
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,977
Real hair of the proper color and texture...

54
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:41,251
is pressed into the slightly warmed wax
with a scalpel...

55
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,757
one hair at a time.

56
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:46,192
Each wave and curl
of the subject's own hair is reproduced.

57
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:56,233
Here's President Lincoln and his assassin,
John Wilkes Booth...

58
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:59,035
one of my few concessions
to the macabre.

59
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,209
That's the best figure of Booth I've ever
seen. You almost expect him to speak.

60
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,942
-I wonder what he'd say.
-I'm sure he'd rant a bit.

61
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:10,918
Even after he shot Lincoln and jumped
from the President's box onto the stage...

62
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:14,047
he couldn't resist turning to the audience
and taking a bow.

63
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,250
I found him a very stubborn person.

64
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,724
-Stubborn?
-Unbelievably.

65
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:22,094
For days I argued with this fellow
before he posed the way I wanted him to.

66
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,758
-You mean, he talked back to you?
-Of course.

67
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,663
It's not easy to shut an actor's mouth.

68
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,631
These groups are like
dimensional paintings of the old masters.

69
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,942
This is not only a great show,
it's an art exhibit.

70
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:36,672
That's what I told you.

71
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,409
Here we have Joan of Arc,
a favorite subject of mine.

72
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,510
-I understand that. It's beautifully done.
-Thank you.

73
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,723
I've done her over a dozen times,
and still she doesn't complain.

74
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,951
What was wrong with her?

75
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,256
There are no
authentic portraits available...

76
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,161
so sculptors and painters
have to work from models.

77
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,722
I've never found the right one,
but I will someday.

78
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,032
It's a shame to race through this exhibit.
These figures should be studied.

79
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:05,563
You're very kind.
My creations have some merit, I suspect...

80
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,871
but in bringing back to life
the lovely Marie Antoinette...

81
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,913
I feel I've done my best work.

82
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,315
I've never seen anything so exquisite.

83
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:16,180
People say they can see
my Marie Antoinette breathe...

84
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,311
that her breast rises and falls.

85
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,385
Look at her eyes,
they follow you wherever you go.

86
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,357
She is very real to me.

87
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,152
You know, her eyes do follow you.

88
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,427
They're made of glass, more's the pity.
The exact size and color of the original.

89
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,863
They're inserted into the sockets
from inside...

90
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:37,702
by way of the hollow neck,
before the head is attached to the body.

91
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,469
Forgive me, my dear,
for discussing your intimate secrets.

92
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,574
I'm sorry. I lose myself at times.

93
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:47,881
If people knew what you have
inside these walls...

94
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,316
you couldn't accommodate the crowds.

95
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,082
What you need here is exploitation,
more advertising.

96
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:56,319
-That's what I've been telling him.
-My partner wouldn't agree.

97
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,657
He's not happy here.
He wants to invest in something else.

98
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,496
Would you become a partner
in this venture? Would you buy him out?

99
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:08,563
I might be interested if my
lawyers approve and the price is right.

100
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,505
With your support, I'd do wonders.
I'd make any sacrifice.

101
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,442
Unfortunately, I'm leaving for Egypt.
I'm financing some excavations there.

102
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,979
I'll be back in three months,
then we can discuss--

103
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,776
You make me very happy.

104
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,518
You intrigue me, Professor.
I believe we'd get along together.

105
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,247
-Good night.
-Good night.

106
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,812
-And I'm grateful to you--
-It's all right.

107
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,529
Thank you for your visit
and your encouragement.

108
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,189
I'll see you in three months.

109
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,960
-Good night.
-Good night.

110
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,808
Mr. Wallace is a great art critic, darling.
You heard what he said.

111
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,648
Does he make you happy?

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,689
Of course you'd say that.
But I don't care about success.

113
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:03,247
The world will acknowledge your beauty.

114
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,420
And you, my friends...

115
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:09,055
Cleopatra, Mark Antony,
Lincoln, Joan of Arc, all of you.

116
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,759
How would it suit you to be famous again?

117
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,430
I know it'll please you,
you conceited devil.

118
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,241
It was like you to get yourself shot down
in a burning barn.

119
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,243
Couldn't do it
without a spotlight, could you?

120
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,711
Do you really hear what they say?

121
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,640
Of course.

122
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,982
A man has to be a little nuts
to be a good showman.

123
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,080
The sooner I'm out of it, the better.

124
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,749
You'll be out soon, Matthew.

125
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,226
Mr. Wallace returns from Egypt
in three months.

126
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,263
He'll be ready to talk business then.

127
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,163
-I heard him. That's no good for me.
-But, surely--

128
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:48,169
I want to buy something. It'll pay off
in a big way and three months is too late.

129
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:51,104
What guarantee do I have
that he won't go cold on the deal?

130
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,108
-Sorry. It's the best I could do.
-I can do better.

131
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:57,777
How would you like
to split $25,000 with me?

132
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,474
And you call me crazy?

133
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:02,745
You ever thought of what would happen
if we had a fire here?

134
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:06,015
In the cellar, there are six barrels of wax.
Wax is paraffin based.

135
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:09,615
It's highly inflammable.
This place would go up like a paint factory.

136
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,354
Burn? Burn all my people?

137
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,759
-Do you think I'm a murderer?
-Stop dreaming.

138
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,823
These dummies are insured for $25,000.
That's $12,500 for each of us.

139
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,463
You'd have money to begin again.

140
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,370
I'd rather die myself
than see my friends destroyed.

141
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,965
I won't let you do it,
and I'll kill you if you try.

142
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,510
Don't be stupid.

143
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:32,707
All you have to do is to strike a match
and the thing is done.

144
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,705
Yes, my friend was a genius.
A great artist.

145
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,673
Only I could understand him.

146
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,112
We were like that, Cathy. Just like that.

147
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,086
-Couldn't they ever find him after the fire?
-Not a sign of him.

148
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,819
The place burned like a paint factory.
Like a volcano.

149
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,657
He was such an impractical fellow.

150
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,958
But I still loved him.

151
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,726
Had I been there, I might have saved him.

152
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,429
You might have gotten burned yourself.

153
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,164
Yes. Such is life.

154
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:06,732
No matter how much we lose,
we must still go on living.

155
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,711
Was there any insurance
on the Wax Museum?

156
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,246
Yes. I had a little difficulty about that.

157
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,982
According to the partnership agreement...

158
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,714
the money was to go
to the survivor of the others.

159
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,349
The insurance company
insists upon proof of my partner's death.

160
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,623
They always want a corpse.

161
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,696
But they settled finally.
This afternoon, in fact.

162
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:34,131
Certified check. I got it cashed.
The money is in my safe.

163
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,030
-You know what that means, baby?
-No, what?

164
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:41,069
That little trip
I was talking to you about....

165
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:46,172
You're such a card!

166
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,210
-How much did you get?
-$25,000.

167
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:53,377
Where would you like to go? Atlantic City?

168
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:57,722
Niagara Falls.
We can get the license in Buffalo.

169
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,890
-License?
-Yes. You know.

170
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:03,693
Legitimate.

171
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,192
Why not? It might be fun.

172
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,793
Waiter, my check.

173
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,787
Pull it tighter, Sue.

174
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,625
I want a waist like Anna Held.

175
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,260
If I pull it any tighter,
you're not going to be able to breathe.

176
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:31,100
That's all right.
I don't need much breath, anyway.

177
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:33,968
As my late friend Matty used to say:

178
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,142
"If a girl don't watch her figure,
the men won't."

179
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,871
Wasn't that the man you were to marry?

180
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,348
Yes, but he hung himself instead.

181
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:45,453
Matty was such a card.

182
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,121
Where is your new friend
gonna take you tonight?

183
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,921
The Hoffman House for dinner,
and then to a vaudeville show.

184
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,454
-That sounds like fun.
-He's a free spender, all right.

185
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:58,860
Little bit older than I like 'em,
but very distinguished looking.

186
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,232
-Is he nice?
-Awfully nice.

187
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:04,963
A real gentleman,
except when he has had a couple of drinks.

188
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,837
That's to be expected.

189
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,206
I'm moving up.

190
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:12,443
I'm moving up in the world, honey.

191
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,677
No girl ever hits the jackpot
till after she passes 14th Street.

192
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,015
-Is that how it goes?
-Sure.

193
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:20,747
Look at me.

194
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,620
Not too long ago,
I was down on Delancey Street.

195
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:27,219
And tonight I'll be right up there
among the bright lights on 23rd.

196
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:30,162
Now, when you get up there tonight,
don't drink too much.

197
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:32,029
Don't worry, I won't.

198
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,560
He keeps trying to pour the liquor into me,
but I always manage to keep my head.

199
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:40,096
After all, now that I'm going regular
with a swell...

200
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,466
I got social obligations.

201
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:46,871
You know how it is when a fella....
No, of course you don't know.

202
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,740
You're not like me. You never could be.

203
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:54,986
You got all the brains
and all I've got is what I've got.

204
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:58,223
You know, I'm surprised
you even talk to me.

205
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,693
What nonsense.
You've been so good to me.

206
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:02,223
Why not?

207
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,232
A girl needs a friend
when she is down on her luck.

208
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,268
Holy smoke! Look at the time.
I've got to hurry.

209
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,170
Did you find a job yet?

210
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:13,867
No, but they need a hat-check girl
at the Silver Slipper...

211
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,308
and I've got an appointment
with the manager.

212
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,608
I know that fellow. Watch out for him.

213
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,808
-But why? What's the matter with him?
-Nothing much.

214
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,641
-Long as you know how to duck.
-That kind?

215
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,708
Yes.

216
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,449
-Did you eat today?
-I had everything I needed.

217
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:30,218
To hear you tell it.

218
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:34,852
-Besides, you're behind in your room rent.
-Mrs. Flannigan will wait for me.

219
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,261
Don't count on that.

220
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,822
The old buzzard
almost locked me out once.

221
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:40,959
There.

222
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:44,096
If I don't sizzle him tonight,
I might as well give up.

223
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:48,971
He's picking me up in a hansom cab.
No trolley for him. He is real society.

224
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,678
All I've got is 50 cents.
Buy some dinner with it.

225
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,583
-No, Cathy.
-Come on.

226
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:02,453
My friend will give me some money
tonight and then I'll stake you.

227
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,982
I don't need any mad money.
I never get mad.

228
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:11,023
Good luck tonight at the Silver Slipper.
And don't forget to duck.

229
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,571
Just a moment, Miss Allen.

230
00:24:57,112 --> 00:25:01,071
-What are you coming in so quietly for?
-I didn't want to disturb anybody.

231
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,673
-Did you get the job?
-No.

232
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,151
-Why not?
-I had trouble with the boss.

233
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,645
You'll get your money.

234
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:10,555
Cathy promised to lend me some tonight
when she comes home.

235
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,924
You better get right up there, then.
Because she's home now.

236
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,731
-Couldn't it wait until tomorrow?
-No, it could not.

237
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,291
If you want to sleep in this house tonight,
you get that money.

238
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:25,339
All right, I'll try.

239
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,147
Cathy, it's Sue. Are you there?

240
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:41,773
I tell you, the scream came from up there.

241
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:48,784
Let's look into it.

242
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:46,511
-Usually there's a policeman at the corner.
-That's why I'm blowing the whistle.

243
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:04,954
Cabbie!

244
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:41,351
-What is it, Mother?
-It's Sue.

245
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,317
This is a surprise.
I was just thinking about....

246
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:51,224
-What happened to you, dear?
-What's wrong?

247
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,790
-Wait a minute.
-What happened?

248
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,098
-Wait a minute.
-What is it?

249
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:02,438
Cathy Gray, the girl in my rooming house,
was murdered tonight.

250
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,168
-What?
-I found her.

251
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,583
The man who killed her
was there in the room.

252
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,877
I tried to get away from him.

253
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:17,548
But he followed me into the street.

254
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,857
No, Scott, please don't go out there.

255
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,864
It's all right, darling. Don't be frightened.

256
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,458
It's all right now, dear. You're safe.

257
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,249
-Who found the body?
-One of my roomers. A friend of Cathy's.

258
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,585
-Sue Allen.
-Which one is Miss Allen?

259
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,085
-She isn't here.
-Where is she?

260
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,193
I don't know. We heard her scream.

261
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:56,423
When we went looking for her,
she was gone.

262
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,159
-Are all your roomers in?
-All but Miss Allen.

263
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,662
Lt. Brennan will want a statement
from each one of you.

264
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:05,899
See that nobody leaves the house.

265
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:17,347
When I arrived at the rooming house,
this girl had been dead for several hours.

266
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:20,215
The immediate cause of death
was strangulation.

267
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,949
The mark of a cord is still on her throat.

268
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:26,355
My examination indicated
she'd probably been given a drug.

269
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,722
-You were right.
-What was it?

270
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:32,396
Something to make her sleep.
Veronal, perhaps.

271
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,101
I'll know as soon as we hear
from the laboratory.

272
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,364
How long would it take
for such a drug to work?

273
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:39,963
That would depend upon
how much it was diluted.

274
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,532
It was probably given to her in a drink.

275
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,871
That's how it's usually done.

276
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,747
-Business is slow tonight.
-What?

277
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:51,376
-Three suicides and two murders....
-And a traffic case since 9:00.

278
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,716
The fellow got hit by an automobile.

279
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,655
I didn't think they go fast enough
to hurt anybody.

280
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,818
Give them time.
They're getting better every day.

281
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:15,101
I hope you like it here, honey.
It's the best we've got.

282
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:27,486
-What's the matter with this one?
-You'll get used to that.

283
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:30,080
The embalming fluid makes them jump.

284
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,551
One of the suicides. Just like a woman.

285
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:35,323
They always have to have the last word.

286
00:35:59,507 --> 00:36:01,975
-Why didn't you tell the police?
-She's doing that.

287
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,635
Last night was the time to do it.

288
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:07,442
-She was in no condition to come here.
-This is murder, Mrs. Andrews.

289
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:12,186
The body of Cathy Gray
was stolen from the morgue last night.

290
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,311
No.

291
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,952
Why would anyone
want to take Cathy's body?

292
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:18,287
We are as much in the dark as you are.

293
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:20,990
We had a similar case before.
Matthew Burke.

294
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,188
I read about that.

295
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,823
And Patterson,
a Deputy City Attorney disappeared.

296
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:26,662
We found no trace of him.

297
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,829
We could've laid our hands
on that man that you saw last night.

298
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:35,474
That's the strangest description
I've ever heard.

299
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,273
-No human being can look like that.
-Sure you didn't imagine it?

300
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:41,815
I did see him.
Just as I described him to you.

301
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,817
He was incredible, but very real.

302
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:46,319
Could he be the man
who took Miss Gray to dinner?

303
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,718
That's impossible.

304
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,757
She told me
that he was very good-looking.

305
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,589
That's what the landlady said,
it's a man with gray hair.

306
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:56,926
We have no suspects
fitting your description.

307
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:59,159
If we did,
we'd have him in the crazy house.

308
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,861
Don't leave town. Where can we find you?

309
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:03,801
27 Lafayette Street.

310
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:07,671
-Miss Allen will stay in our home.
-Make sure of that. She's our only witness.

311
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,437
That's all. Thank you.

312
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,838
How do you do?

313
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:43,536
I received a letter giving this address
and signed Professor Jarrod.

314
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:47,547
But I know the Professor's dead.
Can you tell me who wrote this letter?

315
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:50,908
My name is Sidney Wallace.

316
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:17,936
It's so good....

317
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:22,480
Forgive me. Shaking hands with me
is an unpleasant experience.

318
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,610
My hands are no longer hands.
Sit down, please.

319
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:30,245
This is Igor. He's a deaf-mute.
He is one of my assistants.

320
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:34,290
I'm going to open another wax museum
under a different name.

321
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:39,064
-lt startled you, seeing me here?
-I thought you were dead.

322
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:41,363
Jarrod is dead. I am a reincarnation.

323
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:44,529
When I saw your signature,
I thought somebody was fooling me.

324
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,766
I don't understand
how you escaped the fire.

325
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,672
It's a mystery to me, too.

326
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,576
All I can remember is
that I tried to get out of my studio.

327
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:55,240
-I failed at first, but here I am.
-What a frightful experience.

328
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:58,183
Somehow I made my way
to the house of a doctor.

329
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,981
I still have my limbs but
they won't bear the weight of my body.

330
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,857
As for my hands,
they are no use to me now.

331
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,987
As a sculptor, I can't control them.
But they serve for ordinary functions.

332
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,197
-But you're beginning again?
-With the help of my pupils, yes.

333
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,529
I'm rebuilding my exhibition
from the ground up.

334
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,936
I'm going to give the people
what they want:

335
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,202
sensation, horror, shock.

336
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:25,070
Send them out in the streets
to tell their friends...

337
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:27,671
how wonderful it is to be scared to death.

338
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,943
I'll show you one of my subjects.

339
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:35,982
Do you recall the case of Kemmler,
the first man to die in the electric chair?

340
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:39,618
-Yes.
-Igor is working on a model of his head.

341
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,323
He has a strange obsession,
this mute of mine.

342
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:47,290
Every head he models
takes on the shape of his own face.

343
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:51,898
But in this case I humor him,
for he somewhat resembles Kemmler.

344
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:57,233
Crimes of violence
will be reproduced in wax...

345
00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:00,643
and exhibited while they are still fresh
in the public mind.

346
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:02,939
What do you think of my scheme?

347
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,553
It will succeed, commercially,
though it doesn't sound like you.

348
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,650
-Have you turned your back on beauty?
-No.

349
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,851
But I can no longer create it.

350
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:17,526
-I never forgot your Marie Antoinette.
-Nor have l.

351
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,401
She will be the leading lady
of my new exhibition.

352
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:23,198
But I must find her first.

353
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,295
-Find her?
-A model, I mean.

354
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:29,367
Yes, there will be beauty,
for contrast, if nothing else.

355
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:32,237
But each subject must be taken from life.

356
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:36,811
How can I convince my audience
they're alive, if I don't believe it myself?

357
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,419
I have something I think will interest you.

358
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:44,714
You follow Igor down into the basement.

359
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,728
I have to go my own way.

360
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,641
Here we are. Interesting, isn't it?

361
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:13,914
One of my pupils is about to dip a body
into a bath of wax.

362
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,179
-Body?
-Yes.

363
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:17,349
The bodies are constructed separately...

364
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:20,985
to exact specifications,
of reinforced plaster of Paris.

365
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:24,394
This is Leon, another one of my pupils.

366
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:26,296
-Mr. Wallace.
-How do you do?

367
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:30,133
The wax is melted in the cauldron
you see above the vat...

368
00:41:30,204 --> 00:41:32,832
liquefied and brought to a boiling point...

369
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,274
so that it will distribute itself
evenly over the body.

370
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:39,378
The head and hands,
tinted by my own secret process...

371
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:43,075
are attached to the body
after it is covered with its skin of wax.

372
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,512
Now watch.

373
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:18,785
I wondered how it was done.

374
00:42:18,852 --> 00:42:21,787
It's a method of my own.
Crude but adequate.

375
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:29,818
-Have you found a home for your museum?
-This is it, the building upstairs.

376
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:33,633
We'll continue to use the cellar
as the workshop...

377
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:37,694
it's an excellent location, and the building
can be leased at the right price.

378
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:41,363
I have some capital, but I need more.
$30,000, at least.

379
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,141
That's why I've asked you to come here.

380
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,574
-I'll think it over.
-Good.

381
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:48,674
She is about right, now.

382
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:51,775
Leon, drain out the surplus,
and let her cool.

383
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:55,322
Leon, open up number 27.

384
00:42:55,923 --> 00:42:57,515
Come this way, please.

385
00:42:58,425 --> 00:43:01,883
I told you that I intend to exhibit
scenes of violence.

386
00:43:02,062 --> 00:43:04,223
Here is an interesting subject.

387
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:06,630
A mystery they are still talking about.

388
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,332
All right, Leon.

389
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:13,430
I saw his picture in the papers.
This is a remarkable likeness.

390
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,499
-But it can't be a death mask.
-No, it's from memory.

391
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,649
He hanged himself in an elevator shaft.

392
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,014
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
See the House of Wax.

393
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,654
See the Chamber of Horrors.

394
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,920
Here's three lovely ladies right over here.

395
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,361
Would you like to see Little Egypt?

396
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:18,064
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,
Little Egypt, Queen of the Harem...

397
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:21,972
who danced at the Colombian Exposition
in Chicago in 1893.

398
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:25,170
Is she wax, or is she flesh and blood?

399
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,975
See the world in wax, the Hall of Fame.

400
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:29,413
The Chamber Of Horrors.

401
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:32,941
A cultural exhibition
that'll enlighten you, amaze you....

402
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,454
-I think I could do that.
-No, you couldn't.

403
00:44:35,522 --> 00:44:38,013
I could, too, if I took my stays off.

404
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:40,357
Don't do that. Don't talk that way.

405
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,951
Watch it, young lady.

406
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:46,124
Careful, sir. Keep your head down
or I'll tap you on the chin.

407
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,224
Look out.

408
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,838
That's a becoming hat you're wearing.

409
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:55,932
I wonder if I could clip a flower off it.
Hold steady, now. Don't move your head.

410
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:58,409
Or you'll lose the powder off your nose.

411
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:01,810
There is someone with a bag of popcorn.

412
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:04,112
Close your mouth,
it's the bag I'm aiming at.

413
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:06,209
Not your tonsil. Here she comes.

414
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:08,587
Look at that, it's in the bag.

415
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:12,387
See the lovely centers of ancient times,
ladies and gentlemen.

416
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,519
Beauties who died and tortured
out on the block.

417
00:45:15,596 --> 00:45:17,223
Visit our Chamber of Horrors.

418
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,130
And pass the time of day
with notorious murderers...

419
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,260
who killed with the rope,
the knife, and the axe.

420
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:28,066
Thrills, chills, a lot of dirt
for a price within the reach of all.

421
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,174
I hope you don't think I've gone too far
hiring this fellow to bring people in.

422
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:35,272
-He makes it sound like a sideshow.
-Try him for a week or two.

423
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:37,544
Once we're established,
we won't need that sort of thing.

424
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,156
He looks like a real man.

425
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:50,628
You'd be surprised.

426
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:52,665
It's a real man. Sorry.

427
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,092
The historic figures I'm about to show you
will be more interesting...

428
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:01,198
when I tell you that their faces were
molded from the original death masks...

429
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:04,301
now in the possession
of certain European governments.

430
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,345
First, we have Anne Boleyn...

431
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:09,712
second wife of Henry the Vlll,
and the mother of Queen Elizabeth.

432
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:12,775
With the executioner
Henry borrowed from the French king...

433
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,812
so that Anne's head would be cleaved
from her body without too much pain.

434
00:46:16,957 --> 00:46:19,016
He was a thoughtful husband, Henry.

435
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:21,993
It was he who invented
the short cut to divorce.

436
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,431
A very bad pun, I'm afraid.

437
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:27,458
Here is another scene of historic violence.

438
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,732
Charlotte Corday and Marat...

439
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:32,101
one of the leaders
of the French Revolution.

440
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:36,541
The lady found him taking a bath,
and plunged the knife into his heart.

441
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,737
-Quelle femme terrible!
-What a shocking thing.

442
00:46:38,812 --> 00:46:42,111
Yes, wasn't it? The poor man
was dreadfully embarrassed.

443
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,949
The exhibits in this room
will be added to...

444
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:50,819
from time to time
as various crimes are committed.

445
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,155
You'll read about them
in your newspaper...

446
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,094
and see them enacted here
in waxen tableaux.

447
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:57,524
By the way, ladies...

448
00:46:57,598 --> 00:47:01,500
this is how your ancestor
carried his bride across the threshold.

449
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,659
During the French Revolution...

450
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,763
a certain doctor invented
a labor-saving device...

451
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,172
to take the place of a headmen's ax.

452
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:11,536
So successful was this machine...

453
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:14,206
at cutting off the heads
of the French aristocrats...

454
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:16,215
they named it after its creator.

455
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:18,581
Here it is, the bloody guillotine.

456
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,523
I don't think I can stand it.

457
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,316
Pull yourself together.

458
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:30,352
Twelve years ago, the electric chair
was first used in New York state.

459
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,858
Here we have an authentic reproduction...

460
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:37,336
of the execution of William Kemmler
on August 3, in 1890.

461
00:47:37,971 --> 00:47:42,670
Kemmler killed without mercy
and 2,000 volts sent him to a higher court.

462
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,570
The torture of the rack. In this case...

463
00:47:46,647 --> 00:47:50,913
Lady Anne Askew, an English noblewoman
accused of treason...

464
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:52,876
is being put to the question.

465
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,854
Needless to say,
she admitted she was a traitor.

466
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:58,391
Who wouldn't,
under that sort of pressure?

467
00:47:59,026 --> 00:48:01,586
-Is it your corset?
-It's my stomach. It turned over.

468
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,027
Mine turned over, too.

469
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:04,358
Now, my friends...

470
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:08,925
we have that jolly old gentleman
known as the modern Bluebeard.

471
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:12,672
Like his namesake,
he killed not wisely, but too well...

472
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,707
and did away with eight wives.

473
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,909
-Smelling salts, ladies? Help yourself.
-Thank you very much.

474
00:48:26,086 --> 00:48:29,249
Next door to him, we have a mystery
of more recent date.

475
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:31,650
Matthew Burke, the stockbroker.

476
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,653
He was found hanged in the elevator shaft
of the building where he had his offices.

477
00:48:38,131 --> 00:48:40,793
Was it murder or suicide?

478
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:42,928
Only time will tell.

479
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:48,805
"Foul deeds will rise, though all the world
o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."

480
00:48:57,985 --> 00:48:59,077
Thank you.

481
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:02,083
-You like him?
-He looks exactly like my Uncle Rufus.

482
00:49:02,155 --> 00:49:04,919
They ought to have a policeman like this
in the Eden Musée.

483
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:07,017
-Haven't you been there?
-No.

484
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:10,086
From what I see in the papers,
this museum is even better.

485
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:11,653
We'll soon find out.

486
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,470
Meet my good friend, Mr. Sidney Wallace.

487
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,165
-Miss Sue Allen.
-A pleasure.

488
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,868
-I heard you were in town.
-You should have looked me up.

489
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,572
I expect great things of Scott.
He's one of our most promising sculptors.

490
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:29,172
-Has he been working hard?
-He never knows when to stop.

491
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:32,116
-Sue's been posing for me.
-lndeed, lovely subject.

492
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:34,210
She's not a professional model.
She's a guest.

493
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:35,845
Our mothers were great friends.

494
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:38,288
-Have you been inside?
-Is it exciting?

495
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:41,054
If anything, too much so.
But I'm sure it'll catch on.

496
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:43,323
Jarrod, the owner,
is a good friend of mine.

497
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,264
You'll be interested in him.
Let's go in, shall we?

498
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,941
-These figures are excellent.
-I thought you'd agree with me.

499
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:00,736
They're not only well done
but they're good theater.

500
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:03,442
-What do you think?
-I know they are only wax...

501
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:06,748
but they seem so real,
just looking at her makes my neck hurt.

502
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,981
Wait till you see the Chamber of Horrors.

503
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:11,923
I told Jarrod he should have
a nurse on duty there.

504
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:15,424
He lost the use of his hands.

505
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,723
-Who did these figures?
-His pupils, but he supervised the work.

506
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,632
-His is the mastermind.
-Surely knows his anatomy.

507
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,448
Sue, what is it?

508
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:23,893
-Are you crying?
-What's wrong, Miss Allen?

509
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:26,831
A dear friend of mine was murdered
and I found her.

510
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:30,501
She means Cathy Gray, the girl
whose body was stolen from the morgue.

511
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,538
What made you think of her now?

512
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:36,967
That's her face. I know every line of it.

513
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:40,137
I wake up at night and I see it.
I can't get it out of my mind.

514
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:42,807
Perhaps that's the reason
you see a resemblance.

515
00:51:42,883 --> 00:51:45,647
-It's more than a resemblance.
-It's wax, my dear.

516
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,118
I know, but....

517
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,656
But why should it be so like Cathy?

518
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:52,655
I think I can explain that.

519
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,225
-This is a pleasure.
-You see, Miss Allen--

520
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:01,597
I heard what the young lady said.

521
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:05,468
The figure of Joan of Arc
is a traditional exhibit in wax museums.

522
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,531
It was completed just in time
for our opening tonight.

523
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:11,873
You're right, my dear.
It is more than a chance resemblance.

524
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:15,740
When I create an important figure,
I can't take just any face.

525
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:18,749
I saw pictures of your Cathy Gray
in the newspaper.

526
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:21,845
Her face fascinated me. And here she is.

527
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:25,290
Immortalized as the victim
of an earlier event.

528
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:29,786
-Do you really think she'd mind?
-No, I don't think she'd mind.

529
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,899
Cathy loved to "dress up" as she called it.
She used to take fancy dresses...

530
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:37,799
and imitate the actresses
she saw in the theater.

531
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:40,595
-I don't think she'd mind.
-Then I'm forgiven?

532
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:42,608
There's nothing to forgive.

533
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,205
I just don't understand
how it can seem so real.

534
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:50,045
That's the finest compliment
I have ever received. Thank you, my dear.

535
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:52,647
Did I hear your name correctly,
Scott Andrews?

536
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,018
-Yes, Mr. Jarrod.
-The sculptor I've been telling you about.

537
00:52:56,323 --> 00:52:58,587
Sidney showed me
photographs of your work.

538
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,387
He was right. You have great promise.

539
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,623
-What are you doing now?
-I'm doing a head of Miss Allen.

540
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,525
Let me see your hands.

541
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:10,636
Mine were once like that.

542
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,270
How I envy you.

543
00:53:15,976 --> 00:53:20,174
Would you be interested in some modeling
for me, some originals I have in mind?

544
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:21,612
Yes. I'd be honored.

545
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,878
Good. Come here tomorrow morning,
we'll make the arrangements.

546
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,646
I think you'll like it.

547
00:53:28,688 --> 00:53:30,679
I want you to look at this girl.

548
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:33,317
-With pleasure.
-Who does she remind you of?

549
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:35,258
I've been wondering about that.

550
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:37,387
I haven't known her
more than 10 minutes...

551
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,125
but there's something about her face--

552
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,794
That haunts you as the face
of my Marie Antoinette has haunted me.

553
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,272
Of course. I should have seen it at once.

554
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,937
A figure in wax.
Mr. Jarrod's greatest work.

555
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,137
More than wax. She lived.

556
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:55,839
-You mean I look like she did?
-Exactly as she did.

557
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:59,549
Once in his lifetime,
every artist feels the hand of God...

558
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:02,179
and creates something that comes alive.

559
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:05,715
So it was with my Marie Antoinette.
And I loved her.

560
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:09,724
But she is gone now. Horribly destroyed.

561
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:14,490
Perhaps you would help me
to bring her back.

562
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:17,201
You will come to see me? Soon?

563
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:19,602
I'd be glad to.

564
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:23,672
You'll be welcome at any time,
no matter what I'm doing.

565
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,208
-And you, Mr. Andrews, in the morning....
-I'll be here, very eager to begin.

566
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:31,640
It has been a very exciting day for me
and I'm a little tired.

567
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,250
So if you'll forgive me, I'll say good night.

568
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:40,089
-Sidney, one moment, please.
-Excuse me, I'll be right back.

569
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:45,289
Forget about it.
You heard what Mr. Jarrod said.

570
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,528
Cathy's face was inspiration.
It's a portrait in wax.

571
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,432
Why should it seem so real?

572
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,575
I hate to drag you away.

573
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:01,944
That's fine. I'm going to work here.
We'll see it all another time.

574
00:55:02,015 --> 00:55:03,539
Yes, another time.

575
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:07,548
Still time to see the entire exhibition,
ladies and gentlemen.

576
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,750
Get your tickets from the fine little lady
in the box office and go right in.

577
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,189
See the world in wax
and improve your mind.

578
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,026
See the Chamber of Horrors
and scare yourself out of a year's growth.

579
00:55:34,547 --> 00:55:35,980
Not again.

580
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,278
What happened? Why did you scream?

581
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,745
I saw Cathy again.

582
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:18,041
And the man who killed her
was right here in this room.

583
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,843
I must have been dreaming.

584
00:57:21,254 --> 00:57:23,017
Of course you were, dear.

585
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,444
A lager for the gentleman.

586
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,517
Sarsaparilla for the lady.

587
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,289
-And two knockwurst on rye.
-Thank you.

588
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:35,191
-Enjoying yourself?
-It's exciting.

589
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,893
-Do nice people come here?
-Of course.

590
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:41,900
-These Sunday matinees are very popular.
-I don't know.

591
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:46,371
It doesn't seem proper,
all those girls showing their talents.

592
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,607
You never saw a show
like this in Provincetown?

593
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:55,813
Don't worry, your reputation is safe.
You've been worrying too much...

594
00:58:55,882 --> 00:58:58,976
about wax figures
and seeing monsters in your dreams.

595
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:02,851
You need something like this
to bring you back to normalcy.

596
00:59:05,258 --> 00:59:06,247
Prosit!

597
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:40,359
Remember Mr. Jarrod said he first saw
Cathy's picture in the newspaper.

598
00:59:40,426 --> 00:59:42,257
Yes. What's wrong with that?

599
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:44,787
I knew her so well.

600
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,862
I knew every little expression
and they are all there.

601
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:51,096
They would be. The man's an artist.

602
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,970
There's something else I saw
that night in the museum.

603
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:58,602
Cathy had a habit
of wearing an earring in her right ear.

604
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,281
She had the lobe of her right ear only
pierced for that.

605
01:00:03,449 --> 01:00:07,180
But that's there, too.
How could he see that in a photograph?

606
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,513
-How can he make it so real unless....
-What?

607
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:15,223
Unless it is Cathy.

608
01:00:16,629 --> 01:00:19,655
I'm going to take you
to Lt. Brennan's office tomorrow.

609
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:23,600
Tell him exactly what you told me here.
He's a policeman, he knows.

610
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,935
He'll convince you once and for all
that no such thing could happen.

611
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:29,531
Now relax, honey, and enjoy the show.

612
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:07,142
I know it sounds fantastic,
but you asked me to tell you everything.

613
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:11,149
You can see this idea is an obsession,
an unhealthy one, if you ask me.

614
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:14,152
-You say Jarrod is a cripple?
-He uses a wheelchair.

615
01:01:14,554 --> 01:01:17,148
He can walk with crutches,
but not very well.

616
01:01:17,523 --> 01:01:21,186
Such a man came and asked to see
police photographs of Cathy Gray.

617
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,128
That's how it's done. Every detail
is studied to make the features true to life.

618
01:01:25,198 --> 01:01:27,826
But why should Joan of Arc
have her right ear pierced?

619
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,835
-Why not? They wore them then.
-Two, not one.

620
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:35,301
Lieutenant, it's not a suspicion.
It's more a kind of fear, an intuition.

621
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:39,175
Intuition isn't much help in police work.
Facts are what we need.

622
01:01:39,245 --> 01:01:42,612
Suppose you forget about it,
and let us do the worrying.

623
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:44,582
You mean you'll investigate it?

624
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,948
-Of course he does.
-Yes, that's what I mean.

625
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:50,216
-You both think I'm crazy.
-We think nothing of the kind.

626
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,884
It was very good of you to listen
and be so patient. Thank you.

627
01:01:54,394 --> 01:01:55,827
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

628
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:57,256
Thanks.

629
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:06,194
This is Brennan speaking. Give me Shane.

630
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,366
Hello. I want you to go
to the City License Bureau...

631
01:02:09,442 --> 01:02:12,036
and check up
on a man named Henry Jarrod.

632
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:15,547
Yes, he opened a museum
on 29th Street, near Broadway.

633
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:18,677
Yes, The House of Wax.

634
01:02:19,018 --> 01:02:22,886
Dig up all you can. Get a list
of his employees and check with me here.

635
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,839
That's a copy of her face, all right.

636
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:53,442
But she didn't look like that
when I saw her.

637
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,147
-Not so composed.
-Poor kid.

638
01:02:56,389 --> 01:02:58,323
You know, this fellow Jarrod's good.

639
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:02,020
-You think Miss Allen's fears are justified?
-Heck, no. Do you?

640
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,752
That's wax, how could it be anything else?

641
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:07,891
Leave it to a skirt
to dream up a crazy idea like that.

642
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,003
So you did you come to see me,
my Marie Antoinette?

643
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,977
Or was it that you came to see?

644
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:57,345
Mr. Jarrod, I'm so sorry. I know
I'm not supposed to touch the figures.

645
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,146
You couldn't help yourself.
Don't let it trouble you.

646
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:03,052
I beg your pardon,
this is Leon Averill and Igor.

647
01:04:03,122 --> 01:04:07,024
-How do you do?
-Igor isn't impolite. He simply can't talk.

648
01:04:07,326 --> 01:04:09,419
Leon is an artist in his own right.

649
01:04:09,495 --> 01:04:12,896
It was he who did the waxwork
on the figure of Joan of Arc.

650
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:16,162
-Does she still seem real to you?
-As life itself.

651
01:04:16,569 --> 01:04:20,232
Of course, her hair is different,
but that doesn't change her face.

652
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,340
What puzzles me is
how you can get such detail from a photo.

653
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:29,344
Was Cathy wearing her earrings
when the police photographed her?

654
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:32,407
Earrings? I don't remember.
Was she, Leon?

655
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:35,814
No. I don't think so.

656
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:39,085
The police would remove the jewelry
from the body, wouldn't they?

657
01:04:39,158 --> 01:04:43,151
Yet you were careful to show that
both her ears had been pierced for them.

658
01:04:43,529 --> 01:04:45,053
Yes, of course.

659
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:49,090
If I missed a detail of that sort,
Mr. Jarrod would be most displeased.

660
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:51,033
He insists on reality.

661
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,962
I can understand that.

662
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:54,732
Just a moment, Leon.

663
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:58,800
There's something in this box
I think would interest you. Open it, Leon.

664
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:09,177
Your Mr. Andrews permitted us
to make a cast of the head he did of you.

665
01:05:09,255 --> 01:05:12,656
Leon has just finished it in wax.
Do you like it?

666
01:05:13,225 --> 01:05:16,388
It's sort of a shock
to see your head detached that way.

667
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:20,357
-I guess it's a very good likeness.
-Yes, and no.

668
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:23,599
Andrews is clever,
but like all modern sculptors...

669
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:27,105
he has too much imagination.
He would improve on nature.

670
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,006
What I need for my Marie Antoinette
is you.

671
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,473
The real you.

672
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,812
Nothing less will satisfy me.

673
01:05:34,547 --> 01:05:37,243
Will you come to see me again, my dear?

674
01:06:02,675 --> 01:06:06,270
You know this fellow Jarrod's
quicker at finding these guys than we are?

675
01:06:06,345 --> 01:06:09,041
That's what he says in his advertising.

676
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:11,772
Look at that. Even the twist in the neck.

677
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:14,882
That's a case that gets me.
Where is Burke? Who got him?

678
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:17,923
-Who'd want him?
-We better find out pretty quick.

679
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:21,016
-Did you read the blast in today's World?
-Yeah, it's dynamite.

680
01:06:21,093 --> 01:06:23,288
The Chief had me in his office
this morning.

681
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:26,525
If I'm not careful,
I'll be pounding a beat in the Bronx.

682
01:06:37,043 --> 01:06:38,510
Come here, Jim.

683
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:44,480
Do you remember Patterson, the
Deputy City Attorney who disappeared?

684
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,574
Sure.

685
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:48,484
Does Booth look like Wilbur,
or am I crazy?

686
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,446
He does a tad with the brush off his lip.

687
01:06:51,724 --> 01:06:55,319
The hair is different, of course,
but the features are like Patterson's.

688
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:59,455
Maybe he looked like Booth. I've seen
dummies that look like people I know.

689
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:02,460
The caveman is a spitting image
of the new Commissioner.

690
01:07:02,535 --> 01:07:05,470
Please. Don't touch the exhibits.

691
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:07,799
-Can't you read the sign?
-I'm sorry.

692
01:07:07,873 --> 01:07:11,331
Look, where'd you get the face
for this guy that shot Lincoln?

693
01:07:11,677 --> 01:07:14,646
-From photographs.
-They take them at that time?

694
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,338
If you go to the City Library...

695
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:19,976
you'll find the volume of Mathew Brady's
photos taken during the Civil War.

696
01:07:20,052 --> 01:07:21,815
-Do you work here?
-Yeah.

697
01:07:22,088 --> 01:07:24,215
-You make these things?
-Some of them.

698
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,882
What's your name?

699
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:28,520
Leon Averill. What's yours?

700
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:32,553
Jim Shane. I'm an engineer on the
9th Avenue El. It was nice meeting you.

701
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:42,040
You know me. I'm no good at names,
but I don't forget faces.

702
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,900
If I can take the muff off of that one
I might be able to place it.

703
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:47,203
It was a long time ago.

704
01:07:52,284 --> 01:07:55,276
Mr. Wallace, I'm Lt. Brennan. Sgt. Shane.

705
01:07:55,354 --> 01:07:57,788
-Glad to know you.
-Won't you sit down?

706
01:07:57,857 --> 01:08:00,052
-Sorry I kept you waiting.
-That's all right.

707
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:03,459
This is the first time I've been
asked to come to Police Headquarters.

708
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:04,723
What am I suspected of?

709
01:08:04,797 --> 01:08:07,960
Nothing. We thought perhaps
you might be able to help us.

710
01:08:08,134 --> 01:08:10,796
We heard that your partner
is the same Professor Jarrod...

711
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:13,930
whose museum on 24th Street
burned down some time ago.

712
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,200
That's true.

713
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:20,305
This Professor Jarrod was
supposed to have been killed in the fire.

714
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:23,678
-Apparently, a slight mistake.
-You suspect him of some criminal act?

715
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:25,944
-We haven't a thing on him.
-We're curious.

716
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,986
So is the insurance company.

717
01:08:28,788 --> 01:08:30,619
What do you know about his employees?

718
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:34,750
-There's Scott Andrews, a protégé of mine.
-Yes, we know of him.

719
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:39,421
Then there's Igor, deaf-mute,
and Leon Averill, who does the wax work.

720
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:44,660
Averill's an odd character.
Periodical drunkard, but a fine artist.

721
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:48,373
I've seen some of his sketches.
One of the Savior with his disciples.

722
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,839
Beautiful work.

723
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:55,076
-I'm afraid I haven't been much help.
-You never can tell. Thank you.

724
01:08:55,314 --> 01:08:58,340
-Please don't mention this to your partner.
-I won't.

725
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:03,054
You know, I gamble on Jarrod.

726
01:09:03,155 --> 01:09:06,283
He's strange, unpredictable,
but I think he's a man of integrity.

727
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:10,260
-I'm sure of it. Thank you very much.
-Not at all. Good day, gentlemen.

728
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:14,962
Remember I told you
I knew the man with the whiskers?

729
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:18,868
Do you remember that artist in Sing Sing
who painted The Last Supper on his cell?

730
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:22,135
Hendricks. They called him a genius
and gave him a parole.

731
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,768
But when they turned him loose,
he became a drunk.

732
01:09:24,844 --> 01:09:28,143
He broke parole a year ago.
We've had him on the wanted list since.

733
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:31,039
-Carl Hendricks?
-That's him. Alias, Leon Averill.

734
01:09:31,116 --> 01:09:32,981
-Bring him in.
-Can do.

735
01:10:05,251 --> 01:10:07,685
A little more bitterness
in that face, my boy.

736
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:10,517
Remember, this fellow has been
badly used by the world...

737
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:13,183
and he despises all the people in it.

738
01:10:13,259 --> 01:10:16,490
Deepen those lines
around the corner of the mouth.

739
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:18,488
Not too much.

740
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,788
There. That's better.

741
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,225
What I wouldn't give
to have those fingers of yours.

742
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:28,706
-Thank you, Mr. Jarrod.
-I'm sorry I kept you so late tonight, Scott.

743
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:31,867
That's all right.
Miss Allen is meeting me here.

744
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:34,878
It's her birthday.
We're going to celebrate at Chiles'.

745
01:10:34,947 --> 01:10:36,608
Charming creature.

746
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:40,812
I was worried. The shock of finding
that murdered girl gave her strange ideas.

747
01:10:40,886 --> 01:10:41,910
I know.

748
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:45,150
I took her to Lt. Brennan, he set her right.

749
01:10:45,224 --> 01:10:47,556
That's very good now. Excellent.

750
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:50,958
Before you go, would you mind
running over to Metzgers for me?

751
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:53,897
-Metzgers?
-Where they make the artificial flowers.

752
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:57,969
They're doing a background
for this new group. Take a look at it.

753
01:10:58,037 --> 01:11:01,063
You know what I want.
Advise them on the color scheme.

754
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:04,974
I'd go myself,
but it's so hard for me to get about.

755
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:07,842
I know. I'll be glad to do it.
I'll go right now.

756
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:09,574
Thank you very much.

757
01:11:14,086 --> 01:11:16,213
I followed him through his bender.

758
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:20,257
Sometimes, he gets the shakes so bad,
you expect to see his teeth fall off.

759
01:11:20,326 --> 01:11:22,055
-Is this all he had on him?
-Yes.

760
01:11:22,127 --> 01:11:23,287
No money?

761
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:28,361
Gold.

762
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,568
"To Wilbur Patterson....

763
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:41,345
"With affection and admiration.

764
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:44,576
"City Attorney's Office.
December 25, 1900."

765
01:11:52,925 --> 01:11:54,688
Where did you get this?

766
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,956
-I found it.
-Where?

767
01:11:57,162 --> 01:11:58,720
-On the El.
-What line?

768
01:11:59,498 --> 01:12:01,693
-Third Avenue, downtown.
-When?

769
01:12:01,867 --> 01:12:04,267
I don't remember, it was months ago.

770
01:12:04,937 --> 01:12:07,428
-Book him on suspicion of murder.
-No. I found that.

771
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:10,134
I never knew the man who owned it.
I never saw him.

772
01:12:10,209 --> 01:12:11,335
Lock him up.

773
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,846
Please don't put me in a cell. I'm sick.

774
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,548
Can't you see my nerves are all shattered?

775
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,681
Look, please give me one little....

776
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:23,546
Can I have one little drink--

777
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:27,820
You're not going to get anything
until you tell us where you got this watch.

778
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,395
-Take him out.
-Let's go.

779
01:17:36,368 --> 01:17:38,928
You shouldn't have done that, my dear.

780
01:17:40,372 --> 01:17:41,896
It is Cathy.

781
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:44,800
It's Cathy's body under the wax.

782
01:17:45,277 --> 01:17:47,711
I knew it. I knew it all the time.

783
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:17,005
Everything I ever loved
has been taken away from me.

784
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:21,173
Not you, my Marie Antoinette,
for I will give you eternal life.

785
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:53,008
This is where I recreated my Joan of Arc.
It's an interesting process.

786
01:18:53,078 --> 01:18:56,844
If you have patience with me, my dear,
I'll show you how it's done.

787
01:19:15,767 --> 01:19:17,394
I can't stand it.

788
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:36,915
All right.

789
01:19:37,823 --> 01:19:40,291
All right, I'll tell you what I know.

790
01:19:40,826 --> 01:19:43,294
Patterson was killed
because he looked like Booth.

791
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,091
-You killed him.
-No, not l. Jarrod, at the waxworks.

792
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:49,264
His hands were no good.
He had to take subjects from life.

793
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:51,734
-You helped him?
-No, they were already dead.

794
01:19:51,803 --> 01:19:53,270
What about Burke?

795
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,866
He's there, too. In wax.

796
01:19:56,608 --> 01:19:59,304
He was the one
who set fire to the old museum.

797
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:01,838
Jarrod came out of it alive, but insane.

798
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:05,474
-Cathy Gray?
-Joan of Arc. That's Cathy.

799
01:20:06,117 --> 01:20:09,518
She's there with all the rest of them.
The whole place is a morgue.

800
01:20:09,588 --> 01:20:12,455
He'll do the same to Sue Allen,
if he gets his hands on her.

801
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:16,187
You've got to stop him
before he does any more killing.

802
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:43,420
That look of horror spoils your lovely face.

803
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:46,150
What if it should show,
even through the wax?

804
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:37,599
Are you in there?

805
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:46,214
Where's Sue?

806
01:21:48,019 --> 01:21:49,748
Where is she?

807
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:37,394
The end will come quickly, my love.

808
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:40,056
There's a pain beyond pain,
an agony so intense...

809
01:23:40,131 --> 01:23:42,725
it shocks the mind into instant oblivion.

810
01:23:43,234 --> 01:23:45,327
We'll find immortality together...

811
01:23:45,403 --> 01:23:47,928
for they'll remember me through you.

812
01:25:01,112 --> 01:25:03,273
Where's Jarrod?

813
01:25:20,398 --> 01:25:23,026
Andrews, where's Jarrod?

814
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:28,768
In the cellar. He's got Sue.

815
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:31,368
Take care of him.

816
01:27:21,686 --> 01:27:24,018
The People's Exhibit Number One.

817
01:27:24,289 --> 01:27:27,884
You almost lost your head. Would you
care to keep that one as a spare?

818
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:29,392
No, thank you.

819
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:32,759
We'll never forget you and your men.
Thanks to you, we're still alive.

820
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:36,630
But every time I shave,
I can still feel that guillotine blade.

821
01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:39,898
-Please, let's not talk about it anymore.
-Yes, you're right.

822
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:45,138
Mr. Brennan, thank you
for the use of your coat.

823
01:27:46,311 --> 01:27:48,779
-That was nothing.
-lt meant a lot to me.

824
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:51,815
When I found
you weren't dressed too warmly...

825
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,377
I didn't want you to catch a cold.

826
01:27:57,188 --> 01:28:00,214
Goodbye, Mr. Brennan,
and thanks for everything.

827
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:03,587
-Bless you, Mr. Shane.
-Thank you, Miss Allen.

828
01:28:05,496 --> 01:28:08,294
By the time this guy
gets out of Sing Sing...

829
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:11,399
this head will grow a long beard.

830
01:28:25,249 --> 01:28:26,216
