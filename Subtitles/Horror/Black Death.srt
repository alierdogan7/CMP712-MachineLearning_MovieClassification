witches will burn.

175
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,457
There's a village in the north
that burnt 128 witches in one night.

176
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,624
That's 16 an hour for 8 hours.

177
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,999
When the night was through,
they'd killed every woman in the village.

178
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,040
By the end of that week,
the men were shagging pigs.

179
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:30,165
(MOLD) Pestilence isn't trial enough...
Now God has us shagging pigs.

180

181
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,499
No. But I know where it lies.

182
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,165
Hell awaits us. Or so we're told.

183
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,332
If you've not got the stomach for it,
then leave now

184
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,790
and I'll have your share of the bounty.

185
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,915
Where does the Church
believe this pestilence has come from?

186
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,540
I don't believe God
is punishing us, like many do.

187
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,665
I say from France,
where all foul things emerge.

188
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,582
(WOLFSTAN) For once, Swire,
you might not be too far from the truth.

189
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,249
Three summers past we fought
a battle at Crecy in Normandy.

190
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,374
King Edward's Army was dwarfed.

191
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,207
For every 20 of us
there were 100 Frenchmen at least.

192
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,665
And the French, oh, the French...

193
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,249
They could sense victory.
They could smell it.

194
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:29,124
But on that day, for the first time,
our archers used the longbow.

195
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:33,040
Quicker to load, further in flight.

196
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:37,249
Their arrows were useless.
They couldn't reach us.

197
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,624
But ours...
ours were like a dark buzzing cloud.

198
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:48,207
At the day's end, the field was littered
with their dead and dying.

199
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:53,707
Custom, no matter how fierce the battle,
is to use the misericorde.

200
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,457
(DALYWAG)
Misericorde is the 'mercy giver'.

201
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,957
You stab through the armpit, directly
into the heart - quick and painless.

202
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,249
(WOLFSTAN) But on this day,
there was an end to chivalry.

203
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,457
King Edward
ordered every Frenchman left alive

204
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,915
to be killed without mercy.

205
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,540
Arms, heads, legs...

206
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,582

207
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,290

descended into savagery.

208
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,832

that concern the pestilence?

209
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,582

among us that day.

210

she was no witch.

215

The woman was already dead.

216
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,540
Had I freed her, the mob would have
caught her again and burned her.

217
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,749

Osmund's heart turned cold.

705
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,249
That in the shadow of his grief
he found hate.

706
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,082
And that in God's name

707
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:13,999
he took up the sword
and vengeance became his creed.

708
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,374
Can I help you?

709
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,707
Please...

710
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:43,499
Please... Please...

711
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,165
I've done nothing wrong.

712
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:52,332
Please...

713
01:32:57,458 --> 01:33:00,290
You have the wrong woman...

714
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:05,332
I want a confession
and I want her alive.

715
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:15,999
(WOMAN SOBS)

716
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:32,749
Please.

717
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:38,624
- (CRUNCH)
- (WOMAN SCREAMS)

718
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:53,165
Osmund, she won't confess.

719
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:55,540
Are you sure she's a witch?

720
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:04,499
Where is she?

721
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:16,957
(WOLFSTAN) Some say he found the witch
and that he tortured her and burned her.

722
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:23,749
Others say it was never her.

723
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:31,749
It was only her guilt he saw,
in the eyes of the accused.

724
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:51,999
(SHE SCREAMS)

725
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,832
I like to think that he found peace.

726
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:04,165
That he continued
seeing beauty in the world...

727
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,790
.. goodness.
