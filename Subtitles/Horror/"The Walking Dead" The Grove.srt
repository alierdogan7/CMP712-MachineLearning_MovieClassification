00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:04,311
- Hi, Nick!
- They're dead now.

3
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:06,023
No, they're not.
They're just different.

4
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:09,012
You say the person that killed
Karen and David did this?

5
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:10,844
We gotta find them, Rick!

6
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:12,534
And I'm not gonna
sleep until we do.

7
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,925
I killed two people.

8
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,493
They might've lived.
That wasn't your decision to make.

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,920
I won't have you there.

10
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,470
Tyreese!

11
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:22,832
How'd you find us?

12
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:25,950
Look.

13
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,632
Those who arrive, survive.

You can sleep, Lizzie.
I'm okay.

If there's trouble,
I can take Judith.

29
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:20,146
I can help.

30
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:22,582
You really think
you can help me?

31
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,582
I know I can, ma'am.

32
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:33,195
Do you think there'll
be kids there?

33
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:35,497
At Terminus?

34
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,931
If their parents
kept them safe.

35
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:40,268
Like Tyreese kept
all of you safe.

36
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,334
I saved Tyreese.

37
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,801
There were people
shooting at him.

38
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:47,803
I shot them.

39
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:52,106
First a man, then a woman.

40
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:59,180
I didn't mean
to shoot her in the head.

41
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,115
You had to.

42
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,417
You saved Tyreese.

43
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,119
Maybe there'll be kids there,

44
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,957
even if their parents
couldn't keep them safe.

45
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,493
Maybe the kids kept
their parents safe.

46
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,529
Yeah.

47
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,299
Did you have kids?

48
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,235
I did.

49
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,003
A kid.

50
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,940
A daughter.

51
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,607
What was she like?

52
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,509
She was sweet.

53
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,850
She didn't have
a mean bone in her body.

54
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,953
Is that why she isn't here now?

55
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,828
Yeah.

56
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,961
Do you miss her?

57
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:54,033
Every day.

58
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,908
Would you miss me?

59
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,415
I'm not gonna have to miss you.

60
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,284
You're dead on your feet.

61
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:08,787
Go sleep next
to your sister, okay?

62
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,288
But, ma'am, I can help.

63
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,122
I'm gonna need your help
looking after things tomorrow.

64
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,255
Go to sleep, okay?

65
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:25,257
Go.

66
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,862
No.

67
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,998
( grunts )
No.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,933
( Tyreese murmuring )

69

<i>No, no.</i>

70
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:42,269
No, no. No.

71
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,006
Found some.

72
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,811
There you go.
Good job.

73
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:06,929
Ow.

74
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,201
- It hurts, right?
- Oh, yeah. It hurts.

75
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,901
This will fight the infection.

76
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:15,003
Might even bring
down your fever.

77
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,574
What do you think?

78
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,811
Three days out?
Four days?

79
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,444
We haven't seen any of those
maps at the crossings.

80
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,413
I'm not sure.

81
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,551
Lizzie's tough.

82
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:36,987
When it comes to people.

83
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,287
What do you mean?

84
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,392
You haven't seen it?

85
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:45,762
How she's confused
about them, the walkers.

86
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:48,230
She doesn't see what they are.

87
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:50,500
She thinks
they're just different.

88
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,510
Tyreese:
<i>Mica the same way?</i>

89
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:02,545
No, she's worse.

90
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,885
She doesn't have
a mean bone in her body.

91
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,557
Mica: Did "Tom Sawyer"
have a happy ending?

92
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,058
We never got to finish it.

93
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,898
Well, Tom and Huck,

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,565
they stop Injun Joe
and his partner

95
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,500
and wind up
getting all his gold.

96
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,902
- So they wind up rich?
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,169
And the Widow Douglas
adopts Huck.

98
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:27,870
Like you adopted us?

99
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,840
Yeah, just like
the Widow Douglas.

100
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:33,240
And I'm Huck Finn.

101
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:36,108
I think you're more
like Tom Sawyer.

102
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,411
Yeah, you're right.

103
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:40,348
You're way more like Huck Finn.

104
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,185
You're not even grossed out
by dead rabbits.

105
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,620
Forgot you used
to read to them.

106
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,727
I did.

107
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:59,208
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,610
There's a fire somewhere.

109
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:04,448
Must be a big one. It isn't
anywhere around here.

110
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,919
We should stop here.
We need to look for water.

111
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:12,056
I can do it.

112
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,027
No, you need to rest.
Rest your arm.

113
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,894
Mica will help me.

114
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:27,341
I spy trees and weeds.

115
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,441
Your turn.

116
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,152
Here.
You stay here.

117
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,557
( snarling )

118
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:30,083
Tyreese.

119
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,227
Sometimes we have to kill them.

120
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,361
I know that.
But sometimes we don't.

121
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:40,866
( Judith crying )

122
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:44,205
( growling )

123
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,607
You know Lizzie can carry
a lot more than me.

124
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:50,714
I had you come because
I wanted to talk to you.

125
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:52,183
Why?

126
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:54,082
Because you're little
and you're sweet

127
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,750
and those are two things
that can get you killed.

128
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:59,120
You can't change
how big you are...

129
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,022
I wish I could.

130
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,657
...but you can
toughen up.

131
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,159
I don't have to be tough.

132
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,826
I can run.
I'm good at that.

133
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:10,129
No.

134
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:14,270
My daughter ran
and it wasn't enough.

135
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:19,409
That's why I taught the kids at
the prison to do more than that.

136
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,779
I can kill walkers.

137
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,746
I mean, I've tried.

138
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:28,287
I'm not like my sister.
I'm not messed up.

139
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:30,755
I know what they are.

140
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:33,124
But I can't kill people.

141
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,728
I could never do that.

142
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:39,632
When the bad people
were at the prison,

143
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,633
they were right in front of us

144
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:44,304
and I held up my gun,

145
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:46,540
but I couldn't
pull the trigger.

146
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,909
Killing people is wrong.

147
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:52,277
Someone killed Karen and David.

148
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,214
They just killed them.
They were nice.

149
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,183
What about people
who try to kill you?

150
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:00,119
I don't even wish I could.

151
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:07,122
People came in
and killed our friends.

152
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:10,295
And I feel sorry for them.

153
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,663
Why?

154
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:16,267
Because they probably
weren't like that before.

155
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:18,736
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to do it.

156
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:21,104
You'll have to do it
or you'll die.

157
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,442
So you're gonna change
the way you think about it.

158
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:25,745
You have to change.
Everyone does now.

159
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:27,647
Things don't just work out.

160
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,347
Look.

161
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:44,430
My mom used to say everything works
out the way it's supposed to.

162
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,085
Mica:
What are these?

163
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:03,520
- Carol: Pecans.
- Oh, I love pecans.

164
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:06,058
You know, maybe we could catch
our breath here for a while.

165
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:13,032
We're still going
to Terminus, right?

166
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,770
We'll just stay a day or two.

167
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:17,807
There's a well full of water.

168
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,476
Fences.

169
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,010
They're not big,
but they're something.

170
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,745
And we saw deer.
They eat pecans.

171
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,380
We should be able
to kill one to eat.

172
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,214
We can eat these, too, right?

173
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:27,682
You can eat your fill
and then some.

174
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:28,750
Look.

175
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,795
Bet that's what
we were smelling.

176
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,395
Looks far enough away.

177
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,766
I wonder how it started.

178
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:41,701
Maybe lightning.
Maybe a campfire.

179
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:43,402
I can patch that fence.

180
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,305
It's probably where
the deer are coming from.

181
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:49,144
We should leave it. Just
play it really safe in here.

183
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,852
If there's one in there,
it's not moving much.

184
00:11:56,854 --> 00:12:00,120
Let's just stay close,
go slow room to room.

185
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:02,122
Girls, you sit tight.

186
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:05,257
<i>You don't come in until we come
out no matter what you hear.</i>

187
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,757
- Okay.
- Okay.

188
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,492
Lizzie's got Judith.
Mica, get out your gun.

189
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,494
You're gonna need
to stand watch.

190
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,432
Stand strong, little lady.

191
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,044
They're gonna be okay.

192
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,978
It's not that.

193
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:38,283
Is it that there was a baby?

194
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,954
No.

195
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:44,723
They're gonna find one in
there and they're going--

196
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:46,422
Stop it.
They aren't people.

197
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:49,592
But you're wrong.
All of you.

198
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:52,093
They aren't people, Lizzie.
They're just dead.

204
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,455
- Are you okay?
- ( hyperventilating )

205
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:18,926
All right, come on.
Come on.

206
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,563
Tyreese: Come on, come on.
I got you, little girl.

207
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,298
- Come on. Come here.
- Got her? Mica.

208
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
Mica, lower the gun.

209
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:28,602
You did it.
You saved them.

210
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,441
Why are you upset, Lizzie?
Were you scared?

211
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,575
No.

212
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:38,412
Then why are you crying?

213
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:40,649
I don't want to say.

214
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:45,286

Tyreese:<i> Shh.</i>

216
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:54,027
Lizzie.

217
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:56,765
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

218
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:00,366
Just look at the flowers
like you're supposed to.

219
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,101
<i>Count one, two, three.</i>

220
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:04,000
<i>Come on, let's count together.</i>

221
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:05,801
Look at the pink ones
over there. You see?

222
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,301
Both:
One, two, three.

223
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,269

224
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,811
You still upset?

225
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,916
Sometimes I don't understand,

226
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:26,951
but I'm trying to, ma'am.

227
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,855
I am.

228
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,928
Look what I found.

229
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,832
I'm gonna name her
Griselda Gunderson.

230
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:40,971
Well, we got plenty of water.

231
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:44,207
Now all we got to do is bag one
of them deer and we're all set.

232
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,640
- Then we'll get one.
- Yeah.

233
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,685
- What's wrong?
- I'm not used to this.

234
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,354
Used to what?

235
00:14:56,356 --> 00:15:00,060
We're in a living room
in a house.

236
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:04,463
Yeah, so relax.

237
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,715
We should live here.

- No, no, no!

- Right now, Lizzie.
- No, no, no, no, no.

- No, no, no, no.

No! No!

248
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:27,142
She was playing with me.
She wanted a friend.

249
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:28,644
She wanted to kill you.

250
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:31,483
- I was gonna lead her away.
- You could have died.

251
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:33,619
It's the same thing!
You killed her!

252
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:36,356
- You killed her! It's the same thing!
- Lizzie.

253
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:41,026
- What if I killed you?!
What if I killed you?! - Lizzie.

254
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:43,329
- You don't understand.
You don't understand. - Lizzie.

255
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:46,635
You don't understand. You don't understand.
You don't understand!

256
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:48,905
Lizzie. Lizzie.

257
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,207
( gasps )
You didn't have to.

258
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,276
You didn't have to.
She didn't want to hurt any...

( kettle whistling )

260
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:58,846
She didn't want
to hurt anybody!

261
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:01,180
She was my friend
and you killed her!

<i>You killed her!</i>

263
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,848
You killed her!

00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,754
She was my friend.

Is it too heavy?

267
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:29,937
Nah, I'm good.

268
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,339

270
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,541
Nope.
The smoke's black.

271
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:42,377
If it was white, the fire
wouldn't be burning anymore.

272
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,214
I miss science class.

273
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,520
Except for when
we had to do stuff like

274
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,491
cut up planaria worms.

275
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,558
You've got to do worse
than that nowadays, Mica.

276
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,527
- I don't gotta.
- You do.

277
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,329
Lizzie's bigger than you and
in some ways she's stronger.

278
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,797
But you're smarter

279
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,800
and you understand
these... things.

280
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,736
You've got to look out for her.

281
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:10,337
You have to--

282
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,074
No, go ahead.
You do it.

283
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,307
Just like I showed you at the prison.
Go ahead.

284
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,438
I can't.

285
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,950
We have peaches.

286
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,545
Maybe we don't need
to go to Terminus.

287
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,553
I've been thinking.

288
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:22,857
Mica's right.

289
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:24,757
We can stay here.

290
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,192
We can live here.

291
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,166
I know Lizzie and Mica.

292
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,804
I know Judith.

00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,939
I know you.

294
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:41,140
I trust you.

295
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:43,608
And I don't know if I can
get that anywhere else.

296
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,580
We could stay.

297
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:50,181
We can live here.

298
00:19:58,356 --> 00:20:00,324

we were just pretending
things weren't bad.

307
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,671
Things are bad.

308
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:40,739
Those things, they're bad.
They are.

309
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,342
<i>We can't pretend anymore.</i>

310
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,917
I'm not pretending.
You were.

311
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,455
I know.
I can hear them.

312
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,456
( growling )

313
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,368
They want to kill you.

314
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,103
They just want me to change.

315
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,839
They can make me be like them.

316
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,241
Maybe I should change.

I know what I have to do now.

337
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:09,668
I know.

338
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:14,240
It's ugly and it's scary

339
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,442

340
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:21,410
That's how we get to be here.

341
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:24,247
That's the cost.

to hurt anyone.</i>

But just sometimes.

No. No.

347
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,673
Now we have a lot
of pecans here.

348
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:50,342
A ton.

349
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,711
- You getting sick of them yet?
- Nope.

351
00:23:57,554 --> 00:24:00,289
I used to make these with my
grandma when I was little.

352
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,293
They smell good.

353
00:24:03,796 --> 00:24:05,698
There you go.
All right.

354
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,769
I think you guys are ready to start
doing the cooking around here.

355
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,873
Who wants to put 'em in?

356
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,311
Me.

357
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:19,307
The girls like it here.

358
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,874
We could build it up,
plant more food.

359
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:24,945
We could find a car for an
escape route just in case.

360
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:32,553
If you don't want to go to
Terminus, we could stay.

361
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:38,259
We could.

362
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,563
It doesn't mean
we can't go someday.

363
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,331
It's just...

364
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,934
when we were getting
closer and closer,

365
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:55,237
I realized

366
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm just not ready to be
around other people yet.

367
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:00,643
You don't have to.

368
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,624
I dream about Karen.

369
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,961
I see her every night.

370
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,999
And every time
I forget she's dead.

371
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:28,174
Sometimes...

372
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,479
we just talk.

373
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,279
And sometimes

374
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,380
I see her in the crowd...

375
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:44,654
in a city I've never been to.

376
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:49,027
And it's back before
everything happened.

377
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,904
And then...

378
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:01,704
<i>some nights, the bad ones...</i>

379
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:06,010
I see someone kill her.

380
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:13,415
Some stranger.

381
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:20,918
Then I lose her all over again.

382
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,829
But that's the deal, right?

383
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:33,526
The people who are living
are haunted by the dead.

384
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,329
We are who we are.

385
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,831
And we do what we do

386
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,267
'cause they're still here.

387
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,169
In our heads.

388
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,139
In the forest.

389
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:52,810
The whole world is haunted now.

390
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:57,147
And there's no
getting out of that.

391
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,618
Not until we're dead.

392
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,189
Tyreese.

393
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,771
Maybe they're not haunting us.

394
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:28,911
Maybe they're just teaching us.

395
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,286
Helping remind us so--

396
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:38,590
so that we can live
with what we have to do.

397
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,201
Hey.

398
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,703
Don't you ever be ashamed
of who you are, Carol.

399
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:58,342
You did right by those girls.

400
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,542
You did right by everyone.

401
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:18,390
We'll get one yet.

402
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:20,726
Probably not even deer season.

403
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,427
My husband used to hunt.

404
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,097
He'd tell the same
stupid joke every year.

405
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,633
You gonna tell it?

406
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:36,002
Well, I guess
I have to now, right?

407
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,906
You do.

408
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:40,240
Okay.

409
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:44,147
What's the difference between
beer nuts and deer nuts?

410
00:28:46,284 --> 00:28:49,653
Beer nuts
are around 1.79,

411
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:51,889
deer nuts are just
under a buck.

412
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:55,159
( laughs )
That's good stupid,

413
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,595
but in no way
is it stupid good.

414
00:28:57,597 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah, I told you.
There's more where that came from.

415
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:15,484
Don't worry.
She'll come back.

416
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,286
I didn't hurt her brain.

417
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:44,181
No, no, no!
We have to wait.

418
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,748
I need to show you.
You'll see.

419
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,719
You'll finally get it.
We have to wait.

420
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,556
Lizzie, put the gun down.

421
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,958
I just want us to wait.

422
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,227
We can wait.

423
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,162
We can wait.
You just give me the gun.

424
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:04,364
We can wait, I swear.

425
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:17,313
You and Tyreese
should take Judith back.

426
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,614
It's not safe for her.

427
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:22,051
But Judith can change, too.

428
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,154
- I was just about to--
- She can't even walk yet.

429
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,991
Yeah, you're right.

430
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,699
So you two take Judith
back to the house

431
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,170
and we'll have lunch.

432
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:41,140
And I'll just tie Mica up.

433
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:43,474
You know, just so
she won't go anywhere.

434
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:46,078
Promise that's what you'll do?

435
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,281
Mm-hmm.

436
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:50,450
I promise.

437
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:53,016
I'll use her shoelaces.

438
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:06,365
<i>( Judith crying )</i>

439
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:16,744
Let's--
let's go, Lizzie.

440
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:37,292
( crying )

441
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:58,572
I brought her some food.

442
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,776
Cleared out her room.

443
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:05,984
Made sure she didn't
have any knives,

444
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,017
anything like that.

445
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,124
She has a shoe box
full of mice.

446
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:23,735
<i>I asked her if she was the one
feeding the walkers at the prison.</i>

447
00:32:25,504 --> 00:32:27,371
<i>That was her.</i>

448
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:34,117
And at the tombs,

449
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,987
we found this rabbit

450
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,359
pulled apart and nailed
to a board.

451
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:44,034
That was her, too.

452
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:47,770
Said she was just having fun.

453
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:55,475
I was thinking,

454
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:59,240
maybe she killed
Karen and David.

455
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,379
But I don't know how
she could drag them away.

456
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,751
She would have let them turn.

457
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:08,753
It wasn't her.

458
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,532
So what do we do?

459
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:20,136
I could leave with her.

460
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:21,704
What?

461
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,377
We can't sleep with her and
Judith under the same roof.

462
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,247
You wouldn't make it.
Not on your own.

463
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,486
She can't be around
other people.

464
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:36,687
Maybe we could try to help her.

465
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:39,055
Talk her back somehow.

466
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:41,424
This is how she is.

467
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:45,629
It was already there.

468
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:49,534
I didn't see it.

469
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:52,270
- How could you?
- I should have seen it.

470
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,812
So maybe we go.

471
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:01,782
Me and Judith.

472
00:34:01,784 --> 00:34:03,752
You won't make it either.

473
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,964
She can't be around
other people.

474
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,261
You should pick
some wildflowers for Mica

475
00:34:39,263 --> 00:34:41,863
to give her
when she comes back.

476
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:44,167
Yeah, she'd love that.

477
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:54,348
The fire's still burning.

478
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,618
No.

479
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,417
The smoke's white.

480
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:00,187
It's out.

481
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:04,226
You know everything, ma'am.

482
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,762
No, I don't.

483
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:10,266
What is it?

484
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:14,002
What is it?

485
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,642
Are you mad at me?

486
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:21,678
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

487
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:27,387
I'm sorry I pointed
my gun at you.

488
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:29,788
I just needed you to wait.

489
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,089
I know.

490
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,957
I'm sorry.

491
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:40,924
You're mad at me.

492
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:45,756
I love you, Lizzie.

493
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:49,061
( crying )

494
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,264
And everything works out
the way it's supposed to.

495
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,934
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:58,371
Please don't be mad at me.

497
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,641
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:00,643 --> 00:36:03,844
You just-- just look
at the flowers, Lizzie.

499
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:06,445
( crying )

500
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:12,519
Just look at the flowers.

501
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:23,397
Just-- just look
at the flowers.

502
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:37,482
- ( gunshot )
- ( body thuds )

503
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:27,251
I killed Karen and David.

504
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:34,526
<i>I had to stop the illness</i>
<i>from breaking out.</i>

505
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:36,995
I had to stop
other people from dying.

506
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,701
It wasn't Lizzie.

507
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,674
It wasn't a stranger.

508
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,445
Tyreese, it was me.

509
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,389
You do what you have to do.

510
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:24,040
Did she know
what was happening?

511
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:28,677
Was she scared?

512
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,117
It was quick?

513
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,389
Yes.

514
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,435
Do what you have to do.

515
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:27,889
I forgive you.

516
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,665
<i>I'm never gonna forget.</i>

517
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,799
It happened.

518
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:40,369
You did it.

519
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,004
You feel it.

520
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:45,307
I know you do.

521
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,644
It's a part of you now.

522
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,315
Me, too.

523
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,254
But I forgive you.

524
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,165
Thank you.

525
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:17,033
We don't need to stay.

526
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,241
We can't stay.

527
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:53,011
Lizzie's voice:
<i>I'm not afraid to kill.</i>

528
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,549
<i>I'm just afraid.</i>

529
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,421
Carol's voice:
<i>You can't be.</i>

530
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:01,689
Lizzie's voice:
How?

531
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:04,127
Carol's voice:
<i>You fight...</i>

532
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:06,129
<i>and fight it.</i>

533
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:09,200
<i>You don't give up.</i>

534
00:42:10,604 --> 00:42:13,103
<i>And then one day,</i>

535
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:16,104
<i>you just change.</i>

536
00:42:20,346 --> 00:42:22,714
<i>We all change.</i>
