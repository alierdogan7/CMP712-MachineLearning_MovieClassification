1
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:11,094
EYES WITHOUT A FACE

2
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,029
The professor?

3
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,195
No, not yet.

4
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,542
I'll tell him, once he's finished.

5
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,615
Is not the greatest
of man's new hopes

6
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,345
that of physical rejuvenation?

7
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,420
This hope

8
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,024
comes with the heterograft.

9
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,921
But the heterograft -
in other words, the transplanting

10
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:42,227
of living tissue or organs
from one human being to another -

11
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,302
has only been possible until now

12
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,405
when both subjects in question

13
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,465
were perfectly identical
from a biological standpoint.

14
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,479
This means biologically modifying

15
00:06:55,648 --> 00:07:00,312
the nature of the host organism.

16
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,046
One method involves using

17
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,751
heavy X-ray irradiation

18
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:13,388
to destroy the antibodies that create
resistance to the heterograft.

19
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,097
Unfortunately, this irradiation
requires such a high level of intensity

20
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,903
that no human being can survive it.

21
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,074
So we resort to exsanguination.

22
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,583
We drain evevy last drop of blood

23
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,481
from the subject
exposed to radiation.

24
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,856
- You just had a call, Professor.
- From whom?

25
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,263
The medico-legal -
You know, the morgue.

26
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,527
They want to see you right away.
- Oh, Professor,

27
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,606
your lecture was so invigorating.

28
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,800
Thrilling, wasn't it, Carlo?

29
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,377
What a wonderful future
you've shown us.

30
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,778
The future, madame, is something
we should have started on long ago.

31
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,351
He's changed so much
since his daughter vanished.

32
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,429
He says such strange things.

33
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,074
It's a strange business,
but that's how it looks to me.

34
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,078
When Génessier's daughter
vanished from the clinic,

35
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,217
her face was an open wound.

36
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:42,616
True, the missing facial tissue
confirms your theovy.

37
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,956
The car accident,

38
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,925
the facial burns,
the long immersion in the river.

39
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,997
And the rats, Doctor.
Don't forget the rats.

40
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,393
True.

41
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,599
Still, the drowning victim's description
also fits that of Simone Tessot.

42
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,333
I called the Tessot girl's father down.

43
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,671
Something doesn't quite make sense.

44
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,250
What's odd is the body was fished out
naked... in a man's coat.

45
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,420
Why should Génessier's daughter,

46
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,558
distraught at her disfigurement,

47
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,089
feel the need to strip naked

48
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,788
in mid-winter
before drowning herself?

49
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,467
And that large open wound
where the face should be -

50
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,002
it's strange.

51
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:39,406
The edges are as smooth as if
someone had taken a scalpel to them.

52
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,179
Here he is.

53
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,878
Dr. Lherminier.

54
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,948
Detective Parot,
of the Missing Persons Bureau.

55
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,387
I'm so sorvy we had to meet
under such unfortunate circumstances.

56
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,227
Let's hear it.

57
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,665
This morning, bargemen fished
a girl's body out of the Seine.

58
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,371
The time of drowning coincides

59
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,305
with that of your daughter's
disappearance.

60
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,970
The description also fits.

61
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,049
The damaged face...
Only the eyes are intact.

62
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,595
IDENTlFlCATlON ROOM

63
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,781
It's her.

64
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,021
Christiane.

65
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,064
Mr. Tessot is here, Doctor.

66
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:53,168
Tell him she's been identified
beyond a doubt. It's not his daughter.

67
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,579
I called him in, in case...

68
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,278
Of course.

69
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,223
Excuse me, Professor.
I'm Henri Tessot.

70
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,892
I'm also here about my daughter.

71
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,630
The custodian said she was yours.

72
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,765
Are you really sure, sir?
Are you vevy sure?

73
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,936
Sadly, sir, only too sure.

74
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,008
It was such a shock when they phoned.

75
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,049
I thought I'd go mad.

76
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,781
It's been 1 0 days
since we last saw Simone.

77
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,517
Something must have happened to her.

78
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,327
How odd I should have to comfort you.

79
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,559
You still have some hope, at least.

80
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,239
She's looking for a room.

81
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,433
With age, he looks
more and more like his father.

82
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:35,006
Remember Génessier, the attorney?
No beanpole, either.

83
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,133
He sure has had a string of bad luck.

84
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,371
Losing his wife four years ago...
now his daughter.

85
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,748
Paris, fame, fortune -
what's it all add up to?

86
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,199
Who's the young man?

87
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,429
The girl's fiancé.

88
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,041
A doctor.
He works with the professor.

89
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,608
And the woman?

90
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,143
His secretavy, it seems.

91
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,146
A foreigner.

92
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,545
She looks deeply affected.

93
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,017
Go home, son.

94
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,143
No, let's go.

95
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,870
I like order.

96
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,094
Let's go!
I can't take any more of this.

97
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,540
Shut up!

98
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,713
TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER

99
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,730
DR. GÉNESSlER'S VlLLA

100
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,461
NO ADMlTTANCE BEYOND THlS POlNT

101
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,809
Where did you find this?

102
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,207
I don't like your snooping around.

103
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,116
I have no time to explain it
to you just now.

104
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,184
Sure, you see your name
with a black border around it.

105
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,022
What can you possibly be imagining?

106
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,532
I don't have to imagine a thing.

107
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:46,330
I see horrible things.
I'm living them!

108
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,496
What have you done now?

109
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,608
What had to be done.

110
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,105
For your own good.

111
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,446
Always for your good, Christiane.

112
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,613
An obituavy notice.

113
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,886
Names were simply substituted.

114
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,093
Since that girl died
after the operation,

115
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,427
I took an additional risk.

116
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,201
I made evevyone believe it was you.

117
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:29,038
Evevyone thinks you're dead.
They won't look any further.

118
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,376
They won't come around
asking what happened.

119
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,750
Christiane, your mask!

120
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,155
Get into the habit of wearing it.

121
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,491
Where did you hide it?

122
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,598
The habit...

123
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,093
I only meant
the habit of wearing it

124
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,000
until we succeed.

125
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,834
Please don't cvy, darling.

126
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,343
I'll succeed, I promise you.

127
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,011
I don't believe it anymore.

128
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,927
There's no reason for you
to doubt me.

129
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,272
I know my abilities, don't l?

130
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,773
You'll have a real face.

131
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,605
I promise you.

132
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,215
They've removed all the mirrors.

133
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,791
but I can see
my reflection in the glass

134
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,258
when the windows are open.

135
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,523
There are lots of shiny surfaces...

136
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,028
a knife blade,

137
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,460
varnished wood...

138
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,197
My face frightens me.

139
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,773
My mask frightens me even more.

140
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,502
Have faith, Christiane.

141
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,171
Look at me.

142
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,043
Didn't he succeed with me?

143
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,048
But you had a face.

144
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:18,783
Damaged, maybe,
but not destroyed like mine.

145
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,484
He's lying to me,
because he knows it was his fault.

146
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,219
His fault?

147
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,729
It was a car wreck.
It was an accident.

148
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:32,233
Accident? He has to control evevyone,
even on the road!

149
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,964
He drove like a lunatic.

150
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:43,146
The crash nearly killed me.
Why did he tvy so hard to save me?

151
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,645
I wish I were blind.

152
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,615
Or dead.

153
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,695
Who is this?

154
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,001
Say something!

155
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,845
I see you're alone, miss.

156
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,921
I have an extra ticket.

157
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,650
My friend didn't show up.

158
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,190
I'd be delighted, madame,

159
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,422
but I planned to buy
an inexpensive seat.

160
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,090
Don't worvy.
I'm not asking you to pay.

161
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,066
Sorvy I'm late.
My class ran overtime.

162
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,036
It's all right.

163
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,769
I was so anxious
to give you the good news.

164
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,709
I found you a room.

165
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,918
I can't believe it! I'm so glad.

166
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,484
How can I ever thank you?

167
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,657
First take a look at the room.
I think you'll like it.

168
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,657
What neighborhood?

169
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,887
A lovely neighborhood.

170
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,957
The same for the young lady.

171
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll drive you there.
The owners are friends.

172
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,701
It's surrounded by trees.

173
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,051
It seems vevy far.

174
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,425
I took the long way.

175
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,167
The traffic's heavy
at this time of day.

176
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,309
That's the train
that will take you to Paris.

177
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,419
In less than 20 minutes.

178
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:08,389
Don't you feel lonely,
so far from your family?

179
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,790
A little, sometimes.

180
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,833
Those dogs...

181
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,335
How many are there?

182
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,073
You see?
You'll be well protected.

183
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,763
Miss Edna Grüberg.

184
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,805
Mr. Dormeuil.

185
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,739
Delighted.

186
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,606
Some port
to refresh you after the drive?

187
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,343
No, thank you, sir.
I don't want to stay too long.

188
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,179
Come now, there's no hurvy.

189
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,825
I'll show you your room.

190
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,832
It looks out over the trees.

191
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,696
I'm sure you'll like it.

192
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,599
I don't know.
I have to think it over.

193
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,669
First, you really must see the room.

194
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,685
Of course, at night
it's hard to judge.

195
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:50,980
It's not that,

196
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,087
but the suburbs
aren't vevy convenient for me.

197
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,418
What do you mean?

198
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,497
The suburbs are vevy convenient.
Vevy convenient.

199
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,066
Maybe so, but...

200
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,431
I don't want to get back
to Paris too late tonight.

201
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:14,168
I'm meeting a friend.
I'll let you know tomorrow.

202
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:18,509
Tomorrow will be too late, my dear.

203
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,149
Open up, quickly.

204
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,303
I'll start after dinner.

205
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,038
This time...

206
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,709
I must tvy removing
a larger section.

207
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,317
In one piece.

208
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,657
Not in sections.

209
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:31,906
Pencil.

210
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,180
Scalpel.

211
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,703
Wipe my brow.

212
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,249
Pencil.

213
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,100
Scalpel.

214
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,528
Forceps.

215
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,764
Here we go.

216
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,654
People are all the same.

217
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,058
They love pets
when they're young.

218
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,786
When their pets grow up
and eat too much,

219
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,691
they abandon them in the woods.

220
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,594
I say you should never
do things halfway.

221
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:06,601
Especially since the second half
is by far the easiest part.

222
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,670
Calm down!

223
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,955
Shut up!

224
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,279
Did she eat normally?

225
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,181
Yes, vevy well.

226
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,652
She'd been wasting away.

227
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,223
She's happy this time.
She has faith.

228
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,051
Finally.

229
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,561
I showed her how nicely it's healing.

230
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,360
I changed the bandages.
It looks fine.

231
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,093
Much better than yesterday.

232
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,033
I'm so afraid.

233
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,139
Don't be.

234
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,741
I have faith this time too.

235
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,839
All I can do is hope.

236
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,246
If this were a success... God!

237
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,150
You couldn't put a price on it.

238
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,588
I've done so much wrong
to perform this miracle.

239
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,388
I've done you
a lot of wrong, too.

240
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:13,366
I know, but I'll never forget
that I owe you my face.

241
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,405
I sometimes forget that myself.

242
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,008
With good reason.

243
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,737
There's hardly any trace now.

244
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,317
What have you decided about Edna?

245
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,919
Look after her. Feed her.

246
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,587
I'll decide later.

247
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,178
Edna! She's escaped!

248
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,279
That way.

249
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,965
No other details that come to mind?

250
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,536
Well, no.

251
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,866
Yes!

252
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:03,535
Edna said the woman
always wore a thick pearl necklace.

253
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,711
See what I mean?

254
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,613
She wore it high around her neck,
like a choker.

255
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,120
That doesn't help us much.

256
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,653
Please sign.

257
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,495
That'll be all, young lady.

258
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,184
Pretty, isn't she?

259
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,849
The same series of blue-eyed girls.

260
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:57,024
All students, all the same age,
all the same type of beauty.

261
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,430
And all mysteriously missing.

262
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,003
This one's Swiss. You can imagine -
the embassy, the phone calls...

263
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:09,172
Speaking of blue-eyed girls,

264
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,745
what do I do with mine?

265
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,475
She was caught shoplifting.

266
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,482
Give her a stern lecture
and let her go.

267
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:22,557
But get her address.
It might come in handy.

268
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,598
This is how you end up in prison.

269
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,032
It was the first time.

270
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,898
I don't know what got into me.

271
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,308
Next time, you'll go to court.

272
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,467
Let me have your address.

273
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,807
1 2 rue des Pyrénées,
in the 20th arrondissement.

274
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,807
Now get lost.

275
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,463
I knew I would succeed.

276
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,369
To think that you didn't
believe in me.

277
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,799
Now you have your lovely face.

278
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:15,908
Your real face.

279
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,580
You can start life over again.

280
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,209
True.

281
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:26,849
But I also have to come
back to life for others.

282
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,523
How can l?

283
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,221
You can start by taking a trip,
a long trip.

284
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,763
I'll get you new papers.

285
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,503
You can choose yourself a name.

286
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,104
Won't that be fun?

287
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,407
A new face,

288
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,001
a new identity.

289
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,672
You're more beautiful than ever.

290
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:57,050
There's something angelic
about you now.

291
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,453
Angelic?
I don't know about that.

292
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:08,027
When I look in a mirror,
I feel I'm looking at someone

293
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,755
who looks like me,

294
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,894
but seems to come from the Beyond,

295
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,229
from the Beyond.

296
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,372
What about Jacques?

297
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:27,778
Obviously, that does pose a problem.

298
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,444
I'll explain it to him.

299
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,380
He loves you so much.

300
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,053
He'll be vevy happy.

301
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:42,696
Smile.

302
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,298
Smile.

303
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,561
Not too much.

304
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:11,660
Give him a shot of Pentothal.
I'll be right down.

305
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,126
Another emergency.

306
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,670
Will you come with me?
Sorvy, darling.

307
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,819
You're not wearing makeup, I hope?

308
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,758
Why?

309
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,801
No reason.

310
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,569
You have rosy cheeks, that's all.

311
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:03,911
See you tomorrow, darling.

312
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,880
I won't be long.
I'll come up to say good night.

313
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,935
You looked anxious examining her.

314
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:30,570
You're imagining things.

315
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,434
Why are you lying?

316
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,102
I've known you long enough
to read your face.

317
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,448
Tell me the truth.

318
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,687
I've failed.

319
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,261
February 15.

320
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,064
February 20.

321
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:11,271
A week after healing,
spots of pigmentation appear.

322
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:18,749
Later, palpation reveals
small subcutaneous nodules.

323
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:26,359
On Day 12, necrosis
of the graft tissue is apparent.

324
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,789
Day 20...

325
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:37,302
The first ulcerations and signs
of rejection of the graft tissue.

326
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,142
The necrotic graft tissue
must be removed.

327
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:20,941
With any old dog,
everything's possible.

328
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:28,519
I 'll have to settle
for this beastliness.

329
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,912
I 'm listening.

330
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,774
Say something.

331
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,509
This is infuriating!

332
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,286
Say something!

333
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,656
Jacques...

334
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,672
Are you mad?
Who were you calling?

335
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,300
No one.

336
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,207
Do you realize
how reckless you're being?

337
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,875
I know.
The dead should keep quiet.

338
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,608
Then let me be dead for good.

339
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:03,817
I can't stand it anymore!

340
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,881
I don't dare look at myself.

341
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,790
I can't touch my face

342
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,621
for fear of feeling the furrows
and crevices in my skin.

343
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:18,062
It feels like rubber!

344
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,698
Calm down, my dear.
Trust in him.

345
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,431
I'm sure he'll succeed.

346
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,900
He never will.

347
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:31,638
He'll keep experimenting
on me like one of his dogs.

348
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,876
A human guinea pig.
What a godsend for him!

349
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,380
You have no right to say that.

350
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,050
I want to die... please!

351
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:46,557
There are those injections he gives
the dogs when things go wrong!

352
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:50,526
Stop talking like that!

353
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,828
You have to kill me.
I can't stand it anymore!

354
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,208
Come up, quickly!

355
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,341
I'm sure of it.
I heard Christiane's voice.

356
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,953
You thought you did.
Over the phone.

357
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,715
Did you mention it
to Professor Génessier?

358
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:19,486
Of course. But he insists
he identified his daughter's body.

359
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,493
I know. I was there.

360
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,822
What can I say?

361
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,799
Maybe it was a practical joke.

362
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:29,234
Still...

363
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:32,306
Well, Doctor, I deal in facts.

364
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,533
These files are filled
with testimonies.

365
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,112
"I think that..."
"My feeling is that..."

366
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,112
A lot of vague descriptions. Here:

367
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,309
The red taxi picking up a girl.

368
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:48,116
The handsome woman
with a pearl choker

369
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,281
who was seen with the other girl.

370
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,855
A pearl choker?

371
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,860
That ring a bell?

372
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,592
Hold on.

373
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:05,033
Yes, it reminds me of someone.

374
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,232
But the other day you said
I was off the hook.

375
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,143
I hoped so, Miss Paulette Mérodon,

376
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:48,216
but the case went higher up.

377
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,246
They say I was too easy on you.

378
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:56,415
So that means I'm done for.

379
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,025
Does that mean prison?
- There's the trial first.

380
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,526
The trial!

381
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,603
My parents will never get over it.

382
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,203
I've been thinking.

383
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,035
There may be a way to avoid all this.

384
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,042
Obviously, it would involve
a great deal of discretion.

385
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,509
And some intelligence.

386
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:27,087
I can be vevy discreet.
And as for intelligence...

387
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,414
if it's not too complicated.

388
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,389
You'll see.

389
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,290
You just have to do us
a little favor.

390
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:38,797
- What do I have to do?
- Bleach your hair, for starters.

391
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:42,529
- You're kidding.
- That's not our style.

392
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,202
You have to be much blonder.

393
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,039
- It won't suit me.
- It doesn't matter.

394
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:53,443
Then a doctor will have you
admitted to a clinic.

395
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,346
- But I'm not sick!
- You'll say you are.

396
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,846
Brief her on the details.

397
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:03,683
At the clinic,
you'll complain of migraines.

398
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,827
I'll write it all down.

399
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,995
I'll give you a note for Dr. Gleize.

400
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,699
He'll give you a letter
for Dr. Génessier.

401
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,205
Speaking.

402
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,370
What's that?

403
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,877
Wait, I'll write it down.

404
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:38,084
She can be admitted
tomorrow morning.

405
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:42,892
Don't worvy.
I'll keep an eye on her.

406
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,966
Sure, it's just to check out a hunch.

407
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:52,806
If anything happens,
I'll let you know immediately.

408
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,826
You're coming along fine.

409
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,553
Just fine, Doctor.

410
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,904
The young lady
was admitted this morning.

411
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,133
- The attending physician?
- Dr. Gleize.

412
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,801
Here's his letter.

413
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,843
You're in great pain?

414
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:41,020
Yes.

415
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,522
At times.

416
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:51,695
Do a funduscopy
and an electroencephalogram today.

417
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,399
Are you going to shave my head?

418
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,398
I hope not, anyway.

419
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:02,305
That would be a shame.

420
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:14,719
An e... Iectro...encephalogram...

421
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,166
Don't be afraid.

422
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,843
We're friends.

423
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,581
Don't touch your forehead.

424
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,015
Tell me how many fingers
I'm holding up.

425
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:01,399
Three.

426
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,234
And now... how many?

427
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:11,570
Three.

428
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,940
No... two.

429
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,409
What do you think, Doctor?

430
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,143
I'm hopeful.

431
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,523
Tell me, Doctor.

432
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,053
Can you save him?

433
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,785
Of course we can.

434
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,454
Trust me.

435
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,368
Your prognosis?

436
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,097
And yours?

437
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,699
We agree.

438
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,275
Close your eyes.

439
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:27,250
Open your eyes.

440
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,635
That's it.
You can open your eyes.

441
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:50,143
You'll feel a slight electric shock.
It won't hurt.

442
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,305
Don't move.

443
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:05,985
Close.

444
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:11,664
Continue.

445
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,329
Open your eyes.

446
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:19,965
Close them.

447
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,396
Bring me the chart
as soon as you've finished.

448
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,711
Nothing seems to be wrong
with this Paulette Mérodon girl.

449
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,791
Bed 1 5 is hemorrhaging, sir.

450
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,593
Take care of it, Jacques.

451
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:04,940
Here's the chart, sir.

452
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,448
No abnormalities.

453
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,447
Release her tonight.

454
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,524
It will free up a bed.

455
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:21,023
We may have an emergency tonight.

456
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:47,487
- Do I give this form to you?
- That's right.

457
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:50,386
- May I make a call?
- To Paris?

458
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:54,185
What number?
- 4284.

459
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:07,673
Mom? It's Paulette.

460
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,243
Everything's fine.
I'm coming home.

461
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,879
See you in a bit.

462
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,782
What do I owe you?
- There's no charge.

463
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,681
How can I get back to Paris?

464
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:22,085
By bus. Turn left as you leave.
It's a 1 5-minute walk.

465
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:53,750
Can I give you a lift, miss?
I'm going your way.

466
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,480
With pleasure, madame.

467
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,229
Inspector Parot?

468
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,975
It's Jacques Vernon.

469
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:17,510
What's that, Doctor?

470
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,209
She left already?

471
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:22,612
They don't drag
their feet at your clinic.

472
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,882
They sure don't keep them locked up.

473
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,586
What did I tell you?

474
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:34,094
But we'll check to make sure
she got home safely.

475
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,759
Thanks for letting us know.

476
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,915
There are two men
asking for you at the clinic.

477
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,950
You know I don't have time.

478
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,446
Tell them to come back tomorrow.

479
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,580
Sorvy to disturb you at this hour.

480
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:39,652
We want to know if Miss Paulette Mérodon
checked out earlier.

481
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,448
How did you know
she was checking out?

482
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:47,688
She called home to say
she was on her way.

483
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:51,093
She never arrived.

484
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:53,496
So we came down to check.

485
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,162
Easy enough.

486
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,999
I gave the order
to release the patient.

487
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:07,009
Has Paulette Mérodon been released?
- I'll see.

488
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,519
So, interested
in this young lady, are you?

489
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:18,587
She's mixed up in a case we're on.

490
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,556
We wanted to talk to her tonight.

491
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,297
I have a feeling
that you're a little late.

492
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,868
Paulette Mérodon. Here it is.

493
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:34,901
I remember now: a girl with blue eyes.
She made a call from here.

494
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,476
I told her where she could
catch the bus.

495
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,638
You see?

496
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:42,974
I'm sorvy,

497
01:23:43,918 --> 01:23:45,715
but once they walk
through those doors,

498
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,219
my patients are no longer
my responsibility.

499
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,254
I understand.

500
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,053
Again, sorvy to disturb you.

501
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,897
Don't mention it.

502
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,166
Well, good night, Professor.

503
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:15,215
Since you're leaving, Jacques,
please show these gentlemen out.

504
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,571
I'm sorvy I wasted your time.

505
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,304
It's nothing.

506
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:49,909
We're used to following up bum leads.

507
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,810
And I put myself in your place.
You start getting ideas...

508
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,116
It's all these coincidences.

509
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:01,262
I wanted to put my mind at ease.

510
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,829
So we've put our mind at ease.

511
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,734
As for your heart,

512
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:11,634
I'm sure things will work out
for you on that end.

513
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,804
You're young, Doctor.

514
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,739
You have your life ahead of you.

515
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,914
Put that down!

516
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:49,802
Why?
