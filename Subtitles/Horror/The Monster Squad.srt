Do you see
these file folders?

The ones with your names
on them?

44
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,748
Can you guess
what's in these file folders?

45
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,149
I'll give you
a hint.

47
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:56,085
Lots of them.

And some wonderful
artwork as well.

49
00:06:59,123 --> 00:06:59,989
This is...?

50
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,393
Spider
with human head?

51
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:05,561
I'm sorry. Spider?
With human head.

52
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:09,532
Yeah. He eats dogs
and cats and rabbits.

53
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,034
Does he?

54
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,036
Sean thought him up.
You see, sir,

55
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,837
we kinda have
this monster club, okay?

56
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:17,340
And we draw those pictures to put
on our clubhouse walls.

57
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,108
Correction,
Mr. Crenshaw.

58
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:22,378
You draw pictures
during Mrs. Carlson's science class

59
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,547
when you're supposed
to be paying attention.

60
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,149
Wait. I just want
to say one thing.

61
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,851
I mean, Ms. Carlson's
a nice teacher and all,

62
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,154
but she's boring and
has an odd-shaped head.

63
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,189
That's why Sean and the guys
call her "Meow Mix,"

64
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,191
'cause her head's
shaped like a cat head.

65
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:37,527
But I don't, sir,
'cause-- how rude.

66
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,997
[chuckles]

67
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:41,531
Boys...

68
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,667
I hear you.

69
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:45,902
[chuckles]

70
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,537
I was a kid once.

71
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:49,672
I thought monsters
were cool.

72
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:51,607
And maybe, well--
well, gosh...

73
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,942
maybe I'm
just a big kid,

74
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,043
because, Sean, Patrick...

75
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,780
...I think science

76
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:58,548
is cool.

77
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,851
I dig it, man.

78
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:02,552
[laughs]

79
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,655
Now, I'm sure
both of you know

80
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,190
a great deal
about monsters,

81
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,058
but that's not the issue here.
The issue is...

82
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:12,862
...science is real.

83
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,564
Monsters are not.

84
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,034
We don't
know that, sir.

85
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,806
God, can you believe
Mr. Metzger?

86
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,676
Tell me about it. He touched me
and patted my shoulders and stuff.

87
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:27,877
The guy was fully
homo-ing out.

88
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,245
I smell like the '40s.

89
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,780
I mean, when they send you to school,
why don't they

90
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,182
tell you about the homos and
people with cat heads--

91
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:34,083
Ooh!
Oh!

92
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,591
Sorry,
Mrs. Carlson.

93
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,662
Meow. Meow.

94
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:47,897
She's married, Sean.

95
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:50,299
Oh, my God! Some guy
kisses her at night?

96
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,735
I mean, a priest said,
"I now pronounce you man and wife,"

97
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,903
and it was
okay with him?

98
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:54,604
Hey.
Where's Fat Kid?

99
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:01,077
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to our show.

100
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:03,680
Tonight's question:
What makes Fat Kid fat?

101
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:04,781
Fat kid?

102
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,382
Get out of here,
E.J.

103
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:07,784
"Get out of here, E.J."
Nope.

104
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,419
Not a good answer.
Doesn't make any sense.

105
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,320
Let's go to our man on the street. Derek.
Hi. I'm Derek,

106
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,389
and I'm in the street
where Fat Kid is blocking traffic.

107
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,624
Fat Kid, can't you
stop eating?

108
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,630
Look, I have
a glandular problem, okay?

109
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:23,633
At least I don't have a...
stupidity problem.

110
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,468
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

111
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:26,469
My name's Horace!

112
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
Horace.

113
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:28,137
Whore-ass.

114
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:35,578
Oops.
I tore it.

115
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:38,081
I guess I must have
a stupidity problem.

116
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:40,750
[whispers]
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

117
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,186
I said,
"You're an asshole."

118
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,620

119
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,656

121
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,007
Hey, Rudy.

122
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:06,509
E.J.

123
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:09,012
See you met
my friend Horace.

124
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,015
You okay?

125
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:14,517
Rudy, I, uh--
Shh!

126
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,054
You dropped
your candy bar, E.J.

127
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,389
It's his.

128
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,024
It's your now.

129
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:25,395
[voice cracks]
Rudy-- Eat.

130
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,930
Rudy, I'm not gonna--
Eat up!

131
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,032
And we'll
call it a day.

132
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:50,019
[Children groan]

133
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:53,556
Look, Patrick,
I told you before,

134
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,692
Wolfman cannot drive a car.
Yes, he can.

135
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,527
No, he can't!
Yes, he can.

136
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,696
All I'm saying is,
Sean, he could if he had to.

137
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,230
He could not. You're
being such a dork!

138
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,699
I know you are, but what am I?
A dork.

139
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,866
<i>I know you are,
but what am I?</i>

140
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,068
Oh, great. A feeb.
A dork.

141
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:06,636
I know you are,
but what am I?
A dork.

142
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,438
<i>I know you are,
but what am I?
Infinity! Look,</i>

143
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,074
Wolfman doesn't go to work.
He's not, like, a guy.

144
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:12,375
What are you
talkin' about?

145
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,143
He walks around.
He wears pants.

146
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:17,380
He had to wear pants
'cause those movies
were made in the '40s.

147
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,382
He had to wear 'em
so you wouldn't see his--

148
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:20,083
wolf dork.

149
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:22,585
Wolf dork?

150
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,056
[Girl]
You guys!

151
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,227
I saw him.
He was watching us.

152
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,228
Who?

153
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,596
Scary German Guy.

154
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,600
Sean, he give me
the creeps.

155
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,569
Oh, he's just
a dude on welfare.

156
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,137
Maybe he's
a German spy.

157
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:43,339
Oh, good one.
We're not at war
with Germany anymore.

158
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,208
We're at war
with Vietnam.

159
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,209
What?

160
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,377
<i>It's in Rambo.</i>

161
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:49,645
You guys missed it!
Oh! Fat Kid!

162
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:51,080
Rudy saved my life!

163
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,416
Do you think we could
talk him into joining
the Monster Club?

164
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:55,084
Can we?

165
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:55,618
Huddle.
Huddle.

166
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,821
Sean, he's
in junior high.

167
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:00,523
[Girl]
I hear he killed
his dad.

168
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:02,625
Get out of here,
Phoebe the Feeb!

169
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:10,633
Okay, you guys.
We should let him in
on one condition.

170
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:13,636
[All]
Monster test.

171
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,947
You guys!
I saw Scary--

172
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:25,982
I saw him!

173
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,817
I saw Scary German Guy!

174
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:28,651
He was watching!

175
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,122
<i>[Man]
I'm depressed.</i>

176
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,557
What for?
What do you mean,
what for?

177
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:36,125
I'm flyin'
a World War II bomber

178
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:37,727
with wooden crates in it
and dead bodies.

179
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:38,861
I should have a party?

180
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:41,464
Do they complain?
Do they get airsick?

181
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:43,166
Do they ask for more
of the little almond
things?

182
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:45,168
You're right.

183
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,538

Are you gonna listen or
look out the window?

220
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,884
[Patrick]
I told you he didn't want
to be in the club.

221

Hey, we're tryin'
to do the test
here, you know.

224

You're gonna
piss him off.

to like this club.

It's a monster test.

Go away, Pete!
Okay, question two.

234
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,748
Is Frankenstein
the name of the monster
or the guy who made him?

235
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:47,216
The guy.
Right.

That's it. Shoot him
with a sliver bullet.

00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,373
Nope. Sorry, Rudy.

Sean, it is a guy
with an ax.

307
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,321
Anyway, I thought
they killed him
in the last one.

308
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:40,823
They did.
And he returns
from his grave.

309
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:41,958
Returns
from the grave?

310
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,827
Sean, he always
returns from the grave.

311
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:46,596
If they blew him up,
put his head in a blender,

312
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,031
and mailed the rest
of the pieces to Norway,

313
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,233
he would still
return from the grave.
That was part seven.

what the plot is?

356
00:20:23,594 --> 00:20:25,161
Jesus Christ!
We need some backup!

357
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:30,166
Bon voyage!

358
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:39,175
Lock me up!

359
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,449
So, let me
get this straight.

360
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,550
You tellin' me
there was

361
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,786
this 2,000-year-old
mummy here, right?

362
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,788
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh.

363
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,690
Well, now he's not
here. He's gone.
Vanished. History.

364
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:55,291
Yes, sir.

365
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,859
And you're sayin'
you didn't hear anybody

366
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,828
come in here or leave.
Is that right?

367
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,396
Can you hear me now?
Hello?

368
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,699
I can
hear you fine.

369
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,267
So, nobody
took the mummy.

370
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:05,968
I would've heard them.
[camera shutter clicks]

371
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:07,704
Of course he would've.
What a stupid question.

372
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:10,540
Did you take him?

373
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,607
No, sir!

374
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,642
Just a shot.

375
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,444
That's it, Del.

376
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,045
This case is
too hard, man.

377
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:17,714
Let's be firemen
instead.

378
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:19,949
I'm glad you're gettin'
major laughs
out of this, Rich.

379
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,252
The problem is,
2,000-year-old dead guys

380
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:25,221
do not get up
and walk away

he's a werewolf!

They blow him away

outta here!

into the closet.

00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,523
Ooh!

500
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,494

not gonna sleep

with your mother
and me tonight,

502
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:53,796
so you can
forget it.

503
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:55,264
And keep this up,

504
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:57,567
and you're not gonna look
at those monster magazines.

505
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:58,534
Understand?

506
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:05,541
[closet door opens]
Uhh?

507
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,419
Okay.
We're all here.

508
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,687

the deal?

509
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:19,655
Yeah.
What the hell's
Monster Squad?

510
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:21,024
It's us.

Since when?

513
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:24,861
Since now!

514
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,863
What's a "squad"?

515
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,064
<i>It's like
Miami Vice, I think.</i>

516
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,534
Look. I think
there's monsters.

517
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:32,702
Like, real ones.

518
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:34,370
I heard my dad talking
on the telephone

519
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:35,905
to a guy down
at the police station.

520
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:38,274
There was a guy screaming
he was a werewolf.

521
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:41,344
And they shot him.
And the body disappeared
from the coroner van.

522
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:43,212
And the coroner guy
was dead.

523
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,315
So what? He got shot,
and the werewolf
took his body?

524
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,819
<i>No, you pinhead!
He was a werewolf!
Maybe.</i>

525
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,953
But if they shot him...

526
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,255
They must've been
regular bullets,

527
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:54,057
not silver ones.

528
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,025
Look, I know
this will sound
pretty stupid,

529
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,828
but a mummy disappeared
from the museum tonight.

530
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,097
Mummy came
in my house.

531
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,068
And, guys...

532
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,602
Dracula might
be here, too.

533
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:10,306
Aw, man,
Fat Kid farted!

534
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:11,674
Oh, God.
Did not.

535
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,743
Can't you
hold it? God!

536
00:31:13,744 --> 00:31:16,479
God damn it,
would you shut up?

537
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,814
Did you hear
a word I said?

538
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:20,249
The guys are dead!
Get a clue!

539
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,151
Something's out there,
and it's killin' people!

540
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:25,121
And if it's monsters,
nobody's gonna do a thing
about it but us.

541
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:28,624
So, what do we do?

542
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:31,761
Think this book
might be important.

543
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,229
Look. It's
Van Helsing's diary.

544
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,764
Mom said they found it
in an old house

545
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:36,432
on Shadowbrook Road.

546
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,334
But I can't read it.
It's all in German.

547
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:40,269
My sister takes German
in high school.

548
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,538
Your sister
doesn't speak German.
All she does

549
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,041
is hang around,
and the guys
touch her tits.

550
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,943
Your sister wouldn't
happen to live next-door,
would she?

551
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,277
So what?

552
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:50,113
That girl's
your sister?

553
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,650
So, what do you say?
Are we Monster Squad...

554
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:56,652
...or what?

555
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,094
Cool.
All right.

556
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:07,663
[Rudy]
How does that dog
get up here, anyways?

557
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,667
[soft thunder]

558
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:36,693
[rats squeaking]

559
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,203
Old friend.

560
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,206
How do you like
your new home?

561
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:52,709
Home.

562
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:57,213
[lock turns]

563
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:10,727
[sighs]

564
00:33:12,696 --> 00:33:14,697
I must
sleep soon,

565
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:16,432
so listen
very carefully.

566
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,735
Van Helsing's diary...

567
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:20,737
...is missing.

568
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,740
I want you
to retrieve it
for me.

569
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:26,242
You understand?

570
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:29,045
Yes...

571
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:30,179
Master.

572
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,248
Children...possess it.

573
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:37,353
I want you
to find them
and take the diary.

574
00:33:37,354 --> 00:33:39,255
If they do not
cooperate...

575
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:42,258
...you will kill them.

576
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:50,066
[Fat Kid]
Gentlemen, I'd just like
to say three words:

577
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:53,269
Scary German Guy.

578
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,775
Who else are we
gonna get to translate
this thing?

579
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:03,079
Come on. Somebody
go up and knock.

580
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,281
<i>You knock.
You're our leader.</i>

581
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:09,852
[Fat Kid]
Firstly, he's scary, okay?

582
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:12,255
And "B,"
he's German.

583
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:14,457
Maybe he doesn't
even speak English.

584
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,292
Okay, so what's
German for...

585
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:17,927
"Please don't
murder us"?

586
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:20,797
<i>Bitte, moerden-zie
uns nicht.</i>

587
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:28,805
[humming]

588
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,115
[heavy breathing]

589
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:39,816
[footstep]

590
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:44,320
[heavy breathing]

591
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,457
Boys...

592
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,827
time is almost up.

593
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:55,565
It's your
last chance for pie.

594
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:58,101
[Fat Kid]
Thanks, Mister, uh, guy.
Now, here we go.

595
00:34:58,102 --> 00:34:59,335
I mean...
No, thanks.

596
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,509
<i>So? Ja?</i>

597
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,845
Now, where
were we?

598
00:35:10,814 --> 00:35:12,315
<i>Ah... ja.</i>

599
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:15,284
"The amulet itself
is fairly small

600
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:18,621
and carved with
intricate symbols."

601
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:19,355
Oh.

602
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:22,125
Rather an odd-looking
thing,

603
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:23,426
don't you think?

604
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:25,094
Scary German
Guy's bitchin'.

605
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:27,497
Sir, the thing
I don't understand is

606
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:28,798
the part about
the equilibrium.

607
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:31,100
Well, according
to this rather
curious book

608
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,535
you have
brought me,

609
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:35,972
"The forces
of good and evil--"

610
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,776
Uh, that is a B-17,
in case you are
wondering.

611
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:40,376
It's rad!

612
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:42,812
"Good and evil

613
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,280
"are
in constant flux,

614
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:45,481
"back and forth.

615
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:48,418
"Only once,
every hundred years,

616
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:51,087
are these forces
balanced."

617
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:52,588
And what about
the amulet?

618
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:56,526
The amulet,
so nearly as I
can translate,

619
00:35:56,527 --> 00:36:00,697
is "concentrated good.

620
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:02,231
"It is a talisman

621
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:06,369
which wards off evil
and is..."

622
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,904
how you say, uh...

623
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:11,040
"indestructible"?

624
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,909
That means
it can't be
destroyed.

625
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,711
Or, in any case,

626
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:17,814
normally destroyed.
However,

627
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:20,550
and this part
is underlined...

628
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:24,153
"Once
every hundred years,

629
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:27,223
"at the stoke
of midnight,

630
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:31,394
"the amulet
becomes vulnerable,

631
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:33,262
"and at that moment,

632
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:35,131
it can be
shattered."

633
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:37,133
And if it is?

634
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:39,669
Then the balance

635
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,204
between
good and evil

636
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:44,640
will shift,
and evil will rule.

637
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:49,812
However, our friend
Mr. Van Helsing

638
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:54,751
claims there is a way
to stop the forces
of darkness.

639
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:55,651
How?

640
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:59,122
"If one
could gain possession

641
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:02,158
of the amulet
before those forces..."

642
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:06,462
"...then
every hundred years,

643
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:08,264
"at midnight,

644
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,233
"there is
another option:

645
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:15,672
"a ceremony which,
when followed
to the letter,

646
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:18,374
"will open a hole

647
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,677
"into Limbo itself

648
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:23,746
"where dwell
the damned;

649
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:25,048
"a vortex,

650
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:28,785
"which like
a great whirlwind,

651
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:32,689
"can swallow
the forces of evil
forever."

652
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,861
Well...does it describe
the procedure at all?

653
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:40,063
In detail.

654
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:42,165
This was the last entry.

655
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,534
On this date,

656
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:48,271
he was to battle
those forces himself.

657
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,806
Interesting.

658
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,941
It is
tomorrow's date,

659
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:54,210
one hundred years ago!

660
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:03,219
A hundred years ago?

661
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:07,724
Tomorrow night.

662
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:12,128
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

663
00:38:12,129 --> 00:38:13,963
Bye. Thank you
very much
for all your time.

664
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,932
Thank you.
I expect
you boys thought

665
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:19,068
I was some kind
of monster myself?
Hmm?

666
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:20,937
A vampire, perhaps?

667
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:22,939
That's quite
all right.

668
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,841
But I am not,
you know.

669
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,743
If I were
a vampire,

670
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:29,245
then I wouldn't have
a reflection.

671
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:33,750
Now, would I?

672
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:38,488
Man, you sure know
a lot about monsters.

673
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:41,858
Now that
you mention it...

674
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:43,760
I suppose I do.

675
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:49,766
[Fat Kid]
Guys, wait up!

676
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:55,538
Tomorrow night?
What do we have to
do again?

677
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,806
Blow a hole
in Dumbo?

678
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:58,041
Limbo, stupid.

679
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,275
So, how do
we know

680
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:00,977
the amulet's
there, anyway?

681
00:39:00,978 --> 00:39:04,080
Because, you dweeb,
Dracula's obviously
here looking for it.

682
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:07,383
If we don't find it
before he does,
we're beast bait.

683
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,818
Okay, so,
say we get
the amulet.

684
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:09,886
Then what?

685
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:11,387
Wait till
midnight...and?

686
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:12,388
We get
a virgin.

687
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:13,723
A virgin?
Yeah.

688
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:16,225
Okay, right.
Then what?

689
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:18,461
Well, our virgin
takes the amulet,

690
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:20,063
reads the magic spell
from the book,

691
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,899
and, blamo, we blow
a hole in Limbo.

692
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,067
That's so easy.

693
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,802
Oh, a cinch.
Piece of cake.
Yeah.

694
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:31,574
Rudy. Question.

695
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:32,575
Shoot.

696
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:33,309
Know any virgins?

697
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,880
[Sean]
Okay. Rudy, find
some silver bullets.

698
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:40,149
And where the hell
am I supposed to find
silver bullets?

699
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,251
Kmart?
I don't know.
Gimme a break.

700
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,287
Fat Kid, get a map.
Find Shadowbrook
Road.

701
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:47,023
What, do I look
in the index for
"big, scary mansion"?

702
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:48,024
Oh, you're a riot.

703
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:48,825
You guys!

704
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:54,564
How can we trust
Scary German Guy?

705
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,699
Why would he lie
about a thing
like this?

706
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,934
Sean!

707
00:39:57,935 --> 00:39:59,068
Phoebe,
have a life.
Okay?

708
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,069
You're being

Sean, we gotta
get an adult.

[Sean]
Absolutely no
grown-ups. Okay?

745
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:07,730
They'll lock him up
in a cage or something.

746
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,731
Dissect him.

747
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:11,067

on TV!

but what am I?
Sean.

886
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:37,640
Out.

887
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,210
What, Eugene?

888
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:43,146
Creature
stole my Twinkie.

889
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,153
So?

890
00:50:51,488 --> 00:50:52,655
What did you want
to ask me?

891
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:56,426
What do we want
to ask you.

892
00:50:56,427 --> 00:51:00,229
Okay. Um, Sis...
me and Ru--

893
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,531
Rudy?

894
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:02,532
Your show, Ace.

895
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,400
Okay.

896
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:07,370
We just wanted
to know...

897
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:09,172
[coughing]
if you're a virgin.
What?

898
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:11,674
[coughs]

899
00:51:11,675 --> 00:51:15,111
Okay. What we want
to know is...

900
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:16,379
are you a--
[blubbers]

901
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,180
Ahem. Look.

902
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:19,649
What your brother

903
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,318
is so delicately
attempting to inquire,

904
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,355
and let me, out of my own
personal curiosity,

905
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:27,290
is the degree to which
you may have or...

906
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:30,193
have not,
at some point in time...

907
00:51:34,832 --> 00:51:35,698
...been dorked?

908
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:39,402
You guys are sick!

909
00:51:39,403 --> 00:51:40,737
[gasps]

910
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:41,671
Guess what.

911
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,274
Fox Photo's got
a two-for-one deal
this week,

912
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:47,643
and wouldn't you know it,
there's a space

913
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:48,911
on the bulletin board

914
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,814
right between
the prom committee notes...

915
00:51:51,815 --> 00:51:52,715
and the football roster.

916
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:02,925
[Fat Kid]
Sean.

917
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:05,495
About this
Monster Squad thing.

918
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:07,430
Maybe we could go
back to the clubhouse

919
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:09,298
and rethink it
with the other guys.

920
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:12,335
Fat Kid...you're
bein' a wuss.

921
00:52:12,336 --> 00:52:14,570
Wuss?

922
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:15,605
Can it, Frank.

923
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:17,240
Time's runnin' out.

924
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:19,809
[whispering]
Sean, no!

925
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,345
Scary house...
real monsters...

926
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:25,515
us...12 years old?
Remember?

927
00:52:25,516 --> 00:52:28,084
Midnight...
end of world.
Remember?

928
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:30,753
Master...is near.

929
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,758
Master wants
children dead.

930
00:52:49,606 --> 00:52:50,606
Um, Sean?

931
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:52,342
Maybe we could be

932
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:54,744
like Math Squad
instead, you know...

933
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:57,046
do math problems.
Stay home.

934
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:58,214
Or Nature Squad.

935
00:52:58,215 --> 00:53:00,283
We could look at rocks,
collect birds.

936
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:01,984
Not be dead. See,

937
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:03,786
it's this whole death thing
I'm not crazy about.

938
00:53:18,068 --> 00:53:21,304
[hinges squeaking]

939
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:46,763
[chuckles]
Well...no amulet.

940
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:47,797
Let's go.

941
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:50,433
Look. We got
two consolations.

942
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:52,435
Number one,
Frankenstein's
on our side.

943
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:54,704
And number two,
my dad's a cop.

944
00:53:54,705 --> 00:53:57,340
Anybody fools around with us,
he kicks their ass.

945
00:53:58,742 --> 00:53:59,342
Hey, Frankie.

946
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:01,344
Come on.

947
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:07,350
[loud step,
boards creak]

948
00:54:10,888 --> 00:54:12,355
[explosion]

949
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:21,831
Frank!

950
00:54:25,569 --> 00:54:28,237
Wake up!
Wake up!

951
00:54:28,238 --> 00:54:29,806
[Sean]
Eugene, get
away from there!

952
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:31,641
He won't wake up!

953
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:34,077
Fat Kid, use your eyes.
Does it look like
you can help him?

954
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:36,646
But-- But what
do I do, Sean?

955
00:54:36,647 --> 00:54:37,880
A monster!

956
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:39,115
Don't call him
a monster.

957
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:41,150
Well...what
if he's dead?

958
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,885
Then he died
to help us.

959
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:45,088
Now, look.

960
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:48,157
I'm the leader
of this squad,

961
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:48,891
so listen up.

962
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:53,329
He said Dracula
knows we're here.

963
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,865
So let's just try
to find the amulet...

964
00:54:58,669 --> 00:54:59,902
...and get the hell
outta here.

965
00:55:01,672 --> 00:55:02,672
[roars]

966
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:04,674
Sean!
Aah!

967
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:06,109
Kick him
in the nards!
What?

968
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,176
Kick him in the nards!

969
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:09,412
He doesn't have nards!
Do it! Do it!

970
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:14,150
Wolfman's got nards!

971
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:16,019
Come on! Come on!

972
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,320
[growling]
Oh...

973
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:19,889
[barking]

974
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:23,893
[Fat Kid whimpers]

975
00:55:27,898 --> 00:55:29,365
Aah!

976
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:30,700

980
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:45,381
[screaming continues]

981

[growls]

982
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,623
<i>What are you doin'?
Haven't you read
The Hardy Boys?</i>

983
00:55:53,624 --> 00:55:56,059
You pull some lever down
and a secret door opens!

984
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,361
You gotta
be kidding!
You have
a better idea?

985
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,633

[horn blows]

988
00:56:09,673 --> 00:56:11,507
[Patrick]
Come on, Sean.

989
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:13,343
Damn!
Where is he?

990
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:14,410
Where are you?
Come in!

991
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:17,680
Sean!

992
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:19,415
Where are you,
Sean?

993
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:23,152
10:00.
They're late.

994
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:25,221
Maybe the monsters
got them.

995
00:56:25,222 --> 00:56:27,924
"Maybe the monsters
got them."

996
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,932
[All screaming]

997
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:38,868
Can we go home, Sean?
Oh, great.

998
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:41,704
Please? Can't we go home?
Just great.

999
00:56:41,705 --> 00:56:43,339
Frankenstein's dead,

1000
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,674
Eugene's whining,

1001
00:56:44,675 --> 00:56:46,476
and we're sitting here
with Pirate Bill.

1002
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:48,711
[Eugene] Come on, Sean.
Man, we're dead.

1003
00:56:48,712 --> 00:56:49,445
[Fat Kid]
Eugene, stop it.

1004
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:56,953
Bingo.

1005
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:23,479
You guys, I got it!

1006
00:57:25,082 --> 00:57:26,616
Give it to me.

1007
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:27,984
Give it to me!

1008
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:30,253
Aah!

1009
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:33,389
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

1010
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,824
Help!
[Pete barks]

1011
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:35,825
Give it to me!

00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:38,394
Aah!

1013
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:41,497

Get outta here!

[Phoebe]
You guys,

1017
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:03,453
we got Scary German Guy
to help us!

1018
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:05,388
The cavalry!
Thank Christ.

1019
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:06,889
Yeah, we figured
you guys were in trouble.

1020
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,891
It was boss!
I saw Dracula!

1021
00:58:08,892 --> 00:58:11,427
And I kicked Wolfman in the nards--
Fat Kid, bag it. Okay?

1022
00:58:11,428 --> 00:58:13,096
[Sean] Is she a virgin?
Why don't you put it

1023
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:14,731
on the 6:00 news,
you little shit?

1024
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:15,732
Yeah, she is.

1025
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,066
Perhaps we should all

1026
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:19,002
go back to my place
for some pie.

1027
00:58:20,704 --> 00:58:22,805
The book was right.

1028
00:58:22,806 --> 00:58:25,308
Don't you see?
It's all true!

1029
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:28,244
We found the amulet,
but now there's monsters after us.

1030
00:58:28,245 --> 00:58:30,913
We gotta go to a place
where there's a lot of people.

1031
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:31,948
Church.
What?

1032
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:33,449
Church!
He's right.

1033
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,318
There's an old church
in the town plaza.

1034
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:36,319
Perfect.

1035
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,520
Monsters hate religious stuff.

1036
00:58:40,324 --> 00:58:41,324
Del.

1037
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:42,325
Del. Del!

1038
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:43,326
Look, I'm sorry.

1039
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,761
What, you
tryin' to tell me

1040
00:58:44,762 --> 00:58:46,162
that we're gonna go
all the way out to Shadowbrook Road

1041
00:58:46,163 --> 00:58:47,930
because you get
a call from some guy

1042
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:49,465
who tells you
he's a werewolf?

1043

Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!

1044
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:52,969
Look, I'm sorry.

1045
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,237
I guess it's feasible, Del.

1046
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:55,772
Listen to me.
Come on, man.

1047
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:58,374
I apologize. All right?
Ha ha ha!

1048

00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,416
Look! It's 20 minutes
till midnight!

1050
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,618
We pull this off,

Holy shit!

00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,061
Jesus Christ!

1055
00:59:23,967 --> 00:59:25,668
Give me some slack!
What are you doing?

1056
00:59:25,669 --> 00:59:28,037
Patrick, just give me some slack!
No!

1057
00:59:28,038 --> 00:59:30,039
You're closer! Just give me some slack!
No way!

1058
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,207
Don't be a wuss!

1059
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,408
Okay!

1060
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:34,577
Aah!
