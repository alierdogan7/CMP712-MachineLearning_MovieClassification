1
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,323
Some people say, this world is ugly

2
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,594
yet, it is beautiful at the same time

3
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,592
I don't know if they are right

4
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,723
But

5
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm about to see the world with fresh eyes

6
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,619
Wong Kar Mun
I'm giving you a local anesthetic now

7
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,921
The operation will take about 2 hours

8
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,515
Are you ready?

9
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,484
Who's that?

10
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:57,723
Quiet! We don't want to alarm the nurses

11
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,622
I am in the bed next to yours

12
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,432
I heard that you just had an eye operation

13
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,864
I've had many operations here

14
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,938
I know the whole hospital. They are all nice to me

15
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,238
How old are you?

16
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,506
Why so many operations?

17
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,403
I'm 11. l should have been in junior high by now

18
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,413
but my mother says I have a brain tumor

19
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,017
which affects my nerves

20
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,849
That's why l pass out all the time

21
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,887
They have to remove it

22
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,616
But it's so large and dangerous

23
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,623
they have to operate many times

24
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,991
So l skipped school last year
and stayed here ever since

25
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,934
You're so young, yet so brave!

26
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,397
Once you can see again

27
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,834
l'll take you out to play

28
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,838
The world is really beautiful.

29
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,749
Wong Kar Mun
when l remove the bandages from your eyes

30
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,858
it might hurt a little at first

31
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,194
lf it hurts too much, let me know

32
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,420
We can always do it tomorrow

33
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:31,551
Now, let's try.

34
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,316
Open your eyes slowly

35
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,952
Hey, don't force yourself if it hurts

36
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,932
lt hurts!

37
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,977
ls it too painful?

38
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,345
Dr Lo, she must be in a lot of pain!

39
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:36,078
She hasn't cried out
in pain ever since she was a kid!

40
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:39,587
Grandma, let Dr Lo do his job

41
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,188
Please don't worry about it.

42
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,226
Very few patients experience immediate success

43
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:47,224
lt takes time...

44
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,994
...for the eye and brain to worktogether

45
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,162
Come on

46
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,704
Ying Ying

47
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,342
Ying Ying

48
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,916
Hi, can you see now?

49
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,214
I'm Ying Ying

50
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,658
Can you really see me?

51
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,896
l think l can see. I'm not sure

52
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,162
Great! You can see!

53
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,672
Nurse, she can see!

54
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,469
Nurse

55
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,677
her eyes are working!

56
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,642
She sees me! Come quick

57
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,040
Grandma!

58
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,404
The hospital called!

59
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,241
What?

60
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,469
Mun can see!

61
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:43,170
Really?

62
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,350
Let's go to the hospital now

63
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,719
Are you going to discharge me now?

64
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,281
Not so soon

65
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,617
Every cornea recipient starts off near-sighted...

66
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,793
by as much as 1,000 degrees

67
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,724
Only when your eye muscles are able to adapt

68
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:02,024
will this falls to about 200 degrees

69
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,429
When will she have perfect eyesight then?

70
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,830
No one has perfect eyesight,

71
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,165
most people are near-sighted by about 100 degrees

72
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,567
Does that mean...

73
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,903
...she will need to wear glasses?

74
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,133
That won't be necessary

75
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:16,711
All she needs
for the moment is a pair of sunglasses.

76
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,617
Mun, get some rest

77
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,944
lf everything goes well, you can be released early

78
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:31,488
You can take off your sunglasses now

79
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,958
Try to get used to the light gradually

80
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,025
lf you feel pain

81
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,893
or if your eyes start watering

82
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,637
then you should close your eyes

83
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,033
and let your eyes rest

84
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,468
Here, l'll help you onto bed

85
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:44,799
Nurse

86
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,340
ls there a mirror in every washroom?

87
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,680
l'll take you there

88
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,655
Here

89
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:08,961
Slowly

90
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:14,266
Take your time and call me if you need anything

91
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,461
Who's that?

92
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,301
Ying Ying, is that you?

93
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,468
Why are you so quiet?

94
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:05,108
I'm having another operation tomorrow

95
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,439
You promised to take me out once l can see

96
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,912
You promised to take me out...

97
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,175
...once l can see

98
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,018
We'll go out and have fun...

99
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,381
...after your operation

100
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,257
Did they say you can leave the hospital already?

101
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:16,955
Not yet!

102
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:20,059
But even if l do, l can always drop by for a visit

103
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,564
Let's take a picture together.

104
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,394
Let's do it outside! Alright

105
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:29,004
Let's go... But where?

106
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,507
Let's go that way!

107
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,439
What's this?

108
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:34,372
A camera

109
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,805
Camera?

110
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,015
Now, look this way

111
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,980
Ok

112
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,448
Ready...1, 2, 3!

113
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,918
Madam, are you alright?

114
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,799
Hello...

115
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,684
I'm freezing...

116
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,848
Send this one to Block C

117
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,481
We have a full house in Block B

118
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,250
Nurse...

119
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:10,716
did the old lady pass away?

120
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:13,483
Yes, we've taken her away

121
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,453
But last night...

122
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,392
l saw someone drop by to visit her

123
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,962
They even went out together

124
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,531
Are you sure?

125
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,726
We don't allow any visitors here at night

126
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,037
Where's Ying Ying?

127
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,039
She went for an operation this morning

128
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:55,957
Dr. Lo preferred that

129
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,032
you stay for two more days...

130
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,735
but because
l'll be away on flight duty for two weeks

131
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,134
No one will be able to pick you up then

132
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,500
lt was easier to have you discharged now.

133
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,376
This way
you and grandma can spend more time together.

134
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:08,378

135
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,380
My...it's already 3 p.m.!

136
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,943
Hope this place is easy to find...

137
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,100
...hope we won't be too late

138
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,573
We're only 10 minutes late for our appointment

139
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:44,575

140
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,942
I have to leave for work soon

141
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:51,716
I'm sorry.
Dr Lo just stepped out for a few minutes

142
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:51,718

143
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:51,720

144
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:52,617
Ok

145
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:53,721
There he is

146
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,119
Is my 3 o'clock here?

147
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,418
Yes, they are

148
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,326
Mun, let's go

149
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,396
Let me introduce you to the nature of my work.

150
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,399
From now on

151
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:08,531
I am Ms Wong Kar Mun's psychotherapist

152
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,175
Since Ms Wong lost her sight at the age of two

153
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,910
Her visual vocabulary

154
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,340
is extremely limited

155
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,410
and she has probably forgotten most of that

156
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,277
Lets' say

157
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,646
Ms Wong, could you please remove your glasses?

158
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,288
and let your eyes get used to the light

159
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,995
Can you tell me what's in my hand?

160
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,134
You'll recognize that it's a stapler...

161
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,776
...once you touch it

162
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,274
because all your previous knowledge of objects

163
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,574
were based on touch, not on sight

164
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,215
Now you are no longer blind

165
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:56,578
My job is

166
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:57,810
help you re-establish

167
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,113
howto use your eyes

168
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,188
and understand what you see

169
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:03,417
Actually, I'm not too worried about that aspect

170
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,229
What concerns me is your psychological state

171
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,425
After regaining sight...

172
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,625
many patients end up feeling alienated and fearful

173
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:12,632
Dr. Lo

174
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:15,237
ls the other Dr Lo a relative of yours?

175
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,834
You mean Dr C.T.Lo?

176
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,573
Yes, he's my uncle

177
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,705
So...what time do you finish worktoday?

178
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,815
Ms Wong is my last patient for the day

179
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:33,180
Well...you see, l need to catch my flight

180
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:36,551
Can l trouble you to send Mun home after this?

181
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:39,853
l see, of course

182
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,463
AnyAfter all, starting from today...

183
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,827
l need to take
Ms Wong outdoors for her training anyway.

184
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:44,696
OK

185
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,098
You can go ahead

186
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:48,600
I'm fine by myself

187
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,670
I'm used to it

188
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:04,049
That's you as a little girl

189
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,951
Your father filmed this a long time ago...

190
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:11,093
so that you could see it if your eyes ever healed

191
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:15,323
He stopped filming after he divorced your mother

192
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,857
That was 7 or 8 years ago

193
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:19,364
Grandma...

194
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,866
ls it true when Dad comes back

195
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:22,767
he'll take us to Vancouver?

196
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,740
l know you don't want to go,

197
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,675
but life in Vancouver moves at a slower pace

198
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,609
lt will be better for you

199
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,646
l can't even read Chinese
how will l learn English?

200
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:36,817
Grandma

201
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,886
l don't want to rely on others forever

202
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,714
l want to learn to write

203
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,722
and find a job in Hong Kong

204
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,359
l want to be independent

205
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:48,429
Your father would worry about you going to work.

206
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,826
I have to do the dishes
l'll leave you to watch this alone

207
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,983
Can l help you?

208
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,816
Have you seen my report card?

209
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,548
No

210
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:48,759
Do your live around here?

211
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,161
Mun, who's that?

212
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,026
lt's a little boy, Grandma

213
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,723
Did a report card ever turn up on our balcony?

214
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,767
That kid is teasing you

215
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,099
Just ignore him

216
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:30,286
Kid, what are you eating?

217
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,523
I'm very hungry

218
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:41,302
What's your problem?

219
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:43,033
Everyone
we have two pieces of good news today

220
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,529
First...

221
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,731
Ms. Tone Deaf had a successful operation!

222
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,905
And second, for our Christmas charity concert...

223
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,985
We'll be performing with Vanessa Mae!

224
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,751
Mr. Cheng
why haven't l received the practice schedule?

225
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,850
Mun, you know, after all...

226
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:46,154
we're an organization for the blind

227
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,026
You're always welcome to come to practice...

228
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,065
but perhaps you should do something else
for the performance

229
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,167
such as coordination

230
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:54,530
or taking care of our members

231
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,065
l can even arrange for you

232
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,673
to help out at the centre

233
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:00,335
Mr. Cheng

234
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:03,376
l really want to take part in this performance

235
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,780
I've practiced so long

236
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,540
was just because of this concert!

237
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:11,214
l understand, but...

238
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:14,419
Excuse me, Mr. Cheng

239
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:15,990
Vanessa Mae's agent

240
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,684
wants us to fax over her schedule

241
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,797
l'll be with you right away.

242
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,632
Mun, Mun?

243
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,470
Let's finish our discussion again. I have to go.

244
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,504
Let's finish our discussion again. I have to go

245
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,354
Grandma!

246
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,055
Are you leaving?

247
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,354
Yes, to class

248
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:01,962
Come back early for dinner

249
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,599
I've prepared some special turnip soup

250
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,092
Bye!

251
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:11,365
Have you seen my report card?

252
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:15,078
Didn't you find it yet?

253
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,407
l really haven't seen it

254
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,377
Perhaps you should ask someone else

255
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:45,801
Ying Ying!

256
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:50,312
Excuse me, l'd like to talkto her

257
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,310
Look what I've brought for you?

258
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,485
Sis, I've just had chemo-therapy,

259
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,420
l'll throw up if l eat

260
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,596
lt's OK

261
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,662
Then we'll save it for when you get better.

262
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,994
lf only we had believed him just that once

263
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,164
or given him a chance to explain

264
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,804
he might still be here playing video games

265
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,474
Who would have expected
him to jump off just like that?

266
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,847
Suicide is a dreadful sin

267
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,451
The souls of those who commit suicide...

268
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,654
are obliged to repeat their painful deaths everyda

269
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,651
To help him break out of this vicious cycle of pai

270
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,694
we need to tackle the cause of his suicide

271
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,365
Only then can his soul leave this world in peace

272
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,863
Have you ever considered

273
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,663
he might be telling the truth?

274
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,969
Perhaps he really did lose his report card.

275
00:34:33,937 --> 00:34:36,531
Have you been teaching calligraphy long?

276
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,332
Yes, many years indeed

277
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,566
l'll teach you howto hold the brush

278
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:44,112
l'll teach you howto hold the brush

279
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,474
Use your big thumb and middle finger

280
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,514
and form a circle just like this

281
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,157
Like this, try

282
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:58,559
Very few want to learn calligraphy nowadays

283
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:03,956
l used to teach 3 lessons a week

284
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:08,829
Now, it's down to only one

285
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:14,236
l'll let you try writing by yourself

286
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,173
Try it yourself

287
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,732
Why are you sitting in my chair?

288
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:18,601
Why are you sitting in my chair?!

289
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:30,615
What is this? What is going on?

290
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,254
What are you looking for? Are you okay?

291
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,366
What happened?

292
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:47,035
Are you feeling unwell?

293
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:51,969
ls Dr. Lo here?

294
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:54,572
Ms. Wong, you are early

295
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:56,541
Your next appointment isn't until Friday

296
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,514
He won't be back from his meeting until 5 p.m.

297
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:04,813
Will he definitely be here at 5 p.m.?

298
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,756
lf it's urgent

299
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:08,254
l can page him for you now

300
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,155
l'll be back at 5

301
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:15,582
You can see them, too?

302
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:20,383
They don't usually want to be seen

303
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,452
But you'll get used to it

304
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,829
All the stores nearby have been bought up

305
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,021
only my boss refuses to sell

306
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,430
He seems to be
expecting his wife and child to visit

307
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,934
Actually, he can't see them at all

308
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,613
...there was a car accident over there...

309
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,562
Mun!

310
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,366
My secretary said you were asking for me

311
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,634
What's the matter?

312
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,782
Will you help me?

313
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:39,992
Of course l will

314
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,929
Your eyes hurt?

315
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,391
Will you believe me?

316
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,529
Yes...

317
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,668
What is it?

318
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:56,007
The shadows...they come to bring the dead

319
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:58,744
What shadow?

320
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,247
When l was at the hospital...

321
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,621
l saw a man

322
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:14,085
He...he took an old lady with him

323
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,293
The next morning, the old lady was dead...

324
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:24,068
My room keeps changing
suddenly into a different room...

325
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,544
l even saw a person missing her lower body...

326
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:41,951
When he rushed over, it was like an electric shock

327
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:46,059
my whole body went numb...

328
00:42:55,238 --> 00:42:56,671
Calm down

329
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,431
And tell me slowly

330
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,714
When l was little...

331
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:13,116
Granny told me...

332
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:17,354
l was not an ordinary child.

333
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:21,022
God had given me some obstacles...

334
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:26,000
so that l would grow up
to be an extraordinary person

335
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,073
Now l understand

336
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,305
what it means to be extraordinary

337
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,136
An extraordinary person

338
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,540
can see things others can't...

339
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:42,610
and feel pain that others won't feel

340
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,690
Maybe, l was never meant to see this world

341
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:56,925
l don't want to terrified in bed every night...

342
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,168
l don't want to terrified in bed every night...

343
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,099
then awaken horrors every morning

344
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:09,435
l just want to be an ordinary person

345
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,883
Dr. Lo, can you help me?

346
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:19,183
Yes, of course l will

347
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:26,552
One of my psychology professors...

348
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,558
from the States...

349
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:29,126
has just come to Hong Kong to visit

350
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,061
Let's meet him tomorrow

351
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:33,364
He might be able to help

352
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,420
How can you help me when you don't believe me?

353
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:30,891
What's going on?

354
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:33,856
Excuse me, I have to go

355
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:35,223
Call me if you need anything

356
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:36,522
Goodbye

357
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,527
Who's that?

358
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:40,964
A friend

359
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,299
He asked your sister to take something to States

360
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:45,498
Yes, that's right

361
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,005
You are home early

362
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:49,701
Aren't you supposed to be back next week?

363
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:51,875
Well...

364
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:53,115
a co-worker switched her shift with mine.

365
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,112
So l come back a bit earlier

366
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:55,477
lt's smoky here

367
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:57,352
Why don't you go up?

368
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:52,651
14th floor, unit-C

369
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,226
Have you seen my report card?

370
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,632
Stop asking me?!
I've already told you l haven't seen it!

371
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:13,640
Have you seen my report card?

372
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:27,320
15th floor, unit-C

373
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:45,152
Uncle, listen to me...

374
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:46,892
No way!

375
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:48,996
Only you can help us with this!

376
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:50,627
I've already said no!

377
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,830
lf you still respect me as your uncle

378
00:52:54,103 --> 00:52:55,695
and respect yourself as my nephew

379
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:58,237
you should have never approached me with this!

380
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:01,367
First of all

381
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,942
You should know only too well...

382
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:04,870
what medical ethics are regarding organ transplant

383
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,309
And you should also knowthat...

384
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:09,643
the identity of the cornea donor

385
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,615
is concealed from me

386
00:53:11,854 --> 00:53:13,014
What shadow?

387
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:15,185
One cornea transplant and she starts seeing ghosts

388
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,853
You actually believe that?

389
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,458
What if l do?

390
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,622
Then we have even less to talk about!

391
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,261
Uncle...

392
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:30,336
Don't tell me you fell for your own patient

393
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,148
Hello?

394
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:44,546
Dr. Lo, is that you?

395
00:53:44,787 --> 00:53:46,186
Mun is in trouble!

396
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:48,514
Can you come over immediately?

397
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,453
Yes, right away

398
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,430
Yes, l admit

399
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,193
she's more than a patient to me

400
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,477
Mun!

401
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,389
How long do you plan on hiding in this little room

402
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,892
Five years? Seven? Or ten?

403
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,666
You have to confront your problem sooner or later

404
00:54:35,504 --> 00:54:38,803
You want to play violin? Go play with the troupe!

405
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:43,043
l can accept you pretending to be blind

406
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,574
But even then

407
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:46,974
then you didn't isolate yourself here

408
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,381
l just want to help

409
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:14,895
Mun!

410
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:35,748
Sis.

411
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,129
Ying Ying, what are you doing here?

412
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,792
l can leave the hospital now

413
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:57,799
You can?

414
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:01,272
Yes, l don't need any more operations

415
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,636
l can go to school now

416
00:58:03,712 --> 00:58:05,077
So...

417
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:09,477
hen once I am out of here

418
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,255
we can go out...

419
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:18,659
we can take pictures, we can even...

420
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,764
I'm so happy that you can see now,

421
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,805
because this world is really beautiful

422
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:46,483
Ying Ying...

423
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:49,757
lt's alright! Cheer up.

424
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,621
Be strong and things will work out for the best

425
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:01,027
I have to go now

426
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,843
Ying Ying!

427
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,319
Wong Kar Mun, l want to tell you...

428
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:29,180
Ying Ying has already...

429
01:00:34,997 --> 01:00:38,899
l know... l just saw her

430
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:43,298
l know she's dead

431
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:38,286
What are you looking at?

432
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:41,023
Ying Ying

433
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:46,932
Can you see her?

434
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:57,445
lt wasn't her

435
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:01,306
Don't know why she didn't show up today

436
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:09,121
Are you not afraid anymore?

437
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,687
I don't think I have a choice

438
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:18,396
I see all these things anyway.

439
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:22,499
At least, I get to see the people l care about

440
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:37,279
What's this?

441
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:39,687
Ying Ying made this for you

442
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:51,791
What's written on it?

443
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,532
Don't forget me

444
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:03,035
She put in the wrong photo though

445
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:04,471
Who's this?

446
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:07,278
It's you!

447
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,118
Don't you recognize yourself yet?

448
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:34,437
What is going on?

449
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:37,074
Who are you?

450
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:47,713
Who the hell are you?!

451
01:04:25,427 --> 01:04:28,021
We believe that
the very last consciousness of a mortal

452
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,498
carries over to the afterlife

453
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:34,001
That is
the very thought of a person in his final moment..

454
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:36,599
would become the eternal consciousness of his soul

455
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,439
Those who die a sudden death

456
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,606
have no recollection of the instance of death

457
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:46,973
Their souls remain in
this world as if they're still alive

458
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:50,011
But there are others
who intentionally refuse to leave

459
01:04:50,252 --> 01:04:52,914
mostly due to unresolved
problems during their lifetime

460
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,982
These souls can't be consoled
while their problems remain

461
01:04:56,992 --> 01:05:00,519
There is only one way to help them,

462
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:03,196
and that is to resolve what they left unsettled.

463
01:05:04,299 --> 01:05:07,564
The woman whom
Ms Wong keeps seeing after resuming her sight.

464
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,670
We have to resolve her problems
so that she can move on

465
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,154
l hope l haven't done anything wrong

466
01:05:34,229 --> 01:05:36,595
Even if it's wrong, it'd be my fault

467
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:38,799
And l won't regret it

468
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:43,234
Were you reincarnated into the wrong body?

469
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:44,601
Why are you so different from...

470
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,467
...the rest of the family?

471
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:53,241
Be careful

472
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:06,416
Bangkok, Thailand

473
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:16,971
Dr. Lo believed you in the end?

474
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,473
Let's just say Dr Lo is not involved

475
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:22,911
He's a professional after all

476
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,044
you know what l mean?

477
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:26,646
Yes

478
01:06:27,215 --> 01:06:28,443
Are we close?

479
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,817
I'm not sure

480
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:34,284
lt says here that her
Chinese name was Chiu Wai Ling

481
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:35,853
A Thai born Chinese

482
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,086
Here are her hospital records

483
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:19,765
This is Siam-Rach Hospital

484
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:21,593
Sl-AM-LA?

485
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,431
This is probably the place

486
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:26,904
Let's get off to take a look

487
01:07:57,806 --> 01:07:58,795
Hi

488
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:03,669
This is Siam-Rach Hospital?

489
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,312
Yes. Right

490
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:09,849
l want to meet a doctor, his name is Eak

491
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:13,080
Please come help

492
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,085
Can l help you?

493
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:19,953
l want to meet a doctor

494
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:21,923
his name is Eak

495
01:08:23,598 --> 01:08:24,622
You know him?

496
01:08:26,134 --> 01:08:27,328
No

497
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,365
lt's there a Doctor name Eak here?

498
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:49,582
lt mentioned here

499
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:53,521
lt's this hospital, his name is Eak

500
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:55,223
He's not here now

501
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,727
Not here?

502
01:10:04,499 --> 01:10:05,591
Wah!

503
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,694
Wah!

504
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,629
What is it?

505
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:13,865
This is the place

506
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:15,009
What place?

507
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,675
The place I've been having nightmaes about

508
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:18,809
Nightmares?

509
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,075
This has to be it!

510
01:10:24,419 --> 01:10:25,886
Doctor Eak!

511
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:27,210
What's the matter?

512
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,481
You have two visitors.

513
01:10:31,593 --> 01:10:34,528
Mister, this is Dr Eak

514
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:35,927
You're Dr. Eak

515
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:36,892
Yes

516
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:37,757
My name is Wah

517
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:39,433
Hello Nice to meet you

518
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:40,994
lt's her

519
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:43,295
After the Cornea operation

520
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:45,197
We come over here

521
01:10:45,473 --> 01:10:46,804
To thankthe donator's family

522
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:49,133
Hope you can give us some detail

523
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,068
Here is the file

524
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:01,017
Are you two from Hong Kong?

525
01:11:01,656 --> 01:11:02,918
You speak Mandarin?

526
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,915
Can you help us?

527
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:08,853
Sorry

528
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:11,628
Sorry, l can't disclose our hospital records

529
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,525
This is our hospital policy

530
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:15,833
Please understand

531
01:11:16,037 --> 01:11:16,935
Wait!

532
01:11:17,138 --> 01:11:19,572
We need to see the donor's family urgently

533
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,366
Could you perhaps askthem

534
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:23,407
if they are willing to meet us?

535
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,044
Her family will not be willing to meet with you

536
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:28,578
Who are you to Ling?

537
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:30,810
Please leave

538
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:32,580
Wait!

539
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:36,087
After l got Ling's corneas

540
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:38,450
l started to see things that she saw!

541
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:50,362
Ling was a sad and lonely girl

542
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:53,834
All of the villagers stayed away from her

543
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:55,402
Why?

544
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:57,609
From time to time

545
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,609
she would weep outside someone's door

546
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,539
Afterwards

547
01:12:01,816 --> 01:12:04,307
a person in that house would pass away

548
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,682
So everyone took her to be a witch...

549
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,353
and always chased her away when they saw she

550
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,488
The children treated her like a monster

551
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,898
even l threw stones at her when l was a kid...

552
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:23,429
Because none of you
could believe that she foresaw death?

553
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:26,504
Maybe it was because of fear.

554
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:29,770
So, do you believe it now?

555
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,455
This is it

556
01:13:02,477 --> 01:13:06,004
Mrs. Chui, these two friends are from Hong Kong

557
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:10,082
Nobody welcomed Ling

558
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:14,718
so she hardly ever set foot in the village

559
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,615
Yet, on the night of the fire

560
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,491
many saw her running around

561
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,959
shouting hysterically...

562
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:24,693
as if talking to herself

563
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:28,727
Since everyone detested Ling

564
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,331
no one paid any attention to her

565
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,971
Some villagers threw water on her

566
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,235
to drive her away

567
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:42,242
Around midnight, a big fire erupted

568
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,719
and kept burning till noon the next day

569
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,154
Among the deceased
300 were burnt beyond recognition

570
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:50,918
How exactly did Ling die?

571
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,452
She hanged herself

572
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,261
Ling killed herself the day after the big fire

573
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,546
ls Mrs. Chui alright?

574
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:15,705
She's fine

575
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,945
So you too believed that she wasn't insane,

576
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:23,315
but that she only sawthings no one else could

577
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:26,456
She foresaw a big disaster

578
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:27,720
and tried to warn everyone

579
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:29,088
but no one listened to her

580
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,826
l don't understand any of this spiritual stuff

581
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,395
l just want you two to knowthat

582
01:14:35,136 --> 01:14:37,900
Ling was a very kind person...

583
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,037
and she had a tough life

584
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:45,336
Can l take a look at Ling's room?

585
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,029
Tonight...

586
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:09,628
...l want to stay here

587
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,966
l'll take you to Ling's grave tomorrow morning

588
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:17,409
You've been very kind to us, thank you

589
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,277
You should go to bed now

590
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,415
Alright, l'll stay next door

591
01:15:24,652 --> 01:15:25,846
Shout if anything happens

592
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,724
l know
you've wanted me to come here all this time

593
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,127
Well, here I am now

594
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:42,829
What do you want to tell me?

595
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:15,696
...ill-fated...ill-fated...

596
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:20,225
Hurry...take her to the hospital!

597
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:23,264
Get lost...

598
01:17:23,638 --> 01:17:28,132
You should be ashamed of yourself...

599
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,535
You are a curse!

600
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:43,316
Told you not to come here!

601
01:17:43,591 --> 01:17:47,925
She's evil! Don't ever play with her!

602
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:58,670
Go save him! Save my boy...

603
01:17:58,906 --> 01:18:02,307
Help him... Make him breathe...

604
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:03,770
What have you done to my boy...

605
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:05,442
You little bitch! Go to hell...

606
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,147
She's evil!

607
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:11,146
Stay away from my house! Get lost!

608
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:13,479
Be reasonable!

609
01:18:13,788 --> 01:18:16,052
My daughter is only trying to help...

610
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:20,119
Go away!

611
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:21,049
Mrs. Chui, l know howto help Ling

612
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:22,381
let's go upstairs to see her

613
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,922
Her most painful time was not in the past

614
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,319
it's right now!

615
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:28,054
Since she killed herself,

616
01:19:28,262 --> 01:19:30,662
she's been trapped in a time warp...
constantly repeating her suicide

617
01:19:31,165 --> 01:19:32,496
She was dead

618
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,902
How can someone who's dead die again?

619
01:19:35,536 --> 01:19:36,969
Listen to me

620
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,635
very soon she'll appear upstairs

621
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,175
Let's go up to see her!

622
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:45,706
l won't see her!

623
01:19:47,248 --> 01:19:48,943
l spent my whole life protecting her

624
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:51,708
l never once gave up on her,

625
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:56,579
but she gave up on herself!

626
01:19:56,924 --> 01:19:58,915
For that l can never forgive her!

627
01:20:05,466 --> 01:20:06,797
Just listen,

628
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:09,328
I'm sure you hear this sound every night

629
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:13,330
Ling died at 3'o clock, didn't she?

630
01:20:23,551 --> 01:20:26,884
Mrs. Chui, come with me and you'll understand!

631
01:20:27,188 --> 01:20:28,951
I'm not going upstairs!

632
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:27,410
Mom...

633
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:32,215
Help me...

634
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,651
Help me...

635
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:38,223
Ling?

636
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,492
Help me...

637
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,005
Help me!

638
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:26,266
Help me...help me...

639
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,737
ls it Ling?

640
01:22:28,175 --> 01:22:30,040
ls it really Ling?

641
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,809
Mom...

642
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,486
Help me...

643
01:22:40,187 --> 01:22:43,156
Ling, you were the one who left me...

644
01:22:45,526 --> 01:22:51,192
you were the one who left me...

645
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:53,390
Mom...

646
01:22:53,601 --> 01:22:56,502
Help me...

647
01:23:01,976 --> 01:23:05,207
Mom...

648
01:23:05,913 --> 01:23:08,108
Ling, Mommy is coming!

649
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:12,046
Ling! Ling!

650
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:20,519
My girl, mommy's right here

651
01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:22,919
Don't be afraid

652
01:23:24,832 --> 01:23:27,665
No one can bully you anymore

653
01:23:28,102 --> 01:23:32,334
Mom, I'm so sorry

654
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:35,708
I was wrong

655
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,777
Please forgive me!

656
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,243
I've already forgiven you

657
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:02,291
Mun!

658
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:04,964
What happened?

659
01:24:06,407 --> 01:24:07,772
Are you alright?

660
01:27:37,484 --> 01:27:39,679
Go that way! Move over...

661
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:42,813
Hurry! Pull him out!

662
01:27:43,023 --> 01:27:45,491
Careful! Come on keep pulling...

663
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:57,728
Over there! Move!

664
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:33,096
Get out!

665
01:29:33,734 --> 01:29:36,726
Get out!

666
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:38,268
Something's happening, get out, quick!

667
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,870
Granny, leave your house now!

668
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:41,630
Leave your house now!

669
01:29:45,045 --> 01:29:46,808
Brother, run for your life!

670
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:49,073
Get out! Quick! Run!

671
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,511
Get out! Run...

672
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,748
Run! Run for your life!

673
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:58,756
Run! Run for your life!

674
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:05,724
Run! A disaster is coming!

675
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,183
Run! Run now!

676
01:30:29,423 --> 01:30:30,321
What's she saying?

677
01:30:30,524 --> 01:30:31,718
Run! Get out!

678
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:01,078
Mun!

679
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:03,812
Go, go, go...Move over...

680
01:31:15,969 --> 01:31:18,062
Go, go, go...Move over...

681
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,487
...Listen to me...

682
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:54,694
Mun...

683
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:02,920
Ever since that day, Ling never appears again

684
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:05,322
I hold no resentment towards her...

685
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:09,758
Since l saw
and experienced the same pain that she did.

686
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:13,000
But aside from pain

687
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:16,535
I saw beauty

688
01:35:17,377 --> 01:35:20,346
I no longer question why am l blind

689
01:35:21,014 --> 01:35:22,276
lt is becasue

690
01:35:22,582 --> 01:35:25,642
I've already seen
the most beautiful things in this world

691
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:28,884
Things l'll never forget
