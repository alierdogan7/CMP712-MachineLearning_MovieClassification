The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:07,285
I was part of a 10-person team
at the Human Genome Project,

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:09,805
I believe we can take out every last
dead one of them.

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:11,164
Fire with fire.

5
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:12,707
We found a short bus out back.

6
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:15,788
- Now that we can take a breath...
- We take a breath, we slow down...

7
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:19,817
We all need to leave to DC, right now.

8
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,791
We saved you.

9
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:24,082
Well, I am trying to save yours.
Save everyone's.

10
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:26,726
Stay and help us. And we will go with you.

found some cars,

and they're just down the road.

47
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,051

68
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,446

69
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,715
when it comes to
air-transmissible pathogens.

70
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,692
Why the hair?

71
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:19,027
Because I like it.

72
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,230
And no one is takin'

73
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:23,366

For showing up.

202
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,889
It took a little horse
trading to get you here,

203

but it's plain
as potatoes to me now.

204

You get it.

205
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,496
Coulda lit out after the crash,

206

made a case, but you stayed.

You gonna put that thing

How about that?
You gonna wrap that up?

No, I'm gonna
let it get some air.

212
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:44,526

Yeah.

214

Gotten to the point where
everyone alive is strong now.

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,140
We have to be.

216
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,843
You're either strong and they
can help you so you help them

which isn't to say it's their thing.
It's not mine either.

245

It's just that I enjoy
the female form

246
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:10,279

a victimless crime

247
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:12,446

comfort and distraction.

- Don't know about that.
- You did.

254
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,135
Well, if I did, then you provided
the context for me doing so.

255
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:34,005
- What?
- I was screwed either way,

256
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,443
so I went with the choice
that helped someone.

257
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,544
I thought it trite,
but it turned out to be true.

258

- Point to you.
- You have this.

259
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,886

before, you do.

I'm the same way.

Uh, did you hear
what I just said?

263
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,865
The bus crashed 'cause of me.

264
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,069
- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did.

265
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:05,240

It wasn't supposed to go down
like that, not hardly, not half.

270
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,355
The glass wasn't supposed
to wear out the fuel line

271
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,521
next to the spark plugs.

272
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:23,391

on the perversion,

279
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:48,957
but I know empirically and definitively
I cannot survive on my own.

280
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,428
- I cannot.
- So you killed the bus?

281

If I don't cure the disease,

282
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,475
if I don't save the world,
I have no value.

283
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:02,212
- That's not how it works.
- If I don't fix things,

284
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,614
there's no way you people
would keep me around,

285

share resources,
even protect me.

286
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,789
Of course we would.

doing a sweep for supplies.

356
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:34,878
We'll sweep as we go.

357
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,348
We've done it since Houston.
We're not stopping now.

358
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,651
You heard the lady.

359
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:45,519
We're taking it north.

360
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:47,755
Tara:
We tapped out the toilet.

361
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:50,424
Broad River is five miles west.

362
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:53,896
At the very least, we stock up
there before we find wheels.

363
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:55,531
We got a vehicle.

364
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,772
And it just so happens...

365
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:03,676
<i>it's got 500 gallons</i>
<i>of water on it.</i>

366
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:20,728
(humming)

367
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,437
(grunts)

368
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,140
(humming continues)

369
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:39,312
<i>(engine whirring)</i>

370
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:48,124
<i>(engine starts)</i>

371
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,294
(laughs)

372
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:53,200
About time things
started going our way!

373
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,114
<i>(engine knocks, stops)</i>

374
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:19,819
Come on.

375
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,452
Just once.

376
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:25,124
One damn time.

377
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,629
We'll find another ride.

378
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:31,368
If there was a ride worth a shit
in this town, we'd have seen it.

379
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,037
This thing's done
some crowd clearing.

380
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,003
Right up into the intake.

381
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:39,338
Which means we've got an air filter
filled with damn human remains.

382
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:45,344
And there is no damned corner
on this damned Earth

383
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:48,616
that has not been dicked hard

384
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,819
beyond all damned recognition.

385
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,353
- Abraham?
- What?

386
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:57,125
That feeds the radiator. The intake for
the engine is actually on the roof.

387
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:11,506
<i>(tire thumps)</i>

388
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:15,077
(snarling)

389
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,149
Tara, Maggie!

390
00:28:17,151 --> 00:28:19,921
One damn time!

391
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:25,592
- One damn time!
- Rosita:<i> Abraham, just wait!</i>

392
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:29,063
(snarling continues)

393
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:31,233
There's more from the back!

394
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:47,623
(growling)

395
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:13,652
<i>(faint growling)</i>

396
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:16,054
I been to eight county fairs

397
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:18,795
and one goat rodeo.

398
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:21,265
I never seen anything like that.

399
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,741
There was a Goodwill
over there by the bookstore.

400
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:31,646
It's pretty blown up, but there might be
some supplies, some dry clothes, maybe?

401
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,782
Not necessary.

402
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:37,119
I can clear that intake
in two shakes.

403
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,655
Then the engine
will get some wind

404
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:41,726
and so will we.

405
00:29:41,728 --> 00:29:43,795
You'll air-dry.

406
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:45,896
We roll on.

407
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:52,937
(laughing)

408
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,281
What?

409
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,715
This shit is screwed up!

410
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,951
(laughing)

411
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:21,360
<i>(water dripping)</i>

412
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:25,731

413
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,474
Ellen?

414
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,381
AJ?

415
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,483
Becca?!

416
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,094
(yells) Ellen!

417
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:52,266
Ellen!

418
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,968
(humming)

419
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:58,341
- <i> (clanking)</i>
- Come on.

420
00:30:58,343 --> 00:31:01,140
<i>(humming continues)</i>

421
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:07,682
<i>(clanking continues)</i>

422
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:35,002
I know why you have the haircut.

423
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:36,869
I told you,
it's 'cause I like it.

424
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:39,808
I believe that.
I like it, too.

425
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,379
I think you like it
for a reason.

426
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:50,785
You're not the person
people think you are.

427
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:52,653
You want 'em
to know who you are.

428
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:58,728
Not following you.

429
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,395
If you didn't have that mullet,

430
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:03,531
you'd probably be like
everybody else in the labs.

431
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:07,637
But you're not
like everybody else.

432
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,208
I think a lot of people
in your position

433
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,410
probably woulda given up,

434
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:12,979
but you didn't.

435
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:16,683
There were people-- a lot
of them along the way--

436
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,485
they made sure I didn't give up.

437
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,387
It wasn't me remotely.

438
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:23,260
It was.

439
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:26,231
You started this thing.

440
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:29,569
And you're not like Samson.
He was kind of a mess.

441
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,439
Not following you.

442
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:34,275
Well, his story goes...

443
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:36,779
that one day
when a lion attacked him,

444
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:39,580
God gave him strength
and he tore it apart.

445
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,049
Then he goes back one day,
he's by himself,

446
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:46,120
and he sees that bees have
made a hive in the carcass.

447
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:48,355
So later he tells
this riddle to people.

448
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,625
"Out of the eater,
something to eat.

449
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:54,929
Out of the strong,
something sweet."

450
00:32:54,931 --> 00:33:00,131
And I always thought, "How the hell are
people supposed to know the answer

451
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,599
when it's just
about his own life?

452
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:06,535
When the only place the answer
is is in his own head?"

453
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,769
Glenn:
<i>Whoa, what the hell is that?</i>

454
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:12,772
What?

455
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:15,075
Wind's picking up.
You're about to smell it.

456
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,376
- <i> (all groan)</i>
- Maggie:<i> What is that?</i>

457
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,813
Whatever's making that stench,

458
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:22,118
it ain't nothin' nice.

459
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:26,823
We're not stoppin'.

460
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:29,491
Uh, we're stopped.

461
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:41,305
<i>(locusts chirping)</i>

462
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:45,846
<i>(wind rustling)</i>

(coughs)

464
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:25,683
Let's go.

465
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:27,949
- Yeah.
- Abraham:<i> I will not lie down.</i>

466
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,155
Abraham.

467
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:32,922
(softly) I will not abase.

468
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:35,857
Abraham, let's get out of here.

469
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:38,494
I will not give up the ship.

470
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:43,831
(normal volume) Hold up.

471
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,534
- Maggie: We gotta go.
- No.

472
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:50,070
No, we don't.

473
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:52,638
They can't hear us
and they can't see us.

474
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,205
Not from here.

475
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:56,240
We're fine.

476
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:58,542
Tara: Yeah, this is the
definition of fine."

477
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:00,512
Glenn: <i>We need the map.
There's gotta be a detour.</i>

478
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,647
I'm not doing it.

479
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:04,816
We detoured and detoured and
detoured from Houston to Georgia.

480
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:07,218
I'm not playing
that game anymore.

481
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,055
We are not going
through this, okay?

482
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:11,491
It isn't gonna happen.

483
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:12,993
You got a shitstorm
behind door A

484
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:15,330
and a storm of shit
behind door B.

485
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:18,766
If you're lucky, it's
walkers or a shot-up truck.

486
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:21,037
But sooner or later
you get cornered.

487
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,075
You wind up stayin'
and you wind up killin'.

488
00:35:24,077 --> 00:35:27,845
We don't go back.
We can't go back.

489
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:29,947
I'm not talking
about going back.

490
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:32,750
- Just south a few miles.
- No.

491
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:35,019
Eugene: We already hit a full
stop 'cause of an air filter

492
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:37,351
compromised by innards.

493
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,086
That will happen again.

494
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:40,886
Then we'll hit 'em
with the hose.

495
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,622
Rosita: The tank
is empty, Abraham.

496
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:46,225
- If we floor it--
- We still hit them, they still slow us down,

497
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,627
and then they stop us.

498
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:49,128
I'm not saying
we just go straight.

499
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,629
That's the way the road goes.

500
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,364
- Abraham!
- We can get through!

501
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:54,632
I know it!

502
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:58,068
And that means
we are not going south,

503
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,904
going around, or going back!

504
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:03,175
Rosita:
<i>No.</i>

505
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,148
They're right.

506
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:24,635
- Rosita: Hey, Abraham.
- Glenn: Hey! Hey!

507
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:27,039
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Glenn: Let go of him.

508
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,475
Rosita: <i>I'm not gonna
let you do this.</i>

509
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,341
- Yes, you are.
- Hey, hey, stop.

510
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:32,476
- Get out.
- Hey, you are done! You're done!

511
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:34,179
- Do not! Do not!
- Stop!

512
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:37,816
I told you, you do not touch me!
You do not touch me!

513
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:41,687
- Abraham!
- (all shouting)

514
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:42,954
Rosita:
<i>Abraham!</i>

515
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:44,156
I'm not a scientist!

516
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,929
I'm not a scientist!

517
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,108
I lied.
I'm not a scientist.

518
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:59,782
I don't know how to stop it.

519
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,985
I'm not a scientist.

520
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:33,278
You are a scientist. I've seen
the things that you can do.

521
00:37:34,347 --> 00:37:36,137
I just know things.

522
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:41,620
You just...
"know things"?

523
00:37:41,622 --> 00:37:44,068
I know I'm smarter
than most people,

524
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:46,326
I know I'm a very good liar,

525
00:37:46,328 --> 00:37:48,428
and I know I needed
to get to DC.

526
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:50,797
Why?

527
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:55,102
Because I do believe that locale holds
the strongest possibility for survival,

528
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:58,238
and I wanted to survive.

529
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,273
If I could cheat some people
into taking me there,

530
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:04,444
well, I just reasoned that
I'd be doin' them a solid, too,

531
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,348
<i>considering the perilous state</i>
<i>of the city of Houston,</i>

532
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,352
<i>the state of everything.</i>

533
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:19,558
People died
trying to get you here.

534
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,369
I'm aware of that--

535
00:38:22,371 --> 00:38:26,973
Stephanie, Warren, Pam,

536
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:31,344
Rex, Roger, Josiah,
Dirk, and Josephine.

537
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,480
And Bob.

538
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,545
You see, I lost my nerve
as we grew closer,

539
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:43,714
(voice breaks)
for I am a coward...

540
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:46,383
and the reality of
getting to our destination

541
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:47,717
and disclosing
e truth of the matter

542
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:50,553
became some
truly frightening shit.

543
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:52,789
I took it upon myself
to slow our roll.

544
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:57,761
Find time to finesse things
so then when we got there...

545
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:02,431
But at this moment,
I fully realize

546
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:04,503
there are no longer
any agreeable options.

547
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:09,006
I was screwed either way.

548
00:39:15,649 --> 00:39:17,649
I also lied about T. Brooks
Ellis liking my hair.

549
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,683
I do not know
T. Brooks Ellis.

550
00:39:19,685 --> 00:39:22,054
<i>But I did read one of his
books, and he seemed like</i>

551
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:24,921
the type of guy that wouldn't blink
twice at a Tennessee Top Hat.

552
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:32,962
Again...

553
00:39:32,964 --> 00:39:34,929
I am smarter than you.

554
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,131
Now, you may want
to leave me here--

555
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:37,701
- (gun clatters)
- (grunts)

556
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:39,803
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, come on!

557
00:39:39,805 --> 00:39:42,872
- Get off of him!
- (roars)

558
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:47,275
- Maggie:<i> Oh, my God.</i>
- Glenn: No.

559
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:51,814
Maggie:
Eugene?

560
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:12,071
<i>Get up.</i>
<i>Look at me.</i>

561
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,747
Oh, my God.

562
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,989
Oh, God.
Eugene, are you there?

563
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,093
<i>Eugene!</i>

564
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:28,697
<i>Eugene!</i>

565
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:33,137
<i>Eugene!</i>

566
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:41,278
<i>Eugene...?</i>

567
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,015
<i>Come on!</i>

568
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,349
Abraham:
<i>Ellen.</i>

569
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,541
(dog tags rattle)

570
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:20,511
<i>(tags clatter)</i>

571
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:28,081
Eugene:
<i>Help me!</i>

572
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,850
(snarling, growling)

573
00:41:29,852 --> 00:41:32,487
Help!
Help me!

574
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:38,127
(whimpers)

575
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,930
Help me, please!

576
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,997
It's them.
Get 'em!

577
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,266
(growling)

578
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:52,607
Get them.
Get 'em.

579
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:55,112
Thank you.

580
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:56,948
Thank you.

581
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,384
I think-- I think
they're gettin' faster.

582
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,855
<i>Wait!</i>

583
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,623
Wait up!

584
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,391
Stop!

585
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:13,130
- <i> You can't leave!</i>
- Why?

586
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:22,269
I have a very important mission.

587
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:31,941
