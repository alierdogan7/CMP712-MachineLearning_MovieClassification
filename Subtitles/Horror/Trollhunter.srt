00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,439
In October 13, 2008, Filmkameratene
AS got an anonymous package-

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,999
-With two hard drives that contained
283 minutes of filmed material.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,239
This film is a rough cut version
of the material.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,039
Everything is displayed in chronological order.
The pictures are not manipulated.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,559
For over a year they sought to find out
on whether it is a scam-

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,919
Or if the material is genuine.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,839
It was concluded that
the material is genuine.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,719
Of course.
Turn on the radio.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,839
-Johanna, do you have sound?
-Yes, yes.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,279
It does not work.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,679
Late last night,
bear tracks was found in Volda.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,799
A hunting team came early today
to trap the bear.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,079
The leader of the team said this
to NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corp.)

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,479
There is a bear
that we must quickly get a hold of.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,359
But our major concerns is a
sniper who followed after us.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,359
Only a slected few has a
Bear Hunting Licence

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,839
I know all bear hunters in Norway.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,719
He, with the Land Rover,
is definitely not a bear hunter.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,159
If he shoots the bear
He does something illegal.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,239
-Have you seen him?
-We see him everywhere.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,279
If I see him again
it will have consequences.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,639
I think it is
a regular poacher.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,959
-What would you tell him?
-To put the cards on the table.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,479
Now!

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,919
-There are cars coming from all directions.
-We lost him!

26
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,799
Ready?

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,479
We only know that his name is Hans.
We do not know his last name.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,759
You need to be more serious.

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,199
But what is he doing in Volda?
Who is man?

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,959
-Any sound?
-You have not inserted it...

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,079
You get no interview
with a fucking sniper.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,279
I do not like that they are
making fun of him.

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,639
Great! Many thanks. Goodbye.

34
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,639
Thomas, he says the guy is
staying at the campsite!

35
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,999
I can not say that I know
him, but he lives here.

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,719
He lives over there.
Should I show you?

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,599
I do not know what stinks,
but it stinks of something awful.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,559
-What is this?
-I do not know.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,519
Thyme?

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,239
He drives off and is gone until the sun
goes up. Then he is back in place.

41
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,279
Is he out there all night?
-Yes. Always.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,039
-In a good mood?
-Yes.

43
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,799
We do not know when he will
arrive if he does.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,919
-There he is!
-The camera is rolling. Just ask him.

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,879
Hi, my name is Thomas.
We are from the college in Volda.

46
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,119
Can we ask some questions?

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,239
Get out of here.

48
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,399
Can we come back later...

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,439
-Did you get anything?
-Quiet, I hear something.

50
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,679
I'm on my way out now.

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,719
I expect to find it tonight.
All right. Goodbye.

52
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,839
-He is not here.
-He was just in front of us!

53
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,279
Yes, but...

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,999
-Damn!
-Good job, Thomas.

55
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,879
-Are you filming? Do you see anything?
-Yes.

56
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,719
Some fur stuff hanging from the ceiling.

57
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
And it is a shotgun there.

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,919
We are heading to a place where
this morning they found a shot bear.

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,239
Could it be him
who shot the bear?

60
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,119
Where it comes from,
I have no idea.

61
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,879
I have checked with all
registered bear hunters.

62
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,159
No one has shot the bear.

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,919
All bear management in Norway
is strictly controlled by the state.

64
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,319
It will be a bloody commotion
when a bear is shot like this.

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,999
Come here.

66
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,159
These tracks do not match
with the way a bear goes.

67
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,999
I think someone brought the bear
and placed it here.

68
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,119
-That is just weird.
-I agree.

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,999
You are from the Game Board?
You are Finn Haugan?

70
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,679
The hunters say they do not think
these are bear tracks.

71
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,999
Ridiculous.
What tracks are they then?

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,919
There is a bear laying there,
with bear tracks behind it.

73
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,919
-Why do you think they doubt?
-Ask them. Totally insane.

74
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,479
Now we have been waiting for hours on Hans.
He seems to have something going on.

75
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,319
We're pretty sure that
He is on the way somewhere.

76
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,159
Go!

77
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,239
He is going with the ferry.

78
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,319
How long do you think
we'll keep on with this?

79
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,359
Farewell, Volda City.

80
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,919
Do you see what it is?

81
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,759
He carries a car tire.

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,799
-What is he doing?
-He disappears down.

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,679
Three, two, one and...

84
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,799
Sogn og Fjordane!
(County border)

85
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,199
Okay, he's standing over there.

86
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,159
Hide.

87
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,639
We met earlier.

88
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,599
-Really?
-Thomas, from College of Volda.

89
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,719
-Is it...
-Are you following after me?

90
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,919
No. We just want
ask some questions.

91
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,679
No.

92
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,279
Are you ...
What did you do in Volda, anyway?

93
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,319
Was it you who shot the bear?

94
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,079
Stay away from me!

95
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,919
Stop filming. Leave me alone!

96
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,039
When we got what we need
we can go back.

97
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,479
It's going to be insanely good
if we get him to talk.

98
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,879
We have tried several times.

99
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,759
Do you think Michael Moore
gave up after the first attempt?

100
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,919
Left arm or right foot?
Kickfoot and...

101
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,159
Now we've been here
the whole afternoon.

102
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,199
He is still in the caravan.
I guess he is asleep.

103
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,559
We must be patient
and wait for something to happen.

104
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,199
Are you kidding? All right.

105
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,159
I need to bring
the sound equipment.

106
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,199
What is this?

107
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,439
"Road closed. Blasting in progress."

108
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,119
Did you see that? Was it a road?
Did you?

109
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,079
Really bad roads.

110
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,239
If there are any inbred pig farmers
there, your ass is first.

111
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,999
-I'm not...
-Stop complaining.

112
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,999
-May I not say what I think?
-Should we go back?

113
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,199
-We can sidestep the whole thing.
-No!

114
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,639
Wait!

115
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,839
Look.

116
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,559
I do not think he's in the car.

117
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,679
-Then we know that he is here.
-But what is he doing?

118
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,359
Here is a path.

119
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,279
-I hear something far away.
-What is that?

120
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,319
Troll!

121
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,279
Thomas!

122
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,119
Hurry!
I have the car here!

123
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,239
I was fucking bitten!

124
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,359
-Are you ok?
-Damn it hurts.

125
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,479
-Did you hear that he called "troll"?
-Shut up.

126
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,039
You need more.

127
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,719
-Should I do something?
-Get a swab.

128
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,039
-Do not do that...
-We have to lift a bit of this.

129
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,679
You look like hell, Thomas.

130
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,319
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Tetanus.

131
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,399
Hans, you shouted something in the woods,
right?

132
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,359
-You heard it, Johanna.
-What is this slime?

133
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,439
-What did he say?
-Kalle...

134
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,479
-More?
-I'm good.

135
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,399
-Can you drive us to our car?
-Get In.

136
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,679
It is not so smart
to follow me.

137
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,159
You shouted "troll"?

138
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,519
-Is it your car?
-What the hell is this?

139
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,839
-What happened?
-It's our car!

140
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,559
Somebody smashed the car.

141
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,359
It is toally destroyed.

142
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,199
Look here, Thomas.

143
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,319
-Hans, do you understand anything of this?
-Yes, I have some ideas.

144
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,919
That's no bear
who did this?

145
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,159
What do you think has happened?

146
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,919
Ask if it's trolls.

147
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,639
If you know what happened
with the car, tell us!

148
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,559
-You yelled "troll" in the woods.
-Forget about it!

149
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,039
What the hell do you want?

150
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,879
Would you film me
when I say there are trolls?

151
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,599
-Is it funny?
-You do not think that there are...?

152
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,599
I'm going now. If you want a lift
you have to come now.

153
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,879
What do we do?

154
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,839
Do you have the luggage?

155
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:17,319
Just so we understand you:
So you think that there are trolls?

156
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,559
Do you think
that it was a bear that bit you?

157
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,959
What's happening? Why are you stopping?

158
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,439
Thanks for the ride.

159
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,639
We would like to come with you
and film what you do.

160
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,159
We really want to.

161
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,359
You can film when I kill the thing that
nibbled on you, on one condition:

162
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,279
You must do as I say,
whatever I say. Okay?

163
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,359
Yes.

164
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,879
It feels like I'm bleeding everywhere.

165
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,839
-Admiring your wound?
-It looks a bit cool.

166
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
-You are sick in the head.
-I mean it.

167
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,719
-Why should we call them?
-To tell us where we are.

168
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,839
He is not so dangerous,
He is just strange.

169
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,519
Remember what he said.
He run the show. We do as he says.

170
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,679
So we get what we need.

171
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,719
Is there anyone here
who believe in God or Jesus?

172
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
No, none of us.

173
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,559
Do not look at me.

174
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,039
Seriously? They can smell the blood
of a christian man?

175
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,959
Is it okay?

176
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,199
Go and close the gate. Hang the sign
in the middle, so it is visible.

177
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,599
-Is this a land mine?
-Yes, but it is not loaded.

178
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,919
Am I sitting on a land mine?
Are you crazy?

179
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,799
Anyone who does not want to
go up in the woods?

180
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,679
Anyone who changed their mind?
Anyone who is afraid of troll?

181
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,359
-No.
-Good.

182
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,839
There is a creek there. Take of all
your clothing and wash yourselves properly.

183
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,039
-Especially the armpits and crotch.
-No!

184
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,039
-Why?
-To get rid of any smell.

185
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,439
Then anoint your whole body with
this. On the clothes too.

186
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,079
-What is it?
-Troll stench.

187
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,199
-Apply on the whole body.
-Are you kidding? It stinks!

188
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,199
You have to smell like troll,
otherwise they smell us and run off.

189
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,559
Damn!

190
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,999
-I said no!
-I do not want to, Thomas.

191
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,639
No, I said!

192
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,839
You were supposed to do exactly what I said.

193
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,679
Otherwise I go alone,
and you get to stay here.

194
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,719
Do you understand?

195
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,599
Are you ready?
Have you smeared it on?

196
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,679
You are very cute.

197
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,799
Here are flashlights.

198
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,359
-What is that?
-A big flash, really.

199
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,399
Hans? How do you use the weapon?

200
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,479
It shoots a
strong ultraviolet light.

201
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,799
UVB rays. Same as in the sun,
or in a tanning bed.

202
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,399
You know nothing, Thomas?
They are petrified by sunshine.

203
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,719
-Yes. Or they burst.
-Haven't you read anything?

204
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,159
Well, I heard the stories when I was
little, but... - Did you know, Kalle?

205
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,159
If a troll wants to have an
eating race with you then?

206
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,639
Eating race?

207
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,719
Asbjornsen and Moe's tales
does not mirror reality.

208
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,559
I think they fit pretty good.

209
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,119
Troll-Piss.
Oh, God!

210
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,199
It stinks all the way over here.

211
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,239
I'm chasing a Ringlefinch.
There is piss everywhere in the forest.

212
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,879
Seems as if he had been chased away.
He marks new territory.

213
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,199
He does not seem entirely healthy.
Would love to know what the problem is.

214
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,439
Blood sample from the troll?
I have no equipment for that.

215
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,879
You too. Goodbye.

216
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,959
I need help to find out what
the problem is.

217
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,199
But blood tests...
It will be difficult.

218
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,919
-Who did you talk to?
-A veterinarian.

219
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,039
Veterinary!

220
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,839
Wait here, I will find the troll
and chase it out.

221
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,639
Oh well. Did you expect this?

222
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,839
It certainly takes some time.

223
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,679
It is a bit sorry for him
if he truly believes in trolls.

224
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,319
He might film us.

225
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,999
-It's probably what he is doing.
-Sitting and laughing at us.

226
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,559
We are so stupid
that we sit up here and...

227
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,839
Lingonberry?

228
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,279
-We are in the woods.
-Yes, completely without food and drink.

229
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,439
-Cool!
-What?

230
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,479
It's this night vision.

231
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,079
Listen!

232
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,599
It is only he who...

233
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,999
One week,
or be bitten by a bear.

234
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,519
-That is a better story.
-You look pretty good.

235
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,359
-So I think I choose that.
-Be bitten by a bear?

236
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,039
Do you hear?

237
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,679
What strange sound.

238
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,599
What is that?

239
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,559
Seriously. There's something happening.

240
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,839
What is going on?

241
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,639
It's just a crap joke.

242
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,559
It's a bloody Tosserladd!
Move!

243
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,759
Run for fuck sake!

244
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,839
Quick!

245
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,079
Thomas! Thomas!

246
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
-Did you see it?
-Yes.

247
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,199
Where did it go?
Have you seen it?

248
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,719
Hey!

249
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,159
Hide behind the car!

250
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,879
No!

251
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,759
-Give me the camera!
-No!

252
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,599
Where's Johanna?

253
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,559
Johanna!

254
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,359
Thomas! Kalle!

255
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,559
-Johanna!
-It was real!

256
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,759
I saw it!
I knew it!

257
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,159
They are for real!

258
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,199
-Say something then.
-It's petrified!

259
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,999
We ran through the woods...

260
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,919
Why the hell did you say
that none of you were a Christian?

261
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,359
Did you see how the troll sniffed?
One of you believe in God.

262
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,599
I do not believe in God, but I was
in a Christian children's choir.

263
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,639
But it was my parents
who said I had to.

264
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,359
I do not believe in God.
Seriously.

265
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,319
-It's not her. I can tell.
-What do you mean?

266
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,439
Knock it off with the bullshit! It is
some gene manipulated fucked up shit.

267
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,319
-It's a troll.
-It's not a troll!

268
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,639
Why is there no one else
who knows about this?

269
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,919
Some people want it to be
a secret.

270
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,439
The state?

271
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,479
Does the State keep this secret?
Do you work for the State?

272
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,759
-Why would you show us this now?
-It is a fucking crappy job.

273
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,719
I have no safety.
I have no night-ons.

274
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,519
No overtime
and no additional pay.

275
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,879
Perhaps the time has come for
changes in  troll management.

276
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,839
-Maybe if you get it on TV...
-I think we can fix that.

277
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,119
Come on.

278
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,079
If you want to see more of these
animals it is okay with me.

279
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,879
I would watch out a bit
if I were you.

280
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
God Damn!

281
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,159
Here's dirt
if someone is filling a hole.

282
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,799
What the hell is that?

283
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,799
-Who is coming?
-Do not know.

284
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,599
Hello, hello.

285
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,599
The guy we were filming...

286
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,319
What are you doing, Hans?
Do you have a film crew here?

287
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,439
They wanted to see trolls,
so I show them some.

288
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,359
We have interviewed him before.
- Aren't you from the Game Board?

289
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,359
It was an exceptionally bad idea.

290
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,319
Turn off the camera.
I have enough problems.

291
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,719
Lots of dead cows in the valley.

292
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,039
We can not talk when they're shooting.
Turn off the camera. Now!

293
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,559
-Turn it off now.
-We have the right to film here.

294
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,919
-Are you starting to lose your grip?
-I have complete control.

295
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,159
As soon as they come up with the
scapegoat, I'll fix the rest.

296
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,559
Hello, Finn. How are you?

297
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,439
Are you good? Are you very good?
We have driven a long way.

298
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,199
-Are you filming? Are you filming?
-Yes.

299
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,799
Very good, very fresh!

300
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,199
-This is not a Scandinavian bear.
-No, it is from Croatia!

301
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,399
To the Scandinavian bear it's very close
No problem, Finn!

302
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,959
Hello!

303
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,759
It's very fresh.

304
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,559
We must break.
My back!

305
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,919
Put it over there.

306
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,039
It is very good.

307
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,879
35 000.
Bad bear, bad price.

308
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,879
The Riglefinch is still up in the woods.

309
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,919
Find it then!

310
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,519
A pair of German tourists
disappeared last night.

311
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,879
-Some more will probably follow.
-It's not my problem.

312
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,839
If you think you may keep
recordings...You are wrong!

313
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,679
He is best at finding bear.

314
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,359
This bear is from zoo.
Zoo you know?

315
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,999
-Why does Finn buy bears?
-I do not know!

316
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,759
In Poland, we don't ask.

317
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,079
Why create problems when
don't want to have problems?

318
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,079
-Bye!
-Bye.

319
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,439
It says "Pioters painting service."

320
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,399
Honestly, what is your job?

321
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,799
To kill all the trolls who gets
out from their territories.

322
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,679
And closer to people.
-How often does it happen?

323
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,599
Very rarely. Now it has emerged
a special situation.

324
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,679
Many trolls have broken out
and wander around the area.

325
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,399
Finn, he is a bureaucrat....

326
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,599
He leads the TSS.
He shall prevent-

327
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,319
-That people know
that there is trolls in the woods.

328
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,919
In a way, you are
one of Norway's greatest heroes.

329
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,879
No, you're wrong there.

330
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,879
There is no heroism in the job.
It is dirty rough work.

331
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,479
How is it
that no one knows about this?

332
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,639
We go to Oslo and sell the
recordings expensive to NRK.

333
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,239
It is not related yet.
We just have to follow him.

334
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,559
Finn is pissed off.

335
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,119
-Where are we going now?
-Now it's breakfast.

336
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,319
-You should get some food.
-I'm not that hungry.

337
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,639
I feel a little half ill.

338
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,359
How many kinds of trolls are there?

339
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,359
There are two main groups:
mountain trolls and woodland trolls.

340
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,839
Of the subgroups, there are
Ringlefinch, Tosserlad, Rimetosser.

341
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,079
And Dovrehubby.

342
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,119
-Harding is a kind from Western Norway.
-But the monster we saw...

343
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,839
-They all have three heads?
-No, it's different.

344
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,799
They develop heads
through their lifecycle.

345
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,559
They are not born with three heads.

346
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,959
They are usually born with one;
then others grow out.

347
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,639
They only have eyes in the middle
head. The original head.

348
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,359
The others are not really heads.
They are just formations

349
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,279
-Which resemble heads
to scare other trolls.

350
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,599
Or make an impression on female troll.

351
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,439
What is the schedule?

352
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,319
-TSS. What does it stand for?
-Troll Security Service.

353
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,199
Every time we followed a troll
we need to complete this.

354
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:25,039
Where it was, sex, if it bursted
or was petrified...

355
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,319
In Asbjornsen and Moe-tales
trolls have clothes on-

356
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,399
And they talk to people.

357
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,719
-They are like people.
-You can just forget about fairy tales.

358
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,439
Trolls are animals. Predators.

359
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,479
They eat, shit and mate.
They eat everything they come across.

360
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,399
-How old can they be?
-1000, 1200 years.

361
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,519
-How is the level of intelligence?
-Very low. They are stupid.

362
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,519
They manage to ingest food. But how
difficult it is when they eat stones?

363
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,559
I saw a troll
who tried to eat its tail.

364
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,279
Stood with his head between his legs,
and tried to swallow its own tail.

365
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,959
When he had pretty much swallowed it-

366
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,119
-He fell and rolled
down the mountain like a wheel.

367
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,039
-I was a commando.
-Is that how you got into this?

368
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,999
No, they were looking for a person
who could...

369
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,719
-Are you the only one in Norway?
-Yes.

370
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,959
Are we going?

371
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,759
-They eat all kind of crap.
-They eat people?

372
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,639
-Try it yourself.
-No, but they have been eating people?

373
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:18,599
-Is it troll tails?
-Yes. Some are skinned, others are whole.

374
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,159
-Why?
-To make it smell troll.

375
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,039
Why should it smell troll?

376
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,999
I must be getting close
troll without them noticing me.

377
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,679
Solarium-Lamp?
-Yes.

378
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,639
-You can get skin cancer.
-I use sunscreen.

379
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,879
I have problems sleeping
in the dark.

380
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,439
-We smeared ourselves with that?
-Yes.

381
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,919
-What is it?
Concentrated troll stench.

382
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,599
A mixture of all the crap
you can squeeze out of a troll.

383
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,759
We must find the Ringlefinch before
he eat his way through every barn here.

384
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,639
The German tourists were found north
of Kulpefjellet, taken by a bear.

385
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,919
Finn Haugan from Game Board
investigating-

386
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,759
-If it was the bear
which was found...

387
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,919
Do you know where the troll can be?
You got a track?

388
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,319
No.

389
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,519
What are you looking for?

390
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,199
Rockslides, trees knocked over
and stuff like that.

391
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,479
Do you see anything?

392
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,439
It's that bad?
-Yes.

393
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,039
Maybe we should check it out?

394
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,079
-Are you really ill?
-It goes up and down. Now it hurts.

395
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,239
-This does not feel so safe.
-They are just out a night.

396
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,839
Kalle, we can not...

397
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,239
The trap has not been triggered,
but some Moomins have taken the bait.

398
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,439
Concrete stone and charcoal
is an unbeatable combination.

399
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,119
-Do it now!
-Now?

400
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,799
Now, Hans found tracks of what
he believes is the Ringlefinch...

401
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,599
Now Hans found tracks of what
he believes is the Ringlefinch.

402
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,239
They have found pig carcasses
nearby.

403
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,159
Hans think it's connected.
Now we are going out...

404
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,959
Hurry!

405
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,919
Global warming
have affected our fauna-

406
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,639
-Our flora and our wildlife...

407
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,159
The tracks in this area
comes from a Russian Bear-

408
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,639
-Which probably migrated here
through Finland and Sweden.

409
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,599
Bear store their food under the bridge
here, where it is dark and cold.

410
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,239
It's not strange?
-Not for a Russian bear.

411
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,679
They are accustomed to long, harsh winters.
They gather, just like squirrels.

412
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,319
Aren't the bear tracks a bit strange?

413
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,799
That is the outer toe, so it's
left foot. This is the right foot.

414
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,279
Has the bear been walking like this?
-You've seen bear tracks in the past?

415
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,479
What about the tracks?

416
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,079
He has gnawed the bark of the tree.
A typical Riglefinch.

417
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,079
He'll come back tonight.
I have something to tempt him with.

418
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,439
-Are you going to kill him then?
-Yes.

419
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,079
But first I need to take blood samples.

420
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,959
Is that the syringe?

421
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,719
It is awful!
It is animal cruelty.

422
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,239
It is not animal cruelty.
They are just decoys.

423
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,519
It is too far away.
Should we go further?

424
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,079
No, I'm zooming.
We see it very well.

425
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,759
Strange work hours.

426
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,519
We have been here long. It's not
certain there will be a troll.

427
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:32,079
-We see it well from here.
-But we see a lot better there.

428
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,879
Let's go there.

429
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,839
It's here.

430
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,199
Can't you hear?

431
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,679
Run!

432
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,679
Damn, I hate this!

433
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,199
Keep your distance.
I'll pour some Christian blood.

434
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,639
Move!

435
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,199
Damn! Kalle! Thomas!

436
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,479
Move! Move!

437
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,439
Hans?

438
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,359
Are you okay? You...

439
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,159
Are you okay?

440
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,359
Help him up.

441
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,559
-Come on, Hans.
-Are you okay?

442
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,079
Be careful with the red button.

443
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,919
Give me the syringe.

444
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,359
Stay up there.

445
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,439
Then we know that trolls burst too.

446
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,279
-What about you?
-Well thank you.

447
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,919
No greater danger.

448
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,279
-I was just a little stiff.
-A little stiff?

449
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,039
It's sick!

450
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,999
I got the blood sample.

451
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,519
I'll be there in half an hour.
Goodbye.

452
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,079
You look like a baby!

453
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,679
There are some people who do some
filming. They want to ask some questions.

454
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,199
-Hi. Thomas.
-Hi.

455
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,999
Is that the blood?
-Yes.

456
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,239
-It was a bit hard to take the sample.
-I see it.

457
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,879
Look at you!

458
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,759
-Help yourselves.
-There is a toilet in there.

459
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:49,039
-What do you see?
-Too little red blood cells.

460
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,599
It may take me a couple of days.

461
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,039
Can we get a little interview?

462
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,679
If you just sit there.

463
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,519
-What should I tell?
-All of it.

464
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,279
-We are not allowed to...
-I take responsibility for it.

465
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,439
The problem for the trolls is that they
are not able to convert vitamin D

466
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,319
-From the sunlight, as we can,
to lime or calcium.

467
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,959
When exposed to sunlight
the body overreacts completely.

468
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,599
The stomach swells up.

469
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:34,599
Gas is forced out of the digestive system
and blood vessels with enormous pressure.

470
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,199
And then they burst?
-Yes.

471
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,439
-But some trolls calcify?
-Yes, the older trolls calcify.

472
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,759
The blood vessels are too narrow,
such expansion will occur in the bones.

473
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,639
In seconds, they turn to lime
and is completely petrified.

474
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,279
It would be good if they did not
experience this pain.

475
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:07,439
It is traumatic, even if it
only takes a few seconds.

476
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,039
We would like to give them
a syringe instead.

477
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,799
-I know the answer in a few days.
And then you call me?

478
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,359
-Have a good one.
-Have a good one.

479
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,519
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

480
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,799
-Why so many local papers?
-I collect information.

481
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,679
-About what?
-About trolls.

482
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:24,079
Accidents and stuff that happens
where trolls often is the cause.

483
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,479
-I have folders there.
-May I look?

484
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,039
"The road disappeared."

485
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,199
People always want to
find natural explanations.

486
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:42,399
If you know what you're looking for,
it is easy to see if it was troll.

487
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,759
The bridge is broken in half.

488
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:50,959
He stood in the fjord
and struck his head through the concrete.

489
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,719
Is there trolls this big?

490
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,239
Yes, a Jotun can be that large.
I'm the only one who has seen them.

491
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:07,079
There is a mountain troll territory
up in Finnmarksvidda.

492
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,279
And one of Hardangervidda.

493
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,279
In Jotunheimen are three.
And then you have Dovre.

494
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,079
In which territory is the problem?
Jotunheimen is the closest.

495
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,679
We go there and check first.

496
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,919
We are heading to the first turf
that Hans will check.

497
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:50,279
We are running in a circle
around the territory now.

498
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,679
The territory ends up here.
Since this tire is intact-

499
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:12,519
-Hans says that no troll has
been outside this territory.

500
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,879
If they were
they had chewed on the tire here.

501
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,119
Smile!

502
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,559
That's it. Shoot that...

503
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,279
Trolls love to chew on
old car tires.

504
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:42,999
Here they have tried to kick in,
but they did not pierce the container.

505
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,799
-How many trolls are there?
-Completely impossible to say.

506
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,359
Don't you have a certain overview?

507
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:06,079
The gestation period is 10-15 years.
And they usually only get one little.

508
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,799
-Are they mammals?
-Yes.

509
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,159
Let's see...

510
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,239
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

511
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,439
It looks perfect.
All rocks are where they should.

512
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,919
This is apparently a battle field.

513
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,799
Here, mountain trolls and
woodland trolls fight.

514
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,599
They throw stones at each other.

515
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:51,119
But it's a while ago
there was any activity here.

516
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,599
He who's in back pays.
Isn't that what they say?

517
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,239
Do you remember the drawing of the Jotun?
They are around here in Jotunheimen.

518
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,719
-Where?
-In the mountains.

519
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,439
-What are you going to do?
-Stay there.

520
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,679
I've eaten a whole bread.

521
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,679
Finn refuses to give up.

522
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,239
He claims that all the trolls who escaped
comes from Dovre-

523
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,079
-Just because he did not see any
on the satellite image.

524
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,359
But troll is not visible on satellite
images. It proves nothing!

525
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,919
We will go to the bottom of this.

526
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:08,079
We're going to a farm
that's been featured on local news.

527
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,519
He believes the incident
can be troll related.

528
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,119
Oh, look there!

529
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,359
Did you get it?

530
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,399
-What happened here?
-It was a tornado.

531
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,119
-Were you here when it happened?
-No.

532
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,679
Do you see how the trees are there?

533
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,479
If it was normal wind
all would bee in the same direction.

534
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,279
Who was here and showed you the map?

535
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,319
They did not introduce themselves

536
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:52,399
But they had nice weather maps
and satellite maps of the area.

537
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,199
And we could see something
that looked like tornados.

538
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:02,759
There are traces of at least three troll
which continued north.

539
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,879
That people don't notice
the big beasts-

540
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,239
-Which roared up here!

541
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,439
We'll come back tonight
and take a trip in the woods.

542
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,239
I'm getting a bit tired.

543
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,079
-I do not want to.
-We must stick together.

544
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,879
-Are you serious, Kalle?
-Yes.

545
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,039
Now we have to go.

546
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,119
What do we do now?

547
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,479
Hans?

548
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,039
There are trails in there.

549
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,119
Here is the track. They have been here.

550
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,239
-We can not stand here ourselves.
-This way!

551
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,599
Disused mine.

552
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,879
-They have been here.
-I won't fucking go in there!

553
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,479
There is no troll in there now.

554
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,399
Come on.

555
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,359
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

556
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,639
No, there is no one home.

557
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,519
Hey, I need to have
that troll lump.

558
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,359
-Here.
-I take the camera.

559
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,039
Is it good?

560
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,759
This is not just for one troll

561
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,199
A whole damn pack.

562
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,359
-We can go.
-Come on! Hurry out!

563
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,199
We go. Come on!

564
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,719
Someone is coming!

565
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,319
Come right next to the rock wall!

566
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,799
Can't we go?

567
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,399
We go inside again!

568
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,279
Quick, in here!

569
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,799
Switch off the lights!

570
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,159
I have to get out of here.

571
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,199
-Do you have more troll lump?
-No, not here.

572
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,479
Try to relax. Breathe easy.

573
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,879
Calm down.

574
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,119
-Why are you so stressed?
-I am a Christian!

575
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,439
-We're going to die!
-Damn!

576
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,719
Don't you fucking start sweating!

577
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,919
Good God...

578
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,079
Shut up!

579
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,439
Run!

580
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,919
The sun!

581
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,639
It still works.

582
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,399
There are more left in there.
I have to take them later.

583
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,999
Dovrehubbies.

584
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,919
Why did he not tell us
that he was a Christian?

585
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,079
I have to go up on Dovre and
figure out why the beasts escape.

586
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,239
I can drop you off
down at the campsite.

587
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,119
-What are you doing in my caravan?
-Searching for the recordings.

588
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,039
Have you been snooping
around in my caravan?

589
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,679
-Are you filming now?
-No.

590
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,799
-It's chaos up there.
-Shouldn't you be there?

591
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,719
I do not go into the territory.
I don't do it.

592
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,839
-Turn off the camera.
-It is not on.

593
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,119
Why should people not
know about this?

594
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,399
-What is your job?
-It's classified.

595
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:55,159
Why should people not know
what happens? People are dying!

596
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,879
Why is it kept secret?

597
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,599
-People have the right to know.
-No, they do not.

598
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,999
-Do not touch the camera!
-Don't stick your nose in others business.

599
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,759
Well, this is my problem!

600
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,199
-Go away!
-This is not over.

601
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,559
I'll see what's going on.
Come and shoot if you want.

602
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,119
-We will.
-Are you ready for it?

603
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:28,599
-Yes.
-We continue to film.

604
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,799
We find a new camera.

605
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,559
Here comes the new
camera woman Malica.

606
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,319
-Malica.
-Thomas. You're not a Christian?

607
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,919
-Do you believe in Jesus or God?
-I am a Muslim.

608
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:57,599
That is good.
- Is it okay with Muslims?

609
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,039
I don't know.
We'll see what happens.

610
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:06,999
-It must be okay.
-We will shoot the musk ox?

611
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,599
No, we aren't.

612
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,319
-Let's go.
-Yes, we might as well.

613
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,839
We take it on the road.

614
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,519
-What have you worked with before?
-Mostly for NRK and the BBC.

615
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,559
-I have filmed lions in Tanzania.
-Lion, yeah...

616
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:11,679
The worst I've seen. Damn.

617
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,519
They have broken every damn tree here.

618
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:24,039
A Jotun has probably broken out here.

619
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:28,239
A giant of 170-330 feet who
penetrated into the Dovre-territory-

620
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,239
And frightened down Dovre-trolls here.

621
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,079
A Jotun on a long tour, it's not good.

622
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:40,279
Honestly. Do you all believe in trolls?

623
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,199
Do you think a squirrel plowed down here?

624
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:51,079
If they'd had it good in the territories...
But TSS is putting the lid on everything.

625
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,599
It may look like ordinary
high voltage lines-

626
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,599
-But they are electrified fences
that will keep the trolls in place.

627
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,639
I do not understand how they
came through here.

628
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,519
There are some sourpusses in Dombaes
who manage the power grid.

629
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,959
-Do they know about the trolls?
-No, no.

630
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,199
Have you had any problem with
the power lines at Dovre?

631
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,759
Problem, you can safely say.
Hang up your jackets.

632
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,639
Over here.

633
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:55,919
Several hundred feet of high voltage
cable went into the ground. 300 000 volts.

634
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,159
-When did that happen?
-Three weeks ago.

635
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,239
-Do you know how it happened?
-No, no one knows.

636
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:10,359
The cable went into the ground. It should
withstand hurricane. We have no idea.

637
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,959
-Is this a school assignment?
-Yes. Volda College.

638
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,839
-Are you a teacher?
-No.

639
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,559
Where is the power cables?

640
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:26,479
It is here, then north
and then down here.

641
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,959
-Is it in a circle?
-Yes, it goes in a circle.

642
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:36,519
Isn't that strange?
-Well, maybe a little.

643
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,279
-Yes, it is strange.
-The power goes nowhere.

644
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:47,319
Well, it goes around. And it's
in a nature preserved area.

645
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,479
If the Jotun went through the
high-voltage fence, something's wrong.

646
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,399
I have to get up on Dovre
to try and find the beast.

647
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,239
Up there is the territorial border.

648
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,159
It is difficult
putting up new towers.

649
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:12,999
Protests by farmers
and tourism.

650
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,879
I think the masts are beautiful.

651
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,559
They were put here so the trolls would
have access to food in the territory.

652
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,839
They go around the entire territory.
We have been in this area.

653
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,239
And here.
We have not seen a trace of troll.

654
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,919
I think we'll try to
come up in this area.

655
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:09,559
There is a TSS-house
where we can wait.

656
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:05,439
Some researchers believe that there's
natural explanations, others...

657
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,959
They has registered
more than 1000 quakes...

658
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,479
Now we are in a home range.

659
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,399
I got the impression that you
not want to go into these territories.

660
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,279
Is there any reason for that?

661
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:29,119
It was a mountain troll home range
up in Stryn Fjell.

662
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:33,439
In the 70's they decided
to build the tunnel-

663
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,599
-Right where it was filled
of mountain trolls.

664
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,559
I and TSS tried to protest,
to no avail.

665
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:49,279
My sour job was to go into
this territory and kill all the trolls.

666
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:55,839
Everyone who was there...
Pregnant females and young.

667
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:01,359
Newborns who could not even walk.

668
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,959
It was a bloody massacre.

669
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,319
Almost his whole life has
been about trolls.

670
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:27,039
Every day for him has been
a battle for and with trolls.

671
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,839
He is in many ways a superhero
here in Norway.

672
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,639
What could we have done without him?

673
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:40,799
It is therefore important
that we are making this movie.

674
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,519
-Thomas?
-We must cut.

675
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,199
It's the shoulder.

676
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,519
How is it?

677
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,479
What is that noise?

678
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,559
It's light in an hour.

679
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,519
Shall we follow?

680
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:08,639
He is a heavyweight,
but I have to give it a shot.

681
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,959
He seems to have become completely mad.
This can be a bit unpleasant.

682
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,879
Your phone is ringing, Hans.

683
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,039
-Where is it?
-It's on the seat.

684
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:34,519
It's Thomas. He is
a little busy now. Can I...?

685
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,799
Rabies?

686
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,479
-The Ringlefinch had rabies.
-Can I speak to Hilde.

687
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:50,239
Hey, Hilde. Are you sure?

688
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:58,039
Then I understand some more.
Take care you too. Goodbye.

689
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:03,519
Would not surprise me if all the trolls
we have met have been infected with rabies.

690
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:09,999
He there have spread the shit to both
Riglefinches and Dovrehubbys.

691
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:18,159
And even you, Thomas.
-Me? I do not have rabies.

692
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,439
Hey! Dogs have rabies.

693
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,399
If you have rabies,
you have to be taken to the hospital.

694
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,319
If you think he has rabies
he must be taken to the hospital!

695
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,479
-I do not have rabies.
-Hans!

696
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:42,879
You can't know that I have rabies!
If so have to get to the hospital immediately!

697
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,359
-Here that fucking animal comes.
-I don't give damn!

698
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,999
-We can not be here.
-Look!

699
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,519
Is it heading our way?

700
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:25,599
Are you going out? Are you crazy?

701
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,239
He's fleeing!

702
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,799
Stand still!
I'm trying to get him over here.

703
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,759
"We have a friend in Jesus..."

704
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:04,199
What is he doing?

705
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,279
The battery for the damn flash
died out.

706
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,919
Definitely rabies.

707
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,239
Can't we go to the hospital now?

708
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:46,439
-I have to give a few more doses.
-What are you talking about?

709
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,199
But first I need to tire him out.

710
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,279
He's getting closer!

711
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,439
-We are getting away from him!
That's good.

712
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:21,239
-People! There's people!
-Stop, Hans!

713
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,919
-Get in!
-Hurry up, damn it!

714
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,039
Go! Go!

715
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,479
-What are you doing?
-Stay here!

716
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:42,159
Hans! Get in the car again!

717
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,319
Get in the car!

718
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,759
-What are you doing here?
-I am a seismologist.

719
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,999
I have to pass him.

720
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,559
Watch out!

721
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,879
Is the camera on now?

722
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,879
Hans, what are you doing?

723
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,919
I have to give him the deathblow!

724
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,079
-With that thing?
-Yes.

725
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:58,039
I hope you have recorded what you need.

726
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,279
Follow the road down
and you'll get to the E6.

727
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,239
Now it's quiet!

728
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,439
Malica...

729
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:33,319
Don't fool around.
There is troll on the tape.

730
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,799
Here are the films.

731
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,199
Am I bleeding? What did you say?

732
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,599
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

733
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,759
Look!

734
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,359
Isn't that Finn and the others?

735
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,599
Damn, it's Finn.
Give me the camera!

736
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,479
Thomas, what are you doing?

737
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:47,599
Thomas! Stop!

738
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,079
Here, the recordings end.

739
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,959
No corpse was found in the mine-

740
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,319
And the youths who filmed
are lost without trace.

741
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,719
We urge anyone who knows anything
contact Filmkameratene AS

742
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,999
Or the nearest police station.

743
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:21,719
It has been impossible to confirm the
existence of Troll Security Service Service.

744
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:26,319
Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg
however, gave an indirect confirmation

745
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,399
-On Hukodden in Oslo 25 June 2010.
The press did not do anything.

746
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,639
We want the least possible disruption
in Norwegian nature.

747
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:40,759
Nobody thinks the power lines are beautiful.
I don't think so.

748
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,799
But in Norway we are for electricity-

749
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,879
-But against power lines.
It does not work in the long run.

750
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,799
Norway has troll, so more power lines
in Norway are necessary.

751
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,439
-That's how it is.
-Let's wrap it up there!
