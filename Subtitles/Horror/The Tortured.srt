What's your emergency?'

3
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,024
My son's been kidnapped.

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,443
There was a guy in a...
...in a pickup truck.

5
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,987
A white rusted out pickup truck
with a camper shell on the back.

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,824
- 'What's your son's name, sir?'
- Benjamin. Benjamin Landry.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,535
Fuck! Fuck!

8
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,150
What's going on?
What's going on? Where is he?

9
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,194
Excuse me.
l'm Detective Berger.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,864
l was talking to your husband
about your son's kidnapping.

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,824
Mrs Landry,
can you sit down and talk?

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,494
Where's my son?
l want him back!

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,706
- We're going to find him, OK?
- Oh, God!

14
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,417
l just overheard two cops talking
about how unusual it is

15
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,753
for a child to be abducted
in the parent's plain view.

16
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,298
They said that the fact that the perpetrator
showed so little concern

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:35,135
over whether he could be recognised
points away from kidnapping for ransom.

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,348
- What does that mean?
- Means he's a psychopath.

19
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:47,648
- Jesus.
- My baby.

20
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,441
Mrs Landry, can l help you
with something?

21
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,276
- l'm going to look for my son.
- Where?

22
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,320
Out there. We're not going
to find him in here.

23
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,446
- Please
- No.

24
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,573
Elise. Honey, we've got
to let them do their jobs.

25
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,699

26
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,285
Baby, how can you just stand there?
We're not doing anything!

27
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,789
We've been sitting here all day
while they're trying to do their jobs!

28
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,626

l can't help it.

178
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,711
lt's not your fault.

179
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,091
lt could have happened to me
just as easily, Craig.

181
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,100
...on a rational level...

182
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,981

l can't help it.

183
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,526

184
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,364

Defendant John Kozlowski.

00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,316
Two counts,
murder in the first degree.

219
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,943
Two counts, kidnapping.

220
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,445
Two counts,

00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,530
Two counts,
aggravated assault.

222
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,157
One count,
resisting arrest.

223
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,660
How do you plead?

224
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:50,623
May it please the court,
my client pleads not guilty.

225
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,922
Know that l will not rest
until Kozlowski pays for this,

226
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,466
l promise you.

227
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,010
What is the maximum sentence
Kozlowski can get?

228
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,512
Life without parole.

229
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,598
So there's no chance
he's ever getting out?

230
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,684
Well, practically none.

231
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,311
- What?
- What do you mean, "practically none"?

232
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,481
Well, the jury could recommend
25 years to life

233
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,566
if they felt it was warranted
but that's highly unlikely.

234
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,068
Warranted?

235
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,779
My son was six years old.

236
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,365
How is killing a helpless child
ever warranted?

237
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,410
Look, do your job!

238
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,622
And make sure this piece of shit
gets put away for life.

239
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,171
(Officer) Once l opened the fortified door,
l discovered Benjamin's body.

240
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,632
He must have died
just moments before.

241
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,265
After paramedics responded
to Benjamin,

242
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,101
the investigation quickly
uncovered a mass grave

243
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,937
located in the defendant's
backyard.

244
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,147
Within the site,

245
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,484
numerous body parts in various stages
of decomposition were found.

246
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,361
Rutland County Forensics Team

247
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,323
is still trying to determine
the amount of victims

248
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,408
and their identities
through the skeletal remains

249
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,077
exhumed
from the defendant's property.

250
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:14,040
The task has been challenging
since no victims were intact

251
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,292
and the bodies
were systematically mutilated.

252
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,213
l wish he was dead.
Did you see the look on his face?

253
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,175
l want him dead.

254
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,385
Well, it's not our decision to make.

255
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,015
Elise.

256
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,852
Are you going to be all right?

257
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,105
Do you want to talk to someone?

258
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,441
l'm losing my mind now
because l want justice?

259
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,984
No.

260
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,614
l'm just worried about you.

261
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,454
(Judge) Has the jury reached a verdict?

262
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,832
Yes we have, Your Honour.

263
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,378
Would the defendant please rise
and face the jury?

264
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,301
Would you please tell the court
your verdict?

265
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,096
We the jury
find the defendant...

266
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:19,021
Twenty-five years to life?
He could be out in ten years!

267
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,982
lt was the only way they could get him
to reveal the locations of the other bodies.

268
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,403
- Oh, God.
- Their families needed that for closure.

269
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,738
They put tremendous pressure
on the D.A.

270
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,365
OK, come here.

271
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,539
l want you to help me get a gun.

272
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,000
- What?
- l want you to help me get a gun.

273
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,671
Jesus Christ, Elise, you...
You can't talk like that.

274
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,298
l mean, do you really
want to lower yourself to what he is?

275
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,050
- Aren't we more evolved than that?
- Don't give me that crap.

276
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,010
lt's not crap!

277
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,806
You don't want me
to be like him, Craig?

278
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,392
Fuck off!
How could l ever be like him?

279
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,895
Look, killing him
is not going to change anything.

280
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,647
lt's not going to bring Ben back.

281
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,358
l want him dead.

282
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,277
Craig, l don't want him eating.

283
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,822
l don't want him exercising,
watching TV or fucking jerking off.

284
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,991
- You're just angry.
- Craig, how do you do this?

285
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,870
- Do what?
- Disconnect like this from reality?

286
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,290
We failed our son.

287
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,042
We failed him.

288
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,378
lt was our responsibility
to protect him.

289
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:29,341
And we failed to do that
and he's dead.

290
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,303
Now don't you feel
we need to do something?

291
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,181
For the dignity of our child.

292
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,022
Fuck.

293
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,774
l left the bills on your desk.

294
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,030
The electric bill is overdue.

- Yeah... OK.

346
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,352
OK...

347
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,689
All right, go.

348
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,316
- l'll see you in there.
- OK.

349
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,883
(Assistant) There you go.

350
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,721
- There you go, sir.
- Thanks a lot.

351
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,848
You're welcome.

352
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,560
Can l help you?

353
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,692
Ma'am?

354
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,200
- Do they have any brown sugar?
- Don't see any.

355
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,842
(Customer) Thanks.

356
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,802
- Hey, where's my change?
- (Assistant) What change?

357
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,847
(Craig) l gave you 20 dollars
on pump five, where's my change?

358
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,224
- l'll give you no change.
- Give me my money.

359
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,310
l don't owe you any money.

360
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,146
All right, maybe you're right,
sorry.

361
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,522
Fucking mutt!

362
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,900
- Did you do it?
- Done.

363
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,569
lt should kick in
in about a half an hour.

364
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,464
- lt's been 45 minutes.
- Yeah.

365
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,512
- You sure this is going to work?
- Elise, please.

366
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,890
Maybe they didn't drink
their coffee right away.

367
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,771
They're speeding up.
l think it's working.

368
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,482
They're looking for a place
to pull over.

369
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,152
- Here?
- l guess we have no choice.

370
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,623
All right, now!

371
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,138
Buckle your fucking seatbelt,
asshole.

372
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,848
(lgnition turns over)

373
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,099
Shit!

374
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,685
(Officer) Hey! Stop!

375
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,937
Come on!

376
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,480
(Officer shouting)

377
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,606
Come on!

378
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,108
- (Engine starts)
- Let's go.

379
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,148
For Christ's sake, slow down.

380
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,407
Oh, my...

381
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,761
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

382
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,679
Oh, my God. Craig!

383
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,308
Craig!

384
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,228
God!

385
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,897
Craig!

386
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,819
Are you OK?

387
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,573
Oh, God!

388
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,618
Yeah, l think so.

389
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,871
He's over there!

390
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,177
- Oh, my God. Let me see.
- l'm OK.

391
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,721
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm OK.

392
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,225
He may not have survived this.

393
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,818
- He's alive.
- Thank God.

394
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,588
(Grunting)

395
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,758
Here we go.

396
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,352
By tomorrow,
he'll be out of the woods.

397
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,313
That'll be good.

398
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,357
l'm sure you've figured out by now
why you're here.

399
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,735
And what's going to happen to you.

400
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,029
lf you think
this is going to be over quickly,

401
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,740
you're very much mistaken.

402
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,993
You know, Craig is a doctor.

403
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,912
l can keep you alive for weeks.

404
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,207
And if you think you're just going to
pass out, that's not going to happen.

405
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,752
l have drugs
to keep you conscious.

406
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,422
You're going to feel everything.

407
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:08,428
From now until the moment you die
you will know nothing but agony.

408
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,431
We will just keep hurting you.

409
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,560
And hurting you.

410
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,855
lmagine the worst pain
you've ever experienced.

411
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,274
lt will be much worse than that.

412
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,694
By the time we're finished with you

413
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,572
you're going to look like a cadaver
from an anatomy class.

414
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,868
l know a million things are rushing
through your head right now.

415
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,328
What can l do?

416
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,789
How can l change
what's happening to me?

417
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,541
How can l change their minds?

418
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,544
Well you can't.

419
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,715
There's nothing you can say or do
that will change any of this.

420
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,259
You sealed your fate.

421
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,265
See you in the morning.

422
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,690
- You coming?
- l'll be there in a minute.

423
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,329
(Grunting)

424
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,456
Don't try to talk.

425
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,601
l got this.

426
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,562
(Mobile phone ringing)

427
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,733
Hello.

428
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,028
'Mrs Landry,
this is Detective Berger.

429
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,158
- Mrs Landry?
- 'Yes, hi.'

430
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:40,163
l'm afraid l've got some bad news.
Kozlowski has escaped.

431
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,958
'The prison transport that was carrying
him was commandeered.'

432
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,502
Commandeered?

433
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,962
'We want you to know
we've put the world on this.

434
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,964
'By the off chance
that he tries to reach you,

435
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,258
'l want you to call us directly.

436
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,718
- 'We will find him.'
- Elise?

437
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,887
'l'm on my way to his house now
to look for him.'

438
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,348
OK, thank you.

439
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,935
Elise... l'm sorry.

440
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,498
(Ben) 'Daddy, where's mum?

441
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,920
'Daddy?
Can you tuck me in, please?'

442
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:33,508
(Craig) 'Tuck you in?'
(Ben) 'l can't sleep, l'm too scared.'

443
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,512
(Craig) 'Well, what are you scared of?
l would never let anyone hurt you.'

444
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,808
(Ben) 'Daddy, l'm scared.
Can l sleep with you and Mummy?'

445
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,650
No more painkillers for you,
asshole.

446
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,415
Just in case
you need to use the bathroom.

447
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,543
You sick fuck!

448
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:50,395
l'm going to make sure
you get the death penalty, asshole!

449
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,990
(Creaking)

450
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,522
(Creaking continues)

451
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,601
Shut up!

452
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,026
- Ready?
- l'm ready.

453
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,002
Would you...

454
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,475
Don't you fucking scream,
you cocksucker!

455
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,901
Are you OK?

456
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,530
No, l'm...
l'm really far from OK, Craig.

457
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,532
What are we doing?

458
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,537
What are we doing?
What you wanted us to do.

459
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,915
l don't think l can do this.

460
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,793
Elise, we are doing this.

461
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:06,007
lt's done, he's here.
There's no turning back, not now.

462
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,010
He showed no mercy
for our son.

463
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,179
He tortured Benjamin to death.

464
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,807
That's not a person
lying on that table.

465
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,518
lt's a fucking monster.

466
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,286
You think you got a reprieve,
you couldn't be more wrong.

467
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,663
You sick son of a bitch.

468
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,761
You ever had
a swimmer's cramp?

469
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,430
lt's a real bitch, isn't it?

470
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,141
And that's just one muscle
cramping up.

471
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,936
Now imagine all your muscles
cramping up at the same time.

472
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,652
lt's terrifying, isn't it?

473
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,571
Here it comes.

474
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,924
Wake up! Wake up!

475
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,930
lt's amazing
what one needle can do.

476
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,433
You see, this needle's going
to keep you conscious and aware...

477
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,076
...while this needle
will inflict more pain

478
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,620
than you've ever felt
in your life.

479
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,581
My son begged for his life.

480
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,835
He screamed for you to show him mercy,
but you didn't listen.

481
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,128
You didn't hear him.

482
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,797
Maybe you were fucking deaf!

483
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,216
This needle's going
to shatter your eardrum

484
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,926
and destroy your ear canal.

485
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,553
Stay fucking still!

486
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,432
Because if you move, it could
cause you to bleed inside your skull

487
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,768
and that blood will become trapped
and it'll drain into your throat.

488
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:26,313
And since you're gagged,
you'll start to fucking choke!

489
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,568
ln about an hour or so, you'll drown
in your own fucking blood.

490
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,613
So if l were you, l'd stay still.

491
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,289
(Car alarm)

492
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,833
Craig. Craig, Craig wake up.

493
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,419
lt's the car alarm.

494
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,747
- (Groaning)
- Oh, yeah?

495
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,875
That's interesting.

496
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,551
(Kettle boiling)

497
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,636
(Craig) l've done quite a bit of research
on torture specifically for this occasion.

498
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,642
l wonder if you're familiar
with the game of Slonik?

499
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,608
lt means 'little elephant'
in Russian.

500
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,775
See?

501
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,322
Very popular
with the Soviet Secret Police.

502
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,450
And also very effective.

503
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,410
Gel.

504
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:54,355
Stop moving
or l will pour this on your face.

505
00:53:54,481 --> 00:54:00,110
Good boy.

506
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,030
Do you know that drowning people
actually scratch their faces

507
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,449
before they take
their first fatal breath of water?

508
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:10,287
Yes, their hunger for air
is that great.

509
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,499
You see, the difference between
suffocation and drowning

510
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,794
is that when you're drowning, you have
a choice to take that last breath of water

511
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,337
and end your suffering.

512
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,714
But not in this case.

513
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,260
Soon the cells of your body
will start demanding oxygen

514
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,804
and then they'll
start screaming for it.

515
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,723
Your need for oxygen
will create an urge to breathe.

516
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,767
The greatest urge imaginable.

517
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,395
An urge you won't be able
to fulfil.

518
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,438
You suffocated my son.

519
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,149
Now you're going to feel
what it's like.

520
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:43,195
How does that feel?

521
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,617
(Craig) l want to know how someone
like you can justify

522
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,577
the sick shit that you do?

523
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,164
How you can derive pleasure
from other people's pain?

524
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,543
(Elise) That's enough breathing.
(Craig) Shall we do it again?

525
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,004
(Grunting)

526
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,135
(Elise) No mother
should have to bury their child.

527
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,182
No mother
should outlive her son.

528
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,518
This is what it feels like
to not have control.

529
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:18,188
This is how our son felt,
you fucking piece of shit!

530
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,732
You like it?

531
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,567
How does it feel?

532
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,194
- How does it fucking feel?
- Craig, stop it!

533
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,739
- You like it?
- Craig, stop it!

534
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,204
He's dead.

535
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:36,957
No.

536
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,587
No! No! No!

537
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,797
- No, Craig!
- lt's not enough! We're not done!

538
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,424
- Craig, it's over.
- No, it's not nearly over!

539
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,051
- Stop it!
- He took our son!

540
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,178
And we just took his life!

541
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,263
(Footsteps)

542
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,267
(Door opening)

543
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,145
- Did you lock the front door?
- l don't know.

544
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,938
- Elise, go.
- What do you want me to do?

545
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,565
Just go! Deal with it!

546
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:05,110
But whatever's up there
cannot come down here!

547
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,051
Come on.

548
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,735
Craig!

549
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,947
Keep your hands
where l can see them.

550
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,121
Motherfucker, come on.

551
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,791
- Squatters, huh?
- What?

552
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,127
This cottage belongs
to old Frank Jessop

553
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,129
and you're squatting
on his property.

554
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,259
Come on.

555
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,636
(Dog barking)

556
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,222
Please call your dog off.

557
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,933
l'll call my dog,
when l damn well please.

558
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,352
l...
l'm a real estate agent.

559
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,146
l'm showing this property
to a client of mine.

560
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,522
That's bullshit, lady.

561
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,650
Mr Jessop died
over a year ago.

562
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,027
This property's been
on the market ever since.

563
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,744
So what are all those noises
downstairs?

564
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,998
We're checking the foundation
of the building.

565
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,916
Got any lD on you?

566
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,043
Yes, l do.

567
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,266
What's your name?
You're trespassing on state property,

568
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,977
waving a gun around,
making threats.

569
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,939
- Where's this client of yours?
- (Craig) Right here.

570
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,819
Well, Elise.

571
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,281
This place sure is charming

572
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,408
but l am concerned
about the basement.

573
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,369
ls everything OK up here?

574
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,707
l don't know,
is everything OK up here?

575
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,170
l'm checking
that story of yours.

576
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,172
Come on, boy.

577
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,094
Jesus Christ.

578
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,304
He's alive.

579
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,889
Come on.

580
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,527
(Mobile phone ringing)

581
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,037
- Detective Berger.
- U.S. Marshall Lynn Conover here.

582
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,915
l've got some good news for you.
We've got a break in your case.

583
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,085
'A woman here says
she saw a prison van three days ago'

584
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,254
just off of old Howell Ranch Road.

585
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,673
Stay there, l'm on my way.

586
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,467
(Elise) Wake up! Wake up!

587
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,013
No. Wait, wait.

588
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,723
l don't know
what you're talking about.

589
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:22,975
Put the tape on.

590
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,935
No. Wait, wait.

591
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,104
l don't remember anything.

592
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,064
l don't know who you are.

593
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,024
l don't even know who l am.

594
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,069
You don't remember
who you are?

595
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:38,031
l remember some kind
of a car accident.

596
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,954
l don't believe him.

597
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,623
l don't believe you.
This is too convenient!

598
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,547
Craig!
Where are you going?

599
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,886
- l can't remember a thing.
- l don't believe you.

600
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:19,364
Could it be true?

601
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,285
- Yes.
- Yes?

602
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:27,039
Yes. l mean, he did suffer
a serious head injury,

603
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,374
memory loss could be possible.

604
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,544
Fuck. Fuck!

605
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,346
- God, what do we do?
- l don't know.

606
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,598
What if he's lying?

607
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,977
That's also a possibility
considering his circumstances.

608
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,648
But there's no way
to know for sure.

609
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,443
So, that's it then?

610
01:00:56,569 --> 01:01:00,405
We just leave him here?
All this for nothing?

611
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,700
Craig, he cannot
get off that easy.

612
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,079
That animal needs to pay
for what he's done.

613
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,456
God, listen to yourself.

614
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:12,292
You want to torture a man who has
no idea why we're doing it to him?

615
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:16,171
lt's the same guy.
lt's the same guy!

616
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,647
Shit.

617
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,401
- Detective Berger?
- Yeah.

618
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,986
- U.S. Marshal Conover.
- Nice to meet you. What do we know?

619
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,905
We've got a lot.
We've got a second lead.

620
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,783
We've got a local here who says
our convicts are held up in some cabin.

621
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,618
Do we know where?

622
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,579
He's on his way now to give us
a pinpoint but it's in this area.

623
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,291
The problem is this area
is 10,000 square miles of forest.

624
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,837
Wake up. Wake up!

625
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,631
Wake up!
Come on, get up.

626
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,342
What's she doing?

627
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,219
You say
you don't remember anything.

628
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,846
l know you're lying.

629
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,265
What was my son's name?

630
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,560
l didn't...

631
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,354
l don't know, lady.

632
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,572
Come on.
Come on, that's nothing.

633
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,615
That didn't hurt.
This is nothing.

634
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,118
What was my son's name?

635
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,579
No, stop, please!

636
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,881
Just say his name.

637
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,259
Just say his name.
l'm not going to stop.

638
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,929
Somebody help me, please!

639
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,730
You broke 18 bones
in his body.

640
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,148
This is nothing.

641
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:08,492
Say his name!

642
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,787
Say his fucking name!

643
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,207
Benjamin!
His name is Benjamin!

644
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,627
l'm sorry.
Please stop! Please!

645
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,548
Still believe
he doesn't remember?

646
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,471
You think that hurt?

647
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,016
lt's going to get
a lot worse tomorrow.

648
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,074
No... No!

649
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,928
So what do you
have to tell us?

650
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,223
- l told you... l'm sorry.
- Sorry?

651
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,811
"l'm sorry"
is not going cut it.

652
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,108
But these will.

653
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,954
No, no, no...

654
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,342
No!

655
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,324
You crushed my boy's liver.

656
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:29,841
No!

657
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,305
Oh, fuck!

658
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,892
Fuck this fucking shit!

659
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,271
l can't take this any more.

660
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,732
Get me out of there!

661
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,945
(Screaming)

662
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,932
Now what?

663
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:28,441
So we just pick up tomorrow
where we left off?

664
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:33,321
Have breakfast,
get our tools ready.

665
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,265
We could just walk away,

666
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:04,477
call the cops, he'd go to jail
and we could just disappear.

667
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,106
l just want Ben back.

668
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,071
- l want him back so bad.
- Yeah, l know.

669
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,741
So do l.

670
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,054
He's held up in a cabin,
up the road.

671
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,556
- Can't miss it.
- Appreciate it.

672
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,391
All right everybody,
listen up!

673
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:47,395
This is it.
Spread out, stay alert.

674
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,816
(Officer) Come on, boy.

675
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,363
(Officer #2) Spread out!

676
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,448
(Officer) Come on, boy!
Find him, boy!

677
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,922
(Door rattles)

678
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,680
(Rattling continues)

679
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,083
Craig! Craig!

680
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,505
Come on. Let's get him back
on the table before he wakes up.

681
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,389
Craig!

682
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,582
- Where is he?
- Oh, God.

683
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,335
He just...
He walked out the front door.

684
01:10:57,461 --> 01:11:00,880
- You OK?
- He just stared at me.

685
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:04,550
- We can't let him get away.
- Be careful.

686
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,928
(Dogs barking)

687
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,868
This way.

688
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,084
(Dogs barking)

689
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,004
(Officer) Come on, boy.

690
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,262
(Metallic clanging)

691
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,935
There he is!

692
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,815
Freeze!

693
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,155
