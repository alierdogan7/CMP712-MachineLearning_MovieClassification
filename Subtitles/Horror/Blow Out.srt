You see, I've worked on this face.

486
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,474
I've hidden everything
so you don't see the makeup.

487
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,310
You got makeup on right now?

488
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,187
- I do.
- I don't believe it.

489
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,522
- Yeah.
- I don't believe it!

490
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,065
Absolutely.

491
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,651
And you see, this took me two hours.

492
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,653
And this is the no-makeup look.

493
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,656
Really? Well, I would like to see
what the makeup look looks like.

494
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,908
- I bet that's good, huh?
- Well, I --

495
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,869
I only do that for special occasions.

496
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,998
How about a broken nose? How --
How would you deal with a broken nose?

497
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,001
Well, that's easy.
You just take, like, a little --

498
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,004
Wait a minute. Let me see.
I can even show you in here.

499

- Yeah, like, you get a brush like this, right?
- Yeah?

500
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,135
You take a little brown powder.

501

- You just kinda make a little brown --
- [ Laughs ] What are you doin'?

Hey, now wait a minute.
This is serious business here.

- You interested or not?
- Oh, yes. Okay. Sorry.

504
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,604
Okay. Make a brown line
and kinda smudge it in right here.

505
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,483
It has to be real subtle
so no one notices or anything like that.

- Yes, I am.

- Why?

and you're goin' off on me.

All right, it all started in school, okay?

519
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,734
I mean, I was, uh, the kind of kid
who fixed radios...

520

won all the science fairs.

You know the type.

522
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,242
Well, after that I went into the service --
went into the army -- and I refined my skills there.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

- Were you in any wars or anything?
- No, no.

525
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,208
I was such a communication whiz

527
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,463
Then I went into the police for a while,
and after that I, uh, went into movies.

528
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,257
Wait a minute.
You were a cop?

529
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,219
- No, no. I worked for the Keen Commission.
- What's that?

530
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:53,556
It's just a group of politicians that got together
to try to stop police corruption.

531
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,518
- Oh.
- Then I quit that and, uh --

532
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,562
- Well, what'd you do?
- Well, it's a long story.

533
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,940
- You really don't want to know about it.
- Oh, I do.

534
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,651
I really do.
This is very interesting.

535
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,779
How about movies?
I thought you wanted to know about movies.

536
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,698
Yeah, movies are great,
but I mean, this is --

537
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,410
this is, like, real life
on the streets, you know.

It's exciting.

00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,540
All right.

540
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,752
I, um -- I wired
their best undercover cop.

541
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,255
Guy by the name of Freddie Corso.

542
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,925
And one of Freddie's cases
was to set up a corrupt police captain...

543
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,010
who was trying
to shake down a mob guy.

544
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,265
My job was to rig a wire on him
so I could record the conversation.

Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "wire"?

546
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,937
[ Jack ] Well, it's just a tiny little mike
that's attached to a transmitter...

547
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,022
that I strapped around Freddie's waist.

548

549
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,490
Okay, Freddie, give me a sound check.
Count to 10.

these deals where you could be blocks away...

552
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,090
and you could hear everything
within 10 feet of him -- Fantastic!

- [ Freddie ] Hey, Milt, how you doin'?
- [ Milt ] Hello, Freddie. How you doin'?

- [ Milt ] Nice seein' you. You look good.

You look like a million in that getup.

[ Milt ]
Thank you.

557
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:22,187
[ Freddie ] So, uh, I brought
someone here I want you to meet.

558
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,314
Captain Kennedy, this is Milt.

559
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,774
[ Milt ] Who the fuck
wants to meet Captain Kennedy?

560
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,776
[ Freddie ]
Milt, take it easy.

561
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,029
[ Milt Speaking Italian ]
I don't wanna meet him.

562
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,531
[ Freddie ] Hey, take it easy.
This man could put the cap on everything.

563
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,492
You won't be able to go
to the bathroom alone.

564
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,870
- [ Milt ] All right, come on in the car. We'll take a ride, we'll talk a little.
- [ Freddie ] All right.

565
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,373
[ Jack ] And the first thing that the captain
says to the mob guy, he says, uh --

566
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,835
[ Captain ] Look, I understand
that the man has a brother-in-law. Okay?

567
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,546
Now, I happen to see him
talkin' to his brother-in-law.

568
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,841
Now, the brother-in-law
is a known felon, Freddie...

569
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,386
and MiIt's out on parole,
and that's a parole violation.

570
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,389
Now, I'm gonna have to tell
the parole officer. Okay?

571
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,351
If I tell the parole officer,
he's goin' back in the can.

572
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:06,773
But, uh, I think I could work something out
that I don't have to tell him for, uh, 5,000 bucks.

00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,942

clear as a bell on tape...

00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,118

- You're sweatin', Freddie. What's the matter?

[ Jack ] The one thing the fuckin' whiz kid
didn't think of...

584
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,479
was maybe that Freddie
would get nervous and sweat.

585
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,482
He was sweating so bad
that the battery in the transmitter...

586

and burning a hole in him.
