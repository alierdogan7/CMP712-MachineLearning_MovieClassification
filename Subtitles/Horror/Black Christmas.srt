1
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:31,265
# Old Mr. Kringle
is soon gonna jingle #

2
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:34,132
# The bells that'll tingle
all your troubles away #

3
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:37,002
# Everybody's waiting
for the man with the bag #

4
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:39,973
# 'Cause Christmas
is coming again #

5
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,710
# He's got a sleigh full #

6
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:46,873
# It's not gonna stay full
of stuff that he's dropping... #

7
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,942
# Everybody's waiting
for the man with the bag #

8
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:53,978
# 'Cause Christmas
is coming again #

9
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,649
# He'll be here #

10
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:10,369
# He's got a sleigh full #

11
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,270
# It's not gonna stay full #

12
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:15,606
# Of stuff that he's dropping
every stop of the way #

13
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:18,807
# Everybody's waiting
for the man with the bag #

14
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:21,509
# 'Cause Christmas
is coming again #

15
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,110
# He'll be here... #

16
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:53,977
Merry Christmas.

17
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,180
Merry Christmas
from your friends and family

18
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,314
at the Clark Sanitarium.

19
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:06,322
Merry Christmas.

20
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:07,921
Happy holidays.

21
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:11,093
Leave me alone!

22
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:16,302
Merry Christmas.

23
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,002
Happy holidays.

24
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,675
Happy birthday.

25
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:23,442
Behold. Wise men from the east
came to Jerusalem,

26
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,005
saying, "Where..."

27
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,690
How'd you get in here?

28
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,423
The door was open.

29
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:40,328
I was looking for the children's
ward, and I got lost.

30
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,492
This ain't no place
for Santa Claus.

31
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,868
Not at Christmas.

32
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,405
Lenz?

33
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:56,736
Billy Lenz?

34
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:58,908
That's the guy that killed

35
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,180
his family at Christmas,
back when I was a kid.

36
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,154
You know, a lot of
people say he's dead.

37
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:08,351
Poke your head inside.

38
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:13,125
Check if he's been naughty
or nice.

39
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:16,690
No, that's... it's okay.

40
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,031
I thought so.

41
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:23,232
You guys keep him locked
up with just a padlock?

42
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,208
That lock's just to make him
feel at home.

43
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:27,336
Right, 'cause his mom kept him

44
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:29,073
locked in the basement
his whole life.

45
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:30,273
The attic.

46
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:32,782
See, that's the key
to Billy Lenz.

47
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:35,081
<i>He just wants to feel at home,</i>

48
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:37,485
especially on Christmas.

49
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:39,682
He's tried to escape
every year...

50
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,559
...just to be home on Christmas.

51
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,562
It tastes like chicken.

52
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,833
Because it's chicken.

53
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:56,634
It's the closest
we could get to how

54
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:58,369
Mom used to taste.

55
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:08,542
Kyle...

56
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:11,249
- Mm.
- It's late.

57
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,756
I have to go inside.

58
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,156
Mm-mm.

59
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,489
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-mm.

60
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,960
They might be waiting for me.

61
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:21,961
See? That's them calling.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,366
You can be with them any time.

63
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:26,029
Yeah, but it's not
any time, though.

64
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,197
It's Christmas.

65
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,469
I know, but it's our first.

66
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:30,565
We should be together.

67
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:31,667
We will.

68
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,439
On Christmas Day.

69
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,878
I can't wait until you
see what I got you.

70
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,282
And then, we'll be
together all week.

71
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:42,878
Well, besides when
I have to work.

72
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,718
Look, I'm excited,
baby, but I got to be

73
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:47,247
with my sorority sisters, too.

74
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,659
I mean, I've never
really had a big family.

75
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:53,926
I'm your family now.

76
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:01,171
I love you.

77
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,696
I'll see you later.

78
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:14,617
Hello.

79
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:19,856
# I love
those J-I-N-G-L-E bells #

80
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,255
# Bong! #

81
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:24,057
# Jingle bells #

82
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:27,496
# Jingle bells,
jingle all the way #

83
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:32,765
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh #

84
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:35,398
# Jingle bells,
jingle bells... #

85
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,533
Billy.

86
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:40,544
Billy.

87
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:40,941
Billy...

88
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,305
Girls, I can't find
Billy's present

89
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,907
under the tree here.

90
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,976
Come on, girls, we can't
start the Secret Santa

91
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,748
without Billy's present.

92
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,314
Hello? Who drew

93
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,349
Billy's name?

94
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,327
Um, Ms. Mac,
it's a Secret Santa.

95
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,227
Can't we just get on with
this thing, so I can party

96
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,891
for a few days
before having to deal

97
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,456
with the family on Christmas.

98
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,865
Have you looked outside?

99
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:04,597
It's raining hail the size
of Yao's ball sack.

100
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:06,161
It'll stop.

101
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:08,605
The party gods won't allow me
to be here by myself

102
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,472
- over Christmas break.
- Oh, I'll be here, Dana.

103
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,534
Yeah, they're making me work
next week.

104
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:15,206
That sucks-- everyone
should be home for Christmas.

105
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,113
All right, all right,
who's not here?

106
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:18,377
Um, like everybody.

107
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,941
Chelsea?

108
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,248
She went home this morning.

109
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,618
- Greer?
- No, that was her on the phone.

110
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,247
She and Erin and Taylor

111
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,019
are off on that cozy
little ski trip

112
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:27,616
with the boys
from G.A.D. next door.

113
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,527
Didn't I see Clair earlier?

114
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,331
Isn't she upstairs
writing a card to her sister?

115
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,060
No, I think her sister
picked her up earlier.

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,727
Remember, this is the occasion

117
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,361
for Clair and her sister
and her mom

118
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:39,929
to... bury the hatchet
and rediscover

119
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,065
each other.

120
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,665
Oh.

121
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:44,802
I'd like to bury the hatchet
with my sister...

122
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:48,779
...right in her head.

123
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,063
In your dreams, Billy.

124
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,900
In your dreams.

125
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:38,556
Lauren, we're opening up
presents.

126
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:44,133
Clair, we're opening up
presents.

127
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,399
Okay, I realize that
you're an only child,

128
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:48,372
so let me explain.

129
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:49,669
Christmas is just Darwin.

130
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,073
The weak get eaten.

131
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:54,443
We're opening up
gifts right now!

132
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:56,447
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes, your presents

133
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,573
are mine!

134
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,884
Now show me.

135
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,319
Okay.

136
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,889
We're opening up
presents in five minutes!

137
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,988
If you're not downstairs,

138
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:15,329
then I'm going
to take your presents.

139
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,198
Just fuck Christmas.

140
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:18,703
Fuck it.

141
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:20,705
Whatever.

142
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:25,268
Hey, Megan, are you okay?

143
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,972
Yes!

144
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,947
No.

145
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:31,813
Megan...

146
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:41,152
Honestly, Santa loves...

147
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,082
All right.

148
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,146
Who's fucking with me?

149
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,534
Clair?

150
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:11,810
What are you doing?

151
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:31,259
# Fa la la la la
la la la la #

152
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,392
# 'Tis the season to be jolly #

153
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:36,527
Hey, Santa, if I sit
on your lap,

154
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,595
will you give me
what I want for Christmas?

155
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,934
I don't know,
you've been good all year.

156
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:47,947
You sure you want to blow it
on the last day, huh?

157
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:49,675
I'll be good.

158
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:53,584
I bet you will.

159
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,882
Happy holidays.

160
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,445
Yeah.

161
00:13:58,558 --> 00:14:01,083
Ever seen the backseat
of a sleigh?

162
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:05,694
# Fa la la la la la
la la la #

163
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:09,932
You know, Santa
checks his list twice.

164
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,838
I know you're
very, very naughty.

165
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:14,298
Hello?

166
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,009
Santa, my shift's over.

167
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:25,748
You know, Santa's not one
to keep a girl waiting.

168
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,640
##

169
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:57,381
Mrs. Mac, why don't you
open the present we got you.

170
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,146
Because we have to open
Billy's present first.

171
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:03,090
It's a 15-year Delta
Alpha Kappa tradition.

172
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,217
Okay, I...

173
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,057
I drew that name.

174
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,458
But can I say,
I'm sorry, I'm just,

175
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,794
I'm really not okay
with any of this.

176
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,793
I mean, buying a
Christmas present

177
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,665
for a serial killer?

178
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,260
No, you see,

179
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:19,671
serial killers murder
repeatedly for sexual thrill.

180
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,402
Billy Lenz
was a spree killer.

181
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,704
Dude just fucking lost it.

182
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:23,768
Thank you.

183
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,438
Oh, whatever, Melissa, okay?

184
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,107
I'm just offended
by a pagan sacrifice

185
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,309
to ward off evil spirits
on Christmas.

186
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,545
Heather, we're just having
a little bit of fun.

187
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:33,918
Christmas is more about warding
off evil spirits than Halloween.

188
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:36,048
What Christmas shit

189
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,615
in this room resembles
anything Christian, huh?

190
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,288
It's all neo-pagan magic.

191
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,455
Christmas tree--

192
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:45,159
a magical rite ensuring
the return of the crops.

193
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,861
The mistletoe is nothing
but a conception charm.

194
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,062
Fifth century Christians

195
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,537
jacked a Roman winter festival--

196
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,301
12 days in December
where the nights were long

197
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:56,902
and the Earth was roamed
by the demons of chaos.

198
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:59,345
And fucking Santa Claus?

199
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,248
This fat voyeur
that watches you all year long

200
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:05,013
to make sure you live up to

201
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:08,079
his standards of decency before
breaking into your house?

202
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:11,057
And that is different
from what Billy did... how?

203
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:16,385
Billy didn't break in.

204
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,590
Billy lived here.

205
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:41,721
<i>Billy Edward Lenz was born</i>

206
00:16:41,757 --> 00:16:45,693
<i>with a rare liver disease
that gave him yellow skin.</i>

207
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,695
Merry Christmas, Billy.

208
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,323
<i>His parents hated each other.</i>

209
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,925
<i>The mother hated Billy.</i>

210
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,664
<i>He was not the child
she always wanted.</i>

211
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:58,935
<i>When she looked at her son,
all she saw</i>

212
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:01,067
<i>was her husband.</i>

213
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:48,180
Why you bothering
putting with those cookies?

214
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:49,919
Santa ain't coming to see you.

215
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:55,960
Russians shot his sleigh down.

216
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,625
Santa Claus... is dead.

217
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,248
Don't listen to her.

218
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:14,874
Listen, if you go
upstairs to your room,

219
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:16,441
you'll find something
for yourself.

220
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,010
Now, go.

221
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:56,887
Look, I don't give
a shit if you're mean to me,

222
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,188
but to your own kid
on Christmas?

223
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,455
This is my present to myself.

224
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,656
I don't have to listen
to you no more.

225
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,130
You didn't listen to me before.

226
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:12,605
Who are you?

227
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:13,904
What the fuck do you want?

228
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:14,932
He's my family now.

229
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,671
Get out of here!

230
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,703
She's mine now.

231
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:19,942
This guy?

232
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,108
This guy, this piece of shit,
is your boyfriend?

233
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,551
Gonna be my husband.

234
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:25,952
Hey, what the fuck is that?

235
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:27,512
I was in Vietnam.

236
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,287
Do you think I'm afraid of
a dude holding a fucking hammer?

237
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,384
No!

238
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,664
Alpha Kappa.

239
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,005
Hello?

240
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,534
Hello-hello.

241
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,871
Very funny, Kyle.

242
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,751
I think someone's in trouble.

243
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,063
You want a Christmas cookie?

244
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:31,438
You're my cookie,
and I could gobble you up!

245
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,875
Billy, what have you done?!

246
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,879
What have you done?

247
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:37,039
Where's Agnes?!

248
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:40,642
She's my family now.

249
00:22:40,717 --> 00:22:41,979
Hey, shouldn't
you get going?

250
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,486
Don't you have lots
of toys to deliver

251
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,748
- to good little boys and girls?
- Shh.

252
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:48,952
Get out of my house.

253
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,516
I'm gonna kill you.

254
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:53,761
- Call the police.
- Please.

255
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:55,628
Police ain't gonna do shit
about one wack-job phone call.

256
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,190
Just dial "star 69."

257
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:58,428
That just calls him back--

258
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:00,266
unless there's something
you need him to clarify.

259
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:10,406
Caller I.D.
says Clair's cell.

260
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:16,216
You really shouldn't
provoke somebody like that.

261
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:17,845
What would you know
about dealing with anyone

262
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:19,412
other than your NASCAR daddy?

263
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,151
I'm going home.

264
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,922
Yeah, yeah, run to Daddy!

265
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,598
At least my family
wants me to come home.

266
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,692
You guys,

267
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:31,702
come on.

268
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,203
It's, like, Christmastime.

269
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,204
Yeah.

270
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:35,205
Come on, Heather.

271
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,206
What about your present?

272
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,572
Give it to Billy.

273
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,441
Merry Christmas, Heather.

274
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,320
Merry Christmas, everyone.

275
00:23:57,595 --> 00:24:01,053
You're all like my family now.

276
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:19,809
Oh.

277
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,512
Thanks, Eve.

278
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:24,214
That's... that's so sweet.

279
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,884
I know you like
the Bible and stuff.

280
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,722
Well, that's the spirit!

281
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,193
Well, come on, everybody.

282
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:32,423
Let's get
this thing rolling.

283
00:24:32,463 --> 00:24:33,657
What have we got here now?

284
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:36,428
Oh! Melissa.

285
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:37,491
There you are.

286
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:38,502
And, uh...

287
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:41,528
Let's see-- Dana, very nice.

288
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:43,437
I wonder what this could be.

289
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:45,305
And let's see...

290
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,310
Aw, "Mrs. Mac."

291
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,606
You shouldn't have.

292
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:48,737
I'll open it later.

293
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:02,517
Not again.

294
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,855
Every goddamn time.

295
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,319
My little Agnes.

296
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:26,535
She's my family now.

297
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,453
All right,
let's get this party going.

298
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:39,013
Um, let's see.

299
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,355
This one's for Megan.

300
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,384
Kelli, is Megan coming down?

301
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:45,362
All right, we'll save
that one for later.

302
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,364
Uh... Oh.

303
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,093
Here's one for Mrs. Mac.

304
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,395
Ooh, it's a big one.

305
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,132
All right, I'll wait.

306
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:55,469
And here is another
one for Melissa.

307
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:56,940
It's a little one.

308
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,602
Well, you know what they say.

309
00:26:58,643 --> 00:27:00,702
Big things come in small pa...

310
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,235
Well, something like that;
I don't know.

311
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,805
It's all right,
let's see what else.

312
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,614
Then we'll open the stockings.

313
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:08,744
Oh, Eve, wait, wait.

314
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:09,913
Let me find your gift.

315
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:11,946
Eve...

316
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:18,422
"To Eve from Santa."

317
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,798
Eve?

318
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:28,201
Does Eve have someplace to be?

319
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,105
The Island of Misfit Toys.

320
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,769
Her mother was a legacy.

321
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,038
And?

322
00:27:33,078 --> 00:27:34,170
Her mother's dead.

323
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:35,874
She has no boyfriend,

324
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:36,973
no family.

325
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:38,608
I mean, really,
where does she have to go?

326
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,913
Who hasn't gotten
a gift yet? Uh...

327
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,390
Lauren?

328
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,416
Just give her a shot of tequila,

329
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,226
wish her happy holidays,
and she's good to go.

330
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,629
Happy holidays.

331
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,597
All right, look, I know

332
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,036
this is the whole
Secret Santa thing,

333
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:01,664
but I know, um,
Clair drew your name.

334
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,772
Oh, yeah?
She get me anything good?

335
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,573
Oh, yeah.
It's a music box.

336
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,108
It plays "Dance of
the Sugar Plum Fairies."

337
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:13,779
Oh, fuck, no.

338
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,446
I'm starting to see
the sugar plum fairies.

339
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:17,385
I don't need to hear
the little fuckers, too.

340
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:19,550
Language. Language.

341
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,066
Wireless services report

342
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,193
several microwave
relay stations are off-line.

343
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:33,831
Now, a relay station sends calls
out of the area, so that is why

344
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:36,898
your cell may work on local
calls, but not on long distance.

345
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:37,931
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

346
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:42,611
Does it come with a man
to wear it for?

347
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:44,815
Whoo!

348
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:47,583
Here is our real present.

349
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,225
I got it.

350
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,198
Why is Megan calling here?

351
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,697
Hey, where are you?

352
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:08,263
She's my family now.

353
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:10,241
Everyone
should be home for Christmas.

354
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:13,734
I'll be home for Christmas.

355
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,739
I'm going to bury the hatchet,
in your head.

356
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,519
That was not Megan.

357
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:33,022
You have reached the main menu

358
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,534
of Clement University
campus security.

359
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:36,762
During the Christmas break...

360
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:39,135
Is Megan in her room?

361
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,799
I don't know.
I was just packing. What...

362
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,139
What's going on?

363
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:56,085
Oh, my God.

364
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,056
Kyle.

365
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,786
What are you doing in there?

366
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:02,556
I wanted to spend
the night with you.

367
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,257
It's okay.

368
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:06,663
And I knew that mama-san

369
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,225
and your sisters here would kick
me out, so I-I tried to sneak

370
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:12,102
into your room, but the window
wasn't open, so I, uh,

371
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:14,232
I saw that,
I saw that Megan's was,

372
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:16,538
so I climbed up here
to see you.

373
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,305
Is Megan in her room?

374
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:20,141
I don't know.

375
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,011
You climbed up into her room,

376
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:23,845
and you don't know
if she's in it?

377
00:30:23,884 --> 00:30:25,681
It's dark.

378
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,914
Does he think
we're fucking stupid?

379
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:29,019
You were in Megan's room.

380
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:30,384
The call came from Megan's cell.

381
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,051
What call?

382
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:33,286
Can I just say,

383
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:34,658
I'm sorry,

384
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:36,663
but that-that fucking voice,

385
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:38,187
that was not Megan or Kyle.

386
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,460
That was the fucking
devil, okay?

387
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:41,967
And they were not talking to us.

388
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,469
They were talking to Billy.

389
00:30:43,503 --> 00:30:45,971
Billy Lenz, the guy
that used to live in this house?

390
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:47,906
Well, you're definitely
getting punked.

391
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,342
Yeah, Billy Lenz
is our fucking life.

392
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:53,073
You know, you spoiled bitches,

393
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:55,946
you come here for a couple
of years and you leave.

394
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:58,213
I live here.

395
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:00,652
I stay here.

396
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,086
I used to play on this street

397
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:03,919
before they turned them
into frat houses.

398
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:07,358
This was the house that scared
the shit out of us,

399
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:08,486
my whole life.

400
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:10,826
What happened?

401
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:14,994
You mean after
he washed down his...

402
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:18,231
Christmas cookies
with a glass of milk?

403
00:31:50,537 --> 00:31:52,528
##

404
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,708
Merry Christmas, Agnes.

405
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:56,962
Is that Santa's reindeer?

406
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,563
There's nothing up there.

407
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:11,507
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

408
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:15,113
You're my cookie,

409
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:19,820
and I could gobble you up.

410
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,559
Merry Christmas.

411
00:33:57,598 --> 00:33:59,828
Merry Christmas...

412
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,960
Hey. Merry Christmas.

413
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,767
She's my family now.

414
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:14,110
Agnes?

415
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:36,434
Billy!

416
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:37,631
What have you done?!

417
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:38,798
Where's Agnes?!

418
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,104
Billy, where's Agnes?

419
00:34:41,142 --> 00:34:43,110
What your mother
and I must know is...

420
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:45,203
Billy!

421
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:49,174
Where's Agnes?!

422
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,684
What have you done?

423
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:53,710
What have you done?

424
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:08,761
Little girl in the corner,
she's hurt.

425
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:10,595
Go check her out.

426
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:49,628
<i>Billy was declared insane.</i>

427
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:51,640
<i>They sent him away
to Clark Sanitarium.</i>

428
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:56,410
Paramedics saved his sister,
Agnes.

429
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:58,811
She lost her right eye.

430
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:02,909
All scarred up, mother murdered,
an inbred.

431
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:07,218
Her father, Billy,
who was her brother, Billy--

432
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,690
a fucking psycho.

433
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,852
They sent her to an orphanage.

434
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:13,589
Like, what chance did she have

435
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:16,063
that a foster family
would ever take her?

436
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:19,795
No one's seen her since.

437
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:31,345
Did they ever
find out from him

438
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,177
why he killed his family?

439
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:37,174
Well... it seemed to him

440
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:39,619
that's how they showed
their love.

441
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,691
Clair?

442
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,790
Megan?

443
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:08,582
Can we help you?

444
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:12,850
She was supposed to call.

445
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,250
I'm Clair's sister.

446
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,352
Where is she?

447
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:20,122
I'm kind of worried about Megan.

448
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,528
Who knows
what her deal is, okay?

449
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:23,031
- Can we go to my apartment?
- No. She was weird before.

450
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,432
I mean, she was a bitch to me,
and that's never happened.

451
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:27,163
And we've been getting
these weird phone calls,

452
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:28,761
one from her cell,

453
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,636
and her car's still outside,
and she's just, what,

454
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:31,970
gone in the middle
of this weather?

455
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,941
- Hey.
- Ow.

456
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:36,605
What, exactly,
are you looking for?

457
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,477
Like, a note or something
that says she's okay.

458
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:40,847
All her stuff is here,
and her car is outside.

459
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:43,682
Okay. Call her cell.

460
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,779
You're a legacy?

461
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:47,551
What year?

462
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,717
'93, '94, I don't know.

463
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:49,919
I started late, I quit early.

464
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,655
1993's the year
I became housemother.

465
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:53,060
I don't remember you.

466
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,326
I mean, this was supposed to be
such a big fucking weekend.

467
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:57,525
Excuse my language,
but I drove

468
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,432
all the way out here
in this shitty, shitty weather.

469
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:00,595
I blew off a weekend

470
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:01,604
in Vail with a cardiologist...

471
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,902
I love that coat.

472
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:14,682
Voice mail.

473
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,850
Meg, hi, it's Kel.

474
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,054
Um, look, I was just wondering
if you were okay, and, you know,

475
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:26,790
wanted to know what happened
to you and stuff, so...

476
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,628
can you just call me back,
please, on my cell?

477
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,566
Okay, bye.

478
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,349
Clair's name is "Crosby."

479
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,409
This says "Colvin."

480
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,421
The divorce will
be final in March.

481
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,683
What else do you need?

482
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,985
Look, I can't tell you
any secrets

483
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,686
about my sister, because
I don't really know her.

484
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,786
I-I-I can't tell you anything
about this place,

485
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:01,092
because I really fuckin'
hated it here.

486
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:03,031
Um...

487
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,332
I see Billy
still gets a Christmas present.

488
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,634
Oh, this is new.

489
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,299
It's not, uh...

490
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,242
for Billy,
it's for Alpha Kappa from Billy.

491
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,004
That wasn't here before.

492
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,951
Well, let's open it.

493
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,998
##

494
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,769
What if there's something
on her computer, like, uh,

495
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,605
an e-mail or something
that says where she is?

496
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,770
Hey, you know what?
I don't...

497
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,608
I don't feel comfortable.
uh, whatever, like,

498
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,478
invading someone's privacy
like this.

499
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,109
Try calling the police again.

500
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,188
Who put this under the tree?

501
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,190
She put it there.

502
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,783
She found it.

503
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,192
Are you actually giving me shit

504
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,197
when none of you can tell me
where my sister is, huh?

505
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,163
Where's her room?

506
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,963
Well, you know what that is?

507
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,129
The attic window's open.

508
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:14,968
What, you think she's up there?

509
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,208
You know her better than I do.

510
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:24,510
I'm her half-sister,
12 years older.

511
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,744
Clair was in, um...

512
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:31,153
I don't know, second grade
when I moved in here, this room.

513
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,647
It's weird how, at this age,
12 years seems like nothing.

514
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:39,152
In fact, in a weird way,
she seems older.

515
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,255
She was the one who wanted
to bridge that time,

516
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,631
finally get to know each other
while we could.

517
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:48,071
Can, you know, while we can.

518
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,973
Hey.

519
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,771
Same paper as the present
Eve gave me.

520
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,371
That paper's dated
December 26, 1991.

521
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:57,574
Eve lives in Billy's room.

522
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,175
Maybe she's, like,
obsessed with him.

523
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,149
I'm gonna go up to her room
and see if there's

524
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,313
any of that old newspaper
or anything up there.

525
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,118
Look, I'm tellin' you, it's
the window, Kelli, okay?

526
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,125
Can we just get up to the attic,
and I will close it.

527
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,364
Maybe she changed her mind
and just...

528
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,563
...left.

529
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:03,213
Look, this was before
you came here.

530
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:07,048
Okay? I did not put this
on the 'Net.

531
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,610
A guy at my work,
he got pissed off at me,

532
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,178
and he stole my tapes.

533
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:15,023
Tapes, Kyle?

534
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,154
How many are there,
you fucking liar?!

535
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:46,823
I can't even
believe that this person is you.

536
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,588
How could you do such a thing?

537
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:50,823
I saw you so different.

538
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,384
Get out!

539
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:20,325
Get the fuck out!

540
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:23,386
Am I gonna show up on there?

541
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,022
Isn't sex enough, Kyle?

542
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,498
You need little visual trophies
to get your thrill?

543
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,160
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

544
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:30,669
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Go, Kyle, now!

545
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,001
I got her, Ms. Mac.
It's okay, baby.

546
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:33,801
I got you.

547
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,239
Kelli, I really like you.

548
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:36,833
A lot.

549
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:38,843
I don't blame you
for hating me.

550
00:44:38,945 --> 00:44:40,674
But I wasn't dealing.

551
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:44,548
I wasn't knocking over
7-Elevens.

552
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:46,950
I didn't hurt anybody.

553
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:49,946
Yeah, Merry Christmas, asshole.

554
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,979
Fuck all you bitches.

555
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:53,185
Get out of here now!

556
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:55,285
Get out of here.

557
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:57,660
Go. Go!

558
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,443
Kelli...

559
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:21,115
Um, th-this is Clair's sister.

560
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:34,463
How fucked up is it that

561
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:37,470
the only other house on this
street has power?

562
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:39,836
This one doesn't.

563
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:42,101
You okay?

564
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:45,611
- Mel?
- Yeah?

565
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:48,842
You're a better sister to me
than my own sister.

566
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:50,712
Yeah, Dick Cheney's
a better sister to you

567
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,012
than your sister.

568
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:53,849
You know what I mean.

569
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,547
Yeah, I know. Ew.

570
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,351
I love you, too, but, honey,

571
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,652
you're really, really smelly.

572
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:00,455
You need to take a shower.
Can you handle it?

573
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:01,517
Mm-hmm.

574
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,153
Okay. Come on.

575
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:08,232
Oh, shit.

576
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,532
The main breaker's
underneath the house.

577
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,765
What? I'm not the totally
helpless daddy's girl

578
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:14,706
these bitches
make me out to be.

579
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:17,005
Okay, then go outside
and turn the power on.

580
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:18,442
Are you high?

581
00:46:18,478 --> 00:46:20,742
I'm not goin' outside.
It's freezing.

582
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,714
It'll take two seconds.

583
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:24,046
You know where the power is.

584
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:25,312
I'll keep looking for Clair.

585
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:26,716
Oh, fine.

586
00:46:31,024 --> 00:46:33,458
Ow.

587
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:44,332
I'm gonna go put a trash can
by your bed, okay?

588
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:33,011
Fuck.

589
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,236
You good, drunky?

590
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:53,672
Okay. No more drinking.

591
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,774
Okay, trash can's
right here, okay?

592
00:48:05,987 --> 00:48:09,445
Merry fuckin' Christmas.

593
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:47,719
Of course.

594
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:25,462
It's okay.

595
00:49:25,535 --> 00:49:28,527
Up in Eve's closet,
I found this, and these.

596
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:45,577
Clair?

597
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:59,161
Fuck you, Santa Claus.

598
00:50:33,069 --> 00:50:34,229
Eve, you crazy bitch.

599
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,931
I can see your breath.

600
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:05,228
It must be Kyle.

601
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:07,025
What do I do?

602
00:52:07,064 --> 00:52:09,055
Answer it.

603
00:52:15,973 --> 00:52:18,407
It says Dana's cell.

604
00:52:18,509 --> 00:52:19,533
Help!

605
00:52:21,612 --> 00:52:23,341
Help me. Help me.

606
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:25,143
She's my family now.

607
00:52:26,183 --> 00:52:27,548
Dana?

608
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:34,654
Dana, where are you?!

609
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,683
She went around back
to the fuse box.

610
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:43,023
Eve's car.

611
00:52:44,435 --> 00:52:46,460
She never left.

612
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:49,995
Heather, we have
to find Dana first!

613
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,132
Shit.

614
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:52,836
Dana!

615
00:52:52,876 --> 00:52:54,741
The fuse box
is under the house!

616
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:55,767
Dana!

617
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,110
Kelli!

618
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,915
Oh, my God.

619
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:13,194
Oh, and I can't open it!

620
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,698
Come on!

621
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:24,507
What's she doing,
sleeping in her car?

622
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,803
It's, like, zero degrees out.

623
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,151
Holy fuck!

624
00:53:45,162 --> 00:53:46,925
He's out here.

625
00:53:50,801 --> 00:53:52,928
What? What?

626
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:55,199
Damn it!

627
00:53:59,576 --> 00:54:01,373
Shit. Shit.

628
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:02,845
Come on.

629
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,373
Fuck!

630
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:08,951
What's going on?

631
00:54:08,986 --> 00:54:10,385
911 is experiencing

632
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:11,888
heavy caller traffic
because of the storm.

633
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:13,480
Hello?

634
00:54:13,524 --> 00:54:15,082
Hello. Yes, yes.

635
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,820
A girl is... is dead.

636
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,828
Outside.

637
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:20,762
Yes!

638
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:23,028
Yes, I know her.

639
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:25,331
Her name is Eve Agnew.

640
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:26,903
And we're positive
that she's been murdered.

641
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:30,070
He's home.

642
00:54:31,075 --> 00:54:33,236
No.

643
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:34,676
No, no, no, no, no, Ms. Mac.

644
00:54:34,712 --> 00:54:35,679
Billy is dead.

645
00:54:35,713 --> 00:54:37,112
And three other girls are...

646
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:39,115
Are missing. Missing.

647
00:54:39,149 --> 00:54:40,343
Are missing.

648
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:42,215
566 Oakdale.

649
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:44,345
We're the second house on the...

650
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:45,945
Right.

651
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:46,978
Alpha Kappa sorority.

652
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:49,322
Kelli Presley.

653
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,350
Wait, how long until...

654
00:54:51,428 --> 00:54:52,520
What?!

655
00:54:52,563 --> 00:54:53,621
No, no!

656
00:54:53,664 --> 00:54:55,529
We think he's still outside!

657
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:57,158
Would you wait
around that long

658
00:54:57,201 --> 00:54:58,259
after what I just told you?

659
00:54:58,302 --> 00:54:59,200
Get your purse!

660
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:00,863
Please, isn't there

661
00:55:00,904 --> 00:55:02,371
anything that you...

662
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:03,168
Goddamn it!

663
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:07,605
The storm.

664
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:10,738
Pile-ups over 91.

665
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:13,011
Reservists can't make it out

666
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,915
because the streets
are all ice.

667
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:17,349
Trees have fallen, and they said
they can maybe,

668
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,317
maybe be here in two hours.

669
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:22,891
Well, we're all gonna be
out of here in two minutes.

670
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:24,360
Get your things.

671
00:55:24,395 --> 00:55:25,885
- And what about Dana?
- We'll just go over

672
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,192
to the ADG house and get help.

673
00:55:27,232 --> 00:55:29,860
No, they-they've all gone home
or-or skiing.

674
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:31,425
Okay, okay,
whose family lives the closest,

675
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,901
just-just call them.

676
00:55:32,937 --> 00:55:34,029
Lauren, her mom lives in Boston.

677
00:55:34,072 --> 00:55:35,096
Even if we could

678
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,436
reach them on their cellphone,

679
00:55:36,474 --> 00:55:38,704
it would take four or five hours
before they got here.

680
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:39,573
Oh, shit, Lauren...

681
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:40,908
- Let's go.
- No.

682
00:55:40,945 --> 00:55:42,105
We stay together.

683
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:44,307
We lock up the house--
we got the fireplace poker,

684
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:46,783
a ski pole or some shit,
and for the next two hours

685
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:48,342
not let each other
out of our sights.

686
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,217
No. We are driving
to the police station.

687
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:51,722
- In this weather?
- Even if they can't

688
00:55:51,756 --> 00:55:54,088
do anything, at least
we will all be safe there.

689
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,956
Yeah, and we're not all here!

690
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:58,155
If we were, then I would go.

691
00:55:58,196 --> 00:55:59,128
That's right.

692
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:03,926
Unless I see otherwise, I'm
believing that Clair is alive.

693
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:08,962
<i>And when she comes back, it is
not gonna be to an empty house.</i>

694
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:11,703
We are safer
sticking together.

695
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,871
All right, then get your coats.

696
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,813
Mel, come on, we're leaving!
Let's go!

697
00:56:16,848 --> 00:56:19,248
I'm not leaving Lauren,
you bitch!

698
00:56:19,284 --> 00:56:21,411
We're sisters...

699
00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:23,420
so act like it.

700
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:37,656
We'll get the police here
as soon as we can.

701
00:56:40,705 --> 00:56:42,036
Let's go.

702
00:57:21,846 --> 00:57:22,938
Whoa!

703
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,846
We can't see the car.

704
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:27,043
Maybe from Lauren's room?

705
00:57:40,198 --> 00:57:42,291
Open up, please, Mrs. Mac.

706
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,604
Oh, come on, you piece of shit.

707
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:02,913
Come on.

708
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,462
They got the car started.

709
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,225
Go, go, go.

710
00:58:13,665 --> 00:58:14,563
All right.

711
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:15,793
What are you doing?

712
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:17,699
Here you go.

713
00:58:17,736 --> 00:58:19,465
What is that thing?

714
00:58:19,504 --> 00:58:22,962
Are you kidding?

715
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:28,039
Privileged bitch.

716
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,604
Frigid Southern princess.

717
00:58:30,649 --> 00:58:33,311
# Good tidings for Christmas,
and a... #

718
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:55,904
Why aren't they leaving?

719
00:58:55,941 --> 00:58:57,169
Should we go check on them?

720
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,268
Let's go.
Stay with your friend.

721
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,415
Kelli?

722
00:59:39,151 --> 00:59:41,415
Kelli!

723
00:59:43,256 --> 00:59:44,518
Kelli?

724
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:55,699
Come on!

725
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:57,895
Fucking window!

726
01:00:32,138 --> 01:00:33,969
It's blocked.

727
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:39,403
Come on. Come on.

728
01:00:42,524 --> 01:00:43,422
Oh, God.

729
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:46,450
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

730
01:00:58,173 --> 01:00:59,697
Go!

731
01:00:59,942 --> 01:01:02,240
- Lauren, where's Mel?
- Shut up.

732
01:01:02,278 --> 01:01:04,109
- Where is Melissa?
- He'll hear you.

733
01:01:39,715 --> 01:01:41,444
Oh, my God... Kyle!

734
01:01:41,484 --> 01:01:42,849
Stop! It's me!

735
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:50,787
No!

736
01:01:56,832 --> 01:01:58,094
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

737
01:01:58,134 --> 01:01:59,624
There are two bodies
in the driveway.

738
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:00,794
- Maybe you did it!
- No!

739
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:01,666
Maybe you did that!

740
01:02:01,704 --> 01:02:03,035
It wasn't... him.

741
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:04,164
How do you know?

742
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:48,507
Where's Agnes?

743
01:02:48,551 --> 01:02:51,884
What have you done... Billy?

744
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:54,253
She's my family now.

745
01:02:59,062 --> 01:03:01,895
He's in the attic...

746
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:04,593
and I hear
someone else.

747
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:19,742
Hey, hey, no fucking way.

748
01:03:19,782 --> 01:03:20,908
Let's go.

749
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,713
Clair might be alive--
she might be up there.

750
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:24,117
No, Eve's not,
Heather's not, Ms. Mac...

751
01:03:24,153 --> 01:03:26,087
I heard more than one voice
on those phone calls.

752
01:03:26,122 --> 01:03:27,487
And I have searched
the whole house.

753
01:03:27,523 --> 01:03:29,491
And I've seen under it.
Where else could he be?

754
01:03:29,525 --> 01:03:32,359
Until I see that she's dead,
she is alive.

755
01:03:32,696 --> 01:03:35,062
This is Billy fucking Lenz
we're talking about here, okay?

756
01:03:35,098 --> 01:03:36,793
He's probably listening to us
right now.

757
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,301
Yeah, and if I had a sister, I
would expect her to go up there.

758
01:03:39,336 --> 01:03:40,769
How would you know?
You don't have a sister.

759
01:03:40,804 --> 01:03:42,101
She does.

760
01:03:46,476 --> 01:03:48,740
Now, let's go.

761
01:03:48,779 --> 01:03:49,541
Wait.

762
01:03:49,646 --> 01:03:51,238
If we go up there,

763
01:03:51,281 --> 01:03:53,146
the second we see they're dead,

764
01:03:53,183 --> 01:03:54,810
we run the fuck
out of this house.

765
01:04:46,903 --> 01:04:50,304
I open the door,
and you hit the light.

766
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,807
Okay?

767
01:04:51,842 --> 01:04:53,139
Okay.

768
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:17,422
One, two...

769
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,294
Kyle! Kyle!

770
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:16,384
No... no... no!

771
01:06:16,427 --> 01:06:18,759
No...!

772
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:19,761
God, no!

773
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:21,195
Clair!

774
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:22,130
No!

775
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:38,712
No! No!

776
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:40,011
Oh, no! No!

777
01:06:40,051 --> 01:06:43,316
He's my family now.

778
01:06:43,354 --> 01:06:45,254
No! No...!

779
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:47,519
No! Leigh!

780
01:06:47,558 --> 01:06:48,354
No! No!

781
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:07,743
Everyone should be
home for Christmas.

782
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,586
Holy...

783
01:07:40,778 --> 01:07:43,178
You're my family now.

784
01:07:43,214 --> 01:07:44,476
No!

785
01:07:44,515 --> 01:07:45,504
Come on!

786
01:07:45,549 --> 01:07:46,914
No!

787
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,915
No!

788
01:07:56,193 --> 01:07:59,128
No! No!

789
01:08:01,198 --> 01:08:03,029
Fuck!

790
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,073
They're not your family.

791
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:51,515
Agnes.

792
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:56,550
I'm not your family.

793
01:08:56,588 --> 01:08:59,022
And your brother's not here.

794
01:08:59,057 --> 01:09:02,026
No, my daddy's here.

795
01:09:22,614 --> 01:09:23,808
No!

796
01:09:47,005 --> 01:09:48,495
Leigh!

797
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:53,467
Leigh!

798
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,409
Leigh!

799
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:00,008
Help me. Help!

800
01:10:00,052 --> 01:10:01,952
Help me! Please!

801
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:04,353
I'm in the wall, please!

802
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,357
Leigh!

803
01:10:05,391 --> 01:10:07,291
I'm in the wall!

804
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:09,760
Help! Help! Help!

805
01:10:10,396 --> 01:10:12,227
Kelli?!

806
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,560
Help! Help!

807
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:16,625
I'm below you!

808
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:18,728
Below you!

809
01:10:20,272 --> 01:10:21,967
Help! Help! I'm down here!

810
01:10:23,442 --> 01:10:25,034
Help me!

811
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:28,205
Help me!

812
01:10:31,116 --> 01:10:34,176
Help! Help! Help me, please!

813
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:38,487
Kelli!

814
01:10:38,524 --> 01:10:41,015
Help me.
Billy's in the fucking wall.

815
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:41,992
Leigh!

816
01:10:42,027 --> 01:10:44,996
Oh! Help me!

817
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:49,798
Leigh!

818
01:10:52,638 --> 01:10:54,037
Please, please!

819
01:10:54,073 --> 01:10:55,370
Please!

820
01:10:58,377 --> 01:10:59,503
Help! Help!

821
01:10:59,545 --> 01:11:01,410
Kelli!

822
01:11:50,029 --> 01:11:53,021
Dr. Forest, dial 118, please.

823
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:56,364
Dr. Forest, please dial 118...

824
01:11:56,402 --> 01:11:58,495
All right,
good to go.

825
01:11:58,537 --> 01:12:00,164
Still more questions
than answers tonight

826
01:12:00,205 --> 01:12:02,264
at Clement University Hospital,

827
01:12:02,307 --> 01:12:05,276
on what should have been a
typically quiet Christmas Eve.

828
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,938
Earlier, escaped notorious
murderer Billy Lenz,

829
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,641
along with his sister Agnes--

830
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:12,412
unaccounted for since her recent
release from Woodville--

831
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:14,316
together went on
a murderous rampage...

832
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,618
No, I'm the only one here.

833
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:19,989
What about the M.E.?

834
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:21,926
M.E. barely made it in.

835
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:23,452
Are you gonna be home soon?

836
01:12:23,496 --> 01:12:24,895
No, I won't be home
till after noon.

837
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:28,389
Well, 'cause he wants us to
identify all the bodies,

838
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:30,232
and we've only done two.

839
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:31,999
Remember when we talked
about this last night?

840
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:34,131
Uh-huh.

841
01:12:34,174 --> 01:12:35,141
- Don't you?
- Yes.

842
01:12:35,175 --> 01:12:37,040
You know what day it is?

843
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:39,238
Of course I know what day it is;
the kids'll have to wait.

844
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:40,405
It's Christmas, jerk.

845
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,005
Fuck!

846
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:43,538
Bitch.

847
01:12:45,218 --> 01:12:48,585
Think I want to be doing
this on Christmas?

848
01:12:48,622 --> 01:12:50,886
I'm doing my frickin' job.

849
01:12:53,259 --> 01:12:54,783
Mmm.

850
01:12:59,633 --> 01:13:01,999
Ooh, yes, sir.

851
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:14,842
What the fuck?

852
01:13:43,576 --> 01:13:46,636
Holy shit.

853
01:13:53,153 --> 01:13:54,518
No, no!

854
01:14:00,527 --> 01:14:03,496
How long could they have
been in the house for?

855
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:06,055
Months? Years?

856
01:14:06,132 --> 01:14:09,568
We're not gonna know that now.

857
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:11,502
We're never gonna know.

858
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,443
I'm not gonna be able to open
this in front of...

859
01:14:27,487 --> 01:14:29,785
my sister, so...

860
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,000
Baby...

861
01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:05,089
Doctor wants some more
X-rays, and the technician's

862
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,754
about to go home and
won't be in tomorrow.

863
01:15:57,778 --> 01:15:59,746
Kelli?

864
01:16:06,721 --> 01:16:09,019
Kelli?

865
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:14,019
I thought they took you
to get your X-rays.

866
01:16:15,429 --> 01:16:18,193
You okay?

867
01:16:18,232 --> 01:16:19,756
No!

868
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,893
Forever!

869
01:16:25,306 --> 01:16:27,206
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Leigh?

870
01:16:27,241 --> 01:16:29,232
I don't know. Restroom, maybe?

871
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:39,808
They were supposed to
have someone fix this.

872
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,410
Leigh?

873
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,227
# Deck the halls
with boughs of holly #

874
01:18:01,269 --> 01:18:04,102
# Fa la la la la
la la la la #

875
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,664
# 'Tis the season to be jolly #

876
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:10,303
# Fa la la la la
la la la la... #

877
01:18:10,345 --> 01:18:12,370
Open the door!

878
01:18:12,414 --> 01:18:15,144
Please, somebody, help!
Open the door.

879
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:21,587
Oh, God.

880
01:18:21,623 --> 01:18:24,558
Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.

881
01:18:29,231 --> 01:18:31,392
Come on!

882
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:32,923
No!

883
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,243
Oh, fuck.

884
01:19:11,573 --> 01:19:13,734
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

885
01:19:37,532 --> 01:19:38,499
No!
