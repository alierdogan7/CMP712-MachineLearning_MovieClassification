1
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:51,389
Move, Nidon. Move!

2
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:55,026
Brother Nidon, report to the Chapel...
Guard the Codex!

3
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,799
I must protect the relic
in the Emperor's Holy name.

4
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:01,171
I must protect the relic.

5
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,979
I must protect the relic...

6
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:21,152
It is the forty-first millennium.

7
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:25,995
In the grim darkness of the far future,
there is only war.

8
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:31,362
The Emperor of Mankind
wages a constant battle

9
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:35,239
to protect humanity
from the horrors of space.

10
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:40,679
On the fringes of the Imperium,
alien races lurk and plot,

11
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:45,583
and Chaos daemons leak into our reality
from the torment of the Warp.

12
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:51,080
All that stands in their way
are the mighty Space Marines.

13
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,558
They are more than mortal.

14
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:57,586
They are steel and they are doom.

15
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:01,692
They are the champions of Mankind.

16
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:06,365
And the greatest of them all
are the Ultramarines.

17
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,579
Chaos breaks men's souls.

18
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:51,106
Chaos brings the pestilence of daemons.

19
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:59,147
Every time we march from
our beloved fortress home on Macragge...

20
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:07,158
we march to face down Chaos...

21
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,395
and banish it.

22
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:20,044
Do you think you're ready to do that,
Proteus?

23
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,248
Yes, Captain. I do.

24
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:44,764
Do you yield to me, Captain Severus?

25
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:46,431
Remove your helm!

26
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,473
Yield to me!

27
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,104
You fight well, Proteus.

28
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:53,078
Do you yield to me?

29
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,953
Victory is mine, Proteus.

30
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:06,422
We never yield.

31
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,910
You must be steel.

32
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:30,580
You must be doom.

33
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:34,610
You must use everything you've got.

34
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:38,055
Chaos has no honor.

35
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,716
Close in!

36
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,025
No more drills, no more practice.

37
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:50,930
You are about to receive the honor

38
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:56,603
of going into combat for the first time
as Ultramarines.

39
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,907
- Brother Pythol.
- Captain Severus.

40
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:26,096
You shall make your battle pledges
upon this sacred warhammer.

41
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:33,737
This hallowed weapon has fought
in the hands of our greatest veterans,

42
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,443
it has slain alien beasts and daemons alike.

43
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:42,253
One day you may be worthy enough
to wield it.

44
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:45,985
Until then you may kneel before it.

45
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:55,733
We march for Macragge.

46
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,896
And we shall know no fear!

47
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,817
Sergeant Crastor.

48
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:52,456
Look to your battle gear
and it will protect you.

49
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,221
We guard it with our lives.

50
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,922
As your armor guards your life.

51
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:00,956
As it has - my fallen brethren.

52
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,900
Honor the craft of death.

53
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:05,336
We serve only the Emperor.

54
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:09,398
Honor the battle gear of the dead.

55
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:12,605
We ask only to serve.

56
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:48,681
So, a shooting war, you think?

57
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,376
A real one this time?

58
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:55,080
Maybe, Verenor,
if the Emperor is smiling on us.

59
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,055
Pray that he is.

60
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,059
My belly growls for a taste of actual combat.

61
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,254
Any word of the drop?

62
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:07,528
Probably just another false alarm,
brother Hypax.

63
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:11,059
- Like Algol.
- Algol.

64
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,434
There wasn't even a scrap of glory
for us there.

65
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:18,671
So eager to die?

66
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,943
Glory is a two-edged blade.

67
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:27,544
You shy away from combat, Pythol?

68
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,782
Oh, Proteus...

69
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:33,292
You novices are all alike.

70
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:36,693
And I'm the one
who has to put you back together.

71
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:39,391
It isn't combat I resent, brother,

72
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,560
it's the thirst for glory
that gets men cut to ribbons.

73
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:44,968
Look at you.

74
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,768
You all look so very fine,

75
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,640
and I do not doubt the fire in your hearts,

76
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:53,908
but you do not yet know war as I do.

77
00:08:55,548 --> 00:09:01,350
Well, with respect, that is why we are here.

78
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:06,758
We do not want to go back to Macragge
empty-handed.

79
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:11,526
I know.
Just don't be in such a hurry.

80
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:14,624
Death will find you soon enough.

81
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,262
War is not about glory.

82
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:21,239
War is about victory.

83
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:24,607
Looks like
you are going to get your fight after all.

84
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:55,604
With your strength you protect me.

85
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:59,703
With My care I repair you.

86
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:04,308
With sacred oil I appease you.

87
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,444
Be quiet, good spirits.

88
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:19,321
All Servitors to complete
ammunition blessings and leave the hangar.

89
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,890
Thunderhawk clear for take-off.

90
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,130
Lock in!

91
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,773
I will serve the Golden Throne of Terra,

92
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:36,578
for the wings of Aquila will shield me,

93
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:40,052
for the Emperor protects...

94
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:42,111
Pre launch position.

95
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,948
Descent window 84-40.

96
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,352
This backwater is called Mithron...

97
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:18,414
There is only one significant site
on this planet.

98
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,018
An Imperial shrine

99
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,393
guarded by a detachment of Space Marines

100
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,333
from our fellow Chapter, the Imperial Fists.

101
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,634
Captain Severus,
do they respond to our astropaths?

102
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,937
No, Hypax, they do not.

103
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:39,138
However, an emergency beacon
is still transmitting.

104
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,544
Well, then someone's still alive, Captain.

105
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:45,380
The beacon, brother Proteus,
may be on auto-cycle.

106
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,950
What size was the Imperial Fist
contingent, Captain?

107
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,589
Data says one hundred battle-brothers.

108
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:02,931
A full company,
and we're just a dozen strong.

109
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:08,373
The nearest fighting unit
is six weeks away, Pythol.

110
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,672
This one belongs to us.

111
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:24,821
First blood will be mine.

112
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,052
In your dreams.

113
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:32,594
If I get there first,
there will be no blood left for you two to spill.

114
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:35,430
If you get there first.

115
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,436
Still so eager to be heroes?

116
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,405
Someone has to be, apothecary.

117
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,601
I heard you turned the job down.

118
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,984
Beacon signal located.
Thirty kilometers to shrine site.

119
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,436
- Site visual.
- Show me.

120
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,386
That weather pattern
is directly above the shrine, Captain.

121
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,854
Set us down here.

122
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,000
We march for Macragge!

123
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,332
And we shall know no fear!

124
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:15,766
Deploy! Deploy!

125
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,792
Proteus! Right sweep!

126
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:21,034
Verenor! Left! Cover the angles!

127
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,346
Full scan!

128
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:35,446
The Emperor protects,
but it does no harm to double-check!

129
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,164
Crastor! Gun-seat! Scope ahead!

130
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,468
Yes, Captain!

131
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,328
Not natural, Captain.

132
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:20,059
- Weather expert now, Pythol?
- No, Captain.

133
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:25,003
Ultima Squad! Form up!

134
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:28,473
Pilot, extraction here in two hours.

135
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,376
Keep a good spread.

136
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,887
Crastor? Status?

137
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,366
Clear six hundred meters, sir. Standby.

138
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:32,867
Drop the speed, Lycos.

139
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,900
You see something?

140
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:39,775
No. Just got a feeling.

141
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,567
Something wrong?

142
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:08,198
- Can you hear that, Hypax?
- Hear what?

143
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,209
Voices. In the wind.

144
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,438
Just vox distortion.

145
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:16,312
Proteus is hearing voices!

146
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,408
Probably that smack to the head.

147
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,553
Wait here!

148
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:20,473
- Boreas!
- Holy Throne!

149
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:23,311
- Be vigilant, brothers!
- Put it out! Put it out, now!

150
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,977
Be calm! It's just corposant!

151
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,211
Verenor is right.

152
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:33,453
It's just corposant. Bale-fire.
The weather's doing it.

153
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:47,235
It is a bad omen is what it is.

154
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:50,765
Think silently, Pythol.

155
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,711
Simply reflecting, Captain.
A bad omen.

156
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:56,180
Just bale-fire, Pythol.

157
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:58,843
I thought you were the weather expert.

158
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:03,150
This is impetuous.
We do not know what we're walking into.

159
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:07,489
Do we ever?
We're the Emperor's chosen, my friend.

160
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:09,721
Of course, Captain.

161
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:22,207
- Captain?
- Go ahead, Crastor.

162
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,472
- We have reached the edge of the storm.
- Anything to report?

163
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,103
Scopes are blind.

164
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:30,775
Visibility is shut right down.
Do you want us to advance?

165
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,341
Negative. Hold your position.

166
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,876
Acknowledged.

167
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,767
- Something's wrong...
- What?

168
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,296
You really don't hear that?

169
00:19:58,878 --> 00:19:59,970
There!

170
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,443
Lycos! Punch it!

171
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:08,214
Cease fire! Cease fire!

172
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,247
Who was that?
Verenor?

173
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,850
Proteus discharged his weapon, Captain.

174
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,819
Brother Proteus, report!

175
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:20,860
There's something here, Captain.
Something shadowing us.

176
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,630
I ran an auspex sweep, Captain.
There is nothing.

177
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,070
- I saw something!
- What?

178
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:28,471
I'll tell you what.

179
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:32,807
The effects of first-time nerves
on the trigger-finger, that's what!

180
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:34,904
I saw something, Captain!

181
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,956
- Captain?
- False alarm, Crastor.

182
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:48,386
Pull yourself together.

183
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:51,260
There will be plenty to shoot at
soon enough.

184
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:02,699
When command is mine,
I will not tolerate weak links.

185
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,574
He will be ready when it counts.

186
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,923
Ultima Squad vox test. Call off.

187
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,123
- Lycos, aye.
- Crastor, aye.

188
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,791
- Junor, aye.
- Maxillius, aye.

189
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:29,266
- Remulus, aye.
- Boreas, aye.

190
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,826
- Decius, aye.
- Verenor, aye.

191
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,737
- Hypax, aye.
- Proteus, aye.

192
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,072
Pythol, aye.
Squad is aye, Captain.

193
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:56,544
Captain! Captain Severus!

194
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,582
Great Terra!

195
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,666
Imperial Fists.

196
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,765
5th Company.

197
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:51,799
The shrine guard.

198
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:58,246
Dead. Decayed.
Nothing left to save...

199
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,751
This is desecration.

200
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,983
This is vile desecration.

201
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:10,661
This is the handiwork of Chaos.

202
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:16,056
Continuing with this mission
would not be an act of valor.

203
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,668
It would be a waste of this squad...

204
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:23,163
in your opinion, apothecary.

205
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:27,569
We have an obligation
to warn the Chapter House.

206
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:32,414
Your courageous recommendation
is noted, Pythol.

207
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:36,148
- Crastor, scout ahead.
- Yes, Captain.

208
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:39,385
Do we still have a fix on that beacon?

209
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,892
Fix is still clean, Captain.

210
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:49,828
That beacon may lead us
to someone who can...

211
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,862
..explain.

212
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:46,323
There was no valor in this end.

213
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:50,158
They gave their lives
in the service of the Emperor.

214
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,459
That is valor enough for me.

215
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,179
- Crastor, report!
- First bridge ahead, Captain.

216
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,467
Crastor's halted, Captain.

217
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:35,632
Crastor? Lycos? Report.

218
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,347
Verenor, advance with me.

219
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,547
- Captain, I...
- Verenor, I said.

220
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:53,080
Stay here, Proteus.
Keep the squad here.

221
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:14,375
Crastor? Lycos?

222
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,547
Throne of Terra!

223
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:28,453
Take cover!

224
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:50,480
Supporting fire!

225
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,393
- Come on!
- The Captain ordered us to hold position!

226
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,796
- The Captain is in trouble!
- Boreas! Hold fast!

227
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,366
Boreas!

228
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,664
- You intact?
- Yes, Captain.

229
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,833
First blood to you, Verenor.

230
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,571
So, now we know our enemy.

231
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,004
Chaos Space Marines.

232
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:44,057
Yes, Chaos indeed.

233
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,022
Black Legion.

234
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,445
Tell me.

235
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,050
Three.

236
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,889
Crastor and Lycos.
Boreas.

237
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:19,523
- Outright?
- Yes, Captain.

238
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:28,706
- Permission to extract their gene-seed.
- Granted.

239
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:35,645
May the Emperor bless and protect
this sacred legacy,

240
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,413
so that the strength of these brave warriors
may live on in Ultramarines as yet unborn.

241
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,417
For the abiding honor
of our fortress home, Macragge,

242
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:50,921
in the name of the Chapter
and the Primarch, to whom we owe all.

243
00:30:52,664 --> 00:30:55,258
We shall mourn them later,

244
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,894
if the Emperor grants us time.

245
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:02,036
Who is to carry this now?

246
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:06,304
- I will, Captain.
- Is that so, Proteus?

247
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,949
No.

248
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,850
- Hypax.
- Yes, Captain.

249
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:17,650
You carry that safe.

250
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,122
I will.

251
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:54,655
If anything happens to me,
you know my wishes.

252
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:57,059
- Captain, I...
- Do not argue.

253
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:58,960
We are dying.

254
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:03,866
Sergeant Crastor is gone,
and I am not miraculously exempt.

255
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:26,154
Verenor! Proteus!

256
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,455
Secure an entry point!

257
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:48,907
- Can you make that?
- Of course I can make that.

258
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:10,564
- The next one is further.
- Then let me show you how it is done!

259
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:31,246
Come on!

260
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:46,267
- Grab my hand!
- Your hand is not required!

261
00:33:58,717 --> 00:34:00,685
Blocked.

262
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,088
- You made a kill?
- Yes.

263
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,624
Black Legion, so the Captain said.

264
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,660
Hard to believe they were like us once.

265
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:21,806
If it is tainted by the Warp,
corrupted by Chaos, I will kill it.

266
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:26,468
The Warp is cunning and insidious.

267
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:31,073
- Are you sure you will recognize it?
- Just follow my lead, Proteus.

268
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:10,844
- What?
- I think I saw something.

269
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,686
Think you saw something?

270
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:26,368
Captain? We have secured a way in.

271
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,634
Good, Verenor. Stand by.

272
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,577
Keep it tight.

273
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:33,858
Head wound, fatal.
Hostiles!

274
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,607
Daemon!

275
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:50,773
Kill it!

276
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:02,120
Up there!

277
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:42,791
Get the squad back!

278
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:55,843
Proteus! Take the Chain Sword!

279
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,727
Captain!

280
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:53,030
Now we know what is here.
Death and daemons.

281
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:57,340
We need to get a report back to Macragge.

282
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,503
Pray we live long enough
to get back to the transport.

283
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:03,013
We are not going back to the transport.

284
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:05,311
Throne of Terra! Are you insane?

285
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:08,011
And since when
did you make the decisions, Proteus?

286
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:12,011
- Tell him, Pythol! Tell him I...
- The Captain was quite clear.

287
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,684
Command should go to Proteus.

288
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,764
I say we go back. So say your brothers.

289
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:29,166
The beacon is still sending.

290
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:32,267
It's on auto-cycle!

291
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,937
There is a chance it is not.

292
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:45,079
- We march for Macragge!
- And we shall know no fear!

293
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:49,219
Brother Hypax?

294
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,560
That standard catches light.
You warn me.

295
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:55,697
Aye, Proteus.

296
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:41,905
Hold your fire!

297
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:49,676
In the name of the Emperor,
identify yourself!

298
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,952
Carnak. Chaplain of the Imperial Fists.

299
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:57,056
How many are you?

300
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,528
This is Nidon.

301
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:06,895
Well, Nidon can point his weapon
somewhere else.

302
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,201
Anymore?

303
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:14,802
We are here to get you out.

304
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:19,209
Not us.

305
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:49,470
The Liber Mithrus.

306
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:52,846
The sacred Codex of this shrine.

307
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:57,218
The Emperor himself entrusted it to us
at our Chapter's founding.

308
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:02,983
Countless generations have stood here.

309
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:07,430
Our purpose, to protect it
from the abominations of the Warp.

310
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:18,531
No one touches the relic.

311
00:43:18,576 --> 00:43:23,878
Brother Nidon is responsible
for carrying and defending the tome.

312
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:30,181
He takes his responsibilities very seriously.

313
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:32,587
My apologies.

314
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,784
How long have you been here, Chaplain?

315
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:38,124
Since long before the darkness fell.

316
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:42,758
- What happened?
- They assaulted the shrine.

317
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,295
We fought for three weeks,
all the while transmitting requests for aid.

318
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:53,140
Then some horror was unleashed.

319
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:55,805
A Warp Gate must have opened

320
00:43:55,846 --> 00:44:01,011
and through it,
vile legions of demonic furies descended...

321
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:04,687
You have seen the results.

322
00:44:05,656 --> 00:44:08,090
But how did you survive?

323
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:12,059
I have no comforting answer, battle-brother.

324
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:18,268
All I know is that we must
get this sacred artifact to safety.

325
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,087
Nidon?

326
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,092
Steady...

327
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:50,597
My name is Verenor, brother.
It is time to move out.

328
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:12,282
I confess, Chaplain, I was beginning
to doubt our mission's purpose.

329
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:16,424
Everything has a purpose, Proteus.

330
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:20,230
So the Emperor ordains.

331
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:07,068
Those two worry me.

332
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:09,136
They have been through a lot.

333
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,341
Too much, if you ask me.

334
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:16,617
How did the two of them survive?
I don't like it, Proteus.

335
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,884
What are you saying, brother?

336
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:23,357
How can we know they are not...

337
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:25,487
tainted?

338
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:28,760
That is a serious accusation.

339
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:32,633
We are taught that Chaos corrupts,
eats away at you from the inside.

340
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,538
You never know
who may fall victim to its touch.

341
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:40,010
And they've been cut off in this hell pit
for how long?

342
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:43,738
Keep your eye on them.

343
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:46,375
Oh, I intend to.

344
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:47,637
Slaughter them!

345
00:47:54,652 --> 00:47:56,085
Here they come.

346
00:47:57,855 --> 00:48:00,551
Move, Ultima! Transport is waiting.

347
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:06,487
Pilot, prepare for immediate extraction!

348
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,191
Acknowledged.

349
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:15,197
- You must be happy.
- I'll be happier when we're gone.

350
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:23,874
Proteus!

351
00:48:24,515 --> 00:48:26,449
Proteus?

352
00:48:29,186 --> 00:48:31,416
Ultima Squad.
Rally to me.

353
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:34,755
- Vox test.
- Carnak, aye.

354
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:37,386
- Nidon, aye.
- Junor, aye.

355
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:40,727
- Hypax, aye.
- Verenor, aye.

356
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:44,165
- Remulus, aye.
- Decius, aye.

357
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,762
- Pythol, aye.
- Squad is aye, Proteus.

358
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,508
Defend and advance only on my command.

359
00:48:55,446 --> 00:48:58,210
There is higher ground.

360
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,274
This was planned.

361
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,582
They'll be expecting us to take that position,

362
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:06,613
but I doubt they will be expecting
a Chaplain.

363
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:11,026
I would not be so sure.

364
00:49:33,717 --> 00:49:36,709
The Emperor protects.

365
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:39,882
But having a loaded bolter never hurt, either.

366
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:47,387
Kill the Imperium scum!

367
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:50,364
For the Emperor!

368
00:50:38,482 --> 00:50:39,540
Attack!

369
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:45,482
Chaplain, have you not a weapon?

370
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:56,557
Burn, Heretic!

371
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,850
Ultima Squad.
To the ridge line.

372
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:30,425
- Are you hit?
- It is nothing...

373
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,803
More of them!

374
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:56,589
- Is the Crozius ready?
- No, it needs more time!

375
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:09,873
I fear no evil, I fear no death
for the Emperor will protect me!

376
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,975
Spill their blood!

377
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,767
Junor!

378
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:44,603
Fall back!

379
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:06,024
They are coming in for the kill.

380
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:37,617
Captain Severus!

381
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:47,597
Captain!

382
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:11,986
Praise the Emperor!

383
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:14,964
Follow the Captain! Follow his lead!

384
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,849
- Captain!
- Proteus.

385
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:46,454
- How are you alive?
- The Emperor protects.

386
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:49,795
Come on! Extraction is waiting!

387
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:51,323
Move out!

388
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:39,298
Proteus. Report.

389
00:56:40,243 --> 00:56:44,680
We're maneuvering to leave orbit, Captain.
Drive is set to fire in ten minutes.

390
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:49,674
And then a straight voyage
back to Macragge.

391
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:54,482
I can't wait to see the Chapter House.

392
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:58,051
Something else, Proteus?

393
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,027
Speak your mind.

394
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:07,094
How do you recognize the taint of Chaos?

395
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:12,370
We have a Chaplain with us.
Let him sniff out taint.

396
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:15,473
It is the Chaplain that I am worried about.

397
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:19,606
- Where is he?
- The armory, Captain.

398
00:57:32,062 --> 00:57:34,963
Chaplain Carnak?

399
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,660
Captain Severus?

400
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:40,192
A moment, please.

401
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:47,640
I am a Captain of the Ultramarines Chapter

402
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,838
and this is my vessel,

403
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,677
so put that away.

404
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:01,055
This is improper, Severus.

405
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:03,218
Indulge me.

406
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,410
The Codex is empty?

407
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,610
Do you see?

408
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:28,550
This is what has burdened me!

409
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:30,951
I thought it was Chaos' trickery!

410
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:33,217
This is deceit.

411
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:34,848
Heresy.

412
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:38,190
I don't know the purpose or the point,

413
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:42,324
but I know evil when I taste it.

414
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:44,299
This is your work.

415
00:58:45,335 --> 00:58:48,498
Captain, you are making a mistake.

416
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:55,970
No mistake, daemon.

417
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:00,575
No! You...

418
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:03,984
Heretic!

419
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:14,154
Be resolute in the face of heresy.

420
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:18,531
Deal with it
before it's demonic force can manifest.

421
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:36,484
If the daemon is dead,
why is this still burning?

422
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:52,267
Daemon!

423
01:00:11,955 --> 01:00:15,721
We couldn't have done it without you.

424
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:22,263
Mithron was a trap.

425
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:28,796
Why else would I have left the Chaplain
and his lackey alive?

426
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:32,939
Begone!

427
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:40,349
No!

428
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:49,686
Main engines start in five minutes.

429
01:01:02,572 --> 01:01:06,474
Proteus, can you walk?

430
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:18,314
What in Throne's name?

431
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:21,415
We have five minutes to kill your Captain

432
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:27,397
or this ship will be delivering a daemon
directly to your precious Macragge...

433
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:30,691
thanks to Proteus.

434
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:49,017
The daemon!

435
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,897
Brother Pythol!

436
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:13,437
- Brother Pythol.
- The Captain...

437
01:02:13,476 --> 01:02:17,310
Our Captain died on Mithron.

438
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:20,612
Tell me, which way did it go?

439
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:28,014
The reclusiam.

440
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:38,390
Main engines start in four minutes.

441
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:49,003
Take this and follow my lead.

442
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:59,718
Proteus, left side.
Nidon, with me.

443
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:23,303
Main engines start in three minutes.

444
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:41,826
That codex is a Warp Gate,
it will destroy Macragge!

445
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:44,732
Then we must destroy this beast, now.

446
01:03:58,615 --> 01:04:00,242
Above. Up there.

447
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,909
Jammed!

448
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,688
There!

449
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:30,074
Proteus. Draw it out.

450
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:02,469
Main engines start in two minutes.

451
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:04,547
Come out...

452
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:07,240
Come out.

453
01:05:09,252 --> 01:05:10,776
Come out, daemon.

454
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:14,947
Show yourself.

455
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:21,796
Macragge first...

456
01:05:22,832 --> 01:05:28,793
and then we shall destroy a million worlds...

457
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:33,698
I need new flesh to wear.

458
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:39,671
Yours, I think.

459
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:50,519
Imagine how they will whisper your name...

460
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:56,465
..after you walk into your Chapter House,
your precious Macragge,

461
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:58,592
holding this great trophy aloft.

462
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:04,161
Think of the glory, Proteus.

463
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:10,245
Forget glory! Get up and kill this beast!

464
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,374
I can't take it alone!

465
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:38,065
Yield to me.

466
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:43,007
Yield.

467
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:35,896
Main engines start in one minute.

468
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,996
One minute Proteus,

469
01:07:40,036 --> 01:07:44,769
and your death will have no purpose.

470
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:47,640
Everything has a purpose.

471
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:50,271
The Emperor ordains it so.

472
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:53,978
You may corrupt the souls of men,

473
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:58,018
but I am steel!

474
01:07:59,622 --> 01:08:01,385
I am doom!

475
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:07,625
I march for Macragge.

476
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:10,164
And I know no fear.

477
01:08:30,153 --> 01:08:32,781
How can I ever explain

478
01:08:32,822 --> 01:08:36,189
what I have done to the sacred reliquary?

479
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:44,165
Brother Proteus,
it will be an honor to help explain.

480
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:49,529
Engines start in five seconds...

481
01:08:49,572 --> 01:08:50,698
Four...

482
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,002
Three...

483
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,133
Two...

484
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:54,507
One...

485
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:17,262
Close in! No more drills.

486
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:21,726
No more practice.

487
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:25,300
You are all about to receive the honor

488
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:30,438
of going into combat
for the first time as Ultramarines.

489
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,417
- Brother Verenor.
- Brother Proteus.

490
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,582
You shall make your battle pledges
upon this sacred warhammer.

491
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:47,619
This hallowed weapon has fought
in the hands of our greatest veterans.

492
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:52,566
It has slain alien beasts and daemons alike.

493
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:57,505
One day
you may be worthy enough to wield it.

494
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:01,408
Until then you may kneel before it.

495
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:07,707
We march for Macragge!

496
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:10,845
And we shall know no fear!
