00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,012
          And may they          
          keep their beds warm  

119
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,114
        for General Cromwell's  
        gallant men.            

120
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:18,649
       (SOLDIERS LAUGHING)      

121
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,621
    Come on, boy. Nearly home.  

122
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,307
                   Well!        

123
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,593
     Master Marshall, welcome.  

124
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,128
 I trust you're well, sir.      

125
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,665
 My body is as strong as ever,  

126
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,467
        but the war continues?  

127
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,703
 Aye, we still fight.           
                And why...      

128
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,004
 Well,                          
 my company's recruiting.       

129
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,605
 I have two days' leave.        

130
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,908
         Then you must eat      
         with us this evening.  
 I thank you, sir.              

131
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,462
       We still have good food  
       for all you soldiers     
       take it from us.         

132
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,281
    And ale. Come,              
    we shall drink together.    

133
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,142
       After your experience,   

134
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,011
         it is likely           
         our village has grown  

135
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:11,812
         a little smaller       
         for you, eh, Richard?  

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,065
 Not so much smaller            
 as lacking in promise,         
 perhaps.                       

137
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:21,038
      In Ipswich or Cambridge,  
      a man might find          
      better opportunities.     

138
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:24,074
   Richard,                     
   if you took Sara to wife...  

139
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,226
  You mean,                     
  you'd give us your blessing?  

140
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:27,995
          You would take her    
          away from here?       

141
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,297
 You honor me, sir,             

142
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,282
 but I only have a small farm   
 that belonged to my father     

143
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,549
 and my soldier's pay,          
 which is...                    

144
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:36,670
     I am little concerned      
     with your ill kept lands.  

145
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:40,541
  And still less                
  for the silver you get        
  for killing good Christians.  

146
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:46,730
      Well, forgive me.         
      That was unjust.          

147
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,500
   But there is trouble         
   coming to this village       

148
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,236
    and I want Sara far away    
    before it arrives.          

149
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:56,140
 Surely Suffolk should be free  
 from the King's armies.        

150
00:12:56,207 --> 00:13:00,010
 It's not only                  
 the King's armies              
 which bring death this year.   

151
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,514
 A lack of order in the land    
 encourages strange ideas.      

152
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,649
      You mean more rebellion?  

153
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:08,051
  I'm sorry,                    
  you have worries              
  enough already.               

154
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,589
 But give me your word          
 that you will soon take Sara   
 away from here                 

155
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,991
     and you shall ask          
     her consent tonight.       

156
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,177
              You have my word  
              on that, sir.     

157
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,112
   Good, Richard. Good.         

158
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,568
     That's right, my dear.     

159
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,320
      Master Richard Marshall.  

160
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:28,172
        Farm boy into soldier.  

161
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,791
        Welcome back,           
        Master Marshall.        

162
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,344
      I'm glad to be back,      
      Mistress Sara.            

163
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,781
 By the way, Sara,              
 I expect the meal              
 at the usual time.             

164
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,483
       (CHUCKLING) Yes, Uncle.  

165
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,687
   Your uncle                   
   has agreed to our marriage.  

166
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:47,791
             Richard.           

167
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,527
          (RICHARD LAUGHING)    

168
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:59,303
 Oh, the army has taught you    
 rough manners.                 

169
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,617
   Sara, why is he frightened?  

170
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:17,721
 There have been threats to us  
 since you were last here.      

171
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,122
               Threats? Why?    

172
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,457
 We've been called              
 papists and idolaters,         

173
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,959
 and filth                      
 chalked up on the walls.       

174
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,562
 They say                       
 we're King's creatures         

175
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,129
 and should be                  
 pilloried and worse.           

176
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,298
        Who says these things?  

177
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:30,133
 We've become outcasts          
 in our own village.            

178
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:35,306
                    Rest easy.  

179
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,042
   Now, no one shall harm you.  

180
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,645
        I put my oath to that.  

181
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,087
     Have you arranged a day    
     for the wedding, Richard?  

182
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,288
  No, sir.                      

183
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,657
 Much depends                   
 on how the armies move.        

184
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,626
    Remember, it must be soon.  

185
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,729
 But how certain                
 are your fears                 
 of this danger?                

186
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:02,866
       Perhaps just             
       an old man's bad dream,  

187
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:05,919
       and being an old man,    
       I must early to my bed.  

188
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:06,987
         Good night, my dear.   

189
00:15:07,055 --> 00:15:08,622
       Good night, Uncle.       

190
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,193
 Oh, and Sara, remember to see  
 the doors are well bolted.     

191
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,594
                   Yes, Uncle.  

192
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,398
      And Richard,              
      don't keep Mistress Sara  
      up too late.              

193
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,866
        Country women           
        need full eight hours   
        in their beds           

194
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,703
     if they're to be           
     proper wives and mothers.  

195
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,038
       Goodnight, Cornet.       

196
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:26,407
 Goodnight, sir.                

197
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,285
   And will you                 
   make a proper wife           
   and mother, Sara?            

198
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,721
       I still have             
       much to learn, Richard.  

199
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,623
    I'll teach you.             

200
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,427
 Now,                           
 didn't your uncle just say     
 you must early to bed?         

201
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:47,495
                   He did.      

202
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:50,297
 And isn't he a wise man?       
                   He is.       

203
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:51,465
           Right.               

204
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,882
    How much further, Matthew?  

205
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,017
 You will not call me Matthew.  

206
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,220
 I'm not one of                 
 your drinking cronies,         

207
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,322
 carousing                      
 and wenching in the taverns.   

208
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,523
    Aye, you're not that, sir.  

209
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,409
       Remember, John Stearne,  
       you ride with me         

210
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,210
     only because               
     you help me in my work.    

211
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:11,895
     Oh, you call it work?      

212
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,581
     It's the Lord's work,      
     a noble thing...           

213
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,015
         And a profitable one.  

214
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:17,601
        The Good Lord           
        paying in silver        
        for every hanging.      

215
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,703
  That is blasphemy, Stearne.   
  Hold your tongue.             

216
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,706
    I'm merely an honest man    
    who helps you get           
    your confessions.           

217
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,792
    The law                     
    has prescribed due methods  
    of interrogation.           

218
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,028
       And I have been          
       blessed with the skills  
       to carry them out.       

219
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:31,064
     Oh, stop your gabbling.    
     We have work to do         
     in Brandeston.             

220
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,315
      Who is it this time?      

221
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,852
      The message               
      tells of a priest.        
             A priest?          

222
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,005
      One who gives             
      worship to Satan          
      and calls him Lord.       

223
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,674
       Oh, with the priest      
       himself a witch,         

224
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,327
 there'll be others             
 corrupted, too, I'm thinking.  

225
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,729
      You enjoy torture,        
      don't you, Stearne?       

226
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:49,116
            And you, sir?       

227
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,321
        Goodbye, sir.

            with you, Richard.  

229
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,943
          Goodbye, Richard.     
         Goodbye, Sara.         

230
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,479
     I'll see you again soon.

232
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:48,625
 Given up ale for star-gazing,  
 Tom Salter?                    

233
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:51,929

 Matthew Hopkins, a lawyer.     

236
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:59,336
     Must be important,         
     that you wait after dark.

      Aye.

  from the village back there,  
  waiting for you.

254

 And made unholy signs.         
     Yeah, he did. I saw him.

               Yeah.            

597
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:45,777
 You better get out of here.    
        Yeah, I'm going,

602
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,691
      For God's sake, Stearne,  
      what have you done?       
      Who was that?             

603
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,460
 Richard Marshall.              
                     Who?       

604
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:17,829
 He's married to the girl,      
 Sara.                          

605
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,263
          How did he find you?  

606
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:20,632
 He was looking for you.        

607
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:21,900
 He found out                   
 about Brandeston.              

608
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:23,134

   have to separate.            

609

 in Lavenham.                   

611
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,506
 Not me. He's after our blood.  

612
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:31,175
  Seems to me he's already had  
  some of yours.                

613
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:33,144
 Well, he's not                 
 going to have any more,        
 you understand?                

614

 You're forgetting our powers.  

615
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,780
          He could be a witch.  

616
00:55:35,848 --> 00:55:38,149
  He's a man who's out          
  to kill both of us.           

617
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:43,020
    Then it appears to me       
    that we should take steps   
    to see to his death first.  

618
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,222
  Come. We travel to Lavenham.  

619
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,938
        I full well understand  
        your feelings, Cornet,  

620
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,474
       but you're

       a soldier,               

621

       is punishable by death.  

622
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,128
        However, in this case,  
        there are two factors   

623
00:56:24,196 --> 00:56:28,432
      which will stay me        
      from subjecting you       
      to a full court-martial.  

624

       for a major assault      
       on the Royalist armies.  

626
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:36,774
 We need every man we can get.  

627
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:39,878
        And you're              
        a pretty good soldier,  
        most of the time.       

628
00:56:39,946 --> 00:56:41,963

   send to the gallows

631
00:56:47,936 --> 00:56:50,788
   But, Cornet, remember this.  

632
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:54,492
           If you should leave  
           your command again,  

633
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,130
 I will have no alternative     
 but to throw the whole weight  
 of military law against you.   

634
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:00,398
                   Understand?  

635
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:01,433
       Yes, sir.                

636
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:03,985
            Dismissed, Cornet.  

637

                         Aye.   

640
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:35,183
             What happened      
             with the Captain?  

641
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,535
                  Nothing.      

642
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,304
 I heard about Brandeston,      
 Richard.                       

643
00:57:40,372 --> 00:57:42,089
   Hopkins and Stearne.         

644
00:57:42,157 --> 00:57:43,925
     I'll find them somewhere.  

645
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:45,393
 But what can you do?           

646
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:47,729
    What proof have you         
    that they                   
    committed any crime?        

647
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,364
   I've got Sara's word on it.  

648
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,115
    Is that enough              
    for the magistrates?        

649
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:52,917
         There'll be no         
         magistrates involved.  

650
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:54,619
      What do you mean?         

651
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:01,308
   We'll talk more later,       
   Richard.                     

652
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,844

 Yeah, but if they find out     
 who we are, they'll...         

661
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,143
          They won't. Come on.

  but you are selling, friend.  

668
00:59:02,354 --> 00:59:04,205

        that one, there, too.

672
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,247
     You can't go saying        
     things like that, friend.  

673
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:16,217
 What he needs                  
 is a little army discipline.

  in your platoon, Sergeant.

01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,451
                 And what age?  

713
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:46,787
 Well, two are young, sir,      
 Elizabeth Clark                
 and Mary Reynolds.             

714
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:48,722
 The other's worn and old.      

715
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,991
          Fetch the young pair  
          here to me.           

716
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:52,159
   What of the other hag?       

717
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:54,661
            Well, the old ones  
            are more sensible.  

718
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:56,830
           It's the young ones  
           who are stubborn.    

719
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:58,132
            They require time.  

720
01:03:58,199 --> 01:03:59,566
       Oh, I see.               

721
01:04:02,003 --> 01:04:03,320
   Sir?                         
                    Yes, man?   

722
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:04,621
 Your assistant, sir.           

723
01:04:04,689 --> 01:04:07,391
  We were told he, too,         
  would be coming to Lavenham.  

724
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:09,025
       He's engaged elsewhere.  

725
01:04:09,093 --> 01:04:11,161
  He's fighting                 
  for the Parliamentary cause.  

726
01:04:11,229 --> 01:04:14,297
 Oh. He will be                 
 joining you here, sir?         

727
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:15,599
           I really can't say.  

728
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:16,933
 You can manage without him?    

729
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:18,202
                  Of course.    

730
01:04:18,269 --> 01:04:20,621
 I apologize...                 
                    No.         

731
01:04:20,688 --> 01:04:22,222
           Not only can I       
           manage without him,  

732
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:25,225
    but I intend to instigate   
    a new method of execution,  

733
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:30,831
         and you, Master Webb,  
         you shall aid me       
         in carrying it out.    

734
01:04:30,898 --> 01:04:32,132
 What's that, sir?              

735
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:34,400
                   You'll see.  

736
01:04:34,468 --> 01:04:38,805
      It's a fitting end        
      for the foul ungodliness  
      in womankind.             

737
01:04:38,873 --> 01:04:40,841
    Yes, sir.                   

738
01:04:40,908 --> 01:04:42,643
   Now,                         
   fetch that young pair here.  

739
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,844
    Sir.                        

740
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,010
 An excellent meal, gentlemen.  

741
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:05,699
          There is little       
          I find so satisfying  

742
01:05:05,767 --> 01:05:08,134
  as good food                  
  after a well-earned victory.  

743
01:05:08,202 --> 01:05:10,070
           Wouldn't you agree?  
            Entirely, General.  

744
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:13,356
The conflict at Naseby,         
sir, will go down               
as a triumph of your strategy.  

745
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:14,691
                Perhaps.        

746
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:16,459
             I would rather     
             that it went down  

747
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:18,579
            as a triumph        
            for the forces      
            of true godliness.  

748
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:21,781
      Nevertheless,             
      your name will symbolize  
      the victory, sir.         

749
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:23,867
          Whether I like it     
          or not, eh, Captain?  

750
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:37,381
      That cornet you so        
      highly recommended        
      to me, is he to join us?  

751
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:38,782
             He's coming now,   
             General Cromwell.  

752
01:05:38,849 --> 01:05:40,149
                       Good.    

753
01:05:40,217 --> 01:05:43,987
        Amongst the most        
        pleasurable aspects     
        of victory, gentlemen,  

754
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:47,156
 is the opportunity it affords  
 to reward valor.               

755
01:05:47,224 --> 01:05:49,476
               It ranks almost  
               with good food.  

756
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:51,878
 Cornet Marshall, sir.          

757
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:54,614
               Mmm. All right.  
               Rest, Cornet.    

758
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,606
     Your captain               
     has told me about you.     

759
01:06:02,673 --> 01:06:04,240
     He says you're             
     a good soldier.            

760
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:06,476
 Thank you, sir.                

761
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:09,012
      He recommends             
      that I promote you        
      to captain.               

762
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:10,597
 I thank you, sir.              

763
01:06:10,664 --> 01:06:14,234
     I have a special           
     mission for you, Captain.  

764
01:06:14,301 --> 01:06:17,403
      Take three men            
      and ride back             
      into East Anglia.         

765
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,005
    The King has escaped us     

766
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,941
    and is rumoredto be making  
    for the Norfolk coast.      

767
01:06:22,009 --> 01:06:24,411
        If that is the case,    
        find and apprehend him  

768
01:06:24,479 --> 01:06:26,529
       before he can escape     
       to the continent.        

769
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:27,630
 It's an honor, sir.            

770
01:06:27,698 --> 01:06:30,267
 Pick your men. Start at once.  

771
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:34,587
     If you find the King,      
     you will escort him then   
     to Norwich.                

772
01:06:34,655 --> 01:06:36,790
  If not, join us in the west.  

773
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:39,042
       Good luck, Captain.      

774
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:51,771
 Shall we rest up               
 for the night, Richard?        

775
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,574
        We've got a job to do.  
        We'll go on             
        till we've done it.     

776
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:56,743
 Do you mean                    
 looking for the King?          

777
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:59,245
 Or finding                     
 Hopkins and Stearne?           

778
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:01,081
             Both.              

779
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:03,450
 Richard, you can't go off      
 and desert again.              

780
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:05,218
    I don't plan to desert!     

781
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:08,088
 But supposing you do find out  
 where they are?                

782
01:07:08,155 --> 01:07:09,756
      Then I shall take         
      temporary leave again.    

783
01:07:09,824 --> 01:07:12,375
    For God's sake, Richard,    
    I know how you feel,        

784
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:16,413
 but to risk court-martial      
 to kill                        
 Parliament's own appointees,   

785
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,914
 you'll be hanged yourself.     

786
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:22,218
   Robert! I've taken an oath.  
   I won't break it!            

787
01:07:22,286 --> 01:07:23,503
      It's madness!             

788
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:24,671
         It's justice!          

789
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:27,707
      It's my justice.          

790
01:07:32,046 --> 01:07:33,680
  HORSE SELLER: And what about  
  one of them, sir?             

791
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:35,982
      You won't find            
      better horseflesh         
      in the whole of Suffolk.  

792
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:39,936
 So, how much you going to try  
 to drag out of me              
 if I take that one?            

793
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:41,604
 He's yours                     
 for a couple of guineas, sir.  

794
01:07:41,672 --> 01:07:42,806
    A guinea.                   

795
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:44,274
           A guinea and a half  

796
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:45,541
  for getting me                
  out of bed                    
  at this hour of the morning.  

797
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:46,709
  One guinea.                   

798
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:47,844
              And a quarter?    

799
01:07:47,912 --> 01:07:49,312
  I'll quarter you.             

800
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,914
          You drive             
          a hard bargain, sir.  

801
01:07:50,982 --> 01:07:52,149
     Yeah.                      

802
01:07:52,216 --> 01:07:53,650
              And where would   
              you be heading    

803
01:07:53,717 --> 01:07:55,118
         that you need a horse  
         in such a hurry?       

804
01:07:55,186 --> 01:07:57,687
 To find my partner.            
             Your partner, eh?  

805
01:07:57,755 --> 01:08:00,023
     And what line of business  
     might you be in?           

806
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:02,092
    God's business,             
    witch-finding.              

807
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,227
              Witch-finding.    
              Oh, that's nice.  

808
01:08:04,295 --> 01:08:05,728
             That's very nice.  

809
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:09,465
 You wouldn't make it a guinea  
 and a quarter, would you?      

810
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:12,302
       Do you know a man        
       called Matthew Hopkins?  

811
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:14,304
 You know where he is?          

812
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:16,873
     I heard tell               
     of such a man down south.  

813
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:18,175
          Lavenham, I believe.  

814
01:08:18,242 --> 01:08:20,110
  What's he doing in Lavenham?  

815
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:22,578
       Extracting confessions,  
       I don't doubt.           

816
01:08:22,646 --> 01:08:25,615
 You let me have                
 that four-legged cripple now!  

817
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,652
 This happened three days ago.  
 Why didn't you report it       
 to the militia then?           

818
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,787
      How should we know        
      it was the King himself?  

819
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:49,489
 A stranger,                    
 obviously a townsman,          

820
01:08:49,557 --> 01:08:51,458
 tries to hire a boat           
 to cross to France             

821
01:08:51,525 --> 01:08:52,726
 and you suspect nothing?       

822
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,477
       When the country's       
       torn by civil war?       

823
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:55,879
            I didn't know       
            there was a war on  

824
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:57,563
         till you               
         gentlemen told me so.  

825
01:08:57,631 --> 01:08:59,266
 Oh, come on, Richard.          
 We'd better go back.           

826
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:02,185
 Aye, I suppose so.             
 I want to pass through         
 Lavenham and see how Sara is.  

827
01:09:02,253 --> 01:09:04,721
              Lavenham?         
 Aye, how far is it from here?  

828
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:06,272
          About two days ride,  
          I reckon.             

829
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,941
         They got more          
         excitement over there

           than any of your     
           city folk's wars.    

831
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:12,562
     What do you mean?          
        They're burning         
        witches there, I hear.  

832
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,830
          Some such rigmarole.  

833
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,482
      They're in Lavenham!

840
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:09,819
                  Aye.          

841
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,271

 then.

        Lower away.             

851

 there are two more             
 to be burned.                  

854
01:12:51,765 --> 01:12:55,618
      Yes, Magistrate.          
      Master Webb, the others!  

855
01:13:25,983 --> 01:13:27,767
     Here you are,              
     12 guineas in silver.      

856
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:30,403
    To be spent in the service  
    of our Lord, Magistrate.    

857
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,872
    We must thank you           
    for your good work,         
    Master Witchfinder.         

858
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,474
        Thank you, Magistrate,  
        for your aid.

860
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:47,053
           Greetings, Stearne.  

861
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,421
 Is that all                    
 you've got to say              

862
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:49,923
 after leaving me there         
 with Cromwell's men?           

863
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:52,425
      Well, I provided us both  
      with the opportunity      
      to escape.                

864
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:54,277
 Only you did                   
 and I was captured.            

865
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:57,414
     Fortunes of war, Stearne.  

866
01:13:57,481 --> 01:14:01,701
You know me well enough         
to know that I wouldn't         
hesitate to fire and kill you.  

867
01:14:01,768 --> 01:14:03,469
 Aye, you would that.           

868
01:14:03,537 --> 01:14:08,040
 I hold all human life dearly,  
 Stearne, especially my own.    

869
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,442
 Oh, come now.                  

870
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,511
 You've escaped                 
 and all is well.               

871
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:13,146
                      Maybe.    

872
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:15,414
     I even saved               
     your share of the pay      

873
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,617
    even though I did           
    all of the work myself.     

874
01:14:17,684 --> 01:14:20,854
 Now,                           
 are you going to be sensible   
 or do I kill you?              

875
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,107
 By the way, do you know        
 what they call me now?         

876
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:26,476
                         What?  

877
01:14:26,544 --> 01:14:28,478
      Witchfinder General.      

878
01:14:28,546 --> 01:14:29,912
 There are those who think      

879
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:32,315
      that I should be          
      appointed such            
      for all of England,       

880
01:14:32,383 --> 01:14:34,350
  appointed by Parliament.      

881
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:36,919
                   Here! Look.  

882
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:40,206
 Sara. She's here.              

883
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:41,491
       Very nice, eh, Matthew?  

884
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:42,575
    No, you fool.               

885
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:44,610
 Don't you realize              
 that if she's here,            

886
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:46,612
 that trooper                   
 must be around, too?           

887
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,148
       But he's away fighting.  

888
01:14:48,215 --> 01:14:50,716
    Suppose he got leave        
    after Naseby.               

889
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:52,852
  Where do you think he'd go?   
  To see her, of course.        

890
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,387
          We better move along  
          then, eh?             
               No.              

891
01:14:54,454 --> 01:14:56,989
    That man, Marshall,         
    is not going to give up.    

892
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:59,091
         He's proved            
         that to us already.    

893
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:00,710
     Then we have to get him    
     before he gets us, right?  

894
01:15:00,777 --> 01:15:03,396
        We have the power       
        to do it, legally.      

895
01:15:03,464 --> 01:15:04,630
       Prove him a witch, huh?  

896
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:06,182
            Exactly.            

897
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,434
          He'd never confess,   
          not that one.         

898
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:09,786
      On his own, no.           

899
01:15:09,854 --> 01:15:12,421
       But if we had            
       him and the girl?        

900
01:15:12,423 --> 01:15:15,107
   Yeah,                        
   she's the niece of a man     
   we executed for witchcraft.  

901
01:15:15,175 --> 01:15:17,043
  And Marshall is her husband.  

902
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:18,878
  I owe that jumped-up plowboy  
  a seeing-to.                  

903
01:15:18,945 --> 01:15:20,546
 Go out and ask around.         

904
01:15:20,614 --> 01:15:22,782
  Find out if he's been seen.   

905
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:26,987
 If not,                        
 we'll tarry here a while       
 until he does arrive.

 It's me.

909
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:04,707
 They were here,                
 Hopkins and Stearne.           

910
01:16:04,775 --> 01:16:06,042
 I didn't know what to do.      
 I saw them in the street.      

911
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,243
 I didn't know                  
 if they saw me or not.         
            I know.             

912
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:08,678
            I know.             

913
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:17,386
   Well, I'll be in the tavern  
   with the others, then.       

914
01:16:35,205 --> 01:16:36,956
 He's here, Matthew!            
 Just arrived.                  

915
01:16:37,024 --> 01:16:38,524
           Where's he gone?     
  To see the girl.              

916
01:16:38,592 --> 01:16:40,609
               Alone?           
 Yeah. The three others         
 are in the tavern.             

917
01:16:40,677 --> 01:16:42,778
         Go and get us          
         an extra man to help.  

918

      going to take them,

         arrived two days ago.  

926

 Yes, and then                  
 he was with the other one      
 in the street today.           

927
01:17:25,906 --> 01:17:27,239
    And they haven't left yet?  

928
01:17:27,307 --> 01:17:30,009
I'm not sure.

 and you, Richard Marshall,

             It is that, sir.   

935
01:18:02,209 --> 01:18:04,244
         Will you describe      
         your evidence to us?   

936
01:18:04,278 --> 01:18:06,795
          I observed            
          the accused talking   
          with their familiars  

937
01:18:06,863 --> 01:18:08,514
      and making                
      the signs of Satan, sir.

 to which you refer?

 An accused witch.              

947
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:40,914
 They must be                   
 submitted to the test.         

948

   going to do with him?        

953
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:04,269
 Leave him. I'll inform         
 the magistrate later.

   To the castle to test them.  

962

       Test them?               

963

               They're accused
