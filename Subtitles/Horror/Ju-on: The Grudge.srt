1
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:17,559
Ju-on: The curse of one who dies
in the grip of powerful rage.

2
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:22,314
It gathers and takes effect in
the places that person was alive.

3
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:27,069
Those who encounter it die,
and a new curse is born.

4
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:14,616
The Grudge

5
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:21,665
Rika

6
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,628
Social Welfare Center

7
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,399
I'm back.

8
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,525
Hello.

9
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,572
Write your name and the time
in here, please.

10
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,032
All right.

11
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,415
There.

12
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,750
Thanks.

13
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,463
Rika!

14
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,382
It's this.

15
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,385
What? By myself?

16
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,888
There's no one else around.

17
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,515
But...

18
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,896
Whose case is it?

19
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,358
I can't reach him.

20
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,237
He took the key and left,
and hasn't come back.

21
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,574
I'm just a volunteer...

22
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,869
That's all right.
You're used to this.

23
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:41,912
Mr Hirohashi...

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,540
Mr Goto's looking for you.

25
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,166
Goto?

26
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,797
Would you do it?

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,173
Just look in on her.

28
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,550
But...

29
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,969
I'll buy you dinner.

30
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,888
You don't have to...

31
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,608
Tokunaga

32
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,635
Hello?

33
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,567
Hello!

34
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,378
I'm from the Welfare Center...

35
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,724
May I come in?

36
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,881
Are you all right?!

37
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,804
You're Sachie, right?

38
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:34,686
I'm here to help out
in place of Mr Takahashi.

39
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,397
I'm Nishina Rika.

40
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,351
Come on...

41
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,686
Come here...

42
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,278
Sachie!

43
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,032
Who's that boy upstairs?!

44
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,952
Sachie!

45
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,097
He was shut in a closet!

46
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,142
You didn't say anything
about a child.

47
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,981
Yes. He's still upstairs.

48
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,066
Yes.

49
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,028
I told you, they aren't home yet!

50
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,073
Yes.

51
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,367
But...

52
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,412
Yes.

53
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,206
All right.

54
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,667
Yes.

55
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,770
There's no one home right now.
Please leave a message.

56
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,525
Hello? It's Hitomi.

57
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,155
Hello? Kazumi, are you there?

58
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,659
How's Mom getting along?

59
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm a bit worried,
so please give me a call.

60
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,174
Um, what's your name?

61
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,762
Toshio.

62
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,766
Yeah? 'Toshio'...

63
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,353
My name's...

64
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,689
I told her.

65
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,623
Sachie?

66
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,251
I told her.

67
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,254
I told Kazumi.

68
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:02,718
I told her again and again.

69
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,763
I told her again and again.

70
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,141
What's the matter?

71
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,188
Why don't you lie down, OK?

72
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,358
Again and again, I told her.

73
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,863
Just the way you said to.

74
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,159
Please stop tormenting me.

75
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,708
Sachie...

76
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:15,624
Katsuya

77
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,019
Morning.

78
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,528
Mom sure sleeps late these days.

79
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,698
That's 'cause she's up all night.

80
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,950
Every night.

81
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:36,497
I'm sure it's fine for someone
who can sleep through anything.

82
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,464
Maybe it was the move.

83
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,723
I'll talk to the helper.
We're paying for him, after all.

84
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:59,228
That won't help. Your mother's
always nice with other people.

85
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,397
OK, OK. Try to get along, will you?

86
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,401
You'll be home early?

87
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,655
Your sister's coming!

88
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,535
You forgot!

89
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,162
Is it Friday already?

90
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,456
Get it together.

91
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,417
Hurry home.

92
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,586
OK. See you.

93
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:04,293
Oh, Mother!

94
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,463
Just tell me if you want something!

95
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,907
Who's that?

96
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,576
Who's there?

97
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,044
I'm home!

98
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,633
Is Hitomi here?

99
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,097
Kazumi?

100
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,524
Mom?

101
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,785
Where's Kazumi?

102
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,124
Mom?

103
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,569
Where is she?!

104
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,613
Kazumi!

105
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,033
Kazumi?

106
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,288
Are you here?

107
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,050
Kazumi?

108
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:41,593
Kazumi!

109
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,012
Hey! Kazumi!

110
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,349
Kazumi!

111
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,351
Kazumi!

112
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,019
Hey! Kazumi!

113
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,861
What's wrong? What happened?

114
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,782
What?

115
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:10,706
Hang on. I'll call an ambulance.

116
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:51,723
What are you doing here?!

117
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,539
Kazumi!

118
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,868
Hello!

119
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:06,006
Hello? I'm here!

120
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:08,425
Kazumi?

121
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:10,802
Kazumi?

122
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:32,366
Hi, Mom. How are you?

123
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,840
Where's Kazumi?

124
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,892
I'll start getting dinner ready.

125
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,977
Kazumi? Is that you?

126
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,190
Katsuya?

127
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:08,045
Don't scare me like that!

128
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,382
Where's Kazumi?

129
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:19,223
Kazumi went out. Something came up.

130
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:26,230
She's not shopping?
She'll be back soon, won't she?

131
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:38,075
I'm sorry, Hitomi.
This isn't a very good time.

132
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,202
What's going on?

133
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,914
Did something happen?

134
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,624
She had another man.

135
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,708
What?!

136
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,504
She deceived me!

137
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:55,259
That's not my child.
That's not my child.

138
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,761
What are you talking about?!

139
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,560
Look, just go away, OK?

140
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,439
Are you feeling all right?

141
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:13,610
I'm fine.
Just leave me alone for a while.

142
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:22,471
Hitomi

143
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:32,105
There's no one home right now.
Please leave a message.

144
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,610
Hello? It's Hitomi.

145
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,865
Hello? Kazumi, are you there?

146
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,787
How's Mom getting along?

147
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:53,502
I'm a bit worried,
so please give me a call.

148
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,902
Tokunaga Katsuya

149
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:05,407
Hello, Katsuya?
I just called your house.

150
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,953
Hello? Katsuya?

151
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,543
Look, this isn't funny!

152
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,761
Sorry. I just hung up.

153
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,229
Who's there?

154
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,005
The 5th-floor Ladies'?

155
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,257
Yes.

156
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:07,469
I'll go take a look.

157
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,972
You wait here.

158
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,431
Excuse me!

159
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,070
Yes?

160
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:13,822
Hello? It's me.

161
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,032
Katsuya?

162
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:19,411
I'm out front of your building.
What number were you?

163
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:23,540
702! Hurry, will you?

164
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:41,975
Katsuya!

165
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,253
...also a house bat,
a pygmy woodpecker...

166
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:57,593
...wild birds not seen here before,
a blue-green snake...

167
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:03,557
...among 54 discoveries, including
a 2.5- Meter discarded snakeskin...

168
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:20,676
Toyama

169
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,206
Hello?

170
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,171
Hello?

171
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,925
Missus?

172
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,220
Missus?

173
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,911
Rika?

174
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,080
Rika?

175
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,255
Rika!

176
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,758
Rika!

177
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,781
Mr Nakagawa...

178
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,118
Dial him.

179
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:13,515
Up there.

180
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,378
Rika...

181
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,591
Rika!

182
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,845
Are you OK?

183
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,850
Yeah. Sorry, Mariko.

184
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:59,561
You're missing school.

185
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:03,607
That's OK.
I've got all the credits I need.

186
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,821
Anyway, what happened?

187
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,910
I don't really understand
that myself.

188
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:20,916
Was Hirohashi bugging you
to do something again?

189
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,126
And you couldn't say no?

190
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,215
You're supposed to be
the care-giver!

191
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,844
I'm glad you came.

192
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,596
I'll go buy a drink.

193
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:50,320
So that was the first time
you'd been there?

194
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,865
Yes, it was.

195
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:58,912
About the child
you say you saw there...

196
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:03,292
Did you find him?

197
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,171
No... not yet.

198
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,928
'Toshio'...

199
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:20,642
He said his name was Toshio.

200
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,060
Toshio?

201
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:33,947
Ms Nishina, the Tokunagas
don't have any children.

202
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:35,407
What?

203
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:41,079
What about that photograph?

204
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,916
There was a family picture
in the house.

205
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:50,297
That wasn't the Tokunagas.

206
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:53,300
Then who was it?

207
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,095
We're looking into that.

208
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,518
Detective...

209
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:07,606
What happened there?

210
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,409
Excuse me.

211
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:38,011
The families before the Tokunagas
all died or disappeared, too.

212
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:41,431
Is this all of them?

213
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:48,438
What about the sister?

214
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:51,024
We can't find her.

215
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:55,404
A security guard
where she works is dead, too.

216
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,574
And...

217
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,410
...look at this.

218
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:11,086
A man named Saeki Takeo
killed his wife Kayako there.

219
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:16,592
Later he was found dead
on the road by a neighbor.

220
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:24,349
Saeki Kayako, 28, housewife.

221
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:30,355
She and Takeo had a son.

222
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,450
'Toshio'...

223
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:55,297
Kayako's body was found...

224
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:01,803
...up there under the roof.

225
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:30,374
Hi, Daddy!

226
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,000
Hi, Izumi. Where's Mom?

227
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:33,335
Shopping.

228
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,712
She'll be angry again
if you don't get home.

229
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,840
It's OK. Come over here.

230
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,132
Why?

231
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,676
Come on!

232
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:42,511
Quick!

233
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:44,137
What is it?

234
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:46,974
Look at this.

235
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,351
Did you draw those?

236
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:50,602
Yep!

237
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:54,690
This is the Prince of Heaven.

238
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,651
That's the Princess.

239
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:02,239
And that's their baby.

240
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:04,741
Yeah? And who's this?

241
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,251
Mr Toyama Yuji? Lgarashi,
Yahara Division.

242
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:17,671
Ow!

243
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:22,676
What is it?

244
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:28,265
You were in charge of the
Saeki investigation.

245
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,893
I'd like to talk to you.

246
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,232
Izumi, you get on home.

247
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:54,291
I quit the force.
Leave me alone, will you?

248
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:58,253
Two more people have died there.

249
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,430
You're the only one left
who was involved with the case.

250
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,773
Izumi! What are you doing there?

251
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:22,861
Did you clean the bath?
It's your turn today, you know.

252
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,405
Get going.

253
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:34,748
Was this the boy you saw
at the Tokunaga house?

254
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,293
Yes.

255
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,297
Take a good look.

256
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:47,344
You're sure?

257
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:51,640
Yes, it was him. Did you find him?

258
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,850
No.

259
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:59,273
He went missing five years ago.
He's never been found.

260
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:06,613
Even if he were alive somewhere,
he'd be 11 years old.

261
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:25,883
Huh?

262
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,926
Mr Nakagawa...

263
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,887
This is Toyama Yuji.

264
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,890
He was on that case.

265
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,017
Thank you.

266
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:24,441
My name's Nakagawa. Come in.

267
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:43,418
Tokunaga Hitomi. Her elder brother
Katsuya lived in that house.

268
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,588
She went home, then disappeared.

269
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:50,008
Someone in her building
saw her come home.

270
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:01,562
They found Hirohashi's body.

271
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:06,567
The man who found Rika is dead.

272
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,693
Mr. Toyama.

273
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:10,154
Would you excuse me a minute,
please?

274
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:47,120
Lzumi, you're chicken!

275
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:48,455
What's that?

276
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,624
Sake.

277
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,043
What's that doing here?

278
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:58,674
Saori, you pig!

279
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:02,594
That's not sake.

280
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,183
I'm leaving!

281
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,644
Wait! It's OK!

282
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:11,854
Are you running out?

283
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:12,980
Lzumi!

284
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,749
What a suck!

285
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:38,005
She's always like that.

286
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:45,345
Yeah, and I heard...

287
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:47,723
...now she hangs with Chiharu.

288
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:00,110
He hasn't come home.
Where could he be?

289
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:05,741
Well? She's gone, you know.

290
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,743
Can you believe that!

291
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:10,245
Ayano, check out the window.

292
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:14,041
She's there.

293
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:18,337
She's by the gate.
It looks like she's thinking.

294
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,589
Why's she so scared?

295
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:23,217
Maybe she's got ESP.

296
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:26,261
She didn't have to leave!

297
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,722
I'm cold.

298
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:30,807
Yeah.

299
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:33,101
What was that?

300
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:34,061
What's wrong?

301
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:36,063
Lzumi's gone!

302
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,691
What?

303
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:18,188
Mr Toyama!

304
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,983
Mr Nakagawa!

305
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:22,818
Mr Toyama!

306
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:24,903
Please!

307
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:26,822
Get a grip!

308
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:28,991
What happened?!

309
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:03,192
Lzumi

310
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,402
What's 1 st period?

311
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:06,862
English?

312
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:08,780
Mr Sekine!

313
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,199
Oh, yuck!

314
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,075
His English is weird!

315
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,118
Yeah!

316
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:15,871
It doesn't sound like
any English I've heard.

317
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:18,332
Do foreigners understand him?

318
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:20,834
He probably can't speak it!

319
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,881
Yeah, but he's teaching it to us!

320
00:58:28,926 --> 00:58:30,010
Lzumi?

321
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,262
Lzumi?

322
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:36,391
What's wrong?

323
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,559
Nothing.

324
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:42,231
Missing

325
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:50,823
Isn't she Izumi?

326
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:52,866
She is not.

327
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:55,911
Find one?

328
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:57,120
Not yet.

329
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:17,057
'Bye.

330
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:20,310
Mr Sekine!

331
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,062
What's up?

332
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,358
Toyama? What's wrong?

333
00:59:28,152 --> 00:59:31,446
There's no picture of Izumi.

334
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,073
Why not?

335
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:36,243
That shouldn't be. Did you look?

336
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:37,369
There isn't.

337
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:39,788
We looked and looked and looked!

338
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:40,914
I see.

339
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:45,085
OK, I'll check the negatives.
Can you wait a while?

340
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:47,296
'Bye.

341
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,298
How long?!

342
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:52,426
Don't pull!
You'll stretch my sweater!

343
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,052
Within a week.

344
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:55,971
Why a week?!

345
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:57,514
I'm a busy man!

346
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:34,218
A woman's body has been found
in an empty house in Nerima ward.

347
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:39,139
Nishina Rika,
a 23 year-old social worker...

348
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:43,936
...had been listed as missing.
No marks were found on the body.

349
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:54,214
Thank you.

350
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,553
Finally!

351
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,555
It's not my fault!

352
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:04,349
We're going to Izumi's.

353
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:07,311
OK, I'll come with you.

354
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:08,228
Hey!

355
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:09,688
No, thanks. 'Bye.

356
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:11,982
We'll bring them back tomorrow.

357
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:14,109
Talk to Toyama for me!

358
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:16,111
Let me see!

359
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:17,237
No!

360
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:19,072
We'll see them with Izumi.

361
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:21,492
But I want to see them!

362
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,677
You're Izumi's friends?

363
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:50,604
Lzumi? It's Chiharu and Miyuki.

364
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,191
We brought the pictures.

365
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:08,080
Can we come in?

366
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:32,563
Isn't it a bit dark in here?

367
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:36,900
Don't!

368
01:03:58,297 --> 01:03:59,590
Lzumi?

369
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:02,301
What's wrong?

370
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:05,762
Lzumi?

371
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:13,437
The three of them are looking in...

372
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,483
...at me.

373
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:24,364
'The three of them'?

374
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:29,161
Saori and the rest.

375
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:36,502
The night they disappeared,
I was with them.

376
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:40,756
Then why didn't...

377
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,174
I was scared!

378
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:48,472
Scared of what?

379
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:56,605
When we came back
from the school trip...

380
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,442
...Saori said...

381
01:05:03,821 --> 01:05:07,366
...there was a haunted house
near here.

382
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:09,368
Haunted?

383
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,790
Where?

384
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:17,709
I forget!

385
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:19,962
How could you forget?

386
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:21,338
I wanted to!

387
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:25,342
Lzumi,
will you tell us what's going on?

388
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:33,642
Even before we went in...

389
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:38,981
...I felt something strange.

390
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:48,824
Izumi, do you have ESP or something?

391
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,159
I don't.

392
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:52,369
It's not that.

393
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:54,830
You guys keep away.

394
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:04,965
Saori and the others treated it as
a joke, but I couldn't stay there.

395
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:09,553
I left, by myself.

396
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:15,934
I was scared. I ran away.

397
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:20,355
They're coming for me!

398
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:24,401
Lzumi, chill out!

399
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,907
Close the curtains!

400
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:31,450
Close them!

401
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:33,535
Close them!

402
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:51,595
That's what my husband was like
before he died.

403
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:57,351
He had all the windows
closed tight...

404
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:03,023
Does Izumi know about that?

405
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:10,864
I never told her anything about it.

406
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:31,468
The pictures...

407
01:07:49,027 --> 01:07:51,363
What's that?

408
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:17,431
Chiharu!

409
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,139
Who are you?

410
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:08,690
Dad?

411
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:32,714
I saw you at that house, you know.

412
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:18,005
Kayako

413
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:26,305
Hello?

414
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:30,058
Mariko! It's been ages!

415
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,729
Yeah. What's up?

416
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:36,231
Yeah.

417
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:40,944
Wow, that must have been hard.

418
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,906
Peek-a-boo!

419
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:49,661
Peek-a-boo!

420
01:12:57,085 --> 01:13:00,714
Tomorrow? Yeah, I'm OK.

421
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:03,300
Yeah, OK.

422
01:13:04,218 --> 01:13:06,720
OK, see you.

423
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:14,728
I'm coming, Mr Saito.

424
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:21,068
I hear you're going to be
a great-grandfather!

425
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:24,321
Peek-a-boo!

426
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:31,119
Mr Saito?

427
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:41,380
Thank you.

428
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,804
Rika!

429
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:33,849
Mariko!

430
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:37,311
How have you been?
You've changed your hair.

431
01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:38,770
I got it cut.

432
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:42,274
Are you free Sunday?

433
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:44,443
Sunday? Sure.

434
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:45,360
Yeah?

435
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:48,906
He gave me two tickets...

436
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:50,908
...and said to take you.

437
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:52,242
Really?

438
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:56,580
What?

439
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:01,710
In third year you liked Toyoshima,
didn't you.

440
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:03,003
Huh?

441
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:07,216
It was all over your face.

442
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,194
There's already one problem kid...

443
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:29,571
in my new class.

444
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:32,241
He hasn't come to school once!

445
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:33,992
And his parents?

446
01:15:34,076 --> 01:15:37,329
That's the problem.
I can't contact them.

447
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:41,250
Well,
there must be some kind of reason...

448
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:44,294
At least they could return my calls.

449
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,547
I want to finish my home visits!

450
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:49,591
Oh, yeah... home visits...

451
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:53,720
All the other teachers
have finished theirs.

452
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:54,555
That's funny.

453
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:55,472
What is?

454
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:59,518
You're turned into a real teacher.

455
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,937
What about you?

456
01:16:03,897 --> 01:16:08,068
I wonder about that.
I don't really understand...

457
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:10,404
What?

458
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:13,532
I thought I felt...

459
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:18,370
Rika? Are you OK

460
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:22,332
Rika!

461
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:26,920
Rika, what's wrong?! Are you OK?

462
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:29,047
Uh, yeah...

463
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:44,933
Hello, Nishima.

464
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:46,477
Rika?

465
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,564
Mariko? I'm sorry about today.

466
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:55,319
You scared me! Are you all right now?

467
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:59,114
Yeah. Thanks for asking.

468
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:02,743
I'm sorry I ruined your day off.

469
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,370
No, I'm OK.

470
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:08,081
Where are you now?

471
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:11,084
Remember that kid I told you about?

472
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:14,129
I'm at his house now.

473
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:15,631
Yeah...

474
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:19,802
There's no one here but the boy.
His parents haven't come home.

475
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:22,805
I've been here for an hour.

476
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:32,815
Mariko, where exactly are you?

477
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:43,200
Hello?

478
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,285
Hello, Rika?

479
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,125
Hello?

480
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:56,171
Hey. Rika!

481
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,348
Toshio?

482
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:09,309
Toshio?

483
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:12,855
Toshio?

484
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:18,777
Toshio?

485
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:26,118
Are you up here?

486
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,765
Mariko!

487
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,922
Mariko...

488
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,876
Mariko?

489
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,960
Mariko?

490
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:03,817
No!

491
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:09,823
No!

492
01:24:11,426 --> 01:24:12,886
No!

493
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:12,793
No!
