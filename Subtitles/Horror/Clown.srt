1
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, you guys, you can't
play in there, Jack.

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
It's dangerous, there's nails and stuff.

3
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,600
Should've dumped them all
of at Chuck E. Cheese

4
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,130
Well, that place is a nightmare.

5
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
I hate clowns.

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,500
Yeah, well, it's what he wanted.
He's seven.

7
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,070
Well, when I was seven,
I thought clowns were creepy.

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,860
Oh, you can tell that to the
clown when he gets here.

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,260
Okay, you need a drink.

10
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,280
No, I can't.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,650
Why not?

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,490
Meg?

13
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,000
You're not?

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,340
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,520
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,600
You can't say anything to Kent, okay?
It's a total surprise.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,700
Huh?

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,600
What surprise?

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,110
Hey, Dad.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,900
He is... he is coming isn't he?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,100
Yes, he's just running a little late.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Just checking.

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,900
Uh, Denise, pour me a
beer there will ya?

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,440
Hello?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,940
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,570
Is there somebody else
you could sent?

27
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,190
Yes, Sir.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Oh no, it's no problem at all.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,300
Oh, it's my pleasure.

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,390
Okay, bye.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,340
Okay. I'm coming, I'm coming.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,100
Hey, honey.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,710
I'm headed out the door.

34
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,000
Is Jack excited?

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

36
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,770
The Party Emporium
people screwed up, and...

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,100
there's no clown coming.

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
<i>I thought you had a backup.</i>

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Who double-books a clown?

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,660
Listen, just...just hurry up
and get home, okay babe?

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,900
<i>Kent?</i>

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,880
Okay, listen, it's... everything is
gonna be fine. I'll be home soon.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,960
Hello?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
Hey everybody.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,100
Where's daddy?

46
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,770
He's gonna miss the clown.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,570
Listen...

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,250
It seems like there was a little
bit of a goof-up, all right?

49
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,829
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?</i>

50
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,859
He's here!

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,200
<i>Gather around, one and all,
for the wacky...</i>

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,960
<i>The Wonderful, Dummo,
the clown.</i>

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,450
Let's get this party started, huh?

54
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,100
Where is the number one
birthday boy, huh?

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,700
We give it up for Jack.

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,630
Let's make this
the best birthday ever.

57
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,590
Okay, Jack.

58
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,810
I've gotta go back to the circus,
time for bed.

59
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,260
I know it's you dad.

60
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,010
No, my name is Dummo.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,660
I hear your dad is a
pretty great guy though.

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,470
Go, go, go, go!

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh, God.

64
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,410
I forgot I was a clown.

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,620
You were perfect.

66
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,860
Jack loved it.

67
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,340
Where did you find that thing?

68
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,770
Where's the zipper.

69
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,550
It slipped right on.

70
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,450
I have big news for you.

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,460
Oh yeah.
Didn't know it was my birthday.

72
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,120
What?

73
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,290
This might be just all to weird

74
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,360
Come on!

75
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,730
Make a little...
make a little clown baby.

76
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,400
- Huh?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,020
You can go watch TV.
I'm gonna go take a shower first.

78
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,510
You take that thing off,
I'll give you your present.

79
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,610
Kent.

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,300
There better not be clown
marks on the couch, sweety

81
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,440
Yes, still a clown.

82
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
What time is it?

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,980
I think this wig is stuck.

84
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,710
Yeah, you shouldn't have slept in it maybe

85
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,300
Hey guess what.

86
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,630
The clown is driving
you to school today.

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,200
- Cool!
- Yeah, cool!

88
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,670
- No, wait, honey, I have a crew...
- You gotta hurry 'cause Jack's late for school.

89
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,390
- I have a crew waiting for me.
I have to get changed.

90
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,180
Love you.
Love you.

91
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Hurry up and eat, come on.

92
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,680
- Dad, hurry, I'm gonna be late.
- Coming.

93
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

94
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,000
Jack, your lunch.

95
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,320
Jack, your lunch.

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,240
Thanks, Dummo.

97
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,090
Hey guys, sorry I'm late.

98
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,600
It's uh... It's just tearing the
carpet out on the first floor.

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,400
They won't talk about the hard wood.

100
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,360
Who are you?

101
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,380
I'm Kent, the realtor.

102
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,330
I talked... to Miguel. I'm sorry,
are you Miguel?

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,850
Why are you dressed like a clown?

104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
You guys have kids?

105
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,040
Aah! Fuck!

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,660
<i>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!</i>

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Stupid fucking clown.

108
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,500
Can I use this?

109
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,010
What are you doing in there?

110
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,490
You need some help?

111
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,620
No, no, no, no, no. I got it.

112
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,010
It's a... it's looking great by the way.

113
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,680
This is a bad idea.

114
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,350
Oh, Dad.

115
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,560
What are you doing?

116
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,920
I wanted to surprise to
Jack with a swing set.

117
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,530
You scared the crap out of me.

118
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,230
Well, I wanted to surprise you too.

119
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,230
Dad, Kent was gonna do this.

120
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,980
Yeah, well. Uh...

121
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,990
I'm just trying to help.

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,950
Yeah, right. It's freezing.
Let's go inside, I'm making dinner.

123
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,450
<i>Damn instructions are in Chinese.</i>

124
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,920
Hey babe, you just missed Dad.

125
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,770
I thought we were having
family dinner, but...

126
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,510
Jack, just went down. So if wanna go
upstairs you can probably say goodnight.

127
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,150
Shadow, lie down.

128
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,870
You went to work like that?

129
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,850
You don't understand.
I, uh..., I can't get if off.

130
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,960
Why not?

131
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,849
Because I can't.
I've-I broke a handsaw

132
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,950
I cut my wrist open.

133
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:16,241
And-and I really...
really, really have to pee.

134
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,760
Okay, okay, okay babe.
Kent, just calm down.

135
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,190
Sweetheart, I physically can not get if off.
I've been trying all day.

136
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,590
Okay, so... so it's-it's stuck.

137
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,900
It's suffocating me.
I-I'm serious. This is...

138
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,700
- All right.
- Ow! Ow!

139
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,890
It's not. It doesn't,
it's not gonna come off.

140
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,070
Why-Why are you laughing at me?

141
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
So dumb! Now I know why
they call you Dummo.

142
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,040
All right.
Here we go.

143
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,460
Relax, okay?
This is what I do.

144
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,083
And if you're really good
I'll get you a lollipop.

145
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,224
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,000
- 1....
- Ow, Ow.

147
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,000
- 2...
- Ow!

148
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
O-okay, okay. Okay.

149
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,500
All right.

150
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,760
Alright, I'm just gonna do this.

151
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,220
Are you serious?

152
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,250
Like a bandage, okay?

153
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
1....

154
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
2...

155
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,540
3!

156
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,170
Shadow, bad dog!

157
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,790
Sweety, what did you do to yourself?

158
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,880
Did you dye your hair?

159
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,690
It's a wig.

160
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,210
No, it's not.

161
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,800
Did you dye and perm your hair?

162
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,060
- I didn't dye my hair. What the...
- Daddy.

163
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh, Jack, sweety.
Let's get you to bed, all right, honey?

164
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,470
- C'mon
- What's Shadow eating?

165
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,720
Daddy's okay.

166
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,800
You're just gonna have to
let the adhesive dissolve.

167
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,037
You definitely don't wanna
take any more skin off.

168
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,546
Just take some warm showers.

169
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,450
There wasn't any adhesive,
I'm not an idiot.

170
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,820
Maybe someone is playing a prank on you.

171
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,960
Who would do that?

172
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,010
What happened to your wrist?

173
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,050
Oh, I, uh...
I cut myself.

174
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,470
By accident.

175
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,410
Mr. McCoy, If you need to speak with someone,
we have counselors that can help you.

176
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,040
Funny, uh, no.

177
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,500
You don't understand!
There is something going on.

178
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,000
This-this was a wig
and the white makeup, uh...

179
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
It...

180
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,910
What kind of makeup
do you usually use?

181
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,980
I'm not a clown!

182
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,600
Come on Jack, brush your teeth.

183
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey Olive, it's Kent.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,430
Can you do me a favor?

185
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,180
Can you check the property files

186
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,000
to see if the Odell place lists
of the previous owner's name?

187
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,430
I think the initials are KC.

188
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,450
O-o-okay, ho... let me uh... give me a second
let me see if I can find...

189
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,510
You know what? I'll...
I'll come in and get it.

190
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
- Hey Olive.
- Hey Kent.

191
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,640
- Sorry.
- Ugh.

192
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,480
Son of a bitch.

193
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,870
Still hungry?

194
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,410
Ugh, gross.

195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,990
I don't know, it looks old.
It smells weird.

196
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,180
Come on, anything else, please?

197
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,530
I don't know, man. We sell Halloween
costumes and cheap stuff, not like that.

198
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,650
Okay, but who does?

199
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,550
There's like a lot, they're in here.

200
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,150
That one.

201
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,820
Yes?

202
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,880
<i>Uh</i>, I'm calling about uh... a clown costume,
I-I think might belong to you.

203
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,610
It was found in
Martin Karlsson's basement.

204
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,140
Where is Martin?

205
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,120
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Uh...

206
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,250
Martin Karlsson passed away.

207
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,110
I'm the real estate
agent handling the...

208
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,346
<i>Listen to me, whatever you do...</i>

209
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:44,004
<i> don't touch that costume.
You understand?</i>

210
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,910
<i>Stay away from it!</i>

211
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,400
<i>Are you still at the house?
I'll be over... as soon as I can.</i>

212
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,160
<i>But don't touch the costume, please!</i>

213
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,620
I'm wearing it.

214
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Hello?

215
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,840
That's uh... That's fine. Uh...
Be careful! It's old, and fragile.

216
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,316
Uh... it doesn't seem very fragile.
I-I'm actually

217
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,489
having a pretty hard
time getting it off.

218
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,120
Ah, don't worry.
That happens all the time.

219
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,050
<i>The heat from your body can constrict
the moisture trapped in those old fibers,</i>

220
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,130
<i>makes it, uh... hard to get off.</i>

221
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,390
Oh, that-that makes perfect sense.
I thought... I thought I was going crazy.

222
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,580
But we should meet as soon as possible,
can you come to my warehouse?

223
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,420
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I-I can get there.

224
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,900
<i>We'll have that thing off in no-time.</i>

225
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Hello?

226
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,220
Hello?

227
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,670
Is anyone here?

228
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,100
- Kent.
- Jesus Christ!

229
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,470
I didn't wanna scare you.

230
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,610
Uh, I'm Bert Karlsson.

231
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Tea?

232
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:15,384
Uh...

233
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,650
Hm... Thank you.

234
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,870
I have been abroad, off and on...

235
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,540
these last couple of years.
I haven't talked to Martin for ages.

236
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,260
Our relationship was...

237
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,830
yeah, complicated.

238
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,290
I'm sorry. I've never met him.

239
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,450
That is a very old, traditional costume
from the Nordic regions.

240
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,540
It was until years later,
it became a... silly character.

241
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,090
The original... clown,
he was not funny at all.

242
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,947
So... tell me, Mr. Karlsson.

243
00:21:57,972 --> 00:22:01,204
How are we going to get
this thing off of me?

244
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:08,310
Very few people know the true origin
of what we call <i>"the clown."</i>

245
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,280
I can show you here.

246
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,930
There.

247
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,800
<i>It lived up in the mountains,</i>

248
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,300
<i>with a skin white as snow and
the red nose blistered by the cold.</i>

249
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,440
<i>It lured children out of the
villages into it's cave.</i>

250
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,101
<i>Five children...</i>

251
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:39,324
<i>one child for every month...</i>

252
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,258
<i>of winter.</i>

253
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,880
<i>Over the centuries, the legend of
the Clöyne was forgotten.</i>

254
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,990
<i>He became "the Clown."</i>

255
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,980
<i>His white face and red nose
to make people laugh,</i>

256
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,350
<i>to entertain children,</i>

257
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,730
<i>if only they knew.</i>

258
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,360
Why are you showing me this?

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,100
So you can understand.

260
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,500
Oh, shit.

261
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,570
No-no, the tea was supposed
to keep you asleep for hours.

262
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,430
I'd go get some more but I
can't risk you getting loose.

263
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,710
What? What?

264
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,180
It's gonna be all right.

265
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,500
Decapitation is the only way
to stop the demon.

266
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Who are you?

267
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,790
Wait, wait, wait!

268
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,300
No.

269
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,400
I'm sorry.

270
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,050
- I'm so sorry.

271
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,770
What the fuck?

272
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,270
I'm sorry. I just need...

273
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,840
What the fuck are you doing?

274
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:18,010
It's not a costume,
it's skin and hair of a demon.

275
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,920
- Honey, call 911.
- Sweety. What?!

276
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,400
Wait, where have you been?

277
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,020
This-this manic tried to kill me.

278
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,800
The guys who's house it was
that had the suit in it.

279
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,100
Look, he thinks I'm a demon.

280
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,902
Honey, we have to go to the cops.

281
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:44,621
But you have to come
with me 'cause they're

282
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,034
gonna think I'm crazy if
I'm dressed like a...

283
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,800
clown.

284
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,660
What's the fuck?

285
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,600
Are you wearing makeup?

286
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,090
Let go of her, Kent.
What the hell is wrong with you?

287
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,860
Walt, I know this seems a little crazy,
a little nuts. But this guy's a maniac.

288
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,500
If this is a joke,
it's not very funny.

289
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,820
It's not a joke.

290
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,880
So what the problem?
Just take off the clown suit, man.

291
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,700
I can't! You think
I'm making this up?

292
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,270
He chopped my neck
with a butcher knife.

293
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,890
Wait, is this blood?

294
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,750
Yes, it's my blood. He chopped
me with a butcher knife.

295
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,210
Who did?

296
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,040
Who the hell is that?

297
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,630
He tried to cut off my head.

298
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,360
He thinks I-I'm turning
into a demon.

299
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,430
Baby, he's crazy. Th-This is his suit.
He did this, all of it.

300
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,150
Just take the fucking thing off.

301
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,230
Oh, Jesus, Dave.

302
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,260
You broke his fucking arm!

303
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,970
Meet me at the police station.

304
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,800
Please.

305
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,190
You're going to jail, man.

306
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,960
You are going to jail!

307
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,600
I'm trying to help you.

308
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,580
It's... happening!

309
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,000
What are you doing to me?

310
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,300
Kill... yourself.

311
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,500
Before... ugh...

312
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,080
Hey man, you're okay?
You're okay, man?

313
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,000
<i>Kill yourself...</i>

314
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,400
Kill yourself...

315
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,370
Ms. McCoy?

316
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,030
I'm sorry, what?

317
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,030
Alright, one last question uhm...

318
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,810
Do you remember what he was wearing
the last time you saw him?

319
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,892
Like a...

320
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,321
a long coat and a...

321
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:06,518
dark hat.

322
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,900
Okay.

323
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,620
If you hear something, call.

324
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,730
Thank you.

325
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,560
<i>Maybe it's a chemical thing.</i>

326
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,500
You know, he seems like...
Mr. Perfect Dad.

327
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,460
But then, suddenly...

328
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,870
Look, I want you and Jack to come
stay with me for a while.

329
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,590
You gotta think of your family, Meg.
You can't baby him.

330
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,260
You gotta tell Jack
his dad's dangerous.

331
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,400
No.

332
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,450
Alright, I don't have to
listen to this anymore.

333
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,470
- I'm just trying to make it clear that...
- Dad?!

334
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,300
He was scared.

335
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,780
<i>Mom, is this my fault?</i>

336
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,660
No, it's not your fault.
It's no one's fault.

337
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,750
Let's get some sleep.

338
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,870
Good night, doll.

339
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,320
<i>Lights out, fellas, let's go.</i>

340
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,550
Hey, you left your dirty
plate by the fire. Go clean up.

341
00:32:15,574 --> 00:32:16,574
Ah, alright. Yeah.

342
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,820
Don't get lost <i>lard-ass.</i>

343
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,000
Zip-it, Dickenson!

344
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,890
Do you have any food?

345
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,320
All I want is some food.

346
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,090
I've got these...

347
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:43,864
<i>...who should pick him up,
are me or my emergencies.</i>

348
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,525
So you got my cellphone. And
my dad's first name's Walt, so...

349
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,300
try him too.

350
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:51,901
Thanks. I appreciate it.

351
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,720
Oh hey sweety, come here.

352
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,320
I'm gonna go, okay?

353
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,910
But who's gonna pick you up today?

354
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,830
- You or Denise.
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,580
And if you see Daddy?

356
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,410
Is Daddy bad?

357
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
No.

358
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,700
No, no, no, no.
No.

359
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,590
He just, he... has to do some
grown up stuff today.

360
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,990
Okay, but if he comes to pick you up?

361
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:21,000
Say that the teacher wants to talk to him
and that he should call Mommy.

362
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,900
- And... and that's it.
- Mm-Hmm.

363
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,300
Daddy gonna be home soon, okay?

364
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,000
Bye, doll.

365
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,290
Bye, doll.

366
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,200
<i>Hey honey, it's me.</i>

367
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,550
<i>It's your dad. I'm uh... just wanna
make sure if everything is okay.</i>

368
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,500
<i>If you hear anything,
please give me a call.</i>

369
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,830
<i>Give me a call, okay?</i>

370
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:09,300
<i>Alright people. Ten
minutes, we're leaving.</i>

371
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,170
<i>Gotta go pee.</i>

372
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,990
<i>Ah, it stinks in here.</i>

373
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,100
<i>Oh, gross. What is that?</i>

374
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,600
Hello!

375
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,790
Is there anybody in there?

376
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,500
The door is locked.

377
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Hello?

378
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,240
Just... stay away from me!

379
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
Are you a clown?

380
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,800
My name is Robbie,
What's your name?

381
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,830
Wow! You're really hungry.

382
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,618
If you wanna eat...

383
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:02,950
<i>I got some cookie crisps and...
waffles...</i>

384
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,250
<i>and... cinnamon toast crunch,
and... chocolate chip</i>

385
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,600
<i>and... chips, and some gumby's
and some beef jerky...</i>

386
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:17,374
<i>and some cookies, and grilled cheese
and fries with ketchup... and...</i>

387
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,860
Stay away.

388
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,590
Hi, want some cereal?

389
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,500
<i>Mr. Clown?</i>

390
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,160
<i>Mr. Clown?</i>

391
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,800
<i>Mr. Clown?!</i>

392
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,790
<i>He's acting crazy.</i>

393
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,590
I don't know, maybe
it's something he ate?

394
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,400
It's because he ate
Daddy's clown nose?

395
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,300
Oh, Jack stay right here.
Stay here.

396
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,900
Is that Daddy?

397
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,280
Hello, Kent?!
What's going on?

398
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,990
<i>Jack really misses you.</i>

399
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,760
I'm so sorry.

400
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,242
Tell me where you are, t-tell me you're okay.

401
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,254
 I can't take this.

402
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,610
I'm sorry.
This-this is the only way.

403
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,300
Hello?

404
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,550
Mom?

405
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,370
When is Daddy coming home?

406
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,917
Tonight, Jack. Don't worry.

407
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,624
Daddy is gonna be okay.

408
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,650
Ah, thank you.

409
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,400
It's gonna take you all night.

410
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,200
Are you sure?

411
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,220
Yeah, we'll find him.

412
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,250
Yeah, our last big fight,
I was bawling my eyes out.

413
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,100
Kent was hanging out at
one of his properties.

414
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,811
Heh, what an asshole.

415
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Yeah.

416
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,530
You're building a fun house?

417
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,800
Kent?

418
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Kent?

419
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,500
Kent, you're here?

420
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,900
Mr. Clown!

421
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,900
No!

422
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,720
Oh, no!

423
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,500
Kent.

424
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,800
<i>No!</i>

425
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,440
<i>Don't open the door.</i>

426
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,630
Kent, it's okay.

427
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,200
<i>No!</i>

428
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,590
<i>You don't.
You don't understand.</i>

429
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,310
I just wanna get you home, Kent.

430
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,410
Look...

431
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,380
I know something crazy
is happening to you, okay?

432
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,870
I believe you.

433
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:06,184
Okay?! I believe you.

434
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,300
<i>We're gonna figure
this out together.</i>

435
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,950
Jack needs you.

436
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,900
I need you.

437
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,495
Kent....

438
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:29,370
I'm pregnant.

439
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,360
Take me home, please.

440
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,710
I can feel myself changing.

441
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,780
What do you want me to do?

442
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:57,410
No matter what I say,
you don't let me out.

443
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,960
Promise me.

444
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,180
Promise me.

445
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,290
I promise.

446
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,470
Until we can get you fixed.

447
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:13,920
Okay?!

448
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,570
<i>Dr. Martin Karlsson</i>

449
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,680
<i>Children's cancer ward.</i>

450
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,680
Karlsson

451
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,460
Do you know who I am?

452
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,090
I just wanna talk to you.

453
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,235
I don't know what happened
between you and my husband,

454
00:50:12,236 --> 00:50:14,050
but I just want him back.

455
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,710
<i>"Where is he?"</i>

456
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:40,190
I don't know. He, uh...
The police are looking for him.

457
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,930
<i>"Only I can help"</i>

458
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,690
Because this suit.. It does
things to people doesn't it?

459
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,610
<i>"Don't trust him"</i>

460
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,930
How do you get the suit off?

461
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,840
How do you get the suit off?!

462
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,380
How did you get it off?

463
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,250
Who are you?

464
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,270
If you don't want to help me out,
I'll find another way.

465
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,580
<i>- Mam, you can't be in there.
- I'm leaving.</i>

466
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,400
Hello?

467
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,500
Hello?

468
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,600
<i>Aww, what's wrong doll?
Are you crying?</i>

469
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,760
Shut up!

470
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,660
<i>You're such a little bitch.</i>

471
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,900
<i>What's wrong?</i>

472
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,180
<i>Don't you wanna look like a clown?</i>

473
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,670
Just like your fag dad.

474
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,230
Fuck, he bit me!

475
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,000
<i>Mom?</i>

476
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,560
<i>Mom?</i>

477
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,780
<i>Jack?</i>

478
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,360
Hello?

479
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,750
<i>I'm in the basement, buddy.</i>

480
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,840
Daddy, is that you?

481
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,500
<i>Sure is sport, didn't
you miss Daddy?</i>

482
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,690
Mommy said if I saw you,
I had to tell the teacher.

483
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,350
<i>Is she here?</i>

484
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,190
I don't think so.

485
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,940
<i>Good, come downstairs.
I need help.</i>

486
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,920
<i>Mommy said it's okay.</i>

487
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,980
What are you doing down there, Daddy?

488
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:08,320
<i>Come downstairs. I want to see
my number one birthday boy. </i>

489
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,470
Hello?

490
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,900
<i>- Meg?</i>
- Yeah.

491
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,270
<i>I was picking Jack up
at school today right?</i>

492
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,790
Yeah, Denise, thanks for that.

493
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,130
<i>No, I mean I'm at the school,
and-and he is not here.</i>

494
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,260
Daddy?

495
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,850
I'm stuck Jack.

496
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,560
I need help.

497
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,750
Were you crying buddy?

498
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,460
Hey.

499
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,480
Come on now.

500
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,050
You know you can
always talk to Dummo.

501
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,100
At school...

502
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,880
some kids tried
to put paste on my face.

503
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,470
They're always doing that stuff.

504
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,850
Who is?

505
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:05,660
Colton.

506
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:10,930
You know what I did when I was bullied?

507
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:17,100
I hid, so that they
couldn't find me.

508
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,530
And then after a while,

509
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,990
you know what happened?

510
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,230
They left you alone?

511
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,670
Hey Jack, you know where
the bolt cutters are?

512
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,200
Kent?!

513
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,100
Jack?!

514
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,900
Why'd you leave school?

515
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,430
Don't ever do that to me, okay?

516
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,410
Jack.

517
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,070
Where's Daddy?

518
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,600
Where is he?

519
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,720
<i>Shit dude, don't kill me!</i>

520
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,900
- Guys, you guys really...
<i>- I'm not camping.</i>

521
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,350
I just want to tell you something.

522
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,500
You guys suck balls.

523
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,500
<i>Yeah, your mom's balls.</i>

524
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,200
<i>Come on, man.</i>

525
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
<i>- Duh, look at me. I'm Colton.
- Have you seen me?</i>

526
00:59:52,029 --> 00:59:53,229
<i>Wait, I don't know where it is.</i>

527
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,670
Who gives a shit where
the rocket launcher is?

528
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,500
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

529
00:59:58,586 --> 00:59:59,886
Ha-Ha! Bitch!

530
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,600
<i>Who's gonna need that
rocket launcher bullshit?!</i>

531
01:00:02,672 --> 01:00:04,124
<i>Yeah, rocket launchers are cheap dude!</i>

532
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:06,148
<i>Rocket launchers are for bitches, man!</i>

533
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,100
Shit, guys, don't kill me.

534
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,400
<i>I stopped listening after
that bullshit you just pulled.</i>

535
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,500
<i>C'mon Colton, how long does
it take to change a tampon?</i>

536
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,100
Guys, I think there's
someone in here.

537
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,900
<i>Probably Master Chief.</i>

538
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,540
<i>Check this out.</i>

539
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:45,882
<I>Oh man, that reminds me of what I
did to Colton's mom last night.</I>

540
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,170
Mr. McCoy?
<i>- Yo Colton?!</i>

541
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,630
Is Jack here?
<i>- Colton?! </i>

542
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,190
<i>Where are you?</i>

543
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,290
<i>Maybe he's in trouble?
- Why?</i>

544
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:58,100
<i>We were ditching class and we saw
this kid, Jack, crying on the steps.</i>

545
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,660
<i>- Pussy.
- So Colton made him act like a clown.</i>

546
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:03,110
<i>And he called his dad a fag.</i>

547
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,500
<i>So Colton took this pint of glue.</i>

548
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,900
<i>And was gonna rub it all on
that little douches face.</i>

549
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,850
Guys, shut up!

550
01:01:08,883 --> 01:01:11,531
<i>Then he grabbed Colton's hand and bit him.
- Oh man</i>

551
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,037
<i>Colton's gonna beat his ass.</i>

552
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,400
Guys, shut up!

553
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,040
<i>You're done man.</i>

554
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,440
Grandpa's excited to see you.

555
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,530
You don't want your
little friend anymore?

556
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,370
Jack, say something.

557
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,390
Jack, come on, we gotta go.

558
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,270
Shadow?

559
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,000
Shadow?

560
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,800
Shadow, what happened to you?

561
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,990
Where is he?

562
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,700
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

563
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,650
Get the hell away from us.

564
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,320
I don't want to hurt you.

565
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,840
You stay away from us.

566
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,000
You killed my fucking dog.

567
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,300
Please, you've gotta help
me find your husband!

568
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,765
Get the fuck out of my house!

569
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,355
<i>Get the fuck out of my house!</i>

570
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,810
It's the detective!

571
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:53,370
I'm the only one who can
get that costume off.

572
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:13,780
I found that fucking goddamn
costume by accident.

573
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,720
Hundreds of all costumes
used to come from my shop.

574
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,500
One day, there was a
shipment from Iceland.

575
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,800
With a state stamp or something.

576
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,940
Icelandic Aristocrat

577
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,730
<i>When I opened the crate,
everything was rotted away but...</i>

578
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,740
<i>this costume... It was perfect!</i>

579
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,580
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

580
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,500
<i>I was about to sell it
to Damascus Circus</i>

581
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,640
<i>but I wanted to put it
to some good use first.</i>

582
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,770
<i>My brother was a doctor...</i>

583
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:49,080
<i>working with children
with terminal illnesses.</i>

584
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:52,210
<I>He was always trying
to give them hope, so I thought...</I>

585
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:55,170
<i>why not cheer 'em up.</i>

586
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:03,620
<i>When the transformation started,
I asked my brother for help.</i>

587
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:06,920
<i>He swore he would find a cure.</i>

588
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,580
<i>That's the last thing I remember.</i>

589
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,550
<i>When I woke up, the suit was off.</i>

590
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,300
<i>The curse had been broken.</i>

591
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,720
<i>My brother had given the
demon what it demanded.</i>

592
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:31,210
<i>He had smuggled out from the hospital
5 children close to death...</i>

593
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,601
<i>One child...</i>

594
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:34,065
<i>for every month...</i>

595
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:35,731
<i>of winter.</i>

596
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,740
So that's it?

597
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,700
That's the cure?

598
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:49,080
I've spent all these years trying to
find a clue how to kill this evil thing.

599
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:55,360
My brother, never left the house.
Guarding this costume with his life.

600
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,800
I didn't even know that he
had passed away 'til...

601
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,880
your husband called me.

602
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:07,600
Why didn't you destroy it?

603
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,810
Don't you think we tried?

604
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:12,950
We tried burning it, we tried
to dissolve it in acid...

605
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,150
Everything, nothing helped.

606
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,200
We couldn't just toss it in the
ocean or bury it, could we?

607
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,200
What if someone else found it?

608
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,830
Even the smallest piece
carries the curse.

609
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:33,560
You have to cut off it's head.

610
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:38,500
You can't destroy the costume,
but you can stop the demon.

611
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,970
My husband would never do that.

612
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,300
This here belongs to a
child. 7, 8 years old.

613
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,570
Where did he go, huh?

614
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:58,700
I don't know, I...

615
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,260
You don't know?

616
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,210
He went to Colton's.

617
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,230
Where's Colton?

618
01:06:06,307 --> 01:06:07,307
Jack!

619
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,520
He's gotta be stopped.

620
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,967
Jack...

621
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,800
We have to kill your daddy.

622
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,400
Hey!

623
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,580
Listen to me, alright Jack?

624
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,801
It's not Daddy. It's not.
It's that suit.

625
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:21,719
It's making him do bad things.

626
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,210
But no-one is gonna
hurt Daddy, okay?

627
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,780
You tell us there's another way.

628
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,870
Help me catch him.

629
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,960
We'll lock him up.

630
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,980
Continue searching.

631
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,750
Hey buddy. What...!?

632
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,130
Hey sweety, everything okay?

633
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,719
Yeah, I... Dad, I got to go.

634
01:06:52,744 --> 01:06:54,550
I can't get into it all
right now, I'm sorry.

635
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,860
It's just...

636
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,970
I gotta go, Dad.

637
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,740
Be careful.
He could still be in here.

638
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,600
Hey!

639
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Hey!

640
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,650
Don't touch anything, okay?

641
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,670
We have to call the police.

642
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,000
Tell them what?

643
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:55,070
He must've digested him by now.
Spit out the bones.

644
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,380
He couldn't have gone far.

645
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,750
It's seven o'clock on a Thursday.

646
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:08,110
Where could a clown go?
Where's he not being seen?

647
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,090
Oh, no.

648
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,080
What?

649
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,970
Hey, you can't
go in there like that.

650
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:52,530
Why not?

651
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:55,680
You look like an escaped mental patient.

652
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,800
- Listen, you can't trust your husband.
- Don't.

653
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,700
My brother and I, he should...

654
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,800
You don't know him.
You don't know what Kent can...

655
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,280
I wish he had killed me.

656
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:18,820
- If you love him....
- I know, I'll bring him to you.

657
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:20,600
I promise.

658
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,080
There's no sign of him.

659
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:53,330
<i>Cannonball!</i>

660
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:58,730
Ugh, gross. Somebody peed in here.

661
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,000
Greg?

662
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,000
Greg?

663
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,100
Greg?

664
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,800
Greg?

665
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,900
Greg, Mom says we have to go.

666
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,100
Greg?!

667
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,900
Greg?!

668
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,000
<i>Greg?</i>

669
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,140
<i>Greg, where are you?</i>

670
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,000
<i>Greg?</i>

671
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,420
Greg, where are you?

672
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
<i>Greg?</i>

673
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,000
Greg.

674
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,970
Don't go up there.

675
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,600
Greg?

676
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,030
There you are.

677
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,000
No. No.

678
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,470
<i>Let go of him!</i>

679
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,430
<i>Run, Greg, run!</i>

680
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:33,620
Mom, Mom!

681
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,220
- Mom! A clown! Up there!
- What is it honey? What?

682
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,200
Excuse me, what happened?

683
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,560
There's a maniac dressed as a clown
loose in there, get your kids!

684
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:25,010
Hey, come, come on.

685
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,270
See?

686
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,300
It means he's close.

687
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,890
What's that for?

688
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,270
For protection.

689
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,100
<i>Kent?</i>

690
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,200
Kent?

691
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,630
Where am I?

692
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,440
We're here to help you.

693
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,740
I know you're scared.

694
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,990
We're going to find a
way to stop it, okay?

695
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,430
We just have to get you
out of here first.

696
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:21,670
Karlsson's here, he-he
wants to help you.

697
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,950
Okay, baby?

698
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:30,200
I remember him, he's crazy.

699
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:32,700
He's not.

700
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,350
He's gonna make sure
no-one else get's hurt.

701
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,100
Enough!

702
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,500
Kent, look out!

703
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,780
Kent. No!

704
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,890
Kent, no! He's gonna help you!

705
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:55,493
Kent, I just.. Let me help you!

706
01:16:55,518 --> 01:16:56,684
Please.

707
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,350
I know you're still in there.

708
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,360
Come on, there's gotta be another way.

709
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,320
Bring me a child.

710
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,720
Kent?!

711
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:21,790
Bring me one more child, and you
can have your husband back.

712
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,700
A child!

713
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,990
I can't. I can't.

714
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,000
Perhaps I'll find another?

715
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,367
What's his name?

716
01:17:35,642 --> 01:17:37,274
Ahh yes...

717
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:39,526
Jack!

718
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,930
Find the child and bring him to me.

719
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,237
Bring him to...

720
01:17:51,394 --> 01:17:53,494
to our favorite spot, babe.

721
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,300
I'll be waiting.

722
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,800
Wait.

723
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,630
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

724
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:09,200
<i>All right, we are coming in!</i>

725
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,430
<i>Police, stay down!
Stay on the ground!</i>

726
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,400
<i>Put your weapon down!
Put it down!</i>

727
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,400
<i>Put it down, motherfucker!</i>

728
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,350
Dad, do you got Jack with you?

729
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:00,900
Yeah, yes, of course he's with me.

730
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,540
He's fine. Don't worry about him.

731
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,200
<i>He's being awfully quiet,
I'm thinking of taking him home.</i>

732
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,400
No, you can't go home.

733
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,750
Okay, just take Jack,
just take him and you gotta leave.

734
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,110
<i>Is Kent in there, Meg?</i>

735
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,260
What did Kent do?

736
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,832
No, it's not Kent, Dad.

737
01:19:19,616 --> 01:19:20,854
Kent didn't do anything.

738
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,900
<i>You've gotta at least tell me what's
going on, I'm here to help you.</i>

739
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,480
Dad, I have to...

740
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,240
<i>Meg?</i>

741
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,400
<i>Meg?!</i>

742
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,630
I have to go.

743
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,460
Hunter!

744
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,710
Oh, thank you so much.

745
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,810
Are you looking for your kid?

746
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,750
Uh, no. He's safe.

747
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,050
<i>Police have confirmed that there
have been 2 fatalities so far...</i>

748
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,080
<i>both of them children.</i>

749
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,420
<i>And now we've received confirmation
that the authorities...</i>

750
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,200
<i>do have at least one
suspect in custody.</i>

751
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,730
<i>A 59 years old man
named Herbert Karlsson....</i>

752
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,400
You work at the dentist right?

753
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,920
Yeah.

754
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,600
I mean, I used to go there.

755
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,630
Okay.

756
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,170
I was at Chris's birthday party and
everything went totally crazy.

757
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,300
And I can't find anybody
and my mom dropped me off...

758
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,950
and I don't know where
she is and I saw you....

759
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,790
and I remember that you
used to be really nice...

760
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,650
even though the dentist
was kinda scary.

761
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,200
You used to call him <i>CrumBum</i>
when he left the room.

762
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,200
Uh-huh.

763
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,570
Can you drive me home?
I'm scared.

764
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,240
You want a ride home?

765
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,660
Please, I don't know anyone else.

766
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,090
You're so nice.

767
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,520
Sorry I don't know the way.

768
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,710
Oh, that's alright. I know your street
so we'll find your house. Don't worry.

769
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,970
You're so nice.

770
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,900
You know, I...

771
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:56,350
think if it were my son in trouble I'd
wish someone would help him out so...

772
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,970
Are we here?

773
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:08,640
Yeah, this is it.

774
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,510
Your home.

775
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:21,175
This, isn't...

776
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,590
This isn't my house.

777
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,100
This isn't my house!

778
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,600
Hey, it's scary out here.
Unlock it, please!

779
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,780
Please, unlock it, please!

780
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,730
There's someone out here!

781
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:50,754
Please, please unlock the door!
Please!

782
01:23:52,012 --> 01:23:53,012
Please!

783
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,140
There's someone out here,
please unlock the door!

784
01:23:55,165 --> 01:23:57,304
Please, unlock it!

785
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:00,000
Unlock the door, please!

786
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,700
Unlock it, please!

787
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,890
Get in the car.

788
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:12,280
I'm sorry.

789
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,490
What are you doing?

790
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:14,800
I'm so-sorry

791
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,440
It's not safe out there!

792
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,400
Hey!

793
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,360
Hey, hey, wait here.

794
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,100
Jack!

795
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,947
Dad, call me back! Okay?

796
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:47,364
Where are you and Jack?

797
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:51,770
Home at last.

798
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,080
Okay, let's go and have a
little chat with your Dad.

799
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,960
Stay close to Grandpa.

800
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,380
Dad, I told you not to come back here!
Where's Jack?

801
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,440
He's ok, he's up in his room.

802
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:50,240
Dad, I made-I made a mistake.

803
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,650
Listen, I-I don't know...
what happened.

804
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,054
I don't care what happened.

805
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:56,290
I just don't want you
implicated in this.

806
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:59,610
Whatever Kent did, it's okay.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

807
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:01,190
I'm gonna help you.

808
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,610
What are you talking about?

809
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,267
I'll clean up the blood.

810
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:09,134
No-one will know.

811
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:13,320
Baby, you're my little girl.
I love you. I just...

812
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,870
Run, Jack!

813
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:32,000
Motherfucker!

814
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,240
Mom?

815
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:48,930
Don't watch Jack! Ok?!
We got him!

816
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,500
<i>Meg.</i>

817
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,860
Help me.

818
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:04,830
We got him!

819
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,885
Jack.

820
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:11,164
Jack, g-go get that book.

821
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,790
What?

822
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,830
The book Daddy found.

823
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,330
And go get more chains.

824
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:20,360
Why?

825
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,850
Don't you wanna help Daddy?

826
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:25,450
That's not Daddy.

827
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,370
Jack, I'm sorry.

828
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:59,150
I'm so sorry.
