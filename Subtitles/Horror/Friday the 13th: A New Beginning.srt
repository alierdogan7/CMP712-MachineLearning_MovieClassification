1
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:39,090
Come on, look for it.
I know it`s here.

2
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:43,287
- There!
- Over to the right.

3
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,812
That`s it. There it is!

4
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,246
That`s it. All right!

5
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:56,332
- This is it, all right.
- Let`s rip this sucker open!

6
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,366
Get a look at the main man!

7
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,891
Come on, dig! Deeper!

8
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:17,172
Come on, dig. Come on, let`s dig!
Come on, faster! Dig!

9
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:26,449
Get the dirt off and we`ll open it.
This is it.

10
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,493
Come on!

11
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,608
Come on.

12
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:39,213
- Pry.
- Move it over here.

13
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,763
Harder. Come on.

14
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:52,133
- Come on, Neil!
- OK, here it comes.

15
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,449
No...please, no!

16
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,806
That must be the new kid.

17
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:27,451
Last stop. Everybody out.

18
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:39,453
No? Beautiful. Sit there.
l don`t give a shit.

19
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,006
How you doing?

20
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:46,732
Tommy Jarvis?
Hi, my name is Pam Roberts.

21
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:50,688
l`m the assistant director.
l`m glad you`re here.

22
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:57,813
lf you`d like to grab your things,
l`ll take you in to meet the doctor.

23
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:05,328
Great.

24
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:08,414
Thank you.

25
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,247
Anytime, doll.

26
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,134
How was the ride?

27
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,654
Come on, Tommy.

28
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,247
You OK?

29
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,727
- Come in.
- Hi.

30
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,806
Hi, Tommy. l`m Matthew Letter.
Welcome to Pinehurst. Have a seat.

31
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:49,726
Sit down, son.

32
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:55,334
l`ll tell you
a little about Pinehurst,

33
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,447
then we`ll let you get settled.
How`s that sound?

34
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:05,767
How does that sound?

35
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,208
Sure.

36
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:17,410
All right. About Pinehurst,

37
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:21,846
you`ll find we`re very different
from the state institution.

38
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:26,446
We don`t have any guards here.
Nobody tells you what to do.

39
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:31,125
- Basically, you`re your own boss.
- lt`s an honour system.

40
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,684
What you`re really doing here, Tommy,

41
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:39,331
is preparing yourself to re-enter
society and start a new life.

42
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:45,408
Pam, wanna point Tommy toward
his room and get him started?

43
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:49,846
Sure. OK? Go through the kitchen,
up the stairs,

44
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:54,047
and it`s the first door
on your left, OK? See you in a bit.

45
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:03,688
- What do you think?
- The kid`s a real talker.

46
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,966
l noticed.
How`d they diagnose him?

47
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,131
``Severe trauma at age 12.

48
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:13,054
``Brutal self-defence murder
of a psychopathic killer.``

49
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:17,373
They`ve given him every therapy
and treatment they can think of.

50
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,690
lt`s a wonder his mind
isn`t fried from all the drugs.

51
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:30,366
You scared of spiders?
You scared of rubber spiders?

52
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:37,807
Scared of rubber spiders on strings?
Man, you are one scared cat.

53
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:43,094
Where l come from,
you learn to be scared of nothing.

54
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,287
They call me Reggie the Reckless.
No spider scares me.

55
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,651
Joke, man!

56
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,088
- Don`t.
- Don`t get all twisted out of shape.

57
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:36,326
- You act like you made these things.
- l did.

58
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,208
Solid.

59
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:44,286
So you`re the new nut?

60
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:48,891
- ls that what they call us?
- ``Us``? l ain`t one of you.

61
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:52,052
l`m just visiting.
My granddaddy works here.

62
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:58,452
Gotta split.
Catch you later. There`s action.

63
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:04,647
Joey, come on. Hurry up.
Oh, my God!

64
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:09,254
Hey, you guys! Joey, come on.

65
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,931
Stop, Grandpa! Don`t!

66
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,691
- Hey, Matt. How`s it going?
- All right. What`s up?

67
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,526
lt`s like we talked about.

68
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:34,284
You got some neighbours who
aren`t happy about your place.

69
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:37,691
l respect
what you`re trying to do, Matt, l do.

70
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:42,763
But we found a couple of your kids
on the Hubbard place again.

71
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,410
- Deputy! Bring `em out.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:52,093
Everybody out.
Stop fooling around. Fall in.

73
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:54,933
- Yes, sir.
- Move, wise guy.

74
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:06,245
We found them in Hubbard`s woods
screwing their heads off, Matt.

75
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:10,004
We`re lucky this time,
because Ethel didn`t see them.

76
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,046
l`ll take care of it, Sheriff.

77
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:24,086
- l`ll do the talking. Keep quiet.
- Morning, Ethel.

78
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:26,251
- Don`t you look lovely?
- Horseshit!

79
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:30,971
Sheriff, you better hear me good.
l want this loony bin closed down.

80
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:34,485
You hear? These kids
ain`t nothing but trouble!

81
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:38,005
They disrespect property,
and they`re all crazy!

82
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:41,730
- You tell `em, Ma!
- These kids weren`t doing...

83
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,288
Doing? Doing?!

84
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:47,123
You think l don`t know what those
two perverts were doing in my yard!

85
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:52,090
- Say it like you mean it, Ma!
- Would you shut the fuck up?

86
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,131
l`ll tell all of you.

87
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:03,374
You mark my words,
the next bastard comes near my farm,

88
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,407
l`ll blow your fucking brains out.
You hear?

89
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:09,731
Don`t you come near me, Sheriff,
l`ve warned you.

90
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:12,289
l`ve got a bomb on me.
l swear to you!

91
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:15,566
Make one move toward me,
l`m gonna blow us all up.

92
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:20,450
Start the engines, Junior.
That`s it. My final words.

93
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:26,255
OK, people, let`s go. Party`s over.

94
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,850
She`s really something, ain`t she?

95
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:41,285
Seriously, try to keep
your kids off her property.

96
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,563
l will.

97
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:45,607
l understand
you got the Jarvis kid today.

98
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,328
- He arrived earlier.
- And?

99
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,605
- And what?
- What`s he like?

100
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:54,967
He`s like any other kid.
He`s been through a lot.

101
00:16:55,015 --> 00:17:00,043
- Yeah. Good luck with him, pal.
- Thanks a lot, Sheriff.

102
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,050
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Joey.

103
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:54,369
Hi, Violet.

104
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:00,174
- What are you doing?
- Laundry, Joey.

105
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:05,653
Can l help? l`m very good at laundry.
Matt never assigns it to me.

106
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,372
- Look, we have to get this finished.
- So l`m here to help you.

107
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,804
You can count on me, Rob.
You too, Vi.

108
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:17,564
Want a chocolate bar?
Here, you want it?

109
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:21,369
- l`ll give you half.
- Piss off!

110
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:24,293
Please let me help you.
lt`s no problem...

111
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,052
- Get out of here!
- Fuck!

112
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:30,928
l`m sorry.
l can do laundry great.

113
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:35,366
But if that`s how you feel,
forget it.

114
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:39,852
l`ll just go help somebody else
instead. l`ll see you later.

115
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,888
lf you change your mind,
l`ll be right around...

116
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:49,164
Jesus, what a loser.

117
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:55,327
Look at this sheet.
l`m not gonna wash it, you wash it.

118
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:00,610
- Hi, Vic!
- Get lost.

119
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:04,534
Don`t be like that.
Let me help you with the wood.

120
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:08,726
And anyway,
l got two chocolate bars, see?

121
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:13,451
- Don`t tell the girls.
- What an asshole.

122
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:21,485
You know, Vic, before l came here,
l never had anything to do,

123
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,526
me being an orphan and all.

124
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:28,444
People always teased me about
sitting round like some kind of pig.

125
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:33,728
But here, it`s different. l can
help others and do a lot of things.

126
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:37,165
You know something?
l really love it here.

127
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,452
l hate it!

128
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:44,693
You know, to be honest with you,
l never chopped wood before,

129
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:47,010
but it certainly looks like fun.

130
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,246
Leave me alone!

131
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,286
Here, Vic. Want a bite?

132
00:19:57,335 --> 00:20:01,886
l`ll just put it over here
and you can have it later.

133
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:09,130
Well, if that`s the way you feel,
forget it, Vic! Just forget it!

134
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,292
But l think
you`re really out of line.

135
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:35,533
We got a homicide on our hands.
See what you`ve got on a Faden.

136
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:40,251
Victor J. Faden.
F-A-D-E-N. Thanks.

137
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:58,084
ls there someone we should notify?

138
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,967
As far as l know,
there`s no immediate family.

139
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,404
His mother died while giving birth.

140
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:08,050
l don`t know about the father,
took off somewhere, l guess.

141
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,567
The kid got shuffled from home
to home until he came here.

142
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:18,245
- He was a good kid.
- l know, Matt.

143
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:23,492
So, what have we got here?

144
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:39,686
Bunch of pussies.

145
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,691
Come on, Roy.
Get your hands dirty.

146
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:18,445
Pete, this is bullshit!
This really sucks!

147
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:21,248
Fix it!
Those cunts aren`t gonna wait.

148
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,809
Oh, fuck! This is a mess.

149
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,846
No way, l refuse to do this.

150
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:38,252
You`re always fucking around
with this, so get up and fix it!

151
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:41,045
You understand?

152
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:51,608
- You are an asshole!
- What`s the matter, Vinny?

153
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:55,364
You all creeped-out
by that murder at the nuthouse?

154
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:59,124
As far as l`m concerned,
all those loonies should be

155
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:02,884
killed off one by one.
Can you try it now?

156
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:08,364
Jesus! Can`t you do anything?
Stop screwing around!

157
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:12,806
Get this done by the time l get back.
l gotta take a crap.

158
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:17,774
- Crap, my ass!
- Just do it, man! l mean it.

159
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:22,325
Fucking asshole!

160
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,128
You little fuck.

161
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:20,091
What are you doing, douchebag?

162
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,170
Enough, already. You can stop.

163
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,726
Would you cut it out?

164
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:48,524
All right, either you got the car
started or you`re a dead man.

165
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,487
This ain`t starting, man.
You fucked up again.

166
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:03,652
l`m gonna kick your ass,

167
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:06,607
Come on everybody,

168
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:09,772
Come on, motherfucker,

169
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:13,569
Come on.
You fucked up again, you asshole!

170
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:17,688
What you doing up there, Vinny?
You`re a dirty...

171
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:24,053
All right. And we`re off. Let`s go!

172
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:47,367
Die!

173
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:51,170
- Die!
- Tommy!

174
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:40,012
There you go.

175
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:47,643
- Gramps.
- What is it, son?

176
00:26:47,695 --> 00:26:50,163
Can l go see my brother tomorrow?

177
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:53,605
We`ll see.
You know how l feel about that.

178
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,727
- But Gramps...
- l said we`ll see, Reggie.

179
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,609
Come here, Reggie the Reckless.

180
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:21,414
Do me a favour, don`t kiss me
when there`s people around.

181
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:26,210
OK, it`s cool. Go and let
everyone know breakfast is ready.

182
00:27:29,055 --> 00:27:32,252
Breakfast! Come and get it!

183
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:35,450
l could`ve done that.

184
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:42,251
- l-l m-miss Joey already.
- So do l.

185
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:46,288
l-l hope Victor
gets what`s coming to him.

186
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:49,964
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning.

187
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:54,485
Violet, you set too many places.

188
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,569
l said, you set too many places.

189
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:01,368
- No, l didn`t!
- Yes, you did!

190
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:04,964
Victor and Joey won`t be here
this morning, Violet.

191
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,210
Or any other morning.

192
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:11,134
- Reggie!
- Oh, God. l`m sorry.

193
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:16,805
Y-you don`t s-set a place
for a dead person.

194
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:20,848
- l said l was sorry!
- What`s going on here?

195
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:39,454
Look, l know how you all feel.

196
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:42,771
This thing is not easy...
for any of us.

197
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,404
So let`s just have breakfast.

198
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:51,844
l`m sorry, Violet.

199
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:02,604
- Where`s Eddie?
- He`s upstairs.

200
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:07,414
Would you mind telling Eddie
to come downstairs?

201
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:16,043
Tommy? Would you mind?

202
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:20,969
Yeah, all right.

203
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:40,092
Relax, Chief. What`s wrong,
no sense of humour?

204
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,046
Can`t you take a joke?

205
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:54,814
lt`s all right, Tommy!
lt`s gonna be all right.

206
00:29:54,855 --> 00:29:58,370
Just relax.
You`re gonna be just fine.

207
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:11,125
l`m gonna chop you into
itty-bitty little pieces, my friend.

208
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:15,566
Just like they done to that piggo
over at that fucking crazy farm.

209
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:26,164
You big dildo. Eat your fucking slop.

210
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:30,851
Ain`t l make the best
God damn stew in the world?

211
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,045
Best God damn stew in the world!

212
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:39,013
lt`s that God damn coyote,
trying to kill my lot again.

213
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:42,570
l`ll show that bastard
once and for all, Junior.

214
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:52,128
Holy shit! Who the fuck are you
and what the fuck do you want?

215
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:55,250
l`d like to earn a meal.

216
00:30:55,295 --> 00:31:00,688
- Yeah? What do you do?
- Whatever you need done.

217
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:05,251
OK. Clean all the shit
out of the chicken coop

218
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:07,251
and dump it behind the shed.

219
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:11,288
You come back here after that
and l`ll fill your stomach.

220
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:14,294
Yes, ma`am.

221
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:25,245
That is one fucking ugly man
that goes there.

222
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:30,050
- One fucking ugly man, Mama.
- Would you shut your trap?!

223
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:32,734
You ain`t so pretty yourself,
you know.

224
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:34,925
l ain`t so pretty myself, l know.

225
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:45,326
l want every inch of this area
combed thoroughly.

226
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:49,766
- Bring back anything you find.
- Yes, sir.

227
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:58,850
- What the hell`s going on here?
- You talking to me, Sheriff?

228
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:02,772
l thought you was talking to me.

229
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:07,570
No, Roy. lt`s OK.
Go ahead. Get them out of here.

230
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:21,370
Looks like we got us a maniac
on the loose, huh, Sheriff?

231
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:42,726
Lana! Hey, Lana!

232
00:32:44,415 --> 00:32:46,849
Sorry, buster. We`re closed.

233
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:49,363
lt`s OK,
l just want a take-out order.

234
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:52,725
You do? What would you like?

235
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:55,005
l`d like Lana to go with nothing on.

236
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:57,687
And who wants her?

237
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,970
The pride of the Unger
lnstitute of Mental Health,

238
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:06,566
who`s dumped his last bedpan
and would like very much to party.

239
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:10,927
Lana...
l don`t know, l`ll have to ask her.

240
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:15,173
Hey, Lana. You want Billy?
You sure?

241
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:20,328
She wants you, too. But you`ll
have to wait till she`s done.

242
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,928
There. l`m going to party.

243
00:33:39,295 --> 00:33:42,093
lt`s show time!

244
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,214
That`s it.

245
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:57,967
That`s it. That`s the whole
fucking thing right there.

246
00:33:58,695 --> 00:34:01,732
There it is.
You just stay right there, doll.

247
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:08,172
That`s just what the doctor ordered.
A little preventive medicine.

248
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:12,333
And the forecast is...
cloudy in the mountains,

249
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:16,812
sunny in the valleys,
and snow flurries up your nose.

250
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:08,965
Girl, you are so hot.

251
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:35,170
What the fuck is she doing?

252
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:42,688
Jesus Christ! Come on, will you?

253
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,244
You bad kitty.
l don`t like you any more.

254
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:02,412
l feed you,
and you scare me like that.

255
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,246
Go on, kitty.

256
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,212
Sorry.

257
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:24,768
Billy, what are you doing?
lt`s cold.

258
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:38,404
This is cute.
l like this. A whole lot.

259
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:51,972
You`ll waste a lot of money
this way, smartie.

260
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:55,007
Oh, well,
that just means more for me.

261
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,646
Yummy.

262
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:05,729
Oh, my God. Billy!

263
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:20,409
l don`t care if you have to put
your fucking mother behind bars!

264
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:24,653
Get me the God damn psycho
who`s responsible for this mess.

265
00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:29,974
l mean, shit, Tucker,
what the hell`s going on here?

266
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:32,848
l mean, this is a small town, man.

267
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:36,285
And small towns
are supposed to be safe.

268
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,686
l know who it is.

269
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:52,566
- What?
- l said, l know who it is.

270
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:57,609
- Who?
- lt`s Jason Voorhees.

271
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:01,572
Jason Voorhees?

272
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:06,010
You`re out of your mind!
You`ve been in the sun too long.

273
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:11,652
Jason is dead! His body was cremated.
He`s nothing but a handful of ash.

274
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:16,643
You know that for sure, Mayor?
Did you see him cremated?

275
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:19,687
Jason Voorhees.
l can`t believe this!

276
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:26,012
Here, this is your
Jason Voorhees, here. This.

277
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:35,814
Your ass is on the line here,
Tucker. Are you getting that?

278
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:39,211
You get me a God damn live suspect!

279
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:02,488
- You fuck! You really scared me.
- You loved it.

280
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,489
- You want more?
- Eddie, we can`t.

281
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,527
- Matt will kill us.
- Fuck him.

282
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:17,205
- Fuck you.
- Exactly. Fuck me.

283
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:21,373
Come on. Come on.

284
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:24,087
Come on.

285
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:42,045
Watch the dirt. Watch the dirt.

286
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:07,212
- What?
- Wait a minute.

287
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,246
Especially for the occasion.

288
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,975
- l`ll go wash up.
- OK, sugar.

289
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,967
- Hurry back.
- l`m hurrying.

290
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:54,289
l`m back.

291
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:58,526
What is this? Sleeping?

292
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:37,814
- Let`s get this show on the road!
- Wait a minute, l`m coming.

293
00:44:37,855 --> 00:44:39,686
l just don`t understand it.

294
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:44,246
Reggie, l want you to be
a good kid with Pam.

295
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:48,334
- She`s doing us both a great favour.
- lf she ever gets here.

296
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,173
Don`t go getting
into trouble with Demon.

297
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:54,764
All right! Pam! Come on!

298
00:44:54,815 --> 00:45:00,128
Tina and Eddie will show up when
they get hungry, so stop worrying.

299
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:03,008
l`m not worried any more.
l`m just pissed.

300
00:45:03,055 --> 00:45:04,283
Stop it.

301
00:45:11,495 --> 00:45:15,408
Take Tommy with you. lt`ll probably
do him good to get away.

302
00:45:16,295 --> 00:45:18,251
Yeah, that`s a good idea.

303
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:22,643
Tommy! Pam`s taking Reggie
to see his brother tonight.

304
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:26,574
- Why don`t you go too?
- Great idea. Let`s go.

305
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:31,045
Go see what you can do.

306
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,411
Come on. lt`ll be fun.

307
00:45:52,175 --> 00:45:53,972
Good.

308
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:58,886
- Come on.
- No. l`ll wait here.

309
00:46:58,935 --> 00:47:00,926
- Come on.
- l`m OK.

310
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,652
Yo, Demon!

311
00:47:06,695 --> 00:47:10,051
- ls that the big bad wolf?
- Yeah. Open up!

312
00:47:10,095 --> 00:47:13,007
- That you, Reckless?
- Open up!

313
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:17,325
Oh, my God!
Get your ass in here, boy!

314
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,928
God, it`s to good see you!
Damn, you look good!

315
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:23,772
l know, l know.

316
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:27,171
Oh, God. Look at this.
You had any dinner?

317
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:34,047
- Here. Have an enchilada. Man...
- Where`d you get those bad rings?

318
00:47:34,095 --> 00:47:37,804
lf you`d lived as long as
your big brother, you`d get things.

319
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:42,727
Freaking ``A``! Where`d you get that?

320
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:48,009
Calm down, dude. Say hello
to Anita. She`s my girlfriend.

321
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:51,889
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hey, little brother.

322
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,495
l want you to meet somebody.

323
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:57,493
Hey, Pam!
Come here, baby, come here.

324
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:01,323
This is my friend Pam.
She`s my girlfriend.

325
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:04,731
What`s up, Pam?

326
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:21,326
Pam, you hungry? Want a taco?
What about a slice of pizza?

327
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:23,286
- No.
- Cheese and sausage.

328
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:27,772
What about you, brother?
You want a beer? Get out of here.

329
00:48:27,815 --> 00:48:31,410
l`ll tell you what.
Why don`t you take this?

330
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:37,607
- Man, this is bad!
- Nothing`s too good for my brother.

331
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:39,611
Gonna give me this, too?

332
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:23,006
l got you, didn`t l?
Really scared you, didn`t l?

333
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:26,249
Are you dumb or something?

334
00:49:32,495 --> 00:49:34,486
You`re a crazy from the loony bin!

335
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:41,767
My mama`s going to chop you up
into itty-bitty pieces, my friend!

336
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:47,214
You hear me?
l said, are you hearing me?

337
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:50,451
l said, are you hearing me?!

338
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:54,926
Fuck you, lunatic!

339
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:35,374
Reggie, we`ve got to go now.

340
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:38,612
- OK, bro. Take care.
- Thanks for the dinner.

341
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:41,249
- Anytime.
- Stay cool, baby.

342
00:50:41,295 --> 00:50:44,207
- Stay safe, Reckless!
- l will!

343
00:50:54,895 --> 00:50:58,854
- You know, l miss him already.
- Yeah, he`s a cutie pie.

344
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:00,965
- Want to hit this?
- Yeah.

345
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:03,368
What`s wrong?

346
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,165
- You OK?
- lt`s them damn enchiladas.

347
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:12,326
You gonna be all right?

348
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:40,206
Who`s that?

349
00:51:41,775 --> 00:51:43,003
Stop it!

350
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:46,133
Stop it!

351
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,646
You`re gonna get it, bitch!

352
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,813
Lighten up, Demon. You`ll feel
a lot better after you shit.

353
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:04,453
l`ll feel a lot better when l`m out
of here. This shit box is gross!

354
00:52:04,495 --> 00:52:08,647
Watch out for snakes.
They`ll crawl up and bite your ass.

355
00:52:40,815 --> 00:52:44,125
Anita? Hey, girl, what`s up?

356
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,127
OK. l told you this isn`t funny.

357
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:01,846
Now you`re gonna get it, bitch.

358
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:05,093
M-Matt`s gone. G-George, too.

359
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:07,365
- Are you sure?
- l l-looked.

360
00:54:07,415 --> 00:54:10,088
Tina and Eddie
haven`t come back either.

361
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:14,492
- W-where are they?
- lt`s OK. Calm down, Jake.

362
00:54:14,535 --> 00:54:18,448
Let`s take this slowly.
Where did Matt say he was going?

363
00:54:18,495 --> 00:54:20,884
- He didn`t.
- Yes, he did.

364
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:23,369
He went looking for Tina and Eddie.

365
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:26,487
W-where`s Tommy?
Wasn`t he with you?

366
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:30,323
- And where`s Gramps?
- l don`t know, Reggie.

367
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,443
Why don`t you all go inside?
l`m gonna go find everyone.

368
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,771
- Jake, l`m putting you in charge.
- Yes.

369
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:43,731
And you, Reckless, l want you in bed
asleep when l get back, right?

370
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:45,527
No problem.

371
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:19,851
l`m making your dinner, Junior!
You hearing me, fella?

372
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:23,683
He hurt me, Ma! They hurt me!

373
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:32,689
l am making your dinner!

374
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:54,166
They hurt me, Ma!
Will you murder `em?!

375
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:59,289
Chop `em and kill `em?!
Do you hear me?

376
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:04,363
Get off that fucking bike
and come here and eat my stew!

377
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:20,648
About time, you fuck wad.

378
00:56:22,575 --> 00:56:25,965
l knew you couldn`t pass up
on my stew.

379
00:56:29,895 --> 00:56:35,527
You hearing me, Junior?
You talk. You dumb?

380
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:55,406
lt`s so lonely here.

381
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:59,927
Like we were the only two people left
in the whole world.

382
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:07,446
Maybe we are. Maybe when we get back,
everybody will have disappeared.

383
00:58:07,495 --> 00:58:09,850
l`d like that, wouldn`t you?

384
00:58:18,335 --> 00:58:20,212
Robin,

385
00:58:21,135 --> 00:58:26,767
w-we`ve b-been here
nearly eight months now, right?

386
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,564
T-that`s a long time
to get to know somebody.

387
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:38,290
- Jake, please.
- Sure, sure.

388
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:42,804
We could go anywhere we wanted,

389
00:58:42,855 --> 00:58:45,767
and live in the biggest house
in the world.

390
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:50,969
l`d like to live in a little house,
just big enough for the two of us.

391
00:58:54,895 --> 00:58:58,331
Only there`ll be
more than two of us.

392
00:59:05,415 --> 00:59:08,612
l l-like you, Robin...

393
00:59:10,055 --> 00:59:13,491
- A lot.
- l like you, too, Jake.

394
00:59:14,415 --> 00:59:18,010
You do? A lot?

395
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:21,206
What are you talking about, Jake?

396
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,605
l want to be with you.

397
00:59:29,655 --> 00:59:34,524
l-l r-really
do want to be with you.

398
00:59:36,455 --> 00:59:40,448
l-l w-want to m-make love with you.

399
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,765
- l can`t...
- l-l didn`t mean it.

400
00:59:55,015 --> 00:59:56,926
l...l didn`t mean it.

401
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,693
l-l said l...l didn`t mean it!

402
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:53,087
Vi, l-l`d l-like to talk to you.

403
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:58,053
- l n-need to talk to you!
- Can it wait?

404
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:03,692
No.

405
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:40,251
Reggie. Reggie? Come on.
Reggie, wake up.

406
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:42,645
lt`s time to go to bed.

407
01:01:42,695 --> 01:01:45,163
Reggie, wake up. Reggie!

408
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,451
OK, your way.

409
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:37,851
Jake, l`m sorry.

410
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:43,254
You know, sometimes, Robin,
you are just so stupid.

411
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:34,129
What are them nuts up to now?

412
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:07,571
Yo, Tommy. You back?
Tommy, you in here?

413
01:06:28,855 --> 01:06:33,292
What is it, Reggie? lt`s Pam.
What`s the matter? What`s the matter?

414
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:38,409
- lt`s me! What is it? What is it?!
- ln Tommy`s room!

415
01:06:38,455 --> 01:06:43,324
All right. You stay here.
Relax. l`ll be right back.

416
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:09,689
Move!

417
01:07:11,855 --> 01:07:13,083
Get up!

418
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:32,046
Shit!

419
01:07:34,415 --> 01:07:37,009
Run! Come on! Let`s go!

420
01:08:09,975 --> 01:08:11,966
Help us!

421
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:10,332
Pam, where are you?!

422
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:43,971
lt`s OK, Reggie. lt`s OK. lt`s OK.

423
01:11:58,575 --> 01:12:00,372
God.

424
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:10,366
God.

425
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:54,405
Yeah! All right! Yeah!

426
01:15:09,135 --> 01:15:11,171
Run, Tommy, run!

427
01:15:12,215 --> 01:15:14,809
Run! He`ll kill you!

428
01:15:14,855 --> 01:15:17,244
- Jason?
- Listen to me!

429
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:20,412
Run! Go! Tommy, get out!

430
01:15:20,455 --> 01:15:23,094
- Jason?
- Get out!

431
01:15:23,135 --> 01:15:25,410
Listen! Oh, Tommy, go!

432
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:32,612
- Tommy!
- Remember.

433
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:35,566
Don`t.

434
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:40,172
- Remember.
- Die!

435
01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:14,206
Up here, Tommy! Up here! Come on!

436
01:16:15,455 --> 01:16:17,969
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, up here!

437
01:16:18,015 --> 01:16:21,007
- Come on!
- Come on! Hurry up!

438
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:23,606
Tommy, hurry up!

439
01:16:23,655 --> 01:16:25,566
Come on, come on!

440
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,732
Tommy, you can do it!
Come on, Tommy!

441
01:16:28,775 --> 01:16:32,006
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, hurry up!

442
01:16:32,055 --> 01:16:34,569
Take my hand. Take my hand!

443
01:16:34,615 --> 01:16:38,972
Come on, yeah!
Just one more, Tommy! Come on!

444
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,128
Come on, you can do it!

445
01:18:59,455 --> 01:19:03,573
Please! Please,
somebody help me! Pam!

446
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:25,253
How are you doing?

447
01:20:42,215 --> 01:20:43,568
Quite a kid.

448
01:20:47,815 --> 01:20:49,567
We found this on Roy.

449
01:20:51,135 --> 01:20:54,889
The kid who was axed
at the wood pile was Roy`s son.

450
01:20:56,495 --> 01:21:01,489
God only knows why Roy kept it
hidden all these years, but he did.

451
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:04,129
Roy was a real loner.

452
01:21:05,295 --> 01:21:09,368
Never talked much,
not even to the other paramedics.

453
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,935
l guess when
he was called to the scene,

454
01:21:15,975 --> 01:21:19,684
and saw that it was his own Joey
all hacked to pieces...

455
01:21:24,895 --> 01:21:26,851
We also found these.

456
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:37,533
l guess he used the Jason thing
to...cover up with.

457
01:22:47,615 --> 01:22:49,128
Hi.

458
01:25:15,055 --> 01:25:17,171
Oh, my God.
