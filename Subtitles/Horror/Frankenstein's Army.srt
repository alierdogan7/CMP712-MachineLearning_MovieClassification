180
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,234
This is more like a factory.

181
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,807
Fuck...

182
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,816
Novikov:
<i>Sasha!</i>

183
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,718
None of your stupid games here, huh?

184
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,687
They could be dangerous.

185
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,895
Dimitri:
<i>(Whispering) Sasha.</i>

186
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,898
<i>Sasha, go down there,</i>
<i>see if you can find the light switch.</i>

187
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,800
Why?

188
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,902
<i>'Cause we need more light.</i>

189
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,106

<i>Sasha. Sasha!</i>

192
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,935
- What?
- <i>See if you can get the generator started.</i>

193
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,470
Why?

194
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,872
<i>Don't argue; Just do it!</i>

195

200
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,334
Hey, look it what we have found.

201
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,078
Novikov:

202
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,280
Sasha, is that you?!

Dimitri:
<i>What the...?</i>

209
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,135
- Novikov: <i>Vassili,</i> don't.
- <i>Don't touch it, vassili!</i>

210
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,574
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

211
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,243
<i>I think it's blind. I don't think it can see us, huh?</i>

212
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,019
What are you?

213
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,022
Can you hear me?

214
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,890
Let's put you out of your misery.

215
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,992
Sergei: <i>Misha!</i>

Oh, my God, Misha.

I'm not going anywhere.

Don't move, don't move.

230
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,171
Sasha, for God's sake, turn that thing off!

Sergei: Calling mother.
Do you read me? Over.

234
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,738
Do you read me? Over.

(Sighs)

236
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,713
We've been jammed.

237
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,449
It's the only explanation.

238
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:41,452
It's been days since I got a scratch out
of the damn thing.

239
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:44,054
What if we use the tower?

240
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,757
That's not a bad idea.

241
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,160
Not a bad idea.

242
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,063
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja! Vasja!</i>

243
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,466
<i>We are here now. You heard their mayday.</i>

244
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:57,334
<i>Our boys need help.</i>

245
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,336
Where the fuck are they then, huh?

246
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,105
<i>Listen, we need to search the village properly.</i>

247
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,442
<i>Otherwise, novikov has died for nothing.</i>

248
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:08,746
(Sighs)
He's right, vasja.

249
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,482
Take the others.
I'll stay here with Sasha and the gear.

250
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,250
Go to the village, fine someone...

251
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,553
anyone... who can tell us what is going on here.

252
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,788
Correct me if I'm wrong, seryosha.

253
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,124
But I'm next in command after novikov.

254
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,027
I don't think so. Look at the stripes.

255
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,562
Who gives a fuck about stripes?!

256
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,464
I have been with this unit longer than anyone.

257
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,499
That doesn't mean you're in charge, vasja!

258
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,067
Oh, no?
(Chuckles)

259
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,569
Well, let's ask the others.

260
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,204
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja, sergei's right.</i>

261
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:34,572
Shut the fuck up, you Jew boy!

262
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,474
You are here just to make pretty pictures.

263
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,476
Ivan:
<i>Vasja, you're too smart to be in charge.</i>

264
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,377
Let seryosha have his fun.

265
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,813
We can always slit his throat later.

266
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,282
Sasha:
<i>Alexei?</i>

267
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,284
Sasha?

268
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:49,186
You want him to be in command?

269
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,589
<i>The fucking radio ham?</i>

270
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,290
<i>He's not even Russian.</i>

<i>Okay.</i>

We're supposed to get a prisoner, remember?

294
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,636
To interrogate, find out where our boys are.

295
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,372
Yeah?

Dimitri:
<i>Something about stealing his rabbits.</i>

299
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,415
Oh, no no no no no no. No no no.

300
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:02,252
I'm liberating your rabbits from fascist oppression.

301
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,956
- What is this place?!
- I do not understand.

302
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,391
What is this?!

00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,393
Dimitri:
<i>If you let me...</i>

304
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,395
<i>I have experience in these sort of...</i>

- <i>Interviews.</i>
<i>- Interviews, yeah?</i>

306
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,333
This I want to see.

307
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,412
What is going on here, huh?

308
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,781
Where has everybody gone?

309
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,586
Everybody's dead or run away.

310
00:27:35,588 --> 00:27:38,355
What were they running from?

311
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,428
That's a weird camera.

312
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,563
Is that a microphone?

313
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,565
Are you recording sound?

314
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,235
I've never seen a camera like this before.

- ...The doctor makes.

320

Where is the doctor now?

322

Shut it! Who give a fuck about this doctor?!

323
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,491
We want to know about tiger bear 3-0-3.

Ivan, hold him!

325
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,728
Comrade, listen. There was obviously

326
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,730
some sort of secret project going on here.

327
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,732
Ha, that's obvious, is it?

328
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,368
Tiger bear was even
sent here for this very reason.

329
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,370
Listen, if you find the doctor, you'll probably find...

330
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,805
fucking fascinating, comrade!

331
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,606
Now get the fuck behind the camera.

332
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,442
<i>We have wasted enough time.</i>

333
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:38,482
Where are the Russians?!

00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:41,018
- Where?!
- I don't know. Aah!

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,020
(Screaming)

336
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:45,355
I just feed the animals.

339
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,729
I'll take you there.

340
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,497
Oh, you'll take me there?

341
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,766
You will never have to worry
about getting hurt ever again.

342
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:58,502
- (Screaming)
- Come on, let's go.

343
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,375
Keep moving!

344
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,778
Dimitri:
<i>Vasja, do you think this is wise?</i>

345
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,713
Shut up.

346
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,349
<i>What if there are more like</i>
<i>the ones in the church, huh?</i>

347
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,817
Here.

348
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,630
It's down there.

349
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,432
The Russian soldiers are down there?

350
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,900
Yes.

351
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,540
Down there?!

352
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,076
Yeah, you... you go, you'll see.

353
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,611
It's not safe here, vasja.

354
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,412
Let's just take him back to seryosha.

355
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,548
I'm in charge here, so fucking do what I tell you!

Those things, they appeared out of nowhere.

They could all around us

This is your fault!

You're an educated man, dima.

(Exhales deeply)

451
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,713
Only the Nazis would think of something like this.

(Sighs)

453
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:23,053
Sewing dead people together...

And giving them knives for hands.

455
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,025

We'll move in the morning.

Tiger bear 3-0-3.

463

They're dead.

464

- Dimitri: <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

896
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:48,016
Come in. Go go go, follow me.

897
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:49,751
- Come.
- (Machines drilling)

898
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,820
Oh, don't be shy. Come.

899
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,558
My father said, "men would be more efficient

900
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,928
if they had hammers and screwdrivers

901
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,930
instead of fingers."

902
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:04,833
Here. Use this.

903
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,002
When I tried to do it with cats,

904
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:09,838
he told me it was a sin against God.

905
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,276
He... he beat me.

906
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:17,545
It's not a sin. It's simple mechanics, engineering.

907
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,849
(Sniffs) Ugh.

908
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:22,984
Well...

909
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:25,086
after father died,

910
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,856
the Nazis closed the factory
and sent me to a camp.

911
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,962
Someone told the <i>sturmbahnfuhrer about my cats.</i>

912
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:37,766
He asked me if I could do the same with people.

913
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,101
(Trilling)

914
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:44,739
So I used grandfather's notes.

915
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:47,108
His techniques were quite good.

916
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:53,014
- He needed thunderstorms, but now...
- <i>(Sawing)</i>

917
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:55,917
...I can do it with a generator.

918
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:58,053
<i>That's fascinating, Viktor.</i>

919
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:00,055
<i>Can you explain how your automatons</i>

920
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:01,790

921
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,125
- <i>(bell ringing)</i>
<i>- What did you say?!</i>

922
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,628
They're not machines or puppets!

923
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,029
<i>Sorry sorry, I...</i>

924
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:10,198
like the toys my father built!

925
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,370
Each one is still alive.

926
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,973
- <i>I see...</i>
<i>- they even need to eat.</i>

927
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,976
Go, hurry up.

928
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:24,112
I feed them with the same <i>eintopf</i>

929
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,781
- I gave you.
- <i>Yes...</i>

930
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:27,949
Oh oh!

931
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:29,818
Well, fuck you!

932
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,153
- Fuck you!
- Here they are!

933
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,358
At least one is still alive.

934
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,393
Fuck you! Fuck you!

935
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:39,828
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you all.

936
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,096
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you!

937
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:42,864
Fuck you! Fuck you.

- Fuck... son of a...

940
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,703
Shit. He'll be fine.

941
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:50,839
He'll be fine. I take care of him.

942
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,907
- (Gurgling scream)
- Come come come.

943
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,784
<i>Incredible.</i>

944
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:03,985

945
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:06,054
<i>I want to show you something!</i>

946

- Come in.
- <i>Yes yes, I'm coming.</i>

947
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:14,996
Come in.

948
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:16,931
I want to show you something.

949
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,773
This is the generator.

950
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:26,908
- <i>I see.</i>
<i>- Look.</i>

951

(Zapping)

952
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,748
It works! Ha ha!

953
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,883
It works!

954
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,018
<i>Genius. This is genius!</i>

955
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,887
Come with me. Come.

956
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:40,822
I'll show you something else.

957
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,158
<i>Doctor...</i>

958

<i>Can't you hear it?</i>

961
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:53,034
What was that?

962
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:55,437
<i>It's us... the red army.</i>

963
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:56,938
<i>Our artillery.</i>

How far away would you say they are?

965
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:03,945
<i>15 kilometers.</i>
<i>They could be here in a matter of hours.</i>

966

967
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:08,950
<i>I am here to offer you a deal.</i>

968
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:12,187
<i>Our military leadership is</i>
<i>very interested in your work.</i>

969
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:14,255
Of course.

970
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:17,258
It would give them a weapon
to use against Western allies.

971
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,261
To turn the whole world
into to socialist utopia, right?

972
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,231
<i>Yes. We understand each other very well.</i>

973
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,268
And if I refuse?

974
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:30,472
<i>We'll bomb you and your army</i>

- In experiments...

...the fresher the specimens the better.

980
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:57,532
And if I can use flesh that is still alive,

981
01:08:57,534 --> 01:08:59,868
I can perform miracles.

982
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,304
<i>Still alive?</i>

Is a better communist?

985
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:11,846
<i>What?</i>

986
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,983
Which of these two is a better communist?

01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:40,341
Viktor...
(Speaking in German)

996
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:44,879
Hush now, dieter. You don't have to apologize.

997
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:47,148
I'm going to make it all okay.

998
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,584
Doctor, there's no time!
The red army's almost here.

999
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:52,320
- If you want to work for me you need to tell me now.
- Enough!

1000
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:55,089
I said I would think about it. Now focus.

1001
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,226
<i>Nein.</i>

1002
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:59,561

Hey!

<i>What are you doing?</i>

1008
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:51,312
Don't you see?

1009
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:53,314
I can... I can end the war

1010
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:55,216
by creating a new being

1011
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:58,319
that brings them together.

1012
01:10:58,321 --> 01:11:01,623
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1013
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,626
I can make them stop.

1014
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:07,195
I can make them understand each other.

1015
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,307
I'll be right back.

1016
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,212
Dima...

Don't you understand?

1023
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:47,001

Yeah.

Yeah. That will be...

The patient is no longer breathing.

1053

Now...

01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,889
You will be safe.

1074
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,691
What about our deal?!

1075
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:59,660
I'm afraid I am going to have to
refuse your generous offer.

1076
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,662
You are signing your own death warrant.

1077
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,365
If we don't kill you, your own people will.
Understand that?

1078
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:05,600
Oh, yes, I know.

1079
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,635
I was in a prison camp, remember?

1080
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:09,937
But I have other plans.

1081
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:12,273
No no no no, don't leave me! Don't go!

1082
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,609
- Ah!
- I'll be leaving momentarily.

1083
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:18,179
But there should be time for one last experiment.

1084
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,518
No, you can't... you can't.

1085
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,286
I can. I can!

1086
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:26,721
Come here, come here.

1087
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:29,724
Now what shall we do with you?

1088
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,926
Maybe... maybe I will

1089
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:34,929
build this camera into your skull.

1090
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:37,498
That might be fun.
(Grunts)

1091
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:43,471
(Groans)

1092
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:52,780
A man... a man of vision is always misunderstood.

1093
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:58,686
But the film in your camera...

1094
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:01,422
Will convince the doubters.

1095
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:03,724
- You're insane!
- (Laughing)

1096
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:07,228
You're not a doctor. You're sick! You're sick!

1097
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,764
Oh, yes?! So I'm sick?

1098
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:14,769
Everybody's sick... the Nazis, communists,

1099
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:17,271
capitalists, everyone!

1100
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:19,540
The sickness cannot be cured...

1101
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,309
So it must be cut out.

1102
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:22,710
And my creations will do that.

1103
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:24,712
Your creations are fucking insanity!

1104
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:27,448
Look at them! They're fucking cripples!

1105
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,351
Okay.

1106
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:33,788
My father...

1107
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:36,424
Tried to have me locked up.

1108
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:40,494
- He said I was emotionally crippled.
- (Laughing maniacally)

1109
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,802
I had no choice.

1110
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:52,306
I injected him with...
with a drug that paralyzed him.

1111
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:55,710
But his eyes could still move,
so he could watch as I...

1112
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:57,345
(screaming)
No no no, no no no!

1114
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:02,617
What was that?

1115
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:05,620
That is the beginning of the carpet bombardment.

1116
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:08,356
I will not have time for you after all...

1117

1118
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,429
That is my comrades!

1119
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:18,899

I will make it better. Anything anything!

1123
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:32,380
Tell me what you need. I will guarantee you!

1124
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:35,383
Okay okay okay, I'm afraid after I go...

1125
01:17:35,385 --> 01:17:37,652
My soldiers may become a bit crazy.

1130

1131
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,766
<i>They will turn up against each other</i>

1132
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:54,468
<i>and anything else they find nearby.</i>

1133
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,441
I would love to tell you more,

1134
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:02,843
but I've got to go.

1135
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,479
So good luck, comrade.

1136
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:08,549
(Groaning)
Oh, the film.

1137
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,821
Proof for the doubters

1138
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:16,624
- to make them believe.
- Ah!

1139
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,764
But it won't reveal my real secrets,
do you know why?

1140
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,801
Look at me. Do you know why?

1141
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:30,571
Because they are all locked up in here.

1142
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:33,441
So I'm going to take your camera with me.
