Well, Julie is sitting on a hot

Why don't you give her a call and tell
her he's a hundred percent cured?

867
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:17,698
- Ninety-nine.
- One percent.

868

Now, that percent has
got me in a corner.

869

He's still on the razor's
edge of a mental breakdown.

- I sure did.

Since he was just a puppy.
