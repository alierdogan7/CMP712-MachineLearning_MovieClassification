1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,741
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>
<i>So many dead people.</i>

2
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:30,124
<i>So many victims.</i>
<i>It all started a few days ago...</i>

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,174
<i>when I came here for a rave.</i>

4
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:35,116
<i>And, now, all that remains</i>
<i>is the rotten smell of death.</i>

5
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:43,373
You must stop Curien...

6
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,635
or else something terrible will happen!

7
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:11,207
Nice. So, where are they, dude?
We're gonna miss the boat.

8
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,874
<i>Greg and Simon.</i>

9
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,399
<i>Greg's the guy</i>
<i>I played ball with in college.</i>

10
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:18,788
<i>A good guy, if not a little goofy.</i>

11
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:23,020
<i>Simon. They say God doesn't give</i>
<i>with two hands, and they were right.</i>

12
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:25,804
<i>He got the looks,</i>
<i>but not much between those ears.</i>

13
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:31,753
<i>Cynthia... Greg's girlfriend.</i>
<i>Pure eye candy.</i>

14
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,481
I'm Simon.

15
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:36,813
<i>Karma. Thinks she's Foxy Brown.</i>

16
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,516
<i>She has a crush on Simon, but Simon</i>
<i>only has eyes for Alicia, my ex.</i>

17
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,778
<i>We broke up a few weeks ago</i>
<i>so I could study and she could fence.</i>

18
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:47,595
<i>She loves it.</i>
<i>I don't see what it's good for.</i>

19
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:50,826
Anyone have one of those invitations
with the map on it?

20
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,205
Are you sure this is where
the boat's supposed to leave from?

21
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,960
Maybe Johnnie gave you the wrong info.

22
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,266
Yeah, hon.
I'm pretty sure.

23
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:03,817
It says here the boat
doesn't leave until 5:00.

24
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:07,398
Yeah, and it's 5:15 now, Simon.

25
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,030
Shit. We're so fucked.

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,010
<i>They missed the boat to the rave.</i>

27
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,670
<i>If only they decided</i>
<i>to stay back in Seattle...</i>

28
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,651
<i>they'd all be alive today.</i>

29
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,486
Unbelievable. It's going on all weekend.
You gotta come.

30
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,263
And you'll never guess who's here.

31
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:15,592
Hello? The cell phone reception's
for shit out here.

32
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,958
Hello, sweetie? I'm losing you.
Are you there?

33
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,286
Hello? Shit!

34
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:24,799
Now, where was it
you wanted to take me to?

35
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,189
<i>I was trying my best</i>
<i>to function as a single guy should.</i>

36
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,940
<i>But at the back of my head, something</i>
<i>was nibbling away at my subconscious.</i>

37
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,061
Hello?

38
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,461
What you doin' over there?

39
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,599
Good evening.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

40
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,092
You got yourself some sort
of hearin' disability?

41
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,883
I asked you a question.

42
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,804
I've come to charter your boat, sir.

43
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,546
You do, huh?
Well, that's too bad...

44
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,296
'cause this here's a fishin' boat,
not the <i>Pacific Princess.</i>

45
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,307
Why don't you try the yellow pages?

46
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,862
We gotta get to this party on an island,
and we were hopin' to use your boat.

47
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,907
You're not the sharpest tool
in the shed, are ya?

48
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:22,975
I said, shove off!
Or don't you <i>sprechen Sie Englisch?</i>

49
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:25,248
Why don't you just name your price,
and we can skip...

50
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:26,909
the old-man-on-the-sea routine.

51
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,386
A man's gotta eat, right?

52
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,234
What part of"shove off"
didn't you understand?

53
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,307
Hold it.

54
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,290
Geez. Who's the U-boat commander?

55
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:39,740
- What?
- How much?

56
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:42,878
$300 sound fair?

57
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:45,532
- About 600 might.
- Six hundred? No way.

58
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:48,156
No one is talking to you.
Where are you headed, girls?

59
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,715
- Huh?
- I don't know. We got this map.

60
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:54,910
It's somewhere in the San Juans.
You must know where that is, right?

61
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,353
You crazy?

62
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,753
- They crazy.
- No, I don't think so.

63
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:01,022
- Excuse me?
- I said, forget it.

64
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,999
Yeah, forget it. Forget it.

65
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:05,823
- That means stop talkin', start walkin'.
- Why?

66
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,338
Why? Why? Why?
They always ask "why."

67
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,647
You know what they call this island?

68
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,918
<i>Isle del Morte.</i>

69
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:18,720
<i>Morte.</i> That's Spanish for "death,"
in case you don't speak Mexican.

70
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:21,502
Well, listen, friend,
I got me an island to catch right here.

71
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,503
And if this is some lame attempt
to hit me up for more cash...

72
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,300
It ain't.

73
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,150
There ain't enough cash in the world
to make us go back there.

74
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,999
- Keep the cash. Keep the cash.
- Let's get out of here.

75
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:33,471
Fuck it. A grand.

76
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:39,835
What do you say 500 now,
and another five on the way back?

77
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:43,253
You can be mighty persuasive
if you wanna be, <i>Mr...</i>

78
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,229
- Simon Cruz. And you are?
- Kirk's the name.

79
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:50,423
Wait, wait. Captain Kirk?

80
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,950
Does that make him Mr. Spock?

81
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,436
I don't like no Captain Kirk jokes.

82
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:02,940
Now, let's shove off before
you say something else you'll regret.

83
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,903
All right.

84
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,444
It's all good.

85
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,809
Cap'n! Cap'n!

86
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,807
I'm not goin'.
I'm not goin'.

87
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:20,885
There's evil spirits on that island.

88
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:26,324
You just get the deck lines and let me
worry about the evil spirits, okay?

89
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,284
<i>Ahoy there, Captain Kirk.</i>

90
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,894
<i>This is the</i>
<i>United States Marine Patrol.</i>

91
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:35,193
<i>Stand down and prepare</i>
<i>to be boarded, Captain.</i>

92
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:39,285
Oh, shit!

93
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:42,039
What are you gonna do?

94
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,752
We have no choice.
We got to do what the lady says.

95
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,787
It'll delay our departure
for a while, though.

96
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,445
Delay us?
For how long?

97
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:55,377
Well, I imagine they're looking
for guns, drugs, who knows what.

98
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,338
It'll probably take 'em a few hours.

99
00:07:57,403 --> 00:08:00,053
And that's only
if they don't find nothin'.

100
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,897
How much to lose 'em?

101
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:06,002
<i>Did you forget what today is?</i>

102
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,929
You can lose them, right?

103
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:10,198
Sure I can.

104
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,632
Who's talking, Alexander Hamilton,
Ben Franklin or you?

105
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:17,138
<i>- It's the second Friday of the month!</i>
- Do it.

106
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,079
<i>Just a routine inspection, Kirk.</i>

107
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:22,543
<i>Don't even think</i>
<i>ofleaving my harbor.</i>

108
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:26,414
<i>Heave to! Where the hell</i>
<i>do you think you're going?</i>

109
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,930
<i>Heave to!</i>

110
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:36,785
<i>This is Casper.</i>
<i>McGyvers and I are moving out. Over.</i>

111
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,830
Hate to break this to you, kid,
but I would have done it for free.

112
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:47,825
The lady needs to dine
on a humble pie once in a while.

113
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:50,895
- So you've run into her before?
- Run into her?

114
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,356
Hell yeah.
She's had a hard-on for me...

115
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,286
ever since we got out of the service...

116
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:58,165
and I didn't start working
for Uncle Sam like she did.

117
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,482
Can't blame her for still
getting wet over me, can ya?

118
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:19,372
Sweet.

119
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,747
- Come on.
- Come on what?

120
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:24,083
Let's go swimming.

121
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,578
Now?

122
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,252
You're crazy.
You're pretty enough to eat.

123
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,733
- You're nuts, baby.
- Come on.

124
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,457
All right.

125
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:52,682
Oh, yeah.

126
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,245
Come on.

127
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,489
Oh, my God.
That's cold, baby.

128
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:05,736
Come on, you big wimp.

129
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:08,529
No, you go.
You have a good swim, babe.

130
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:11,049
Yeah, fine.

131
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:13,707
It's fine once you get in.
Come on, Matt.

132
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,372
You're no fun.

133
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:23,081
<i>He's heading out to</i>
<i>the San Juan Islands, Cap.</i>

134
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,576
<i>Just maintain speed and distance.</i>

135
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,649
<i>I don't want him to make us yet.</i>

136
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,204
- Cynthia's such a trooper.
- Don't come near me.

137
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,158
Must've eaten something
back at the...

138
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,331
You know what?
Whatever you say, baby.

139
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,091
- God, it's cold.
- I know.

140
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,347
Greg, you look like shit, man.
Here.

141
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:04,870
Have another beer.
This'll make you feel better.

142
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:11,021
On my face!

143
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:21,898
Oh, yeah.

144
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,509
- Get back here.
- Come on, Matt!

145
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,548
Come on, Matt.
Don't play games.

146
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,423
Matt, where are you?

147
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,462
What a mess.
What an idiot.

148
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,705
Did you get
a real good peek there, perv?

149
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:11,492
I wanna give this to you.

150
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,625
- What's this for?
- It's for your protection.

151
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,353
It's okay.
I'm on the pill.

152
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:19,456
It'll ward off evil spirits.

153
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:22,047
It'll protect you
and your friends from harm.

154
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,155
Whatever, Gandalf.

155
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,859
Matt, where are you?

156
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,707
I'm lost.
Where are you?

157
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:50,659
What is that?

158
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:08,703
What is this?

159
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,177
Are you in there?

160
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,050
Are you in there?

161
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,024
Is that you, Matt?

162
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:00,544
Oh, my God!

163
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:17,813
<i>Hey, Cap, I can get</i>
<i>a little closer to 'em.</i>

164
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:21,084
<i>Yeah. Let's keep our distance</i>
<i>and see where he's headin'.</i>

165
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:32,030
- Slow down, slow down.
- Come on.

166
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:36,152
Did you hear that?

167
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:11,063
- Shallow water!
- Okay, Salish.

168
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,790
Hey, guys, there it is.

169
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:15,859
Yes!

170
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,420
Yes! Finally!

171
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:26,320
Easy, now.

172
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:28,785
Almost there.

173
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,683
Shut it down!

174
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:41,172
- I'm so excited!
- Finally!

175
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,484
<i>I know where they're docking. Drop me</i>
<i>off on the other side of the island.</i>

176
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,942
<i>- You want me to radio for backup?</i>
<i>- Nah.</i>

177
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:55,887
<i>I think I can handle Victor myself.</i>

178
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,304
- Okeydoke.
- They're on their way.

179
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,183
What do you wanna do now?

180
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:12,274
Let's go. I found a spot
for our merchandise.

181
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:15,442
Start unloading.
If Casper comes after us...

182
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:18,545
she won't find anything
left on board to arrest us for.

183
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,295
Yeah, right up here.

184
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,174
Wait. Wait.
Let me see that a second.

185
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,238
Well, you're obviously no cartographer.

186
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:44,020
- What?
- Come on. It's this way.

187
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,139
- Smart too, isn't she?
- Yep.

188
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,305
Smart enough not to get involved
with the likes of you, bro.

189
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:02,029
- What's this?
- Come on.

190
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:10,603
- Smells like someone farted up there.
- Look at all these bubbles.

191
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:13,492
It's disgusting.

192
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,147
Seems like a storm's comin' up.

193
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,611
Maybe so.
But that's all right.

194
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,984
Keeps Casper off our ass
if she tries coming after us...

195
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,905
while we blow on out of here.

196
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,392
What about the kids?
We can't leave 'em alone.

197
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:50,093
This is a bad island.

198
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:54,602
I ain't waiting around for 'em, not if
we have a chance to slip past Casper.

199
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:57,969
- You'd better keep unloading.
- All right.

200
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,211
Fine.

201
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:02,665
Then we'll come back next week
when the heat is off, huh?

202
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:11,021
- You hear somethin'?
- No, nothing.

203
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,473
- Where is everyone?
- Come on, Karma.

204
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:27,885
I can't believe this.

205
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,188
It's their loss. We have
this entire place to ourselves...

206
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:34,533
to dance the night away,
and I intend to put it to good use.

207
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,257
- I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
- You would say that.

208
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,782
Do you mind if
everybody isn't miserable, like you?

209
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:42,408
Yeah, you know what?
I remember when she used to be fun.

210
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:44,781
When was that, kindergarten?

211
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,292
How funny.
You're funny.

212
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,811
I think something bad's
happened here.

213
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,667
Like what?

214
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,571
Well, they sure as hell did not
go to 7-11 to get more booze...

215
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:06,434
because the keg is full.

216
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,037
- Right on.
- Cheers.

217
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,964
<i>- Chin-chin.</i>
<i>- Salud!</i>

218
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,258
<i>- L 'chaim!</i>
- Well, what the fuck?

219
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:16,772
Doesn't this bother any of you?

220
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,819
We're on the island where the rave of
the year's supposed to be happening...

221
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,747
but it's completely deserted.

222
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,017
Yeah, it worries me.
It worries me there aren't any mixers.

223
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:25,223
Simon cannot survive on Bud alone.

224
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,300
Speak for yourself, dude.

225
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:19,941
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna
go find out where everyone went.

226
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,358
Okay? Is anyone else coming?

227
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,505
Hell no.
Me and Cyn are gonna...

228
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,391
groove to some funky tunes
all night long, right, baby doll?

229
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,846
You know it, sugarplum.

230
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,342
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming with you.

231
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,612
I'm starting to get diabetes
from all this "sugar, sugar" over here.

232
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,046
- What about you, Studly Doolittle?
- Three's not company in this case.

233
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:41,087
I think I'll join you.

234
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:43,648
Good. We need a big,
strong man to protect us.

235
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,108
Problem is, there's never a big,
strong man around when you need one.

236
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,322
All right, let's go.

237
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:56,736
Why do I always end up
doin' this shit work?

238
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:25,466
Cap'n, is that you?

239
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:43,171
Hello, Cleveland!

240
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,090
- Cut it out.
- What? Why?

241
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,294
Because I said so.

242
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:49,087
Said so, huh?
Maybe I should just...

243
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:54,754
Wait, wait, wait.

244
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:56,675
I think I feel some rain coming.

245
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,634
Why don't we... I think it might...
I think it might rain.

246
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:03,707
Why don't we go somewhere
where we won't get wet?

247
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:07,008
Too late.

248
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:16,758
Close the Velcro.
Beautiful Velcro.

249
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,070
- We are gonna do the humpity-bumpity.
- Come on, baby.

250
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:21,047
The humpity-bumpity!

251
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:26,681
- Yeah, baby!
- One, two, three!

252
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if the others come back?

253
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:34,746
- I can be quick.
- What else is new?

254
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:38,013
Hey, don't...
Don't take it personal, Greg.

255
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,079
- A lot of men have these problems.
- I just gotta take a piss.

256
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:43,486
Not in here, you idiot!
Go pee in the bushes!

257
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,079
Christ, I just...

258
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,737
I just gotta go and take a piss is all.

259
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:50,709
- All this beer's gotta go somewhere.
- For God's sakes.

260
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,377
Be right back.

261
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:00,471
- Hello?
- It's so quiet.

262
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:05,369
It's a gorgeous night.
Why don't we play for a little while?

263
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:06,584
Shall we?

264
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,852
Why don't you just stick to
playing with yourself for now?

265
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,747
- By the way, what's with the accent?
- I don't know.

266
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:33,398
Salish, are you done yet?

267
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:24,630
Better hurry back, baby.

268
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:27,545
Mama's gonna give it to ya.

269
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:47,544
Greg, you're scaring me.

270
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,783
Come on, baby.

271
00:26:01,784 --> 00:26:04,685
- Will you get a load of that?
- What the hell is it?

272
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,548
Looks like it was built
a millennia ago.

273
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:09,876
Simon, it's centuries.

274
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,831
Right. Well, that's what I meant.

275
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:14,480
Should we go in?

276
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,325
I am not going in there.

277
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,837
Unless there's a spa and a 24-hour
room service, you're on your own, hon.

278
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,716
Well, are you coming,
or am I going in myself?

279
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,019
Didn't you ever watch <i>Scooby Doo?</i>

280
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,190
This is so not a good idea.

281
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:39,466
I am completely
not in favor of doing this.

282
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:50,033
Well, the candles are lit.
I mean, someone must be home.

283
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:02,665
Hello?

284
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,470
Alicia, watch out!

285
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:12,939
What the fuck?

286
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:17,042
What the hell are you doing here?

287
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:19,856
- Where is everyone?
- Shut the door!

288
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:24,429
You broke my glasses.
Great. Nice.

289
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:27,084
Okay, what is going on here?

290
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,187
We'll show you.

291
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,233
Come on.

292
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:34,477
I've got it on tape.

293
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:44,555
Sorry. I have a lot of footage here.
I'll just fast-forward.

294
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:51,209
Everyone was partying, you know.

295
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:54,663
Drinking and dancing
and just hanging out, having fun.

296
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:57,997
And then these things came
and they attacked the rave.

297
00:27:58,065 --> 00:28:01,196
They started killing everybody.
Those of us that could get away did.

298
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,079
We ran. We finally got to the boat,
but it wasn't there.

299
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:07,848
These things, they just kept
coming and coming and killing.

300
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,985
We found this house.
We ran inside and tried to hide.

301
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:14,732
That's when you guys came.
We thought you were more of them.

302
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,489
"Them"? Who the hell is "them"?

303
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,071
"Who"? Try "what."

304
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:23,492
- Rudy, they were dead people.
- Okay, guys, you saw the tape.

305
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:27,047
Those are reanimated corpses just like
out of a fuckin' Romero movie.

306
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:30,217
- A what?
- A Romero movie.

307
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:32,425
You know, like, the holy trilogy:
<i>Night, Dawn</i> and <i>Day.</i>

308
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:35,593
They say he's gonna make <i>Twilight of</i>
<i>the Dead</i> one day, but I doubt it.

309
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:38,378
Yeah, I find this
all a little hard to believe.

310
00:28:38,445 --> 00:28:40,486
It was a stunt.
It was part of the rave.

311
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,524
- It wasn't a stunt, Alicia.
- You know what?

312
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,314
Simon says let's get out of here
and let the cops ask questions later...

313
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,748
while we're kicking it back in Seattle
selling our story to the <i>Enquirer.</i>

314
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:50,984
Sounds great.
You got a boat?

315
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,092
- Yes, down at the beach.
- Thank God.

316
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,433
Then let's not waste any more time
yakking. Let's just go!

317
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,632
We can't. We still have friends back at
the rave. We're not gonna leave them.

318
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,001
We gotta get out of here
while we still can.

319
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:03,336
We're not leaving without them.

320
00:29:03,404 --> 00:29:05,508
Okay. Let's go.

321
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,841
- So, you came with that girl?
- What?

322
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,266
Let me give you a tip. I don't think
she's a natural red, white and blue.

323
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,834
Met her at the rave.
So, who's your boy over there...

324
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:56,003
with the Tom Cruise smile
and the <i>Rain Man</i> brain?

325
00:29:56,073 --> 00:30:00,513
He just so happens to be the biggest
underwear model in America.

326
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:02,275
Congratulations.

327
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:05,062
- That's great.
- You okay, Simon?

328
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:07,136
Sure.

329
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,085
Where the hell are they?

330
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,316
- Greg? Cindy?
- Please, do not do that.

331
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:26,976
You're being taken, Hugh.

332
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:29,414
This is all just one big practical joke.

333
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,901
If you'd been here, which you weren't,
you wouldn't think it was a joke.

334
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:33,119
Believe me.

335
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,643
What is that?

336
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,274
I'm so not touching that.

337
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,708
Hold this.

338
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:46,235
Let's flip it over.

339
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,034
Liberty.

340
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:05,060
Holy... Dude, what the fuck
happened to you?

341
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,980
I was in there,
and then all of the sudden...

342
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:09,500
the frickin'... the banging,
and then the frickin' thing fell over.

343
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:12,321
And I was stuck inside. Shit!

344
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:16,002
- You're in deep shit, huh?
- That's very funny.

345
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,929
Get that fuckin'...
Who are you?

346
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,694
- Where's Cyn?
- I don't know, bro. You tell me.

347
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,120
We gotta go find her.

348
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,312
Where the fuck did that come from?

349
00:31:48,386 --> 00:31:50,623
What is... Oh, my God!

350
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,398
What is... Cynthia!

351
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:01,504
What the hell was that thing?

352
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:03,357
Our best friend.

353
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,564
Not anymore.

354
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,575
She was like a wild animal.

355
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:10,300
Did you see here face?
Oh, my God!

356
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:13,685
- It's horrible!
- What happened to her?

357
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,615
Everybody hold on a minute.

358
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,102
Maybe I can get us some answers.

359
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:20,314
McGyvers, come in.

360
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,982
This is Casper.
Come in. Over. It's out.

361
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:28,470
I'm not getting anything on the radio.
Anyone have a cell phone?

362
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:30,398
We already tried. It's not working.

363
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:33,496
- There's some sort of interference.
- Look, I don't know what's going on.

364
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,218
What I do know is I've gotta
get you all off this island.

365
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,321
- How did you get here?
- On a boat like everyone else.

366
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,917
But it's gone.
It's been destroyed.

367
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,129
We didn't. We came
in the <i>Lazarus</i> with Kirk.

368
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:45,402
- Where is he?
- He's in the inlet down at the beach.

369
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,575
- Can you take me to him?
- Are you gonna arrest him?

370
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:49,501
Not at the moment.
Right now...

371
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:52,053
I just wanna get you all
as far away from here as possible.

372
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,035
Sounds like a plan to me.

373
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,602
I am so fucking scared, Simon.

374
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:26,454
I know. Me too.

375
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:32,406
I just can't believe Cynthia's dead.

376
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:39,958
I'm so sorry, Alicia.

377
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,760
Quiet, everybody.

378
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,693
Everyone, quiet.

379
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:45,640
Shit!

380
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:01,425
Can we go home now, please?

381
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,806
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

382
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:06,605
- Move it!
- Let's go!

383
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,599
Go!

384
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,435
- Oh, shit!
- Kirk!

385
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:34,927
It's gotta be down here!
It's gotta be down here!

386
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,999
- All right.
- Where is it?

387
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:45,389
- Oh, God, that's not Kirk.
- Simon!

388
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:47,463
- Don't jump in the water!
- Simon, don't!

389
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:50,982
- No, don't!
- Simon, don't go!

390
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:11,564
- Swim, Simon!
- Swim!

391
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:17,035
- Look out!
- Go, go, go!

392
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,403
Get out of the water, Simon!

393
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:00,385
Shoot him!

394
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:01,985
Rudy, behind you!

395
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,938
Swim, Simon! Swim!

396
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,701
No! Liberty!

397
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,142
Shoot it!

398
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:45,184
What do you think I'm trying
to do, you fucking moron?

399
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:13,374
Come on.
Come on.

400
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:18,433
Fuck! You fucking zombie bastards!

401
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,502
You're not gonna fuck with us again,
are ya, asshole?

402
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,810
Are you? Are you?

403
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,600
- My face!
- You all right? Let me see.

404
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,872
Let me see.
Could I have your coat?

405
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,171
- Oh, fuck!
- Here, let me see it. Let me look.

406
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:40,862
Fuck!

407
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:43,835
- Let me see it.
- Are you a doctor?

408
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:46,462
- Hardly. He's premed.
- I'm in med school.

409
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:49,346
At least you're not pre-law.

410
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:53,148
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.

411
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,699
- Is that a bite?
- Yeah.

412
00:39:57,764 --> 00:40:00,153
- All right.
- Hmm?

413
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:03,391
I've gotta get back to the patrol boat.
I can get on the radio and get us help.

414
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,939
Wait. Are you just gonna leave us here
while you go looking for the cavalry?

415
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:09,629
- You're coming with me.
- Me? Why me?

416
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,284
Are you a doctor?
Are you wounded?

417
00:40:12,355 --> 00:40:14,656
- Can you use a gun?
- Well, I can...

418
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,632
That's why you.

419
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,561
The boat should be
a mile or so up the beach.

420
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:20,536
We'll climb aboard and come back
for help. Understood?

421
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,292
- Come on.
- Greg. My name's Greg.

422
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:25,184
Come on, Greg!

423
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:32,927
- Hey, what the hell were those things?
- I don't know.

424
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:37,183
But what I do know now is why
they call this island <i>Isle del Morte.</i>

425
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:40,064
You gotta do this.
You gotta do this.

426
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:42,910
There must be some kind
of scientific explanation for this.

427
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:47,418
Liberty's right.
They gotta be some kind of mutation.

428
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:51,798
Yeah, from what? The shrinking ozone?
What, too little sunscreen?

429
00:40:51,873 --> 00:40:54,523
Rudy, give me a break.
These are zombies pure and simple.

430
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:56,927
The sooner we accept it
and deal with it...

431
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:59,163
the better chance we have
of getting out of here alive.

432
00:41:02,303 --> 00:41:05,150
Your first mate seemed to know something
about this island. What was it?

433
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:08,729
- Nothing but an old wives' tale.
- Like the walking dead?

434
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,368
Well...

435
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:15,610
best I reckon,
the story goes...

436
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:20,375
<i>there was once some</i>
<i>crazy Spanish padre...</i>

437
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:22,301
<i>who was banished from Spain...</i>

438
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,700
<i>hundreds of years ago.</i>

439
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:27,254
<i>His name was Castillo Sermano.</i>

440
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:37,844
You asked to see me,
Father Castillo?

441
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,289
Come closer, Captain.
I cannot see your face.

442
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:59,153
Are you afraid, Captain?

443
00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:07,121
You know why
I was banished from Spain?

444
00:42:07,196 --> 00:42:10,163
Your experiments are not of God.

445
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,407
God?

446
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:16,304
What has God done for you,
or for me?

447
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,451
Nothing.

448
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:22,800
There is no God.
There's only me.

449
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,940
May he have mercy on your soul.

450
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:39,384
<i>The Spanish were trying from falling...</i>

451
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:41,937
<i>the sands into the limeys.</i>

452
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,563
They never made it to the garrison.

453
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:49,266
They say he murdered the crew
of the <i>St. Cristobol...</i>

454
00:42:49,337 --> 00:42:54,454
enslaved the natives of this island,
and killed whoever came here ever since.

455
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,040
Some say he still does.

456
00:42:57,112 --> 00:43:00,341
- I'm sorry I asked.
- If you ask me...

457
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:02,513
it's just a bunch
of smugglers and cutthroats...

458
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,438
looking for ways
to scare people off.

459
00:43:04,503 --> 00:43:06,892
Well, you would know,
wouldn't you?

460
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:08,910
What can I say?

461
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:12,049
They're doing a hell of a job,
ain't they?

462
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,575
What is it?

463
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:29,995
- I can't hear anything.
- Neither do I.

464
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,284
Run! Run!

465
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:51,910
We can't stay out here like this.
We're too vulnerable.

466
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,836
I know, but we can't leave
until Greg and Casper get back.

467
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:56,749
We gotta get back on that boat, but
there's no way I'm goin' in that water.

468
00:45:56,813 --> 00:46:00,074
We can't. It's too far. Besides,
we don't know what's still on that boat.

469
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,148
What about that house?

470
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,451
It's defensible.
We'll have shelter.

471
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:08,812
Okay, it's a good idea. We make a run
for it as soon as they get back.

472
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:10,763
What if they don't come back?
What then?

473
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:12,967
- They'll come back.
- Yeah, but what if they don't?

474
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,851
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any weapons or food.

475
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,436
- I mean, we don't have shit.
- Actually, we do.

476
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:33,320
- You gotta be kidding me.
- This is why Casper's on your ass?

477
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:36,169
- You're smuggling Cuban cigars?
- Among other things.

478
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:38,984
Still hard at work smuggling,
I see, Victor.

479
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,286
Don't you just wish
you could prove that, Jordan?

480
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:44,353
- What are these then?
- We just found them on the beach.

481
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,149
- Right.
- Crazy, huh?

482
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:48,487
I'm not gonna worry about that
right now. We've got bigger problems.

483
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:51,074
My patrol boat's been destroyed.
My first mate is missing.

484
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:53,993
- What about Greg? Where is he?
- Yeah.

485
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,200
I don't think he made it.

486
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:59,581
- What do you mean?
- He's gone. I'm sorry.

487
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:02,952
We gotta go back there and look for him.
Maybe there's a chance he's okay.

488
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:06,115
- We can't just leave him out there.
- He's dead.

489
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:09,698
If you don't wanna end up like him,
shut up and listen to what she's saying.

490
00:47:11,336 --> 00:47:13,987
What else you got in there
besides smokes? Anything useful?

491
00:47:15,016 --> 00:47:18,332
Let me introduce you
to my little friend.

492
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:29,892
And who said size doesn't matter?

493
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,860
Nice. But mine's bigger.

494
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,658
Mossberg 500.

495
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:38,174
Stainless shotgun
with incendiary shells.

496
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:40,253
Saving the best for last.

497
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:45,313
Here you go.
Take it.

498
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,751
Good choice.

499
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:54,880
Desert Eagle.
I like the way you think, girl.

500
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,430
We can't stay here for long.
Those creatures are everywhere.

501
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,890
We talked about making a run for it
to that house that we found.

502
00:48:00,966 --> 00:48:03,551
That sounds like a good idea. We can
hole up in there until help arrives.

503
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,050
If help arrives.

504
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:08,638
Don't worry. When we don't report in,
the marine patrol will come for us.

505
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:11,229
Everyone know how
to use their weapons?

506
00:48:51,074 --> 00:48:53,146
- Shit!
- We're gonna have to make a run for it.

507
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:55,105
- What if they're already inside?
- That's a chance we have to take.

508
00:48:55,171 --> 00:48:57,505
We can hold up a lot better
in there than we can out here.

509
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,260
- Once they spot us...
- Oh, God!

510
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,308
Over here!

511
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:31,112
- The door's locked!
- You gotta be kidding me!

512
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:35,042
We could blow the door. But there
won't be enough left to keep them out.

513
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:38,501
Forget it.
We'll find another way.

514
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,110
- We need more ammo!
- We haven't got any.

515
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,254
- I'm down to my last clip.
- Yeah, me too.

516
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:30,114
I'm saving mine for myself.

517
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:32,451
Are you okay?
Watch out!

518
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,722
- The window!
- Can you get through, Rudy?

519
00:56:43,493 --> 00:56:46,143
Yeah. Come on!

520
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:48,954
Oh, shit.

521
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:52,546
Die, you son of a bitch!

522
00:56:56,516 --> 00:56:58,883
Pull! Hurry!

523
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:16,449
Oh, my God!

524
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:20,605
Oh, my God!

525
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:23,489
Casper? Look at me.

526
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:25,888
Casper, look at me.
I need you to look at me.

527
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:28,288
Okay? Look at me.

528
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:32,216
Look at me.
You saved us, okay?

529
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,144
You saved us.

530
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,822
Shit, I'm out!

531
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:57,882
Fuck.

532
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,014
Let's get him to that table!

533
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:37,821
See if we can find something
to use as a bandage.

534
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:41,781
Simon, we should check
for more of them.

535
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:49,365
- Sorry.
- Where's Casper, Rudy?

536
00:58:49,436 --> 00:58:51,738
She didn't make it.
I'm sorry.

537
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:57,686
Okay.

538
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,546
Okay, Captain, this is gonna hurt.

539
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:10,230
Do it. Do it!

540
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,438
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

541
00:59:18,779 --> 00:59:21,234
- Give me a light.
- Here.

542
00:59:24,858 --> 00:59:28,153
Fuck. Oh, shit.

543
00:59:31,259 --> 00:59:32,819
Don't look at me.

544
00:59:39,546 --> 00:59:41,456
I'm the fuckin' Elephant Man.

545
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,040
- I think we should...
- Just get away from me.

546
00:59:49,112 --> 00:59:51,317
I don't need your help.

547
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:07,569
- Hang in there, Kirk.
- All right, all right, all right.

548
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:10,707
Just get some rest.

549
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:15,888
- Is he gonna end up like Cynthia?
- I don't know.

550
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:37,933
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

551
01:00:38,006 --> 01:00:41,454
- Does it matter?
- It does. It matters to me.

552
01:00:42,837 --> 01:00:45,292
I mean, are we even
gonna get out of here?

553
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:48,333
Even if we get out of here,
I'm finished.

554
01:00:48,406 --> 01:00:51,919
Who's gonna be able to look me
in the eyes with a face like this?

555
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,451
I'm a freak.
I belong in the fuckin' circus.

556
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,761
Don't talk like that.

557
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:59,026
I happen to think
you've been very brave tonight.

558
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:02,028
And I still think
you're pretty damn sexy.

559
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:13,070
You're not just doing this
to make me feel better, are you?

560
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,140
I'm doing this
to make me feel better.

561
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:28,586
It's so quiet.

562
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:30,514
Yeah, it's almost too quiet.

563
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,448
- Look at this.
- What?

564
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:37,736
Where are they dragging them?

565
01:01:37,811 --> 01:01:39,720
What are they doing
with the bodies?

566
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:41,867
I got a bad feeling.

567
01:01:48,178 --> 01:01:50,185
What happened?

568
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:53,705
- Rudy, what happened?
- Why does it matter what happened?

569
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:57,094
She's dead. I didn't save her.

570
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:59,176
- It's not your fault.
- It was my fault!

571
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:01,322
It was my fault!

572
01:02:01,393 --> 01:02:03,978
Were you here?
Did you see it?

573
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:06,635
Did you see...
watch them rip her apart?

574
01:02:12,689 --> 01:02:14,543
You know what?

575
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:17,893
You know what?

576
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,269
It's not gonna happen again.

577
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,533
We're gonna get out of here.

578
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:44,810
It's Kirk. You need to take a look
at him. He's getting worse.

579
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:47,651
Okay.

580
01:02:56,141 --> 01:02:58,508
How you doin', Captain?

581
01:02:58,573 --> 01:03:01,736
- I wouldn't mind a drink.
- Okay.

582
01:03:05,517 --> 01:03:07,372
That's all we got.

583
01:03:07,437 --> 01:03:12,488
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but thanks just the same.

584
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,981
Guys, check out this book.

585
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,620
It looks pretty old.
Maybe it'll help us.

586
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,343
Well, that cuts it.
I'm either gonna get better or I ain't.

587
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:38,601
In any case, you have no <i>agua,</i> a fistful
of ammo left and zero rations.

588
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:41,929
Maybe it's time
you stopped babysitting me...

589
01:03:41,995 --> 01:03:44,678
and started worrying about yourselves
a bit more.

590
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:48,226
- What'd you have in mind?
- Check out the rest of the house.

591
01:03:48,298 --> 01:03:52,160
See what you can scrounge and
where you can fortify yourselves better.

592
01:03:52,234 --> 01:03:55,495
There's no telling
what's coming through that door next.

593
01:03:57,514 --> 01:03:59,369
Maybe there's another way out of here.

594
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:02,568
You guys,
this looks like a ship's journal.

595
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:06,910
According to the officer's logs, it says
Castillo Sermano killed the captain...

596
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:09,374
then beached the ship
and lit it on fire.

597
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,003
So the stories that Kirk told us
make sense now.

598
01:04:12,074 --> 01:04:14,245
You'd better go now. Go.

599
01:04:15,305 --> 01:04:16,898
You're right.

600
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:20,735
- You gonna be okay?
- Just fine.

601
01:04:20,808 --> 01:04:24,125
If not, I've always got this.

602
01:04:27,176 --> 01:04:30,591
The captain's right. We gotta get out of
here and search the rest of this house.

603
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,112
Let's go.

604
01:04:43,943 --> 01:04:46,626
Let's start with the courtyard.

605
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,371
What is all this?

606
01:05:05,093 --> 01:05:08,160
What's in there?

607
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,269
- I can't...
- It's locked?

608
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:21,757
- What...
- Oh, my God.

609
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,075
This is sick!

610
01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:38,236
Sorry.
This is unbelievable.

611
01:05:40,323 --> 01:05:43,072
- Why aren't these zombies alive?
- I don't know.

612
01:06:15,073 --> 01:06:17,440
Rudy, take a look at this.

613
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:26,879
It's blood.

614
01:06:26,944 --> 01:06:28,537
It's blood?

615
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:31,797
Yeah, but...

616
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:33,728
it's not human, though.

617
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:36,312
It's like it's...
It's like it's been mutated.

618
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:40,248
I've never seen anything
like it before.

619
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,221
It's completely unnatural.

620
01:06:44,704 --> 01:06:46,711
It's fucking genius.

621
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:10,677
I'm not gonna let Salish
live like one of them.

622
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,690
Kirk, where are you?

623
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:34,832
What are you doing?
They're gonna kill you.

624
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:36,879
I'm dead already.

625
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:47,381
See you in hell, boys.

626
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:49,935
Everybody get down! Now!

627
01:08:58,071 --> 01:08:59,500
Get out of here! Everybody!

628
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:05,877
- We just need to...
- Lock the door!

629
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:07,535
Hurry, hurry!

630
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,596
What?

631
01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:18,546
- What is that?
- Son of a bitch! It's gunpowder.

632
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:21,745
Well, it's a good thing.
We can use it, right?

633
01:09:21,814 --> 01:09:24,148
The only way we can use it
is if we blew it up, and...

634
01:09:24,213 --> 01:09:27,311
No, it's useless, because
someone would have to be here to...

635
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:29,683
I'll go to the lab.
I'm gonna see if I can find something.

636
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,083
I'll go with you.

637
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:34,058
Let's see.

638
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,977
What is this?

639
01:09:46,452 --> 01:09:49,135
What happened?

640
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:51,851
Karma, no!

641
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:57,232
Oh, my God, it's the blood!
It brings 'em back to life!

642
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,111
Go!

643
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,273
Here!

644
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:11,822
Here, use this!

645
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,930
- Let's move this!
- Board it up with this!

646
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:18,378
They're breaking through!

647
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:20,943
Come on!

648
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,073
You guys, there's a door!

649
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,342
Get down! Go!

650
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,930
Simon, come on!

651
01:10:34,321 --> 01:10:35,914
Just go!

652
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:40,135
Shit!

653
01:11:30,254 --> 01:11:32,196
Where the hell are we?

654
01:11:32,269 --> 01:11:34,691
Must be some kind of catacomb
underneath the house.

655
01:11:36,813 --> 01:11:38,406
Sorry, Karma.

656
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:43,335
This must be how they shift supplies
from the ship to the house.

657
01:11:43,405 --> 01:11:47,332
If that's the case, then one of these
tunnels lead to the beach somewhere.

658
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:49,894
Let's go.

659
01:12:09,003 --> 01:12:10,596
I'm out.

660
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:29,795
- Have they gone?
- I hope so.

661
01:12:29,866 --> 01:12:31,589
Listen. Be quiet.

662
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,082
Let's go.

663
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:48,255
- Go! Go!
- Go, go, go, go!

664
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,408
- I'll take care of these guys.
- Karma, no!

665
01:13:04,871 --> 01:13:06,399
Get out of here! Hurry!

666
01:13:06,472 --> 01:13:07,965
Hurry!

667
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:54,106
- Greg, what are you doing here?
- What is this room?

668
01:13:58,084 --> 01:13:59,994
Greg, we thought you were dead.

669
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:08,320
Greg, say something.

670
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:17,690
Alicia, get away from him.
That's not Greg! Get away!

671
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:21,881
Get off me!

672
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:24,256
- Oh, God!
- What do they want with us?

673
01:14:24,323 --> 01:14:27,071
On the table.
On the table!

674
01:14:28,322 --> 01:14:30,711
Hold him down.
Hold him down!

675
01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:37,537
Your body parts...

676
01:14:37,602 --> 01:14:40,799
they will serve me well
for a long time.

677
01:14:40,866 --> 01:14:42,240
Beautiful.

678
01:14:42,305 --> 01:14:46,462
The blood we found,
it ties all the creatures.

679
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,977
You created it all so
you could be immortal. Why?

680
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:54,363
To live forever.

681
01:14:54,432 --> 01:14:56,766
It works.

682
01:14:56,832 --> 01:14:58,839
After all these years, it finally works.

683
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:02,295
The blood lives like I said it would.

684
01:15:02,368 --> 01:15:04,823
Fantastic.

685
01:15:04,896 --> 01:15:07,230
Did you hear what I said?

686
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:09,205
It works.

687
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,352
I'm going to live forever.

688
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,017
Forever.

689
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:23,864
I will never die.

690
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:26,804
You think you can kill me?

691
01:15:26,879 --> 01:15:29,017
I will live forever.

692
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,683
Forever!

693
01:15:54,205 --> 01:15:56,758
Your skin.

694
01:15:56,829 --> 01:15:59,196
So beautiful.

695
01:16:03,068 --> 01:16:05,305
I've been waiting for you...

696
01:16:05,372 --> 01:16:07,281
for a long time.

697
01:16:08,893 --> 01:16:11,348
What do you want?

698
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:15,479
I just want your flesh.

699
01:16:30,843 --> 01:16:34,454
Run! Come on!

700
01:16:56,665 --> 01:16:59,153
- Fuck, that was close!
- I can't believe what just happened!

701
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:04,913
Isn't it nice to know
someone wants you for your body?

702
01:17:04,985 --> 01:17:06,228
Yeah.

703
01:17:06,296 --> 01:17:08,597
Depending on what they want.

704
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,630
We gotta get to the beach.
Come on.

705
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:52,910
Fucker!

706
01:17:58,293 --> 01:17:59,819
Fuck you!

707
01:19:20,432 --> 01:19:23,116
Game over, fucker.

708
01:19:33,264 --> 01:19:34,856
Oh, my God.

709
01:20:41,707 --> 01:20:44,293
Maintain perimeter.
"G" and I are proceeding inside.

710
01:20:44,363 --> 01:20:48,072
Advise of any contact with reanimated
Homo sapiens. Maintain alpha alert.

711
01:20:52,522 --> 01:20:55,304
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

712
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:58,599
We're here to rescue you.

713
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:01,416
- Thanks.
- Is she okay?

714
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:03,751
Does she look okay?

715
01:21:08,457 --> 01:21:10,366
What's your name?

716
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:13,192
Rudolph.

717
01:21:13,257 --> 01:21:15,166
You got a last name?

718
01:21:17,065 --> 01:21:18,658
Curien.

719
01:21:20,232 --> 01:21:23,975
<i>I feel guilty</i>
<i>because of what happened.</i>

720
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:25,895
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

721
01:21:25,961 --> 01:21:29,189
<i>So many dead,</i>
<i>so many victims...</i>

722
01:21:29,256 --> 01:21:31,744
<i>and people that were my friends.</i>

723
01:21:31,816 --> 01:21:34,718
<i>And now we go home...</i>
<i>me and Alicia.</i>

724
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:38,469
<i>Or whatever she is now,</i>
<i>whatever I've created.</i>

725
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:40,925
<i>God, ain't love a bitch?</i>

726
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,611
<i>Is this the end,</i>
<i>or only the beginning?</i>
