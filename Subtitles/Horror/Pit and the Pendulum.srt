IS HEAVY IN HERE.               

141
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,048

153
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:01,736
I DID IT ALL FOR HER.           

154
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,971
 I WANTED HER TO HAVE

159
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,170

        YOU MEANT TO TELL ME?   

162
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,947
YOU ARE AN UNYIELDING MAN,      
MR. BARNARD.                    

163
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,916
        I AM FORCED TO BE, SIR. 

164
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,518
GOD AS MY WITNESS,              
I WORSHIPPED YOUR SISTER.       

165
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,120
 I WORSHIP HER STILL.           

166
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,390
WITHOUT HER,                    
LIFE IS MEANINGLESS.            

167
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:42,660
SHE WAS THE VERY SUBSTANCE      
OF LOVELINESS.                  

168
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:49,300
I TRIED TO CAPTURE IT,          

169
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,970
BUT IT WAS THE WAY              
SHE WALKED AND MOVED...         

170
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,272
HER SMILE, HER VOICE.           

171
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,409
SHE SANG LIKE AN ANGEL.         

172
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,445
AND SHE COULD PLAY              
THE HARPSICHORD                 

173
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,214
AS NO OTHER WOMAN I HAVE        
EVER KNOWN COULD PLAY.          

174
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:08,885
EVERY NIGHT                     
AFTER WE HAD DINED...           

175
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:13,090
SHE WOULD PLAY FOR ME.          

176
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,626
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.              

177
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:21,165
I HAD NOT INTENDED              
TO SO DISPLAY MYSELF.           

178
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:24,401
 I ONLY WANTED                  
 TO CONVINCE YOU.               

179
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,370

180
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,106
BEG OF YOU TO                   
LEAVE ME FOR A WHILE.           

181
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:33,810
PLEASE, GO.                     

182

A LITTLE OVER A WEEK.

238
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,542
            I DIDN'T WANT       
            HIM TO KNOW.        

239
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,610
        KNOW WHAT?              

240
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:24,648
YOUR SISTER'S DEATH             

241
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,650
WAS CAUSED BY FAILURE           
OF THE HEART, SIR,              

242
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:27,952
DUE TO TOTAL SHOCK.             

243
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,821
LITERALLY,                      
SHE DIED OF FRIGHT.             

244
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,689
            WHY DID YOU         
            NOT TELL ME?        

245
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,825
I THOUGHT                       
TO SPARE YOU, SIR.              

246
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,326
            YOU THOUGHT         
            TO DECEIVE ME!      

247
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,527
        THAT'S NOT TRUE.        

248
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:38,545
WHAT IS ALL THIS?               

249
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,531
                SHOW ME WHERE   
                IT HAPPENED.    

250
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,734
VERY WELL.                      

251
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,902
        NO, NICHOLAS.           

252
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,070
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY,           
MY DEAR.                        

253
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,972
WE WERE WRONG...                

254
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,810
VERY WRONG TO HAVE KEPT         
THE TRUTH FROM MR. BARNARD.     

255
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,013
NOW WE ARE DOUBLY               
SUSPECT IN HIS EYES.            

256
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,564
        SUSPECT?                

257
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,566
COME.                           

258
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:04,905
NICHOLAS, YOU SHOULD NOT        
BE DOING THIS, YOU KNOW.        

259
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,439
YOU'RE NOT WELL.                

260
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:09,810
        IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED,   
        CHARLES.                

261
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,912
        COME.                   

262
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,877
                WELL?           

263
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,466
        Francis:                
        A TORTURE CHAMBER?      

264
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,801
            YES, MR. BARNARD.   

265
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,603
            IT WAS MY FATHER'S. 

266
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,605
    SEBASTIAN MEDINA.           

267
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,408
    ONE OF THE INQUISITION'S    
    MOST INFAMOUS DEGRADED--    

268
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:15,609
PLEASE, SIR.                    
THAT IS ENOUGH.                 

269
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,843
    MR. BARNARD,                
    CAN YOU NOT SEE--           

270
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,345
        WHAT WAS MY SISTER      
        DOING HERE?             

271
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,683
SHE COULD NOT                   
KEEP HERSELF AWAY.              

272
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:41,335
        THAT NOISE I HEARD.     
        IS THAT WHAT WAS--      

273
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,437
            NO, SIR. THAT       
            PARTICULAR DEVICE   

274
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:45,306
            WAS NOT IN OPERATION
            AT THE TIME.        

275
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:46,307
        WHICH DEVICE?           

276
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:48,676
            IT'S IN AN ADJOINING
            CHAMBER DOWN THERE. 

277
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,979
    PLEASE, MR. BARNARD,        
    DO NOT GO THERE. I...       

278
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,815
        I DO NOT WISH           
        TO DISCUSS IT.          

279
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,651
                THE STORY, SIR. 

280
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,152
                IN DETAIL.      

281
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:05,192
    THIS WAS MY FATHER'S WORLD, 
        MR. BARNARD.            

282
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,260
SPARE YOURSELF                  
AT LEAST THIS, NICHOLAS.        

283
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,663
        HOW CAN I SPARE MYSELF? 

284
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,165
            WAS HE NOT          
            MY FATHER?          

285
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,068
            AM I NOT THE SPAWN  
            OF HIS...           

286
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,204
            HIS DEPRAVED BLOOD. 

287
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:20,474
HIS DEPRAVITY                   
IS NOT YOURS, NICHOLAS.         

288
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,509
WHY SCOURGE YOURSELF            
BECAUSE OF IT?                  

289
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,111
    YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED ME,   
    DON MEDINA.                 

290
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,915
        I SHALL NOT DWELL UPON  
        THE HISTORY OF THIS...  

291
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:32,152
        THIS BLASPHEMOUS        
        CHAMBER.                

292
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,556
SUFFICE IT THAT THE BLOOD       
OF A THOUSAND MEN AND WOMEN     

293
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:38,392
WAS SPILLED                     
WITHIN THESE WALLS.             

294
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,961
LIMBS TWISTED                   
AND BROKEN!                     

295
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,464
EYES GOUGED                     
FROM BLOODY SOCKETS,            

296
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,131
FLESH BURNED BLACK.             

297
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,700
        WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME  
        THESE THINGS?           

298
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,402
        WHAT HAVE THEY TO DO    
        WITH MY SISTER?         

299
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,538
I SHOULD NEVER                  
HAVE BROUGHT HER HERE.          

300
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:55,058
SHE WAS TOO SENSITIVE,          
TOO AWARE.                      

301
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,227
        AWARE OF WHAT?          

302
00:19:57,294 --> 00:20:01,098
THE MALIGNANT ATMOSPHERE        
OF THIS CASTLE.                 

303
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,033
IT DESTROYED HER.               

304
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,936
        MY SISTER WAS A STRONG  
        AND WILLFUL WOMAN,      

305
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,504
        NOT SUBJECT             
        TO THE INFLUENCE        

306
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:08,772
        OF ATMOSPHERES.         

307
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,544
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE ONLY         
A MATTER OF HOURS, MR. BARNARD. 

308
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:17,948
 YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT IT IS     
 TO LIVE HERE...                

309
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,952
MONTH UPON MONTH,               
YEAR AFTER YEAR...              

310
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,388
BREATHING THIS INFERNAL AIR,    

311
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:28,191
ABSORBING THE MIASMA            
OF BARBARITY                    

312
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,360
WHICH PERMEATES THESE WALLS,    

313
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,313
PARTICULARLY THIS CHAMBER,      

314
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:36,683
BUT IT DID NOT BOTHER HER       
AT FIRST, EITHER.               

315
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:40,454
OUR LIFE WAS GOOD...            

316
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:44,023
RICH WITH THE SHARED            
PLEASURES OF OUR LOVE.          

317
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,049
    Nicholas: EACH MORNING      
    I WOULD BRING HER BREAKFAST.

318
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,887
    IN THE AFTERNOONS,          

319
00:20:56,954 --> 00:21:00,824
    SHE USUALLY SAT FOR ME      
WHILE I ATTEMPTED ALL IN VAIN   

320
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,161
    TO CAPTURE HER BEAUTY       
        ON CANVAS.              

321
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,430
    I DID THAT PORTRAIT WHICH   
    YOU SAW IN HER ROOM BEFORE, 

322
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:11,334
    BUT IT IS ALL INADEQUATE    
TO RECALL THE LOVELINESS OF HER.

323
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:19,142
    WE DINED, SOMETIMES ALONE,  
ENJOYING INTIMATE CONVERSATION, 

324
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,745
    SOMETIMES WITH THE DOCTOR.  

325
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,513
[PLAYING HARPSICHORD]           

326
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:27,217
        AND EVERY NIGHT,        
    ELIZABETH WOULD PLAY FOR ME.

327
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:36,593
    LIFE WAS SIMPLE, QUIET,     
    RICHLY PLEASURABLE,         

328
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,930
    AND THEN THE DARKNESS       
        BEGAN TO FALL.          

329
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:45,635
    MORE AND MORE, ENTERING     
    HER ROOM IN THE MORNINGS,   

330
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:47,170
    I WOULD FIND HER AWAKE      

331
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:49,973
    AND DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD   
    NOT SLEPT ALL THE NIGHT.    

332
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,875
    I TRIED TO FIND OUT WHY,    

333
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,077
    BUT SHE HAD NO EXPLANATION. 

334
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,414
    HER APPETITE BEGAN TO FADE. 

335
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:00,683
        SHE BEGAN TO LOSE       
        WEIGHT AND COLOR.       

336
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,385
    I TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT,    

337
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:05,521
        BUT SOMETHING           
        KEPT HER FROM IT.       

338
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,025
    I WOULD COME UPON HER       

339
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,594
    WANDERING IN THE CORRIDORS  
            AT NIGHT.           

340
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,764
    I TRIED TO FIND OUT         
    WHAT WAS WRONG,             

341
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,132
    BUT SHE NEVER HAD AN ANSWER,

342
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:19,736
    EXCEPT TO SAY THAT SOMETHING
        WAS OPPRESSING HER.     

343
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,905
        OH, GOD, HELP ME        
        FOR MY BLINDNESS.       

344
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,706
    I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.          

345
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,578
    THEN ONE DAY                
    SHE DISAPPEARED.            

346
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:31,748
    FRANTIC, I SEARCHED         
    THE CASTLE FOR HER.         

347
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:43,710
        AND THEN I KNEW.        

348
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:47,497
THE CASTLE AND ITS AWFUL HISTORY
        HAD OBSESSED HER.       

349
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,234
        THESE VERY              
    INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE,     

350
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,887
    WHICH WERE MY BIRTHRIGHT    
        AND MY CURSE,           

351
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,840
    NOW TORMENTED HER AS WELL,  

352
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,376
    INFECTING HER WITH A KIND   
    OF HAUNTED FASCINATION.     

353
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:03,630
    I WATCHED HER DRAWN TO ONE  
        AND THEN ANOTHER        

354
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:07,734
    AS IF THE AURA OF PAIN AND  
SUFFERING WHICH SURROUNDED THEM 

355
00:23:07,802 --> 00:23:11,271
    WAS LURING HER TO SICKNESS  

356
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,774
        AND TO DEATH.           

357
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:21,481
IMMEDIATELY, I MADE MY PLANS    
TO LEAVE THE CASTLE WITH HER.   

358
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:24,418
    WE WOULD TRAVEL FOR A WHILE,
        RESTORE HER SPIRITS,    

359
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:26,853
    AND THEN MAKE OUR HOME      
        ELSEWHERE.              

360
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,390
    THEN ON THE VERY EVE        
    OF OUR DEPARTURE...         

361
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,191

362
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,961

            FROM BELOW,         

363
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,898
    THE MOST HIDEOUS            
    BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAM       

364
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,033
        I HAVE EVER HEARD       
            IN MY LIFE.         

365
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,240
    JUST BEFORE SHE DIED,       
    SHE WHISPERED A NAME.       

366
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,974
        SEBASTIAN.              

367

                SEBASTIAN.      

369
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,711
MR. BARNARD.                    

370
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,045
                    DO헤.       

371
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:27,447
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?           

372
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:29,382
                YES, OF COURSE. 

373
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,184

                YOUR BROTHER?

IS STAYING WITH HIM.            

376
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,525
I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU          

377
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:40,893
TO PLEASE BELIEVE HIM,          
MR. BARNARD.                    

378
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,895
HE HAS TOLD YOU                 
THE TRUTH.                      

379
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,700
                HAS HE?         

380
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,167
    YES.                        

381
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:49,602
IN NOT TELLING YOU              
BEFORE,                         

382
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,904
HE ONLY MEANT                   
TO SPARE YOU PAIN.              

383
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,709
HE IS A GOOD MAN,               
MR. BARNARD,                    

384
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:58,177
A KIND AND GENTLE MAN,          

385
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,247
AND I KNOW THAT                 
HE ADORED YOUR SISTER.          

386
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:10,523
I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE HIM,    
DO헤 MEDINA,                    

387
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:13,860
BUT I FIND IT                   
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO.        

388
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:17,630
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM     
I CANNOT HELP BUT SENSE,        

389
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:21,901
A KIND OF FEARFUL               
TENSION THAT--                  

390
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,103
I'M SORRY...                    

391
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,172
BUT AN AIR                      
OF DEFINITE GUILT.              

392
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,860
        OF COURSE HE SUFFERS    
        FROM GUILT, MR. BARNARD,

393
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:32,562
        BECAUSE OF              
        WHAT OUR FATHER DID,    

394
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,799
         BECAUSE OF WHAT        
         HAPPENED TO ELIZABETH. 

395
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,835
            PERHAPS IT WILL HELP
            YOU TO UNDERSTAND   

396
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,503
            IF I TELL YOU       
            SOMETHING           

397
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:41,972
            THAT HAPPENED       
            TO NICHOLAS         

398
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,974
            WHEN HE WAS         
            JUST A BOY.         

399
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:48,511
            ONE DAY, WHILE      
            NICHOLAS WAS PLAYING

400
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:50,247
            IN THE LOWER        
            CORRIDOR...         

401
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,586
    Catherine: HE HAD BEEN      
    FORBIDDEN BY OUR FATHER     

402
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:59,089
    TO ENTER THIS CHAMBER       
        AT ANY TIME.            

403
00:26:00,257 --> 00:26:02,642
    THE CURIOSITY OF YOUTH,     
            HOWEVER,            

404
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,280
OVERCAME HIS FEAR OF CHALLENGING
    OUR FATHER'S DISCIPLINE.    

405
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:09,382
    HE HAD TO SEE THE CHAMBER.  

406
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,178
        SUDDENLY,               
    THERE WERE FOOTSTEPS.       

407
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:04,353
    IT WAS OUR FATHER.          

408
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:08,324
    WITH HIM WERE OUR MOTHER    
    AND OUR UNCLE BARTOLOME,    

409
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,093
        WHO WAS                 
    OUR FATHER'S BROTHER.       

410
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:45,662
    AT FIRST, IT APPEARED THAT  
    FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON

411
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,832
    OUR FATHER WAS ACTUALLY     
        CONDUCTING THEM         

412
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,735
        ON A TOUR               
    OF HIS GHASTLY CHAMBER.     

413
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:57,174
    NICHOLAS COULD SEE THAT     
BOTH OUR MOTHER AND OUR UNCLE   

414
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,576
    WERE UNEASY, FRIGHTENED.    

415
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:03,279
        OUR FATHER'S            
    SMILING AFFABILITY          

416
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:06,549
    AS HE DESCRIBED THE WORKINGS
    OF THESE HELLISH INSTRUMENTS

417
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,753
    TURNED NICHOLAS' BLOOD COLD.

418
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:13,656
    HE WATCHED THEM WITH        
A MOUNTING SENSE OF PREMONITION.

419
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:18,394
    SOMETHING WAS WRONG,        
    MOST TERRIBLY WRONG.        

420
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:21,198
    EVEN HE, NO MORE            
    THAN 10 YEARS OF AGE,       

421
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:24,434
    COULD SENSE IT LIKE         
A DARKENING VAPOR IN THE AIR.   

422
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,203
    THERE WAS NO REASON         

423
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,739
    FOR OUR MOTHER AND OUR UNCLE
        TO HAVE BEEN THERE.     

424
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,524
            AAH!                

425
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:32,925
    Catherine: AS HE STRUCK,    

426
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:36,863
    HE KEPT ON SCREAMING        
    AT HIS BROTHER ONE WORD     

427
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,731
        OVER AND OVER--         

428
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,335
    "ADULTERER! ADULTERER!"     

429
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,804
    AND THEN HE TURNED ON HER.  

430
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:45,922
            AAH!                

431
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,842

    OF VILE DEBAUCHERIES        

432
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,178
    WITH HIS BROTHER,           

433
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:53,180
    CURSING HER AS FAITHLESS,   

434
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,182
        PROMISING HER           
    THE AGONIES OF HELL         

435
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:57,834
        AND PAYMENT             
    FOR HER INFIDELITY,         

436
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:02,371
         AND THERE BEFORE       
     MY BROTHER'S VERY EYES,    

437
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,125
        OUR MOTHER              
    WAS TORTURED TO DEATH.      

438
00:29:11,231 --> 00:29:13,166
            EVER SINCE THEN,    

439

        TO LIVE AS OTHER MEN.   

440

        ALWAYS, HE IS HAUNTED   
        BY THE MEMORY           

441
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:20,907
        OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY.

        CAME VERY CLOSE

        HAVE TO SEE HER.        

477
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:56,873
        I KNOW HER PLAYING.

00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,079
        IS THERE ANOTHER DOOR?  

482
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:21,881
THERE IS NOT, SIR.

00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,165

                STAY, PLEASE?

00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:55,407
            MY DEAR LORD.       

495
00:34:55,475 --> 00:34:57,509
                    IT IS HERS, 
                    ISN'T IT?   

496
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:58,878
            IT IS.              

497
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:00,279
                    BUT HOW?    

498
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,981
        LET US NOT TALK HERE.   

499
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:03,783
        MAY WE USE              
        YOUR ROOM, SIR?         

500
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,818
YES, OF COURSE.

                SIT.            

502
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:22,935
    WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU 

503
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:26,605
    NO ONE IN THIS WORLD EXCEPT 
    NICHOLAS AND MYSELF KNOWS.  

504
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:31,377
        THAT IS, I THOUGHT THAT 
        NO ONE ELSE KNEW.       

505
00:35:31,444 --> 00:35:32,879
            TAKE THIS.          

506
00:35:32,946 --> 00:35:33,980
    NO.                         

507
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:35,614
            DRINK IT.           

508
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,904
        TO BE ABSOLUTELY        
        BLUNT ABOUT IT,         

509
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:43,773
        NICHOLAS BELIEVES       
        THAT ELIZABETH          

510
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,443
        MAY HAVE BEEN           
        INTERRED PREMATURELY.   

511
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:48,645
            WHAT?               

512
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,413
                I HASTEN TO     
                ASSURE YOU BOTH 

513
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,381
                THAT SUCH       
                IS NOT THE CASE.

514
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:54,183
                ELIZABETH       
                WAS QUITE DEAD. 

515
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:56,218
                I WOULD STAKE   
                MY REPUTATION   

516
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:57,219
            ON THAT FACT.       

517
00:35:57,287 --> 00:35:58,721
                    THEN WHY--  

518
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,657
        DOES HE BELIEVE IT?     

519
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,191
        BECAUSE OF WHAT         
        HAPPENED TO HIS MOTHER  

520
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,225
        MANY YEARS AGO.         

521
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:06,395
            I'M AFRAID          
            I DON'T UNDERSTAND. 

522
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,599
I TOLD MR. BARNARD              
WHAT NICHOLAS SAW THAT DAY.     

523
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,067
            NO, MY DEAR.        

524
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:13,603
            YOUR MOTHER WAS NOT 
            TORTURED TO DEATH   

525
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,972
            AS YOU WERE TOLD.   

526
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,173
    BUT--                       

527
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,609
            SHE WAS TORTURED,   
            YES...              

528
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,478
            BUT NOT TO DEATH.   

529
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:23,813
            DO I MAKE           
            MYSELF CLEAR?       

530
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,782
DO YOU MEAN                     
TO SAY THAT--                   

531
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,151
        YOUR MOTHER WAS         
        WALLED UP IN HER TOMB...

532
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,120
            WHILE YET ALIVE.    

533
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,355
    OH, NO.                     

534
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,360
        FROM THAT DAY FORTH,    

535
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:40,463
        THE VERY THOUGHT        
        OF PREMATURE INTERMENT  

536
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,697
        WAS ENOUGH              
        TO DRIVE YOUR BROTHER   

537
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:44,233
        INTO CONVULSIONS        
        OF HORROR.              

538
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:47,670
    NICHOLAS BROODS ABOUT IT    
        CONSTANTLY.             

539
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,005
    ALREADY HE HAS TOLD ME      

540
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:52,442
    HE HAS HEARD ELIZABETH      
    WALKING THE CORRIDORS,      

541
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:55,578
    EVEN THAT HE HAS HEARD      
    HER SPEAKING HIS NAME.      

542
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:56,596
                DR. LEON.       

543
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:57,863
SIR?                            

544
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,600
        YOU SEEM TO FORGET      
        THAT WE ALL             

545
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:02,468
        HEARD THE HARPSICHORD   
        PLAYING.                

546
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,670
NO, I HAVE NOT                  
FORGOTTEN IT, SIR.              

547
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:08,107
IT IS WHY I SAID BEFORE         
THAT I THOUGHT                  

548
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:10,476
THAT NO ONE BUT NICHOLAS        
AND MYSELF KNEW ABOUT THIS.     

549
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:11,644
            WHAT DO YOU MEAN?   

550
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:14,813
SOMEONE, I FEAR, HAS            
DISCOVERED NICHOLAS' SECRET     

551
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,750
AND IS USING IT                 
AS A TERRIBLE ADVANTAGE.        

552
00:37:17,817 --> 00:37:19,385
A SERVANT, PERHAPS.             

553
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:23,422
    I COULD ALMOST              
    MORE EASILY BELIEVE THAT--  

554
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:28,994
        THAT WHAT, DO헤 MEDINA? 

555
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:31,029
    NOTHING.                    

556
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:33,232
I SPOKE                         
WITHOUT THOUGHT.                

557
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:40,156
            I WANT TO KNOW      
            ONE THING, SIR.     

558
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:44,042
        ARE YOU                 
        ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE...  

559
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,945
        THAT DON MEDINA'S       
        DREAD IS UNWARRANTED?   

560
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,147
            IF ELIZABETH MEDINA 

561
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:50,316
            WALKS THE CORRIDORS 
            OF THIS CASTLE,     

562
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:53,870
            IT IS HER SPIRIT,   
            NOT HER LIVING SELF.

563
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:09,685
[WOMAN SCREAMING]               

564

565
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,072
ELIZABETH'S ROOM.               

566
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:16,925
                    AAH!

                HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:43,068
                I HEARD HER.

575
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,642
             I WAS CLEANING UP  
             THE ROOM,          

576
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,710
            AND SHE SPOKE TO ME.

577
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,747
            SHE CALLED ME       
            BY MY NAME--MARIA.  

578
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:58,184
             SHE SAID, "MARIA,  
             LEAVE THIS ROOM!"  

579
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:02,688
                MY WIFE         
                SPOKE TO YOU?

582
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:21,707
    NO ONE WILL EVER            
    ENTER THAT ROOM AGAIN.
