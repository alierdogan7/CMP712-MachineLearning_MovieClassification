00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,805
Could the lesson not be
yours to learn, Rebekah?

180
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,356
Didn't you damn one
of them to eternity,

181
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:29,609
viciously antagonize the other?

182
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,196
Those lunatics actually
believe the prophecy.

183
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,397
You don't, do you?

184
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,648
You'd be foolish to ignore

185
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,066
the manifestation
of these omens.

186
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,818
We can't be killed, Elijah.

187
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,870
This prophecy does state one
of us will fall by family.

188
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:42,320
Well, I would never harm you,

189
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,157
you killed half the Navy
rescuing me,

190
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,292
Freya hates traitors.

191
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,161
Yes. Freya. Let's not forget
her allegiance to Finn.

192
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,329
I do want to trust her, but...

193
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,166
So that leaves Nik.

194
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,500
Do you think he's
learned his lesson

195
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,636
about backstabbing his family?

196
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,422
Oh, I think he learns
that lesson all the time.

197
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,756
He's just a terrible student.

198
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,179
Do you ever want to
just rip out his heart

199
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,847
and see how long
it takes to grow back?

200
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,768
Unh! Ohh.

201
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:16,938
What is it?

202
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,658
Marvelous.

203
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,360
What do you get the girl
who has everything this Christmas?

204
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,696
A cure to a magical mark
growing on her bloody arm.

I'm armed.

Aah! Aah!

210
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,912

It's Cami.

216
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:12,256
I assume you called first.

217
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:13,424
I've been told turning up

218
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:14,725
at someone's home uninvited

219
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:15,760
could be considered rude.

220
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:17,595
Are you seriously following me?

221
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,263
Klaus, I don't need a bodyguard

222
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:22,099
or some white night
trying to protect me.

223
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,267
I'm here as your friend.

Oh, my God! Will! No!

230
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,039
Camille!

231
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,840
Will: You shouldn't
have come here!

232
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:48,291
Will, it's gonna be ok.

233
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,460
Just drop the gun.

Insert empathetic

235

It's not ok!

236
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,963
Put the gun down!

237
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,183
Or what, you'll
save me the bullet?

238
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,602
I am the definition
of worthless!

239
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:01,722
I try and try to
make a difference,

240
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:05,643
but there are things lurking
out there in the shadows,

241
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:07,528
and... And in the face of them,
I am nothing.

242
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,064
Do you understand?

243
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,149
It's Lucien's compulsion.

244
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,201
Is there anything
you can do, Klaus? Please.

245
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,988
Invite me in.

246
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:25,329
Hey! I got your text.

247
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,330
What happened?

248
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,630
She got jumped.

249
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,750
3 vampires all dressed
like yuppies.

250
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:30,835
The Strix.

251
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,502
Yeah. She needs your blood.

252
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,341
You ok?

253
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,726
Kind of hard to
ignore it when someone

254
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,260
needs your help, huh?

255
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:44,515
They took it.

256
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:46,734
The serratura.

257
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:48,568
I was meeting with a witch

258
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,020
from the bloodline
who built the lock.

259
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,772
I was hoping she could
help me destroy it,

260
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:53,574
but it's not possible.

261
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,693
She said the only way
to get rid of it

262
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:57,161
is to use it.

263
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:59,446
We have to get it back
and lock something else away,

264
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,665
anything but my family.

265
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,367
Great. Why don't
we pay Tristan a visit

266
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:06,202
and ask him
really, really nicely?

267
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:12,009
I'm afraid we have
a far more urgent problem.

268
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,011
Well, to be fair,
I am the prettiest

269

you have ever seen.

this gym for warriors.

271
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:25,272
You're not welcome anymore.

mom went after Davina...

00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,730
He can't put food on
the table for his sisters.

00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:36,283
Life's a bitch in the ninth.
What else is new?

277
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:39,069
Today, Tristan transferred
50 gs into Van's account.

278
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,907
Tonight, Van will ascend
to the regency.

279
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:45,576
The leader of
the witches will be some kid

280
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:48,629
with a debt to The Strix.

281
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,748
Meanwhile, you're here,

282
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:51,999
fighting shadows.

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,334
Marcel, you got no idea
what I fight.

284
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:01,475
Wow.

285
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,093
Whatever it is,
it's gonna be a lot worse

286
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:05,145
when you have the blood
of your people on your hands,

287
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,765
all because you sat back
and let it happen.

288
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,934
Since when have you given
a damn about my people?

289
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:11,769
I'm New Orleans born and bred.

290
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,320
So are you.

291
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,605
Yeah, witches and vampires

292
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:15,773
have been fighting for power

293
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:16,941
since this city was a swamp,

294
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,859
but we are all New Orleans,

295
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,779
and now you're gonna hand
over 9 powerful covens

296
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,914
to some outsider!

297
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:24,949
Witch business ain't
your business.

298
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,617
I think you should back off.

299
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,370
Or what? You gonna get
another little teenage girl

300
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,371
to do your dirty work?

301
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,767
Hoo.

302
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:48,138
I have been holding back
my power for a long time.

303
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:49,974
Today that stops.

304
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,642
See, I came here for
a little bit of clarity,

305
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:53,477
and I think I just got that.

306
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,980
I'm gonna take back
the regency, Marcel,

307
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:58,731
but you ain't gonna like
what I'm gonna do with it.

308
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,880
While I cannot take away
the feelings of worthlessness

309
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,832
that haunt you now,
I can tell you

310
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,835
you will learn
to live with them.

311
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,837
I certainly have.

312
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,922
I have also come to find

313
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:25,059
that the very thing you
believe is worth the least

314
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,478
matters most of all.

315
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,731
There is beauty in the courage

316
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:34,068
of the fragile fighter,

317
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,520
those who persevere

318
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,822
despite all they've
been through,

319
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:43,026
those who still believe
there is good in the world.

320
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:49,533
Us dark things
often find we need

321
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,534
that light the most.

322
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:57,091
What you do not see in yourself

323
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,959
others see in you.

324
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,462
You do matter.

325
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:13,273
Have you a family?

326
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:16,026
Yeah, a sister.
Baton Rouge.

327
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:19,062
Go to her.
Enjoy Christmas.

328
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:22,066
In the new year,
you will return to your captain,

329
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,736
and he will welcome
you with open arms,

330
00:16:25,737 --> 00:16:28,539
and, detective,

331
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,911
you will remember today
as your darkest day.

332
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:38,132
Tomorrow will be better,

333
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,452
the day after better still.

334
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,420
You will go on.

335
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,182
Give me the bad news, doc.

336
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:56,650
Freya: Aya's stake was cursed.

337
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,102
It infected you.

338
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:01,739
As this mark grows,
you will go mad.

339
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,774
Left unchecked, you will become

340
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:06,994
a relentless,
unstoppable ripper.

341
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:08,946
Aya always was thorough.

342
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,447
Strix always employ a safeguard.

343
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,582
In the event
that we were successful

344
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,168
at retrieving your body,
you were cursed.

345
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:16,620
You see, if one is on a rampage,

346
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,955
one is not difficult to hunt.

347
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:20,624
Can you fix this?

348
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,292
The spell is carved here.

349
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:25,212
I can... I can reverse it.

350
00:17:25,213 --> 00:17:28,465
I just... Need some time

351
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:31,134
and a hell of a lot of magic.

352
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:41,144
Jackson: She was fine.
Hayley healed her.

353
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,816
This scratch is not healed.

354
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:48,202
This is poison.

355
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:51,649
This is an assassination
attempt.

356
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:01,640
She's waking up.

357
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,394
You ok?

358
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,897
I feel weak.

359
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:12,235
Jackson: Those vampires must
have stabbed her with something.

360
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,370
So The Strix are fond of
this slow-acting poison.

361
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,205
There is an antidote.

362
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:17,989
If I can get my hands on it.

363
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:23,162
For this, I'll need
a pure silver knife,

364
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,248
some white muskroot.

365
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:26,332
I'll get the knife.

366
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,334
I'll track down the root.

367
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,303
Freya, you can barely
float a feather right now,

368
00:18:30,304 --> 00:18:32,505
let alone save the world.

369
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,756
I'll channel Finn.

370
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:36,008
Oh, lovely.

371
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,059
My fate rests in the hands

372
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,177
of our black sheep of a brother

373
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,179
that we have trapped
in a necklace.

374
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,681
I'm sure he's just
leaping to help.

375
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:44,350
Well, he's the only other
powerful witch here,

376
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,602
and you and I are out of options,
sister.

377
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,864
He's packing.

378
00:18:57,865 --> 00:18:59,582
Klaus...

379
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,582
What you did...

380
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,869
Was nothing.

381
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,455
It was not nothing.

382
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:09,291
[Cell phone vibrates]

383

[Chanting]

386
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:31,314
Finn: The pain you
endure for these monsters

387
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,648
you call family.

388
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,233
Finn.

389
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,702
It isn't worth it, sister.

390
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:40,406
It is.
It has to be.

391
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:42,742
The ingredients are complicated.

392
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,076
Klaus: I don't need the recipe.

393
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:45,628
I know exactly where I
can find the antidote.

394
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:48,080
I'll be quick.

395
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,582
If The Strix have been using
this poison for centuries,

396
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,418
then Lucien has a cure,
I guarantee it.

397
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,753
Probably keeps it tucked away

398
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:55,587
next to his cure
for werewolf bites.

399
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,924
I'm sure he won't mind if
we break in and borrow it.

400
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:01,677
You go.
I'll be fine.

401
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,479
No.

402
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,764
If I'm going to save my sisters,

403
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:07,767
I can't be worried about you.

404
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:11,938
Right now,
the safest place for you is with me.

405
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,271
Please.

406
00:20:16,026 --> 00:20:19,779
[Hope crying]

407
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,782
Don't fret.
I haven't gone full hellion yet.

408
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:24,282
No more than usual.

409
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:25,751
Well, that's good.
I wouldn't want to

410
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:28,838
have to kick your ass
before I got to hug you.

411
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:31,123
You know, we need to talk
about your sartorial choices.

412
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:33,376
This is positively darling.

413
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,795
That is not mine.
That is Cami's.

414
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,964
She has been staying
here the past few nights.

415
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:41,634
Actually, Jackson and I
have our own place now,

416
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:46,138
although we still can't manage
to stay out of Mikaelson drama.

417
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,807
You don't seem to mind
the family drama

418
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,692
when you need something from us,

419
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:53,311
like a decent dress
or a babysitter.

420
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:54,814
Excuse me?

421
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:56,399
But when you're looking
for someone to blame

422

for your unhappiness,

423
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:00,903
we seem to be the enemy.

424
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,906
Rebekah, you're wrong.

425
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:05,574
This... This isn't you.

426
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:07,376
I am wrong.

427
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:09,829
I believed we were friends,

428
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,330
nearly sisters,

429
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,665
but the last time we spoke,

430
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,000
you were planning
on taking hope away

431
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,167
from this family forever,

432
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,720
so where do you stand, Hayley?

433
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:20,389
Are you a friend,

434
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,426
are you family,

435
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:26,012
or perhaps...

[Gags, coughs]

You are dying for her.

441

Let Rebekah go.

442
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,357
Let them all go.

443
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:46,525
Uh-uh.

444
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:47,776
It will just be
the two of us again.

445
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:49,594
I will save her.

to you, brother, help me.

you in the process.

Be honest. You want
Klaus dead, don't you?

Rebekah, I have been
busting my ass,

trying to fight this prophecy

463
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,907
at the expense of my own family.

Ha ha! You mean
that fake husband

you've been parading
around in front of Elijah?

Do you know the agony
it causes him?
