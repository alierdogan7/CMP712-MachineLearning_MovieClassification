I love Christmas!

There, I said it.

I don't care who knows it 'cause

48
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,963

Before he went all hippy with
the sandals and long hair.

What?

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,610
No no, no, no no,
Susan, I'm gonna

53
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,489
talk about Jesus on the radio.

54
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,131
You know why?

55
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,282
Because it's his birthday
tomorrow, am I right, folks?

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
Speaking of
reminders, it's almost

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,884
time for the big
charity food drive

58
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,249
at the mall this afternoon.

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,369
Our very own
weatherman of action,

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,363
Stormin' Norman is gonna be

61
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,124
down there helping out like the

62
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,929
true Christmas angel he is.

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,970
Norman, is there any
truth to the rumor

64
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,202
that a very special
guest is gonna

65
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,090
be making an appearance
at the food drive?

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,366
Norman?

67
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,043
Hmm, oh, hey Norman,

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,727
he's writing me a
little Christmas card.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,161
This is exciting.

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,686
What's it gonna say?

71
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,361
Wow, Norman.

72
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,726
Susan, did you see that?

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,245
You know who saw that?

74
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,885
Jesus saw that!

75
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,768
And his dad. He saw that.

76
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,130
All right folks, looks like...

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,206
Norman's hitting the trail,

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,725
so we'll just get this

79
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,167
Christmas party
started without him!

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,001
Yes, sir!

81
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,970
We're gonna share the spirit.

82
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,643
We're gonna deck some halls!

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,768
I'm gonna get Susan
under the mistletoe

84
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,047
and you, my little elves,

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,281
you're gonna listen to one of

86
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,885
my favorite songs.

87
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,168
So here's to the season!

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,930
Here's to you, Bailey Downs.

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,682
<i>Favorite time
of year is here</i>

90
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,687

party started right.

Girlfriend's late.

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,802
Impossible, we use protection.

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,641
Made the mistake of watching

96
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,960
this alone last night,

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,771
but nobody can know
I have this, okay?

98
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,726

105
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,610
<i>A lot of blood in here.</i>

106

107

Voiceover: Oh, boy.

109
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,563
<i>Scott". Body showing signs

110
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,165

<i>Got some writing on
the wall over here.</i>

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,920
<i>"For unto us a child is born.</i>

115
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,441
<i>Unto us a son is given."</i>

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,166

117
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,890

Christ!

127
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,521
Okay, why was that
cop singing that song?

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,201
No one knows, he went

129
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
on stress leave after this

130
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,251
and doesn't talk about it.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,204
Okay, and you still wanna go

132
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,441
down there just for some

133
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,521
stupid school assignment?

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,409
Man up, Dylan.

135
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,210
We obviously can't
use the police video,

136
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,409
so we have to get
our own footage.

137
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,211
Hey, babies.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,041
You're late, bitch.

139
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,929
Sorry, dad pulled
this family trip

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,809
out of his ass an hour ago.

141
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,811
Merry Christmas.

142
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,124
It'll get you through
any door in the school.

143
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,851
I love you so much right now.

144
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,127
Wow Caprice, I can't
believe you actually got them.

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,041
That's my honey.

146
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,610
Stickiest fingers
in Bailey Downs.

147
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,007
Gotta go.

148
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,480
Don't get busted.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,729
Taylor: Come on,
we got a long drive.

150
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,284
Christmas Eve and you wanna

151
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,283
drive to see your old aunt who,

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,203
as far as I know,
doesn't even like you.

153
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,611
She doesn't like anyone.

154
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,569
Okay, fine, but you're
dragging us along with you.

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,721
You know what, and I expect

156
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,802
everyone to be on
their best behavior.

157
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,449
Okay, we're not in Saint
Barth's for Christmas,

158
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,488
that's fine, or even
Aspen, that's--

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,961
Okay, look, I just wanted
to have some bonding time.

160
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,282
You hear that, I want this

161
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,203
to be a happy, loving family.

162
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,009
So you want a
Christmas miracle.

163
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,087
Scott: All right,
son, let's get that tree.

164
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,165
It's cold out here, huh?

165
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,330
Will: I want the
new Morph Machine.

166
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,129
The Morph Machine
with the motorcycle

167
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,043
and the guy has a green vest.

168
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,770
Not the blue one, the other guy

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,245
with the Morph Machine.

170
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,087
You Okay?

171
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,330
We can go back if you want.

172
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,842
- I’m okay.
-He'll be fine, he'll be fine.

173
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,927
Not here.

174
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,771
What do you mean not here?

175
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,810
Baby, look at those, huh?

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,687
Tell me you will find the
perfect Christmas tree.

177
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,886
Look, we can go
right through here.

178
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,645
Great, nice example
for a cop, Scott.

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,846
We're in the
middle of nowhere.

180
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,604
No one's gonna even
know we're here.

181
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,401
Go on.

182
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,241
Come on!

183
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,451
Right behind you, son.

184
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,610
Come on, don't be scared.

185
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,120
Dylan:
Quit groping her,

186
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,611
let's get on with it.

187
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,886
Thanks.

188
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,129
Five, four, three...

189
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,281
Christmas, usually a time of joy

190
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,409
and celebration, but for
Saint Joseph's Academy,

191
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,970
a time of mourning.

192
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,162
Exactly one year ago
last Christmas Eve

193
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,810
this school was the scene of an

194
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,564
unimaginable crime when two

195
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,927
of its students,
Connor and Jenna,

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,846
seen here, were found
murdered in cold blood.

197
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,640
With the killer still at large,

198
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,250
the atmosphere here
in Bailey Downs

199
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,687
is truly grim this
holiday season.

200
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,683
I'm Molly Simon, and this
is <i>Horror</i> in the Hallways.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,889
- Dylan: Wait, cut.
-What?

202
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,281
Are we really going
with that cheesy title?

203
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,090
Your opinion would mean
a lot more to me if you

204
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,241
weren't failing Media Arts.

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,441
Shh shh shh, hold on guys,

206
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,885
I think I hear something.

207
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,127
Harod: I'm fine!

208
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,201
Shit.

209
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,201
It's Principal Harod.

210
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,163
We just need to be careful.

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,121
Yes, I...

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,841
I know!
Listen to me!

213
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,401
Go, go, go, 90!

214
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,891
No, not that one, the other one.

215
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,600
Molly, hurry UP-

216
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,761
Wait.

217
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,087
Never mind, now
I'm getting jumpy.

218
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,326
Molly: Principal Harod.

219
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,607
Dylan: What the hell is he
doing here on Christmas Eve?

220
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,841
Molly: Keep it down!

221
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,367
Great.

222
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,846
Ben: I've got flashlights.

223
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,927
Oh, nice.

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,684
Come on, it's this way.

225
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,926
Diane: Wow!

226
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,084
She better remember
us in the will.

227
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,124
It's about time she
invited us here.

228
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,291
She did invite us, right?

229
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,362
Think of it as a
Christmas surprise.

230
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,681
- Taylor!
-What, 'its the season.

231
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,167
She'll be thrilled.

232
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,485
Mmmmm

233
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,884
You see, the thing is...

234
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,207
To be honest, Aunt Etta,
I know you

235
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,449
and mom had
difficulties and I just

236
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,046
thought we could
get it out there

237
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,241
and deal with it.

238
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,731
Dear, maybe now's
not a good time.

239
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,531
It's Christmas, what
could be a better time?

240
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,410
Christmas is all
about forgiveness

241
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,767
and family and tradition.

242
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,571
If you just believe, if you let

243
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,927
that spirit in, it fills you.

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,411
Don't touch that!

245
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,122
It's very old.

246
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,161
Is there some
place more private

247
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,401
you and I could talk, I wanna

248
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,487
show you something I think

249
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,164
you might be interested in.

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,081
Come.

251
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,246
Four hours in the car and the

252
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,209
old bat doesn't even
offer me a drink.

253
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,170
I'll help myself, thank you.

254
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,126
Look at this place, it's like

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,964
Paul Bunyan and
Count Dracula gayed up

256
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,565
and built a dream home.

257
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,130
That is not a toy.

258
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,045
Oh, hi there, we're the--

259
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,610
I know who you are.

260
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,881
Okay.

261
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,885
This is Krampus, right?

262
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,241
What's a Krampus?

263
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,970
He's like an anti-Santa Claus,

264
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,122
a demon who punishes
the naughty.

265
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,805
He whips them, chains them up,

266
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,087
throws them in a
sack, stuff like that.

267
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,730
When Krampus knocked,

268
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,484
the demon hunts the wicked

269
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,961
from sunset to sunrise.

270
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,726
That's fun.

271
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,761
He comes for little boys who

272
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,569
touch things they shouldn't.

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,401
Oops.

274
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,081
Duncan!

275
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,926
That was very unwise.

276
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,891
We will pay for it
of course, pick it up.

277
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,164
Gerhart, what have you done?

278
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,571
Gerhart: I did nothing.

279
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
The boy had...

280
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,001
An unfortunate accident.

281
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,522
Take your family
and leave now.

282
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,840
Taylor: Let's
not be hasty here.

283
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,081
Etta: No, my son, I feel

284
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,404
one of my spells coming
and I cannot entertain guests.

285
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,966
Good bye.

286
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,361
Bicycle parts to Sector Five!

287
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,841
Organs sets to arrive!

288
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,371
Video games...

289
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,564
Get out of the way,
get out of the way!

290
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,371
Have to take it
out again this year.

291
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,329
Ho ho ho!

292
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,051
Talk to the Mrs., Sparkles.

293
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,610
Santa, I need your signature.

294
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,044
Thank you.

295
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,328
So what are we up against
this year, Jingles?

296
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,641
Blizzard warning along
the Eastern seaboard.

297
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,768
Never met a blizzard
that troubled me.

298
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,161
Jingles:
It's bad, it's really bad.

299
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,207
Another signature here.

300
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,406
Jingles: I'm worried
about the trade winds.

301
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,447
Trade winds.

302
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,601
Jingles: Safety first, Santa.

303
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,091
Right
here on the left.

304
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,321
Lots of kids are depending

305
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,004
on tonight going
off without a hitch.

306
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,321
Shiny?

307
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,286
Take a break, everyone!

308
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,805
Voiceover: Yay, Mrs. Claus!

309
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,962
Even Christmas magic
needs a little fuel.

310
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,443
- Oh ho, cookies!
-Smells good.

311
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,681
Cookies!

312
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,011
Have a cookie, Shiny.

313
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,526
No, I...

314
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,006
I don't know.

315
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,091
No thank you.

316
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,083
It'll keep your strength
up for the long shift.

317
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,605
I'm not hungry.

318
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,171
Voiceover: Not hungry?

319
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,482
- They're cookies!
-You're being silly, Shiny,

320
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,449
you know how much
you love my cookies.

321
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,167
I said I don't want
a goddamn cookie!

322
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,050
You reindeer fucking snow whore!

323
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,925
Martha: Shiny!

324
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,607
He...

325
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,130
He's dead.

326
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,721
Dead?

327
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,041
But elves--

328
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,326
Jingles: Can't die.

329
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,926
Santa, elves can't die, right?

330
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,841
No.

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,885
They cannot.

332
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,291
Scott: Yeah, he's gonna help

333
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,486
his pop put this up too.

334
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,641
Will: This tree is way

335
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,290
better than the
ones at the mall.

336
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,566
Scott: We did it.

337
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,769
Stop, we can't do this again.

338
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,205
Oh, no way.

339
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,005
They won't even miss it.

340
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,090
Woman:

341
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,160
Scott: Look at this,
babe, this is a perfect tree.

342
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,651
Smells like pine, you love pine.

343
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,085
Yeah yeah yeah, I don't think

344
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,650
it's gonna fit up the stairs.

345
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,529
Of course it will,
it'll be fine, trust me.

346
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,327
Where's Will?

347
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,931
He was right here with us.

348
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,247
Will?

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,323
- Will?
-Will!

350
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,969
- Woman: Baby!
-Come on, we gotta go!

351
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,451
This ain't time to
play hide and seek now!

352
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,806
Where are you, babe?!

353
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,406
We gotta go, come on, son!

354
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,766
Will!

355
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,524
Come on, boy, stop
playing, we gotta go!

356
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,681
Where are you, baby?!

357
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,761
Mom?!

358
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,929
- Come on, honey, let's go!
-William, where are you?!

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,126
Dad!

360
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,641
William!

361
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,960
Where are you?!

362
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,841
Will!

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,161
Where'd he go?

364
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,406
Couldn't have gone far.

365
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,684
- Over here.
-Oh, God.

366
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,161
Will!

367
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,887
Baby?!

368
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,769
This way, through here.

369
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,601
Son!

370
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,241
Will!

371
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,361
Will!

372
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,767
Will!

373
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,846
William!

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,126
Woman: Will!

375
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,681
Oh God.

376
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,527
Will!

377
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,801
Will?!

378
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,960
Come here, buddy!

379
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,841
Scott!

380
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,841
Will.

381
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,246
Will!

382
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,245
Will, are you okay?

383
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,402
What the hell happened?
Why'd you take off like that?

384
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,527
Why?

385
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,406
Don't yell at him!

386
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,050
It was your idea
to come out here!

387
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,569
Oh, boy, real palace
of fun down here.

388
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,202
Saint Joseph's
used to be a convent

389
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,884
a long time ago, this is part

390
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,610
of the original building.

391
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,526
Dylan: You could be
a bride of Christ too,

392
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,967
Molly, you've got the whole
virgin thing going on.

393
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,451
Actually, this
is where they kept

394
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,966
the unmarried girls
who got pregnant.

395
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,887
It was a big deal back then

396
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,166
if they weren't married, you had

397
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,651
to keep them out of sight.

398
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,000
Didn't they shut this place
down before it became a school?

399
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,201
Yeah, yeah, there were a lot

400
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,009
of weird stories going around

401
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,287
like this 15 year
old girl claimed

402
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,089
she was a virgin, said it was

403
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,487
a miracle like the
Virgin Mary, but...

404
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,486
No one believed her.

405
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,571
So what happened to her?

406
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,526
Don't you know, Ben?

407
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,761
- It was your mom.
-No, actually, she died

408
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,808
trying to abort her baby.

409
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,201
Let's go.

410
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,200
This is it.

411
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,809
This is where Connor
and Jenna were killed.

412
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,891
Are you getting this?

413
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,565
Ben: You guys hear that?

414
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,761
Dylan: What?

415
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,721
Stay focused.

416
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,163
- This is where--
-We know. We saw the video.

417
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,289
Molly: I wanna make sure
I don't forget anything.

418
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,562
- Yeah?
-Yeah. Let's see.

419
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,244
Stick to the
camera light, Dylan.

420
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,321
Words aren't really your thing.

421
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,481
I just wanna make sure

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,449
there's no more
horror in the hallways.

423
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,566
You Okay?

424
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,766
What's wrong?

425
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,286
Ben: Nothing.

426
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,130
Five minutes.

427
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,566
You guys couldn't act like a

428
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,847
normal goddamn family
for five minutes.

429
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,882
I think we're pretty normal

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,331
compared to those two.

431
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,329
That creep deliberately
baited Duncan.

432
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,971
Sweetheart,
it wasn't your fault.

433
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,401
I don't know why
your aunt got so

434
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,006
mad over some stupid
piece of.

435
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,521
She wasn't mad.

436
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,241
She was scared.

437
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,966
I can't believe
you dragged us here

438
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,326
on Christmas Eve
so that you could

439
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,402
hustle your own aunt,
that is a new low,

440
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,760
Taylor, even for you.

441
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,808
It's not a hustle,
the Bioplex is a

442
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,086
means of integrating technology

443
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,208
into a sustainable
future where--

444
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,291
Scientific innovation
is a shared experience.

445
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,203
Fine, yeah, it's
all good when it

446
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,601
pays for the house
and the vacations

447
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,728
and the school and
the orthodontist,

448
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,883
but, oh, otherwise,
no, it's a big joke!

449
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,321
Come on!

450
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,490
Come on, come on.

451
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,890
Damn, damn, damn!

452
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,847
Seriously?

453
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,244
I'm standing at the very spot

454
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,890
where Connor was found crucified

455
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,930
exactly one year ago
today on Christmas Eve.

456
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,490
Connor's neck was broken.

457
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,607
Over here, Jenna's
mutilated body

458
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
was found hanging off

459
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,923
some metal piping
in the ceiling.

460
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,761
Why would somebody
go to so much effort?

461
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,684
That is just one of the many

462
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,445
unanswered questions
in this baffling case.

463
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,407
How's it look?

464
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,081
You guys...

465
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,086
It's still here.

466
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,968
Unto us a child is born.

467
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,763
Unto us a son is given.

468
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,284
That's fucking creepy.

469
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,682
It's from Isaiah, Chapter 9,

470
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,604
Verse 6 about the
birth of Jesus.

471
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,081
Okay, this place
is creeping me out.

472
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,887
I think we've got
everything we need, let's go.

473
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,964
Yeah, won't argue
with you there.

474
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,481
What the hell?

475
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,007
What's wrong?

476
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,806
What the fuck?

477
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,927
I could've sworn
it was this one.

478
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,809
Molly, come on, hurry up.

479
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,687
Move.

480
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,606
I tried them all three times,

481
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,966
none of them fit.

482
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,687
Crap.

483
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,161
Okay.

484
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,449
Hello?

485
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,011
Principal Harod!

486
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,601
Principal Harod?

487
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,966
Hello?

488
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,731
Principal Harod!

489
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,481
Fuck!

490
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,449
Of course now he isn't around.

491
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,960
Can't see anything.

492
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,610
I've got full bars
and some service,

493
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,011
it should be ringing.

494
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,080
Guys, what if Principal
Harod locked us in?

495
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,605
Why would he do that?

496
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,282
For all we know, he
could be down here with us.

497
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,691
I got nothing, too.

498
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,206
Come on, baby.

499
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,131
Smile.

500
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,011
Will, you okay?

501
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,050
Come on, sport,
don't just sit there.

502
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,281
Look like you've never seen

503
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,486
a Christmas tree before,

504
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,891
why don't you help your
old man, all right?

505
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,011
I like that one.

506
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,691
<i>Okay, I’ll do it.</i>

507
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,970
Right there.

508
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,206
I wasn't around much
last Christmas, I know.

509
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,089
This year we're
having fun, right?

510
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,766
Slow down, Will.

511
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,687
Looks like someone's
worked up an appetite.

512
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,650
That's his second serving.

513
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,766
It must be good.

514
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,244
It's making me
hungry, let's eat.

515
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,847
You're eating too fast,

516
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,490
you're gonna get a tummy ache.

517
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,280
Hey.

518
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,809
Will, you hear your
mother talking to you?

519
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,486
All right, I think
that's enough.

520
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,605
Damn it!
What the fuck?

521
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,806
Scott, no!

522
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,286
I'll handle it.

523
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,441
Yeah, you handle it.
What's wrong with that kid?

524
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,131
Why'd you do that?

525
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,681
Answer me!

526
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,444
Go to your room right now!

527
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,688
Christmas, the most
magical time of year,

528
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,641
but in Bailey Downs this
Christmas, it's different.

529
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,406
It's gotta be.

530
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,003
It's true, my friends,
and you know it is.

531
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,647
Before I put another
jingle in your stocking,

532
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,131
I want you to think about

533
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,329
the little ones in
your life and give

534
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,561
a thought to the little ones

535
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,449
who aren't with us anymore.

536
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,691
Yeah, this next one's for them.

537
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,081
<i>For Jenna.</i>

538
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,086
For Connor.

539
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,328
From Saint Joseph's Academy

540
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,404
taken from us last year cruelly.

541
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,365
I know they're listening.

542
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,010
Somewhere out there.

543
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,290
Martha, thank God!

544
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,321
What's going on?

545
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,724
It's the elves,
I fear they may

546
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,211
all become infected.

547
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,801
Martha: Infected?

548
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,600
What do you mean?

549
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,881
Others are sick?

550
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,485
It's worse than that.

551
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,967
What happened?

552
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,769
Shiny's body is gone.

553
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,290
He was laid to rest, but now it

554
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,169
may already be too late.

555
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,329
But this doesn't
make any sense.

556
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,642
Elves becoming
the walking dead?

557
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,927
No, it does not make any sense.

558
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,207
Unless he is behind it.

559
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,965
Stand back, Martha!

560
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,971
You need to hide!

561
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,203
Open up, you fat
fucking piece of shit!

562
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,403
Here's Shiny!

563
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,410
Shiny risen from the dead!

564
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,369
Quick, go, hide!

565
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,522
Where's my fucking cookie?!

566
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,967
Stay back, Jingles!

567
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,526
Yeah, yeah, I got you,
you cocksucker!

568
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,323
Motherfucker, oh shit!

569
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,449
I didn't find any
windows without bars.

570
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,926
Same here.

571
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,885
Guys, I can't be
here, I'm supposed

572
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,121
to be at the mall helping

573
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,890
with the food drive or
mom's gonna kill me.

574
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,122
We've all got places to be,
it's Christmas Eve, bro.

575
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,362
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

576
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,046
Oh God.

577
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,885
A little jumpy, Dylan?

578
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,442
Oh, this is a nativity scene.

579
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,929
The school didn't
put it up this year.

580
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,207
Molly: You can't
openly display

581
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,361
a nativity scene anymore.

582
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,329
It's the war on Christmas.

583
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,571
Damn it, more bars.

584
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,089
Fuck, it's freezing down here.

585
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,241
Dylan: I can hear it.

586
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,965
Damn thing is on.

587
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,320
It won't...

588
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,281
Heat up.

589
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,045
Look, if we just sit around

590
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,610
and wait it out, I'm sure that

591
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,806
somebody is gonna notice.

592
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,211
Only Caprice knows
we're down here

593
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,566
and she's out of town.

594
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,847
The school's not gonna reopen

595
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,046
for another week and a half.

596
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,282
Look, if there was ever a time

597
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,124
to notice three missing kids,

598
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,601
tonight would be it, right?

599
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,724
We always open one gift.

600
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,970
Every Christmas Eve.

601
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,728
We eat pizza with champagne.

602
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,809
Watch The Sound of Music.

603
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,124
Before we go to bed...

604
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,808
We each open one gift.

605
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,286
Not this year.

606
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,850
Hell of a Christmas, huh?

607
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey.

608
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,529
It's not pizza and
champagne, but...

609
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,326
Merry Christmas.

610
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,886
Thanks, Dylan.

611
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,362
I didn't realize
how starving I am.

612
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,446
Yeah.

613
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,570
What if he comes back?

614
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,721
Who?

615
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,050
The guy who killed
Jenna and Connor,

616
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,531
what if he comes back tonight,

617
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,523
I mean we're trapped down here.

618
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,168
There's a psychopath
on the loose.

619
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,811
Psycho's already here.

620
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,889
Principal Harod,
I'm sure he locked

621
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,849
the door on us, who
else could it be?

622
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,803
I get that he's creepy, okay,

623
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,087
but that doesn't
mean he's a killer.

624
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,241
Then what's he doing here?

625
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,731
On Christmas Eve?

626
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,006
What makes matters
worse, I gotta piss.

627
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,569
I'm sure Joe won't mind...

628
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,331
If I borrow this.

629
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,291
Where's this...?

630
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,520
Caprice will know something's

631
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,409
up when Dylan doesn't
call her tonight.

632
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,929
Ugh, what is
that fucking smell?

633
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,091
Do you hear that?

634
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,006
What is it?

635
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,046
What is it?

636
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,486
I don't know.

637
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,361
It stopped.

638
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,690
Ben: Molly, Molly!

639
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,726
Dylan: What's going on?

640
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,207
Ben: I don't know what. She started
kicking and twitching!

641
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,327
Dylan: Molly!

642
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,846
Will!

643
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,121
Get out!

644
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,367
Hey.

645
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,961
Hey.

646
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,481
How's your hand?

647
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,247
Scott: I'll live.

648
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,121
Have you noticed Will hasn't

649
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,440
had to use his inhaler?

650
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,681
Really?

651
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,211
That's a good thing, right?

652
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,606
Yeah.

653
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,602
Something seems wrong.

654
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,490
Maybe we should take
him to the doctor?

655
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,766
Scott: The doctor?

656
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,490
On Christmas Eve?

657
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,564
Maybe we should just
keep an eye on him.

658
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,806
Come here.

659
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,400
You know, they
say you're allowed

660
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,727
to open one gift
before Christmas.

661
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,361
Scott...

662
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,205
Not right now.

663
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,882
All right, I just figured,
you know, it's...

664
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,080
It's been awhile.

665
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,801
Kim: With what's going on?

666
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,121
Scott: What's going on with me?
What are you saying?

667
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,407
Kim: I mean with Will.
The way he's been acting.

668
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,447
Scott: Yeah, sure, whatever.

669
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,170
You know what, forget it.

670
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,601
No, wait.

671
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,686
<i>Dan". Yes!
"Dangerous" Dan!</i>

672
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,690
<i>Let's listen to this
Christmas classic.</i>

673
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,720
<i>Silent night</i>

674
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,803
<i>Holy night</i>

675
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,248
<i>All is calm</i>

676
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,403
<i>All is bright</i>

677
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,364
Diane: We should
have stayed on the road.

678
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,883
Didn't exactly wear my "trudging
through the woods" boots.

679
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,240
Taylor: Look, this
will help us shave

680
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,924
a half hour off our
walk back to Etta's,

681
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,126
plus I gave you all the option

682
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,611
of staying in the car.

683
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,205
Caprice: Yeah, where mom
and I would be easy prey

684
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,442
for drunk hillbilly
rapists, no thanks, Dad.

685
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,205
Duncan: We
should make weapons.

686
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,361
Caprice: What?

687
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,487
Duncan: In case
whatever dad nearly hit

688
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,403
comes and hunts us,
the sun has set,

689
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,405
it is officially Krampusnacht,
the night of Krampus.

690
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,127
Son, that Krampus is a
load of old German bull--

691
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,767
Dad!

692
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,962
Oh, my God, what happened?

693
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,124
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!

694
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,811
Am I shot?

695
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,206
I don't know!

696
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,326
Oh, my God.

697
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,970
Duncan, get back here!

698
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,481
Duncan!

699
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,121
' Got it!

700
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,568
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Duncan!

701
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,563
Duncan!

702
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,886
Duncan!

703
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,486
Duncan!

704
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,810
Duncan, where are you?

705
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,971
Duncan!

706
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,441
Answer me!

707
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,447
Duncan?

708
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,966
Duncan?

709
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,081
Duncan?!

710
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,521
Oh, my God!

711
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,647
Where is he?

712
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,609
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

713
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,926
We need the police.

714
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,684
Mom, there's no
service out here.

715
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,241
What is that?!

716
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,321
Come on.

717
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,604
Run!

718
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,606
We have to run.

719
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,841
Duncan?

720
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,967
Sparkles!

721
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,161
Sparkles!

722
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,404
I'm gonna eat
your fucking brains

723
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,562
out, you Christmas cunt.

724
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,046
FUCK you!

725
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,886
I'll break that fucking staff

726
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,167
in your rosy-cheeked
ass, you fucker!

727
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,651
I'm sorry, Shiny.

728
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,209
I know it isn't your fault.

729
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,441
You don't have the
Christmas balls, you--

730
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,162
Bailey Downs,
it's getting close there

731
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,765
and we're counting
down to Christmas

732
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,127
and "Dangerous" Dan is pulling

733
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,009
his annual double shift to stay

734
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,889
with you until the end.

735
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,561
What?

736
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,001
What, we're...

737
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,850
Okay, well we're gonna check in

738
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,410
with good ol' Stormin' Norman

739
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,244
down at the charity food drive.

740
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,040
Hey Norman!

741
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,450
Normey, you're a little
scratchy there, buddy.

742
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,684
What, I did press
the button, Susan,

743
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,524
why don't you press
your own button?

744
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,046
Ahhh!

745
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,051
Sorry, folks, looks
like we got some of

746
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,168
those winter weather
technical difficulties,

747
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,607
too many reindeer
in the atmosphere.

748
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,287
That's my bet, so let's throw

749
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,169
another eggnog on the fire.

750
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,284
No wait a minute,
let's throw another log

751
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,246
on the fire and pour
yourself another eggnog.

752
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,929
You know, get some
good Christmas vibes.

753
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,645
Out to Susan who is seriously

754
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,166
harshing my buzz right now.

755
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,811
And listen to this
holly jolly classic.

756
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,566
Little shit.

757
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,607
Will.

758
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,526
Will!

759
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,846
Will, where are you?

760
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,600
Hey, whoa, what is it?

761
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,727
Where is he?

762
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,041
Huh?

763
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,681
Where is he, Will!

764
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,441
There you are.

765
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,726
Baby, don't, don't!

766
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,410
Did you open those presents?

767
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,086
Did you?

768
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,488
- Say something!
-Scott!

769
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,281
You think this is a game?

770
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,521
What are you doing?!

771
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,691
Say something.

772
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,968
Look at him, think it's
all one big fucking joke!

773
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,565
- Scott!
-You think this is funny?

774
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,971
- No!
-Move!

775
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,530
No, no, no!

776
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,122
Don't! Stop!

777
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,645
I knew this would happen!

778
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,802
You refused to see a doctor,
you said you could handle it!

779
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,881
'ZZZ

780
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,486
Did you not see what he did?!

781
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,641
Get out!

782
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,360
Will, you all right?

783
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,926
Hello?

784
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,889
Man: <i>ls this
the Peters household?</i>

785
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,250
Yes.

786
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,801
Man: <i>Got yourself</i> a
<i>nice Christmas tree, did you?</i>

787
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,286
Who is this?

788
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,402
You don't know
me, just consider

789
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,448
me a concerned neighbor.

790
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,041
<i>You were on my land,
took one of my trees,</i>

791
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,128
<i>and I saw your license plate.</i>

792
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,520
What do you want?

793
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,326
Your boy, how is he?

794
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,607
Did something happen
to him in the grove?

795
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,891
Look, I don't know--

796
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,407
Man: <i>I said, did something
happen to your boy.</i>

797
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,330
He got lost,
but we found him later.

798
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,806
No, you didn't.

799
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,771
He's still lost.

800
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,286
<i>Now we haven't got much time,</i>

801
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,169
<i>so you're gonna
have to do as I say.</i>

802
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,761
Bring the changeling back

803
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,525
to the forest
where you lost your son.

804
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,246
Changeling?

805
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,040
What the hell is that?

806
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,360
An animal.

807
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,651
That ain't your son.

808
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,087
Don't call again.

809
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,650
<i>Man: Wait, wait!</i>

810
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,081
Huh?

811
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,561
Molly?

812
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,601
We were worried about you.

813
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,800
What is it?

814
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,123
- You okay?
-Just come.

815
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,284
I have to show you something.

816
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,766
Should I wake Ben?

817
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,131
Where are you going?

818
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,406
Molly?

819
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,761
Okay.

820
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,765
You kidding me?

821
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,807
Molly.

822
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,647
Wait.

823
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,526
You're serious?

824
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,770
Whoa, okay.

825
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,888
Molly, Molly, Molly,
Molly, whoa.

826
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,165
Hey, this isn't gonna happen,

827
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,890
Molly, I have a girlfriend.

828
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,969
I think you're in
shock or something.

829
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,681
Will?

830
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,727
Will?

831
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,045
Will, is that you?

832
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,762
I shouldn't have lost my
head like that, I'm sorry.

833
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,082
Dad's just been a
little stressed lately.

834
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,201
But I'm trying.

835
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,285
I'm trying to be better.

836
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,047
Scott?

837
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,686
Hurry!

838
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,801
Hurry!

839
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,009
Get in, in, in!

840
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,721
Pull him here, get him here.

841
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,922
- Okay, shh!
-Okay.

842
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,484
Do you think that
you could walk?

843
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,644
We have to find Duncan.

844
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,482
I can go, I can go.

845
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,891
Dad, no you can't.

846
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,164
Mom, we have to stay here,
something's still out there.

847
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,368
He is out there by himself.

848
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,842
Mom, what if it
really is Krampus?

849
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,765
We have to stay in this
church until sunrise.

850
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,888
That is insane, let's go.

851
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,486
Yeah it is.

852
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,801
Church, church, we
have to confess our sins.

853
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,441
I'm not gonna make
it to sunrise,

854
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,329
I've lost too much blood.

855
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,724
We have to get past that thing.

856
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,765
They say it comes
for the wicked.

857
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,325
Maybe if we confess in a church,

858
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,846
we can absolve
ourselves of our sins.

859
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,010
Diane: That is ridiculous.

860
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,921
I stole this.

861
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,127
Diane: You what?

862
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,731
From Aunt Etta's.

863
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,401
I don't know why, I
can't really help myself.

864
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,331
But honest, I'm not as bad as

865
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,050
those other kids
with the sex and

866
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,929
the drugs and the cutting and...

867
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,731
Mom, I don't do that.

868
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,770
I just steal stuff.

869
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,326
Stupid stuff.

870
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,360
I'm sorry.

871
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,883
Even if this is
that Krampus thing,

872
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,371
none of this is
gonna help, okay,

873
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,649
that monster took Duncan
and Duncan was innocent.

874
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,451
No he wasn't.

875
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,168
What do you think
happened to all our pets?

876
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,971
I'm going out there myself.

877
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,051
Mom, the day
our cat disappeared

878
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,487
I found Duncan in the
garage with a garbage bag.

879
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,329
He had blood all over his hands.

880
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,123
- He was smiling.
-No! No!

881
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,685
This is your fault!

882
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,168
If you had just spent more
time with him, but all

883
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,561
you care about is your
stupid precious business--

884
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,290
There is no business.

885
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,601
What?

886
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,922
Bioplex has been
dead for years.

887
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,925
I just raise money to pay
debts to keep things going.

888
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,728
It's all gonna
come crashing down.

889
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,282
Etta was my last hope and
she thinks I'm a swindler.

890
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,730
She's probably right.

891
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,682
I'm so sorry, we're
gonna lose everything.

892
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,531
I'm going to jail.

893
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,081
Why would you--

894
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,242
It was the only
way I could keep you.

895
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,486
I mean, come on.

896
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,847
A guy like me with
a woman like you?

897
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,289
I wanted to give
you nice things.

898
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,411
A nice home, make you happy,

899
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,369
give you the life you deserve.

900
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,520
I just thought that you
weren't interested anymore.

901
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,846
Oh no.

902
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,451
I did it all for you.

903
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,691
Merry Christmas.

904
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,886
I'm sorry.

905
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,521
Taylor!

906
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,601
Taylor!

907
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,166
Taylor!
Dad!

908
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,208
Diane: Go, get in, get in!

909
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,851
Shhh...

910
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,925
It's okay, it's okay.

911
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,370
It's okay, it's okay.

912
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,561
Mom...

913
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,442
There's something on my leg.

914
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,607
There's something on my leg.

915
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,164
Shhh...

916
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,764
Caprice, I love you,

917
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,201
I love you, run, go, run!

918
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,244
Right here, you son of a bitch!

919
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,525
What are you doing?

920
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,400
Can you move the light?

921
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,891
What happened?
We couldn't wake you up.

922
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,644
Aren't you cold like that?

923
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,280
Where's Dylan?

924
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,800
In the room.

925
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,925
That room?

926
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,605
What's he doing there?

927
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,368
He wanted me to
join him, but...

928
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,247
I wanted to stay here with you.

929
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,761
Right.

930
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,200
Molly...

931
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,646
Are you sure?

932
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,208
This is what you
want, isn't it?

933
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,361
Ben...

934
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,929
What the fuck, what the fuck,

935
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,286
what the fuck did you do to me?

936
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,089
What did I do to you?

937
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,486
Fuck.

938
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,361
Who's there?

939
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,366
Dylan, is that you?

940
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,641
Dylan?

941
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,127
Dylan?

942
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,721
Ben, no.

943
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,521
Don't.

944
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,562
Man: <i>I guess
you're ready to listen now.</i>

945
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,606
What do I do?

946
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,208
Man: <i>Listen good,
you gotta bring</i>

947
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,487
<i>the creature back to the grove.</i>

948
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,770
<i>But you gotta be careful,
it won't come willingly.</i>

949
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,046
<i>It's tasted human pleasures.</i>

950
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,441
What about Will?

951
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,760
<i>Man: The only way is to bring</i>

952
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,729
<i>the changeling back,</i>

953
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,009
<i>but don't let it sense your
intension, it senses things.</i>

954
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,247
<i>It cannot feel threatened.</i>

955
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,921
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

956
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,081
Hello?

957
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,681
Hello?

958
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,921
Will.

959
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,169
Do you wanna go for a ride?

960
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,641
Hey, Will.

961
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,203
You wanna put your boots on?

962
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,161
Come on, baby.

963
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,331
You and mommy can go

964
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,209
have some fun outside.

965
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,724
Yeah, come on, buddy.

966
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,049
Come on, you little devils!

967
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,770
Come on, you jolly fu--

968
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,481
' got ya!

969
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,130
Come here, Santa,
you fat bastard!

970
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,881
You again!

971
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,525
It's complete and utter chaos

972
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,840
down at the mall, police and

973
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,206
emergency cruiser on the scene,

974
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,806
we don't really know
what's going on,

975
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,451
still no word from
Stormin' Norman.

976
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,201
But I'm sure a crusty ol bird

977
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,282
like Norman will be fine.

978
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,289
We give Norman a hard
time around here,

979
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,681
but he's the weatherman, so...

980
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,645
I think he has a Master's Degree

981
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,291
from Colombia or something
depressing like that.

982
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,923
But we love him, so check in

983
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,729
as soon as you can, Normey.

984
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,849
In the meantime, it's my job to

985
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,251
keep the Christmas spirit alive

986
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,964
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

987
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,046
Let's give this next
yuletide tune a spin.

988
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,921
Oh, man.

989
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,001
Hello?

990
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,682
Don't point that
thing at me, honey.

991
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,371
Put it down, it's okay.

992
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,841
I brought it.

993
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,402
Thanks.
What's the matter with you?

994
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,165
There's so many of them.

995
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,081
It's all right, they're not gonna
touch you as long as I'm here,

996
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,525
they're afraid of me.

997
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,968
I know how to herd them,
herd them good.

998
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,850
The trolls have been on
our land for generations.

999
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,049
I guess you could say
I watch over them.

1000
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,766
Thanks for bringing
this one back,

1001
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,161
it would've sensed me
coming from a mile away.

1002
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,362
I brought it like you said.

1003
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,211
Now where's my son?

1004
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,041
I don't know.

1005
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,201
What'd you do?

1006
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,125
You keep running
off and now look

1007
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,804
what you've done, now
look what you've done!

1008
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,450
What are you doing,
where's my son?!

1009
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,885
The little devils
never listen,

1010
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,564
they never listen no matter
how many times I tell them.

1011
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,561
What?

1012
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,846
Where is he?

1013
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,281
I want my son back!

1014
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,840
I wish I could help,
but I can't, it's not up to me.

1015
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,126
You lied to me!

1016
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,770
It killed my husband!

1017
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,610
Don't hurt it!
Put the gun--

1018
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,201
No!

1019
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,407
MY baby boy, please.

1020
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,486
My son.

1021
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,005
Oh, Will...

1022
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,007
Mommy?

1023
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,521
Come here!

1024
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,840
Is that really you?

1025
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,686
Oh, look at you, oh, God,
oh, baby.

1026
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,047
on, baby.

1027
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,801
- I got lost.
-Oh, it's okay, baby.

1028
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,571
It's okay, it's okay, baby.

1029
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,324
It's okay, sweetheart.

1030
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,445
It's okay, baby.

1031
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,965
Let's go home.

1032
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,361
Ben: Dylan?

1033
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,561
Molly!

1034
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,040
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

1035
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,641
Dylan.

1036
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,481
Ben: No.

1037
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,846
Dylan...

1038
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,931
Oh, God.

1039
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,767
Grace wants me to carry her son.

1040
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,921
Who?

1041
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,608
That 15 year
old girl who tried

1042
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,160
to get rid of her baby,
this is her room.

1043
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,841
Molly, where are
you getting this from?

1044
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,365
Connor and Jenna wouldn't

1045
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,568
help her, but you and I did.

1046
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,762
I'm going to have her child.

1047
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,650
You brought us down here!

1048
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,289
You fucked me!

1049
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,205
You killed Dylan!

1050
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,767
Molly! Molly!

1051
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,088
Help me, Molly!

1052
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,561
Aunt Etta!

1053
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,126
Etta!

1054
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,204
Etta, let me in!

1055
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,691
Aunt Etta!

1056
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,560
Etta!

1057
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,130
Don't leave me out here!

1058
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,961
Etta!

1059
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,004
Etta, help me!

1060
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,169
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

1061
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,369
It is almost dawn.

1062
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,530
We will be safe.

1063
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,641
Shouldn't we try and fix this

1064
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,210
to trap him again.

1065
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,325
Whatever do you mean?

1066
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,005
Wasn't that how he got out?

1067
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,562
When Duncan broke it?

1068
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:56,125
Oh no, dear, this
is just an ornament.

1069
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,409
Then how did
Gerhart turn into it?

1070
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,327
Krampus is a Christmas spirit.

1071
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,963
Like your father said...

1072
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,249
The Christmas spirit
can fill anyone.

1073
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,683
But if your heart is
blackened with anger

1074
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,889
and vindictiveness,
then this spirit

1075
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,601
will fill it until you
become a hellish beast.

1076
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,843
A hunter of the wicked.

1077
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,969
Gerhart's anger let it in and--

1078
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,725
He came after us.

1079
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,889
So you kicked Gerhart out
after you kicked us out.

1080
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,840
Then you put the
cross on the door

1081
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,281
to protect yourself
from Krampus, right?

1082
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,281
Yes.

1083
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,124
That's why you sent us away.

1084
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,526
What?

1085
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,965
You knew my fucked
up family would be

1086
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,042
shark bait for that thing,
so you got rid of us.

1087
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,884
Wait, it isn't
like that at all--

1088
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:51,961
Sure it is!

1089
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,326
You thought Gerhart
was gonna turn

1090
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,686
so you sent us away knowing that

1091
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,841
he would come after us.

1092
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,161
You sacrificed us
for Krampus to save

1093
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,685
your selfish old ass!

1094
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,047
Oh, please, please,
now calm yourself.

1095
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,841
You don't know the forces
that you are playing with.

1096
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,331
Yes I do.

1097
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,810
And I know something else.

1098
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,049
You've been a bad girl.

1099
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,286
Mother of God!

1100
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,924
Police are telling
people just to stay away.

1101
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,163
All right, just keep
clear of the mall.

1102
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,922
I know a lot of you are worried

1103
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,890
about your friends
and family, well the

1104
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,567
best thing you can
do is just stay put.

1105
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,969
And pray for a
Christmas miracle.

1106
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,724
Still no word on
how many hostages

1107
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,121
there may be down there, but...

1108
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,686
Just stay at home.

1109
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,090
For the love of God.

1110
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,251
ls that you, dear?

1111
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,120
Who's there?

1112
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,961
Ah!

1113
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,603
Martha, is that you?

1114
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,211
Martha: Leave me alone.

1115
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,011
It's safe now.

1116
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,006
It's over.

1117
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,691
Martha: It's not over!

1118
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,848
Oh, my darling.

1119
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,806
Who's there?

1120
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,808
I knew it.

1121
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,561
Krampus!

1122
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,883
Vile enemy of Christmas.

1123
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,249
We end this tonight.

1124
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,286
<i>Man". Norman, stop!</i>

1125
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,088
Please don't kill me, Norman.

1126
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,521
Norman?

1127
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,651
Who's Norman?

1128
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,687
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Norman?

1129
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,083
<i>Norman: Martha, is that you?</i>

1130
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,921
<i>- Leave me alone.
- Norman: It's only me.</i>

1131
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:32,122
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1132
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,001
Fuck!

1133
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,925
Ho ho ho!

1134
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,961
It's time.

1135
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,402
Cop: Freeze!
Put your hands up now!

1136
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,601
Ahhh!

1137
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,281
<i>Dan". What the
hell is it about</i>

1138
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,089
<i>Christmas in Bailey Downs?</i>

1139
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,725
<i>Are we cursed or something?</i>

1140
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,403
<i>Why does this season of love and</i>

1141
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,609
<i>peace and goodwill keep ending</i>

1142
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,286
<i>in blood and death and horror?</i>

1143
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,926
<i>You keep the spirit</i>

1144
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,286
<i>in your hearts, you
hear me, people,</i>

1145
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,486
<i>you hug your loved ones and you</i>

1146
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,686
<i>keep them close
and you treat them</i>

1147
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,007
<i>every Christmas like
it might be your last.</i>

1148
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,890
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>

1149
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,122
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

1150
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,929
<i>Over the fields we go</i>

1151
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,809
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

1152
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,930
<i>Bells on bobtail ring</i>

1153
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,843
<i>Making spirits bright</i>

1154
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,127
<i>What fun it is
To ride and sing</i>

1155
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,163
<i>A sleighing song tonight</i>

1156
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,164
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

1157
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,083
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

1158
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,003
<i>Oh what fun it is to ride</i>

1159
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,242
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

1162
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,566
<i>Dan". Let's go to the phones.</i>

1163
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,846
<i>Man: Hey look, if they just had</i>

1164
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,365
<i>more police training,
then stuff like this--</i>

1165
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,249
You think,
more police can do

1166
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:50,403
anything? Are you...
It's Christmas!

1167
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,484
There are magical
dark forces out there.

1168
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,329
People, wake up!

1169
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,647
It's a beautiful
season, it's light

1170
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,929
and it's dark and it's
ying and it's yang.

1171
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,604
For our Asian friends out there,

1172
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,091
you know who you are.

1173
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,970
I said Asian, right?
I didn't say Oriental, right?

1174
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,801
Well I don't know!

1175
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,245
You tell me which is offensive.

1176
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,765
I'm a Christmas expert.

1177
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,562
It's 11 Lords a-leapin'
and ten maids a-milkin'.

1178
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,210
No, no, no, don't go to...

1179
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,487
Don't you Google that!

1180
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,886
I hate it!

1181
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,442
We as a society
can't go five minutes

1182
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,603
without looking up a...

1183
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,166
No wait a minute,
somebody's texting me.

1184
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,808
It's 11 pipers piping,
I'm way off, I'm sorry.

1185
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,482
Merry Christmas, everybody.
