special...

544

vulnerable.

01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:19,436
- They're beautiful.
- I'm a designer.

Wow.
Now, that's a privilege.

708
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:27,891

Emerson Blackwood rivaled Audubon.

710
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:32,385

Where?

711
01:02:32,786 --> 01:02:34,554
There in the house,
supposedly.

Hello?

715
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:36,481
Now, it's pretty ironic,
really.

716
01:03:36,882 --> 01:03:38,182
For a committed realist,

717
01:03:38,183 --> 01:03:41,120
someone who insisted
on drawing only from nature,

718
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:43,588
to do these
at the end of his life.

719
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:45,023
I've looked at everything
by Blackwood,

720
01:03:45,024 --> 01:03:46,524
and I've never
seen any of these.

721
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:49,259
Oh, you wouldn't. The family made it
a restricted donation.

722
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,028
These may never
be published.

723
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:52,605
Is it possible
to get copies?

724
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:55,867
I'll see what I can do.

Have you ever
read Machen?

727
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:03,420
Arthur Machen. Welsh.

728
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:04,842
He believed
in fairy folk,

729
01:04:05,043 --> 01:04:07,415
these ancient entities
from the netherworld,

730
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:08,816
predating mankind.

731
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,549
Blackwood
quotes him extensively.

732
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,818
Here, uh... that line.
There.

733
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:15,719
"One life
must be taken".

734
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,921
These creatures had to take
one human life...

735
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:20,492
every time they emerged
to replenish their ranks.

736
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:23,094
Many of these creatures
fed on the bones,

737
01:04:23,095 --> 01:04:25,063
the teeth
of young children.

738
01:04:25,464 --> 01:04:28,300
And then there's a... a truce,
a pact of sorts,

739
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,870
between Pope Sylvester the 2nd
and these ancient beings...

740
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,683
in the year 9 hundred
and 99.

741
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:34,906
In exchange
for human teeth,

742
01:04:35,107 --> 01:04:37,891
they start leaving
silver pieces under the pillow.

drawing by Emerson Blackwood,

and the loss of his child.

His child?

vanished, lost.

he disappeared.

They will find us and hurt us.
