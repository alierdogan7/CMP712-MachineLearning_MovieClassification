that a centipede inflicts

00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,481
- God, I cannot believe
I am here

374
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,984
auditioning for
a Quentin Tarantino film.

375
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,896
My agents are so excited
about this.

376
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,930
I should probably call them,

377
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:51,600
tell them I landed
and, you know, I'm on my way.

378

379
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,378

<i>The Human Centipede?</i>

[Coughs quietly]

381
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,284
- I was really drawn
to the film

382
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,910
because of
the medical aspect of it.

383
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,386
If you were a surgeon,

384
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,912
you could actually perform
that surgery.

385
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,425
It's just so scary.

386
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,591
It was so grueling
being on all fours,

387
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,328
so I demanded in my contract
that I had to have

388
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,097
an hour-long massage
every night.

389
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,003
I mean, why would I not
demand that in my contract?

390
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,973
Oh, and the rest of the cast,

391
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,499
we all took showers before we
shot the centipede stuff,

392
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,239
because I mean, you're close
to someone's butt,

393
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:32,544
and you don't want to smell
anything and...

394
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,345
or, you know, whatever.

395
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:35,874
I'm kind of a germaphobe.

396
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,943
