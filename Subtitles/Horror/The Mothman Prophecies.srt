1
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,500
Jesus!

2
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,600
Are you still there?

3
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,100
No, I'm back.

4
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not sure I got the spelling.

5
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,000
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,500
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.

8
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,400
I'll catch a ride
and see you out there. Bye.

9
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,700
- Jack.
- Yeah?

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,200
The Balkans peace council is "comprised"
or "composed" of ten members?

11
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
Twelve members.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,700
Oh, right. Thanks.

13
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,700
Composed.

14
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,200
What?

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,800
A three-block area
has been evacuated.

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
You might wanna avoid that route
coming home from work.

17
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,500
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.

18
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,200
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.

19
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,100
What?

20
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,400
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,400
It'll look bad, my star reporter
not showing up at the Christmas party.

22
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,400
I can't.

23
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Mary's waiting for me.

24
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,500
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.

25
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,900
That's if you want it.

26
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,400
But we're gonna have to
make an offer today.

27
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,400
The owner's highly motivated.

28
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.

29
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,300
Take a look around.

30
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,300
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Thank you very much.

32
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,100
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.

33
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
My God.

34
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,500
Here you are.

35
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,000
We were just making sure
there was adequate closet space.

36
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,700
Good. Good.

37
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,300
Well, this house is yours
if you want it...

38
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,900
but you have to
decide right now.

39
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
We'll take it.

40
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Really? Oh, my God!

41
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,600
You know what I kept thinking
when we were looking at that house?

42
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,600
That we should get
a mattress for that closet.

43
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,900
I kept thinking that
it felt like a dream come true.

44
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Come here.

45
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.

46
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,700
Let's see.

47
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,900
Okay.

48
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,200
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.

49
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
We bought a big house.

50
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Mary.

51
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,900
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.

52
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Are you okay?

53
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!

54
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,700
Hold on, darling.

55
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
911, there's been an accident.

56
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
Yes.

57
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,700
Nothing.

58
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,100
You okay?

59
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah.

60
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
All right.
It's all right.

61
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,600
It's all right.
It's just me.

62
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,600
You didn't see it, did you?

63
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,500
See what?

64
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
What did you see?

65
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I didn't see anything.

66
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,800
There's something wrong with me.

67
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,200
It's called a glioblastoma.

68
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,700
It's a temporal lobe tumor.

69
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,300
According to the doctor,
it's extremely rare.

70
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,400
One in...

71
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
600,000 gets this thing.

72
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,400
Did they say it was
a result of the accident?

73
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,100
No, it turns out...

74
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
that it's been there a while.

75
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
There's nothing else they can do?

76
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,400
They did the surgery, and they
couldn't get it all out, so they'll...

77
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
keep her on the chemo...

78
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,300
as long as her strength holds out.

79
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,500
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.

80
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,500
Good.

81
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
That's good.

82
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,400
Two weeks ago...

83
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,400
we were house hunting.

84
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
One day you're just
driving along in your car...

85
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,700
and the universe...

86
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,900
just points at you and says...

87
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
"Ah, there you are,
a happy couple.

88
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
I've been looking for you.

89
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,700
I've been looking for you."

90
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
For what?

92
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,800
For all of this.

93
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,300
I feel like
I ruined everything.

94
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,500
You didn't ruin anything.

95
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,500
Not a damn thing.

96
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,700
I want you to be happy.

97
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,400
You didn't see it, did you?

98
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
Yes.

99
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah?

100
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
She knew.

101
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,500
What?

102
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
She was drawing angels.

103
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,800
It was the meanness
of the campaigns...

104
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,700
the almost complete lack
of candor and honesty...

105
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
that turned the voters off..

106
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,300
I think that these parties
are demonizing each other.

107
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,100
They're projecting our own
personal fears and anxieties...

108
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,100
onto the national stage.

109
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,800
People don't like it. People are
very, very unsatisfied at the moment.

110
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,900
It makes them complacent because they
don't see any possibility of change.

111
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,100
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate
out there for the Democrats?

112
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,500
Well, I'm hearing a lot
about Russ McCallum.

113
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...

114
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Hey, I told her to watch.

115
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,200
Who?

116
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,700
Peter's friend Gwen.

117
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,600
She'll be there tonight.

118
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,900
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make that one tonight.

119
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,500
Come on, you can't keep
blowing this thing off.

120
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,900
I'm not. I've got an interview
with the governor.

121
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,600
I gotta be in Richmond
at 8:00 in the morning.

122
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,500
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.

123
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,000
They bumped the meeting
till tomorrow night.

124
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
Eddie, look, I...

125
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Look...

126
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,300
she's not Mary.

127
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,000
Not by a mile.

128
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,700
But you know what?

129
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,000
No one ever will be.

130
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,000
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.

131
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,700
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.

132
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,100
Maybe some other time.

133
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,300
It's about 1:00 in the morning.

134
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,200
I'm a little wired,
so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.

135
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

136
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Al I right, come on.

137
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late,
but my car broke down just up the road.

138
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
I wondered if I could
use the phone.

139
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,700
Hello.

140
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
It's him.

141
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,200
I been waitin' for you.

142
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?

143
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
Get the door! Get the door!

144
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,500
Just stay right there.

145
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,800
Mister, I don't know who you...

146
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Shut up!

147
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Shut up.

148
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,700
Honey, Connie's here.

149
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,600
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?

150
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay, why don't you just...

151
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,400
put down the gun and tell me
what's going on here.

152
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,500
Yeah.

153
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.

154
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,200
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.

155
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
Two nights ago...

156
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,900
at 2:30 in the a.m.,
there's a bang on the door.

157
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,300
I open it up,
and here's this guy.

158
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,600
He says he wants to use the phone.

159
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
But there's something
creepy about him...

160
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,500
so I tell him to get lost.

161
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,300
Last night at 2:30 on the dot,
guess who's back.

162
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,300
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?

163
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,900
I am absolutely positive
it's Mr. Klein.

164
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,500
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.

165
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,800
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?

166
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,500
I warned him off my property.

167
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,500
I used the word "trespass",
and he still came back.

168
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,700
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I
had the right to shoot you on my porch.

169
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
He'd have to been
inside the house, Gordon.

170
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,300
What?

171
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Fine.

172
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,800
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might
come back, and sure enough, there he is.

173
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,400
It wasn't me.

174
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I don't know what's happening here.

175
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,400
Something's very wrong here.

176
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,900
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.

177
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm from DC. Look.

178
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,800
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?

179
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm from DC.

180
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,600
John Klein.

181
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,500
Washington Post.

182
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes.

183
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
Can I get out of this shower now?

184
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,700
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.

185
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,700
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.

186
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,700
Just call me.

187
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,200
Just find out what he wants.

188
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,100
So, you didn't actually see the guy
before tonight?

189
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,600
No.

190
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,600
But I heard the knocking.

191
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,700
Three nights in a row.

192
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

193
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,700
I'm gonna give you a ride into town,
unless you wanna sleep in your car.

194
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,200
I can call for a tow
in the morning.

195
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,100
You're a long way from DC.

196
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
What are you doing here?

197
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,700
Driving through.

198
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,200
We're not on the way
to anyplace, Mr. Klein.

199
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
I recognize you.

200
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,900
DC Review.

201
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,100
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.

202
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,500
So I'm not under arrest?

203
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.

204
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,600
No breaking and entering.

205
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,600
You've had trouble
with him before?

206
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,700
Gordy and Denise? No.

207
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,200
They're good people.

208
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,200
Things have just been
a little strange around here lately.

209
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,200
You still haven't told me what you're
doing here in the middle of the night.

210
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,900
I don't know.

211
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,700
Where am I?

212
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,600
Think you could show me
where we are on the map here?

213
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,200
We're right on the state line.

214
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,400
With Ohio.

215
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,300
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.

216
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,800
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it
would've taken me six hours to get here.

217
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,300
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.

218
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,900
By the way, don't worry about your pal
the governor. I'll take care of it.

219
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah. Okay.

220
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,000
Thanks, Eddie.

221
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,800
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.

222
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,400
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?

223
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,200
Strange.

224
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.

225
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,600
I said I can't find
anything wrong with her.

226
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,600
Mr. Smallwood.

227
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,200
Mr. Smallwood...

228
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,100
I just wanted to apologize for that
misunderstanding we had last night.

229
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,900
Are you sure it was me that came by
the last couple of nights?

230
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,600
Listen, mister.

231
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,600
Connie called me.

232
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,600
She told me that you check out,
and that's good enough for me.

233
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm perfectly willing
to let it go.

234
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,500
But I don't drink anymore...

235
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
and I don't lie.

236
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,500
And as far as I know,
I'm not crazy.

237
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,400
So if you're accusing me...

238
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,300
Look, here's the thing.

239
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,100
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.

240
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,100
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.

241
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,400
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...

242
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,000
I traveled 400 miles and ended up
on that road by your house...

243
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,400
and I've got no memory of it.

244
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,200
And you call me crazy?

245
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
I was afraid I'd see you here.

246
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Okay.

247
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,500
You didn't show up.

248
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,100
Too bad. I really wanted
to know what I look like.

249
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,900
Sergeant, I'm curious.

250
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Last night you said...

251
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,000
things had been strange...

252
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,500
around here lately.

253
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,800
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.

254
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Now I really need to know.

255
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,600
Just your odd reports.

256
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,100
People seeing things they can't explain,
so they all come to me.

257
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,700
'Cause you're the cop.

258
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
Because they know me.

259
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,300
You know, if there are
other people in this town...

260
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,300
who are feeling as...

261
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,400
confused as I am right now...

262
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
I'd sure like to hear it.

263
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,000
The past few months,
people have been coming up to me...

264
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,800
and reporting that they've
been seeing strange things.

265
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,400
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.

266
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
I've known these folks
my entire life...

267
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,200
and they seem down right embarrassed
to be bringing it up.

268
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,100
Bringing what up?

269
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,200
It's hard to explain.

270
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,300
Weird lights,
strange phone calls, you.

271
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,900
Seeing a UFO is one thing.

272
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,900
What do you do when someone tells you
they saw this in their backyard?

273
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,700
What is it?

274
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,100
My wife died two years ago.

275
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,500
She saw something.

276
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,100
Drew pictures.

277
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,700
Who showed you this?

278
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,600
It was right here.

279
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,600
There was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch.

280
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,000
That makes it about...

281
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,300
eight feet tall.

282
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,200
Yeah.

283
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,600
I was getting ready for bed and just
happened to glance out the window.

284
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
At first all I could see...

285
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,000
were these two red eyes.

286
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I kept looking at it.

287
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,000
I couldn't stop.

288
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,000
I've never had that feeling before,
like I couldn't move.

289
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,900
And then I guess it just...

290
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,300
took off..

291
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,500
That may not make much sense,
but it's...

292
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,000
the only way I can
put it into words.

293
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,300
You didn't see it, did you?

294
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,700
It started about two months ago.

295
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,700
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.

296
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,500
The first one was just
a loud beeping noise.

297
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Now they're mostly
these creaking, howling sounds.

298
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,000
They all like this?

299
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,000
Well, once it was a man
talking really fast.

300
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,700
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.

301
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,600
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?

302
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,300
I even had our number changed.

303
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,800
But before I got a chance
to give it out to anyone...

304
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,900
the calls started again.

305
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,600
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.

306
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,200
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.

307
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,100
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?

308
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,700
Shucks, no.
A real live house.

309
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,000
Indoor plumbing and everything.

310
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Sorry.

311
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,000
We even had shoes for church
and schoolin' and stuff.

312
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,300
All right, all right.

313
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,600
Where the hell are you?

314
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,100
I'm still here.

315
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,300
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.

316
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,200
Something's come up.

317
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,100
You're kidding. Something of
national interest in West Virginia?

318
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.

319
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
Cy's beginning to look rabid.

320
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,400
Keep him at bay, okay?

321
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,100
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.

322
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.

323
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,400
We were parked up here...

324
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,600
and sort a making out
in the back seat.

325
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,300
And what happened next...

326
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,900
is sort of hard to explain.

327
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,200
Next day...

328
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,100
I woke up and...

329
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,100
both my...

330
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,100
my eyes were swelled up.

331
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,800
What did the doctors say?

332
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
He couldn't explain it.

333
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,100
See this one here?

334
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,200
It ain't never healed.

335
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,800
We're getting engaged.

336
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,100
That's good.

337
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,300
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.

338
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,300
Last night I woke up...

339
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,500
with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

340
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,300
I went into the bathroom
to get some aspirin...

341
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,000
and I happened
to look in the mirror...

342
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
and...

343
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,300
I swear to God...

344
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,300
I see something...

345
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
I can't describe.

346
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,900
But it sure as hell...

347
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,700
is not my reflection.

348
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,900
And then...

349
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,400
I hear...

350
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,600
this weird...

351
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,300
howl...

352
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,200
coming out of the sink.

353
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,700
And there's a voice.

354
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,700
It's a voice...

355
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,800
and it's saying...

356
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,500
"Do not be afraid.

357
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,800
Ninety-nine will die.

358
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,900
Denver Nine."

359
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,600
I even wrote it down.

360
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,100
He just keeps saying the same thing
over and over for an hour...

361
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,900
and then it stops.

362
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper...

363
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,300
where I wrote down the words...

364
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,100
and this thing is on it.

365
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,900
I did not draw that.

366
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,800
- Gordon?
- What?

367
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Gordon, you...
your ear's bleeding.

368
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,400
What?

369
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,400
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.

370
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,400
No sign of any physical problem.

371
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,300
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.

372
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,800
What you had, Gordon,
was a first-class migraine.

373
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,300
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.

374
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,800
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.

375
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,400
He had hallucinations,
heard voices.

376
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,700
Aren't they both associated
with glioblastoma?

377
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,900
I see nothing here to suggest...

378
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,900
something as exotic
as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein...

379
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,500
but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist...

380
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
for a second opinion.

381
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,500
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.

382
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,000
Thank you.

383
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Thank you very much.

384
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,500
Wait. Wait.

385
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,500
He's not wrong.

386
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,100
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

387
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,500
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.

388
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,800
There's nothing wrong.

389
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,800
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear
and he tells you, you got a headache...

390
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,300
Yes, well, you're not sick,
so that is good news.

391
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,600
I wish I was sick. Then I would
know why this is happening.

392
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,000
You shouldn't say things like that.

393
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,400
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.

394
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,100
I'm hearing voices.

395
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,100
Was your wife hearing voices
before she had her tumor?

396
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,100
No.

397
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,800
13 News is headed to the scene,
and we'll have a live report in minutes.

398
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,000
Again our top story, Domain Air
flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.

399
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,400
An airline representative is expected
to make a statement shortly.

400
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,900
There is no confirmation...

401
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,900
but all 99 passengers and crew members
are believed dead.

402
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Wow, man.

403
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,200
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?

404
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,900
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.

405
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,100
I'm working on
a pretty strange story.

406
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,800
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out.

407
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,200
I'm particularly interested in your
theories on precognition and prophecies.

408
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,200
Anything you want to know
is in the book.

409
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,700
Yeah, but the chapter that you have
on the entities you call...

410
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,300
Were you contacted...

411
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,300
or are you pretending to have
a professional interest?

412
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,800
Yeah... No.

413
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm a reporter
for The Washington Post.

414
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,400
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.

415
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,100
I don't understand.

416
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,900
To hear a voice is one thing...

417
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,900
but this isn't just a message,
it's a prediction.

418
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,500
It came true.

419
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,900
These things Gordon's having,
are they dreams or hallucinations?

420
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,200
The way he describes them,
they sound like dreams.

421
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,700
I don't know.

422
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,200
He believes they're real.

423
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I had a dream like that.

424
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,700
Yeah?

425
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,900
It was nighttime...

426
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,500
and I was
in the middle of the ocean.

427
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,300
I was trying to swim,
but I was too cold.

428
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,900
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something...

429
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,200
to hang on to.

430
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,300
And there were presents...

431
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,600
floating all around me.

432
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,200
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.

433
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,300
I tried to grab on to them,
but they kept popping away.

434
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,700
And then I started to sink...

435
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,400
like a stone.

436
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.

437
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,500
But it felt good.

438
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,200
I was letting go.

439
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,000
I was letting myself go...

440
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,200
and...

441
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,800
all I could see...

442
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,300
was black...

443
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,900
and all I could feel
was the darkness above me...

444
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,900
and the lights...

445
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,800
coming from below.

446
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,400
I knew I was dying.

447
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,100
And then I heard this voice,
like somebody whispering in my ear.

448
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,400
"Wake up, number 37."

449
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,500
And then I woke up.

450
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,200
What do you think that means?

451
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,400
Number 37?

452
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,000
I have absolutely no idea.

453
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,500
I met him.

454
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,400
The guy who told me
about the plane crash.

455
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,700
You met him?

456
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Yeah.

457
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,300
I met him.

458
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,700
Last night, coming home
from work about midnight.

459
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,700
I'm driving past the cement plant...

460
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,000
out by the chemical factory.

461
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,100
Right.

462
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,200
Something happened.

463
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,600
Bright...

464
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,000
flash.

465
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,200
Lightning.

466
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,500
Something...

467
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,000
encircles me.

468
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,900
Everything's kind of hot.

469
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,600
I feel like I can't catch...

470
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,500
catch my breath.

471
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,400
He looked human.

472
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,200
But there was just something...

473
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,800
wrong about him.

474
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,000
That's when I heard the voice.

475
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,900
The same voice
that I heard two nights ago.

476
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,400
He said...

477
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,400
"Do not be afraid.

478
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,200
My name...

479
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,200
is Indrid Cold."

480
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,300
And he said to me...

481
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
"In a place this size.

482
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,800
Equator.

483
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,900
Three hundred.

484
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,700
Three hundred will die.

485
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,100
Wait for me.

486
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,700
I will return.

487
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,200
I will see you in time."

488
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,700
And that was it.

489
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,100
It's a little...

490
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Have a look.

491
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,600
She knew.

492
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,400
I didn't see anything.

493
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,800
You want to hear
the chief's latest phone call?

494
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,600
Yes?

495
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,400
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?

496
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,700
I know I sounded crazy the other day,
but things are getting weird out here.

497
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,100
Slow down, Gordon.

498
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,600
- He's here.
- Who's here?

499
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,200
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.

500
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,800
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.

501
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,200
Gordon, let me talk to him.

502
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,600
Sure. Hang on.

503
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,400
Hello, John Klein.

504
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,200
Who is this?

505
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,800
My name is Indrid Cold.

506
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

507
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,600
Your father was born
in Racine, Wisconsin.

508
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,700
He lived in a green house
on Monroe Street.

509
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,500
You don't remember
how your mother looked.

510
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,600
Okay, you got my attention.

511
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,400
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.

512
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,600
Under the bed.

513
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,300
Very good, John.
Thank you.

514
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,700
What's in my hand?

515
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,600
Chap Stick.

516
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,400
You're reading my mind,
aren't you?

517
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,000
Did you read my mind?

518
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,200
I have no need to, do I?

519
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,700
What's the third line of page 51?

520
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,000
"A broken smile
beneath her whispered wings."

521
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,900
Still more proof, John Klein?

522
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900
What do you look like?

523
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,200
It depends on who's looking.

524
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,900
I want to meet you.

525
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,400
You already have, John.

526
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,200
I have seen you afraid.

527
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,700
You're afraid right now,
aren't you?

528
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,300
Can I ask you something?

529
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,400
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

530
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,800
What happened to my wife?

531
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,200
You were there.

532
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,400
Mary Klein cannot be found
by looking.

533
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,900
You will see her in time.

534
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,000
What's up, Connie?

535
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
Everything okay?

536
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Did you just call John?

537
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,700
I've been asleep since 9:00.

538
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,200
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

539
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,000
See? It's sticking up here
around 1,950 cycles per second.

540
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,600
But it never gets any lower
than maybe 1,930 or so.

541
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,600
But yours is way down here
in the normal vocal range...

542
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,300
anywhere between 1,000
and 1,200 cycles per second.

543
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,900
Okay, so this guy's vocal range
is much higher than mine.

544
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,500
What makes you think it's a man?

545
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,300
Still more proof, John Klein?

546
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,600
What is it?

547
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,200
Near as I can tell, it's...

548
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,700
an electrical impulse.

549
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,100
But whatever it is, it's not
coming from human vocal cords.

550
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,700
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

551
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,500
What happened to my wife?

552
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,800
You were there.

553
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,300
Mary Klein cannot be found
by looking.

554
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,800
You will see her in time.

555
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,800
This isn't like you. We used to rip on
this stuff. when it came over the wire.

556
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,900
Yeah, I know.

557
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,700
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.

558
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,800
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.

559
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,300
I'll back you up.

560
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,000
I just wanna make sure
you still got a job...

561
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,600
when you're done doing
whatever it is you're doing down there.

562
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.

563
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,000
What time is your flight?

564
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,800
8:00 a.m.

565
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,100
Am I crazy?

566
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,000
No.

567
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,100
I am crazy.

568
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Alexander Leek.

569
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,700
- Who the hell are you?
-John Klein. I called you last week.

570
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,900
Do you know what that is?

571
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,800
Stay away.

572
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,900
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.

573
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,100
Where are they seeing it?

574
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,100
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

575
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,500
You can help me.

576
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,900
Follow me.

577
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,900
The nocturnal butterfly.

578
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,200
In ancient cultures, the moth
represents a form of the psyche...

579
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,000
or the soul immortally trapped...

580
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,700
in the hellish death realms.

581
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,100
Mothman.

582
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,300
That's what the Ukranians called him.
Rough translation, of course.

583
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,600
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl
the year the nuclear plant went down.

584
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,900
Galveston, 1969,
just before the hurricane.

585
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,400
They saw it.

586
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,500
But seeing isn't always believing.

587
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,500
Look, there's never been
a single shred of evidence...

588
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,400
to show that these things
exist materially.

589
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,200
So you're telling me
these things do not exist?

590
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,100
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things
exist around us that we never see.

591
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,000
Electricity, microwaves,
infrared waves.

592
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,300
You know, these things
have been around forever.

593
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,500
They show up in cave paintings.

594
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,100
They're a normal condition
of the planet.

595
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,600
They're just not part of our consensus
of what constitutes...

596
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,700
physical reality.

597
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,100
What are they part of, then?

598
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,900
You're asking for an explanation...

599
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,500
for something...

600
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:42,100
that can't be explained
rationally.

601
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,500
You know the buildup of energy
before something happens?

602
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,000
The way your hair stands up
before lightning strikes?

603
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,300
"Before something happens."
Do you mean they cause disasters?

604
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,000
Why would they need to?

605
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,800
All right, then...

606
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
are they trying to warn me?

607
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,100
Their motivations...

608
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,100
aren't human.

609
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,500
All right,
then what do they want?

610
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,500
I have no idea.

611
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,000
What you really want
is to know...

612
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,200
why you?

613
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,900
Yes.

614
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,600
You noticed them,
and they noticed that you noticed them.

615
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,100
Most people aren't sensitive enough
to see them...

616
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,800
without some kind of...

617
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,000
trauma.

618
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,800
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

619
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,600
Last week my friend
got a strange phone call...

620
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,800
from an entity...

621
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,600
a spirit, whatever.

622
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,500
It seemed to know everything.

623
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,100
Like God?

624
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,400
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.

625
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,900
His name was Indrid Cold.

626
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,100
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.

627
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,400
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.

628
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:32,200
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke
to, he's off by more than a few degrees.

629
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,700
Then how do you explain
that it knows everything?

630
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,800
Look at that.

631
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,500
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away,
that window washer could likely see it.

632
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,600
That doesn't mean he's God...

633
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,600
or even smarter than we are.

634
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,700
But from where he's sitting...

635
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,700
he can see
a little further down the road.

636
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,600
I think we can assume that...

637
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,600
these entities
are more advanced than us.

638
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:06,300
Why don't they just come right out
and tell us what's on their minds?

639
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,300
You're more advanced
than a cockroach.

640
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,300
Have you ever tried explaining yourself
to one of them?

641
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,600
How many people have seen it?

642
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,600
Ten. Twenty, maybe.

643
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,200
Listen to me. Something terrible
is going to happen in Point Pleasant.

644
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,400
Don't go back.

645
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,300
Stay away.

646
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,700
I can't talk about this anymore.

647
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,300
There is a reason...

648
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,400
that I ended up in Point Pleasant.

649
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,300
Something brought me there.

650
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,400
Whatever brought you there...

651
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,900
brought you there to die.

652
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,400
You're just in time. They're just
about to light this Christmas tree.

653
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,900
They have been
for the last two hours.

654
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,300
Isn't that Denise?

655
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Is she okay?

656
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,900
She left Gordon.

657
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,400
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.

658
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,500
Shit.

659
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,700
- Where is he?
- Who knows?

660
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,000
Be back in a second.

661
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,900
Connie.

662
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,400
What's wrong?

663
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,000
Fifteen more people
reported seeing that thing today.

664
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,300
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.

665
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.

666
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,100
How was Chicago?

667
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
What did he say?

668
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,600
He wouldn't see me.

669
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,900
Shit.

670
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,800
You all right?

671
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,500
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.

672
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,100
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.

673
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,400
Everybody in this town is looking at me
like I'm insane. You know why?

674
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,200
Denise and all the others,
they don't know, John.

675
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,800
I do.

676
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,300
I don't think you're crazy.

677
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,000
Okay?

678
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,500
You talked to him too, John.

679
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,800
You know...

680
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,800
I've been lying awake at night.

681
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,500
I feel...

682
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,600
like I'm sleeping...

683
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,200
but I'm awake.

684
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,600
That's when I hear him.

685
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,200
And lately, when I hear him...

686
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,000
all at once...

687
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,500
I understand.

688
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,000
Everything.

689
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,800
John, do you remember
the last time you were happy?

690
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,900
It's real.

691
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,900
These things are real.

692
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,700
I want you to be happy.

693
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,900
Yeah?

694
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,200
What?

695
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,200
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.

696
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,700
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.

697
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,800
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

698
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,600
I can't believe I got through.

699
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
Gordon, where are you, man?

700
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,400
Speak up.

701
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,200
Listen, John, he was right.

702
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,600
Mr. Cold was right
about everything.

703
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:39,000
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.

704
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
He was right about understanding.

705
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,800
It's real, John.
I want you to know.

706
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,100
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?

707
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,500
You've got nothing to worry about.

708
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,500
I'll see you in time.

709
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,600
Gordon?

710
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,600
Can they tell how long
he was out there?

711
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:03,000
Looks like he's been dead
about eight hours.

712
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
He died of exposure.

713
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,500
What made you come out here?

714
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,700
- He called me.
- When?

715
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,400
I didn't like
the way he sounded.

716
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,000
When did he call you, John?

717
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,600
About an hour ago.

718
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,700
I can't stand this.

719
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,100
It didn't seem right
to bring this up at the funeral...

720
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,600
but as far as I know there's never been
any accidents at the chemical plant.

721
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,300
I don't know
what you're talking about.

722
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:34,400
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.

723
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,400
Don't you remember
leaving me that message?

724
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,000
Chief, this is John Klein.

725
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,300
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.

726
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,200
I analyzed both tapes
with the voice print.

727
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,700
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.

728
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,200
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.

729
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,700
I would swear in a court of law
that that's your voice.

730
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,800
Yeah, great. Thanks.

731
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,500
Shit!

732
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,900
Regular coffee to go, please.

733
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,700
Seventy-five cents.

734
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,800
Have a great day.

735
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,500
Do you know that woman?

736
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,900
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?

737
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
- No.
- That's strange.

738
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,500
She had long red hair, green eyes, real
pretty, and she was asking about you.

739
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,500
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.

740
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,300
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.

741
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,800
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.

742
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.

743
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,500
- Did she give you any?
- No.

744
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,000
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for
ruining everything", and then she left.

745
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,700
What's wrong?

746
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Was it her?

747
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,100
Was it her?

748
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,500
That's your wife?

749
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,600
It was her.

750
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,200
- I'm not sure.
- What?

751
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,900
I mean, the hair is different.

752
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,200
- Oh, come on!
- What?

753
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,800
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.

754
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,400
Now, I agree
there is a similarity...

755
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,800
Bullshit!

756
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,000
John, it's all right.

757
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,000
I'm not all right.

758
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,000
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.

759
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,600
Don't you do this to me.

760
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,100
I'm sorry, John.

761
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,600
I feel like
I've ruined everything.

762
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,400
I feel like
I've ruined everything.

763
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,900
I'm so sorry.

764
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,900
I need to know
what happened to you.

765
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,700
Please.

766
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,200
Come in.

767
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:36,600
I was a physics professor
at Cornell.

768
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,400
Tenured.
You can look me up.

769
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,300
One day
I started hearing voices.

770
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,700
The voices became messages.

771
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,800
Before long, I was fully convinced
that I was receiving...

772
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,800
predictions of disaster
from outside intelligences.

773
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,300
But you were, weren't you?

774
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,800
John, I had tapes
of their voices.

775
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,700
I knew a building was going to blow up,
and I tried to prevent it...

776
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,000
but no one listened.

777
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,500
What happened?

778
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,900
People died.

779
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,900
Many people died.

780
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,300
I was investigated,
almost arrested.

781
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,900
My wife divorced me.

782
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,400
My kids...

783
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,700
stopped speaking to me.

784
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,800
Do you know what four years in
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?

785
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,700
Everything...

786
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,600
gone.

787
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:51,100
Oh, you'll never understand
their messages.

788
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,400
You'll misinterpret them.

789
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,200
I did.
It almost destroyed me.

790
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,400
In the end,
it all came down to just...

791
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,500
one simple question.

792
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,900
Which was more important...

793
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,000
having proof...

794
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
or being alive?

795
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,200
Trust me.

796
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,100
I turned away years ago...

797
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,400
and I've never looked back.

798
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,900
Didn't you need to know?

799
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,700
We're not allowed to know.

800
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,800
It's me, Cyrus.

801
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,900
John, is that you?

802
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,600
Yeah.

803
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,800
Yeah, it's me.

804
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:27,200
Whatever you are doing,
you drop it.

805
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,200
Governor McCallum
is going to Charleston.

806
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,200
Then he's touring that chemical plant
in Point Pleasant today.

807
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,100
Now, I want you to go down there...

808
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,400
and meet him at the airport.

809
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,800
You listening?

810
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,400
Yeah, McCall um
at the chemical plant. Got it.

811
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,300
I need to know that
you're gonna be there.

812
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,300
John, are you there?

813
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,200
Ohio.

814
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:12,100
Great tragedy
on the River Ohio.

815
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:18,500
Great tragedy
on the River Ohio.

816
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,200
I can't call in sick just because
you have a bad feeling about today.

817
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:31,300
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.

818
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,400
They show up
over the chemical plant.

819
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,600
Josh gets a call from me,
but it's not really me.

820
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:40,100
I'm talking about something bad
happening at the chemical plant.

821
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:43,100
Then I get this message
from this Indrid Cold...

822
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,800
who's talking about
a great tragedy on the Ohio River.

823
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,300
Guess what's on the Ohio River.

824
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,900
The chemical plant.

825
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,300
Today Governor McCallum
is gonna be there.

826
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,200
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...

827
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,300
That's how I ended up here.

828
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,500
My God.

829
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,700
That's why I'm here.

830
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,800
He was right.

831
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
Who was right?

832
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,100
You saw Leek.

833
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,300
- He was part of the warning.
- What?

834
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:29,400
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.

835
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,800
I didn't want to scare you.

836
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,700
He said...

837
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,800
He said the messages are real.

838
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,900
Something terrible
is gonna happen.

839
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,600
Connie, please.

840
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,900
We have to leave here now.

841
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,900
I will not live
my life like that.

842
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:58,300
I will not make decisions based
on messages from Indrid Cold.

843
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,200
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.

844
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,800
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.

845
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,900
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.

846
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,900
I don't want you anywhere
near the plant today.

847
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,400
What if nothing happens?

848
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:15,700
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?

849
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,900
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.

850
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,300
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!

851
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,900
I know what's gonna happen.

852
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,500
You have to leave now.

853
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,300
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.

854
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,100
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.

855
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,600
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.

856
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,000
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.

857
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:17,800
You can't do it. You can't go.

858
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,900
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.

859
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,400
Cancel it. Make them
shut down the plant now.

860
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,400
The plant's gonna blow up
while you're there.

861
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,300
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?

862
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,500
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.

863
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,800
Have you received a bomb threat?

864
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:39,100
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.

865
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,600
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.

866
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,200
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.

867
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,400
Our top story takes us tonight
to Point Pleasant...

868
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,400
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!

869
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,500
toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.

870
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,000
In what he's called
a successful review...

871
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,600
Governor McCallum has given
high marks to this petrochemical plant.

872
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,600
He is expected to call
for similar renovations...

873
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,800
at several Virginia plants.

874
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,200
WOWK-TV 13...

875
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,800
has an exclusive look inside
at what the governor saw.

876
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,300
Son of a bitch.

877
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,800
I congratulate my friends
at Edgewater Petrochemical...

878
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:32,200
on a job well done.

879
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,000
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.

880
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,000
You have a message.

881
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,700
Come in.

882
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,500
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.

883
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,900
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.

884
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,600
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.

885
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,000
I got a message.

886
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:35,100
I have to go home.

887
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,300
I have to be there noon
on Friday.

888
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,600
John, do you realize
what's happening to you?

889
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,600
I have to go.

890
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,100
Hey, it's me.

891
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,600
- Connie?
- Yeah.

892
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:21,400
I thought we could chat
for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.

893
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,600
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No, you can't.

894
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,500
- I booked you a flight.
- What?

895
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,500
It leaves Dulles
for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.

896
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:44,200
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.

897
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,800
So if you leave now,
you'll just make it.

898
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,500
I can't.

899
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,000
It's Christmas Eve, John.

900
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,100
You shouldn't be alone.

901
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:01,900
I can't.

902
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,900
Yeah, you can.

903
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,400
You know...

904
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,200
when Mary got sick...

905
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,400
I couldn't help thinking...

906
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,400
this isn't real.

907
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,700
I can stop this.

908
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,200
I know I can.
I can stop this.

909
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,700
No one can stop it, John.

910
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,700
Listen to me.

911
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,500
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.

912
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,900
People you know and love
are going to die...

913
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,300
and no matter what
that voice tells you...

914
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,700
there's nothing
you can do about it.

915
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,500
It's two years to the day.

916
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,700
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.

917
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,000
He's lying.

918
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:58,400
Whoever calls
may sound like her...

919
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,600
but it's not gonna be her.

920
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,300
I don't know what happens to us
after we die...

921
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,000
but I'll bet you
wherever Mary is now...

922
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,700
she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.

923
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,900
What if it is her?

924
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:21,200
She's dead, John.

925
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:27,400
The only important question now is
how do you want to remember her?

926
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,800
I miss her so much.

927
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,600
I know you do.
Of course you do.

928
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,600
But, John, listen...

929
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,700
you can miss her here
just as easily as there.

930
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,200
Even more easily because there,
you're all alone.

931
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:51,000
And that's just no way to be.

932
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,300
You do whatever you need to do...

933
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,300
and I'll understand.

934
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,800
But here,
we have dinner at 6:00...

935
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,200
and we open presents at 8:00.

936
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,400
And we hope we see you.

937
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,300
Okay?

938
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,800
Bye, John.

939
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,300
WJMP time is 5:51
on this chilly Christmas Eve.

940
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,200
Come on.

941
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:50,300
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.

942
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,900
Shit.

943
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,400
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

944
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,600
My God.

945
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,800
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!

946
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,600
Get off! Everyone get out
of your cars and get off!

947
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,500
C.J., come on!

948
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,900
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.

949
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:54,100
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!

950
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,100
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!

951
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,900
Get off!
Get off the bridge!

952
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,700
Oh, God!

953
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,000
Go!

954
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,900
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!

955
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,300
Quick!

956
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:16,600
Let's get out!

957
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,700
Get out!

958
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,300
Get out!

959
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,100
Come on. Get out.

960
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,400
All units, this is unit 64.

961
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,400
Get out!

962
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:16,600
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.

963
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,700
Rose, do you copy?

964
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:53,000
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...

965
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,900
Wake up. Wake up.

966
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:36,400
Here we go.

967
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,900
You are here.

968
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,600
I didn't know
if I was dreaming or...

969
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,900
I left DC right after you called.

970
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,000
You did call me, right?

971
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,100
Yeah.

972
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:41,100
Yeah, I called.

973
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,900
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

974
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:53,300
But I supposed
it could've been a lot worse.

975
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:58,800
Are they done with the search?

976
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,500
Thirty-six.

977
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:05,100
Looks like about 36 people.

978
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:07,300
Jesus.

979
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,500
Thirty-six?

980
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,100
Thirty-six?

981
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:34,200
Wake up, number 37.
