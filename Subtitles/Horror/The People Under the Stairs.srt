1
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,560
(girl) Swords and staves.

2
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,470
Tough road you got this year.

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,779
Judgement... Death...

4
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:56,830
..and Mr Devil.

5
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,319
I'm glad it's your birthday reading
and not mine.

6
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,610
Now here's your card, Fool. See?

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,199
- That's where I got your nickname.
- (boy) Don't remind me!

8
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,239
Here you go. 13 today.

9
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,760
The golden-haired birthday boy is
settin' off on life's big adventure.

10
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,260
I ain't no golden-haired nobody!
All I'm goin' on to is seventh grade.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,860
Well, you're the Fool, and you
can't escape that. That ain't bad.

12
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,330
- No?
- No. Ain't the stupid kind of fool.

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,010
The ignorant kind,
cos you're just startin' out.

14
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,440
That's better, I guess.

15
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,370
Ah, but look here.
Already he's got a problem, see?

16
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,319
One step in front - the drop-off.

17
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:40,739
- What about the dog?
- That's Fool's companion.

18
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,010
See his spirit barking?

19
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:46,129
"Fool! Don't go marching
over that cliff, now."

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,199
"Do the smart thing. The high thing."

21
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,900
So what Fool gonna do if he ain't
gonna go off the cliff? Fly?

22
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:55,370
He gonna do what he have to, Fool.

23
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:59,190
Turn around and walk the other way,
right through the fire of the sun.

24
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,379
He'll get burned up if he do that.

25
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,949
Just the boy part get burned up.

26
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,709
The rest come out the other side a man.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,690
And no one calls him "Fool" again.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,429
(woman coughing)

29
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:18,669
(girl) Just try to sleep, Mama.
There's nothing you can do.

30
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,619
- Sh.
- (coughing)

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,970
Sh.

32
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,619
Just rest, Mom.

33
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,630
Oh. (coughs)

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,570
I don't know what to do with this, Ruby.

35
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:40,750
I didn't think the landlord would do this.

36
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:43,839
Not now.

37
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:47,600
- Fool, you shouldn't be here.
- Fool, go back to reading your book.

38
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,619
- What's wrong?
- Nothing you can do. Go on.

39
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,380
(lighter clicks)

40
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,440
Who are you?

41
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,440
Leroy. A friend of Ruby's.

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,699
You the little brother she call Fool?

43
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,220
My real name's Poindexter,
but Ruby's hung up on them tarot cards.

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,869
Why Mama cryin'?

45
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:40,399
Y'all been evicted. You gotta
be out tomorrow at midnight.

46
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,559
I guess Ruby didn't see
that one in the cards.

47
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,929
But why?

48
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,259
You're three days late
with your payment.

49
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,910
The fine print in the lease says
you gotta pay triple or else get out.

50
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,309
Your mama and Ruby ain't got triple.

51
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,479
Well, don't the landlord know that...
that Mama's sick,...

52
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,199
-..or Ruby got babies?
- Yeah, sure. He knows. He don't care.

53
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,929
He wants to tear down the building.
You're the last family in it.

54
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,649
You got some money you can kick in?

55
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,429
I know where you can earn some.

56
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,670
You game?

57
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,779
One last family in the Lenox Avenue
building, then it's clear to tear down.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
We build a nice neat condominium,
we get clean people in there.

59
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,380
Lots of nice wood for my fireplace,
lots of nice...

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,029
- Money.
- And money.

61
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,279
For me.

62
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:01,450
Mama, what happens to the people
when you make them leave their home?

63
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:03,980
I don't believe I was speaking to you.

64
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,839
Speak when spoken to,
that's what good girls do.

65
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,660
- You getting them out soon?
- By tomorrow midnight.

66
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,869
Damn buckshot.

67
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,959
(man #1) Hey, Fool. I hear
you're gettin' evicted, man.

68
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,190
(man #2) Your ass will be out on
the street like the rest of us!

69
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,899
Hey, come back here!

70
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,029
(savage barking)

71
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,790
Hi, Fool.

72
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,929
(Ruby) He don't need that kind
of opportunity. He's a good kid.

73
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,309
He'd do better than the rest of you.
Out of seven, three's already dead.

74
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:26,179
Then there's you, baby,
turnin' tricks on the strip.

75
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:29,630
Willy's a crack addict,
and what's the other one's name, in jail?

76
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:34,070
- Washington. And he didn't do nothin'.
- He tried to put food on the damn table.

77
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,670
That's what I'm tryin'
to teach the boy to do.

78
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,910
- He wants to be a doctor.
- You can't even afford to pay rent!

79
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,149
How are you gonna afford
to send him to medical school?

80
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,910
- It ain't right anyway.
- Oh, that right?

81
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,470
Your mama got a cancer in her
she can't afford to have taken out.

82
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,260
Leroy!

83
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,570
A thing any doctor could
take out just like that.

84
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,140
But you ain't got no money! And you
ain't gonna have no money unless...

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,470
Ow! You little snot!

86
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,760
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

87
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,260
You listen up, you little punk. Listen up!

88
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,450
Now, this is the big one,
and somebody deserve to be robbed,...

89
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:12,579
..somebody who don't care about families
or the neighborhood.

90
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:17,649
He just wanna bring the wreckin' ball in
so he can line his pockets.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,019
Who you talkin' about?

92
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,250
The landlord, that's who.

93
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,899
- The landlord of this building?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:31,239
I found the treasure map last night
in the liquor store, me and Spenser.

95
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,410
A letter addressed to the owner,
along with the name of his company.

96
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,450
- So?
- So the name of the company...

97
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,839
..is the same as the name
on your eviction notice.

98
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,220
Same guy who owns the liquor store
owns half the buildings in the ghetto.

99
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,369
I know where your landlord lives.

100
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,899
No.

101
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,790
Leave him alone. I heard things about him.

102
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,290
- Bad things.
- You heard about the gold?

103
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,670
This is from the company that wants to
buy the coins the landlord collected.

104
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:13,089
- Gold coins.
- You wanna be stupid, Leroy,...

105
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,230
-..you don't need Fool for that.
- We got a plan for him, baby.

106
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,149
Foolproof.

107
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,700
Or you want your family
eatin' beans out in the street?

108
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,159
One day I'm gonna buy you
a Cadillac for each foot, Mama.

109
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,840
And you're gonna skate
around town lookin' so bad.

110
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,599
Just take care of the kids, Dexter.

111
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,960
You the man of the house now.

112
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,140
I'm tryin', Mama.

113
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,979
I'm tryin'.

114
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,030
(coughs)

115
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,539
You didn't lick this, did you?

116
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,599
No, ma'am.

117
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,000
Stand up.

118
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,859
I hope this fits. I worked all day.

119
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,409
Turn around. Stand still.

120
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,770
- Do you love your mother?
- Yes, ma'am.

121
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,530
"Yes, ma'am" what?

122
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,830
Yes, ma'am, I love you, Mother.

123
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,380
Good girl.

124
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,880
Where's your fork?

125
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,549
- Fork?
- I gave you a fork with this.

126
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,789
Where is your fork?

127
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,940
Well, it must have fallen... somewhere.

128
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,080
- On the floor, maybe.
- You don't know?

129
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,830
No, I'm sure it's on the floor.
I mean, I know I dropped it.

130
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,570
You know the punishment
for losing silverware.

131
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:37,219
I'm sure it's right here.

132
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,719
I knew it was there.

133
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,469
Some niggers robbed the store.

134
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:56,450
Again? May they burn in hell.

135
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,229
I'm very tense from this.

136
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:04,929
- You have one of your headaches?
- Ooh.

137
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm very, very tense about this.

138
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,169
Alice has been bad.

139
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,690
She's been feeding that thing
between the walls again.

140
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,070
- No...
- (wailing)

141
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,010
Remember not to bruise her face.

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,539
Bad girls... burn in hell.

143
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,059
(Leroy) There.

144
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,159
- (man) Jesus. It goes on forever.
- No bars on the windows.

145
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,859
No car in the driveway.
Maybe we lucked out. Where's Fool?

146
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,599
He's goin' in. Takin' it cool.

147
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,619
May I help you?

148
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:25,929
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'd like to show
you some of these cookies we're selling.

149
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:30,349
I'm sorry. We watch what we eat
very carefully here.

150
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:34,530
I know it's a bother,
but so is... cerebral palsy.

151
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,489
- And if we don't do all we can...
- I'm sorry.

152
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,609
Well, do you have, like,
a bathroom I could use?

153
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:44,409
They leave us out here all day
without anywhere to take a leak.

154
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,169
- Sorry. Run along.
- That's all right.

155
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,830
No. Run along.

156
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,700
That's OK.

157
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,890
Heavy wire screens on the back windows.

158
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,799
- They been hit before, you think?
- No, probably just the neighborhood.

159
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,340
- How are the screens held on?
- Padlocks on the outside.

160
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:14,809
Padlocks on the outside?
Jeez. What else?

161
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:19,229
- Any alarms?
- I don't know. She wouldn't let me in.

162
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,080
- I told you to tell her you gotta piss.
- She wasn't buyin' that.

163
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,330
- I wanna take a look.
- Don't be stupid, Spenser.

164
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,809
The kid told us all there was to see.

165
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:35,890
- We go in Sunday as planned.
- What if they got an alarm to the police?

166
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,099
I'm not going in Sunday
without checking out the security.

167
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,739
Just look at the doors... the basement,
maybe the connector boxes.

168
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,440
How the hell are you gonna get in? She
wouldn't even let him up on the porch.

169
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,859
You send a boy to do a man's job,
that's what you get.

170
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,950
Anyway, if you thought the Bear Scout
disguise was good, watch this.

171
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,539
- Help you?
- Gas company, ma'am.

172
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:21,239
Got an emergency. Got an emergency.
I need to check your meter.

173
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,830
You passed it on your way up the drive.

174
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:28,039
Oh, that one we've already got. There's
one inside the house I need to check.

175
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,369
There's none in the house.
I'm quite sure of that.

176
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,659
You're probably not even aware of it,
ma'am, but it's on the list.

177
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:38,400
We got a leak on the block,
and it could be very dangerous.

178
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,000
Identification?

179
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:46,309
We do have a legal right to come in,
even if we do have to call the police.

180
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,049
Not that we ever have.

181
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:58,210
It's just there have been
a lot of robberies lately.

182
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,599
The neighborhood's changing.
It has us all a bit on edge.

183
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:03,799
I completely understand.

184
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:07,869
Better this little bother than
a chance of danger, though, right?

185
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,429
(Fool) I don't know how he got past
that woman. She's got x-ray eyeballs.

186
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,669
(Leroy) Spenser's as slippery as a snake.

187
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,559
- I think he's up to somethin'.
- Somethin' like what?

188
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,270
Like grabbin' that coin collection
for himself and cuttin' me out.

189
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:30,450
Cuttin' us out. Spenser mess with you,
he gotta deal with me, too.

190
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,190
You somethin', Fool.

191
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:47,190
- She leave him alone? You're kiddin'.
- There has to be someone else in there.

192
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,409
Old folks, kids or something.

193
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,500
Maybe Spenser should stick
his ugly head out and give us a signal.

194
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,750
Maybe he lookin' around a little bit,
to make sure it's safe.

195
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,210
Maybe the president is gonna
make me Secretary of Pussy.

196
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,800
Now, he's probably in there
hiding the best for himself.

197
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,219
Come on. We're goin' in.

198
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,920
Spenser said we gotta
stay out here, Leroy.

199
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,140
So he can get
all the good shit for himself?

200
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,219
Why not throw your mom out in
the street along with Ruby and the kids?

201
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,969
See?

202
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,859
(grunts) They in Fort Knox or what?

203
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,069
Listen, Leroy. This breakin'
and enterin' might not be so smart.

204
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,160
I mean, it's the first day
of my 13th birthday.

205
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,140
- Could be unlucky.
- 13th birthday is unlucky anyway.

206
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,130
Too old to get tit, too young to get ass.
You're fucked either way.

207
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,660
Lord, now look at this.

208
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,650
The mother of all doors.

209
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,439
They ain't messin' around.

210
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,449
Spenser.

211
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,430
Spenser!

212
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,920
(squeaking)

213
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,369
Uh, so, Leroy,...

214
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,989
..you think I got what it takes
to be a doctor?

215
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,680
Doctor of burglary, maybe.

216
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,030
You're lucky
I'm teachin' you a trade, kid.

217
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,520
Ain't no door stands up to Leroy.

218
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,810
I done busted this house's cherry.

219
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,560
It's opened right up now.

220
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:45,319
Get off him!

221
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,750
Leroy!

222
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,989
Hey, fuzzball!
Your mother sleeps with cats!

223
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,209
Run, Fool!

224
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,239
That's one mean motherfucker.
You see that?

225
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:12,040
- He came at me like an airplane.
- I saw him all right.

226
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,229
He gone?

227
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:24,790
He's waitin' right there.

228
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,979
Been trained to wait there, probably.

229
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,089
He'll stay out there,
and we stay right in here.

230
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,719
(fly buzzing)

231
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,079
This place is weird.

232
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,260
"See no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil."

233
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,680
Every cabinet has a lock on it.

234
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,060
Why do you think they do that?

235
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,510
Somebody need a bath, bad.

236
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,359
(banging)

237
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:08,290
Nice to see the rich folks got rats too.

238
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,530
Listen, Leroy, let's just
get outta here. Out the front.

239
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,739
First we find out what's up
with good old Spenser.

240
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,510
Man, the hell with Spenser.
Let's get outta here.

241
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,030
The hell with those gold coins too, huh?

242
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,689
Maybe you're too stupid for this
kinda work, or maybe too chickenshit.

243
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,040
(scurrying)

244
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,800
Oh, there's that bastard now.

245
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,560
He's upstairs.

246
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,079
We'll surprise him. Come on.

247
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,619
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin'.

248
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,030
(click)

249
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,589
(clock chimes)

250
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,939
I don't think
we should go up there, Leroy.

251
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,550
Oh, that's fine, girlfriend.

252
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,930
I tell you what. You stay down here,
and you keep an eye out.

253
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,989
You think you can do that?
(blows a kiss)

254
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,430
Yeah, I can do that.

255
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:43,260
Man, there's enough room
for ten families in here.

256
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,229
(Leroy) Spenser!
Spenser, are you up here?

257
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,959
(clanking)

258
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,290
(scrabbling)

259
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,420
Spenser!

260
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,890
Spenser, you back in there?

261
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:19,829
(eerie whispering)

262
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:22,050
I ain't stupid.

263
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,260
"Or maybe you're just
too chickenshit for this kinda work."

264
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,619
- (door locks)
- (eerie voice) Fool.

265
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:03,150
Spenser?

266
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,020
Spenser?

267
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,979
(man) How can you say that of me?
I've never been unfaithful to you.

268
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,699
(woman) I'm not talking
about another woman, John.

269
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:17,260
- What's that supposed to mean?
- connect the dots, John.

270
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,479
Everyone else has. Ever since Paris.
Ever since Cybill killed herself

271
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,699
(man) Cybill's death
was a sailing accident.

272
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:29,410
- That's what I am - a survivor.
- Tiffany!

273
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,140
I'm sorry, John. Sorry for the both of us.
Sorry for the child that... we never had.

274
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,709
- And never will!
- Tiffany, don't get...

275
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,170
(gunfire)

276
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,339
Now the anti-aircraft battery!
They're firing.

277
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:48,530
- Where?
- I think it's the barracks.

278
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,469
They're over by the barracks.

279
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:56,209
We can hear the staccato firing, and now
here it comes. Baghdad is lighting up!

280
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,719
Tracers flaring up like... like
angry hornets from every rooftop now.

281
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,000
We cannot see the bombers, but the fire
of their munitions is shaking the city.

282
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,079
It's shaking our hotel. Oh, look! See it?

283
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,670
There! Right over there,
flying just over the rooftops.

284
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:16,030
Spenser, you back in there?

285
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,209
(bang)

286
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,790
(eerie voice) No!

287
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:40,400
(groaning)

288
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,670
Spenser!

289
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,180
(groaning)

290
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:24,199
You can't do that,
you miserable stinkin' thing!

291
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,560
(gibbering)

292
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,849
Come on, Spense.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

293
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:44,280
Man... this ain't right.

294
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,619
Who are you?

295
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,219
Leroy, we gotta get outta this place!

296
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,280
(gibbering)

297
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:29,270
(groaning)

298
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,300
Hello? Miss?

299
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,839
Leroy. Leroy!

300
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:00,170
Leroy?

301
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,349
- Leroy?
- Jesus!

302
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,290
- You scared the shit outta me.
- I thought you were dead!

303
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,449
- You was just layin' there.
- A man ain't dead...

304
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,729
..just cos he's layin' on the floor.

305
00:31:23,189 --> 00:31:25,380
I was listenin'. Something's in there.

306
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:29,699
As a matter of fact, why don't you
crawl in there and see what it is?

307
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,569
Turkey-brain! Are you hittin' on me
like I'm here to save your ass?

308
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:36,969
You're gonna stick your dumb head
in there and lose it, like Spenser!

309
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:40,619
- What kinda shit you talkin'?
- I'm talkin' we gotta get outta here.

310
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,349
The x-ray lady's back.
She's out back right now by the van.

311
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,959
She got a man with her
the size of Detroit!

312
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,859
Damn. You seen Spenser?

313
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,969
- I seen Spenser all right.
- He find anything?

314
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:55,160
Somethin' found him. He's dead, Leroy.

315
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:58,619
I think scared to death.

316
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,239
- You sure?
- You thought he was white before?

317
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,969
You should see that sucker now!

318
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,060
There is somebody in there.
The door's been pried.

319
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,040
- I told you there'd be another one.
- Out the front.

320
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,060
Wah!

321
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,189
Oh, shit!

322
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,339
Oh, my hand!

323
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,829
(woman) Pry it open at the bottom,
enough so Prince can get in.

324
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,359
(snarling)

325
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,400
- Come on, Fool!
- Agh! What are you doin'?

326
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,680
Stay here in the open
so the fuckin' dog can see you.

327
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,560
You think I'm crazy? He's got teeth
he ain't even used yet!

328
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,010
Do like I say,
or I'm gonna take your head off.

329
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:05,699
I'm gonna nail that sucker, don't worry.

330
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:08,579
- I'm worryin'.
- (barking)

331
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,900
(man) Kill him!

332
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,699
Uh-oh.

333
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,609
- Where'd he go?
- (growls)

334
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,859
Shit!

335
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,520
- Leroy!
- What the hell are you doin', Fool?!

336
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,530
Come on!

337
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,219
I'm gonna take your fuckin' head off!

338
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,680
(woman) I heard him yell!
I heard him go down!

339
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:14,350
- I told you, don't mess with me.
- Man, that saved your body.

340
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,870
- Are these people crazy or what?
- You ask 'em!

341
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,570
Get in there, Daddy!
Get in there and get 'em!

342
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,570
Make it safe for Mommy!

343
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,340
Ow! Damn!

344
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,800
Little doggy baby! Someone is in here.

345
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,439
The people under the stairs
got the so-called gasman.

346
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,969
- The other one must be upstairs.
- Princey... Daddy'll get him.

347
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:10,360
That's a big-caliber automatic.
Did you ever see the holes they tear?

348
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:14,889
- We can hide under the bed.
- I ain't goin' in there, man.

349
00:35:16,629 --> 00:35:18,469
No room. Find your own.

350
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,639
- (banging)
- (locks clicking)

351
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,459
Aha!

352
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,620
Run, Fool!

353
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,379
Fool... Yee-ha!

354
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:26,669
Got him! (laughs)

355
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,280
Oh, Daddy!

356
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,530
- See that? He came at me like a bull.
- Just like a bull!

357
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,209
A big one!

358
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,870
- Did you hear what he called me?
- He called you a fool.

359
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,679
(man) He's the fool!

360
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:45,790
(woman) The only good fool's a dead one.

361
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,860
- (woman) Upstairs might be a mess.
- I don't want a mess. I better go look.

362
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:58,620
We might have to mop up a little.

363
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:16,510
Thought I heard something. Stay there.

364
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:09,110
Get back in the cellar, you little bastard.

365
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:21,330
(echoing) You little animal shit!
I get the dog up here, you'll be sorry.

366
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,860
(creaking)

367
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,350
My... my name is Fool.

368
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,060
- What's yours?
- Alice.

369
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,360
Don't be scared. You...
you never seen a brother before?

370
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,270
- I never had a brother.
- No, I mean a black dude.

371
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,439
There's black folks
in the neighborhood.

372
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:21,909
Neighborhood?

373
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,280
The neighborhood.

374
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:27,409
You know, outside?

375
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,790
Well, that's outside, not in here.

376
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,649
So you get outside, don't you?

377
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:39,949
- Are... are you sayin' never?
- Can't get out. No one ever has.

378
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,739
Well... well, I'm gonna get out.

379
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:46,580
I'm a whole other thing.

380
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:51,620
People have tried.

381
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:56,479
You... you mean
the... the people in the cellar?

382
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,760
Who are they?

383
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,959
Mommy and Daddy looked a long time
to find the perfect boy child.

384
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,810
But each one they found turned out bad.

385
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,550
Some saw things
they weren't supposed to.

386
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,689
Others heard too much,
others talked back.

387
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,959
Daddy cut out the bad parts
and put the boys in the cellar,...

388
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,360
..one by one.

389
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:32,370
When they get flashlights
and food of some kind,...

390
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:34,989
..they're happy in their own way.

391
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,520
Yeah, right.

392
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,909
(bolts door)

393
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,830
What about you?

394
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:49,489
How come they haven't
put you in the cellar?

395
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:55,370
I do not see, or hear, or speak evil.

396
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:04,110
It's the only way.

397
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:08,649
(agonized yelling)

398
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:13,639
- What is that?
- What?

399
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,750
- That yellin'. What is that?
- Well, that's Roach.

400
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,629
- Roach?
- That's who Daddy's hunting.

401
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:23,570
See, Daddy hates Roach cos he got
out of the cellar and into the walls.

402
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,409
And Daddy can't find him.

403
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,739
(Roach yelling)

404
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:46,120
- There must be another way out.
- Further into the house. Here.

405
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,790
Father's too big to follow,
and he's afraid of what's in there.

406
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:53,699
- I don't want in, I want out.
- Sometimes in is out.

407
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,560
(Roach yells)

408
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,310
Forget it.

409
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:04,699
(Roach laughs)

410
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,489
(man) I hear ya! I hear ya!

411
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:16,209
(gunshot)

412
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,010
Yes.

413
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,860
- OK, I'll get in there.
- (gunshot)

414
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:30,979
(gunshot)

415
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,629
(taunting laughter)

416
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:51,709
(man) I'm gonna get ya!

417
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,010
- (gunshot)
- Yes!

418
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,889
(laughter)

419
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:03,219
I've got something for my Princey. Yes!

420
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:05,830
Come on. Come on. Come on.

421
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:09,429
Good appetite.

422
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:13,050
Healthy Prince... a secure home.

423
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:17,290
(tires squeal)

424
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,379
Stay.

425
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,639
(radio) The vehicle registration matches
that of a van used in a 211 last night.

426
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,229
Daddy. Police out back.

427
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,310
Damn.

428
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:52,989
(growls)

429
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,760
Hey, police! Police!

430
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,850
Police! Police!

431
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:15,250
Hello. What can I do for you, gentlemen?

432
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:17,659
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Is this your van?

433
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:22,100
Goodness, no. It was just standing here
when we got back from shopping.

434
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:25,169
- Did you see anybody around?
- Trouble?

435
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:28,639
Well, as a matter of fact
we did see a couple of men -

436
00:44:28,889 --> 00:44:30,669
one black, one white -

437
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:33,360
walking away as we approached.

438
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:35,709
We thought they were
service people of some sort.

439
00:44:36,149 --> 00:44:38,780
- They were working on your door.
- No harm done.

440
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:41,629
- We'll check the house.
- Just checked it.

441
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:44,620
Even looked under the beds.
Clean as a whistle.

442
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:47,100
Well, let's recon the neighborhood.

443
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,570
- Do you get a lot of this?
- It's as if we're the prisoners,...

444
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,820
-..and the criminals roam free.
- I know what you mean.

445
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,979
You're lucky. This van was used
in a liquor-store robbery last night.

446
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,310
- Oh, goodness.
- Liquor store?

447
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,959
I'd advise you to stay inside,
keep your doors locked for a while.

448
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,790
You can count on it.

449
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,040
Hope you catch 'em.

450
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,429
- Catch 'em in hell.
- Oh, my God.

451
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:23,560
- What?
- There's not just the two.

452
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:30,209
There's a boy.

453
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,810
He's in there right now...

454
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:36,360
..with our little angel!

455
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,699
(snarls)

456
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,260
God! What are they feedin' you?

457
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:29,320
(man) What is it, boy?

458
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,050
(man groans)

459
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,840
You come in here
and I'm gonna kick your ass!

460
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:17,419
Gonna kill you!

461
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,050
Kill.

462
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:29,689
Kill them!

463
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,060
(boy grunts)

464
00:47:43,709 --> 00:47:45,610
(grunts)

465
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:55,459
Is this your place?

466
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,919
(snarls)

467
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,590
- What hit you?
- The damn Bear Trooper.

468
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,600
But Prince is after him.
He'll kill him before he gets to Alice.

469
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:24,800
Let's do somethin'!

470
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:34,110
(laughs hysterically)

471
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:36,399
(howling)

472
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,399
Do you hear something?

473
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,070
The boy's gotten to Alice.

474
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,919
Thanks.

475
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:19,159
He doesn't talk much, does he?

476
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:22,189
His... his tongue's cut out.

477
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,840
(whispers) Oh, man!

478
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:31,449
My mother caught him trying to
call for help one day, and...

479
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,090
-..Daddy had to teach him...
- Speak no evil, right?

480
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:40,620
Your father's one sick mother,
you know that?

481
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:43,860
Actually, your mother's
one sick mother, too.

482
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:46,070
Sh!

483
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:50,270
You're speaking evil. They'd kill you
if they heard a word you just said.

484
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:56,679
Roach. Roach is my friend.

485
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,840
Roach?

486
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,280
I'm Poindexter. Everybody calls me Fool.

487
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,149
Fool?

488
00:50:07,979 --> 00:50:10,149
We sure got the names, huh?

489
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,070
Is this Leroy?

490
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,689
You did this? Why do you make these?

491
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,090
To hold the souls
of burglars when they died.

492
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,419
Or salesmen, workmen...
other people who saw too much.

493
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,800
There she is!

494
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,100
You viper in my bosom!

495
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,189
- You little Judas!
- What do I do with him, Mommy?

496
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,439
It is time to clean house!

497
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:10,250
Total spring-cleaning.

498
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:14,689
OK, let's move it!
Pull, you little piece of shit!

499
00:51:16,919 --> 00:51:19,060
No, wait a minute!

500
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:38,010
I am sick and tired of your attitude!
You will do your chore now!

501
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,699
Clean it up, for God's sake!

502
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,729
What is a mother to do?

503
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,750
Lazy brat sits in her room
all day, sewing dolls!

504
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,939
Children misbehaving in the basement!

505
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,179
And one in the walls,...

506
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,439
..doing his business God knows where!

507
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,360
You kids'll be the death of me!

508
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:09,750
The death of me.

509
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,469
I keep 'em real hungry.

510
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:47,050
I ask a simple thing -

511
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:52,370
just clean up that awful man's blood -
and what do you do?

512
00:52:53,399 --> 00:52:57,620
You get it all over your nice,
clean dress I worked so hard to make!

513
00:52:58,399 --> 00:53:00,919
Now get in that tub and scrub yourself!

514
00:53:01,409 --> 00:53:03,189
No!

515
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:05,840
Don't wanna get in, huh?
Well, let me help you!

516
00:53:06,409 --> 00:53:08,280
(screams)

517
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:11,100
You scrub yourself!

518
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:15,000
You scrub yourself! It's hot!

519
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:17,610
The fires of hell are hotter!

520
00:53:36,189 --> 00:53:38,239
No! Don't put me in there!

521
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:40,709
No! No!

522
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,479
No!

523
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:57,129
Where's the Bear Trooper?

524
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:03,409
Dead meat.

525
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:09,199
I could've killed him, but I let
the people under the stairs do it.

526
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,570
Leave me alone!

527
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,719
Get away from me!

528
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,610
Roach.

529
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,320
It's right there, Roach.

530
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:13,389
(man) I told you to keep quiet down there!
You're drivin' me nuts!

531
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:14,840
Pull it!

532
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:19,399
Guard 'em, Prince. Guard 'em.

533
00:55:23,129 --> 00:55:25,179
Noisy bastards.

534
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,659
If I have to come down there,
you're gonna be sorry.

535
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,760
Roach, you're shot.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

536
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,340
The coin collection.

537
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,290
Leroy was right.

538
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,479
Thanks, Roach.

539
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:49,709
Alice is up there?

540
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,870
Roach!

541
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,800
Roach...

542
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,879
(barking and snarling)

543
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,520
Get outta here! Go!

544
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:47,919
(man) What did he do to you?
I told you never to talk to anybody!

545
00:57:49,439 --> 00:57:52,570
You hear me? Come here! You answer me!

546
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:54,969
Did you tell him anything?

547
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,090
If you did, you know what I'll do.

548
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,100
I killed your skinny friend in the walls.
Now what do you think of that?

549
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:09,199
Oh, I got him good.
And the black one, too.

550
00:58:09,709 --> 00:58:11,520
(barking)

551
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,669
Shut the fuck up!

552
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:23,310
What the hell's wrong with him?

553
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,489
- He said he killed you.
- He exaggerated.

554
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,860
Come on!

555
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,189
Stay!

556
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,679
Move. If he finds us,
he'll shoot through the walls.

557
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,560
- My dress is stuck on something.
- Oh, great(!)

558
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,530
Uh-oh. You gotta keep goin', Alice.
Come on.

559
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:13,250
Burn in hell for gettin' free,
and burn in hell for showin' the way!

560
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:29,070
Who turned on the heat?

561
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,510
Burn! Burn!

562
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,040
Burn in hell!

563
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,870
Burn!

564
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:52,459
(coughing)

565
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:57,129
Alice, he's comin' closer.
We gotta get outta here.

566
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,729
- Which way?
- Only Roach knew the way.

567
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:33,139
So we'll explore.

568
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:35,429
(cocks gun) Gonna find you!

569
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,030
- I gotta sneeze.
- Gonna kill ya!

570
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:42,879
(sneezes)

571
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,810
Sh! If he can't hear us, he can't shoot us.

572
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:07,449
- We gotta be careful.
- Real careful.

573
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:11,489
- Do you think you got him?
- We'll soon find out. Come on.

574
01:01:11,979 --> 01:01:14,169
Come on. Kill. Kill. Kill.

575
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:17,060
Kill! Kill 'em, Prince. Kill 'em!

576
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:18,780
Kill 'em!

577
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:22,379
Sh! I just heard something.

578
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:26,879
Come on!

579
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,590
I'm not runnin' anymore.

580
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:36,010
Come on!

581
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,699
(screaming)

582
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,689
Alice!

583
01:01:57,939 --> 01:01:59,870
Alice, get back!

584
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:19,810
(Alice) Get away from the wall!
Get away from the wall!

585
01:02:44,689 --> 01:02:46,709
Got ya.

586
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:50,620
Got ya!

587
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,520
Jesus.

588
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,840
I got him! I got him!

589
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:07,760
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I got him, I got him!

590
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:11,290
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I got him, I got him!

591
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:14,060
I got him, I got him, I got him!

592
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,590
Prove it.

593
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,600
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

594
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:25,689
There's light up there. Come on.

595
01:03:37,489 --> 01:03:39,949
I know you're in there,
you little piece of shit.

596
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,530
- (growls)
- Oh, no!

597
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,120
Oh, shit.

598
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:52,219
You killed Prince!

599
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,260
Look. You can see
the lights of the ghetto from here.

600
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:20,639
I never thought
smog could smell so good.

601
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:24,189
- Help!
- Sh!

602
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,770
- We might have to climb down.
- There's nothing to hold on to.

603
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,820
It's just a straight drop off the roof.

604
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,139
- Wait a minute.
- What?

605
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:35,719
The water in the garden.
I think it's right under this window.

606
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,989
If we take a jump off the edge,
we might be able to hit it.

607
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:41,889
- I don't know how deep it is.
- (banging) I hear 'em!

608
01:04:42,409 --> 01:04:45,510
- Alice, come on. We gotta jump!
- I can't! I'm afraid.

609
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,959
You upstairs, Alice?

610
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:49,879
- Alice!
- What's out there?

611
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,969
There he is!

612
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:01,909
What were you doin' with him? Come here.

613
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,169
Alice! Alice!

614
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,199
No! No! No! No!

615
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:22,030
Damn it.

616
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,669
I'll be back, Alice! Hang on!

617
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,810
Bastard!

618
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,510
Never shoot your gun outside!

619
01:05:49,909 --> 01:05:52,459
- He got away.
- Come back inside.

620
01:05:57,679 --> 01:05:59,459
Damn it.

621
01:06:01,469 --> 01:06:03,520
Bad boy! Go on.

622
01:06:07,979 --> 01:06:09,760
Go to your room and get into your suit.

623
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,790
If these had come from anybody else,
I'd make you take 'em straight back.

624
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,760
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

625
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:24,729
Well, figurin' the rarity of these,...

626
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,409
..you do have enough
to pay your rent for a while.

627
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,300
Say, to the year 2OOO.

628
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,739
- And Mama's operation?
- And your mama's operation.

629
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,929
Keep hold of these till tomorrow.

630
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:44,850
I'm gonna order
an ambulance for your mama.

631
01:06:45,379 --> 01:06:49,919
Tomorrow we'll take those to
a good coin dealer, and we'll dll be smilin'.

632
01:06:50,629 --> 01:06:52,770
Meanwhile, you be careful.

633
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:56,729
That brother-sister act you messed with
are evil, plain and simple.

634
01:06:57,489 --> 01:06:59,770
Wait a minute. Brother and sister?

635
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:04,780
Brother and sister. Tail end of
the craziest family you ever heard of.

636
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:08,530
Every generation more insane
than the one before.

637
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:11,919
Started out as a family
runnin' a funeral home,...

638
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:16,070
..sellin' cheap coffins for expensive prices.

639
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,590
Then they got their fingers
into real estate,...

640
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:22,959
..started makin' a lot of money
takin' over people's homes.

641
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,600
The more money they got,
the greedier they got.

642
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,000
The greedier they got,
the crazier they got.

643
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:32,429
All sorts of rumors about
what's gone on in that place.

644
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:37,419
Never proved it because
the police didn't take it serious.

645
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:42,090
But believe me, when I was a kid,
none of us ever walked past that house.

646
01:07:50,479 --> 01:07:52,649
You OK, Fool?

647
01:07:52,909 --> 01:07:56,689
I was just tellin' Mama that
I did somethin' wrong. Real wrong.

648
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:59,909
And now I gotta do somethin' right.

649
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,370
I done the tarot cards on you again.

650
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:06,669
They come up real scary. Don't go
messin' with them people again.

651
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:14,370
Somebody has to.
And maybe that means me.

652
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,250
Anyway, I made a promise to Alice.
And I'm gonna keep it.

653
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,910
- 14th Precinct.
- Hello. Police?

654
01:08:53,569 --> 01:08:54,470
Yes.

655
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:56,740
I'd like to report a case of child abuse.

656
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:59,500
- All right. When did this happen?
- Right now.

657
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:06,600
- Is this real or what?
- Bogus. The place is clean.

658
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,779
The people don't even have kids.
They have coffee, though.

659
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:14,399
(cop) I'm gonna go upstairs
and look around.

660
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,089
- More coffee?
- No, thank you. I've had plenty.

661
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,040
I'm so sorry you all had to come out
at such an hour for such a silly thing.

662
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:41,319
But, you know, it's better
there are a few false calls...

663
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:44,910
..if we can prevent
just one child from being abused.

664
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:48,589
- Mm-hm. Absolutely right.
- Cream and sugar?

665
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:20,790
Nice furniture. You didn't get that stuff
at Price Club, that's for sure.

666
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,870
- It's been in the family for years.
- Yeah?

667
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,180
Used to be the house
was used for, uh... business.

668
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,430
- No kidding?
- Sergeant?

669
01:10:31,209 --> 01:10:33,049
There's something you might wanna see.

670
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:35,290
- What?
- Take a look.

671
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,410
- I thought you said you had no kids.
- Alice left us a long time ago.

672
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:52,470
The Lord saw fit to come and take her.

673
01:10:53,009 --> 01:10:55,229
Never touched the room since.

674
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:00,439
We're foolish, I suppose, but...
in a sense, she still lives here.

675
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:07,910
- And always will.
- My apologies.

676
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,049
It must be very painful for you.

677
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,279
I'm sorry about this.
This should have never happened.

678
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,089
No need to apologize.
We wanna be helpful.

679
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,740
- (woman) Good night, sir.
- (cop) Thanks for the refreshments.

680
01:11:21,259 --> 01:11:22,629
You're welcome.

681
01:11:22,759 --> 01:11:27,040
I don't wanna see
another cop or cookie in my life!

682
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:31,220
I don't know which one makes me sicker.

683
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,799
May they burn in hell.

684
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,910
Forever and ever in hell.

685
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,080
- The shelf worked.
- Yup.

686
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,319
Always does. Simple works best.

687
01:12:02,959 --> 01:12:04,770
Gotta get a new dog tomorrow.

688
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:06,939
A good big one.

689
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:18,370
(woman) I was worried. The police left
the back door open for so long.

690
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:20,870
- So?
- I couldn't watch it all the time.

691
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:24,589
- Think any of 'em got out?
- Nah. They were pretty out of it.

692
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,770
- What'd you use?
- Horse tranquilizers.

693
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:38,450
(man) Tomorrow I'm gonna look
for the Bear Trooper.

694
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:41,060
- Where would you look?
- The ghetto.

695
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:43,879
I'll find him. And I'll kill him.

696
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,129
- Night, Mama.
- Night, Daddy.

697
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,410
- Say your prayers like a good boy.
- Oh! I forgot.

698
01:13:56,029 --> 01:13:58,399
(woman) Now I lay me down to sleep,...

699
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,799
(man) Now I lay me down to sleep,...

700
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,060
(both)..I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

701
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:10,490
If I should kill before I wake,...

702
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:14,270
(woman)..I pray the Lord my soul to take.

703
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:17,339
(man)..I pray the Lord my soul to take.

704
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:32,160
Ah! You miserable little shit!

705
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,220
Shut up!

706
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:44,040
You hurt my baby!

707
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,870
Get him! Get him!

708
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:03,060
- Get him! Get him!
- (yells)

709
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,859
"Downstairs door."

710
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:31,439
- Did you get him?
- He's fast, damn it!

711
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:33,600
Open the kitchen.

712
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,790
Oh, shit!

713
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,669
What happened? Did he get out?

714
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,009
Oh! Burn in hell.

715
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,870
(man) Burn in hell.

716
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,399
(woman) What about Alice?
What'll we do with her?

717
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,310
Let her hang up there all night.

718
01:15:58,069 --> 01:16:02,430
- (woman) She's terrified of the attic.
- I know. It serves her right.

719
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,520
- Alice!
- Fool?

720
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,750
Are you OK?

721
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,410
Can you get any more of these bricks out?

722
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:41,040
- I can't. They've got me stuck.
- How?

723
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,529
I'm tied to a bolt in the chimney.

724
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:47,600
This one?

725
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,870
(banging)

726
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,040
Yes.

727
01:16:57,169 --> 01:16:58,689
- Hi.
- Hi.

728
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:05,490
Let's see if we can get
some more of these bricks out.

729
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,540
Sh! Get down!

730
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,350
Let me down, please.

731
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:37,819
Daddy! Come down from there
and help me to bed!

732
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:40,750
Daddy!

733
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:52,250
I said now!

734
01:17:55,479 --> 01:17:57,560
He's gone. Fool?

735
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,750
Fool?

736
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,080
Meet me at the window.
You know the one.

737
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,359
OK.

738
01:18:07,209 --> 01:18:09,729
- You find him, bring him back to me.
- I will!

739
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,240
I'll take him under the stairs
and do him like the others.

740
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,419
- Only it won't be his ears I cut off.
- His balls!

741
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:20,850
Here, hold this.

742
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:32,870
Listen, Alice. They're not your real parents.

743
01:18:33,339 --> 01:18:35,390
They're not even husband and wife.

744
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,479
They stole you, like they did
Roach and all the others.

745
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,509
They're a bunch of
rotten baby snatchers.

746
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:46,109
- You're just saying that.
- My grandfather Booker told me.

747
01:18:46,879 --> 01:18:49,049
He wouldn't lie to me.

748
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:54,339
What do we do now?

749
01:18:55,589 --> 01:18:57,520
Feel up to a little jump?

750
01:18:57,759 --> 01:19:00,720
The problem is, first thing he did
when you escaped was drain it...

751
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:03,850
..and put broken glass and rocks
in the bottom.

752
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,620
That's a problem.

753
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,720
The way we came up before
he's got fixed now.

754
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:17,279
Look.

755
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:21,709
- (Fool) This place is one big bomb.
- (Alice) He's got 'em all over the house.

756
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,290
- Think you could climb the roof?
- What's up there?

757
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,120
The only way out.

758
01:19:38,919 --> 01:19:42,379
- How dare he come into our home?
- He came back to get Alice!

759
01:19:42,959 --> 01:19:46,500
- You should have let me kill her.
- You stay away from Alice!

760
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:49,979
- She did it with him, I know it.
- Not my little girl!

761
01:19:50,509 --> 01:19:52,500
She's a whore!

762
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,669
(clattering)

763
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:05,979
What is that?

764
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,569
(Fool) Oh, God!

765
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,729
- That hurts so bad!
- (laughs)

766
01:20:28,299 --> 01:20:30,290
See him?

767
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,470
I can't see shit!

768
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,560
Let me see the brick.

769
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,100
Hold it. I think I hear somethin'.

770
01:20:39,979 --> 01:20:40,939
Bombs away.

771
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:42,709
- (rattling)
- No!

772
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:45,430
- (thud)
- Argh!

773
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:48,580
I guess it was one of those smart bricks.

774
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,939
You bastard!

775
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:54,419
Come on. You can do it.
Just brace yourself on the side.

776
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,220
This is it. Hang on.

777
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,399
(screams)

778
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:12,390
The gun!

779
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:32,580
Ca-ca!

780
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:38,279
- Hold it. Do you know where we are?
- Uh-uh.

781
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,720
There's the living room.
Get out the back door.

782
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,330
- Fool, come with me.
- I'm not finished with them yet.

783
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,359
- Fool...
- Go!

784
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,770
I'm gonna get the shotgun,
set those kids free.

785
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,750
(man) I... I will get them.

786
01:22:23,129 --> 01:22:25,089
(boys gibbering)

787
01:22:39,549 --> 01:22:41,220
Sh!

788
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,609
Hold it right there!

789
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,169
Where is that little bastard? Tell me!

790
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:55,640
- Tell me!
- I... I won't tell you.

791
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:58,669
We will get him out of our house!

792
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:03,709
He's filthy! He's bad. He's awful!

793
01:23:09,459 --> 01:23:11,189
Go to hell!

794
01:23:16,549 --> 01:23:17,720
(woman) Eldon!

795
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:22,589
Oh, God! He's turned
my little girl against me!

796
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,140
I told you. Those two...

797
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:30,589
Then she can burn in hell.

798
01:23:32,089 --> 01:23:34,140
Both of them.

799
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:45,580
She doesn't have a key. She's still in here!

800
01:23:59,129 --> 01:24:01,379
(gibbering)

801
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:07,819
- (glass shattering)
- (banging)

802
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,819
- She's in the cellar.
- No way.

803
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:13,799
Then he is.

804
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,009
You know a prayer?

805
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,000
You say it.

806
01:24:33,629 --> 01:24:35,799
Shoot her if you see her.

807
01:24:45,259 --> 01:24:47,339
Come here!

808
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:57,779
See your friends?

809
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,819
- Get him?
- Oh, yeah.

810
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,589
(knocking)

811
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,970
Sh! It may be the police again. Hold on.

812
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:38,680
My name is Ruby. I represent the
Association of People Unjustly Evicted,...

813
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,939
-..Exploited and Generally Fucked Over.
- What?

814
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,919
You and your brother are
landlords of over 5O buildings...

815
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:48,169
..which you allow
to deteriorate into hellholes...

816
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,109
..while you guys get rich
charging ridiculous rents!

817
01:25:51,459 --> 01:25:56,350
Then you evict anyone when they can't
pay so you can tear down their homes.

818
01:25:57,379 --> 01:26:00,129
- Ain't that about right?
- None of your goddamn business!

819
01:26:04,549 --> 01:26:06,660
Kill the little bugger!

820
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,970
Kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

821
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:11,709
(gibbering)

822
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,859
- What the hell is going on?!
- He's loose again! Damn it!

823
01:26:25,189 --> 01:26:28,229
- (knocking)
- (man) Police! Open up!

824
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,250
Sh!

825
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,990
Police! We have reports of gunfire!

826
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,310
If you do not open this door,
we'll break it down!

827
01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:49,180
- Get off my property!
- Just want to finish sayin' our piece.

828
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,870
Not only are you bad landlords
but, ten times worse,...

829
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:57,569
..you've stolen children from
our community for your own sick needs.

830
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:00,529
There's no community here.

831
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:03,770
All I see are a couple of n...

832
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:05,890
(man) Ruby! We're right here.

833
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,509
(woman) We busted your ass, bitch!

834
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,629
What are you gonna do? Shoot us all?

835
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:18,540
- You'll do!
- (Alice) No!

836
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,000
(Ruby) Damn! You knocked that bitch cold!

837
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,540
(man) Look at her!
What they doin' to her in there?

838
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:00,970
Oh, shit.

839
01:28:19,259 --> 01:28:21,430
I know you're in here.

840
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:24,680
You're not gettin' out.

841
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:27,680
Nobody gets out.

842
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,609
(cocks gun) Nobody.

843
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:32,410
Fool!

844
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,990
(Ruby) Fool? That you?

845
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,459
Listen. There's a way out for you guys,
if you can get past the man.

846
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:57,370
The door to the outside cellar
got left open.

847
01:28:57,430 --> 01:29:01,410
There you can get outside.
To the sun, to the birds.

848
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,250
To the women.

849
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,279
You wanna give me something?

850
01:29:22,299 --> 01:29:25,430
A burglar alarm? No problem.
I've studied with the best.

851
01:29:29,589 --> 01:29:31,609
I can use these wires to bridge it.

852
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:36,240
(gibbering)

853
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,990
No wonder there's no money in the ghetto.

854
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,629
Fool?

855
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,540
Fool! Fool!

856
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:21,850
(door slams)

857
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,390
Uh-oh. Your mama's gone.

858
01:30:25,229 --> 01:30:28,390
Oh, shit. Where did that crazy heifer go?

859
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,979
You guys see where she went?
Don't let her get away, you hear?

860
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,330
Wait a minute! Let us help you!

861
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,839
Please! Open the door!

862
01:30:45,839 --> 01:30:48,089
We wanna help you!

863
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,080
System remote override.
All doors locked.

864
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:03,729
(woman) You know I wouldn't
let you get away that easy.

865
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:31,000
I see you.

866
01:31:34,419 --> 01:31:36,589
And I see you, dearie.

867
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:40,700
(screams)

868
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,569
You get back in there! Get back in there!

869
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,680
Don't you touch me!

870
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,799
Don't you touch me! No!

871
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,669
You hurt your mother.

872
01:33:28,109 --> 01:33:30,299
You're not my mother.

873
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:33,910
You never were.

874
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,899
Then burn in hell!

875
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,490
Mommy!

876
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,299
(coins jingle)

877
01:34:52,779 --> 01:34:54,859
(jingling)

878
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:20,669
I know what you're doin'.
You're countin' that money.

879
01:35:21,229 --> 01:35:27,790
You're lettin' it roll through your fingers.
I've done it myself... a thousand times.

880
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:31,319
And I'll do it again.

881
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:34,060
But you won't!

882
01:35:52,259 --> 01:35:53,049
Hey!

883
01:35:56,399 --> 01:35:58,649
You shoot me and you die too, man.

884
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,580
And you better believe it.

885
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:06,330
Don't be crazy, now. There's enough
dynamite there to blow you sky-high.

886
01:36:07,569 --> 01:36:10,029
Not the best place
to store it, in my opinion.

887
01:36:10,609 --> 01:36:13,009
But there it was. Just put the gun down.

888
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:17,120
Put the gun down.

889
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,870
I don't wanna kill you, but I will,
cos I don't like you much anyway.

890
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:32,299
I'm tired of fuckin' around,
so either put the gun down now,...

891
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:36,270
..or kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

892
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:45,120
Oh, shit!

893
01:37:15,589 --> 01:37:17,109
All right!

894
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:19,649
(yelling and cheering)

895
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:24,290
Fool?

896
01:37:28,899 --> 01:37:30,919
Fool, are you OK?

897
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,660
I feel like a million dollars.

898
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:42,080
