1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:02,413
I gotta get out of here
and you should too.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,912
<i>Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...</i>

3
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,874
The minute you see Michonne,
you open fire.

4
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:11,171
Kill the others
but you keep her alive.

5
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,665
I ain't gonna beg!

6
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,928
We can stay and we can fight,

7
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,572
or we can go.

8
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:20,577
You knew she was
leaving, didn't you?

9
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:21,920
She told me.

10
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:28,670
Shh, shh.

11
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,974
I have to say I was impressed.

12
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,194
You had taken a risk.

13
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,776
Getting your hands dirty.

14
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:10,505
You know, we were
gonna have those biters

15
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:13,541
for our little
Michonne and--

16
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:18,624
You were gonna use
them <i>on whoever showed up.</i>

17
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,325
That's right.

18
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:22,216
Hey, hey.

19
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:25,803
Because we didn't have them,

20
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:29,023
you shouldn't burned them up,

21
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,392
eight of my men died.

22
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,536
Now, you knew
those men. Huh?

23
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:45,123
They kept you safe,
kept you fed.

24
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:49,994
As long as I looked
the other way.

25
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:52,064
Yeah.

26
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:55,067
Well, it can't be
like that anymore.

27
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:59,870
Time for you to graduate.

28
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:06,528
Hey.

29
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,351
I'm gonna tell you the secret.

30
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,048
There's a threat, you end it.

31
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,992
And you don't feel ashamed
about enjoying it.

32
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,336
You smell the gunpowder
and you see the blood--

33
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,199
you know what that means?

34
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,312
It means you're alive.

35
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:38,376
You've won.

36
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:41,824
You take the heads so that
you don't ever forget.

37
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:45,933
You kill or you die.

38
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:55,200
What would your daughter think

39
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,868
about what you are?

40
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:03,225
She'd be afraid of me.

41
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,069
But if I had been
like this from the start,

42
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,205
she'd be alive today.

43
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,968
Did you kill Andrea?

44
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,112
Milton.

45
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:29,081
See? She's still alive.

46
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,596
I'm gonna need her
for something.

47
00:03:31,597 --> 00:03:33,481
I heard you in the other room.

48
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:36,484
You don't have to lose
any more of your men.

49
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:37,985
Just stop this.

50
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:42,176
Your friends
at the prison--

51
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:43,908
I'm gonna kill them all.

52
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,525
<i>People are gonna help me.</i>

53
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:51,082
I had to stretch the truth a
little bit, but just a little.

54
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,952
Now they're foaming
at the mouth.

55
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:59,040
You, get those tools.

56
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,991
I'm not gonna
need them anymore.

57
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,493
Go on.

58
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,604
Careful.
Pick that up.

59
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,848
<i>Come on! Step to.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

60
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,540
Hold up.

61
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,460
I'll take that.

62
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,962
Put 'em down.

63
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:50,174
You're gonna kill her now.

64
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:55,396
You're gonna show me that
you've learned something.

65
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:00,704
Milton...

66
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:04,188
there is no way
you are leaving this room

67
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:05,888
without doing it.

68
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,275
So don't make it hard.

69
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,008
Just--

70
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,192
just do it.

71
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:17,888
That's it.

72
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:48,096
I told you
you were gonna do it.

73
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,537
And now you're gonna die.

74
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:58,016
And you're gonna turn.

75
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:01,245
And you're gonna tear
the flesh from her bones.

76
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,584
<i>In this life now,</i>

77
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,924
you kill or you die.

78
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:20,416
Or you die and you kill.

Carl.

81
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,941
I've never seen him this mad.

82
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:41,161
Even with Lori.
He just shut down.

83
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,949
He's still a kid.

84
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,284
It's easy to forget.

85
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:12,943
You know, Merle never did nothing
like that his whole life.

86
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,478
He gave us a chance.

87
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,383
We're ready.

88
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:44,391
The deal the Governor
offered about me--

89
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,943
you had to think about it.

90
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:49,863
You had to.
I get it.

91
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,350
Yeah.

92
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:57,454
I'm sorry.
I came real close.

93
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,322
But you didn't.

94
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:08,298
I never thanked you.

95
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,833
For what?

96
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:14,704
For getting me
out there that day,

97
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:16,389
taking me in.

98
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,562
Well, if you didn't have
that baby formula,

99
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,648
I wouldn't have.

100
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,234
You could have
just taken the formula.

101
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,769
Well...

102
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,022
must have been
something else, then.

103
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:38,862
You know, it was Carl
who made the call.

104
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:41,581
He said you belonged here.

105
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,917
You're one of us.

106
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:56,412
Remember, they killed
eight men back there.

107
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,298
Five here last time.

108
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,884
They're no different
from the biters.

109
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:03,553
They're not gonna stop
until they kill us all,

110
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:06,556
taken everything
we've worked so hard for.

111
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:09,025
We're gonna end this
once and for all.

112
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:10,527
Governor.

113
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,813
This ain't easy to say.

114
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,234
You're gonna have
to count us out.

115
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,569
This isn't our fight.

116
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,454
<i>We'll fight against the biters,</i>

117
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:23,623
not other people.

118
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:26,126
Now we'll stay here
and defend the children.

119
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:29,445
When you return,
if you want us gone,

120
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,581
no hard feelings.

121
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:54,354
Thank you.

122
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:06,866
Let's roll!

123
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,324
Go!

124
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:39,175
Go, go! Move!

125
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:41,294
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

126
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,933
_

127
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,440
Give me a flashlight.

128
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,577
Let's split up.
You take a group that way.

129
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:13,396
You, bring a group, follow me.

130
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,178
Go.

131
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:39,305
<i>- Milton?</i>
<i>- When the tools dropped,</i>

132
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:42,725
I-I left some pliers

133
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,778
on the floor behind you.

134
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:50,567
If you can drag--

135
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:54,487
if you can drag your right foot back,
you-- you can get them.

136
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:10,453
That-- that's it.

137
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:12,972
- Oh, God.
- Almost.

138
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:16,509
I'm gonna get us both
out of here.

139
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,845
And you're gonna be okay.

140
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:21,514
<i>Now when--</i>
<i>when you get free,</i>

141
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:25,068
you are going to find
something very sharp...

142
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:29,989
and you are going
to stab me in the head.

143
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,945
That is what
you are going to do.

144
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,816
Keep trying.

145
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:45,888
Come on.

146
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:07,645
Hey, look over there.

147
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,317
<i>What was that?</i>

148
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:21,123
<i>Shh.</i>

149
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,016
This way.

150
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,151
We took out a few biters
on the south wall.

151
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:52,571
Other than that,
everything's quiet.

152
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,323
I'll get the next one.

153
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:59,027
What do you think happens
when they return?

154
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:02,197
We might have to slip out.
Andrea made it out.

155
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:05,701
If she's at the prison,
it didn't do her any good.

156
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:07,670
I'll be right back.

157
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,538
- It's my turn.
- Stay put.

158
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,707
I got it.

159
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:20,399
I got it.
I got it.

160
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,854
Milton?

161
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:54,967
Milton.

162
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:57,436
Why did you stay...

163
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:03,442
after you found out
your friends were out there?

164
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:08,263
I wanted to save everyone.

165
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:13,702
Even the Governor for a while.

166
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,273
I had a chance to kill him.

167
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:20,275
What stopped you?

168
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:22,778
You know, this was before.

169
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:26,381
He was asleep.
I had a knife.

170
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,502
But I tried to stop it all
another way...

171
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:37,142
because I didn't want
anyone to die.

172
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,192
I'm still here.

173
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:57,329
<i>I'm still alive.</i>

174
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:01,316
Yeah.

175
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,702
You are.

176
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,874
You need to hurry.

177
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,848
Right.

178
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,967
Okay.

179
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,289
On the ground!

180
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,575
On the ground!

181
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:49,047
Go!

182
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,060
Get the hell out of here!

183
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,321
I should be there.

184
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:21,580
- Go!
- Go. Go, go, go.

185
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:26,869
Go!

186
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,670
Move!

187
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:37,346
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

188
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:38,847
- It's not working.
- Go, man!

189
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,632
Shit.
It's jammed!

190
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:48,390
- Hey!
- They're not helping anyway. Come on.

191
00:23:01,704 --> 00:23:03,622
We did it?

192
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,273
We did it.

193
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:06,608
Come on down.

194
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:21,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't shoot.

195
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:22,791
Drop the weapon, son.

196
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,794
Sure.

197
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,263
Here, take it.

198
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:52,761
<i>We did it.</i>
<i>We drove them out.</i>

199
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,296
We should go after them.

200
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,298
- We should finish it.
<i>- It is finished.</i>

201
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,799
<i>Didn't you see them</i>
<i>hightail it out of here?</i>

202
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,568
- They could regroup.
- We can't take the chance.

203
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:01,153
- He's not gonna stop.
- They're right.

204
00:24:01,154 --> 00:24:02,404
We can't keep living like this.

205
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:03,638
So we take the fight
back to Woodbury.

206
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,190
We barely made it back
last time.

207
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,742
I don't care.

208
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,660
Yeah.

209
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:13,165
- Let's check on the others.
- Come on.

210
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,715
Hey.

211
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:38,891
- Hey.
- Dad, I'm coming to Woodbury.

212
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:41,560
- Carl.
- Dad, I did my job out there.

213
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:43,445
Just like all of you.

214
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:45,113
Took out one
of the Governor's soldiers.

215
00:24:45,114 --> 00:24:47,900
<i>One of his soldiers?</i>

216
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,619
A kid running away?
He stumbled across us.

217
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,287
No, he drew on us.

218
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,324
I'm sorry you had to do that.

219
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,576
It's what I was there for.

220
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:59,578
I'm going with you.

221
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,753
That kid was scared.

222
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:10,005
He was handing his gun over.

223
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:13,375
He said he drew.

224
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:18,513
Carl said it was in defense.

225
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:20,933
I was there.
He didn't have to shoot.

226
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:22,484
He had every reason
not to--

227
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:25,354
- Maybe it looked like that
to you, Hershel-- - Rick!

228
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:31,493
I'm telling you

229
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:34,079
he gunned that kid down.

230
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:45,624
Pull over!

231
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:49,294
Hey! I want
this truck over.

232
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:50,629
Go, go!

233
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,521
What the hell are you doing?

234
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:01,606
- We need to dig in.
- It's not worth it.

235
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,642
- That was a slaughter.
- You bunch of pussies.

236
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:05,560
I told you we should have
handled this shit ourselves.

237
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:08,196
We're done fighting for a hole with a
half dozen psychopaths living in it.

238
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:11,066
- They can keep it. <i>- You've seen</i>
<i>what they've done-- attacked us.</i>

239
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,485
- They killed my boy. We're going back.
<i>- We are not soldiers.</i>

240
00:26:13,486 --> 00:26:16,071
You want us to kill
biters, of course.

241
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:17,706
- <i>But this is crazy.</i>
<i>- Then go home, then.</i>

242
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:19,107
<i>You think you're gonna be safe?</i>

243
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:20,325
<i>I'm going back to Woodbury.</i>

244
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:22,444
We're not here
to settle a grudge.

245
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,455
Come on.

246
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:31,957
Okay.

247
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:34,543
Okay.

248
00:28:34,544 --> 00:28:36,511
Okay.

249
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,046
Okay.

250
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:46,054
You're still here.

251
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:48,773
You're still alive.

252
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,392
All right.

253
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,487
Shit!

254
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,458
All right.

255
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:31,016
All right. Okay.

256
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:05,240
Michonne.

257
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:21,723
Hershel told me
about the boy you shot.

258
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:24,626
He had a gun.

259
00:30:24,627 --> 00:30:26,628
Hmm.

260
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,849
Was he handing it over?

261
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,488
- He had just attacked us.
- Yeah.

262
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:38,607
Yes, he had.

263
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,946
Was he handing it over?

264
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,586
I couldn't take the chance.

265
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,454
I didn't kill the walker
that killed Dale.

266
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:54,590
- Look what happened.
- Son, that is not the same thing.

267
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:57,042
You didn't kill Andrew

268
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,494
and he came back
and killed Mom.

269
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,932
You were in a room
with the Governor

270
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,334
and you let him go.

271
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:08,937
And then he killed Merle.

272
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:11,390
I did what I had to do.

273
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,528
Now go.

274
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:20,149
So he doesn't kill
any more of us.

275
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:42,304
Rick, we're staying.

276
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,056
We don't know
where the Governor is.

277
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:46,008
If he comes back,
we'll hold him off.

278
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,044
Just the three of us?

279
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:50,679
All right.

280
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:53,682
I appreciate you staying.

281
00:31:53,683 --> 00:31:55,217
Sure.

282
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,326
Come on.
Come on.

283
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,226
Okay, okay.

284
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:06,231
No! Come on!

285
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:17,909
<i>Let me go!</i>

286
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,548
<i>Tyreese!</i>

287
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:51,101
- It's me! Don't--
- Get down!

288
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:52,553
<i>Karen!</i>

289
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:54,188
Karen, are you okay?

290
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:57,391
- I'm fine!
- <i>Where's the Governor?</i>

291
00:34:57,392 --> 00:34:59,393
He fired on everyone.

292
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:01,278
He killed them all.

293
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:11,872
- Why are you with them?
- They saved me.

294
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,544
We're coming out!

295
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,333
We're coming out.

296
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,906
What are you doing here?

297
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,659
We were coming to finish this

298
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,412
until we saw
what the Governor did.

299
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:55,749
He-- he killed them?

300
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,952
Yeah.

301
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:02,539
Karen told us
Andrea hopped the wall

302
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,041
going for the prison.

303
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:05,909
She never made it.

304
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:09,930
She might be here.

305
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:11,882
This is where he
had Glenn and Maggie.

306
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,383
The Governor held people here?

307
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:15,218
He did more than hold them.

308
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,291
Will you open it?

309
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:43,497
One, two...

310
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:49,219
Andrea!

311
00:36:56,811 --> 00:36:58,895
I tried to stop them.

312
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,964
You're burning up.

313
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:14,611
Judith, Carl,

314
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,496
the rest of them...

315
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:19,199
Us.

316
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,835
The rest of us.

317
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,656
Are they alive?

318
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,832
Yeah, they're alive.

319
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:46,226
It's good you found them.

320
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:53,900
No one can make it alone now.

321
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:56,987
I never could.

322
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:04,711
I just didn't want
anyone to die.

323
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:12,636
- I can do it myself.
- No.

324
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:15,305
I have to.

325
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:19,009
While I still can.

326
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,385
Please?

327
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,445
I know how the safety works.

328
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,799
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

329
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:22,789
I tried.

330
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,493
Yeah.

331
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:30,113
You did.

332
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:33,116
You did.

333
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,081
What is this?

334
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:35,885
They're gonna join us.
