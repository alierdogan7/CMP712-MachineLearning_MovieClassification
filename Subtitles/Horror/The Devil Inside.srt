What Maria Rossi did,
and her subsequent life,

75
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,784
was incredibly tragic and clouded.

76
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,493

how is it possible for Mrs. Rossi
to have done what she did,

81
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,517
I would have gone through the list
of things that cause human aggression.

82
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,012
Something like major depression,
or schizophrenia,

83

that her current psychiatric diagnosis
has been D.I.D.

86
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,653

"Mom attacked those people
during an exorcism."

102
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,750
An exorcism performed on her.

103
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,960
It's the job of science to try to sort out

104
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,508
what is a reasonable,
plausible explanation.

105
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,794
But science can't explain everything,

106
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,003
such as a person

107
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,806
levitating two feet off the ground
during an exorcism.

108
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,020
I asked my dad if he thought
she was possessed.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,267
He said he didn't know.

110
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,601
That she was gone. It didn't matter.

111
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,444
Not any more.

112
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,399
He died three days later.

<i>I called the church
where the priests had come from.</i>

114
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,664
<i>And they wouldn't talk about it.</i>

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,789
<i>They said they don't have
an ordained exorcist and never did.</i>

116

the Vatican School for Exorcism.

multiple demonic possession.

140

These cases are extremely
volatile and dangerous,

141
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,524
and they sometimes
lead to transference,

142
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,536

the demon jumps from one person

The girl fractured her own femur.

178

Her strength might have been abnormal,

179
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,022
It's very well known that

to rule out mental illness.

182

could not be proved as possession.

drew you to this school?

191

In particular, to exorcism?

of science and religion.

193
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,609
I think,
based on my background in medicine,

194
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,736
it gave me a greater sense of purpose.

195

We all talk so definitively
about God and about the Devil

196

but we can all agree that there's
no real facts, right? No proofs?

197
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,754
God has never helped me.
What about you?

Sure. Yeah.

an exorcism in class?

This is a school of exorcism, is it not?

202
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,725
It's not reality.

It's a mental disorder.

No. When you witness
someone possessed,

218
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:20,322

these murders during an exorcism.

You know,
my father received a letter from Rome.

242
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,731
I guess because priests were involved.
The Holy Church got involved <i>as</i> well.

243

And they said that they wanted to
treat my mother at Centrino.

244

They called it

245
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,438
an "offering of forgiveness."

246
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,151

God was forgiving my mother.

00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,060
<i>And it forces you to be resilient.</i>

351
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,602
<i>Possession and exorcism
have dictated my life.</i>

352
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,234
<i>It took my mom
and it basically killed my dad.</i>

353
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,316
<i>It defines me now.</i>

354
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,197
<i>I mean, here I am</i>

355
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,827
<i>I flew halfway across...
You know, halfway across the world</i>

356
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,499
<i>to see this woman
who I never thought I'd see again.</i>

357
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,085
<i>I don't like that it defines me.</i>

358
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,753
ISABELLA: <i>I contacted
Father Ben Rawlings and David Keane</i>

359
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,132
<i>in hopes that they would review
the footage of my mother.</i>

360
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,801
Luckily, they agreed
and invited me to their loft.

361
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,737
Isabella, hi, welcome.

362
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,073
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

363
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:13,406
It's hard to say
why I wanted to be a priest.

364
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,742
<i>Maybe I was drawn to helping people.</i>

365
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,710
<i>I think that duality exists within all of
us and, occasionally, it can take form.</i>

366
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:26,837
<i>Science can no longer help,
and religion has to take over.</i>

367
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,964
Which can be really difficult
for people to accept.

368
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,225
Isabella, nice to see you again.
How are you? You okay? Okay, great.

369
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,061
- Can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
- Sure.

370
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,480
I'm sorry, I forgot your...

371
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,183
- Michael.
- Michael.

372
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,771
My family were always very religious.

373
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,821
My mother and father,
they were teachers,

374
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:50,367
but I was closest to my uncle.
He was a priest.

375
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,740
<i>By the time I was 13,
he told me that he was an exorcist.</i>

376
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,662
<i>And, well,</i>

377
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,999
if you can imagine...

378
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,670
It's like, I suppose, you know,
you being told that

379
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,176
your dad is Superman.

380
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,676
That's what it felt like to me.
That he was in direct,

381
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,597
you know, war, I suppose,
with the Devil.

382
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,723
And, I don't know,
it blew me away, really.

383
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,229
<i>And so, he took me along with him
and by the time I was 18,</i>

384
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,360
I'd seen four exorcisms.
I'd even assisted on one.

385
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,821
And it just changes you.

386
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,992
<i>Unfortunately, he passed away
a couple years ago.</i>

387
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,993
Anyway, when I was 23,
I went into the priesthood.

388
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,754
And by the time I was 27,
I was an ordained exorcist.

389
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,672
<i>But I'll tell you this.</i>

390
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,926
After all the years
that I've been in the Church

391
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,846
I've seen the Devil
way more than I've seen God.

392
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,473
That's just not the way
it's supposed to be.

393
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,516
There, what did she say to you there?

394
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,979
Oh, uh...

395
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,777
Yeah, at the end there,
she started remembering things,

396
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,697
specific things,
and she said something to me.

397
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,941
But I'm not sure if she said...

398
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,694
What? What was it?

399
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,870
I terminated a pregnancy
about four years ago.

400
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,459
The doctor said
I couldn't carry it to term, so...

401
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,705
Anyway, she knew about it,
and she said that...

402
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,044
Something about
being against God's will or something.

403
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,299
Hang on. Let's just look at that.

404
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,556
It's against God's will, you know.

405
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,845
ISABELLA:
That means something, right?

406
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,144
DAVID: Possibly. You said you had
a copy of her medical charts?

407
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,345
Wait, wait, wait.

408
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,892
What are those?

409
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,062
ISABELLA: Oh! She cuts herself.

410
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,485
DAVID: Those are crosses, Ben.

411
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,405
Crosses? Wait, wouldn't she
not want crosses if she's possessed?

412
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,233
- Not necessarily.
- Look at them. Look at them.

413
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,819
The way that she's seeing them,
they're upside down.

414
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:01,078
They're inverted crosses.
They're typically used in Satanic rituals.

415
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,075
I don't have a daughter.

416
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,410
DAVID: Wait, is she speaking
with an accent?

417
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,245
ISABELLA: Yeah,
she did that some. Why?

418
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,330
DAVID: Different accents can be like
speaking in tongues.

419
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,546
The pregnancy,
did you tell her about that at all?

420
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,672
ISABELLA: No.

421
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,752
DAVID: And you're absolutely sure

422
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,008
there's no other way
she could have found out?

423
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,182
I mean, there's no way.

424
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,057
See, there are basically four factors

425
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,935
when it comes to
determining demonic possession.

426
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,187
One, unnatural strength.

427
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,191
You got aversion to holy objects.

428
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,239
Languages or events
that they could not have known.

429
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,191
And preternatural movement,

430
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,992
which is basically
objects moving around the room.

431
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,206
So, strength? No. Languages, no.

432
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,959
Preternatural movement, no.
Aversion to holy objects, maybe.

433
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,711
Yeah, but there are accents
and, Ben, she knew that information.

434
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,633
Yeah, that interests me.

435
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,716
We need to show you something.

436
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay. Can I bring the camera?

437
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,350
- Sure.
- All right.

438
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,560
Okay.

439
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,071
- Can I bring this?
- Yeah, of course. Come on through.

440
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,985
MICHAEL: I'm good. I'm right behind you.
Keep going.

441
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,243
ISABELLA: What is all this?
Who are these people?

442
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,500
BEN: These are people
the Church turned down for exorcism.

443
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,252
- And they're all possessed?
BEN: - We believe they are.

444
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,258
These two cases are resolved.
Those two are open

445
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,756
and we're almost done with this one.

446
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,681
This is the girl, Rosa, right?
From the video we saw in Gallo's class?

447
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,387
You both thought she was possessed.

448
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,440
BEN: She is.
We think the Church made a mistake.

449
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,478
So correct me if I'm wrong,

450
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,783
but you guys are performing
these exorcisms yourselves,

451
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,202
without the Church's permission?

452
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,783
That's right. We have to. Otherwise,
these people would continue to suffer.

453
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,585
What is all that?

454
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,167
DAVID: We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

455
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,418
Yeah, go ahead.

456
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,342
That's a camera we use
to determine pupil dilation,

457
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,091
which is very important
in cases of possession.

458
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,432
Nine millimeters
is as large as the average pupil gets.

459
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,596
Maybe 10 or 11
under certain substances

460
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,019
like cocaine, psilocybin,
methamphetamines.

461
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,684
Anything above 11
is considered preternatural.

462
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,683
Why doesn't the Church
help these people?

463
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,063
You see, that's just it.

464
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,941
The Church isn't in the business
of healing people.

465
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,530
The bureaucracy won't allow it.

466
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,901
Their hands are tied. In 1999,
the Church changed the exorcism rites

467
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,361
for the first time in almost 400 years.

468
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,321
Now a priest has to be
absolutely certain

469
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,625
that there's an evil presence
in order to even attempt an exorcism.

470
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,373
And that's a near impossible task,
because a lot of the time

471
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,964
it takes an exorcism
for a demon to reveal itself.

472
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,838
But rather than get distracted
by the Church's hypocrisy,

473
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,882
we're going to
continue to care for these people.

474
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,970
So that means that my mother's case
can actually be something...

475
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,343
DAVID: No, no. Isabella, you...

476
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,012
The Church will never pursue
your mother's case

477
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,844
because the last time someone did,
people died.

478
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,854
What do you suggest?

479
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,689
If you really want to help your mother,

480
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,017
you need a better understanding
of exorcism.

481
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,190
A real understanding.

482
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,358
Okay. So take more classes
and maybe show Gallo the tape?

483
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,618
Isabella, you'll learn more
in five minutes of an exorcism

484
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,620
than you will
in three months in some class.

485
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,204
Plus, you'll get to know
the real difference

486
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,912
between possession and mental illness.

487
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,135
So witness a real exorcism?

488
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,214
With you?

489
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,140
If you want.

490
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,560
So the exorcism rites,
when they were updated,

491
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,103
what exactly changed?

492
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,740
Well, for one, all media coverage
of exorcisms were banned.

493
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,155
Not that they were filmed much anyway.

494
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,154
Exorcisms can take minutes
or they can take years.

495
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,580
No two are the same.

496
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,418
Is this thing we're doing even legal?

497
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,167
No. Not exactly.

498
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,969
You never know what's going to happen.

there's a panic button on the wall.

00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,225
Pulse is dropping.

856
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,016
Maria? Maria, can you hear us?

857
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,059
DAVID: Starting to regain
consciousness.

858
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,987
Temp is returning to normal.

859
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,485
Over.

860
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,458
BEN: <i>Tell me your name, coward!</i>
MARIA: <i>Asbeel!</i>

861
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,045
I'll be feeling that tomorrow.

862
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,125
See, this is preternatural movement
right here.

863
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,880
I've seen it before,
but I've never captured it on tape.

864
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,670
So, what does that mean?

865
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:19,678
It means we've got
everything that we need right here.

866
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,850
This is huge, Isabella.

867
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,511
Let's play it again.

868
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,393
BEN: Do you realize how big this is?

869
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,648
With the evidence we've got,

870
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,692
the Holy See has to see us.
They have to.

871
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,520
We can go to the press with this

872
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,573
and in an instant, we'd have
1,000 people standing out there.

873
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:39,030
DAVID: Our priority right now
should be getting her back to the States.

874
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,528
The endorsement of Dr. Costa is vital.

875
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:45,082
But after the results that he saw,
there's no way that he can't agree.

876
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,834
Dr. Costa doesn't believe
that she was possessed or anything.

877
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,084
He thinks it was an exercise
that shocked her system.

878
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,506
Anyway, it doesn't matter
what he believes

879
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,381
because his referral's actually gonna
help us get her back to the States.

882
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,266
I'm just...

883
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,187
I'm just analyzing Maria's audio.

884
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:15,897
I'm just trying to work out if there is
more than one voice inside her.

885
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,240
See, there can...

See? See? Right there. You hear that?

888
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,418
- She's speaking in tongues, right?
- No, no.

889
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:35,417
It's one sentence, spoken in
more than one language, I think.

890
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,626
I'm just trying to isolate how many.

MARIA: <i>You wanted him to die,
didn't you?</i>

893
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,979
Ben, what is she talking about?

894
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,440

895
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,651
Is she talking about your uncle?

00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,861
I found four voices on the recording.
I found four voices on the recording.

897
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,072
DAVID: You found four?
ISABELLA: Wait, what does that mean?

898
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,784
It means that the entity
in your mother had disciples.

899
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,710
We call it multiple demonic possession.

900
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,880
You might have heard
Gallo talking about it in class.

901
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,299
ISABELLA: Wait,
so it's a powerful demon.

902
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,626
BEN: Yeah. It's a beast.

903

- What?
- You know how lucky we are?

905

Look, we're gonna deliver all our
findings to the Holy See next Friday.

906
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,721
Yeah, maybe.
He hasn't agreed to see us.

907
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,023
Yeah, well, have you told him that
the press might be interested?

908
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,566
DAVID: That's not very diplomatic.

909
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,689
Can't we just wait a little bit
till my mother's case is resolved?

910
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,894
I mean, the press?

911
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,606
Hang on a minute. Just because
you've got what you want now,

912
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,613
you're expecting us just to keep quiet?
Michael, please, just get...

913
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,410
Stop! Stop! That's not what I meant!

914
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,738
Because there are lot more
people to help

915
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,289
rather than just your mother, okay?

916
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,914
DAVID: Wait, did Father Gallo call you?
ISABELLA: What's your problem?

917
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,336
No. You?

918
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,163
Yeah, he called me twice.

919
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,504
What did he say?

920
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,962
He wants to help us
make the right decision.

921
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,468
He's worried about us.
Especially, he's worried about me.

922
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,891
- You? Why?
- Because of my job, Ben.

923
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,682
David, what are you doing
with the papers? Are you okay?

924
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,640
I'm fine. The conversation's just
giving me a little bit of a headache.

925
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:17,021
David, he's just trying to scare you.
That's all.

926
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,101
ISABELLA: - Is that blood?
- He's a moral man.

927
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,028
And he's toeing the company line
on this one and you know it.

928
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,776
ISABELLA: Is your nose bleeding?

929
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,738
David, you got something.
Are you okay?

00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,407
BEN: - Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.

00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,750
I'm sorry.

933
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,124
It's probably stress.

934
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,882
- It's a lot of work to do for Friday.
- Yeah.

935
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,008
MICHAEL: Are you all right?

936
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,525
- They won't release her.
- MICHAEL: What?

937
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,895
- Why not?
- I don't know. They won't say.

938
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,988
They can't or won't believe
that she's better.

939
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,492
- Where are my keys?
- I don't...

940
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,375
Where are my fucking keys?
They were right here.

941
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,623
- I don't know. Relax.
- Where are my fucking keys, Michael?

942
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,794
I don't know.
It feels like they'll never release her.

943
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,179
There's no way
the Church can't see this.

944
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:30,804
I can look them in the eye and tell them
that it was the right thing to do.

no matter who it hurts or destroys.

Well, not this time.
Not this fucking time.

949
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,707
This was supposed to be
about my mother. Not anybody else.

950
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,036
Not about Ben's ego, or David's job.

951
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,966
I have a sinking feeling I'm going to be
excommunicated for all this. I think.

- For what we did.
- David's inner coward

is really coming out.

but Isabella,

00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,303
we started this together.

and I'm like
the annoying guy with the camera.

David, what the fuck are you doing?

962

If it weren't for me

963
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,295
no one would know anything
about what the hell they're doing

we need to talk about some stuff.

- What's wrong with the camera?
- I don't know. Just...

01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,612
What's wrong?

969
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,993
- Not then. Before she hit you.
- Michael, did you see anything?

970
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,199
No, I didn't see anything.

971

BEN: Okay, we'll just try another...
ISABELLA: This is something else.

Yeah, but it's at the exact same time.

through the hospital.

- The bishop denied our request.

- I'm fine. You ready?

<i>if a baby were to die
after being baptized</i>

01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,440
it would go to Heaven.

And if before

999
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,948
