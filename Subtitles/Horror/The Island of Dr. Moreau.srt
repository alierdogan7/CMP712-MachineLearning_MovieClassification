1
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:13,940
Our plane crashed in the endless
southern Pacific.

2
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,944
We drifted for days
between life and death.

3
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,446
On the sixth or seventh day.

4
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,450
The two men
who'd survived with me...

5
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,112
began to fight over
the last canteen of water.

6
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,406
They fought like beasts.
Not men.

7
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,336
Stop!

8
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:51,200
I fought for my life
just as savagely as they did.

9
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,360
Positively no other survivors.

10
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:04,066
Feeling better?

11
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,742
Where am I?

12
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:15,407
You're on a seafaring vessel
named the Ombak Penari.

13
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,989
Who are you?

14
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:24,217
My name's Montgomery.

15
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:26,418
And you are?

16
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,421
Edward Douglas.

17
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,364
I was on my way to Djakarta.

18
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:38,200
My plane went down.

19
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:45,212
I'm working on an assignment
for the United Nations.

20
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:49,078
The peace settlement.

21
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,914
There was lots of blood
on that raft.

22
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,221
You were the only survivor.

23
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,959
I need to get to a radio
as soon as possible.

24
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,129
Be calm. Just be calm.

25
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,298
I'm still hydrating you.

26
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,205
There's no radio
on this vessel.

27
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,813
I'm going to pay the captain
of this ship...

28
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,814
to take you to Timor.

29
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,182
Which is about four days
after they drop me off...

30
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,186
at my little island paradise.

31
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:30,154
What are you giving me?

32
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,159
Oh. You'll like it. I like it.

33
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,264
It's a little Jimi Hendrix.

34
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,263
No. Wait! Wait. Wait. Wait.

35
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,867
Are you a doctor?

36
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,027
I'm more like a vet.

37
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,799
Excuse me a minute.

38
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,047
All right. Don't be rude.

39
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,714
There you are.

40
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:39,951
Where are we?

41
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:43,223
It's Moreau's island.
There's been a change of plans.

42
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,492
You must come with us.

43
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:53,007
Well. Maybe I should stay.

44
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,201
We've got a radio.
We'll get you away in two days.

45
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,404
The choice is yours.

46
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:02,677
You can stay on the boat. But
these guys are party animals.

47
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,117
Captain Penari here
has taken quite a shine to you.

48
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,348
If you know what I mean.

49
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,516
It's really best
that you come with me.

50
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,933
Can I help you with the rest?

51
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,936
That's okay.
The others'll take it.

52
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,596
The others?

53
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,941
The islanders?

54
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,603
Yes. The islanders.

55
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,212
How did this get here?

56
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,877
The Dutch
were the first whites...

57
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,887
to settle the island in 1890.

58
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,958
Made a coffee plantation.

59
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:47,289
The Americans
took over in World War II.

60
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,990
The Japanese bought it and tried
a hotel resort.

61
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,135
Which went belly up.

62
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:29,729
I used to have a rabbit
as a little boy.

63
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,169
Called Kesey.

64
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,736
Died. My own neglect.
I'm sorry to say.

65
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:43,214
I've never been very good
with animals.

66
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:46,219
He's a beauty.

67
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,481
He. She.

68
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:50,887
What's going on in your head?

69
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,624
Good Lord!

70
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,736
Hold that.

71
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,396
Oh. Please.

72
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:11,737
We don't actually eat meat.

73
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,974
But I'm sure the doctor'll make
an exception for you.

74
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,142
Our special. Unexpected guest.

75
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,481
It will be
our little secret. Okay?

76
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,181
Come on.

77
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,786
That's a very impressive
communications center.

78
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:05,298
Except only I can fix it.
And it was down before we left.

79
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,698
I'll get it running soon.
Don't worry.

80
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,830
I'll have to ask you...

81
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,333
to restrict your movements
to the main house.

82
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,836
The people
who fund this project...

83
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:47,840
are afraid you'll
sprain an ankle and sue us.

84
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,774
Well. It's a litigious world.

85
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,345
Yes.

86
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:56,508
Stay right here.
I won't be long.

87
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,326
I'm sorry.

88
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,359
It's okay.

89
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,463
Who are you?

90
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:53,124
I just got here.

91
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,972
I came on the boat
this morning with Montgomery.

92
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:02,633
You come from the sea?

93
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:06,979
Well. Originally
I'm from England.

94
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,983
England? That's another island.

95
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,145
I've read about it
in many books.

96
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,654
My name's Edward Douglas.

97
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,654
You have such beautiful hands.

98
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,897
- So beautiful.
- Oh. Thank you.

99
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:35,007
Are you.
Are you from this island?

100
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,509
My father brought me here.

101
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,671
Doctor Moreau?

102
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,643
Where are you from originally?

103
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,030
Getting acquainted?

104
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,637
She is beautiful.

105
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,535
She's a pussycat.

106
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:11,038
I've arranged quarters
for you upstairs.

107
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,703
Wonderful.

108
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,550
I saw the Nobel Prize.

109
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,553
I think I remember Moreau.

110
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:23,715
Didn't he vanish or something?

111
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,552
I thought he was dead.

112
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,460
No. He's still working.

113
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:35,226
What exactly
did he win his prize for?

114
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,065
He invented Velcro.

115
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,203
I see.

116
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,310
And how long has he been here?

117
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,969
Seventeen years.

118
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:52,986
He became... obsessed
with his... animal research.

119
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,426
Animal rights activists
drove him out of the States.

120
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:08,298
You couldn't cage a rat
without reading him his rights.

121
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,474
How long have you been here?

122
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:22,615
I wrote a paper
that was published.

123
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,117
And we started a correspondence.

124
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:29,348
So about 10 years ago
I came out...

125
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,789
and helped him with his work.

126
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,056
Eventually...

127
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,040
Let me show you
to your room.

128
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,751
Very agreeable.

129
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:15,167
Look. I don't want to
be an imposition here.

130
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:18,898
As soon as you can get
this Com Sat equipment working.

131
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,735
I can...

132
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,070
They'll send a plane for me.

133
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,364
Why've you locked the door?

134
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,592
For your own good.

135
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,868
Lovely!

136
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:21,807
My God.

137
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,169
I'll help you leave this island.

138
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,670
If you promise...

139
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,071
not to do or say anything
that'll hurt my father.

140
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:49,972
We must go.

141
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:54,638
There's a lot of unstable
phenomena out there.

142
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:02,971
It's all right.

143
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,406
You from boat?

144
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:07,207
He's a five-finger man.

145
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:10,909
He's a five-finger man.
Like you. See?

146
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,820
Look. look.

147
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,788
- Good.
- Five-finger man...

148
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,491
Good.

149
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,437
My name Assassimon.

150
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,908
Assassimon.

151
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:47,949
Assassimon! You must help us
find Sayer of the Law.

152
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,091
Quick.

153
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:53,125
Come! Come!
Come. Hurry!

154
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,037
It is a hard way...
the way of being a man.

155
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:17,367
Sooner or later.
We all want a thing that is bad:

156
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:23,108
To walk on all fours.

157
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:28,415
To suck up drink from a stream.

158
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:35,758
To jabber instead of
saying the words.

159
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:42,028
To go snuffling at the earth
and claw on the bark of trees.

160
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:47,438
To eat flesh or fish.

161
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:52,637
To make love to more than one.
Every which way.

162
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,674
These are all bad things.

163
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:01,686
These are not the things
that men do.

164
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:05,792
But we are men. Are we not?

165
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:11,526
We are men because
the Father has made us men!

166
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:14,634
Sayer of the Law.

167
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:18,671
Another Five Man has come
to hear law and wisdom.

168
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:36,552
The Father sent for you?

169
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:39,158
You are here to help Him
in His work?

170
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:43,821
The other Five Man is
looking for us. Please help us.

171
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,201
The Father! The Father!

172
00:29:58,413 --> 00:29:59,903
Bring the Five Man.

173
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,782
Release him.

174
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,776
Release him.

175
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,988
Give him the gun.

176
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,628
What?

177
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,320
Give him the gun.

178
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:30,437
He's very frightened.
Give it to him.

179
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:43,475
- No!
- Move!

180
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,879
No.

181
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:46,816
He won't hurt her.

182
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:54,791
I beg you.
Please do not confuse them.

183
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,158
Move back.

184
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,535
Move back!

185
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:17,349
Stop!

186
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:23,448
For God's sake. Stop!

187
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,624
Calm yourself. Mr. Douglas.

188
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:33,961
Don't add more pain to
their already diminished lives.

189
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,864
Why have you done this?

190
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:42,406
Don't you feel the heat?
'Cause I do.

191
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:44,909
I can't tolerate the sun...

192
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:48,708
what it's doing to me and
what it's doing to all of us...

193
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,441
and all life on earth.

194
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:54,076
We must return to the compound.

195
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,050
Keep the weapon if it
comforts you.

196
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:12,300
Mr. Douglas. First of all.
For the sake of propriety.

197
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:15,567
I would like
to present my children.

198
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,871
Hello. I am Waggdi.

199
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:25,319
How do you do. Sir?
I'm Azazello.

200
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:31,089
My name is M'Ling.

201
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,252
You've already met
my beautiful daughter. Aissa.

202
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,126
Majai. Present yourself. Please.

203
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,900
He means you no harm.
Mr. Douglas.

204
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,101
He's just trying to be polite.

205
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,371
He just wants
to shake your hand.

206
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,023
Thank you.

207
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:08,595
This is the most outrageous
spectacle I have ever witnessed.

208
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,390
Look at yourself!

209
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,898
I understand
that I must be shocking to you.

210
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:16,400
However.
I must also point out...

211
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:19,836
that I've an allergy
to the sun.

212
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:23,465
And that's why I have put
this medication on.

213
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,134
Look at these people!

214
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,477
Look at him!

215
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,179
Mr. Douglas...

216
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:42,026
I don't think that I have
the intellectual ability...

217
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:47,031
to condense 17 years
of study and experiment...

218
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:51,865
into 17 minutes of explanation.

219
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,770
For the moment. It will
have to suffice to say...

220
00:34:55,943 --> 00:35:00,346
that the people
that you witnessed before...

221
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,245
living under my care
and protection...

222
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:08,411
are animals that have
been fused with human genes...

223
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,319
in the course of a series
of scientific studies...

224
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,790
designed by myself.

225
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,895
Wow.
Have you ever considered...

226
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:18,156
that you might have
totally lost your mind?

227
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:21,631
I mean. This is just satanic.

228
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:27,173
"Judge not.
That ye be not judged.

229
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:30,674
"For by these judgments
shall ye also be judged.

230
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:34,645
"And let he who hath not sinned
cast the first stone. "

231
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:39,617
"'There is no peace. ' saith
the Lord. 'unto the wicked. "'

232
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:42,688
I think perhaps this is
not the time to continue.

233
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,757
We'll have dinner at 8.

234
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:47,554
I hope that you'll be
in another state of mind...

235
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,286
and be more receptive.

236
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,642
"Somewhere
in sands of the desert...

237
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,007
"a lion body and head of man...

238
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,775
"is moving its slow thighs.

239
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:19,943
"The darkness drops again.

240
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:23,579
"But now I know that
20 centuries of stony sleep...

241
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:27,489
"were vexed to a nightmare
by a rocking cradle.

242
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,893
"And what rough beast.
Its hour come round at last.

243
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:36,059
"Slouches towards Bethlehem
to be born?"

244
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:39,331
M'Ling. That was just beautiful.

245
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,498
Thank you so much.
Let's toast.

246
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,473
To your health.

247
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:52,475
Well. Mr. Douglas.
Very good of you to join us.

248
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:56,145
Please tell me.
Is the Devil still pursuing you?

249
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:03,354
What do you mean by the Devil?

250
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,329
You seem to be
on terms with him.

251
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,594
Permit me to tell you
something of the Devil...

252
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,034
as I've come to know him.

253
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,835
The Devil is that element
in human nature...

254
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,878
that makes you
destroy and debase.

255
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,174
What are you about
on this island...

256
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,408
but destruction and debasement?

257
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,576
Well. I could tell you
very plainly.

258
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,745
No. Please don't do that.
No. No.

259
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:34,155
For 17 years.
I have been striving...

260
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:37,354
to create some measure
of refinement...

261
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:40,864
in the human species.
You see.

262
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,970
And it is here.
On this very island.

263
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:48,268
That I. Sir. Have found
the very essence of the Devil.

264
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:50,307
What do you mean?

265
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:53,504
I have seen the Devil
in my microscope.

266
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,081
And I have chained him.

267
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,582
I suppose you could say.

268
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,880
In the sense
metaphorically speaking.

269
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:04,047
I've cut him to pieces.

270
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:09,059
The Devil. Mr. Douglas.
I have found...

271
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:15,691
is nothing more than
a tiresome collection of genes.

272
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,500
It is with great assurance
that I can tell you...

273
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:24,906
that Lucifer...
son of morning...

274
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:28,279
is no more.

275
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:35,920
I don't see how
any of this specious nonsense...

276
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,924
justifies
these monstrous disfigurements.

277
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:45,430
Very simply. They represent
a stage in the process...

278
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,932
of eradicating
destructive elements...

279
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:51,094
found in the human psyche.

280
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:56,940
And I have almost
achieved perfection. You see.

281
00:39:57,111 --> 00:40:02,947
Of a divine creature
that is pure. Harmonious.

282
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:06,644
Absolutely incapable of malice.

283
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,880
If in my tinkering...

284
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:12,082
I have fallen short
of the human form...

285
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:15,422
by the odd snout. Claw. Or hoof.

286
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:19,589
It really is of no great import.

287
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:27,631
I am closer than you could
possibly imagine. Sir.

288
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,148
What's that?

289
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:46,555
Rabbit fricassee. Master.

290
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,354
Stop that! Oh. God.

291
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,360
Get this out of my sight!

292
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,362
Azazello.
Who's responsible for this?

293
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,558
Mr. Montgomery requested it.

294
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:57,295
Oh. Go to the kitchen.
Leave.

295
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:00,065
All of you. Go wash your hands.

296
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:07,113
Mr. Montgomery considers this
a source of amusement...

297
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:08,714
I suppose.

298
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,180
No one saw me kill it...

299
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:13,175
except you.

300
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:18,718
Well.
I have no way of knowing.

301
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,588
What do you mean?

302
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:24,219
We saw one in the forest
with its head torn off.

303
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,765
And who was responsible
for that?

304
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,335
It was Lo-Mai.

305
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:33,029
Good God.

306
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,309
You bloody fool.

307
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:46,550
I want everyone outside
in the compound tomorrow.

308
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,746
And. Mr. Douglas.
Perhaps we can entertain you...

309
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,551
a little more
than you anticipated.

310
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,750
We'll have a trial tomorrow.

311
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,674
Not to kill for pleasure.

312
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,901
Not to kill for hatred.

313
00:43:54,014 --> 00:44:00,214
Not to kill anything. Anytime.
That is the law.

314
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,447
That law has been broken.

315
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:07,651
None escape. None escape.

316
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,921
None shall escape.

317
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,960
Who is he?

318
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,372
Who has done this?

319
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:27,970
Evil is he who breaks the law.

320
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:34,043
Do you hear. Lo-Mai?

321
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,997
Do you hear?

322
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:51,301
Lo-Mai.

323
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,079
I forgive you. My son.

324
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:40,310
Father.

325
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:45,589
Lo-Mai has broken the law.

326
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:48,853
He killed a living thing.

327
00:45:57,304 --> 00:45:58,931
Oh. My God!

328
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:01,631
What have you done?

329
00:46:03,477 --> 00:46:05,001
I am sorry. Father.

330
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,739
Didn't you want me to
protect the law?

331
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:12,610
Where did you get this gun?

332
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:22,493
The law is not to kill.

333
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,063
For any reason.

334
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:33,029
See that his body is shown
all manner of respect.

335
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,606
Yes. Master.

336
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:14,199
I saw little of Moreau
as the crisis broke.

337
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,893
He was always
in the laboratory...

338
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:21,700
working to pursue his dream
to create a perfect human race.

339
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:25,641
Nothing was said
of my attempted escape.

340
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:29,145
Montgomery. Who had once been
a brilliant neurosurgeon.

341
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:32,149
Was reduced to being
the beast people's jailer.

342
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,152
And now
he had become mine. Too.

343
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:38,155
It's turned
completely yellow.

344
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:50,493
It's almost opaque. See?

345
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:52,332
Jesus!

346
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:55,839
Nothing.

347
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:59,001
So. We'll simply
have to increase the dosage.

348
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,408
Would you get
the inoculation gun. M'Ling?

349
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,856
You bore me.

350
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:22,866
Go. Go.

351
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:24,196
Good girl. Good girl.

352
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:25,395
Hi. Sweetie.

353
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:27,699
What are you
giving them exactly?

354
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:31,207
It's a combination
of endorphins and hormones.

355
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:34,211
Keeps them from retrogressing.

356
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:36,281
Retrogressing into what?

357
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:40,147
Well. It isn't pretty.

358
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,219
It seems
to improve their mood.

359
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,688
That's my contribution.

360
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:48,123
I add a little methamphetamine.
Morphine.

361
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,422
'Shrooms and other shit.

362
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:52,292
Keeps them mellow...

363
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,128
keeps them
coming back for more.

364
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,827
It hasn't brought him back.

365
00:50:58,004 --> 00:50:59,995
- What?
- There.

366
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,310
Come! Come!

367
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,539
It's okay.

368
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:10,307
Come get your shot.

369
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:17,485
Come on.

370
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:23,587
Hyena.

371
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,226
Hyena.

372
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:27,798
Look at my hands.

373
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:31,335
Look. Okay? It's okay.

374
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,132
We won't hurt you.

375
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:35,240
That's right. That's right.
Come on.

376
00:51:38,278 --> 00:51:39,609
Hyena. Come.

377
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:44,743
That's right. Come on.

378
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:50,579
What's th... What?

379
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,918
Pain...

380
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:55,493
no more.

381
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,532
What?

382
00:52:07,674 --> 00:52:09,699
What are you doing?!

383
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:14,080
What's going on?

384
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:16,511
- Christ. He pulled it out.
- What?

385
00:52:16,683 --> 00:52:18,674
He pulled out his implant.

386
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:22,185
They have implants so we
can shock them into submission.

387
00:52:22,355 --> 00:52:24,050
We must find him.

388
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,692
Dart him. And get him
back to the compound.

389
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:31,027
A hunt. Master. Hunt.

390
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:33,530
Yeah. Hunt.

391
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,191
Azazello likes a good hunt.

392
00:52:56,189 --> 00:52:57,816
Get him! Get him!

393
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:15,070
This is bio station Helix.
Calling on all channels.

394
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:17,472
Is anybody receiving me?

395
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:20,078
Are you sure
you know how to use this?

396
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:22,738
Yes. I make many calls
for the doctor.

397
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:28,084
I read the books and learn.

398
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:29,745
I make it work.

399
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:34,557
Not without this you don't.

400
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:57,272
Fetch.

401
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,092
Who do you think you'll call?

402
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:26,641
What'll you say when you get
somebody on the horn?

403
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:30,249
"Mayday. Mayday. I'm being held
captive by a pig lady"?

404
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,583
You'll sell Aissa to the circus?

405
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:43,957
You know. She's not like... us.

406
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,666
She's very delicate.
They all are.

407
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:51,667
But she needs her shots. Too.

408
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,831
And she's not going to get them
off this island.

409
00:54:57,344 --> 00:55:00,438
There's so much
you don't understand.

410
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:02,672
Why don't you smoke this?

411
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:04,840
Maybe you'll start.

412
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,086
There's no way off the island.
You must face the fact.

413
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:19,197
Why was I brought here?

414
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:21,596
I was brought here. Wasn't I?

415
00:55:27,874 --> 00:55:30,001
I can't find the Hyena-Swine.

416
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:35,011
I think we should. Before
the others get the same idea.

417
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:09,246
Oh. My word.
You startled me.

418
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:11,407
How are you?

419
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:14,250
How are you?

420
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:19,256
I think I'm just simply going
to perish from this heat.

421
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:20,757
I cannot bear it.

422
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:24,761
The longer that I'm here.
The worse it gets.

423
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:27,764
And I... I mean.
This damn Montgomery...

424
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:30,266
won't fix anything.

425
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:31,927
And I... I'm dying of heat.

426
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:40,277
I think that... yes.
My caloric converter is empty.

427
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,280
Would you fill it. Please?

428
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,509
Yes. That's much better.

429
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:52,290
God. Yes. Oh. Yes. God!

430
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:54,791
Oh. Please.

431
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:56,826
Forcefully. Forcefully.

432
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,697
My God!

433
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,667
Not so strong!

434
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,602
You have no idea
how strong you can be.

435
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:09,674
You must be very careful.

436
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,902
Father. I must talk to you.

437
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:13,477
Of course.

438
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,042
What?

439
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,185
I'm changing.

440
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,794
There's nothing
to be frightened of. Darling.

441
00:57:28,962 --> 00:57:31,795
Now. Let me see.

442
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:34,832
Yes. There are a few changes.

443
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:37,026
Let me have a look.

444
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,831
Your ears are developing.

445
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:41,268
I'm hideous.

446
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,841
No. Darling. How can you
say that?

447
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,978
You're an absolute angel.

448
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:48,171
You're beautiful inside.

449
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:50,339
You're beautiful outside.

450
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:53,350
You're
an extraordinary creature.

451
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,919
Help me.

452
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,783
These small things...

453
00:57:56,956 --> 00:58:00,050
are just a question
of chemical imbalances.

454
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,488
That's all.

455
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:03,652
No. No. Don't be upset.

456
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,525
I want to be like you.

457
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:10,098
Will I never be like you?

458
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,363
Well. I hope not!

459
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:15,030
I mean. How would you look
if you were like me?

460
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:19,609
You see?
I've made you smile.

461
00:59:50,136 --> 00:59:51,467
What a surprise.

462
00:59:51,638 --> 00:59:54,072
I didn't mean to startle you.

463
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,472
I thought I heard someone
stirring about down here.

464
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,977
And I thought I'd come look.

465
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:04,480
You know. I did hear you.
It's rather late. You see.

466
01:00:04,651 --> 01:00:07,484
I heard...
Would you like a biscuit?

467
01:00:07,654 --> 01:00:10,214
No.

468
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,483
I was listening to this music.

469
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:13,990
It was interesting...

470
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,152
Did you. Were you playing?

471
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,864
Well. Perhaps it was you.

472
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,367
Well. In any event. You see.

473
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,505
It reminded me
of a man named Schoenberg...

474
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:28,368
this sort of music...

475
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,509
I'd like to
demonstrate something...

476
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:33,510
which might interest you.

477
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,376
No. You can all
just. Just relax and. And...

478
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:39,677
Well. You see...

479
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:44,520
there is a sort of music
called twelve-tone music.

480
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:46,181
And it sounds...

481
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,021
sort of like that. You see?

482
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:53,029
But there is
another kind of music.

483
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:57,033
And there is a man
named George Gershwin...

484
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:58,693
who played this.

485
01:01:19,726 --> 01:01:21,717
Lovely.

486
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,364
I know. My son.

487
01:01:35,742 --> 01:01:40,145
Father.
I must ask a question.

488
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,612
Please.

489
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,081
What am I?

490
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:51,588
We call you Father.
Yet we are not like you.

491
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:53,749
What are we?

492
01:01:56,763 --> 01:02:00,096
You are...
you are my children.

493
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:03,099
You are all my children.
You see?

494
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:06,602
Now. I think perhaps it might
be helpful...

495
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,764
if we could go over there.

496
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:11,273
Then we could discuss this.

497
01:02:11,444 --> 01:02:13,605
And I could explain
to you exactly...

498
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,611
Now. Be calm. Please.

499
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:21,982
I want to tell you
something very important.

500
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,715
Just everyone be calm.

501
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:29,453
And just relax and be seated
if you would. Please...

502
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,119
because...

503
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:33,128
you see. One of
the things that...

504
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:36,097
Tell me...

505
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:39,136
why you make the pain...

506
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:41,671
if we are your children?

507
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,006
You see.
You are my children.

508
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,114
But law is necessary.

509
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:54,680
If there is no more pain...

510
01:02:59,091 --> 01:03:03,187
then. Is there no more law?
Hm?

511
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,927
There is always law.

512
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,541
- Pain no more.
- Good God.

513
01:03:31,824 --> 01:03:33,416
What are you doing?

514
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:35,959
To walk on all fours.

515
01:03:36,128 --> 01:03:40,963
That is the law.

516
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:45,968
To slurp up our drink.
That is the law.

517
01:03:46,138 --> 01:03:48,698
We are not men.

518
01:03:56,182 --> 01:04:01,381
To eat flesh and fish
anytime.

519
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:09,760
That is the law!

520
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:16,261
Now I am the law.

521
01:04:51,003 --> 01:04:54,769
None shall escape.

522
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:58,502
That is the law.

523
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:10,072
Is there still law?

524
01:06:10,249 --> 01:06:14,652
There's still law. Yes.

525
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:21,449
How can there be law
without the Father?

526
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:25,225
He hasn't left us.

527
01:06:26,499 --> 01:06:28,990
That is
what I'll tell the others.

528
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:35,832
That his spirit
is watching over us.

529
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:38,704
We must wait for a sign.

530
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,479
It's all right.

531
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,847
Were it not for you.

532
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:23,853
I should say that
your father had failed...

533
01:07:24,023 --> 01:07:25,388
terribly.

534
01:07:32,998 --> 01:07:35,694
But you're not
the same as them.

535
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:42,129
Nor are you the same as me.

536
01:07:45,244 --> 01:07:49,271
You are something far.
Far finer.

537
01:07:58,124 --> 01:08:00,092
It's the process.

538
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,792
I'm changing.

539
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:09,332
There's a serum Montgomery
used to give me.

540
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,493
It's in the lab.

541
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,497
It can stop my regression.

542
01:08:18,144 --> 01:08:23,013
Please... help me.

543
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:30,342
"Judge not.
That ye be not judged.

544
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:32,848
"For with
what judgment ye judge.

545
01:09:33,018 --> 01:09:34,349
"Ye shall be judged:

546
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,351
"And with what measure
ye meet.

547
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:38,854
"It shall be measured
to you again.

548
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:41,822
"Why beholdest thou the mote
that is in thy brother's eye.

549
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:45,828
"But considerest not the beam
in thine own eye?

550
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:50,332
"Hypocrite! Cast out
the beam in thine own eye.

551
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:52,333
"Then thou shalt see clearly...

552
01:09:52,504 --> 01:09:54,335
"to cast out the mote
of thy brother's eye.

553
01:09:54,506 --> 01:09:56,838
"Neither cast ye your pearls
before swine.

554
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:59,842
"Lest they trample them
under their feet.

555
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:05,473
"And then. Give not that which
is holy unto the dogs. "

556
01:10:05,651 --> 01:10:07,619
What does she need?

557
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,720
Animal or man?

558
01:10:09,889 --> 01:10:11,652
- What am I looking for?
- You're angry.

559
01:10:11,824 --> 01:10:13,815
"Neither cast... "

560
01:10:13,993 --> 01:10:15,824
Listen. Listen.

561
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:17,826
Don't fuck around.

562
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:19,521
What do I need?

563
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,131
What do I need?

564
01:10:25,004 --> 01:10:27,802
Tell me what I need.

565
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:33,805
Where is it? Shut up!

566
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:37,142
Shut up! Where is the serum?

567
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:40,216
Bastard!

568
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:41,978
- Where is the serum?
- Calm.

569
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,644
Who's the animal?

570
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,048
Who's the animal?

571
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:47,522
Be calm. Calm.

572
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:51,185
We've got to think and reason
this through together.

573
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,833
Tell me.

574
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:01,404
I destroyed the serum.

575
01:11:01,573 --> 01:11:04,007
All of it.

576
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:37,572
Hyena.

577
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:47,451
Kill him!

578
01:11:55,995 --> 01:11:58,555
I have the fire that kills.

579
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:12,910
I know where there's more.
Fire that kills.

580
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:15,103
I know where there's more.

581
01:12:25,824 --> 01:12:28,418
Show us...

582
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,893
and we will let you join us.

583
01:12:32,064 --> 01:12:36,524
I want no more pain.

584
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,259
Take it out.

585
01:12:40,906 --> 01:12:43,033
Take it out.

586
01:13:03,262 --> 01:13:05,253
We are not men.

587
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:09,793
That is the law.

588
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:14,301
That is the law.

589
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,129
Burn it.

590
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,048
None shall escape.

591
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,252
"And though I give
my body to be burned...

592
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:14,119
"and have not charity.
I am nothing. "

593
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:21,226
"And though I give all my gifts
to feed the poor...

594
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,733
"and though I give my body
to be burned.

595
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:27,269
"And have not charity.
I am nothing.

596
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,272
"Charity envieth not... "

597
01:16:23,895 --> 01:16:28,229
You know. Sherlock Holmes
once asked Doctor Watson:

598
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,766
"Did you notice
the remarkable thing...

599
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:33,700
"about the dog barking?"

600
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:38,741
Doctor Watson said.
"I heard no dog barking. "

601
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:41,401
Sherlock said:
"That's the remarkable thing. "

602
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:35,057
Hello. Woofer.

603
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:44,441
Well. Things didn't work out.

604
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,438
Moreau wanted to turn
animals into humans...

605
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:51,912
and humans into gods.

606
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:56,248
But it's instinct and reason.
Instinct and reason.

607
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,184
What's instinct to a dog?

608
01:18:01,393 --> 01:18:04,453
To hunt. To kill. Master.

609
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:06,756
To run with the pack.

610
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,424
I want to go to dog heaven.

611
01:19:01,286 --> 01:19:04,915
Now we are men.

612
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:47,763
He said...

613
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:55,029
he was closer to his goal...

614
01:19:57,008 --> 01:19:59,533
than I could possibly imagine.

615
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:03,503
Do you remember?

616
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:12,855
You see. I was led to believe...

617
01:20:13,024 --> 01:20:18,223
he had saved my life...

618
01:20:20,999 --> 01:20:22,990
when. In fact...

619
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:26,494
all the time...

620
01:20:30,008 --> 01:20:31,737
he intended to take it.

621
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:40,349
He intended to...

622
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:42,350
use me.

623
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:45,854
He intended to use my DNA...

624
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:49,482
to stop your regression.

625
01:20:53,999 --> 01:20:55,398
Well. Anyway...

626
01:20:57,636 --> 01:21:00,332
He's dead...

627
01:21:00,505 --> 01:21:03,201
and Montgomery is...

628
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:06,003
insane...

629
01:21:09,514 --> 01:21:11,709
and has...

630
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:17,511
Well. He's destroyed
all the serum.

631
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,010
Go!

632
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,984
Go!

633
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:48,002
The guns.

634
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:46,088
How do you do. Sir?

635
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:48,129
I believe we've met.

636
01:24:50,468 --> 01:24:53,904
Drip. Drap. Drip. Drap.

637
01:24:54,072 --> 01:24:56,597
"Where are you going in
the woods today. Little girl?"

638
01:24:56,775 --> 01:24:58,640
My little kitten.

639
01:25:00,278 --> 01:25:01,643
Fetch!

640
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:39,614
Nicely now. Little kitten.

641
01:25:39,784 --> 01:25:41,274
Or I'll hurt you.

642
01:25:46,424 --> 01:25:48,016
Remember...

643
01:25:48,193 --> 01:25:51,629
Remember
how the master whipped me?

644
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:57,126
He never touched
your soft skin. Did he?

645
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,686
Tell them...

646
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:54,552
that I am the law.

647
01:26:54,726 --> 01:26:56,591
Do not believe him.

648
01:26:56,761 --> 01:26:59,127
He is not the law!

649
01:27:11,542 --> 01:27:13,032
Good doggie.

650
01:27:38,436 --> 01:27:40,267
Five Man.

651
01:27:41,272 --> 01:27:47,142
Please tell them that
I am God.

652
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:15,096
You're right.

653
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,074
You are a god.

654
01:28:19,243 --> 01:28:20,301
No!

655
01:28:23,614 --> 01:28:24,603
Again.

656
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:29,879
You are a god.

657
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,544
You're all gods.

658
01:28:41,532 --> 01:28:43,159
Tell them...

659
01:28:46,037 --> 01:28:50,633
to obey me like
they did the Father.

660
01:28:53,544 --> 01:28:57,378
You all killed the Father.

661
01:28:57,548 --> 01:29:01,245
You all ate his flesh.

662
01:29:02,553 --> 01:29:06,045
So who is the new Father?

663
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:13,258
Who is God Number One?

664
01:29:17,201 --> 01:29:19,635
Who should they obey?

665
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,268
Him?

666
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:28,377
Or him?

667
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,376
You see...

668
01:29:31,549 --> 01:29:37,613
there must be
a God Number One.

669
01:32:05,903 --> 01:32:07,427
Father...

670
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:14,070
why?

671
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:35,356
You stay!

672
01:32:35,533 --> 01:32:39,697
Douglas. You stay here.

673
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:41,997
You stay with us.

674
01:32:42,173 --> 01:32:44,903
I'll be back. I'll be back.

675
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,154
I'll come back.

676
01:32:58,322 --> 01:33:01,814
There must be people
who can...

677
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:08,623
Well. Doctors. Scientists...

678
01:33:08,799 --> 01:33:11,825
who understand
what Moreau was trying to do.

679
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:14,528
They could develop
a serum. Stop the regression.

680
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:19,031
No more scientists.

681
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:23,306
No more laboratories. No more
experiments.

682
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:27,450
I thought you'd understand that.

683
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:33,847
We have to be what we are...

684
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:36,892
not what the Father tried
to make us.

685
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,465
To go on two legs...

686
01:33:46,637 --> 01:33:48,605
is very hard.

687
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:59,039
Perhaps four is better anyway.

688
01:34:53,404 --> 01:34:58,740
This is a true record
of what I saw...

689
01:34:58,909 --> 01:35:03,812
leaving out only the latitude
and longitude of the island...

690
01:35:03,981 --> 01:35:08,941
as a warning to all who'd
follow in Moreau's footsteps.

691
01:35:11,922 --> 01:35:16,757
Most times I keep the memory
far in the back of my mind.

692
01:35:16,927 --> 01:35:20,260
A distant cloud.

693
01:35:20,431 --> 01:35:24,765
But there are times when
the little cloud spreads...

694
01:35:24,935 --> 01:35:28,268
until it obscures the sky.

695
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:32,273
At those times.
I look about at my fellow men.

696
01:35:32,443 --> 01:35:34,274
And I'm reminded
of some likeness...

697
01:35:34,445 --> 01:35:37,278
to the beast people.

698
01:35:37,448 --> 01:35:41,282
I feel as though the animal
is surging up in them.

699
01:35:41,452 --> 01:35:44,285
And they're neither
wholly animal nor wholly man.

700
01:35:44,455 --> 01:35:47,788
But an unstable
combination of both.

701
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:52,952
As unstable as anything
Moreau created.

702
01:35:56,467 --> 01:36:01,029
And I go... in fear.
