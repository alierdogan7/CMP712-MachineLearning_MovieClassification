He's someone who was with a whole
lot of someones who didn't listen.

183
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,903
We can make a deal

184
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,872
right here, right now.

185
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:31,126
That's right, we can.

186
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:33,529
Give us all your stuff.

187
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:35,197
We'll probably
have to kill one of you.

188
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,498
That's just the way it is,

189
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,035
<i>but then we can start
moving forward on business.</i>

190
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,805
<i>All you have to do is listen.</i>

191
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,675
Yeah...

192
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:51,597
that deal's not gonna work for us.

193
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,351
Fact is, I was about to ask
for all of<i> your</i> stuff,

194
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,555
only I'm thinking I don't
have to kill any of you.

195
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:02,608
Any<i> more</i> of you.

196
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,197

197
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,656
Savior: Sorry, my deal
is the only deal.

198
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,190
We don't negotiate.

199
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,232
Me and my people are leaving.

200
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,570
Okay, friend.

201
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,573
Plenty of ways to get
to where you're going.

202
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,184
You want to make today
your last day on Earth?

203
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,422
No,

204
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,957
but that is a good thing to bring up.

205
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,511
Think about it.

206
00:16:13,814 --> 00:16:16,598
What if it's the last day
on Earth for you?

207
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:19,968
<i>For someone you love?</i>

208
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,770
<i>What if that's true?</i>

209
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,675
Maybe you should be extra nice

210
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,711
to those people in that RV,

211
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,979
'cause you never know...
(snaps fingers)

212
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,182
Just like that.

213
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,087
Be kind to each other.

214
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,988
Like you said...

215
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,859
like it was your last day on Earth.

216
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,899
You do the same.

Why didn't you stay back

223
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,033
I owe her.

224

<i>Why did you come?</i>

225
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,842
I owe them.

226
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,781
Logrun Road's a straight shot.

Sasha:
<i>We want visibility.</i>

228
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,989
There, you got it on Shelton.

<i>Golf course, country
clubs, sloping terrain.</i>

230
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,160
No bum rush from the bogeyman.

231
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:34,962
We'd see them from a good piece.

232
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,463
It is a longer trip by a third,

233
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,499
but we'd get the scenic safety

234
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,467
of clear-cut dingles
and glens.

235
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:44,738
You're being serious, right?

236
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,107
As coronary thrombosis.

237
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,642

- Yeah.

Daryl, some of the others...

243
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,979
they would've.

244
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,149
They were gone before
they even knew about you.

245
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,517
Gone?

246
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,186
They'll be back by the time we are.

247
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:36,323
Probably back already, wondering.

248
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,692
You think I'm being dramatic here?

249
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,780
Do you really think
you could just come here

250
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,332
and tell me to come back
and that's how it'll go?

251
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:52,573
Those people, your people,

252
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,074
they care about you.

253
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:57,578
I know they do.
And I care about them.

254
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,179
That's why I can't be there.

255
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:01,749
That's why you have to be there.

After everything that's happened.

259
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,201
If you care about people,
there are people to protect,

260
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,655
there are people
that you will kill for.

261
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:28,275
If you don't want to kill...

262
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,362
or if you can't...

263
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,084
then you have to get away from them.

264
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,585
You do not get both.

265
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,755
You-- you should know that.

266
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,425
No, everything's about people.

267

Everything in this life
that's worth a damn,

268
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,763
that's what I know.

269
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,219

No, I can't do that.

273
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,448
It's not your decision.
Just go.

274
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,318
I'm not leaving you.

Please, just go.

If you care

There is a price, Morgan,
and you're gonna pay it.

280

Just asking if you could do that.

00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:15,146
(whistling continues)

547
00:49:09,286 --> 00:49:11,069
Savior:
<i>Good.</i>

548
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:13,488
You made it.

549
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:17,158
Welcome to where you're going.

550
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:25,000
We'll take your weapons.

551
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:26,584
Now.

552
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:34,676
- We can talk about--
- We're done talking.

553
00:49:34,678 --> 00:49:36,728
Time to listen.

554
00:49:57,117 --> 00:49:59,034
That's yours, right?

555
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:05,090
Yeah, it's yours.

556
00:50:10,514 --> 00:50:13,548
Okay.

557
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,718
Let's get her down and get
you all on your knees.

558
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,438
Lots to cover.

559
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,223
Hold up.

560
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:24,101
We got it.

561
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,062
Sure, sure.

562
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:04,432
Gonna need you on your knees.

563
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:40,532
<i>(people breathing heavily)</i>

564
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:48,673
<i>(muffled voice)</i>

565
00:51:50,043 --> 00:51:52,010
- Savior: <i>Dwight!</i>
- Dwight:<i> Yeah.</i>

566
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:53,495
Savior:
<i>Chop-chop.</i>

567
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:02,337
Dwight:
Come on.

568
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,422
You got people to meet.

569
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:17,185
(grunting)

570
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,742
Maggie?

571
00:52:23,744 --> 00:52:25,777
Dwight:
<i>On your knees!</i>

572
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,371
Savior:
<i>All right!</i>

573
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:38,456
We got a full boat.

574
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,793
Let's meet the man.

575
00:52:41,795 --> 00:52:43,428
(knocks)

576
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:02,898
Pissing our pants yet?

577
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:12,123
Boy, do I have a feeling
we're getting close.

578
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:21,633
Yep.

579
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:25,170
It's gonna be pee-pee pants
city here real soon.

580
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:31,643
Which one of you pricks
is the leader?

581
00:53:31,645 --> 00:53:32,844
Savior:
<i>It's this one.</i>

582
00:53:35,148 --> 00:53:37,098
He's the guy.

583
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:41,937
(sighs)

584
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:49,828
Hi.

585
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,080
You're Rick, right?

586
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:54,749
I'm Negan.

587
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:58,420
And I do not appreciate
you killing my men.

588
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:01,423
Also, when I sent my people

589
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:04,376
to kill your people
for killing my people,

590
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:06,878
you killed more of my people.

591
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:11,683
Not cool.

592
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,351
Not cool.

593
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:16,855
You have no idea

594
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,890
how not cool that shit is.

595
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:23,061
But I think you're gonna
be up to speed shortly.

596
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:27,565
Yeah.

597
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:32,821
You are so gonna regret
crossing me in a few minutes.

598
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,375
Yes, you are.

599
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,081
You see, Rick, whatever you do,

600
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:46,384
no matter what, you don't mess
with the new world order.

601
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:49,421
And the new world order is this,
and it's really very simple.

602
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:53,008
So, even if you're stupid,
which you very may well be,

603
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,644
<i>you can understand it.</i>

604
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:57,896
<i>You ready?</i>

605
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:01,599
Here goes.
Pay attention.

606
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,777
Give me your shit...

607
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:14,779
or I will kill you.

608
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,419
Today was career day.

609
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:24,873
We invested a lot

610
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:29,711
so you would know who I am
and what I can do.

611
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:34,132
You work for me now.

612
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:37,469
You have shit, you give it to me.

613
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,554
That's your job.

614
00:55:40,974 --> 00:55:45,443
<i>Now, I know that is a mighty big,</i>

615
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:48,229
<i>nasty pill to swallow,</i>

616
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:53,568
but swallow it
you most certainly will.

617
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,290
You ruled the roost.

618
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:03,578
You built something.

619
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:07,799
<i>You thought you were safe.</i>

620
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,835
<i>I get it.</i>

621
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:14,556
<i>But the word is out.</i>

622
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:19,511
You are not safe.

623
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:23,348
Not even close.

624
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,850
In fact, you are pegged,

625
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:27,852
more pegged if you don't
do what I want.

626
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:30,572
And what I want is half your shit.

627
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:33,942
<i>And if that's too much, you can
make, find, or steal more,</i>

628
00:56:33,944 --> 00:56:36,528
<i>and it'll even out sooner or later.</i>

629
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:42,667
This is your way of life now.

630
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:46,838
The more you fight back,
the harder it will be.

631
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:52,210
So, if someone knocks on your door...

632
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,046
(chuckles)

633
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:56,347
...you let us in.

634
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,384
We own that door.

635
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:01,686
You try to stop us

636
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:05,106
and we will knock it down.

637
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,727
You understand?

638
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,567
What, no answer?

639
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,407
You don't really think that you
were gonna get through this

640
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:24,742
without being punished, now, did you?

641
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:28,963
<i>I don't want to kill you people.</i>

642
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:31,466
<i>Just want to make that
clear from the get-go.</i>

643
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,919
I want you to work for me.

644
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:38,923
You can't do that if
you're dead, now, can you?

645
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:45,096
I'm not growing a garden.

646
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:52,654
But you killed my people,
a whole damn lot of them.

647
00:57:52,656 --> 00:57:54,856
More than I'm comfortable with.

648
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:58,643
And for that, for that
you're gonna pay.

649
00:58:02,582 --> 00:58:04,716
<i>So, now...</i>

650
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:12,290
I'm gonna beat the holy hell
outta one of you.

651
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:21,132
This--

652
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:23,768
this is Lucille,

653
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:28,223
and she is awesome.

654
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:39,651
<i>All this, all this
is just so we can pick out</i>

655
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:43,204
which one of you gets the honor.

656
00:58:47,911 --> 00:58:49,160
<i>(Negan inhales sharply)</i>

657
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,803
Huh.

658
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,307
Ugh, I gotta shave this shit.

659
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:11,900
You got one of our guns.

660
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:18,690
Whoa. Yeah.

661
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:21,025
You got a lot of our guns.

662
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:28,333
Shit, kid, lighten up.

663
00:59:29,953 --> 00:59:32,203
At least cry a little.

664
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,458
(chuckles)

665
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,463
Ahem.

666
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:47,518
(sniffles)

667
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:52,890
Jesus.

668
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:55,643
You look shitty.

669
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:59,280
I should just put you
out of your misery right now.

670
00:59:59,282 --> 01:00:01,950
Glenn:
No! No!

671

God--!
(grunting)

673
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,541
Nope.

674
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:14,045
- Nope, get him back in line.
- Glenn:<i> No.</i>

675
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:16,831
(grunts)
No.

676
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,082
<i>No.</i>

(sobs, yells)

679
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:30,011
Don't.

680
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:31,479
<i>Don't.</i>

(chuckles)

682
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,901
All right, listen.

683
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:40,855
Don't any of you do that again.

684
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:44,525
I will shut that shit down,
no exceptions.

685
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:47,912
First one's free.

686
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:52,116
It's an emotional moment, I get it.

687
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:09,467
Sucks, don't it?

688
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,304
The moment you realize
you don't know shit.

689
01:01:28,288 --> 01:01:30,738
This is your kid, right?

690
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:35,326
(laughs)

691
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,729
This is definitely your kid.

692
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:40,882
- Just stop this!
- Hey!

693
01:01:40,884 --> 01:01:44,802
Do not make me kill the
little future serial killer.

694
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,888
Don't make it easy on me.

695
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:51,676
I gotta pick somebody.

696
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:55,430
Everybody's at the table
waiting for me to order.

697
01:01:58,651 --> 01:02:03,104
(whistling)

698
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:17,668
I simply cannot decide.

(chuckles)

700
01:02:23,843 --> 01:02:26,043
I got an idea.

cut the boy's other eye out

and then we'll start.
