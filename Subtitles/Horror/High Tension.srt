I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.

I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.

00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:08,868
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.

I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.

9
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:23,466
I WON'T LET ANYONE COME BETWEEN US ANYMORE.

10
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:27,687
ARE THEY RECORDING?

20
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,849

00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,379
(Alex)
WE'RE ALMOST AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE, SLEEPYHEAD.

26
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,265
I DON'T BELIEVE THE DREAM I JUST HAD.

27
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,267
I WAS IN A FOREST RUNNING BAREFOOT.

28
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:14,270
I WAS HURT,
AND I WAS BEING FOLLOWED BY SOMEBODY, AND...

29
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,940
WELL, THE MORE I RAN,
THE MORE I COULD SENSE HIM COMING CLOSER.

30
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,358
WHO WAS THE GUY STALKING YOU?

31
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,643
IT WASN'T A GUY, IT WAS ME.
THAT'S THE WEIRDEST PART.

32
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:22,395
IT WAS ME RUNNING AFTER ME.

33
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,480
DON'T YOU EVER HAVE NORMAL DREAMS?

34
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,481
NO.

35
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,320
BEING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS A BORE.

36
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,740
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE PARTIED SO MUCH.
I FEEL SHITTY.

37
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,742
TAKE A REST. 
I'LL WAKE YOU WHEN WE GET THERE.

38
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,243
REAL FUNNY.

39
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,745
I'LL DRIVE IF YOU LIKE.

40
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,296
[scoffing]
LIKE LAST FRIDAY

41
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:42,799
OH, COME ON,
IT WAS LATE, AND I WAS TIRED.

42
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,551
TIRED? MORE LIKE WASTED.

43
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,004
WELL, IT WAS YOUR FAULT FOR DUMPING ME FOR 3 HOURS

44
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:50,089
AND DISAPPEARING WITH GOD KNOWS WHO.

45
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,091
[chuckles]

46
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,093
I HOPE AT LEAST, THAT HE WAS WORTH IT.

47
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,095
HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

48
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,096

ASSHOLE!

51
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,434
BIMBO!
BITCH!

52
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,019
SKANK!
YOU'RE A PIG.

53

[sighs]

54
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,775
ARE THERE ANY COOL PLACES TO GO OUT HERE IN THE COUNTRY?

55
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,277
I'M AFRAID THE TOWN HALL IS ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE.

56
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,247
WOW, IF I HAD TO LIVE HERE ALL YEAR ROUND,
I THINK I'D SHOOT MYSELF.

57
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:19,085
WELL, IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE.
BESIDES, REMEMBER

58
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,704
WE'RE HERE TO STUDY,
NOT TO PARTY.

59

[music blaring on stereo]

60
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,509

61
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,677
(Alex)
CHILL OUT, MARIE.

62
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:28,961
OH.

COME ON, HENDRIX.
COME ON. COME ON.

67
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,311
I'M GONNA GET YOU.
BOOM, BOOM.

68
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,396
I'LL GET YOU, HENDRIX.

BOOM, BOOM.

70
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,768
TOM, STOP SHOUTING.
GO INSIDE.

71
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,186
YOU'RE GIVING ME A HEADACHE.

72
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,021
I'M JUST WAITING FOR ALEX TO GET HERE.

73
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,296
SHE'LL BE HERE BY THE TIME YOU TAKE YOUR BATH.

74
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:35,445
NO, I CAN'T.
ALEX HASN'T SEEN THE COWBOY.

75
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,747
ALL RIGHT,
GO INSIDE, TAKE YOUR BATH,

76
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,415
THEN PUT THE COWBOY SUIT ON AGAIN.

77
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:41,334
COME ON, HENDRIX.

78
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,336
[Hendrix barking]

79
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,171

[I Believe by Jamie Dunlap playing]

88
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:49,402
THOUGH I CAN'T SEE YOU FACE TO FACE ?

89
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:56,075
SOMEDAY I'LL BE WITH YOU, I KNOW

90
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,578
AND I BELIEVE

91
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,446
EYES ON THE ROAD.

92
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,949
YOU'VE STILL GOT SOME SARCASM, YOU KNOW.

93
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,537
AND I BELIEVE

94
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,873
THAT IT'S REALLY GONNA COME TO BE

95
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,375
ARE YOU SURE IT'S THIS WAY?

96
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,876
OF COURSE. JUST UP AHEAD.

97
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,878
YOU TURN RIGHT AT THE CORNFIELD.

98
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,880
OH, LOOK, LOOK.
THERE IT IS. TURN RIGHT.

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,383
NOW YOU GO STRAIGHT FOR ABOUT 4 KILOMETERS.

100
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,385
WOW, EASY TO GET LOST.

101
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,888
NOBODY USES THIS ROAD EXCEPT FOR TRACTORS.

102
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,891
4 KILOMETERS OF THIS,
AND IT'S GOODBYE, CAR.

(Alex)
YOU CAN'T ACT THAT WAY

106
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,398
EVERY TIME A GUY TRIES TO TALK TO YOU.

107
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,400
(Marie)
I DON'T ACT THAT WAY WITH EVERYONE.

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,902
COME ON, MARIE,
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME STORY.

109
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,404
AND YOU KNOW IT.

110
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:43,906
STOP!

111
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:44,907
WHAT'S WRONG?

112
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,909
I THINK I SAW SOMEONE.

113
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,629
HEY, THAT'S NOT FUNNY ALEX.

114
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,131
I'M NOT KIDDING.
I SAW SOMEONE IN THE CORNFIELD.

115
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,134
STOP SCREWING AROUND LIKE THAT, WILL YOU?

116
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,641
ALEX, COME BACK, PLEASE.

117
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,645

[owl hooting]

134
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:01,817
ALEX, CUT IT OUT.

135
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,008

[Alex laughing]

143
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,560
COME ON, I AM SICK OF YOUR LITTLE GAME.

144
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,062
DAMN YOU.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

145
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,565
[Alex laughing]
I COULD HAVE LEFT YOU OUT HERE, YOU KNOW.

146
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,567
YEAH, VERY FUNNY.

147
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,068
YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.

NO.

149
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,573
GO ON, LAUGH YOUR HEAD OFF.
VERY FUNNY.

150
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,533
(Alex)
MARIE, REMEMBER,

151
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,535
MY FAMILY JUST MOVED HERE 6 MONTHS AGO.

152
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:55,037
THEIR FRENCH IS WORSE THAN MINE.

153
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,039

I SEE WHY YOU PASSED YOUR EXAMS SO EASILY.

156

YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME HERE.

157
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,601
THERE IS NOT TOO MUCH ELSE TO DO EXCEPT STUDY.

158
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,103
THAT'S RIGHT. THE ONLY REAL EXCITEMENT AROUND HERE

159
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,105
IS WHEN A TRAIN RUNS THROUGH.

160
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,361
[panting]

161
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:20,863

HOW ARE YOU?

DON'T WORRY, HE DOESN'T BITE.

167
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,455
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME OR THE DOG?

POP, MARIE.

170
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,826
NICE TO MEET YOU.

171
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,711
SO NICE TO SEE A PERSON AND NOT JUST A PHOTO OF YOU.

172
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,164
PHOTO?
YOU KNOW, THE ONE I TOOK IN SPAIN.

173
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,132
IT'S ON THE FIREPLACE.
YOU'RE PART OF THE FURNITURE.

174
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,585
AND THIS IS TOM.
HELLO, COWBOY.

175
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,586
AH.

176
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,588
[Alex laughing]
AREN'T YOU HAPPY TO SEE ME?

177
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,473
OF COURSE HE'S HAPPY.

178
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,978
HE INSISTED ON WAITING UP ALL NIGHT FOR YOU.

179
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,482
AND YOUR MOTHER HAS BEEN WORRYING THE WHOLE DAY, OF COURSE.

180
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,983
MOM ALWAYS WORRIES FOR NOTHING.

181
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,985
I THINK SHE LEFT YOU SOMETHING IN THE OVEN.

182
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,987
OH, I TOLD HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

183
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,490
WELL, SHE WASN'T SURE IF YOU WERE GONNA HAVE TIME TO EAT.

184
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,491

187
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,996
RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, THEN.

(Marie)
SO, WHAT WAS THIS PLACE BEFORE?

193
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,125
IT WAS AN OLD FARM THAT MY FATHER RENOVATED.

194
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,627
THERE'RE LOTS OF THEM IN THE AREA.

195
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,629
MOST OF THEM ARE IN RUINS.

196
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,130
IT'S TOO BAD.

197
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,632
THEY'VE LIVED HERE HALF A YEAR NOW.

198
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:31,550
DID THEY HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH NEIGHBORS?

199
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,103
YOU MEAN THE REDNECKS? YEAH.

200
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:37,273
THEY FIRST THOUGHT MY PARENTS WERE HIPPIES
HERE TO MAKE GOAT CHEESE,

201
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,274
BUT THINGS ARE FINE NOW.

202
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:39,275

YOU'RE UPSTAIRS IN THE GUEST ROOM, OK?

209
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,787

220
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,274
OK.

221
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,658

THE HEATER'S ELECTRIC.
DO YOU WANT IT ON?

229
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,762
(Marie)
NO, I CAN DO IT IF I GET COLD.

230
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:43,065
WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK?

231
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,734

THE PROBLEM IS,
HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND

235
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,165
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPLIT UP WITH.

236
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,668
WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED, THEN?

237
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,420
SOMEONE WHO'S TAKEN MUST BE WORTH IT.

238
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,922
I'M SKEPTICAL OF SINGLE GUYS.

241
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,428
I THINK IT'S TOO EASY TO BE A WOMANIZER
WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY TAKEN.

242
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,180
WELL, COULD BE RIGHT, I GUESS.

SHE'S BRAZILIAN.

248
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,026
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER 3 MONTHS.

249
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,027
A BRAZILIAN?

250
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,362
WHAT, IS HE INTO EXOTICISM OR SOMETHING?

251
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,198
WHATEVER. I NEED TO GET A TAN, QUICK.

DON'T START WITH THAT.

258
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,081
YOU'RE GONNA END UP ALONE.

259
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,833
