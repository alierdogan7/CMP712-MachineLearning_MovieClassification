00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,079
I found Father Carlton
this morning.

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,359
He was taken to the hospital,
but he never regained consciousness.

3
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,199
Why was he here?

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,437
He had an appointment
with His Eminence this afternoon.

00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:01,341
[ants stirring]

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,809
[no audible dialog]

7
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,163
Let's talk about our beliefs

8
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,363
and what we can learn
about them.

9
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16,442
We believe...

10
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:19,601
nature is solid
and time a constant.

11
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,120
Matter has substance
and time a direction.

12
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:28,678
There is truth in flesh, huh,
and the solid ground?

13
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,157
The wind may be invisible,
but it's real.

14
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:37,316
Smoke, fire, water, light--
they're different.

15
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:41,876
Not as to stone or steel,
but they're tangible.

16
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:46,553
And we assume time has an arrow
because it is as a clock.

17
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,313
One second is one second
for everyone.

18
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,113
Cause precedes effect.

19
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:55,792
Fruit rots,
water flows downstream,

20
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:58,551
we're born, we age, we die.

21
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:00,629
The reverse never happens.

22
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,269
None of this is truth!

23
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,749
Say good-bye
to classical reality.

24
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,548
Because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level

25
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:11,308
into ghosts and shadows.

26
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:49,538

[typing]

30
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:58,062
From Job's friends insisting
that the good are rewarded

31
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:01,582
and the wicked punished,
to the scientists of the 1930s

32
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,740
proving to their horror, the theorem
that not everything can be proved,

33
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,260
we've sought to impose order
on the universe.

34
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,378
But we've discovered something
very surprising.

35
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,057
While order does exist
in the universe,

36
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:19,617
it is not at all
what we had in mind.

37
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:21,936
[female] Professor Birack,
in relativity,

38
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,895
geometry breaks down
on the cosmic scale

39
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,975
and in quantum physics,
logic breaks down

40
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:27,814
on the submicroscopic scale...

41
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:47,569
What's this?

42
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,009
I don't know.

43
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,728
Birack did that whole series of debates
on the BBC a few years ago.

44
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,647
Oh, with the English priest, right.

45
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,126
Maybe they're planning
another one.

46
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:23,839
[no audible dialog]

47
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,156
He died before his appointment
with the cardinal.

48
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,676
But he left a diary.

49
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:42,154
You-- you must help us.

50
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:47,833
Please.

51
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,911
[sighs]

52
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,505
[male TV announcer]
The discovery of this supernova

53
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:19,543
has immense significance
to the scientific community.

54
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:22,583
Particles collected
date from Precambrian times

55
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:24,422
before man walked on Earth.

56
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,262
Light from the explosion
was hurled through space

57
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:31,740
at 186,000 miles per second,
and is just now reaching us

58
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,700
across the vast expanse
of the universe.

59
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,620
[ants stirring]

60
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,087
He was the Guardian Priest.

61
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,166
Apparently, he lived here
for over 30 years.

62
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,407
Once a week
he would venture out for food.

63
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,725
And every day...

64
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,485
he opened this door.

65
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,203
[clangs]

66
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,597
Built in the 1500s

67
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:59,757
by arrangement
with the Spanish government.

68
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:01,036
Who knew about this?

69
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,516
Only the members
of this forgotten sect--

70
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:06,236
The Brotherhood of Sleep.

71
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,274
There was a vow of silence.

72
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:13,714
Even their very existence
was kept from the Holy See.

73
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,592
The Vatican didn't know?

74
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,032
The Guardian Priest
would keep the secret.

75
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:22,111
And before he died
would pass it on to another.

76
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:25,270
The sect had enormous
power and authority.

77
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,189
Their actions were
never questioned.

78
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,814
Latin.

79
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,414
Some of it's in Latin.

80
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:27,812
Some in Coptic.

81
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:30,412
Greek.

82
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:31,572
Numbers.

83
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:32,972
It's not easy to decipher.

84
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:37,250
The original text has been distorted
over the years.

85
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,410
- Distorted?
- Rewritten.

86
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,609
Writing upon writing
sometimes two or three times.

87
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,328
And improperly erased.

88
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:51,127
You can still see
the old writing underneath.

89
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,126
What is it?

90
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,524
A secret that can
no longer be kept.

91
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:04,523
Do you feel it?

92
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,363
Yes, s-- something.

93
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,562
It was never here before.

94
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,721
It started a month ago.

95
00:14:11,722 --> 00:14:13,201
What started?

96
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:15,800
A change in the Earth...

97
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,040
and the sky.

98
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,199
His power.

99
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,677
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

100
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,237
The whole thing,
it doesn't make sense.

101
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,277
It violates common sense,
that's the whole point.

102
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:29,357
That's what Einstein
couldn't accept.

103
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:30,837
I can't accept it either.

104
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,075
Do you know anything
about spontaneous human combustion?

105
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:35,075
[laughs]
Walter, come on.

106
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:36,514
- There's Schrodinger's cat.
- l know, l know.

107
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,515
So what's the point?

108
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,874
The point is until the cat
is observed by someone

109
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,632
he's not in any definite state,
either alive or dead.

110
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,672
He's in a wave superposition state,
both dead and alive at the same time.

111
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:46,671
Huh?

112
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:49,951
Okay, only when we open the box
and observe the cat

113
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:53,070
does he materialize into reality,
either dead or alive.

114
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:54,270
But it doesn't make sense.

115
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,229
That is the entire
complete point.

116
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,349
lt doesn't make
any common sense.

117
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:00,907
Our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level.

118
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,708
Why do I want a PhD in this?

119
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,467
Particle beam weapons,
research grants.

120
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,626
A millionaire when I'm 40,
now l remember.

121
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:07,546
[giggles]

122
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:14,184
- You're really gonna like this.
- Class cancelled?

123
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:16,783
"Will the following students
please see Professor Birack."

124
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,184
- [male] Shit, there l am.
- [female] Yeah, me too.

125
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,303
No, all of us.

126
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:21,462
And we heard Birack wants us
to cancel our plans for the weekend.

127
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,701
- What?
- That's not all.

128
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:24,822
A couple of biochemistry's finest
are coming with us.

129
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,821
- And someone to translate Latin.
- Coming with us where?

130
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:27,941
I'm gonna have to pull
some strings here.

131
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,020
This is just not gonna happen!

132
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,540
I have serious plans
for the weekend!

133
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,980
Four o'clock, Walter,
Birack's office.

134
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,979
Oh, I gotta ditch Pagles again,
he's not going to like it.

135
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,140
Sleep with him, get an A.

136
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,018
So, what about your plans?

137
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,737
- I was gonna study, actually.
- Yeah, me too.

138
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,296
I'm Brian Marsh,
by the way,

139
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:44,937
since we're spending
the weekend together.

140
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,217
Yeah, l know.

141
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,736
Catherine Danforth.

142
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:48,895
I know.

143
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,054
So, where did
you transfer from?

144
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:55,533
Kneale-- theoretical physics.

145
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:56,773
I came here to study with Birack.

146
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:58,173
You're applied physics, right?

147
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,052
Well, so, why are you taking
Birack for theory?

148
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,131
I want to know
what the math means.

149
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:06,130
Birack's ruthless.
He wants philosophers, not scientists.

150
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,930
Well, I've read his books,
he's a brilliant man.

151
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,569
Just when I think l've got it,
visualized it,

152
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,048
it just all goes away.

153
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,408
I start seeing old-fashioned
classical reality again.

154
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,927
I want the clockwork back.

155
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:20,525
I want to put it all
into a little box,

156
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,646
but whenever l try,
it just, um, slithers out.

157
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:24,925
Mm.

158
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:27,724
Some things aren't changed
by quantum physics, though.

159
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:28,964
Such as?

160
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,403
Well, for instance...

161
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:34,043
every theoretical physicist l know

162
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:37,281
wonders why it is that no one
who looks like you

163
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:42,001
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building.

164
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,480
That's not true and that's
an extremely sexist thing to say.

165
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,319
Confirmed sexist
and proud of it.

166
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,358
Hey... I was just joking.

167
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:58,156
What happened?

168
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,634
You talk numbers,
you get romantic.

169
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,516
You talk people,
you clam up.

170
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:09,514
Just a little miscue,
that's all.

171
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,713
It's not your fault.

172
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,271
I'm sorry.

173
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,871
- l'll see you later.
- Wait.

174
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,710
[sighs] This conversation isn't
what l had in mind.

175
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,670
Can we start over?

176
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,869
- Okay.
- Okay.

177
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:33,386
I was hoping that you would need
some heIp with your theory

178
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,866
and that maybe
we could discuss it over...

179
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,386
over dinner or something?

180
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:42,104
Well, I suppose something
could be arranged.

181
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,624
There are other things that
I need help with...

182
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,823
over dinner.

183
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:52,382
I have volunteered our services
to the archdiocese.

184
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,141
Each of you is
a competent physicist,

185
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,900
even though you don't have
a degree to prove it.

186
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,459
And participating
in this examination

187
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,859
will greatly improve
your classroom averages, I might add.

188
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,097
You'll plan to take
your meals there.

189
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:08,818
We'll bring cots to sleep on.

190
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,015
There are other departments
joining us.

191
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:14,095
Excusae me, sir,
isa there some reason

192
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,255
why you're not telling us
what we're gonna be doing?

193
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,375
In time.

194
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,004
[male] It's your disbelief
that powers him.

195
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:03,002
Your stubborn faith in--
in common sense

196
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,882
that allows his deception.

197
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:10,122
He lives
in the smallest parts of it.

198
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,279
In the atoms.

199
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,439
Smaller.

200
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,320
Invisible.

201
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:23,117
He lives in all of it.

202
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:26,796
In the sum of its parts.

203
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,715
We must translate this book.

204
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:34,754
You must prove it scientifically.

205
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:38,113
Convince the outside world.

206
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:42,072
The outside world doesn't want
to hear this kind of bullshit.

207
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:43,952
Just keep it locked away.

208
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:46,711
You've already managed that
for 2,000 years.

209
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,949
No prison can hold him now.

- Hi.

212
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,866
It's getting cold out here.

213
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,865
I thought this was supposed
to be California.

214
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,665
Did you have
a class tonight or--

215
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,783
- Library.
- Oh.

216
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:16,303
Actually, I was hoping you'd have
a cup of coffee with me again.

217
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:20,062
This is startin'
to become a habit.

218
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:23,661
- Okay.
- Okay.

220
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:18,326
Good morning.

221
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,886
Thank you.

222
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:28,124
- We didn't get much sleep.
- Mmm.

223
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,603
Who needs sleep?

224
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,442
We do, today's Friday.

225
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:36,681
Can I telI you something?

226
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:39,680
- Oh, please don't.
- I want to.

227
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:43,559
[sighs]
Tell me next time.

228
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,518
If there is one.

229
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,119
Or the time after that.

230
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,038
Or... two years from now.
[sighs]

231
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:54,596
Who was he,

232
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:57,235
the one who gave you
such a high opinion of men?

233
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:02,675
I wouldn't like it if either of us
jumped to conclusions.

234
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:06,394
How do you know I was gonna say
what you think l was gonna say?

235
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,313
Because if you don't...

236
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:11,872
I don't wanna know.

237
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:01,539

240
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:42,007
Oh, please don't tell me.

241
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:43,767
This place gives me
the creeps.

242
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:45,007
It was abandoned.

243
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,647
Hm, I never would have guessed.

244
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:48,365
No, l hear it used
to be a beautiful church.

245
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,405
- When?
- In the 1950s.

246
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,204
My husband's parents
used to come here.

247
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,045
And then for some reason
it was cIosed down.

248
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:57,163
- [sighs] Well.
- Yeah.

249
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:58,482
Hmm.

250
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:06,801
Hi, I'm, uh, Leahy,
I'm looking for Birack.

251
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:09,400
Hi, yeah, Brian Marsh,
uh, he's over in-- there he is.

252
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,040
Ah, thanks.

254
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:24,795

- Yes.

- Hi, l'm Paul Leahy.
- Oh, Dr. Leahy.

256
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:29,275
I'm glad you couId come, yes.

257
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:31,315
Well, now, all I really know
about what's going on here

258
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:33,554
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone.

259
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,552
Oh, yeah, we're just
getting organized.

260
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:35,632
- Uh huh.
- lf you have some equipment,

261
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,593
- find a spot over there.
- All right.

262
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,232
We're making this
the central lab.

263
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,431
Oh, sure.

264
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:43,471
Well, what are we,
uh, actually doing here?

265
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,387
You're the only one with any brains
gettin' outta here tonight.

266
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:53,548
Well, I gotta cover for Leahy
over the weekend.

267
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,628
Extra credit seminar-- wow.

268

Oh, Hi, Frank.

269
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:00,786
Don't leave.

270

Excuse me,
I have to set up.

271
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:06,425
- Hi.
- Hello.

272
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:08,785
Frankie, who's that?

273
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:12,103
Susan Cabot--
radiologist, married.

274
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:13,742
Ah, how married?

275
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:14,743
- Very.
- Oh.

276
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,501
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi, l'll be working upstairs.

277
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,140
I want you to set up
the basic panel down here.

278
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,781
Right, uh, what are
you supposed to be testing?

279
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:22,020
I don't know.

280
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,380
Compounds,
basic structures?

281
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,579
When l know, you'll know.

282

00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,052
I really can't believe
this is happening.

289
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:58,251

They're watching us.

295
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:10,848

00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,247

this whole deal's about yet?

I hate to tell you guys,
but this is real bullshit.

nobody's opened this thing yet, right?

for a second.

Could be.

332
00:29:56,587 --> 00:30:00,385
Okay, but I still don't understand why
we're not taking direct samples.

333

Now, a friend of mine at UCLA
did a study of chronic schizophrenics.

355
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:32,104
They're supposed
to have stereotype routines

356
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:34,743
that they repeat
every 20 minutes or so.

357
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,503
You know, Iike a stuck record
in their brains

358
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:38,743
repeating the same phrase
over and over?

359
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:41,622
Well, I have been watching them
on and off all day

360
00:32:41,623 --> 00:32:43,421
and they don't seem
to be making any movements.

361
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:44,860
Theyjust stand there.

362
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:46,100
With those kinds of problems,

363
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,060
I say let 'em stand there
if they want to.

364
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:49,100
Oh.

365
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,499
- Oh.
- You okay?

366
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,898
Yeah, I bumped into something
this afternoon.

367
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:55,898
- It's starting to hurt.
- ProbabIy nerves.

368
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:58,417
It's a bruise, Walter,
you don't bruise from nerves.

369
00:32:58,418 --> 00:32:59,817

I was twelve.

- No, I'm afraid not.

based upon the corrosion sample.

- Yeah.

Well, they can't be that high.

- can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes.

Nobody's really saying much
of anything here.

This whole section's
a kind of history.

419
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,504
Part of it was indecipherable,

420
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:31,264
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it.

421
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:33,303
I managed to piece together
most of it.

422
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:34,903
Okay, it kind ofstarts here.

426
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,700
a god who once walked
the Earth before man

427
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:47,380
that was somehow banished
to the dark side.

428
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:50,898
Apparently the father buried his son
inside the container.

429
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:53,377
This was the section
someone was trying to erase.

430

Now, later on here,
Christ comes to warn us.

431
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:58,816
He was of extraterrestrial
ancestry,

432
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:00,735

Finally, they determined
Christ is crazy.

439
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,678
But he's also gaining power,

440
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,558
converting a lot of people
to his beliefs.

441
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,759
So, they kill him.

But his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilization

443
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:12,876
until man could develop a science
sophisticated enough

444
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:14,596
to prove what Christ was saying.

manage to keep this
a secret for 2,000 years?

448
00:39:21,715 --> 00:39:26,033

to characterize pure evil

in the hearts of men.

00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:34,630
That was more convenient.

452
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:38,069
In that way, man remained
at the center ofthings.

00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,415

469
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:34,054
In a straight line.

481
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:24,840
Some kind of kinetic emission
came out of it.

a signal strong enough,

00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:33,158
it can move other objects
instantaneously across a distance

Why not?

489
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:48,914
They have a right to know that this--
that it-- it's conscious.

490
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:51,073
Not until you prove
that it wasn't something else--

491
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:53,273
a power surge or a draft of air.

492
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,392
All right.

the big history lesson.

Where?

505
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:24,608
She was there.

506
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:26,848
I think somebody
ought to tell her.

what your faith has said

527
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,926
was essentially correct.

528
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:07,563
Suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything.

529
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:11,843
A god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle.

530

Now, every particle has
an antiparticle.

00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:19,321
Its mirror image.

532
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:22,520
Its negative side.

533
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:26,719
Maybe this universal mind

534
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,198
resides in the mirror image,
instead of in our universe,

535
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,197
as we wanted to believe.

536
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,875
Maybe he's anti-God,

537
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,315
bringing darkness
instead of light.

538
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:43,394
Why weren't we told the truth?

539
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:46,474
[chuckles]
Without the technology to confirm,

540
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:49,273
it would have been another legend.

541
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:51,912
But he was our prisoner,
not yours!

542
00:46:53,392 --> 00:46:55,070
We had a resaponsibility

543
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:57,991
to warn the rest ofthe world!

544
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:02,268
Only the corrupt
are listened to now.

545
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:05,988
And they tell us
what we want to hear.

546
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,107
We believe it to be divine light.
[chuckles]

547
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:15,425
Itjust got colder in here.

548
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:18,025
[whispers]
I know.

549
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:20,304
Suddenly, as if--

550
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,944
as if something mov--

551
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:24,783
moved through the room.

552
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:27,703
[no audible dialog]

553
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:36,181
Listen, do you realize
what's going on up there?

554
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:38,379
We are on the brink
ofthe ultimate truth!

555
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,579
Oh, this priest is a real case.

556
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,138
He is Looney Tunes.

557
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:44,377
And l'm beginning to wonder
about Birack too.

558
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:45,578
I'm going back.

559
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:48,337
- Come on, Calder.
- Come on, Frank!

560
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:51,656
You're out ofyour minds!

561
00:47:51,657 --> 00:47:53,015
This is ajoke!

562
00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:55,294
This is caca!

563
00:47:58,695 --> 00:47:59,733
Come on!

564
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:02,453
[door shuts]

565
00:48:05,493 --> 00:48:06,892
[whispers]
Caca.

566
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:15,209
[wind whisatling]

567
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:24,727
[clunk]

568
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:47,160
[crackling]

569
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,799
Yeahh!

570
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,079
Uh, shit.

571
00:49:01,198 --> 00:49:02,117
[yells]

572
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:12,474
[groaning]

573
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:34,828
[keyboard clacking]

574
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:49,024
[creaking]

575
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:51,823
Hello.

576
00:50:03,782 --> 00:50:05,021
[sighs]

577
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:07,739
Where's Wyndham?

578
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:10,339
Uh, he left.

579
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:12,738
When?

580
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:15,417
[Calder]
Oh, about 20 minutes ago.

581
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:18,456
We tried to talk him
out of it, but, uh...

582
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,056
Has anyone seen Susan?

583
00:50:20,057 --> 00:50:22,375
- Who?
- The radiologist.

584
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:23,495
Glasses.

585
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:27,934
[Leahy]
Well, maybe sahe left too.

586
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:30,654
Maybe they both had
the right idea.

587
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:35,372
[beeping]

588
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:49,648
[stirring and crackling]

589
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:06,564
[male] This is not a dream,
not a dream.

590
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:09,842
We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.

591
00:51:10,803 --> 00:51:14,841
We are unable to transmit
through conscious neural interference.

592
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,920
You are receiving
this broadcast asa a dream.

593
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:21,679
We are transamitting
from the year 1-9--

594
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,279
[gasps]

595
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,758
Uh!

596
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:26,158
- Walter.
- What?

597
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,918
- Have you seen Mullins?
- What?

598
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,557
- No.
- Susan?

599
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:31,396
- Who?
- Radiologist, glasses.

600
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:33,476
Come on, man,
I was asleep.

601
00:51:33,477 --> 00:51:35,236
- [sighs]
-We can't find them.

602
00:51:35,237 --> 00:51:36,675
And Wyndham's left.

603
00:51:37,676 --> 00:51:38,995
A couple ofthe others are
talking about leaving.

604
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,034
We're gonna have a meeting
in the lab in half an hour.

605
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:43,113
- Mullins left?
- I don't know.

606
00:51:43,114 --> 00:51:44,793
I'm gonna go downstairs
and look for him.

607
00:51:48,073 --> 00:51:49,712
Well, since I'm up now.

608
00:51:53,832 --> 00:51:55,790
[typing]

609
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:58,869
[distant clunk]

610
00:52:11,987 --> 00:52:14,106
If I don't come back
you can have my Porsche.

611
00:52:25,503 --> 00:52:26,462
[click]

612
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:12,929
[male] You are receiving
this broadcast

613
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,609
in order to alter the events
you are seeing.

614
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,767
Our technology hasa now developed
a transamitter strong enough

615
00:53:18,768 --> 00:53:21,127
to reach your consacious state
of awarenessa.

616
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:22,047
Uh!

617
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:26,445
What were you dreaming?

618
00:53:27,926 --> 00:53:31,124
Your kingdom, Father,
does not include my unconscious.

619
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:33,924
It's mine.

620
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:35,963
l may abuse it
any way I wish,

621
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:39,082
without having
to confess what's in it.

622
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:42,562
Something l haven't told you.

623
00:53:43,642 --> 00:53:45,920
The Brotherhood of Sleep--

624
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:51,198
Anyone in close proximity
has the same dream.

625
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,438
The one you hadjust now.

626
00:53:57,678 --> 00:53:59,317
[creaking]

627
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:20,031
[clears throat]
Excuse me, but l--

628
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,311
[yells]

629
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:24,430
[gagging]

630
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,627
The Guardian Priests had
the dream for years.

631
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:37,987
What does it mean?

632
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,785
A premonition.

633
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:45,464
The dream evolves, unfolds.

634
00:54:45,465 --> 00:54:48,424
We shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep.

635
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:53,382
As if it's pushing
everything else out.

636
00:54:54,783 --> 00:54:57,461
Making room for itself.

637
00:54:58,581 --> 00:54:59,980
Mullins?

638
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,738
Do you think he really
just took off?

639
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:09,498
I mean, like he was actually believing
this whoIe business?

640
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,737
Why is everybody looking
at me that way?

641
00:55:12,738 --> 00:55:14,096
'Cause you're being assholish.

642
00:55:14,097 --> 00:55:16,416
Well, it's very assholish
ofyou to say so.

643
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:18,976
Look, Mullins is probably
off asleep someplace.

644
00:55:18,977 --> 00:55:21,056
Or he's boffing the radiologist.

645
00:55:21,057 --> 00:55:22,135
I hope he's getting laid.

646
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:24,573
I hope they're both on their way
to a nice Chinese restaurant.

647
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:50,327
How can you keep
working like this?

648
00:55:50,328 --> 00:55:54,725
It's 3:30.
No wonder I'm so tired.

649
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,765
I keep getting these figures
in the computer,

650
00:55:56,766 --> 00:55:58,244
but they're not
making any sense.

651
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:00,843
I stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago.

652
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:03,563
No, l mean these equations
are beyond me now.

653
00:56:03,564 --> 00:56:04,963
They're like another language.

654
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:06,283
Mmm.

655
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:09,921
Uh, go get some sleep,
I'll wake you in a half an hour.

656
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:11,841
- Oh, 45 minutes?
- Okay.

657
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,240
[whispers]
Ahh.

658
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:15,480
Hey, are you okay?

659
00:56:16,121 --> 00:56:17,920
[sighs]
Numb.

660
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,358
I know what you mean.

661
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,637
I just want to go home, pretend none
ofthis is really happening.

662
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:26,517
[sighs]
Ohh.

663
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:28,276
What's that?

664
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:29,396
Huh?

665
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:32,556
Oh, it'sjust a bruise
I got somehow.

666
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:33,555
[whispers]
Oh.

667
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,714
Finally stopped hurting.

668
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,474
Almost looks like
a figure of some kind.

669
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,153
You know,
I gotta close my eyes.

670
00:56:40,154 --> 00:56:42,353
- Okay, l'll wake you.
- Thanks.

671
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:57,868
[sighs]

672
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:00,748
Hello.

673
00:57:01,948 --> 00:57:04,547
[sighs] l'm opening the door
ifyou want to stop what you're doing

674
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:06,266
and put your clothes on.

675
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:17,184
Big doings in the lab tonight.

676
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:18,263
There's a meeting.

677
00:57:18,264 --> 00:57:20,422
Oh, give mejust 15 minutes.

678
00:57:20,423 --> 00:57:22,421
- You want me to come back?
- Later.

679
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:26,421
Ohh.

680
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,378
- Any luck?
- Can't find anybody.

681
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:34,498
I'm going up to the lab.

682
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:35,698
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

683
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,056
We're having
a meeting in the lab.

684
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,176
[typing]

685
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:43,136
Lisa.

686
00:57:44,897 --> 00:57:46,775
Mona Lisa?

687
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:54,694
Lisa?

688
00:58:58,477 --> 00:59:01,715
This whole building is gonna have
to be encased in concrete.

689
00:59:01,716 --> 00:59:03,074
No way, a building this size?

690
00:59:03,075 --> 00:59:04,554
I say we launch the fucker
into space.

691
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:05,674
I'm-- I'm hearing something.

692
00:59:06,235 --> 00:59:08,273
[beeping]

693
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:21,989
[groaning]

694
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,989
[gurgling]

695
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:31,667
Where are the others?

696
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,026
I think they've left.

697
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,066
Kelly's asleep,
I didn't want to wake her up.

698
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,825
I'm asking you to stay.

699
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,864
The work that we do
in the next 48 hours is critical.

700
00:59:41,865 --> 00:59:44,223
How many ofyou
have fallen asleep tonight?

701
00:59:44,224 --> 00:59:45,463
Come on, please tell me.

702
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:47,303
Come on, please!

703
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:50,502
You dreamed.

704
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,181
You dreamed about the front
ofthis church.

705
00:59:54,222 --> 00:59:57,099
About a-- a dark figure coming out.

706
00:59:58,101 --> 00:59:59,380
Didn't you...

707
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,819
Didn't you feel it?

708
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:05,218
Not like a dream.

709
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:06,697
Like saomething elsae.

710
01:00:08,058 --> 01:00:08,978
Here.

711
01:00:11,018 --> 01:00:12,615
[Birack]
l had the dream too.

712
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:18,054
This image of something that didn't
seem to belong to my subconscious.

713
01:00:18,055 --> 01:00:21,573
Almost as if I were watching
something prerecorded.

714
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:22,732
Tachyons?

715
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:24,012
[Birack]
One possaibility.

716
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:25,413
[male]
What's that?

717
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,091
It's a Greek word.

718
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,851
It means, "swift one."

719
01:00:29,852 --> 01:00:32,570
So, what is the dream, huh?

720
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,050
Precognition?

721
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:37,049
Previous knowledge
of a future event?

722
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,688
A shared vision of something
that is yet to occur?

723
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:43,247
Caused by that thing downstairs?

724
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:45,047
Perhaps not.

725
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:48,886
Tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light.

726
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:50,326
[Father]
Supposaing it isan't a dream?

727
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:54,005
Supposing it's a message?

728
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:57,764
What ifthese dreams,
premonitions, omens--

729
01:00:57,765 --> 01:01:01,403
What if they're really
visual messaages

730
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,362
sent by other
human beings?

731
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:06,001
Photographs, video signals.

732
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:07,201
From where?

733
01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:08,601
[female]
The future.

734
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:11,360
Anything travelling faster
than the speed of light

735
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,558
would appear to be going
backward in time.

736
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,478
A future scientist
calculates the exact spot

737
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:18,558
that the Earth occupied
in space in the past,

738
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,117
given trajectory and speed.

739
01:01:21,118 --> 01:01:25,675
He then beams
a tachyon signal at that spot,

740
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:29,955
transmitting video information
backwards through time.

741
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:32,874
For us to receive
as electrical impulses.

742
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,194
Neural stimulus.

743
01:01:34,675 --> 01:01:36,993
- Man, oh, man.
- For what purpose?

744
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,832
[Brian]
Could be a warning

745
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,192
to show us
what's going to happen.

746
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:42,311
A sort of...

747
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:46,272
remote camera view
ofthe future.

748
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,589
So that we can change it.

749
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,426
Someone has finally
shown up to tell us.

750
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:05,465
I think it's time we stood up
forwhat we are.

751
01:02:05,787 --> 01:02:07,146
[buzzing]

752
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:09,585
I think there's something
wrong with this.

753
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:10,665
I'm not getting anything now.

754
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:11,664
They've gone dead.

755
01:02:16,743 --> 01:02:17,902
[male]
Maybe the generator's failed.

756
01:02:17,903 --> 01:02:20,501
[male #2] No, it looks more like
the units downstairs have been cut off.

757
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:30,498
[creepy male voice]
Hello? Hello?

758
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,778
Hey, Wyndham!

759
01:02:34,979 --> 01:02:38,896
[creepy voice]
Hello? Hello?

760
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:42,775
Come here, look at this.

761
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,732
I've got a message for you

762
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:56,531
and you're not going to like it.

763
01:02:56,532 --> 01:02:57,972
Look at his chest.

764
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:01,131
[stirring and crackling]

765
01:03:03,131 --> 01:03:05,289
Pray for death.

766
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,048
Jesus Christ!

767
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:39,680
~ Amazing grace ~

768
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:44,958
~ How sweet the sound ~

769
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,156
~ That saved a wretch ~

770
01:03:50,157 --> 01:03:51,157
Calder?

771
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:54,556
~ Like me ~

772
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:56,355
[snap]

773
01:03:57,077 --> 01:04:02,473
~ But now I'm-- ~
[laughs]

774
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:08,913
Calder, no!
[all plead "no!"]

775
01:04:32,106 --> 01:04:34,226
[Father]
Ego...

776
01:04:34,227 --> 01:04:37,945
te absolve in nomine Patris.

777
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:41,423
Et filIie--

778
01:04:47,543 --> 01:04:48,782
Oh.

779
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:54,860
No.

780
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:29,211
[creaking]

781
01:05:29,212 --> 01:05:30,331
Kelly?

782
01:05:30,332 --> 01:05:32,449
[water running]

783
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:33,889
[click, click]

784
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:39,632
[screams]

785
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:48,549
[chattering]

786
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,868
Hey, hey, you guys.

787
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:53,187
- They cut the--
- That's all blocked away there.

788
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:55,267
- [overlapping voices]
- What the hell is happening here?

789
01:06:55,268 --> 01:06:56,667
The back doors are blocked!

790
01:06:56,668 --> 01:06:58,787
[clamoring]

791
01:06:58,788 --> 01:07:00,546
- You okay?
- No.

792
01:07:00,547 --> 01:07:01,825
Check the windows?

793
01:07:01,826 --> 01:07:04,065
[mixed voices]

794
01:07:13,703 --> 01:07:14,742
Uh!

795
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:16,381
[male outside]
What's going on here?

796
01:07:16,382 --> 01:07:18,301
[mixed voices]

797
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:22,260
It's in here,
don't come in here!

798
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,859
[yelling]

799
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,178
[gagging]

800
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,168
[laughing]

801
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:18,324
[gasps]

802
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:22,723
Go, go, go!

803
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,482
Lock the door!

804
01:08:27,324 --> 01:08:29,562
Come on,
get this over here!

805
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:34,920
[commotion outside]

806
01:08:59,275 --> 01:09:01,474
[male laughing]

807
01:09:04,553 --> 01:09:07,072
[Calder laughing]

808
01:10:12,135 --> 01:10:13,574
[exhales]

809
01:10:32,969 --> 01:10:34,647
[groans]

810
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:43,245
[whispering]
The sun's coming up.

811
01:11:16,957 --> 01:11:19,515
[labored breathing]

812
01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:33,551
Normally, I love being
dominated by women.

813
01:11:35,232 --> 01:11:39,351
Lisa, l'm sorry
about what l said before.

814
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:40,830
You don't look Asian at all.

815
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,829
[whispers]
Shit.

816
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,428
I thought I heard Walter.

817
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:58,505
Walter?

818
01:11:59,466 --> 01:12:00,865
Walter!

819
01:12:04,785 --> 01:12:06,223
What the fuck do you want?

820
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:07,742
Where are you?

821
01:12:07,743 --> 01:12:09,303
lf I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

822
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,301
[knocks]

823
01:12:16,302 --> 01:12:19,100
Hey, can you dig through
and get me outta here?

824
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,899
I don't know,
the wall's pretty thick.

825
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,418
Are you all right?

826
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:27,497
Well, that's a relative thing
right now, but yeah.

827
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,017
Wait a second.

828
01:12:39,576 --> 01:12:42,853
They're just standing there outside,
not trying to get in.

829
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:44,653
They've stopped attacking,
for some reason.

830
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,572
Hey, Walter,
where are you exactly?

831
01:12:46,974 --> 01:12:48,292
I'm in this closet.

832
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:51,411
Hey, I think we can get
through with this.

833
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,451
It's gonna take a while.

834
01:12:54,091 --> 01:12:56,610
Walter, we're gonna try
and dig through!

835
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:58,370
How long will it take?

836
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:59,968
[male]
A couple hours.

837
01:12:59,969 --> 01:13:02,529
Oh, great, I'll tell you what,
l'll hang out here anyway.

838
01:13:06,288 --> 01:13:08,886
[banging]

839
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:14,845

01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,199
[laughing]

842
01:13:47,996 --> 01:13:50,995
[hysterical laughing]

843
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:11,829
Well, get ready
to pull me back.

844
01:14:16,949 --> 01:14:17,868
Ooh!

845
01:14:25,947 --> 01:14:27,305
[Lomax]
Get up here.

846
01:14:27,306 --> 01:14:29,385
Come on, Brian,
Come on, Brian, Come on!

847
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:30,905
- Come on, let's go!
- Get up!

848
01:14:31,664 --> 01:14:34,063
[Lomax] Come on, hurry up!
Come on, come on!

849
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:37,023
- Hurry.
- Come on, Brian, come on!

850
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,299
You guys seen
any movies you like?

851
01:14:55,098 --> 01:14:57,138
[digging and scraping]

852
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:04,095
[wet, squirming sound]

853
01:15:12,653 --> 01:15:13,732
All right.

854
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:17,411
A Jewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter.

855
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:21,570
The daughter steps offthe plane
with an eight-foot-tall zulu warrior

856
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:22,970
with a bone through his nose.

857
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:28,209
The mother screams,
"You fool, l said a rich doctor!"

858
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,568
[wet, squirming sound]

859
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:41,764
[male]
Not a dream.

860
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:46,004
We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.

861
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:50,523
We are unable to transmit
through conscious neural interference.

862
01:15:50,524 --> 01:15:53,202
You are receiving
this broadcast asa a dream.

863
01:15:53,923 --> 01:15:57,521
We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9--

864
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,839
[digging and scraping]

865
01:16:19,716 --> 01:16:22,433
We can try the hallway
after it gets dark.

866
01:16:22,434 --> 01:16:24,594
If I can make my way up front,
I could break some windows,

867
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:25,753
call for help.

868
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:29,952
No one out there
can help us.

869
01:16:50,628 --> 01:16:53,946
The other morning you said
that you had something to tell me.

870
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:59,024
[sighs]
Well, you probably...

871
01:17:00,224 --> 01:17:02,143
think that none ofthat
matters now.

872
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:06,062
[sighs]
But you're wrong.

873
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,581
It's the only thing that does.

874
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,899
[groaning]

875
01:17:53,051 --> 01:17:54,849
[moaning]

876
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:13,204
[Birack] Worker ants--
driven to a higher purposae

877
01:18:13,205 --> 01:18:15,164
unknown to the individual.

878
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:21,202
Street people, our colleagues--
all controlled.

879
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:26,321
- Demonic possession?
- Of a kind.

880
01:18:27,882 --> 01:18:31,119
Not what we would expect, though.
Never that.

881
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,999
Why would he need us?

882
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:37,198
The book says,
"His purpose is to bring

883
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,036
the father back
from the dark side."

884
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:41,316
Whereverthat is.

885
01:18:41,477 --> 01:18:44,317
There could be a limit
as to what he can do, you know,

886
01:18:44,318 --> 01:18:46,274
as a volume of liquid.

887
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:50,635
He controls
simple organisms easily.

888
01:18:51,635 --> 01:18:55,912
But maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle.

889
01:18:56,354 --> 01:18:58,152
A hosat in which to live.

890
01:18:59,032 --> 01:19:00,151
[Walter]
Hello?

891
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:02,511
Hello.

892
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:03,911
Walter?

893
01:19:03,912 --> 01:19:06,350
It's Kelly, she's changing again.

894
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,029
The swelling's gone down,

895
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,708
as ifthe liquid was absorbed
into her saystem.

896
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:12,588
l can see tissue
changesa on herface.

897
01:19:13,308 --> 01:19:15,548
Also, I think her bone structure
is changing.

898
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:20,026
Maybe this is the only way
he could actualize his power.

899
01:19:20,986 --> 01:19:24,544
A parasite growing into its host.

900
01:19:24,545 --> 01:19:27,224
This could be some kind
of gestation period.

901
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:29,623
[sighs]
I know I'd seen it before.

902
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:30,903
Kelly had a mark.

903
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:33,063
It was a bruise,
almost like a figure.

904
01:19:33,063 --> 01:19:34,822
I saw it in a history book.

905
01:19:34,823 --> 01:19:38,581
The astrologer's staff used
in ritual magic in the Middle Ages?

906
01:19:38,582 --> 01:19:40,381
-The mark was on her?
- Yes.

907
01:19:41,261 --> 01:19:42,779
As if she were chosen.

908
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,539
Walter!

909
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,978
- What?
- Keep watching her closely.

910
01:19:48,979 --> 01:19:51,257
Anything you see, tell usa!

911
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:53,098
I have to go to the bathroom.

912
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:56,577
God and Father

913
01:19:58,017 --> 01:19:59,415
of our Lord,

914
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,015
Jesus Christ.

915
01:20:03,735 --> 01:20:08,053
I appeal to your holy name...

916
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:12,772
humbly begging that you...

917
01:20:16,452 --> 01:20:18,771
will grant us help...

918
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:23,209
against this...

919
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:28,288
unclean...

920
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:31,847
spirit.

921
01:20:40,805 --> 01:20:41,884
Thou...

922
01:20:44,444 --> 01:20:47,323
tormenting these creatures...

923
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:48,562
ofyours.

924
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:55,320
Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

925
01:21:12,236 --> 01:21:13,155
Hah!

926
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:27,992
Look down..

927
01:21:29,072 --> 01:21:31,831
upon these thy servants,

928
01:21:31,832 --> 01:21:35,069
caught in the coils of--
[sniffs]

929
01:21:49,427 --> 01:21:50,785
[whispering]
Where are you?

930
01:21:55,824 --> 01:21:57,345
Christ.

931
01:22:01,743 --> 01:22:03,462
Where are you?

932
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,739
Holy shit!

933
01:22:18,299 --> 01:22:20,137
[Walter] Get me the hell
out of here!

934
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:22,416
Help me!
Help me get out of here!

935
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,536
They're gonna kill me!
I don't want to die!

936
01:22:24,537 --> 01:22:26,496
Help me!
Help!

937
01:22:27,257 --> 01:22:29,535
- What are you doing?
- Lomax, get behind the door.

938
01:22:29,536 --> 01:22:30,535
You're out ofyour head, Brian!

939
01:22:30,536 --> 01:22:32,374
Get behind the door
when l'm in the hall!

940
01:22:33,775 --> 01:22:36,093
Oh, God, help!

941
01:22:36,094 --> 01:22:37,493
Help me!

942
01:22:39,253 --> 01:22:40,331
Hah!

943
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:04,565
Hey.
[click]

944
01:23:39,077 --> 01:23:40,156
Ahh!

945
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:58,630
[groans]

946
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,658
Come on!

947
01:24:54,817 --> 01:24:56,095
Come on in!

948
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:12,690
[yelling]

949
01:25:27,409 --> 01:25:28,767
It's not working.

950
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,444
[yells]

951
01:25:39,084 --> 01:25:42,843
Father.

952
01:26:04,078 --> 01:26:25,271
[moaning]

953
01:26:27,552 --> 01:26:29,909
[hissing]

954
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:34,429
[Calder moaning]

955
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,819
Father.

956
01:27:14,259 --> 01:27:15,937
[gasps]

957
01:27:32,934 --> 01:27:34,214
Uh!

958
01:27:54,888 --> 01:27:58,686
I could... I could.

959
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:16,682
Unclean spirit...

960
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,319
[speaking Latin]

961
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:38,276
[laughing]

962
01:28:42,714 --> 01:28:59,589
[speaking Latin]

963
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,149
[yelling]

964
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:18,026
Uh!

965
01:29:21,145 --> 01:29:23,942
Father,

966
01:29:25,624 --> 01:29:30,381
come to freedom.

967
01:29:45,697 --> 01:29:47,536
[Calder growling]

968
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:12,290
No!

969
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:16,729
[speaking Latin]

970
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:18,248
No!

971
01:30:23,249 --> 01:30:24,166
[whimpers]

972
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:30,686
[exhales]

973
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:40,403
[soft wind whistling]

974
01:31:10,035 --> 01:31:12,074
[glass breaking]

975
01:31:34,029 --> 01:31:37,268
[chattering]

976
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:49,064
We stopped it.

977
01:31:50,585 --> 01:31:52,502
We stopped it here.

978
01:31:54,623 --> 01:31:56,422
Through the grace of God,

979
01:31:57,942 --> 01:31:59,822
I stopped it.

980
01:32:00,342 --> 01:32:02,460
The future conjured up by that...

981
01:32:04,821 --> 01:32:07,019
that vile serpent...

982
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,338
will not happen now.

983
01:32:15,938 --> 01:32:17,655
[sighs]

984
01:32:24,295 --> 01:32:27,253
[Birack] The samaller parts
could not live

985
01:32:27,254 --> 01:32:29,452
without the strength
ofthe whole.

986
01:32:29,453 --> 01:32:31,413
They had to die.

987
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:35,611
To fade away as the whole was
thrown back and repelled.

988
01:32:38,331 --> 01:32:40,569
We're safe,

989
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,609
but he's waiting
on the other side.

990
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:48,087
She died for us.

991
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:54,527
[man]
This is not a dream.

992
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,886
Not a dream.

993
01:32:56,526 --> 01:32:59,845
We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.

994
01:33:00,725 --> 01:33:04,484
We are unable to transmit
through conscious neural interference.

995
01:33:05,244 --> 01:33:08,642
You are receiving
this broadcast asa a dream.

996
01:33:08,643 --> 01:33:12,921
We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9-9.

997
01:33:13,683 --> 01:33:15,480
You are receiving this broadcasat

998
01:33:15,481 --> 01:33:17,920
in order to alter the events
you are seeing.

999
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:21,479
Our technology has now
developed a transmitter

1000
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,878
satrong enough to reach
your consacious state of awareness.

1001
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,278
But this isa not a dream.

1002
01:33:27,238 --> 01:33:29,917
You are saeeing what is an actual
occurring phenomenon

1003
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:32,396
for purpose of causaality violation.

1004
01:33:38,116 --> 01:33:39,434
[yells]

1005
01:33:39,435 --> 01:33:40,793
Oh!
