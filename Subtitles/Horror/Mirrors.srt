00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,557

with distinct memories

and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

513
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,830
BEN: Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

514
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,431
Daddy, what are you doing?

515
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,395
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

516
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,233
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

517
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,031
AMY: Rosa, what's happening?

518
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,392
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

519
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,955
What the hell are you doing?

520
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,156
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

521
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,470
Get out of the house, right now!

522
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,512
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

523
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,033
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

524
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,997
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

525
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,310
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

526
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,278
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

527
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,554
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

528
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,394
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

529
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,311
What's wrong with you?

530
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,516
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

531
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,036
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

532
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,953
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

533
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,759
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

534
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,435
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

535
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,354
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

536
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,193
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

537
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,078
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

538
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,430
I want to show you something.
