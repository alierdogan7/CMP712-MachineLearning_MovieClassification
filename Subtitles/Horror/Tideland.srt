1
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,200
The rabbit-hole went straight on
like a tunnel for some way...

2
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,440
and then dipped suddenly down.

3
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:50,907
So suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself...

4
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,564
before she found herself falling down...

5
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,000
what seemed to be a very deep well.

6
00:00:56,994 --> 00:01:01,847
Either the well was very deep,
or she fell very slowly...

7
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:07,452
for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her...

8
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:11,025
and to wonder
what was gonna happen next...

9
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,524
You bend so that you don't break

10
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,458
You give but then you can't take

11
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,263
Those wise eyes of yours

12
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:32,874
Those big skies of yours

13
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:36,425
My sweet honey rose

14
00:01:36,589 --> 00:01:39,783
Strange dark flower rose

15
00:01:40,106 --> 00:01:41,251
Jeliza-Rose

16
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,441
One, two, three, four...

17
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,607
No, that...

18
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:59,100
You must be Titania.

19
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,724
Hi, Titania.

20
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:04,916
It's me, Jeliza-Rose.
And this is Mustique.

21
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:08,433
I'm just as excited as anything.

22
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,993
Cos today,
we're all going on a great trip.

23
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,815
Sexual ambush in the new wild west

24
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:28,039
God is a camera, baby,
show us more breast

25
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,948
For every name in a star
on that dirty boulevard

26
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,371
Ten thousand others got shot
through the heart

27
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,722
The Isles of the Dutchman,
it's calling

28
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:42,151
His perfume and money
is the smell of sin

29
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,567
Miss September gave it up
to Robin Hood

30
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:50,240
The day Vincent Van Gogh
came to Hollywood

31
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:53,817
And here's my impression of it all

32
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,671
What's in Denmark?

33
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,393
When you ever been there, anyway?

34
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:25,768
It's just something stupid
you've got in your head. Jutland.

35
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,147
Jutland.

36
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:31,883
Jutland. It's called Jutland.

37
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,537
- It's where we're headed.
- The Viking land of marsh and fjords...

38
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,880
and weird light.

39
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,423
I see dark banks...

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,370
decorated by the most beautiful flies.

41
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,987
Where do you get
all of these crappy ideas, anyway?

42
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,675
Oh, I'm just thinking of a place
without a phone.

43
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,752
Nobody could hound me then.

44
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:58,272
They won't find me,
or you or Jeliza-Rose.

45
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,015
Fuck that, Noah, I ain't going.

46
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,825
- So don't even bother trying. Stupid.
- Whatever you want.

47
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,192
Guess me and Jeliza-Rose
will make the trip. How's that?

48
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:11,951
You know what, Noah...

49
00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:16,437
you and that little shit-critter
can leave whenever you want.

50
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,603
I don't care.

51
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,743
When you're done with daddy
come upstairs and do my legs, okay?

52
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:26,381
Okay, mama.

53
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:27,852
Thanks, sweetheart.

54
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:29,831
Did you know...

55
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,136
that King Harold...

56
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,271
he promised to marry
the Norse Queen, Gunhilda...

57
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,408
and enticed her to Jutland.

58
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:41,349
Then on her arrival she got drowned
in a bog instead.

59
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:45,088
Not very nice, is it?

60
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:48,316
No, not very nice.

61
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:50,436
No. Think she deserved it?

62
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:51,895
No.

63
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,328
I guess she didn't.

64
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,375
Thank you, sweetie.

65
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,932
Yeah...

66
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,298
time for...

67
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,085
for daddy to...

68
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,373
go on a little vacation.

69
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,564
I say poor me.

70
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,295
Danish folk greet the May sunrise.

71
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,396
Daddy...

72
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,172
is Jutland like the Prairies?

73
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:27,752
It's your daddy's fault
you're the way you are, not mine.

74
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,861
Because I loved you.

75
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,259
Lip-smacking little junkie baby.

76
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,197
Irritable and hyperactive, you was.

77
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:39,873
Just twitching and spasms
and convulsions.

78
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:44,515
Your daddy blew smoke in your face
to keep you quiet, you know that?

79
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:49,984
I think it would damage you,
but don't blame me...

80
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:52,823
I breast-fed you forever.

81
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,926
Jeliza-Rose, you know I love you,
don't you?

82
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:01,276
I'm sorry, baby.

83
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:06,006
I'm gonna do something real nice
for you real soon some day, I promise.

84
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,774
- Sure, mama. - Baby...

85
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:16,306
and I want you...
What the fuck are you doing?

86
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:20,328
How many times have I told you to stay
away from my chocolate, you little bitch?

87
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:22,506
Oh, honey.

88
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:31,843
I don't want you to leave me,
Jeliza-Rose.

89
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,407
I can't get by without you, Jeliza-Rose.

90
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,984
Down, down, down.

91
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:44,894
Would the fall never come to an end?

92
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:48,544
"I wonder how many miles I've fallen
by this time?"

93
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:50,718
Alice said aloud.

94
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,130
"I must be getting somewhere near
the centre of the earth."

95
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:11,187
Jeliza-Rose, wake up.

96
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:15,054
Wake up. Listen.
You should know this before I forget.

97
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:16,594
The bog waters...

98
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,953
they have weird powers.
They leave these bodies...

99
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:25,355
in bogs for thousands of years
and they don't decay. They just...

100
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:28,102
Well, they may get a little shrunk
and stuff. Honey, listen to me now.

101
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,406
Come here, try to understand this.
Lookee here.

102
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:32,263
There he is, look, see him...

103
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,300
that man was murdered
two thousand years ago.

104
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,954
You're looking at somebody
deader than dirt.

105
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:40,324
Who killed him?

106
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,657
Well, I don't know.

107
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:48,120
Let's just hope we're in that kind of
shape in two thousand years.

108
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:50,812
Look at him.

109
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,668
He's just...

110
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:54,679
he's just lying there...

111
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,078
waiting to come back to life.

112
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,904
Okay. That's what I wanted to tell you.
Goodnight, baby.

113
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,305
Straight to sleep now,
or else your mum...

114
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:08,148
and all the bog men in the world
will come chasing after you.

115
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:11,536
- Dad! - What?

116
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:12,814
Daddy...

117
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,335
could you leave the light on tonight,
please?

118
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:17,808
Sure, baby. You got it.

119
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,486
It was the methadone that killed her.

120
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,140
Should have kept her on the junk.

121
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:02,162
I should have just cut her dose
and kept her on it.

122
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:03,737
Now she's dead and...

123
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,094
I don't have a car.

124
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,786
Please don't be sad.

125
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,204
Now we can eat all her choc bars.

126
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,815
Look... here they are.

127
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:21,226
No, no one's gonna take you from me,
sweetie.

128
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:24,870
That's not happening here. Huh?
Now, we're leaving.

129
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,586
Okay? We're gonna go off
to the prairies.

130
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:30,634
- Okay?
- We can go to Jutland.

131
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,061
Wouldn't that be wonderful.

132
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,928
All right, is there anything
you wanna say?

133
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:41,150
- Mum's dead all right.
- Maybe we should...

134
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,930
give Queen Gunhilda
a real send-off...

135
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,400
will all the things she loved, yeah.

136
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,126
There'd be horses on there and...

137
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,130
- Yeah. - Some of these.

138
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,296
- Plates of gold. Come on, honey.
- These too.

139
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:01,041
Okay. Yeah, that's it.
What else did she love on there?

140
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,242
- Shoes.
- Oh yeah, she loved shoes, that's it.

141
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:08,534
That's it. Lay her to rest on a...

142
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:10,380
a Viking ship.

143
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:17,005
Yeah... set her on fire.

144
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:22,662
Adrift the great misty fjords at dawn.

145
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,162
No, no, sweetie, sweetie!

146
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:28,236
- Maybe it's a bad idea.
- Come on now.

147
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,460
You might burn up the whole building
and everyone else.

148
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,668
Yeah, you're right.

149
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:36,165
Let's go.

150
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,028
Don't stare, it's bad luck.
Come on.

151
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:52,888
Not it. No, no, come on.
Let's do this damn thing.

152
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,885
Gotta monitor the information
as it develops.

153
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:02,072
The bog men... they'll be looking for me
when they find mum.

154
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,694
Probably already found her.

155
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:12,149
I'm not gonna be safe until we get to
Grandma's house.

156
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,008
Think mum will keep falling
until she falls right through the earth?

157
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:21,542
Got to get rid of the squirrels in the attic
because they're chewing the wiring.

158
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,261
They make a terrible racket
in the morning.

159
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,477
One bit me once.

160
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:30,186
Me and my cousin,
we beat it dead with a bat.

161
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:33,032
But not before that sucker tried
climbing my pant leg...

162
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:36,355
all crazy mad, getting itself
tangled in my hair.

163
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:40,036
Sinking it's big yellow teeth
into my scalp...

164
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,747
tearing at everything.

165
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,718
Nothing. Nothing.

166
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:54,198
Well, Noah isn't even worth
a headline any more.

167
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,279
Yeah, I'm a nobody.

168
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:59,121
Shall I read some more?

169
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,719
Yeah, sweetie,
that would be nice. Read.

170
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,936
"Well!" Thought Alice to herself.

171
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:08,590
Your grandma, she liked the squirrels.

172
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,371
She said the place didn't feel
so lonesome that way.

173
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,505
Jeez.

174
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,159
Oh, mama,
where are you when I need you?

175
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,589
Wish I'd met grandma.

176
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,779
She was a wonderful woman,
your grandma, but...

177
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:46,848
Queen Gunhilda said
"Fuck that. Fuck that." she said.

178
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:47,926
Really!

179
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,852
I wanted to take you, all right.

180
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,801
- We're going there now, right?
- Sure we are.

181
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,201
- I told you. Hey...
- We are, aren't we?

182
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,843
Sweetie, this is just the first stage.
You and me...

183
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:02,452
we're on our travels, honey.
We're going across the ocean to Jutland.

184
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,751
You and me, okay?

185
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:13,420
Jeliza-Rose. Was that you making
those air biscuits? Cutting air muffins?

186
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:14,860
Oh man, that's nasty.

187
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:16,334
It isn't me!

188
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:20,454
You should move to China. Over there,
the louder the burp, the better the meal.

189
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:23,110
A powerful air biscuits delivered with
grace would get you free dessert.

190
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:24,932
That's gross!

191
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:31,522
There you go again. It's a regular
art form with you. Put a plug in it, please.

192
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:33,791
Don't. It's you!

193
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,451
You're doing it. Stop it!

194
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,101
Stop.

195
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,147
Serve you right.

196
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:49,817
For the love of Mike.

197
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:06,005
- Awfully kind of you.
- No problem.

198
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:08,971
Come on, sweetie. Watch it now.

199
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,917
Watch your step.

200
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:20,007
Wow. Is that it?

201
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,598
Yeah.

202
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:29,060
Go on. Go on through.

203
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,800
Place needs a little work.
Wants a new well.

204
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,718
No problem.

205
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:45,176
Look.

206
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,199
Yard needs some tending.

207
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,165
Damn weeds...
they get the better of everything.

208
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:11,504
Nails coming up on the porch.

209
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,089
We can hammer them back down.

210
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,836
Yeah, your grandma,
had this boy mow and weed.

211
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,436
I suppose that fella's all grown-up by now.

212
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:32,131
Hey, ma! I'm home!

213
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:36,381
Home at last! Go on in.

214
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:38,779
Go on. Go on.

215
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,936
Vandals.

216
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,795
Where's my room?

217
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,327
Up with the Gods.

218
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,065
Mustique...

219
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:43,870
Sateen Lips...

220
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,377
Baby Blonde...

221
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,120
and Glitter Gal.

222
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:53,972
Hi, guys.

223
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,346
I'm dying. I can't go on.

224
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,096
I must go on.

225
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:33,825
You will survive.
A complete recovery is expected.

226
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,334
Thank you, thank you, doctor.

227
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:42,390
You've given me hope. I shall live.

228
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:44,598
Oh, doctor.

229
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,263
Doctor.

230
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,594
Now, you don't go short-changing
daddy, will you, sweetheart?

231
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:02,892
I won't.

232
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,955
Don't you worry.

233
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:09,331
Oh, time for daddy's vacation.

234
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,711
Not too long this time, daddy.

235
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,658
Oh no. Just a little vacation.

236
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:19,435
Daddy's going deep sea diving.

237
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,889
Going to the place
where dreams are made.

238
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,575
Thanks, honey.

239
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,776
And daddy...

240
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,651
daddy's gonna stroll down that...

241
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,504
far subterranean shore...

242
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:45,309
all littered with flotsam of
hopes and dreams.

243
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,456
Oh, I see them.

244
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,366
Relics of ancient times...

245
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,482
Ionely cenotaphs...

246
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:25,988
standing along that melancholy tideland.

247
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:28,002
What are you saying?
I don't understand what you're saying.

248
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,453
Come back.

249
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:34,238
You'll get in trouble.
You shouldn't be in there.

250
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,704
People don't like squirrels in the attic.

251
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:42,685
I'm not telling you a secret
because you wouldn't like it.

252
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,598
He's in the room.

253
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,502
Are you ready, Mustique?

254
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,225
I was born ready.

255
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:09,232
Good, because this could get
pretty dangerous.

256
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:13,803
Bring Sateen Lips with us.
She can help.

257
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:18,825
- I don't wanna go.
- Shut up, you baby.

258
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:24,867
Why can't Baby Blonde,
or Glitter Gal do it instead?

259
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:29,982
Keep complaining and me and
Jeliza-Rose will cut off all your hair!

260
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:34,618
Please don't. I'll behave.

261
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:36,896
You better.

262
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,726
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

263
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,901
Maybe he's magic.

264
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:47,381
Maybe he's really a fairy.

265
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:50,391
Don't be silly.

266
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:53,779
Only lightning bugs are like fairies.

267
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:57,590
Squirrel butts don't glow.

268
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,720
He's in the wall.

269
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,133
He's right here.

270
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,062
He's gone through to the next room!

271
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:13,990
Don't go in there. I'm scared.

272
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:17,731
What did I tell you? Safe as houses.

273
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,425
I'm still scared.

274
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,316
That squirrel can't hide from me!

275
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:42,042
We're going in... right, Jeliza-Rose?

276
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:43,963
Right.

277
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:56,150
But I'm still scared, Jeliza-Rose.

278
00:25:57,271 --> 00:26:01,491
If we're not back in an hour,
then come after us...

279
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,218
because it means...

280
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,089
we're being pulverized.

281
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,064
It's like a cave.

282
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:21,705
It's grandma's stuff!
Yeah... that's what it is.

283
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:25,056
Let's taka a look at those boxes.

284
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:27,486
No.

285
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,471
Scared!

286
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,352
What's so spooky about boxes?

287
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,352
It's the treasure chest that's spooky.

288
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,405
Bet there's slippers...

289
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:43,321
and gold in it.

290
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:48,538
Or a dead thing.

291
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:06,312
It's just old clothes.

292
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:09,322
See.

293
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,358
I bet she was beautiful.

294
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,817
- She was old!
- She was my grandma!

295
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:50,101
She was old and ugly
with boxes of squirrel-chewed junk!

296
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:54,289
You're lying. Shut up or we're leaving.

297
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,284
That's what happened.

298
00:28:12,014 --> 00:28:14,085
We've turned into squirrels.

299
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,906
There's Jeliza-Rose.

300
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,979
She's looking for us.

301
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:45,750
Boom boom boom boom
I'm gonna shoot you right down

302
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:46,840
Daddy?

303
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,775
Right offa your feet

304
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:53,709
Take you home with me

305
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,468
I had a bad dream.

306
00:28:57,493 --> 00:28:59,281
Boom boom boom boom

307
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,086
I love to see you strut

308
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:13,674
Still on vacation, daddy?

309
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,356
When you talking to me

310
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,944
That baby talk

311
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:22,717
I like it like that

312
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:25,891
Whoa, yeah!

313
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:28,250
Talk that talk

314
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,398
Walk that walk

315
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:54,675
Morning.

316
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:16,004
I'm hungry.

317
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,795
This is Radio Jeliza-Rose.

318
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:28,991
Are you receiving me?
Over.

319
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:34,742
This is Radio Jeliza-Rose.

320
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:38,291
Am I coming in loud and clear?
Over.

321
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:57,171
Won't talk to you too.

322
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,786
It's not nice, you know.

323
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:02,252
You wouldn't like it too.

324
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,366
Get off!

325
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:12,998
Die, die, die!

326
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:18,846
It's clear. All clear.

327
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,478
Now... we mustn't sing or talk...

328
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:28,860
or we'll spook the fairies...
and they won't come.

329
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:30,879
I have to see them.

330
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:37,406
Probably they won't be out
till tonight anyway.

331
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:54,797
Lift me up sweet Jesus

332
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,344
Nail me by his crooked cross

333
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:02,952
Oh what a glorious day

334
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:04,394
A ghost.

335
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:07,971
She was killed in this very bus.

336
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:10,795
All burned bad.

337
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,572
That's why her face is covered up.

338
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,489
Maybe she's a queen...
and she got strangled.

339
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:24,740
She's Queen Gunhilda.
She didn't want to stay dead any more.

340
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:31,103
We have to go home.
We have to go tell daddy. Right now!

341
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:37,625
We saw a ghost!

342
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:51,633
We saw a ghost.

343
00:32:55,508 --> 00:32:57,646
She was looking for something.

344
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:11,361
Get on with it, you little bitch.

345
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,536
I'm dying.

346
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:28,448
My tongue is filling my head.

347
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,319
I'm really dying this time.

348
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,184
This is not a vacation.

349
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:42,739
Dear, you're already dead.
You're a ghost. A spook.

350
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,878
So beautiful too.

351
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,594
I'm a vision.

352
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:53,931
Dear...

353
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:59,148
promise me something, Jeliza-Rose.

354
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:07,244
If I ever end up looking like Glitter Gal...

355
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,640
promise you'll just kill me.

356
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,974
I couldn't.

357
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:14,658
I could never.

358
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,580
Oh, yes you could.

359
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:27,544
You're a vision.

360
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:30,201
You're a sensation.

361
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,148
We're very proud of you.

362
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,184
You're our beauty queen...

363
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:44,562
and it's only right you look your best
for the seance.

364
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:54,383
Now... hold hands.

365
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,858
Mustique, you too.

366
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,766
Ridiculous.

367
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:05,195
Everyone close your eyes.

368
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:10,663
The ghost is sending us a message.

369
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,182
A psychic message.

370
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:18,214
She wants something.

371
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,020
Like what?

372
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:24,001
A gift.

373
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:27,899
I could draw a picture, of you and me.

374
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,268
Or give her Glitter Gal.

375
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:32,121
Shut up, Mustique.

376
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,748
Then what?

377
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:38,616
Something only a dead person uses.

378
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,146
The radio. It's dead.

379
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:44,087
The dead can listen to ghost voices.

380
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:46,932
And ghost music too.

381
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:49,650
Except...

382
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:55,435
daddy likes listening to music.

383
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:59,658
First, we make an altar.

384
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:06,817
Jeliza-Rose, this is not going to work.

385
00:36:07,053 --> 00:36:08,710
Shut up, Mustique.

386
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,821
Bog men are stirring.

387
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:21,435
Let's go. Ghosts and monsters
are fast runners, remember?

388
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:24,701
No, they aren't. Dead things are slow.

389
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:27,035
You have to be alive to run.

390
00:36:29,473 --> 00:36:33,627
They get you...
when you're not expecting them.

391
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,378
What are you doing?

392
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,395
What have you been messing with here?

393
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:45,237
- Are you mute, vandal?
- I'm scared.

394
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,336
Ooh, vandal's scared.

395
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,159
I'm not a vandal.

396
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:53,299
I'm Jeliza-Rose.

397
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,017
Jeliza-Rose.

398
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,263
Well...

399
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,672
a vandal by any other name.
You understand?

400
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,890
Children. This is for me?

401
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:09,733
It's a gift.

402
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:14,529
Something useful.

403
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:20,956
Any bees?

404
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:24,699
Go mess elsewhere.

405
00:37:26,114 --> 00:37:28,414
One sting and I'm paralyzed...
most likely dead.

406
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:29,883
But you are dead.

407
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:35,098
What a thing to say!
What kind of a child are you?

408
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,659
- What I meant to say was...
- Well, you should say what you mean!

409
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:38,996
- I do. - No, you don't!

410
00:37:39,227 --> 00:37:40,982
Meaning what you say
is something quite different.

411
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,159
You might just as well have said...

412
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,490
"I see what I eat" is the same as
"I eat what I see". Which it isn't.

413
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:48,689
If you see a bee or you hear a bee,
you'll say so, right?

414
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:52,083
If I'm stung and die, it'll be your fault.

415
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:00,837
Stung in my own garden.

416
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,370
Blinded by a bee.

417
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:07,490
Revenge for destroying
my daddy's hives, I say.

418
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:09,511
Poured gas on them.

419
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:11,206
Set them ablaze.

420
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:17,506
See my daddy, he loved his bees,
and they loved him, I'm sure.

421
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:21,857
They is jealous creatures, though.
Hated my mama.

422
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:23,676
Pure evil.

423
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,656
My mama's heart...

424
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,515
just stopped.

425
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:36,859
And we never ate apple pie again.
She was changed forever.

426
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:41,007
Now... there isn't a bee alive
that doesn't want me murdered.

427
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,321
And this...

428
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:45,805
this is revenge!

429
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,240
A dead peeper.

430
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,898
Dreadful, isn't it?

431
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:57,631
Who's this?

432
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,202
- This for me too?
- It's Mustique.

433
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,162
She's my friend.

434
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:09,210
Well, you should consider the company
you keep, I think. You take it.

435
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:12,919
You be going now.

436
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:20,273
You're not a real ghost, anyhow.

437
00:39:22,515 --> 00:39:23,823
Not yet.

438
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:38,755
Maybe we'll meet again.

439
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,684
I'll most probably come by here
tomorrow... around noon.

440
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:48,385
Well, you can leave your friend behind,
she's trouble.

441
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:53,721
Okay.

442
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:58,074
Children!

443
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,336
She doesn't hate me. She doesn't!

444
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,282
Daddy! She doesn't hate me!

445
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,161
She's not a ghost at all.

446
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:11,030
Daddy, I think
she could be my new friend.

447
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:13,557
She invited me to a picnic.

448
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:17,524
The only thing is...

449
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,848
she just wants me to go.

450
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:27,439
She doesn't like Mustique...

451
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:30,281
and I don't think she'd like the others.

452
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:41,092
I'm going on my own.

453
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,297
Sleep... dear little ones, sleep.

454
00:40:51,107 --> 00:40:52,448
You dream...

455
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:56,726
of trains... of Eskimo pies...

456
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,878
and old men dancing with bears.

457
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,055
Lift me up sweet Jesus

458
00:41:57,312 --> 00:42:00,921
Lay me on His crooked cross

459
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:06,103
Oh what a glorious day

460
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:11,630
Have me down on my knees and pray

461
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:16,846
Lift me up sweet Jesus

462
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:20,687
Lay me on His crooked cross

463
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:46,464
Kill a rabbit yourself, Dickens.

464
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,447
I'm too busy today.

465
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:52,732
Now, do you think you're the only person
with things to do?

466
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:54,073
No, Dell, I can't!

467
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,092
Lord, I don't know why
I is getting such cross.

468
00:42:56,192 --> 00:42:58,874
I can't kill rabbits, Dell.

469
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:02,231
Because they've got big eyes.
And they're watching me.

470
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:05,656
- Why can't you kill them?
- Because I can't.

471
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:08,248
You know I can't. You hear me?

472
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:12,561
If you do that to rabbits I feel bad.
I don't do that.

473
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:17,263
Well, I put food in my tummy already.
Am I a maid? Am I a wife?

474
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,288
Do I make the sky turn blue?
Dickens, feed yourself, you're no child.

475
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:24,008
But my tummy is empty, Dell!

476
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,826
You didn't even leave me a crumb.

477
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:33,061
You tummy will get his food, Dickens,
but not for lunch. No lunch.

478
00:43:33,324 --> 00:43:35,363
I'll fill him at dinner,
he'll get his rabbit then.

479
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:38,279
Mama needs reading to
before I kill for you.

480
00:43:39,624 --> 00:43:40,485
Boy!

481
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,871
She's gonna kill you, rabbit.

482
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:10,551
Better hide. Gonna eat you for dinner.

483
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:15,881
Better hide. Gonna eat you for dinner.

484
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,072
It was such a wonderful time.

485
00:44:21,298 --> 00:44:25,736
They invited me into
their little stone house. They really did.

486
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:30,857
And we danced and played games
and sang songs.

487
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:34,787
Her name is Dell.

488
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:37,384
And she had the radio fixed.

489
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:42,244
And I danced with Dickens.
It was wonderful, Mustique.

490
00:44:42,886 --> 00:44:45,983
Well, I wouldn't know, would I?

491
00:44:47,044 --> 00:44:48,952
I wasn't there.

492
00:44:52,832 --> 00:44:54,620
I know, Mustique.

493
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,437
I'm sorry you couldn't come too.

494
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:06,323
I wanted you to.

495
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:10,446
- I really did.
- You hypnotized us!

496
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:12,267
I had to.

497
00:45:13,813 --> 00:45:15,722
So you wouldn't stop me going.

498
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:22,349
There...

499
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:27,208
What is that stink?

500
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,231
What died in here?

501
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:34,792
You quit cutting muffins!

502
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:39,104
Poo in the yard,
because that's where you do it!

503
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:47,896
What are you eating?

504
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:49,783
You're fat.

505
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,899
Your belly is poking.

506
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:07,661
You're a real stinker.

507
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:11,437
And don't say it's me, because it's you.

508
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,043
And you know it!

509
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,807
You don't have to eat
if you don't want to, daddy.

510
00:46:30,508 --> 00:46:33,092
Maybe I'll bring back some food
from Dell.

511
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:35,871
A butter tart...

512
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,367
or maybe a little piece of her chicken.

513
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:43,300
Go away, bog man. Leave me alone!

514
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:46,202
Go away, bog man!

515
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,574
No, no, don't be mad.
I'm wrong again. I'm sorry.

516
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:56,061
The old lady isn't here any more.
I know that. I'm going now.

517
00:46:56,638 --> 00:46:57,848
She isn't here any more.

518
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:00,922
Wait! Dickens!

519
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,993
Dickens! Don't be scared.

520
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:08,273
Dell is my friend. We ate a picnic too!

521
00:47:08,887 --> 00:47:12,911
Come back! I'm Dell's best friend!

522
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:17,009
Dickens?

523
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:24,460
Come out.

524
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:32,260
I can see you.

525
00:47:32,747 --> 00:47:36,738
If I run too fast... I faint like a girl.

526
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:40,066
I'm a girl. I don't faint like a girl.

527
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:48,410
I'm Jeliza-Rose.

528
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:53,396
My daddy wrote a song about me
because I'm special.

529
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:10,132
How come you know my name?

530
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:14,097
Dell told me. She's my best friend.

531
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:17,741
She's my sister.

532
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:22,597
Who was that in the chair?

533
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:24,650
Was that your mama?

534
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:27,170
My daddy.

535
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:34,471
He's pretty too... with pretty hair.

536
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:36,902
I made him pretty.

537
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,568
The old lady lived there.

538
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:46,519
See, the door was open,
so, she could have been there too.

539
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,663
But she wasn't, but maybe she was.

540
00:48:51,072 --> 00:48:54,332
Yeah,
I'm always getting into trouble that way...

541
00:48:55,645 --> 00:48:56,986
when I'm wrong.

542
00:48:58,748 --> 00:48:59,730
Wait.

543
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,453
What happened to your head?

544
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:08,076
They cut inside my head, they did.
They cut my brain...

545
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:13,513
so I'm not epileptic no more
only sometimes.

546
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:14,958
Like this.

547
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:28,391
Do you have a pool?

548
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:33,986
No. I can't swim. Because I'll get
a seizure and sink like a stone.

549
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:36,774
I don't swim except in the tub.

550
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:40,259
- And I don't drive cars.
- Yeah, me either.

551
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:43,394
See, I can't drive to save my life.
Not even if I'm bloody...

552
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:45,594
or my arm's chopped off.

553
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,475
If you drive you'll go...

554
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,660
Yeah, yeah, that's what'll happen,
all right.

555
00:49:55,772 --> 00:49:59,927
Uh-oh. Careful, you'll drown
if you don't keep swimming?

556
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,616
Oh, I'm drowning!

557
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:06,613
I am. Save me! Save me!

558
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,911
I need to go get Lisa.

559
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:11,180
- Lisa? - Yeah, Lisa!

560
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,429
And see, then I don't have to swim
anyway. Lisa's my submarine.

561
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:21,262
If you wanna see it, I don't know...

562
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:23,722
Maybe tomorrow you can.

563
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:27,940
I want to see it. I like submarines.

564
00:50:29,323 --> 00:50:30,729
Thing is...

565
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,588
thing is, you gotta hold my hand, okay?

566
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:37,797
Real tight, okay?

567
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:40,159
Okay.

568
00:50:41,284 --> 00:50:44,959
Because that way we don't get lost
from each other.

569
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:48,730
- All right. - Okay.

570
00:50:49,408 --> 00:50:50,454
That way...

571
00:50:55,964 --> 00:50:57,556
it's the ocean!

572
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:05,011
This it!

573
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:09,329
She's Lisa!

574
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:13,868
She's Lisa.

575
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,028
Vessels underwater have girl names.

576
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:26,659
Boats on top do too. Well, some do.

577
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:32,255
What's this supposed to be?
A periscope?

578
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,664
Yeah.

579
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,482
Dive! Dive!

580
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,668
What's this junk?

581
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:48,252
It ain't junk, it's bait!

582
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:51,607
You see this?

583
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:54,968
Shark attack!

584
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:59,124
- A shark did this?
- A monster shark.

585
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:04,588
Because I hunt them all over
the South Pacific in my submarine.

586
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,610
And I set bait.

587
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:15,531
They're mostly pennies,
but I got a million.

588
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:22,121
I set the bait like this.

589
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:25,986
And then the monster shark,
he comes down the tracks...

590
00:52:26,251 --> 00:52:28,617
his jaws are gnashing...

591
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:32,285
he mashes everything in his way,
that shark.

592
00:52:33,256 --> 00:52:38,109
When I find bigger bait,
I hide in the submarine and wait.

593
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:41,601
The only way to stop that monster
is to blow him up.

594
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:44,825
Rocks and spears don't work,
believe me.

595
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,675
I'm lucky I'm alive.

596
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:57,136
I need to be home. I need to be home.

597
00:52:58,266 --> 00:52:59,989
- Dickens. - You too.

598
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:04,397
- Don't get in my submarine without me.
- I won't.

599
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:06,156
Bye.

600
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,982
Bye, friend.

601
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:10,258
Don't drown.

602
00:53:12,243 --> 00:53:13,965
Come visit me tomorrow.

603
00:53:53,532 --> 00:53:58,232
We'll sail away... under the seas.

604
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,144
Dive. Dive.

605
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:09,042
Dive. Dive.

606
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:37,610
You love, Dickens?

607
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:39,185
No I don't.

608
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:43,239
You want to kiss the cut on his head
and hold hands.

609
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,838
But, he's a sissy.

610
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:49,258
He's a shark hunter.
He has a submarine too.

611
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,209
Except it's a fake.

612
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:54,218
He's gonna be rich and buy a real one.

613
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:57,224
He has more pennies than you.

614
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:01,669
Hey, wait for me.
That monster shark might be about.

615
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:05,603
Don't worry.
Dickens the sea captain will save us.

616
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,863
He's sailing under the seas now.

617
00:55:09,315 --> 00:55:12,925
He's diving deep to the place
where dreams are made.

618
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:17,974
"He walks a lonely shore all littered
with dreams and hopes..."

619
00:55:18,846 --> 00:55:22,422
Dickens, my brave sea captain.

620
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:36,499
Avast ye, you scurvy...

621
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,950
I'll have you keelhauled.

622
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:44,486
I'll have you strung to the yard arm
and sent to Davey Jones's locker!

623
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,108
- Have mercy on my soul!
- Mutiny.

624
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,715
Looks like the pirate took
the captain prisoner.

625
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:57,441
- Mercy.
- Those who die will be the lucky ones!

626
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:03,523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

627
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:07,227
Wait a minute,
he looks more like a farmer.

628
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,013
He's not really a captain...

629
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:15,029
- or a prisoner or anything.
- Go on in, Dickens.

630
00:56:15,232 --> 00:56:19,485
- Stay in your room till I call you out.
- Okay, Dell, okay.

631
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,498
Afternoon, Miss Munro.

632
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,575
Hello, Patrick.

633
00:56:27,225 --> 00:56:31,957
Is it afternoon?
My, how the day flies, you know.

634
00:56:32,662 --> 00:56:35,082
"My, how the day flies you know."

635
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:40,620
I do appreciate all you do for me,
Patrick.

636
00:56:41,521 --> 00:56:44,651
You are such a kind young man.

637
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:49,385
- Well, I always try...
- I know.

638
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:51,972
I know. Now, Patrick...

639
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:56,615
these deliveries...
they is all paid for, ain't they?

640
00:56:57,545 --> 00:56:58,722
Sure.

641
00:57:00,327 --> 00:57:01,853
Thank you.

642
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:05,626
Are you...

643
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:07,549
are you go...

644
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:09,594
will you...

645
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,412
I will.

646
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:16,695
I will... but not here.

647
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:19,351
Not in the yard...

648
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:21,752
not by the tomatoes.

649
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,043
It's a zoo room.

650
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:10,487
It stinks of disinfectant.

651
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:24,528
Miss Munro.

652
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:29,329
What are they doing?

653
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:32,332
She's touching his boy-thing.

654
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:36,109
It's gone all angry and red!

655
00:58:36,403 --> 00:58:38,541
She's kissing it!

656
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,336
She's sucking his blood!

657
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:55,237
- He's trying to call for help.
- She's a vampire.

658
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,017
You're next.

659
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:03,740
Oh, shit. Why'd you stop, Miss Mun...

660
00:59:19,004 --> 00:59:22,133
We're safe. We escaped.

661
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:26,770
I thought she was gonna be my friend.

662
00:59:28,758 --> 00:59:33,131
Say... isn't that the rabbit hole you found?

663
00:59:35,411 --> 00:59:37,581
It looks bigger than before.

664
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:41,125
Maybe I could crawl in.

665
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:44,589
I want to look in. Show me.

666
00:59:46,414 --> 00:59:48,322
Okay. All right.

667
00:59:55,816 --> 00:59:57,603
Mustique!

668
00:59:57,831 --> 01:00:00,645
I'm falling very slowly, dear.

669
01:00:00,902 --> 01:00:05,721
The sides of the holes are filled
with cupboards and book-shelves.

670
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:07,803
Can you hear me?

671
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:11,418
No, don't listen to her!

672
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:14,393
She's gone, Jeliza-Rose.

673
01:00:14,622 --> 01:00:20,848
It's too dangerous to rescue Mustique.
You have to face up to it.

674
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,430
Take that! She's not dead yet.

675
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:27,470
You just wanna take her place.

676
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:30,229
You're all traitors.

677
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:34,962
You don't have hearts.
You're just heads!

678
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:38,826
- And you too!
- No, no.

679
01:00:39,025 --> 01:00:43,179
Jeliza-Rose, please.
I want to help save Mustique.

680
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:48,226
I truly do. Because of my eyes,
I can sense things in the dark.

681
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:51,459
You're better than those other two.

682
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:55,876
I'm sorry Mustique was so mean to you.

683
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:04,345
I'm almost a ghost.

684
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:08,125
That's why Dell didn't see me.

685
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,734
I really think I am...

686
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:13,308
don't you?

687
01:01:13,502 --> 01:01:18,039
I really can't say, Jeliza-Rose.
I don't know about those things.

688
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,645
Come in, Mustique.

689
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:28,752
Are you there?

690
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:31,152
Can you hear me?

691
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,353
This is radio Jeliza-Rose.

692
01:01:35,602 --> 01:01:38,731
Am I loud and clear?
Come in, please.

693
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,261
Over.

694
01:02:06,754 --> 01:02:08,127
Dickens?

695
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:10,618
Thought you was a squirrel.

696
01:02:10,975 --> 01:02:12,283
He's spoiled.

697
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:16,536
He's cutting muffins, is all.

698
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:23,317
I guess that's what it is... I guess.
Whatever it is.

699
01:02:23,736 --> 01:02:26,123
Your daddy sleeps a lot.

700
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:29,961
- My mama does too.
- Is she a ghost?

701
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:33,774
No, not any more. Not really.

702
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:35,692
She's just a dozer.

703
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,022
She isn't as pretty as your daddy.

704
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:42,342
Her hair isn't nice like his is.

705
01:02:42,894 --> 01:02:44,780
It's only fake.

706
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:45,900
See.

707
01:02:49,354 --> 01:02:52,735
That's funny.
You fooled me because I didn't know.

708
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:55,039
It's not supposed to be funny.

709
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:59,037
It was Mustique's idea.

710
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:03,775
Dickens... will you help me
save my friend?

711
01:03:03,938 --> 01:03:08,605
She may be dying.
She's farther than the ocean, I think.

712
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:15,355
I probably can't do it.

713
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,812
But you're the captain!

714
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:22,448
Yeah, I am.
Because I've got my own submarine.

715
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:26,834
Can we feed the shark?
I'd like to do that.

716
01:03:27,446 --> 01:03:32,080
If you want you can help me too.
We can lure it.

717
01:03:32,402 --> 01:03:34,224
Meaner than death.

718
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,783
Okay, I'll help you.

719
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:40,167
Then you'll rescue my friend?

720
01:03:41,678 --> 01:03:42,539
Yeah.

721
01:03:44,717 --> 01:03:46,145
What'll happen?

722
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:51,396
The end of the world.

723
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,014
The monster shark will die?

724
01:03:55,942 --> 01:03:58,396
The monster shark never dies.

725
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:10,041
Bad dog.

726
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,563
You watered all the fish and seaweeds.

727
01:04:14,236 --> 01:04:16,177
Bad dog!

728
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:19,573
- You're the bad dog.
- No, you're the bad dog.

729
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:24,371
- You're a bad dog!
- You're a bad dog for looking.

730
01:04:25,206 --> 01:04:27,028
We better go.

731
01:04:27,286 --> 01:04:30,186
If the monster shark catches us here,
we're doomed.

732
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:32,618
Monster shark!

733
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:37,417
Monster shark. Gonna kill you.
It's gonna eat you.

734
01:04:38,096 --> 01:04:39,982
The bus! We can hide there.

735
01:04:40,558 --> 01:04:44,201
No, that's a bad place.
It's wrong there.

736
01:04:44,428 --> 01:04:46,314
No. Come on!

737
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:48,959
Can't go there.

738
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:54,620
You use the bus for shark bait
and it tips over and burns up.

739
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:57,345
And then you get in trouble.

740
01:04:57,509 --> 01:05:01,467
And Officer Waller said "You can't
drive a bus on the tracks, Dickens...

741
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:06,203
you should know that.
That'll get you sent away, Dickens."

742
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,788
So I can't go there with you.

743
01:05:10,046 --> 01:05:12,118
I can't go there with you.

744
01:05:12,989 --> 01:05:15,704
Captain, you're acting wei...

745
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:17,327
- silly - Can't go.

746
01:05:18,074 --> 01:05:21,749
Sometimes you just worry about it
too much.

747
01:05:22,455 --> 01:05:26,098
Just pretend it never happened, okay?

748
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,898
I better go home now and eat, I think.

749
01:05:31,026 --> 01:05:33,480
Maybe we can find some food together.

750
01:05:34,257 --> 01:05:37,037
We shouldn't play no more today.

751
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:42,248
You have to save my friend.
You said you'd do that.

752
01:05:42,508 --> 01:05:47,688
I don't know, because I make mistakes
if I try some things.

753
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:50,400
But you have to.

754
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:54,309
You promised.

755
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,440
What is your friend?

756
01:05:57,637 --> 01:05:58,651
A head.

757
01:05:59,267 --> 01:06:01,983
- A doll's head.
- Does she bite?

758
01:06:02,178 --> 01:06:03,225
No.

759
01:06:03,937 --> 01:06:06,075
Her mouth is like this.

760
01:06:10,046 --> 01:06:11,900
She doesn't have teeth.

761
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:15,222
All right. Okay.

762
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:27,851
Wait! I got her. It has to be her.

763
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:31,017
- It has to be.
- Yeah, it has to be!

764
01:06:36,527 --> 01:06:38,315
No, it's weird.

765
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:43,365
It's not a head at all,
it's not like what you said.

766
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:46,687
And that's all that's down there, okay?

767
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,790
There's nothing but dirt and more dirt.

768
01:06:50,184 --> 01:06:51,645
She's dead.

769
01:06:56,996 --> 01:06:59,515
I can feel something coming.

770
01:07:00,834 --> 01:07:04,956
It's the monster shark!
He's coming for the bait!

771
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:09,944
- Look out!
- Wait! Where are you going?

772
01:07:11,996 --> 01:07:14,199
Dickens! Dickens!

773
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,279
Dickens!

774
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:19,409
Damn you. Trouble-maker!

775
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,646
Vandal!

776
01:07:34,608 --> 01:07:38,283
Hold on, Jeliza-Rose. We're coming.

777
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,589
Come on, hurry up.

778
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,243
Is she dead?

779
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,104
I can't be sure.

780
01:07:47,433 --> 01:07:50,246
Look, she's breathing.

781
01:07:51,175 --> 01:07:56,736
She's weak. And must be pretty hungry,
pretty thirsty too.

782
01:07:57,283 --> 01:07:59,453
What's that?

783
01:08:01,154 --> 01:08:03,771
Smells like disinfectant.

784
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,406
- Look, I try to be good, okay.
- Dickens...

785
01:08:08,701 --> 01:08:11,798
And I'll get the boy.

786
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:15,990
Where are you going, Jeliza-Rose?

787
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:19,729
Don't go downstairs. Dell's there.

788
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:22,228
Don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

789
01:08:22,742 --> 01:08:25,871
I wish Mustique were here.

790
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,001
Don't cry. Mustique's gone forever.

791
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:32,582
Don't go downstairs. I'm afraid.

792
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:36,108
- You're always crying.
- Baby.

793
01:08:36,782 --> 01:08:38,920
- I'm not a baby.
- You act like one.

794
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:40,649
Cry baby.

795
01:08:40,876 --> 01:08:46,023
Cry, cry baby, cry baby.

796
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:49,830
Maybe you two want to come with me?

797
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:53,348
Well, you're coming anyhow.

798
01:08:54,692 --> 01:08:57,757
Please don't go, Jeliza-Rose.

799
01:08:58,626 --> 01:09:01,559
What is that terrible smell?

800
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:03,701
I told you...

801
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:06,078
disinfectant.

802
01:09:09,373 --> 01:09:12,273
What can she be doing down there?

803
01:09:13,786 --> 01:09:15,160
I don't know.

804
01:09:16,697 --> 01:09:17,973
We'll find out.

805
01:09:33,008 --> 01:09:35,724
To meet again like this...

806
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:39,850
I won't let you go though. Not again.

807
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,640
No more running away.

808
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,780
I love you so much.

809
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,223
There's so much damage done already.

810
01:10:00,385 --> 01:10:02,751
But I'll save what's left. Oh, I will.

811
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:04,595
Put this there.

812
01:10:07,294 --> 01:10:10,641
- Who welcomed you down here, child?
- Not me, Dell, I didn't!

813
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,552
Not me.

814
01:10:15,737 --> 01:10:17,940
Wigs and blush, they won't cut it, child.

815
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:21,133
You can stay and watch if you must,
but you be quiet or else.

816
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:27,979
Now I want to chill him.

817
01:10:28,786 --> 01:10:30,475
What a mess.

818
01:10:34,511 --> 01:10:37,444
This isn't fun. This is a sad man.

819
01:10:37,645 --> 01:10:40,065
This a sad, sad man.

820
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:41,567
Now...

821
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,446
Sinister apples.

822
01:10:49,702 --> 01:10:52,287
Sinister, sinister apples.

823
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:56,737
I'm tired, I'm tired, tired, tired.

824
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,449
See the skin has to be peeled.

825
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:01,175
And then the fat trimmed...

826
01:11:01,376 --> 01:11:04,604
and the bones, they get sprinkled
with powdered Borax...

827
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,862
then the shaping of the wire begins...

828
01:11:08,124 --> 01:11:10,938
and the mending,
the sewing, the varnishing...

829
01:11:17,623 --> 01:11:18,637
Rose.

830
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,073
Rose.

831
01:11:23,093 --> 01:11:24,848
Arise, Rose...

832
01:11:25,395 --> 01:11:27,249
and behold Noah.

833
01:11:29,553 --> 01:11:33,512
- Is he all better now?
- Course he's better, course he is.

834
01:11:34,926 --> 01:11:36,615
Are you gonna give him something?

835
01:11:37,516 --> 01:11:39,784
A gift for his new life.

836
01:11:40,811 --> 01:11:42,850
- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know.

837
01:11:43,082 --> 01:11:46,342
You have to choose. It has to be
something dear to you, though.

838
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:54,080
- No, not me!
- No, not me.

839
01:11:54,308 --> 01:11:57,208
- No, don't. Oh, please. Please!
- Don't, Jeliza-Rose... I'm scared.

840
01:11:57,505 --> 01:12:02,292
Not me! Jeliza-Rose, I'm your friend.

841
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,932
Jeliza-Rose!

842
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,499
- Goodbye. - No.

843
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,046
Have a nice trip.

844
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:13,712
Jeliza-Rose, get me out.

845
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:19,504
- We're so afraid!
- Somebody save me. Help!

846
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,572
Can anyone hear me? Help!

847
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:26,832
You brought Noah back to me.

848
01:12:28,305 --> 01:12:30,376
So we'll share him now.

849
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:35,012
But you're his.

850
01:12:36,045 --> 01:12:37,604
You understand, child?

851
01:12:48,358 --> 01:12:50,909
Go to the porch, draw in,
it's the fumes.

852
01:12:51,877 --> 01:12:53,730
It's unhealthy for your lungs.

853
01:12:54,658 --> 01:12:55,967
Go on, get!

854
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:17,841
It's a new day.

855
01:13:19,893 --> 01:13:21,551
We'll get your house in order.

856
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,080
An untidy home means an untidy person.

857
01:13:26,897 --> 01:13:29,285
Monster! You nasty thing!

858
01:13:32,078 --> 01:13:33,255
Nasty thing.

859
01:13:35,021 --> 01:13:37,867
Come on, things to do.
Come on. Up. Up!

860
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:41,097
Dickens.

861
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:45,729
- Gotta clean, clean, clean.
- Clean, clean, clean.

862
01:13:49,157 --> 01:13:51,163
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

863
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:54,841
And clean the tarnished soul

864
01:13:55,842 --> 01:13:59,102
He will heal me
Make me whole

865
01:13:59,328 --> 01:14:00,276
Wipe it!

866
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:05,527
Rise and shine

867
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:09,333
Rise and shine

868
01:14:09,562 --> 01:14:14,578
We'll rise and shine with Jesus
In my new home in the sky

869
01:14:14,775 --> 01:14:17,360
With loaves and fish He'll feed us

870
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,955
His pierced hands will lead us

871
01:14:20,212 --> 01:14:25,392
And we'll rise and shine with Jesus
in the sky

872
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:28,038
Now when we get to heaven

873
01:14:28,304 --> 01:14:30,856
That sin'll be all compared

874
01:14:31,055 --> 01:14:35,908
And angel's wings we're given
as we climb them golden stairs

875
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:39,368
I'm gonna strip off
and put on a pure white robe

876
01:14:39,594 --> 01:14:41,765
Scrub clean my sinful soul

877
01:14:41,961 --> 01:14:44,513
So wash me in the blood

878
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:50,849
Wash me in the blood of Jesus

879
01:14:52,323 --> 01:14:53,304
Now...

880
01:14:54,946 --> 01:14:57,879
seal your eyes and mouth,
extend your arms and hold your breath.

881
01:15:01,278 --> 01:15:03,219
Do your panties.

882
01:15:05,372 --> 01:15:09,047
Beer braised rabbit with carrots
and onions and potatoes.

883
01:15:09,306 --> 01:15:12,403
A jar of lemonade and butter tarts
for dessert.

884
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:16,179
Fruits of Eden all for the children of Noah.

885
01:15:20,084 --> 01:15:21,513
Jeliza-Rose...

886
01:15:21,715 --> 01:15:23,241
this is where you belong...

887
01:15:24,114 --> 01:15:27,429
Jeliza... this is where you belong.
You're part...

888
01:15:28,144 --> 01:15:31,044
you're part of the family now,
you hear me?

889
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,698
We cannot have any strangers here.

890
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:36,323
They'd take daddy away from us.
Do you hear me?

891
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:42,151
Dear Lord...

892
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:47,460
I hold up a hand to Death.
I keep that troublesome stranger away.

893
01:15:47,781 --> 01:15:49,471
- That is my calling. - Hallelujah.

894
01:15:49,668 --> 01:15:52,896
When you love something,
it doesn't have to die or go in the ground.

895
01:15:53,122 --> 01:15:57,756
Nothing has to change, for I am
the keeper of the silent souls. Amen.

896
01:15:57,983 --> 01:15:59,357
Amen.

897
01:15:59,902 --> 01:16:03,283
Now, eat. Stuff yourselves.

898
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:04,660
Yeah.

899
01:16:09,305 --> 01:16:10,482
He's good.

900
01:16:11,896 --> 01:16:13,903
I waited for you for so long.

901
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,666
And now...

902
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,800
after all these years, to have you here...

903
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,721
I love gravy.

904
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:23,727
- You won't be leaving me again.
- Lemonade.

905
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:27,016
You'll be staying put for a long while.

906
01:16:32,525 --> 01:16:34,727
He looks like a burrito.

907
01:16:35,116 --> 01:16:36,708
Sleep of the just.

908
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:43,750
Did you ever know the old lady?
Rose, you ever know your grandma?

909
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:47,204
She died when I wasn't even born yet.

910
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,793
You missed a saint.
I owe her my life.

911
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:56,373
She tended my sorry body
after that bee darn near killed me.

912
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:01,468
Nasty, nasty bees.

913
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,906
Nasty...

914
01:17:06,202 --> 01:17:08,568
buzzy bees.

915
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:10,484
Course I...

916
01:17:10,744 --> 01:17:14,419
I can see more than most,
even with my eyes closed.

917
01:17:14,614 --> 01:17:15,562
Yes.

918
01:17:15,893 --> 01:17:18,281
I can see birds and...

919
01:17:18,548 --> 01:17:21,132
rabbits and...

920
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:27,115
curious little girls hiding behind bushes.

921
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:34,404
I can see everything you can imagine.

922
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:38,439
Course...

923
01:17:39,432 --> 01:17:42,660
curious little girls hiding behind bushes...

924
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:45,405
sometimes see more than they should.

925
01:17:46,852 --> 01:17:49,469
Best minding one's own business,
you hear me?

926
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:53,084
Otherwise, Rose,
bad things might happen.

927
01:17:53,505 --> 01:17:56,700
Bad, bad things might happen
under the sun.

928
01:18:02,108 --> 01:18:05,238
You smell awful.
You reek of the devil, Rose!

929
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:13,965
You're dead.

930
01:18:16,053 --> 01:18:18,255
You finished making that trap, Dickens?

931
01:18:18,931 --> 01:18:19,879
Dickens!

932
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:24,519
Nasty.

933
01:18:25,136 --> 01:18:26,215
Diseased.

934
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:39,815
Come on, hurry up now, Dickens.

935
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:42,141
Nasty.

936
01:19:25,743 --> 01:19:27,531
Sateen Lips?

937
01:19:28,942 --> 01:19:30,501
Baby Blonde?

938
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:36,744
- Are you there?
- Yeah, hallelujah.

939
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:43,204
Behold brothers and sisters,
she's been washed in the blood of Jesus.

940
01:19:43,397 --> 01:19:45,730
A full recovery is expected.

941
01:19:46,021 --> 01:19:49,979
I've never been so happy.
I'm alive!

942
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:53,917
Jeliza-Rose, you know I love you,
don't you?

943
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,377
Honey, I'm sorry.

944
01:19:56,575 --> 01:19:58,297
I'll do something nice for you soon.

945
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,499
- I promise, baby.
- Hallelujah. She's born again.

946
01:20:01,212 --> 01:20:05,782
- Jesus is giving her a new brain.
- Have some chocolate.

947
01:20:05,977 --> 01:20:08,975
Wash me in the blood

948
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,377
Rise and shine, dear.

949
01:20:15,765 --> 01:20:17,586
Mustique's alive!

950
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,687
She's okay and happy.

951
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:22,919
Just a dream. Trust me.

952
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:26,150
- I know everything.
- Stop it.

953
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:28,969
Stop pretending you're her.

954
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:32,129
I have no idea what you're talking about.

955
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:34,817
It's not just a dream!

956
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,326
That's what you get! You're a bad dog!

957
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:58,772
Hi, Jeliza-Rose.

958
01:20:59,037 --> 01:21:03,257
I better go because I didn't knock
and that's rude. So I'll go, okay?

959
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:07,150
I didn't knock, so I'll go, okay?

960
01:21:07,352 --> 01:21:09,969
Don't go! Don't go.

961
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,775
I've got good news.
Mustique's all right!

962
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:16,752
She's in the hospital
but she's got a body...

963
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:19,759
and she's gonna get a real brain too!

964
01:21:19,953 --> 01:21:22,799
I'd like a new brain sometimes.

965
01:21:23,024 --> 01:21:26,251
Because I think a new one is shiny!

966
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:29,291
Yeah. She was happy.

967
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:32,035
I guess she isn't a doll any more.

968
01:21:32,395 --> 01:21:34,019
She must be pretty.

969
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:37,663
She's beautiful.

970
01:21:38,759 --> 01:21:41,856
She's fabulous, dear.

971
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:48,832
And we're gonna make you fabulous
too, darling.

972
01:21:55,838 --> 01:21:57,015
That one.

973
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:01,044
Scarlet Surrender is best.

974
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:04,121
Now, sit still...

975
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:08,944
- or you'll make me do it wrong.
- I won't move a muscle.

976
01:22:09,142 --> 01:22:12,752
As I don't have muscles anyway,
so I won't move them.

977
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:16,114
Puff your lips.

978
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,799
Get ready.

979
01:22:38,471 --> 01:22:39,583
There.

980
01:22:44,484 --> 01:22:46,305
I think you're nice.

981
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:54,875
It's silly.

982
01:22:56,573 --> 01:22:58,514
You got red on me.

983
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:00,630
Silly kisser.

984
01:23:03,225 --> 01:23:06,965
The old lady who lived here
was a silly kisser too.

985
01:23:07,767 --> 01:23:09,260
She kissed me.

986
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:11,979
That was when I was little.

987
01:23:12,181 --> 01:23:14,002
She was my grandma.

988
01:23:15,379 --> 01:23:17,233
She never kissed me...

989
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:21,099
because I didn't get born yet.

990
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:24,969
Sometimes she did this in my mouth...

991
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:29,283
and that was fun.

992
01:23:29,867 --> 01:23:32,648
It was a snake, I think...

993
01:23:32,969 --> 01:23:35,750
or a goldfish dancing.

994
01:23:36,296 --> 01:23:39,971
Some days I'd be here all day
kissing with her.

995
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:44,221
She's a nice lady. Except she's dead.

996
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,593
Dickens...

997
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:52,060
she was your girlfriend.

998
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:55,220
You were her boyfriend.

999
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,680
No...

1000
01:24:02,906 --> 01:24:06,700
I was her cutie... I was her little cutie.

1001
01:24:07,415 --> 01:24:09,388
But she...

1002
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:13,682
she did fall down the steps and die.

1003
01:24:14,995 --> 01:24:18,091
I ran down when she did that.

1004
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:22,538
Because I was just little,
I didn't know what to do.

1005
01:24:23,407 --> 01:24:25,707
I was scared.

1006
01:24:27,948 --> 01:24:31,775
- She's nice lady. - Dickens...

1007
01:24:37,223 --> 01:24:39,131
you're a little cutie.

1008
01:24:45,858 --> 01:24:48,093
You're a little cutie too.

1009
01:24:53,694 --> 01:24:55,319
Silly kissers!

1010
01:24:55,836 --> 01:24:57,461
Silly kissers!

1011
01:24:58,651 --> 01:24:59,512
Silly...

1012
01:25:02,553 --> 01:25:03,501
A bomb!

1013
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:07,411
They're exploding the ground!

1014
01:25:08,309 --> 01:25:11,472
It's bigger than firecrackers
and bullets.

1015
01:25:11,668 --> 01:25:16,400
- I love firecrackers.
- Me too. I really do.

1016
01:25:39,493 --> 01:25:41,696
It's the boom hole!

1017
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:43,712
It's the edge of the world.

1018
01:25:43,907 --> 01:25:45,978
It's the Hundred Year Ocean.

1019
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:56,663
I got a secret.

1020
01:25:58,043 --> 01:26:00,944
If I say, you can't tell, okay?

1021
01:26:01,913 --> 01:26:06,896
Because if Dell knows she'll wallop me
good and I'll be in trouble forever.

1022
01:26:07,126 --> 01:26:08,238
What is it?

1023
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:13,290
It's a giant atom bomb.

1024
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:16,336
And the end of the whole world.

1025
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:20,521
Yeah, like a big tidal wave
that goes whoosh!

1026
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:24,290
And everything gets cleaned away
like chemicals...

1027
01:26:24,524 --> 01:26:28,036
and the Baby Jesus returns
forever and ever.

1028
01:26:28,298 --> 01:26:29,726
Amen.

1029
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:31,714
I wanna see.

1030
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:37,726
I don't know. Maybe tomorrow
when Dell drives to town.

1031
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:40,798
If you show me...

1032
01:26:42,563 --> 01:26:44,384
you can keep the arm.

1033
01:26:45,281 --> 01:26:49,621
Is it a boy or a girl?
Because a girl is nice, I think.

1034
01:26:49,855 --> 01:26:52,854
- It's a boy.
- How can you tell?

1035
01:27:00,569 --> 01:27:05,617
- No, that doesn't mean it's a boy.
- Yes, it does.

1036
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:08,084
It's a thingy.

1037
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:10,891
You got a thingy. I know.

1038
01:27:11,123 --> 01:27:13,871
No, that's wrong. I don't have that.

1039
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:16,587
I don't have that.

1040
01:27:17,424 --> 01:27:18,700
Dickens.

1041
01:27:21,358 --> 01:27:22,884
Dickens...

1042
01:27:25,548 --> 01:27:27,881
I'd like to see your secret.

1043
01:27:28,779 --> 01:27:30,120
I don't know.

1044
01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:36,708
You're my boyfriend.

1045
01:27:37,829 --> 01:27:39,290
My cutie.

1046
01:27:41,508 --> 01:27:44,092
You're my dear sweet Captain...

1047
01:27:45,569 --> 01:27:47,543
and I'm Mrs Captain.

1048
01:27:48,703 --> 01:27:50,807
I don't understand that.

1049
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:55,096
I better go home, I think.

1050
01:28:22,861 --> 01:28:27,780
Dickens has a girlfriend.
He's your boyfriend.

1051
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:29,951
He's my husband.

1052
01:28:30,217 --> 01:28:33,827
And I... I... I...

1053
01:28:34,151 --> 01:28:35,360
I'm his wife.

1054
01:28:35,591 --> 01:28:39,167
He's dreamboat. He's a sunny cloud.

1055
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:40,604
Kiss me.

1056
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:44,665
- You're a girl.
- Kiss me and I'll be a boy.

1057
01:28:45,281 --> 01:28:50,265
- Girls don't kiss girls that way.
- Please.

1058
01:28:56,283 --> 01:28:58,169
Oh baby.

1059
01:29:04,023 --> 01:29:05,910
You're disgusting.

1060
01:29:06,134 --> 01:29:09,394
That was fun. That was great.

1061
01:29:09,587 --> 01:29:13,098
- You're my best friend.
- And you're mine too.

1062
01:29:13,329 --> 01:29:15,433
And I love Dickens!

1063
01:29:15,856 --> 01:29:20,491
He's the sweet prince.
He's the great king.

1064
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:23,713
He's apply juice and jerky!

1065
01:29:24,012 --> 01:29:25,866
We're a happy family.

1066
01:29:26,059 --> 01:29:29,602
And Dell will marry daddy
and look after us all.

1067
01:29:30,057 --> 01:29:34,975
And we'll explore the Hundred
Years Ocean. It's a dream come true.

1068
01:29:35,206 --> 01:29:37,212
It's Christmas!

1069
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:54,197
And what do we have here?

1070
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:58,863
I think a baby is in me from kissing.

1071
01:29:59,289 --> 01:30:03,891
I think it's Mustique.
I think she's come back.

1072
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:07,120
Tell Dickens.
Tell him about the baby.

1073
01:30:07,316 --> 01:30:11,537
Then he'll let you see his special secret.
Maybe he's alone.

1074
01:30:13,265 --> 01:30:15,304
But maybe Dell's still there.

1075
01:30:18,339 --> 01:30:19,483
Let's go.

1076
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:23,226
Let's go see Dickens special secret
in his room.

1077
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:32,022
My sweet honey rose

1078
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:35,959
Strange dark flower rose

1079
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:37,234
Jeliza-Rose

1080
01:30:53,936 --> 01:30:56,487
Hello? It's us.

1081
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,979
It's Jeliza-Rose.

1082
01:31:03,914 --> 01:31:06,279
It's a real nice day for a tea party.

1083
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:11,363
Me and Glitter Gal are here...
in case you're not too busy.

1084
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:50,604
Jeliza-Rose. See what happens when
you're small and hungry all the time?

1085
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:54,060
You're nasty. You deserve it.

1086
01:31:54,287 --> 01:31:56,675
Maybe I am nasty,
but at least I'm alive.

1087
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:59,559
Get out while you can,
or she'll close a trap on you too!

1088
01:32:00,044 --> 01:32:04,100
Shut up. Shut up!

1089
01:32:05,609 --> 01:32:09,666
It's not fair! I didn't know
you were there. You scared me good!

1090
01:32:09,862 --> 01:32:12,228
No, no, it was an accident.

1091
01:32:12,549 --> 01:32:15,449
You just got spooked, that's all.

1092
01:32:15,652 --> 01:32:18,846
- It was all them ugly dead things and all.
- No, that's not right.

1093
01:32:19,105 --> 01:32:20,511
No, that's not right.

1094
01:32:20,737 --> 01:32:24,346
Because Dell makes them alive again
and that's what she does!

1095
01:32:24,543 --> 01:32:27,956
And she's Jesus how she makes
them alive again!

1096
01:32:29,212 --> 01:32:31,545
You scared me good,
I didn't know you was there!

1097
01:32:31,803 --> 01:32:33,209
I think I fainted.

1098
01:32:33,753 --> 01:32:35,029
I'm sorry.

1099
01:32:35,225 --> 01:32:38,038
Don't do that again or I'll die, okay?

1100
01:32:38,519 --> 01:32:39,598
Okay.

1101
01:32:40,662 --> 01:32:42,930
All right. I'm sorry.

1102
01:32:43,956 --> 01:32:46,954
I think I'm sorry too. Think so.

1103
01:32:51,664 --> 01:32:53,005
Dickens...

1104
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,771
Glitter Gal wants to tell you something.

1105
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:08,996
That baby sounds like a strange thing.

1106
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:13,411
We can build a castle...
and Dell will marry my daddy.

1107
01:33:14,307 --> 01:33:15,517
But...

1108
01:33:16,003 --> 01:33:19,863
you have to show me
your special secret first.

1109
01:33:23,455 --> 01:33:25,788
No, I can't build a castle.
I don't know how.

1110
01:33:26,013 --> 01:33:28,761
I don't know how. No.

1111
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:34,671
Dickens... if you show me your secret...

1112
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:37,549
I'll love you forever.

1113
01:33:45,235 --> 01:33:49,837
I'll show you, okay? Just once only.

1114
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:55,234
But if I don't unpack this bag before
Dell gets back, I won't eat tonight.

1115
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:58,217
So you wait, okay? You wait.

1116
01:33:58,476 --> 01:34:01,257
Don't touch nothing.
This is Dell's place.

1117
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:02,497
All right.

1118
01:34:03,433 --> 01:34:05,471
I'll wait for my cutie.

1119
01:34:06,471 --> 01:34:08,063
You're my kisser.

1120
01:34:13,124 --> 01:34:16,156
What do you wanna see his special
secret for? You're better off not knowing.

1121
01:34:16,322 --> 01:34:18,492
Look what happens. I was curious.

1122
01:34:19,681 --> 01:34:21,240
You know what Dell's gonna do to me?

1123
01:34:21,408 --> 01:34:22,684
We have to help him.

1124
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:28,022
You do it. I don't wanna get in trouble.

1125
01:34:30,139 --> 01:34:32,505
That's it, that's it. I'm free, I'm free!

1126
01:34:51,407 --> 01:34:54,700
We can't wake mama,
so we can't talk like this...

1127
01:34:54,957 --> 01:34:57,127
unless we talk like this first.

1128
01:34:59,659 --> 01:35:01,316
Because we're ghosts.

1129
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:06,494
- We're quiet ghosts.
- Nice.

1130
01:35:08,837 --> 01:35:11,519
Your house is the witch's cave.

1131
01:35:12,324 --> 01:35:16,064
We're disappearing
and we won't get caught.

1132
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,656
Yeah, that's a good idea, I think.

1133
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:21,562
Because Dell will wallop me
for having company.

1134
01:35:40,021 --> 01:35:42,027
It's Halloween.

1135
01:35:56,811 --> 01:35:59,876
My room! My room, my room.

1136
01:36:01,865 --> 01:36:06,467
You better get on the bed so you don't
crush nothing important, okay?

1137
01:36:06,695 --> 01:36:07,588
Okay.

1138
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,986
- Is there candy in it?
- No.

1139
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,885
It's my special secret.

1140
01:36:33,528 --> 01:36:37,300
It's the eight wonder.
The great wave.

1141
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:40,914
The end of the world!

1142
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:42,350
Dynamite.

1143
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:46,949
- How do you explode them?
- Like a firecracker, I think.

1144
01:36:47,152 --> 01:36:51,372
Like a war bomb! Boom! Kaboom!

1145
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:53,985
And everything gets cleaned away.

1146
01:36:54,413 --> 01:36:58,055
The end of the world. Blown to bits.

1147
01:36:58,794 --> 01:37:00,517
So I'll keep them.

1148
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:04,290
Yeah, I'll keep them until I'm an old man...

1149
01:37:04,999 --> 01:37:09,404
and then I'll kill that shark...
and I'll be a hero...

1150
01:37:09,605 --> 01:37:10,913
I'm pretty sure.

1151
01:37:11,268 --> 01:37:15,488
And I'll help you.
That way we can be on TV.

1152
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,926
Because you love me.

1153
01:37:24,669 --> 01:37:26,969
I'm your wife forever.

1154
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:42,826
That's baby's asleep, I think.

1155
01:37:44,017 --> 01:37:45,642
It's snoring.

1156
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:48,940
She's growing.

1157
01:37:50,094 --> 01:37:51,719
She's coming tonight...

1158
01:37:52,429 --> 01:37:53,323
or tomorrow.

1159
01:37:54,892 --> 01:37:56,746
I bet she's pretty.

1160
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:01,087
I bet she's pretty,
I bet she's pretty like you.

1161
01:38:04,774 --> 01:38:06,300
Where's that place?

1162
01:38:07,781 --> 01:38:10,398
The whole bottom of the ocean.

1163
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:15,992
There are whole cities there,
with people and dogs.

1164
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:21,436
There are castles there...
and farms and husbands and wives...

1165
01:38:21,661 --> 01:38:25,685
and babies, and ghosts...

1166
01:38:26,746 --> 01:38:28,884
and silly kissers too.

1167
01:38:29,402 --> 01:38:31,735
And kissers that do this...

1168
01:39:01,256 --> 01:39:04,004
- It's mama, I think.
- Is she awake?

1169
01:39:04,422 --> 01:39:06,014
I don't know.

1170
01:39:07,173 --> 01:39:09,986
Because that never happens,
but maybe it happens.

1171
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:14,078
If mama quit dozing
I'll go see if she wants soup.

1172
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,437
Dickens, I'm scared.

1173
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:20,412
Me too.

1174
01:39:20,669 --> 01:39:24,148
If we go together, we're safe.

1175
01:39:25,659 --> 01:39:26,968
Yeah, all right.

1176
01:39:46,096 --> 01:39:47,240
Mama?

1177
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,943
It's damn bad.

1178
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:05,469
Dell says someday mama will wake.

1179
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:10,238
And she says someday there'll be a
pill or a story or something...

1180
01:40:10,403 --> 01:40:13,216
and that'll make her eyes
come alive again.

1181
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:17,333
Because if she gets buried
she'll be gone for good.

1182
01:40:18,015 --> 01:40:19,988
That's my gift.

1183
01:40:23,004 --> 01:40:25,206
And that's daddy's map!

1184
01:40:26,202 --> 01:40:28,568
No, no, they're Dell's.

1185
01:40:29,528 --> 01:40:31,022
It's all hers.

1186
01:40:32,343 --> 01:40:34,513
Her place is with mama.

1187
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:47,397
It's daddy.

1188
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:53,666
And that's Dell.
She was beautiful once.

1189
01:40:53,867 --> 01:40:55,721
Not a pirate or a ghost.

1190
01:40:56,617 --> 01:41:00,096
She had two good eyes
and she loved your daddy.

1191
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,547
They were kissers.

1192
01:41:03,845 --> 01:41:05,600
Young kissers.

1193
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:09,212
Dell and my daddy were young kissers.

1194
01:41:09,379 --> 01:41:10,240
No.

1195
01:41:10,434 --> 01:41:12,637
They do it like we do it.

1196
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,079
No, no...

1197
01:41:17,886 --> 01:41:19,772
They do it like we do it.

1198
01:41:22,396 --> 01:41:23,769
I'm Dell...

1199
01:41:24,123 --> 01:41:27,733
and you're my daddy...
and we're married...

1200
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:30,516
and our baby's coming.

1201
01:41:37,171 --> 01:41:39,243
Filth! Evil!

1202
01:41:39,442 --> 01:41:41,034
Rotten! Rotten!

1203
01:41:41,234 --> 01:41:42,694
No, Dell!

1204
01:41:42,928 --> 01:41:47,595
Doing that in here!
Dickens, bringing that nasty...

1205
01:41:47,821 --> 01:41:50,438
- nastiness into our home!
- No, Dell, no.

1206
01:41:50,668 --> 01:41:53,001
This is my room, mama's...

1207
01:41:53,611 --> 01:41:57,438
I'm sorry, Dell, I'm sorry.

1208
01:41:57,672 --> 01:41:59,297
Like father like daughter!

1209
01:42:00,967 --> 01:42:05,924
Spy! Watching in the bushes,
you vile nasty child!

1210
01:42:05,924 --> 01:42:07,581
- I didn't do anything! - Liar!

1211
01:42:07,843 --> 01:42:08,770
Dell...

1212
01:42:09,027 --> 01:42:12,025
Spy... with your little spies!

1213
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:13,150
No!

1214
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,988
You'll starve now, you hear me?

1215
01:42:16,222 --> 01:42:18,643
No more food for you! No more you!

1216
01:42:18,878 --> 01:42:24,276
Dell, no, Dell!

1217
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:31,279
Now. Who have we here?

1218
01:42:32,469 --> 01:42:33,843
It's Mustique!

1219
01:42:34,069 --> 01:42:35,378
A troublesome creature.

1220
01:42:35,572 --> 01:42:38,418
- She's mine! I hate you!
- I don't think so. No, no, no.

1221
01:42:41,777 --> 01:42:44,710
Now look at what you done.
Look at what you done now!

1222
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:47,368
All right.

1223
01:42:47,598 --> 01:42:49,768
All right, my boy.

1224
01:42:49,996 --> 01:42:52,809
- Dell's here. Dell's got...
- Leave him alone!

1225
01:42:53,035 --> 01:42:55,073
- Leave him! Witch!
- Get off me!

1226
01:42:55,274 --> 01:42:56,680
Leave him!

1227
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:03,650
Mama.

1228
01:43:06,147 --> 01:43:08,415
I've got your hat, you witch!

1229
01:43:08,642 --> 01:43:10,812
Now you'll get stung by bees and die.

1230
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:13,789
You'll die.
And get out in the earth and die!

1231
01:43:14,016 --> 01:43:15,030
Mama.

1232
01:43:35,924 --> 01:43:37,003
You're gonna die now!

1233
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:48,652
I didn't do anything! I didn't!

1234
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:51,174
I didn't do anything!

1235
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:56,031
She's got them all, daddy. I'm next.

1236
01:43:56,233 --> 01:43:59,843
When she finds the squirrel gone
she'll destroy me for sure.

1237
01:44:00,678 --> 01:44:04,571
Probably she'll hang my head
in her living room!

1238
01:44:11,968 --> 01:44:15,381
You're dreaming yourself
far away, daddy.

1239
01:44:16,669 --> 01:44:19,483
Further than the Hundred Years Ocean.

1240
01:44:21,819 --> 01:44:23,705
Beyond Jutland...

1241
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:28,694
deep, deep, deep...
in the place where dreams are made.

1242
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,203
We'll be a happy family.

1243
01:44:35,155 --> 01:44:38,601
We'll build a castle of crooked branches...

1244
01:44:39,281 --> 01:44:41,167
and flattened pennies.

1245
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,915
Eat meat...

1246
01:44:44,463 --> 01:44:48,323
and butter tarts... and drink lemonade...

1247
01:44:48,557 --> 01:44:51,457
from gold-plated paper cups.

1248
01:44:54,889 --> 01:44:57,222
I'll dream myself there too.

1249
01:44:58,311 --> 01:45:02,367
If I shut my eyes and try hard enough...

1250
01:45:03,301 --> 01:45:06,365
maybe I'll wake inside your dream.

1251
01:45:28,279 --> 01:45:30,285
The end of the world.

1252
01:47:08,737 --> 01:47:09,849
Dickens!

1253
01:47:13,054 --> 01:47:17,591
You killed it!
You killed the monster shark, Dickens!

1254
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:21,042
I love you.

1255
01:47:33,171 --> 01:47:34,185
Little girl.

1256
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:37,391
Are you hurt?

1257
01:47:38,192 --> 01:47:40,013
Are you okay, little girl?

1258
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:45,795
I'm hungry is all.

1259
01:47:48,779 --> 01:47:51,494
Well, here... I have something.

1260
01:47:59,045 --> 01:48:02,425
Are you traveling alone
or with someone?

1261
01:48:03,971 --> 01:48:05,115
Don't know.

1262
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:09,341
I guess Dickens will come and get me.

1263
01:48:09,759 --> 01:48:11,580
I'm pretty sure he will.

1264
01:48:14,717 --> 01:48:17,050
So your parents weren't on the train?

1265
01:48:21,976 --> 01:48:23,983
You're all alone like me then.

1266
01:48:25,847 --> 01:48:27,472
It happened so fast.

1267
01:48:28,245 --> 01:48:29,673
So fast.

1268
01:48:30,548 --> 01:48:33,711
We're two of the lucky ones...
thank God.

1269
01:48:35,665 --> 01:48:38,478
Very, very lucky.

1270
01:48:39,536 --> 01:48:43,908
Dickens? Dickens?

1271
01:48:45,452 --> 01:48:47,011
Dickens?

1272
01:48:48,171 --> 01:48:50,537
- You stay far. - Dickens?

1273
01:48:50,921 --> 01:48:52,676
Mess elsewhere.

1274
01:48:52,872 --> 01:48:54,594
Dickens?

1275
01:48:54,887 --> 01:48:59,195
Where are you, boy? Dickens?

1276
01:49:01,028 --> 01:49:02,914
My captain.

1277
01:49:03,426 --> 01:49:05,563
It's okay. It's okay.

1278
01:49:07,904 --> 01:49:09,464
We're safe now.

1279
01:49:12,925 --> 01:49:15,258
We'll take care of each other,
how's that?

1280
01:49:16,348 --> 01:49:19,063
And I'll make sure you get
where you're going.

1281
01:49:40,206 --> 01:49:43,368
They're beautiful. Aren't they?

1282
01:49:48,362 --> 01:49:50,500
They're my friends, you know.

1283
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,442
They have names.
