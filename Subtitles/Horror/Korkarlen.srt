At the camera: J. Jullus

4
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:20,897
Once there was a poor
Salvation Army sister at death's door.

5
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,451
She was stricken with
galloplng consumptlon,

6
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:44,173
and she had only held out
for the space of a year.

7
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:56,576
When there was no hope left
she had gone home to her mother.

8
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:06,492
Waiting at the foot of her bed
was another Salvation Army sister

9
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,849
who had once
worked alongside the sick girl.

10
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:39,969
"Don't fret over those
poor souls now, Sister Edit."

11
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:42,896
"You have done enough for them."

12
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,850
"Send for David Holm!"

13
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:51,373
"Please don't! My daughter was yours
as long as she had a spark of life."

14
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:55,696
"Let me have her to myself
now that she ls dylng."

15
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:19,246
"Slster Maria, why don't you
do as I ask? Send for David Holm!"

16
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,416
"l shall go fetch hlm at once."

17
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:07,412
"You can't be serious, asklng
David Holm to attend a death bed?"

18
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,488
"l haven't been able to find him,

19
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:13,849
but Gustavsson is looking too."

20
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,536
"He will bring him here

21
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:18,331
if that is at all possible."

22
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,335
"Poor Mrs Holm Poor Mrs Holm"

23
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,567
"l'll take her back home."

24
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:43,773
"lt wouldn't do for her husband
to see her should he come."

25
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:06,094
The evenlng on which these events took
place was not an ordinary one.

26
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,129
lt was New Year's Eve.

27
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:39,177
"Well, we will certainly know
when it's time to toast the New Year!"

28
00:11:55,498 --> 00:12:02,290
"lt's a spooky place to await midnight,
here among the dead."

29
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:23,207
"You gentlemen
are not afraid of ghosts, l hope?"

30
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:41,213
"Then I'd like to tell you a story
while we wait for the midnight hour."

31
00:12:55,898 --> 00:13:02,610
"l once had a pal called Georges,
who was generally a jolly fellow."

32
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:24,210
"He came of a good famlly, and had
studied hard at Uppsala University,

33
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,410
so he knew a bit more
than the rest of us."

34
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:28,449
"But a change would come over hlm
on New Year's Eve."

35
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:57,411
"Remember that it's New Year's Eve,
the last day of the year!"

36
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:18,333
"Whoever dies on this eve
must drive the cart of death."

37
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:47,008
"There is an old, old cart..."

38
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:08,008
no ordinary driver holds the reigns."

39
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:12,814
"He is in the service of a strict master
named Death."

40
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:34,854
"For him, a single night
is as long as 100 years on Earth."

41
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:39,813
"Night and day he must carry out
his master's business."

"Wherever he goes,
he is greeted with sorrow and despair."

45
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:14,337
"There is no escape
He must perform his sorry duty."

46
00:23:52,898 --> 00:24:00,293
"Although the horse and cart
remain the same, the driver will vary."

47
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:15,254
"The last soul to die each year,

48
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:18,097
the one who gives up the ghost

49
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,937
at the stroke of midnight,

50
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,777
is destined to be Death's driver

51
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,617
during the coming year."

52
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,737
"Now you know why i'm afraid

53
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:42,771
of something fatal happening
on New Year's Eve."

54
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:11,048
"And the odd thing is, you see,

55
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:15,774
that Georges apparently died
last New Year's Eve."

56
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:44,216
"Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived
with David Holm?"

57
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,858
"Come with me, David Holm"

58
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:08,369
"Sister Edit is dying
and she has asked for you."

59
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:43,567
"lf Sister Edit wants to see you,
you must go at once!"

60
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:50,414
"David, l can't believe it's you!
You are meant to relieve me!"

61
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:15,134
"You ought to lift me up ln your cart
and take me to the hospital."

62
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:27,328
"No living soul rides ln this cart."

63

"By the time l arrive
it is too late for a doctor."

64
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:45,617
"You know well enough
that l am no longer alive."

65
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:59,657
"But, worst of all,
you must face the consequences

66
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:04,249
of the evil you have wrought
during your lifetime."

67
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:18,055
"David, do you think i'm unaware

68
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:22,330
that it is my fault
you have met such an end?"

69
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:30,890
"lf you hadn't fallen in with me

70
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:37,366
you would have led a good life
with your wife, children and brother."

71

"By tomorrow you will have served

72
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:31,333
your time for drunken behaviour."

73
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,016
"But before you leave,

74
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:35,493
a harsher punishment awaits you."

75
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:52,296
"Behold, your brother."

76
00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:53,817
"While you were here

77
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,726
he killed a man while intoxicated,

78
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,055
and now a long prison term awaits."

79

80
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,375
to serve the sentence instead,

81
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,490
since you and you alone led him astray,

82
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:27,690
and made him a killer."

83
00:39:55,018 --> 00:40:01,457

your wicked ways, David Holm?"

84

"Yes, for only now do l realise

85
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:23,812
how it feels to have brought great
misery upon a loved one."

01:07:48,738 --> 01:07:50,888
"You made him the drunkard he is!"

175
01:09:21,338 --> 01:09:24,967

177
01:10:21,338 --> 01:10:26,207
"Run along and be saved, and
upon my soul i'll come and watch you!"

178
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:44,093
"What's the use of making such a fuss?"

179
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:46,095
"l'm a consumptive,

180
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:48,174
but l cough into people's faces

181
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:51,335
in the hope of finlshlng them off."

182
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:54,450
"Why should they be better than us?"

183
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:12,094
"He's merely amusing hlmself. He's
not as wicked as he pretends to be."

184
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:34,767
"How can you be filled with
such bitter hatred for your fellow man?"

185
01:14:45,178 --> 01:14:50,969
"You needn't worry about that.
l'll be leavlng town in a few days."

186
01:14:55,178 --> 01:14:57,897
"No, you mustn't do that!"

187
01:15:11,818 --> 01:15:16,687
"l would rather you stayed
so l may challenge you again."

188
01:15:29,618 --> 01:15:34,214
"However tempting that maybe,
I still can't stay."

189
01:15:42,378 --> 01:15:45,814
"You see, little missy,
i'm on a journey throughout Sweden,

190
01:15:45,938 --> 01:15:51,934
in search of a person
l must find at all costs."

191
01:16:00,738 --> 01:16:03,775
"Who ls this person you seek?"

192
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:14,413
"You'll know that
when l find the person in question"

193
01:17:34,618 --> 01:17:37,974
"l am the one
David Holm is looking for."

194
01:17:46,378 --> 01:17:49,097
"l am his wife."

195
01:17:55,378 --> 01:17:58,768
"l couldn't endure the life he led."

196
01:17:58,898 --> 01:18:04,609
"I deserted him, took my children
and crept away in secret."

197
01:18:30,058 --> 01:18:31,457
"l moved to this town

198
01:18:31,578 --> 01:18:35,253
for it was so far from our old home,

199
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,175
that I never expected him

200
01:18:37,298 --> 01:18:40,574
to come looking for me here."

201
01:19:23,818 --> 01:19:28,733
"You must take him back!
lt's his only hope!"

202
01:19:37,578 --> 01:19:39,455
"l didn't mean that you must

203
01:19:39,578 --> 01:19:42,809
make up your mind on the spot,

204
01:19:42,938 --> 01:19:45,657
but promise me to listen to your heart,

205
01:19:45,778 --> 01:19:48,690
and we can talk again."

206
01:20:41,738 --> 01:20:44,810
She had got the better of herself

207
01:20:44,938 --> 01:20:49,136
and asked for none of the thlngs
that belonged to this world.

208
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:18,367
"Just come with me! A surprise awaits
that will make you happy."

She wanted to replant the seed

212
01:23:24,218 --> 01:23:27,096
that had fallen among the thorns,

213
01:23:27,218 --> 01:23:29,607
and she may well have gained her end

214
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:32,491
had it not been that...

215
01:23:55,018 --> 01:23:57,327
"The doctor says it's pneumonia."

216
01:23:57,458 --> 01:24:00,575
"Her resistance is so poor

217
01:24:00,698 --> 01:24:02,495
for she has had ill health

218
01:24:02,618 --> 01:24:05,496
ever since last New Year's Eve."

219
01:24:15,178 --> 01:24:16,770
"Yes, this David Holm

220
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:18,729
has been her undoing."

221
01:24:18,858 --> 01:24:21,326
"She worries so about the situation

222
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:23,813
between him and his wife,

223
01:24:23,938 --> 01:24:26,930
but she mustn't know the truth."

224
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:49,134
"You might at least have the heart
to spare the children from infection!"

225
01:30:27,818 --> 01:30:31,447
"lt wasn't as easy to run away this time!"

226
01:30:44,178 --> 01:30:48,456
"Haven't you had enough revenge?"

227
01:31:02,618 --> 01:31:06,293
"lf only l hadn't
brought them together again!"

228
01:31:06,418 --> 01:31:10,650
"His sin would be of less magnitude
if not for me."

229
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:22,727
"You must grant me grace!
l cannot die yet!"

230
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:27,932
"l must see him turn over a new leaf!.
Just spare me a few minutes!"

231
01:31:43,138 --> 01:31:48,610
"You know l love him.
l've never loved him as l do today."

232
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:48,653
"Captive, ye of loving heart,
take leave of thy prison."

233
01:32:58,578 --> 01:33:02,537
"Come along.
There ls nothing for us to do here."

234
01:33:02,658 --> 01:33:06,571
"Those who are to receive her
will arrive shortly."

235
01:33:53,938 --> 01:33:58,056
"You know, David, if l could send
a message to humanklnd,

236
01:33:58,178 --> 01:34:02,569
"l would like to send them
a New Year's greeting."

237
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:18,327
"l would like them to dwell
on a single New Year's prayer."

238
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:23,930
"Lord, please let my soul come
to maturity before it is reaped."

239
01:35:08,258 --> 01:35:12,536
"Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!"

240
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:05,690
"No, l can't go on. l can't go on!"

241
01:36:29,058 --> 01:36:34,894
"l'm sorry, but l must go away,
and l cannot leave them behind."

242
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:49,016
"Please don't be angry with me.
lt's not my fault."

243
01:37:53,018 --> 01:37:58,536
"This will do, David. It will suffice
for the children and myself."

244
01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:10,537
"Yes, David, l see what's coming."

245
01:38:10,658 --> 01:38:14,571
"l'm obilged to watch.
l do not shirk my duty."

246
01:38:26,738 --> 01:38:31,368
"You mustn't let it happen!
Thls mustn't come to pass!"

247
01:38:31,498 --> 01:38:34,774
"Don't let those poor,
innocent creatures die!"

248
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:43,087
"l have no power over the living."

249
01:39:07,058 --> 01:39:08,457
"Where shall l turn?"

250
01:39:08,578 --> 01:39:12,014
"Should l pray to God or to Jesus?

251
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:13,891
Who can tell me

252
01:39:14,018 --> 01:39:16,578
where to direct my plea?"

253
01:39:31,418 --> 01:39:34,410
"l'm a poor, miserable sinner,

254
01:39:34,538 --> 01:39:38,326
I beseech thee Lord of life and Death!"

255
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:40,653
"l'm not worthy,

256
01:39:40,778 --> 01:39:43,690
l've broken your every commandment."

257
01:39:57,738 --> 01:39:59,888
"Sentence me to eternal night!"

258
01:40:00,018 --> 01:40:02,452
"Let nothing remain of me!"

259
01:40:02,578 --> 01:40:05,172
"Do what you like to me, my Lord,

260
01:40:05,298 --> 01:40:07,937
only spare the three of them!"

261
01:40:14,018 --> 01:40:18,296
"David, l see that l no longer
need to grieve for you!"

262
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:06,690
"She hasn't done it yet.
l made it here in tlme!"

263
01:42:52,138 --> 01:42:55,289
"Sister Edit is dead,
and l have been at her side."

264
01:42:55,418 --> 01:42:59,172
"l promised her to become
a good husband and father."

265
01:43:06,698 --> 01:43:12,170
"You're lying! Sister Maria
told me you refused to go to her."

266
01:44:03,818 --> 01:44:05,570
"Are you crying, David?"

267
01:44:17,378 --> 01:44:20,131
"No one believes l want to reform."

268
01:44:20,258 --> 01:44:25,378
"l want to be good, but no one
believes me. ls it any wonder l cry?"

269
01:44:47,058 --> 01:44:49,413
"lt's hard to believe, David."

270
01:44:49,538 --> 01:44:53,497
"But l do believe you.
Your tears convinced me."

271
01:45:24,258 --> 01:45:26,294
"l can't help crying too."

272
01:45:26,418 --> 01:45:31,014
"l won't be truly happy
until my sorrow is drained."

273
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:56,377
"Lord, please let my soul
come to maturity before it ls reaped."
