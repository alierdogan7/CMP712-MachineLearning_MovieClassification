1
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,882
Talbot Castle,
Mr. Larry.

2
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,887
Welcome home,
Larry.

3
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,769
I'm mighty glad
to be here, Father.

4
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,251
(CHUCKLING)

5
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,526
Hasn't changed
much, has it?

6
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,967
Not in 300 years, except for
a few modern conveniences.

7
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,121
Do you know
Paul Montford?

8
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,004
Sure. Just dropped
in to say hello.

9
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,684
Welcome home,
Larry.

10
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,091
We used to snitch
apples together.

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,241
(LAUGHING)

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,401
Now he's chief constable
of the district.

13
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,970
Which reminds me, I've
got to get to work.

14
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,451
See you tonight about
9:00, Sir John?

15
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,602
Fine. Glad to have
you back, Larry.

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,284
Thanks. Bye-bye.

17
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,323
So, old Paul turned
out to be a cop, huh?

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,886
Cop? Yeah, a cop. Policeman.
You know.

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,247
He's Captain Montford,
retired.

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,326
LARRY: Father.

21
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,444
I'm sorry about John.

22
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,244
Your brother's death
was a blow to all of us.

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,649
Sit down, won't you?

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,646
You know, Larry, there's developed
what amounts to a tradition

25
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,802
about the Talbot sons.

26
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,450
The elder, next in
line of succession

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,329
and so forth, is
considered in everything.

28
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,529
The younger frequently resents
the position in which he's found

29
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,090
and leaves home,
just as you did.

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,924
Yes, but, Father,
I'm here now.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,365
Fortunately.

32
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,088
But isn't it a sad commentary
on our relationship

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,241
that it took
a hunting accident

34
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,924
and your brother's
death to bring you?

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,923
ItreaHyisn%
as bad as it sounds.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,411
I've watched every
bit of news about you.

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,041
I was mighty proud when you won
the Belden Prize for research.

38
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,248
The whole business
is probably my fault.

39
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,685
See, the tradition
also insists

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,969
that the Talbots be the
stiff-necked, undemonstrative type.

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,884
Frequently, this has been carried
to very unhappy extremes.

42
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,371
Don't I know that.

43
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,771
Larry.

44
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,241
Let's decide, you and
I, that between us

45
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,561
there shall be no
more such reserve.

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,450
I'll do everything
that I can, sir.

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,329
Well, that should
be considerable.

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,482
You know, the 18 years you've been
away should have qualified you

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,131
to be of immeasurable
benefit to the estate,

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,885
since, in a great many ways, we are a
backward people, but don't quote me.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,121
(DOOR CLOSES)

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,441
SIR JOHN:
What have we got there?

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,806
It's from London, sir.

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,441
I think it's the new
part for the telescope.

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,205
Of course.
Come along, lad.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,523
Come on. Up to the attic.
It's an observatory now.

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,485
There you are, sir.
I think that has it.

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,483
I'll have
a look at it.

59
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,681
It's excellent! Where'd you
learn such precision work?

60
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,922
Optical company
in California.

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,970
We did quite a job on that
Mount Wilson Observatory.

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,247
Are you interested
in astronomy?

63
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
Not especially.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,082
I'm all right with tools.

65
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,688
In fact, I've done quite a little
work with astronomical instruments,

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,240
but when it comes to theory,
I'm pretty much of an amateur.

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,846
All astronomers
are amateurs.

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,686
When it comes to the heavens,
there's only one professional.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,681
Fine.

70
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,447
Well, I've got some things to do
before lunch. I'll leave you to it.

71
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,529
GWEN: Good afternoon, sir.
May I help you?

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,127
Why,yes. I'm looking for a gift.
Something in earrings.

73
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,931
Certainly. We have
some very nice ones.

74
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,611
There's these diamond ones.
They're very smart.

75
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,125
Or how about
these pearl ones?

76
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,601
No. I don't think
any of those will do.

77
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,287
What I'm really looking for
is something half-moon shaped

78
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,526
with spangles on it.

79
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,489
Golden.
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,324
We haven't any
like that just now.

81
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,801
Oh, yes, you have.
Don't you remember?

82
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,724
On your dressing table,
up in your room.

83
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,801
In my room?

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,645
Yes. Would you mind
getting them for me?

85
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,247
(STAMMERING) Well,
they're not for sale.

86
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,005
Well, I can't say
that I blame you.

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,162
They look so well on you.

88
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,761
Well, perhaps my father can help you.
I'll call him.

89
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,410
No, no, that
won't be necessary.

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,041
As long as I can't have the
earrings, perhaps I...

91
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,770
I'll buy a cane.

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,843
Tell me, how did you know about
the earrings in my room?

93
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,005
I'm psychic. Every time I see a
beautiful girl, I know all about her.

94
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,048
Just like that.

95
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
What kind of
cane would you like?

96
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,082
We have daywear
or eveningwear.

97
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,645
It doesn't matter.

98
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,202
There's this one, it's very smart.
Solid-gold top.

99
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,567
No, I don't think
that'll do.

100
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,043
Well, how about the little dog?
That would suit you.

101
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,610
No, thanks.

102
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,605
Well, here's one.
Would make a good putter.

103
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,210
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, it would.

104
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,327
That's funny.
Another dog.

105
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,004
No, that's a wolf.

106
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,844
A wolf?
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,130
A wolf and a star.

108
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,050
What does that mean?

109
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,724
I thought you said
you were psychic.

110
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,442
I am, but this is only wood and
silver, and it hasn't blue eyes.

111
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,926
Well then, that stick is
priced at three pounds.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,402
Three pounds? 15 dollars
for an old stick?

113
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,289
Well, that's a
very rare piece.

114
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,091
It shows the wolf and the pentagram,
the sign of the werewolf.

115
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,049
Werewolf?
What's that?

116
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,045
That's a human being who, at certain
times of the year, changes into a wolf.

117
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,202
You mean, runs around
on all fours

118
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,284
and bites and snaps
and bays at the moon?

119
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,727
(EXCLAIMS) Even worse
than that, sometimes.

120
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,527
What big eyes
you have, Grandma.

121
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,770
<i>Little Red Riding Hood<i>
was a werewolf story.

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,561
Of course, there have been many others.
There's an old poem,

123
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,241
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night

124
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,926
"May become a wolf
when the wolfsbane blooms

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,604
"and the autumn
moon is bright"

126
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,524
Yes, but what's this
pentagram business?

127
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,523
Every werewolf is
marked with that,

128
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,683
and sees it in the palm
of his next victim's hand.

129
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,366
Look, lady, if you're trying
to scare me out of here,

130
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,647
you're not
getting very far.

131
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,046
I'll take the cane.

132
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,451
(LAUGHS)

133
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,921
Please tell me, have you
ever seen me before?

134
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,561
Of course. How do you suppose
I knew about the earrings?

135
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,125
I can't remember ever...

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,486
Tell you what we'll do.

137
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,803
We'll take a little walk tonight
and we'll talk it over.

138
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,927
No.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,650
(HORSES APPROACHING)

140
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,721
See you at 8:00.

141
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,847
No!

142
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,286
Gypsies, huh?

143
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,169
Yes, they're
fortune-tellers.

144
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,402
They pass through
here every autumn.

145
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,006
You know, I haven't had
my fortune told in years.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,525
How about tonight?

147
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,681
No.

148
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,328
Fine, I'll be
here at 8:00.

149
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,962
Yes, that's the
sign of the werewolf.

150
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,247
That's just a legend,
though, isn't it?

151
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,688
Yes, but like most legends, it
must have some basis in fact.

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
It's probably an
ancient explanation

153
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,208
of the dual personality
in each of us.

154
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,248
How does it go?

155
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,449
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night

156
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,649
"May become a wolf
when the wolfsbane blooms

157
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,524
"and the autumn
moon is bright"

158
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,728
That's funny.
That's the same thing

159
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,962
the girl in
the antique shop said.

160
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,611
SIR JOHN: Oh, you met
Gwen Conliffe, have you?

161
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,880
So that's her name!

162
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,485
I was just looking
the town over.

163
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,086
Naturally. Continue
to look it over.

164
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,884
But I want you to know
not only the pretty girls,

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,042
but the old men and women
and the young men.

166
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,407
Get to know all about them, Larry.
They're nice people.

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,484
They're your people. After all,
you're going to run the estate.

168
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,563
Of course, I want to
know all of them.

169
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,564
You seem to have made
a pretty good start.

170
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,166
Run along.
Get on with the good work.

171
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,561

Oh! It's you.

Why, of course.
Who did you expect?

Why, nobody.

177
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,447
I told you I couldn't
go out with you.

178
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,205
And yet you wore those
earrings that I like.

179

just because I...

No.

209
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,682
Well, maybe if you took
a little walk with me,

210
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,967
I could tell
your fortune.

Well, not exactly.

You see, a telescope has
a mighty sharp eye.

216
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,570
It brings the stars so close that
you feel you can almost touch them.

- A telescope?
- Sure.

218

And it does the same thing
to people in their rooms.

That is, if you point it
in the right direction.

Oh, you wouldn't.

testing the refractor.

of a sudden, there you were.

Well, from now on, I'll be
sure to draw the curtains.

Larry, Paul wants to ask
you some questions.

346
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,966
Why, sure, sure.
Go ahead.

347
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,883
No, I think we ought
to leave him alone.

348
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,644
What's the
matter with you?

349
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,768
Paul wants to question him.
Go ahead, Paul.

350
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,923
Yeah, go ahead. But don't
try to make me believe

351
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,321
that I killed a man when I
know that I killed a wolf.

352
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,927
Yes, yes. We're all
a little bit confused.

353
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,048
He needs a good rest.

354
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,605
We'll talk to
you later, Larry.

355
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,330
Come on, Doctor.

356
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,209
Coming, Sir John?

357
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,362
Yeah. I'll be
down in a minute.

358
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,451
Now, Larry, will you stop
worrying and let me handle this?

359
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,330
But they're treating
me like I was crazy!

360
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,802
I'm not accusing him
of foul play, Sir John,

361
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,850
but, after all, two people are
dead, and I am chief constable.

362
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,968
That's no reason to make a
great mystery out of it.

363
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,485
You talk like a
detective in a novel.

364
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,291
Now, please, gentlemen. There's
a very simple explanation.

365
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,051
A dog or a wolf attacked Jenny
Williams, that's proven.

366
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,851
When she cried for help, Larry
and Bela went to her rescue.

367
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,970
It was dark. Excitement and confusion.
The Gypsy was killed.

368
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,530
What about
Bela's bare feet?

369
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,762
He just didn't have time
to put his shoes on.

370
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,410
And what about this
nonexistent wound?

371
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,641
Larry imagined
he'd been bitten.

372
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,371
After all, the beast jumped at
him and tore his coat to shreds.

373
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,169
Still, he insists
he received a wound.

374
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,366
You tell me his
coat was bloody

375
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,487
when the two women
brought him in.

376
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,801
Surely, a wound
can't heal overnight.

377
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,168
The patient is mentally disturbed.
Perhaps the shock did it.

378
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,323
I'd rather you didn't bother
him with questions just now.

379
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,926
You policemen are
always in such a hurry.

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,321
As if dead men
hadn't all eternity.

381
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,006
Well,you'll be declaring
me a mental case next.

382
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,651
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no.
I wouldn't dare.

383
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,324
Thank you.

384
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,846
In return, I won't question your
patient again, until you think fit.

385
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,285
Thank you.

386
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,010
It's the Gypsy
fortune-teller.

387
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,923
And the man
that killed him.

388
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,004
PRIEST: But, my dear woman, we can't
bury this man without prayer.

389
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,765
There is nothing
to pray for, sir.

390
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,686
Bela has entered a much
better world than this.

391
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,651
At least, so you ministers
always say, sir.

392
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,044
And so it is. But that's no reason
to hold a pagan celebration.

393
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,929
I hear your people
are coming to town,

394
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,049
dancing and singing
and making merry.

395
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,411
For a thousand years, we Gypsies
have buried our dead like that.

396
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,610
I couldn't break the custom
even if I wanted to.

397
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,126
Fighting against
superstition is as hard

398
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,567
as fighting
against Satan himself.

399
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,611
The way you walked was thorny,
through no fault of your own.

400
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,487
But as the rain
enters the soil,

401
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,086
the river enters the sea,

402
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,644
so tears run to
a predestined end.

403
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,285
Your suffering is over,
Bela, my son.

404
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,725
Now you will find peace.

405
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,842
But, my dear, there's nothing
they can accuse you of.

406
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,567
Now, here, why don't you go
up to your room and lie down?

407
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,007
I don't want to
be alone, Father.

408
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,845
As soon as I close
my eyes, I see Jenny.

409
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,489
I'd rather stay here.

410
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
Why, of course, my dear.
Of course.

411
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,521
Well, ladies. What
can I do for you...

412
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,601
Where is she?

413
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,761
CHARLES: Why, what do you
want to know from her?

414
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
I want to know why she left my little
Jenny all alone with the Gypsy.

415
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,845
Well,I suppose she
didn't want to be there

416
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,160
while the fortune
was being told.

417
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,401
Oh, what a lie!

418
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,050
You know she just wanted to
walk out in the dark with...

419
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,441
Now! You mustn't speak
of my Gwen like that.

420
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,285
(SCOFFING) Listen to him!
There's a fine father for you.

421
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,044
How dare you permit her to
walk out with other men

422
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,485
when she's engaged
to Frank Andrews.

423
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,800
CHARLES: She didn't
do anything wrong.

424
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,006
"Anything wrong"?

425
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,650
It's because of her that my
little Jenny was killed.

426
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,801
Now, that's enough!

427
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,884
She's to blame. I always knew that
innocent little face was just...

428
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,689
CHARLES: Now come on, outside!
Outside, all of you.

429
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,967
You'll not get rid of me
before I know the truth.

430
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,690
I want to know
what she was doing

431
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,364
while my little
Jenny was being murdered.

432
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,930
I'll tell you
what she was doing.

433
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,684
All right, tell me.

434
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,565
Come on. Come on.
Speak up. What was it?

435
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,165
Don't you dare touch me.

436
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,890
You and your fine daughter.

437
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,406
You've not heard
the last of this.

438
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,801
(DOOR CLOSING)

439
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,561
What's gotten into them?

440
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,290
Well, I...
I really don't know.

441
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,163
I'm sorry, sir, about getting
Gwen into this mess.

442
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,844
But there really
wasn't anything wrong.

443
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,922
I trust
my daughter, sir.

444
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,925
I hope that she didn't
hear all this row.

445
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,001
Tell me, is she in?

446
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,844
Yes, she's
in the parlor.

447
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
May I see her, please?

448
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,685
Why, of course.

449
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,091
Thank you.

450
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,841
Larry!

451
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,362
Oh, you...
You heard them.

452
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,566
Yes.

453
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,851
I suppose you can't
blame them too much.

454
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,208
Kind of a mess, isn't it?

455
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,523
I came over to tell you
how sorry I am about Jenny.

456
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,207
Tell me, just exactly
what did happen?

457
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,044
Well...

458
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,044
I saw a wolf attacking her,
and I killed it.

459
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,202
In the fight, it bit me.

460
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,282
This morning,
there's no sign of the wound.

461
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,726
Now they're trying
to make me believe

462
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,485
that I killed Bela,
the fortune-teller.

463
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,249
Well, maybe there wasn't a wolf.
It was dark and foggy,

464
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,766
and, well, perhaps
the story I told you

465
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,366
about the werewolf
confused you.

466
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,250
Why does everyone insist
that I'm confused?

467

(DOOR OPENS)

468
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,481
Hello, Frank.

00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,607
Hello, Mr. Conliffe.
ls Gwen in?

470
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,206
Yes, but she
has a visitor.

471
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,362
Larry Talbot?
Yes.

472
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,523
Well, that's all right.
I want to see him, too.

473
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,601
Larry, this is
Frank Andrews.

00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,291
You'd better take
him outside, Frank.

478
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,442
All right.
Come on, come on.

479
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,650
So that's him, huh?

480
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,530
Yes. We grew up
together.

481
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,602
He looks like
a nice enough chap.

482
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,011
What does he do?

483
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,050
He's the gamekeeper for
your father's estate.

484
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,760
Oh.

485
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,088
Glad to know you,
Andrews.

486
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,645
I just came over to see
that Gwen was all right.

487
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,688
I guess I'd
better be going now.

488
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,807
Goodbye, Gwen.

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,404
Frank, why were
you so rude?

491
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,801
Well, I'm sorry,
but...

492
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,327
I couldn't take my eyes off
that walking stick of his.

493
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,880
Gwen, be careful,
will you?

494
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,001
Careful?

495
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,367
Yes. He's been away
for 18 years, I know,

496
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,842
but he's still the son
of Sir John Talbot.

497
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,810
I see. And I'm
the daughter of Conliffe,

shop, is that it?

499

Yes, that and, well, there's something
very tragic about that man,

500
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,291
and I'm sure that nothing but harm
will come to you through him.

along by yourself,

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,086
thought you might
like to join us.

Well, thanks. I was
just on my way home.

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,130
See what you can do.

516
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,770
All right.

517
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,086
He seems to be able
to handle a rifle.

518
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,969
(GUN FIRES)

519
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,531
Go ahead and shoot,
before he bites you.

520
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,125
Bad luck.

521
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,850
(GUN FIRES)

522
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,890
See? Nothing to it.
Care to try another one?

523
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,520
No, thanks.
You win.

524
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,130
He's unstrung.

525
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,729
Long trip.

526
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,371
That unfortunate accident
the other night.

527
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,405
MALEVA: You have been
a long while coming.

528
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,766
I'm not buying anything.

529
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,888
And I am not
selling anything.

530
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,849
I expected you sooner.

531
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,330
I remember you.

532
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,290
That night,
and in the crypt.

533
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,885
Go inside.

534
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,523
You killed the wolf.

535
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,843
Well, there's no
crime in that, is there?

536
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,082
The wolf was Bela.

537
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,846
You think I don't know the
difference between a wolf and a man?

538
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,890
Bela became a wolf,
and you killed him.

539
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,646
A werewolf can be killed
only with a silver bullet,

540
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,884
or a silver knife or a stick
with a silver handle.

541
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,361
You're insane. I tell
you, I killed a wolf!

542
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,283
A plain, ordinary wolf!

543
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,362
Take this charm.

544
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,523
The pentagram,
the sign of the wolf.

545
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,762
It can break
the evil spell.

546
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,211
Evil spell,
pentagram, wolfsbane.

547
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,203
I'm sick of the whole thing!
I'm gonna get out of here.

548
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,241
Whoever is bitten by
a werewolf and lives

549
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,482
becomes a werewolf himself.

550
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,725
Quit handing
me that.

551
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,450
You're just
wasting your time.

552
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,482
The wolf bit you,
didn't he?

553
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,848
Yeah. Yeah,
he did.

554
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,163
Wear this charm
over your heart always.

555
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,801
All right,
I'll take it.

556
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,881
What's it worth to you?
I'll give you...

557
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,564
Do you dare to
show me the wound?

558
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,687
What?

559
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,161
Do you dare to
show me the wound?

560
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,487
Go now,
and Heaven help you!

561
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,526

562
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,045
Gwen!

563
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,690
Gosh, I'm glad
to see you.

564
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,489
I thought you
left with Frank.

565
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,404
We had a quarrel,
and then I...

566
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,767
Well, I'll take
you home, then.

567
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,409
We better go this way.

568
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,409
Quite a hectic night,
wasn't it?

569
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,720
Yes.

570
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,764
What's that?

571
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,330
That?

572
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,603
That's a charm. I just
saw the old Gypsy woman.

573
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,164
They give you quite
a sales talk, don't they?

574
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,651
Let me see.

575
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,682
The pentagram.

576
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,809
Yes. She said that
I was a werewolf.

577
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,083
But surely you...

578
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,009
Well, you don't
believe that...

579
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,600
Gwen, I won't
need this.

580
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,404
I want you to have it.

581
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,484
It'll protect you.

582
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,528
Protect me? From whom?

583
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,161
Me. Just in case.

584
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,566
I never accept a present without
giving something in return.

585
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,610
Here's a penny.

586
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,324

Why, the Gypsies
are all leaving.

589
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,245
I must go, too.

Hey, hey, hey! What's
all the excitement?

592
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,522

in camp.

Did you hear that,
Mr. Twiddle?

598
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,286
Of course I did. Otherwise,
I'd be snuggled all in bed.

599
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,771
Sounded like
a wild animal.

600
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,808
Might be some beast
the Gypsies left behind.

601
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,962

from the churchyard.

Let's go and see.

Very well, let us
go and have a look.

Good morning.

a better one, Doctor.

Williams was killed?

Yes.

612
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,841
Find something?

613
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,001
Animal tracks.

614
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,286

616
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,482
You're up early.

617
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,370
Yes. I heard people
in the corridor.

618
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,566
Is there
anything wrong?

619
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,484
Richardson was killed last night.
The gravedigger.

620
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,006

up to this house.

No, animal tracks.
A wolf.

623
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,566
A wolf?

624
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,603
Where do you
suppose a wolf came from?

625
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,604
He might have escaped
from the circus or a zoo.

626
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,810
What is this story about a
man turning into a wolf?

627
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,689
You mean the werewolf?

628
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,807
Yes, sir.

629
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,530
Well, it's an old legend.

630
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,490
You'll find something like it in the
folklore of nearly every nation.

631
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,483
The scientific name
for it is lycanthropia.

632
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,642
It's a variety
of schizophrenia.

633
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,006
That's all Greek to me.

634
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,531
Well, it is Greek.

635
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,809
It's a technical expression
for something very simple.

636
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,043
The good and evil
in every man's soul.

637
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,249
In this case, evil takes
the shape of an animal.

638
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,087
I can figure out
most anything

639
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,766
if you give me electric
current and tubes and wires,

640
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,649

do with my hands.

641

you can't even touch...

with you, Larry?

00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,121
Oh...

644
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,489
Oh, nothing, sir.

645
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,961
But do you believe
in these yarns?

646
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,730
Larry, to some people,
life is very simple.

647
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,566
They decide that this is good, that
is bad, this is wrong, that's right.

648
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,608
There's no right and wrong,
no good and bad.

649
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,729
No shadings and grays,
all blacks and whites.

651
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,080
Exactly.

Now, others of us find
that good, bad, right,

653
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,926
wrong are many-sided,
complex things.

We try to see every side.

655
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,883
But the more we see,
the less sure we are.

656
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,521
Now, you ask me if I believe
a man can become a wolf.

657
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,246
Well, if you mean, can he take on the
physical characteristics of an animal?

658
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,006
No. It's fantastic.
However, I do believe

659
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,562
that most anything can happen
to a man in his own mind.

something before

691
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,685
the town becomes
completely hysterical.

692
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,411
Yes, this muttering
of werewolves.

693
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,721
Come along,
Larry.

694
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,610
We're discussing this wolf that seems
to be roaming the countryside.

695
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,401
Yes, you saw him. What's he like?
Is he a big fellow?

696
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,164
It isn't a wolf.

697
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,049
What do
you mean?

698
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,610
It's a werewolf.

699
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,727
Werewolf?

700
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,006
Maybe he's right.

701
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,730
Let's have a hunt
and drive it out.

702
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,451
That'd be a valuable addition to
anybody's collection of animals.

703
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,729
Just imagine having a stuffed werewolf
staring at you from the wall.

704
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,121
LLOYD: I wouldn't
joke about it, Paul.

705
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,443
Doctor, do you believe
in werewolves?

706
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,124
Why, I believe that a man
lost in the mazes of his mind

707
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,487
may imagine
that he's anything.

708
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,326
Science has
found many examples

709
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,289
of the mind's
power over the body.

710
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,921
The case of the stigmata appearing
on the skin of zealots.

711
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,126
Self-hypnotism.

712
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,010
But if a man isn't even
thinking about the thing,

713
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,128
isn't interested in it,

714
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,488
then how could he hypnotize
himself with it?

715
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,451
It might be a case of mental
suggestion plus mass hypnotism.

716
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,682
You mean by that,
that he could be

717
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,489
influenced by
the people about him?

718
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,886
Yes. Come now, Doctor.

719
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,651
You're letting your science run
away with your common sense.

720
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,883
Have you ever met
a werewolf, Doctor?

721
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,485
Not that I know of.

722
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,087
Doctor, can these
sick people be cured?

723
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,164
Not they. An asylum's the
only safe place for them.

724
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,288
Any disease of
the mind can be cured

725
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,170
with the cooperation
of the patient.

726
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,641
Well, while you gentlemen are
figuring it out scientifically,

727
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,131
I think I'll go
and set a few traps.

728
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,884
Yes, I'll help you.
We may not find

729
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,246
anything more
than a diseased mind,

730
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,966
but even that
may be interesting.

731
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,166
Doctor, I've got
to talk to you.

732
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,841
Later. Now, I want you to
go and get some rest.

733
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,445
Go on, Larry.

734
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,891
You're the one
I want to talk to.

735
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,531
I didn't like what you said
to him about mass hypnotism.

736
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,523
Sir John, your son
is a sick man.

737
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,045
He's received
a shock that has caused

738
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,884
definite
psychic maladjustment.

739
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,405
You must send him
out of this village.

740

You're talking
like a witch doctor.

741
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,124
If my son is ill, the
best place for him is

742
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,850
in his own home,
proving his innocence.

743
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,570
Does the prestige
of your family name

744
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,165
mean more to you
than your son's health?

745
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,605
Oh, nonsense.

746
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,170
The one way for him
to get cured is to stay

747
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,123
here and fight
his way out of this.

748
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,890
And I tell you that
shock therapy is too

749
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,564

his present state.

01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,285
all the windows are locked,
and I'll bolt the door

865
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,247
so that nothing
can get in or out.

866
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,731
Now you'll see
that this evil thing

867
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,041
you've conjured up
is only in your mind.

868
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,924
KENDALL: Sir John!
Yes?

869
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,561
Captain Montford and the men are
waiting for you and Master Larry.

870
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,607
I'm coming.

871
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,047
But you're going to stay
with me, aren't you?

872
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,441
No, I've got to go, Larry.
These people have a problem.

873
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,491
You must make your own fight, but
we'll settle this thing tonight.

874
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,607
Dad!

875
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,881
What is it?

876
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,731
Take the cane with you.

877
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,450
What do I want with a cane?

878
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,244
Please.

879
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,891
Just take it with you.
Please.

880
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,011
All right.

881
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,725
(DOOR LOCKS)

882
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,282
He should come right
across through there.

883
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,921
The beaters are driving
right towards this point.

884
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,130
Did you give your
son the sleeping pill?

885
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,281
Oh, no.

886
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,362
But I wanted him to sleep
through all this hullabaloo.

887
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,204
And I want him
cured, tonight.

888
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,886
In the morning, he'll have conclusive
proof it was all in his mind.

889
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,961
What did you do?

890
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,530
Strapped him to the chair.

891
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,410
Turned him to the window so that
he'd see something of the hunt.

892
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,369
I hope you
won't be sorry.

893
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,771
Dr. Lloyd.

894
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,886
Coming.

895
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,162
MALEVA: You are not frightened,
are you, Sir John?

896
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,446
Frightened? Of what?

897
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,766
Of the night.

898
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,204
Rubbish.
You startled me.

899
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,567
Don't be startled,
Sir John.

900
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,371
You have the silver
cane for protection.

901
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,606
Who are you?

902
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,444
Hasn't your
son told you?

903
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,529
You're the Gypsy who's been filling
his mind with this werewolf nonsense.

904
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,443
Nonsense, Sir John?
Yes.

905
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,285
You've been preying on his
gullibility with your witch's tales.

906
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,045
But you fixed him,
didn't you, Sir John?

907
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,363
You don't believe
the witch's tales, do you?

908
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,851
Not for a minute.

909
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,605
Then where were
you going, Sir John?

910
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,650
Why aren't you back there,
at the shooting stand?

911
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,644
I was. Were you hurrying
back to the castle?

912
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,449
Did you have
a moment's doubt?

913
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,922
Were you hurrying to make
sure he's all right?

914
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,367
I wanted to be with my son.
I was going...

915
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,522
(GUNS FIRING)

916
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,841
Yes, Sir John.
You were going?

917
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,489
MALEVA: Hurry,
Sir John. Hurry.

918
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,483
Come around
this way, men!

919
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,483
Swing out to the right
there, come through again.

920
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,825
Wykes, you and
Phillips take charge.

921
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,526
I could have sworn I hit him dead on!
And I, too.

922
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,321
Have you forgotten it takes a
silver bullet for a werewolf?

923
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,481
Have you seen Larry?

924
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,601
Don't go through the woods.

925
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,047
Why?
Listen. The hunt is on.

926
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,610
But... But I want
to help him.

927
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,091
You'd better
come with me.

928
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,083
No. I've got
to find him.

929
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,561
Come with me or
he will find you.

930
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,566
(EXCLAIMS)

931
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,684
(GROWLING)

932
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,805
(WOLF MAN GROWLS)

933
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,528
(SCREAMING)

934
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,130
(GROANING)

935
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,769
(SNARLING)

936
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:13,408
The way you walked was thorny,
through no fault of your own.

937
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,850
But as the rain enters the soil,
the river enters the sea,

938
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,367
so tears run to
a predestined end.

939
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,771
Your suffering is over.

940
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,605
Now you will find
peace for eternity.

941
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,724
Down this way, men.

942
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,405
Gwen! Are you
all right?

943
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,645
The wolf must have attacked her,
and Larry came to the rescue.

944
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,484
I'm sorry, Sir John.

945
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,961
Larry!
