Rick!

He just snuck up on me!
He clocked me in the face!

4
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:10,978
Got his neck broke.

5
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:13,017
So this is where you
planned to do it...

6
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:15,232
We're gonna lay down our guns.

- Don't, they could be anywhere.

gonna need you here. <i>( Door opens )</i>

- Maybe they found Randall.

- Daryl: We found him.
- Maggie: <i>Is he back in the shed?</i>

23
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:21,770
- He's a walker.
- Did you find the walker that bit him?

24
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,739
No, the weird thing is
he wasn't bit.

Daryl: The thing is, Shane
and Randall's tracks

were right

And Shane ain't no tracker,

29
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,916
so he didn't come up behind him.
They were together.

30

Would you please get back out
there, find Rick and Shane

31

I mean, I...
I heard a gunshot,

42
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:21,031
but I didn't see
any walkers nearby.

43

- ( Whispers ) Patricia, kill the lights.
- I'll get the guns.

52
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,359
Maybe they're just passing, like the herd
on the highway. Should we just go inside?

53
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,029
Not unless there's a tunnel
downstairs I don't know about.

54
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,199

you pick up a thing or two

It's no use.

Kill as many as we can,

and we'll use the cars
to lead the rest of them off the farm.

70

- Are you serious?
- This is my farm.

71
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,736
I'll die here.

72
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:40,872

Drop the lighter when I say.

79

We'll stop some of them
from reaching the house

80
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,759
and distract the others, so
at least we'll have a chance.

You can do this.

He was here.

Shane who started that fire.

There's no corralling them.

We're gonna run out of ammo
before we even make a dent.

for the woods now,

I can't find him anywhere.

- Not in the cellar or the attic.
- Why can't he listen for once?

124
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:46,725
Ok okay, if he followed
his daddy, he went that way.

No, you'll lead 'em right to him.
We can't stay here!

his mother. We've gotta go.

I'd say yes.

- Go.

Oh my God.

All right, let's just...
lLet's just circle back to the highway.

190
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,167
Did you see my dad?
Did... did he make it?

191
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,803
- Did you see?
- I couldn't see anything.

192
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,473
And Beth... I lost Beth.
We've gotta go back there.

193
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,308

There's nothing to go back to.

she was with Lori.

- Did they make it?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

197

Patricia? Jimmy?

198
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,521
What if they didn't make it?
What if nobody made it?

199
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:40,456
They made it, okay?

200
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,191
They had to.

201
00:19:42,193 --> 00:19:43,692
All right, let's just

202
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:46,328
circle around to the highway
where we left supplies for Sophia.

203
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,997
( Crying ) No, the herd came
from that direction.

204
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:56,538

Hey, Maggie, look at me.
Look at me.

Hey, we're alive.
We made it.

Okay? I'm sure
they are, too.

Maggie, I love you.

I should've said it
a long time ago

216
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,419
and it's been true
for a long time.

217

We're gonna be all right, okay?

218
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:56,731
We'll be all right.

219
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,767

You said she'd be here.

go back for her.

- No. Why are we running?

It's... It is mom.

( Whispering ) Shh.
You need to be quiet, all right? Please.

Rick.

You've got to get
your boy to safety.

235
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:16,412
I'll wait here for my girls
and the others.

236
00:22:16,414 --> 00:22:18,881
I know a few places.

237
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,650
We'll meet up
at one of them later.

Where?
Where is safe?

239
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,424
We're not splitting up.

Please,

241
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,929
keep your boy safe.

242
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:33,397
I'll hide in one of the cars.

243
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:35,399
If a walker gets me, so be it.

244
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,434
I've lost my farm.

245
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:40,037
I've lost my wife
and maybe my daughters.

246
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,272
You don't know that.

247
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,209
They'll be here.

248
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:47,278
- And you don't know that.
- You're a man of God.

249
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,514
Have some faith.

250
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:51,149
I can't profess

251
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:54,486
to understand God's plan,

252
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:58,623
but Christ promised
the resurrection of the dead.

253
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,294
I just thought he had something

254
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:05,530
a little different in mind.

255
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,637
We stick together.

256
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:23,982
Hey, we gotta turn around.

257
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,516
Straight back to that herd?

258
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:27,385
Um, no.

259
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:29,387
The highway's back there.
That's where they'll be.

260
00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:30,855
Rick will go back
to where we first broke down

261
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:32,590
- and Glenn too.
- We're headed east,

262
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,959
get to the coast. We should've
done that from the jump.

263
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,962
Look, we've got a shot to
get out of here in one piece.

264
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:40,398
I gotta find Carl.
He may have escaped with somebody.

265
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,466
I hate to say it,
but they're on their own.

266
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,869
There's no way to even
begin to start looking.

267
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,637
( Lori cries ) You're wrong.

268
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,573
Look, we can't go back.

269
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:50,041
I'm sorry.
It's suicide.

270
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,743
All right, then let me out.

00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:55,279
- Hey! Whoa!
- ( Tires screeching )

272
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,683
Then turn around,
or you let us out right now.

273
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:02,620
I should do it,
you know. Okay?

274

- T-Dog.

275

Come come come come.

278
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,399
( Whispers ) I don't know how much
longer we can stay here.

279
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:49,037
I... I'm not leaving
without mom.

280
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,205
So we're just gonna walk away?

281
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:54,675
Not knowing if my wife, your
girls are still out there?

282
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:57,577
- How do we live with that?
- You've only got one concern now...

283
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,412
Just one...

284
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,780
Keeping him alive.

285
00:25:01,782 --> 00:25:04,150
Nature may be
throwing us a curveball,

286
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,653
but that law is still true.

287
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:21,569
Carl.

288
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:26,174
It's not safe here.

289
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:31,145

Where'd you find everyone?

293
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,176
Well, those guys' tail lights
zigzagging all over the road...

294
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,345
figured he had to be Asian,
driving like that.

295
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,682
( Chuckles ) Good one.

296
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:41,417
Where's the rest of us?

297
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:44,587
We're the only ones
who made it so far.

298

Andrea?

Hershel: <i>Patricia?</i>

302

They got her, too.

303
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:08,980
Took her right in front
of me. I was...

304
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:12,084
( crying ) I was holdin' onto
her, daddy. She just...

305
00:27:14,754 --> 00:27:17,656
what about Jimmy?
Did you see Jimmy?

306
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:20,526
He was in the RV.
It got overrun.

307
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:24,997
You definitely saw Andrea?

308
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,500
There were walkers everywhere.

- Lori: <i>We don't even know if she's there.</i>

312
00:27:34,476 --> 00:27:36,376
She isn't there.
She isn't.

313
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,845
She's somewhere else
or she's dead.

314
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:41,181
- There's no way to find her.
- So we're not even gonna look for her?

Rick:
<i>We gotta keep moving.</i>

316

the more walkers,

- I'm freezing.

We'll build a fire, yeah?

337
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,355
You go out looking

Everyone stop panicking

All right, we'll set up a perimeter.

343

In the morning,
we'll find gas and some supplies.

- No, we stay together.

00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,876
God forbid something happens and
people get stranded without a car.

347
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:50,911
Rick, we're stranded now.

348
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:53,781
I know it looks bad,
we've all been through hell and worse,

349
00:30:53,783 --> 00:30:56,150
but at least
we found each other.

350
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,886
I wasn't sure...
I really wasn't...

351
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:01,222
but we did.
We're together.

352
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,524
We keep it that way.

353
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:08,997
We'll find shelter somewhere.
There's gotta be a place.

354
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:15,336
Rick, look around.
Okay?

355
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:18,005
There's walkers everywhere.
They're migrating or something.

356
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,240
There's gotta be a place
not just where we hole up,

357
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:22,342
but that we fortify,

358
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:25,912
hunker down,
pull ourselves together,

359
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:27,713
build a <i>life for each other.</i>

360
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,982
I know it's out there.
We just have to <i>find</i> it.

361
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,717
Maggie:
<i>Even if we do find a place</i>

362
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:34,320
<i>and we think it's safe,</i>

363
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:37,490
we can never be sure.
For how long?

364
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:39,726
Look what happened
with the farm.

365
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:42,128
<i>We fooled ourselves</i>
<i>into thinking that that was safe.</i>

366
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,497
We won't make
that mistake again.

367
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:48,802
We'll make camp tonight

368
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:51,572
over there, get on the
road at the break of day.

369
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:55,242
Does this feel right to you?

370
00:31:55,244 --> 00:31:56,544
What if walkers come through,

371
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:57,979
or another group
like Randall's?

372
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:00,381
You know
I found Randall, right?

373
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:02,818
He had turned,
but he wasn't bit.

374
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:08,824
- How's that possible?
- Rick, what the hell happened?

375
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,094
Daryl:
<i>Shane killed Randall.</i>

376
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,462
Just like he always wanted to.

377
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:16,697
Lori:
And then the herd got hi

378
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,608
we're all infected.

379
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:37,719
- What?
- At the CDC,

380
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,854
Jenner told me.

381
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,526
Whatever it is,

382
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:47,129
we all carry it.

383
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,741
And you never said anything?

384
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,877
Would it have made
a difference?

385
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:02,446
- You knew this whole time?
- How could I have known for sure?

386
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,915
- You saw how crazy that mo...
- Glenn: <i>That is not your call.</i>

387
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,851
Okay, when I found out about
the walkers in the barn,

388
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,452
I told, for the good
of everyone.

389
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,888
Well, I thought it best
that people didn't know.

390
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,777
I'm sure you had your reasons.

391
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,114
- ( Kisses ) Is there anything that...
- I killed him.

392
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,054
I killed Shane.

393
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,825
He came at me.

394
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,264
He killed Randall
to get me into the woods.

395
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,366
He planned it.

396
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,638
I had...
I had no choice.

397
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,414
I gave him every chance...

398
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:48,053
And he kept
leading me further out.

399
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:54,426
He pushed me, and I let him.

400
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,297
And after awhile,
I knew...

401
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,666
I knew what he was doing,
what he was up to.

402
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:08,571
And I kept going.

403
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,142
I didn't stop.

404
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,646
I could have, but...

405
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,018
I just wanted it over.

406
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,456
Dogging me
every step of the way.

407
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,661
Acting like I stole
you and Carl, like...

408
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,497
Like I was in the way.

409
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,739
I just wanted it over.

410
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,410
I wanted him dead.

411
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:56,752
I killed him.

412
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,394
He turned.

413
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,196
That's how I knew Jenner...

414
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,699
Jenner was right.

415
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,275
Carl put him down.

416
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,923
Ooh.
( Sniffles )

417
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,493
( Crying )

418
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:40,031
( Grunts )

419
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:21,599
( Walkers growling )

420
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:26,804
( Grunting )

421
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,625
( Screaming )

422
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:19,625
<i>( Crickets chirping )</i>

423
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:36,343
( Whispering )
We're not safe with him...

424
00:38:36,345 --> 00:38:38,478
Keeping something
like that from us.

425
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:43,117
Why do you need him?
He's just gonna pull you down.

426
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,520
No. Rick's done all right by me.

427
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:48,623
You're his henchman

428
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,293
and I'm a burden.

429
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,362
You deserve better.

430
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,801
What do you want?

431
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:00,570
A man of honor.

432
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,839
Rick has honor.

433
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,976
I think we should
take our chances.

434
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,111
Hershel:
Don't be foolish.

435
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:12,647
There's no food, no fuel,

436
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:15,183
- no ammo.
- <i>( Leaves rustle )</i>

437
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,685
- What was that?
- Daryl: Could be anything.

438
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:20,321
Could be a raccoon,
could be a possum.

439
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,490
Glenn: <i>Walker.</i>

440
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,826
Carol: <i>We need to leave.</i>
<i>I mean what are we waiting for?</i>

441
00:39:24,828 --> 00:39:28,129
- Glenn: Which way?
- Maggie: It came from over there.

442
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:30,032
- Beth: Back from where we came.
- Maggie: Yeah.

443
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,534
The last thing we need is for
everyone to be running off in the dark.

444
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,471
We don't have the vehicles.

445
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,441
- No one's traveling on foot.
- <i>( Branch snaps )</i>

446
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,342
Hershel:
Don't panic.

447
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,010
I'm not...

448
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,613
I'm not sitting here, waiting for
another herd to blow through.

449
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,883
- We need to move, now.
- No one is going anywhere.

450
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:53,521
- Do something.
- I am doing something!

451
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:56,190
I'm keeping
this group together,

452
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:57,658
alive.

453
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,659
I've been doing that all along,
no matter what.

454
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,896
I didn't ask for <i>this.</i>
<i>I killed my best friend</i>

455
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:05,099
for you people,
for Christ's sake!

456
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:16,178
You saw what he was like,

457
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,280
how he pushed me,

458
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,083
how he compromised us,

459
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,619
how he threatened us.

460
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:27,289
He staged
the whole Randall thing,

461
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,492
led me out to put
a bullet in my back.

462
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,494
He gave me no <i>choice.</i>

463
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,930
He was my friend,
but he came after me.

464
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:38,433
( Carl crying )

465
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:42,470
My hands are clean.

466
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:56,818
Maybe you people are
better off without me.

467
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:00,121
Go ahead.

468
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,857
I say there's a place for us,

469
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,859
but maybe... maybe it's
just another pipe dream.

470
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,462
Maybe... maybe I'm
fooling myself again.

471
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,699
Why don't you...
Why don't you go and find out yourself?

472
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,801
<i>Send me a postcard.</i>

473
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:17,372
<i>Go on, there's the door.</i>

474
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,741
<i>You can do better?</i>
<i>Let's see how far you get.</i>

475
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:28,516
No takers? Fine.
But get one thing straight...

476
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,454
you're staying.

477
00:41:33,456 --> 00:41:35,956
This isn't a democracy anymore.
