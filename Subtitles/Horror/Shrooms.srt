5
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,440
Someone's got it bad.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
No, l don't.

7
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,400
lt was just a summer thing.

8
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,200
So why are you travelling
5000 miles to see him?

9
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,880
lt's not to see him.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,880
l'm here just like
the rest of you, you know,
see Ireland, do shrooms.

11
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,720
Tara, l've known you
all my life and l've never
even seen you take an aspirin.

12
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,000
People change.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
When your dad hears
you've changed this much,

14
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,600
he's gonna ground you 
until you marry a 
nice Catholic boy.

16
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,840
Yeah, well, maybe he can't
tell me what to do here.

20
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,040
You know, l've never
done shrooms before.

21
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,040
lt's not gonna fuck me up?

22
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,920
You can't fuck up
what's already fucked.

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,200
Seriously, dude?

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,640
No, nobody's ever died
from taking shrooms before.

25
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,920
l mean, they're all natural.

26
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,160
Besides, just imagine
what steroids
have done to you.

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
Be nice.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,000
Bet she doesn't even trim.

29
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,200
Lisa.

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
Shoot.

31
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,960
The element of surprise.

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,920
Where's martial arts training
there, Bruce Lee?

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
A momentary distraction
caused by sinful thoughts.

34
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,600
Mm-hm.
Mm.

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,440
l know what distraction.

36
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,840
Well, l got my ''hi-ya.''

37
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,360
Well, l got mine.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,760
Death.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,360
And coma. Pah!

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Any sign of that vagabond
boyfriend of yours?

41
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,160
He's not my boyfriend.

42
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,560
Yet.

44
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,560
Are you sure you don't
mind us tagging along?

45
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,800
No. Jake and Troy
have been planning this forever.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,240
So where is he, then?

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,240
Maybe his horse and cart
broke down.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
Troy, you were in college too.
How many classes

49
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,960
do you remember him
being on time for?

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,560
One. That's chemistry.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
Dude, you need your ride pimped.

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,840
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, what's up, brother?

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
Man, you made it.
It's good to see you.

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
lt's good to see you, dude.
Hey.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
_

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,160
Hi.
Hi, Lisa.

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,800
Hey, honey.

58
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,920
So céad míle fáilte,
you Yankee junkie motherfuckers.

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,320
MAN:
The worst of the bad weather
has now passed.

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,920
So the story is
l promised you gringos
the trip of a lifetime.

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,000
A shroom trip has to be outdoors,

63
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,200
at one with nature, the right
environment with the right people.

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,120
Then the trip's real smooth.

65
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,360
No one has the same trip.

66
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,560
You know, some people
get spooked, some freak out.

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
So don't fight it.

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
You have to get into the trip
to get out of it.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
So this is a ''fuck it''?
Yeah.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,360
Well, in America
we have bongs.

71
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,480
Maybe so.
Do you have something
that's called a ''fuck it''?

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,560
What the fuck are you talking about?
l don't know, but, hey, fuck it.

73
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,480
Anyway, for our chosen mushrooms,

74
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,800
we'll be concentrating
on the liberty cap,

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
a.k.a. the magic mushroom,

76
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,680
which has been known
to give boundless energy,

77
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,440
visual hallucinations,

78
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,640
uncontrollable laughter
and profound wisdom.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,760
Look at this.
We got Carlos Castaneda
sitting in the front seat.

81
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,160
Who?
How can you tell

82
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,520
they're the right ones?
Yeah.

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
They can be identified
by the little nipples on the caps.

84
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,480
And nothing that looks like
a dick with balls, Bluto.

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Wait. So how do we take them?
We brew the shrooms into a tea.

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,760
l don't drink tea.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,200
This really looks like a wiener.

88
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,200
When in Rome...

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,160
Are you sure this is a good time
to go looking for mushrooms?

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,960
No better. We'll have
the whole park to ourselves.

92
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,480
Sure looks quiet out there.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Welcome to Ireland.

94
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,160
Do you guys have dogging
in America?

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,440
What's that?

96
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,200
Finally we get something
before you do.

97
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,840
What?

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
We've got
a notorious dogging scene up here.

99
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,960
Okay, what is it?

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,560
Well, couples go to remote country
areas and make out in their car

101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
and people come and watch them.

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,960
And the couple
flashes the light
in the car three times.

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,680
That's the signal for the dogger
to come and join in.

104
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,880
He drops trou,
out comes the doodah.

105
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,240
They wind down the window,
he slips it in.

106
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,040
The girl gives him
a happy ending.

107
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,720
Cool.
That's vile.

108
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,560
We went
to convent school, remember?

109
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,400
l'm there.

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
l'm ioshing.

112
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,960
Fuck!
Yeah, fuck.

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,120
That's blood.
Come on, let's get out.

114
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,120
Tara, it wasn't your fault.

115
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,960
Jesus.
Oh, my gosh.

116
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,080
No, l can't see any dents.

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,880
Did you see it?
Did you see it get out?

118
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,720
Wait. Shh.

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
What is it?

120
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,240
What is it?
It's a fucking goat.

121
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,440
Be careful.
Oh, my God.

122
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,320
lt's still alive.

123
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,040
Jesus Christ.

124
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,640
Oh, the poor thing.

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
Maybe we should take it to a vet
and have it humanely destroyed.

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
Fuck!
What the fuck are you doing?

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,400
That humane enough for you?

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
You are evil.

130
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,360
How would you like
that done to you?

131
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,960
You guys, at least
it's out of its misery.

134
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,000
What do they want?

135
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,640
That's their dinner.

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,760
Oh, my God.

138
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,360
What is this,
The IsIand of Dr. Moreau?

139
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,720
l think that's what we call
the indigenous people.

140
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,800
Cracker motherfuckers!
Shut up.

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,880
Shut the fuck up.
Jesus.

142
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,040
What?

144
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,160
Right, then, first things first.
Rule number one, no mobile phones.

145
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
Wait.
What?

146
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,280
Guys, we're about to trip.

147
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
On trips, you hallucinate.

148
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,720
When you hallucinate,
you call mum

149
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,640
_

150
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,520
Or you end up calling the police
or the ambulance, you know?

151
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,400
Look, in terms
of unnecessary embarrassment,

152
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,080
you don't want access to a phone.

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
Besides, it upsets nature.

154
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,760
Right.

155
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,480
Thank you.

156
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,040
l'm lost without my cell.

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,320
That's why we're here, mate.

158
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,400
Man, that's like
handing over my freedom.

159
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,360
You can be sheriff, then.

160
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,640
Good man.

161
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,120
Shit.

162
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
No tampons.

163
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,640
Wrong.

164
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,400
Thanks, Mom.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't worry,
l didn't forget about you. Candy.

166
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,320
The way of the tiger
perfects the sixth sense.

167
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
l will strike every item
before it hits the ground.

168
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,400
Okay, l wasn't ready.

169
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,880
So, Holly, you and Troy?

170
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,160
What?

171
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,400
Don't you get freaked out
by all that tiger stuff?

172
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,000
No. No, it's different.

173
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,360
lt's part of his martial art.

174
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,560
Yeah. l need more.

175
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,480
_

176
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,680
Yee-ha. Mm.

177
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,240
Yeah, well
other thin\code(01f5)s work
like that too.

178
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,280
Hey, nice girls need
to get laid too.
That's all l'm saying.

179
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,360
How does that feel?

180
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,200
Nice and tight.

181
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
And speaking of tight.

182
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,360
Bluto, stop.

183
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,440
Jesus, Lisa.
Not here.

184
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,720
All right already with the guidebook.

185
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,880
We're here to live life,
not to read about it.

186
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,680
When my mom left,
l was terrified

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,600
my dad was gonna send me
to a place like that.

188
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,280
l don't know.
These guys seem like a lot of fun.

189
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,280
He's ignoring me.

190
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Tara.
l shouldn't have come.

191
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,880
You are here with Bluto,
Troy is here with Holly.

192
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,520
This is embarrassing.

193
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,440
We iust got here. Just chill out.

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,680
For once in your life, let go.

195
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,280
Just take some shrooms
and have fun.

196
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,880
Then we'll see
what happens with Jake.

197
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,440
You think?

198
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,320
l know.

199
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay, l'm in.

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,680
Good. Here.

202
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,720
You find them in little clusters.

203
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:52,200
They can be identified
by the little nipples on their caps.

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,960
How do you know
so much about this stuff?

205
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,160
When l was first sent
to boarding school in England,

206
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
l used to get the shit kicked out of me
most nights.

207
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,480
But this kind of stuff, they think
you're cool and you get left alone.

208
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,960
Fuck. They must be in season.

209
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,440
Are they dangerous?

210
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,960
Yeah, like nuclear dangerous.

211
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,920
_

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,760
these are the dreaded
death's head fungi.

213
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,520
They only grow once
every several seasons.

214
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,120
But they look just like
the other ones.

215
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,040
Yeah, they're not.
So, what if we ate them?

216
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,520
Basically, your heart
explodes, along with
your lungs and kidneys.

217
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,960
What are the properties?

218
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,320
lf you live?

219
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,680
Yeah, if you live.

220
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,200
Well, according
to the ancient Irish Druids,

221
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,680
they believed it was like
a portal to another dimension.

222
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,160
They gave the ability
to commune with the dead,

223
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,800
uncontrollable ferocity,

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,040
shape-shifting,
and last but not least, foresight.

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
The gift of premonition.

226
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's go.
We'd better warn the others.

227
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,800
Bluto.

228
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,960
No. Bluto.

229
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
You've got a girlfriend
and l've got Troy, remember?

230
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,120
Come on, Holly.

231
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,120
Just having a little bit
of fun, okay? Lisa's being
all stingy with me.

232
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,680
No, it's not fun
to cheat on your girlfriend.

234
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,240
Yeah, it is.

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
Wait. What was that?

237
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
lt's nothing.

238
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,520
l don't like it here, okay?
Let's go find the others.

239
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,520
l was totally kidding.
l wouldn't hook up with you.

241
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Tara!

242
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,520
What were you doing
far from the madding crowd?

243
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,480
Tara?

245
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,880
Tara?

247
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
Tara?

248
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,840
Tara, Tara, look at me, Tara.

249
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,280
Fucking hell. Tara!

250
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Calm down, it's okay. Shit.

251
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,680
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

252
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,200
Guys!

253
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
Troy!

255
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,040
Oh, Jesus.

256
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,600
Fucking hell.

257
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,840
Look at me.
Fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

258
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,880
No, l didn't.
Fuck. You okay?

259
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,680
What were you doing?
Far from the madding crowd.

260
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,840
l knew you were gonna come.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What?
l saw it.

262
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,560
Tara, these are lethal.
You could have died.

263
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,040
l saw you.

264
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,160
l saw it.

265
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,080
You need to
take it easy for a bit.

266
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,280
You survived,
but they're in your system now.

267
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,400
You don't believe me.
Sure l do.

268
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,040
Try to stand up.

269
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
_

270
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,520
Fucking hell.

271
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,800
l can see things.
The future is--

272
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,920
You need to drink a lot of water.

273
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,160
l knew he was gonna save me.
Lots of water.

274
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,160
Drink.

275
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:19,080
But you don't understand.
l saw him.

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,920
He kissed me. And l knew.

277
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,480
l saw it before.

278
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,880
Sleep.

279
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,240
You'll feel much better
when you wake up.

280
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,760
l iust knew before...

282
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,480
Hey, baby.

283
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,480
l heard you guys
had a moment.

284
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,480
She already likes you.
Now you save her life too.

285
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,640
Look, you know
l don't wanna hurt her.

286
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
You hurt her, and l will kill you.

287
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:12,680
_

288
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,400
Tomorrow, guys, we trip hard.

289
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,120
Right.
Woo-hoo!

290
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,840
So tell us a ghost story.

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
Yeah, Jake,
tell us about the banshee.

292
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,760
Oh, great idea.
Yeah.

293
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,080
Or the evil leprechauns.

294
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,400
_

295
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,560
lt is so scary. Not.

296
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
Look, banshees, leprechauns,

297
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
_

298
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,120
You know, it's just
another tourist trap.
No such thing.

299
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,040
There's only one
scary story in the world,
and you know what that is?

300
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,760
The true story, right?

301
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,080
Because if it's true,
you know it can
happen to you, right?

302
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,520
So you know where this is going.

303
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
What?

306
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,200
Go on.

307
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,480
Well, there's an
abandoned house up here,

308
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,400
apparently not too far
from where we are now.

309
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,280
lt used to be a young
offenders' centre
called Glengarriff.

310
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,040
lt was owned by
this religious order, kind of
like the Christian Brothers.

311
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,360
They were known
as the Black Knights
of Colmcille.

312
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,840
_

313
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,120
nothing Christian about them.

314
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,840
Most of them ended up here
after doing all the missions.

315
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,360
All the hot spots: Sierra Leone,
Liberia, the inner Congo, Rwanda.

316
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,720
And God knows
what sights they'd seen,

317
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,480
living amongst mass murderers
and cannibals, what have you.

318
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,080
No. Stop.

319
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,520
This is just...
Baby, baby, l'll protect you. It's cool.

320
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,000
Fine.
Go on.

321
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,240
Now, terrible things went on
in the house if you didn't
abide by their rules.

322
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,520
l mean, they treated the kids
like dogs, literally.

323
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,280
lf a kid was bold,
it wasn't milk and cookies.

324
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,880
lt was banished to the kennels
to live with the guard dogs.

326
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,480
Well, legend had it
there was this one Black Brother

327
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,800
who was
a complete fucking sadist.

328
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,680
He put a 3-inch steel blade
into an old Irish fighting stick

329
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,120
and he beat the kids with it.

330
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,640
He'd take the worst
young offenders
to the storeroom.

331
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,200
And he'd hang them,
claim they committed suicide.

332
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,400
You know, maim others,

333
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,000
cut out the tongue
of anyone that dared defy him.

334
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,400
Until this one day...

335
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,600
Well, there were
these two young offenders, twins.

336
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,160
You know,
they were difficult boys, but close.

337
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,360
They were caught
throwing stones at the church.

338
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,120
Well, the Black Brother
scalded one's face

339
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,600
and made him wear a sack
over his head to hide the burns.

340
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,480
He then proceeded
to hang his twin

341
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,400
and forced him
to watch his brother swing.

342
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,520
He christened him
the Lonely Twin.

343
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,760
Now, this kid,
after everything he'd seen,

344
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,240
he had nothing
but hate and anger inside of him.

345
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
He swore he'd have his revenge.

347
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,160
So he went out and
he picked three pounds
of death's head shrooms,

348
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,120
and he put them
into the Black Brother's
soup bowl.

349
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,120
Little did he know.

350
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,840
Well, think about it.

351
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,120
All that sexual repression,

352
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,920
all that good old Catholic guilt
and violence unleashed.

354
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,680
And what?
Yeah, come on, spit it out.

355
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,640
And 78 people
were massacred that night.

356
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,120
Butchered beyond belief.

357
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,160
#

358
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
Two bodies
were never accounted for.

359
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,520
The Black Brother
and the Lonely Twin.

360
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,440
They're said to haunt the woods
round here.

361
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,560
Jesus Christ, enough.

362
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,120
l wouldn't blaspheme
if l were you.

363
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,080
They took great offence to that.
Stop fucking with her, man.

364
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah, and l don't
wanna have nightmares.

365
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,760
No, seriously,
strange things happen up here
around shroom season.

366
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,320
You know, reports of mysterious
figures lurking in the woods,

367
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,120
people getting hit
by stones that seem
to fly out of nowhere.

368
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,200
Some have even gone
missing only for their bodies
to turn up mutilated,

369
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,320
but always have
one thing in common.

370
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,760
The injuries have been inflicted
by a 3-inch steel blade.

371
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,320
l don't like this story.

372
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,520
She's right, okay? Shut up.

373
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,200
That's...

375
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,600
Okay.

376
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,600
Great. Thanks for
the heart attack
in my sleep.

377
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,840
Yeah, thanks, Jake.

378
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,960
So l guess that concludes
the story, right?

379
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,000
_

380
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
Good night, Tara.

381
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,040
l don't care.

382
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
Good night, guys.

383
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,720
Baby, we're not
supposed to until tomorrow.

384
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,880
l know, but it's
supposed to heighten
the sexual experience tenfold.

385
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
Hm. Mm.

387
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,080
lnteresting.

388
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,640
Shit.

389
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,240
What? What?

390
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,520
There's someone there.

391
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,920
Oh, baby, there's nobody there.

392
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,560
lt's the shrooms.

393
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,680
No, there was.

395
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,200
That motherfucker!

396
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,560
No, Troy, don't go out there.

397
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,160
Bluto, get the fuck out here!

398
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,840
You peeping Tom
motherfucker. l know you were
outside my tent, man.

399
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,880
No, but you're outside mine.

400
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,760
Do you see the steroids,
you fucking testosterone head?

401
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,520
Look what they do to you.
You're pathetic.

402
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,960
_

403
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,560
You're gonna get hurt.
No, no, no. It's okay.

404
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,960
l know martial arts. It's okay.

405
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,160
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

406
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,360
Shit. Sorry.

407
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,560
You broke my fucking nose.
Fuck you! Fuck!

408
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,040
Troy, are you okay?
You don't hit people in the face.

409
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,520
_

410
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,440
What, you think he wanted
a peek at your hairy stash?

411
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,360
You know what, bitch?
At least my tits are real.

412
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,680
You wanna play like that,
Chewbacca? Because
l will rip that hair right off you.

413
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,960
Guys, chill out, really.

414
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,200
Well, there was someone there.

415
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,760
lt was me.

416
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,840
l needed to take a piss.
l walked past your tent.

417
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
That's bullshit.

418
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,880
_

419
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,920
lt's late. Everyone's tired.

420
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,880
Come on, lads, make up.

421
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,720
Fuck you.
Eat me.

422
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,360
Get away from me.

423
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,720
Listen, Lisa, it wasn't me.

424
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,360
Oh, yeah?
Well, who else was it, then?

425
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,720
Come on, are you serious?

426
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,360
l'm so sick of this.

427
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,160
Our bickering,
the mood swings when you
go on those stupid steroids

428
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,520
and the fights
and your pimply ass.

429
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,320
And most of all
your perverted 'behaviour.

430
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,280
Okay. We'll start doing it
from the front.

431
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,800
Are you leaving or am l?

432
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,880
Fuck!

433
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,480
You know,
you're not so hot yourself.

434
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,520
What?
You fart in your sleep.

435
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,200
No, l don't.

437
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,120
Asshole.

438
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,040
Douchebag.

439
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,800
Tara?

440
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
You okay?

441
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,440
Yeah.

442
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,640
Drowsy, like l got a concussion.

443
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
l knew something bad
was gonna happen.

444
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,520
Those death's head
shrooms are big juju.

445
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,040
You just need
to get some rest.

446
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,480
l knew he was gonna get hurt.

447
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,720
You took the blame.

448
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,720
Yeah, anything for a quiet life.

449
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,760
You were here the whole time.

450
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah, l know.

451
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,000
l think people got a little freaked
from the ghost story.

452
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,560
_

453
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,800
lt was iust a story.

454
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,040
Can't kid a kidder.

456
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
The death's head fungi.
The death's head fungi.

457
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,880
The gift of premonition.

458
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,320
l knew you were gonna come.

459
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,560
lt's an abandoned house.

460
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,840
Strange things go on up here
around shroom season.

461
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,040
PeopIe going missing.

462
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,560
Never accounted for.

463
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,400
It's said they're meant
to haunt the woods around here.

464
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,520
_t was just a story.

465
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,160
_t was just a story.

467
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,200
Holy shit.

468
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,200
Fuck.

469
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,920
Bluto.

471
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,120
Hey, come back.

472
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,320
Hello?

473
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
Well, well, well.

475
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,360
You can talk.

476
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,000
That's because
you're out of your mind.

477
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,520
You see a girl?

478
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,160
She went thataway.

479
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,840
Thanks.
Wouldn't do that if l were you.

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
Why not?

481
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,840
You know you're fucked.

482
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,480
Yes, l know.

483
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,280
l mean, dead fucked.

484
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,840
Yeah, but you're iust a fucking cow.

485
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,680
A fucking cow
that can fucking talk.

486
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,520
l gotta go.
Yeah.

487
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Bye-bye.

490
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,520
Where you at, bitch?

491
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Hello? Hello?

492
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,720
Ooh! Doggers.

493
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,040
Hey, hey, hey!

494
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
Let me in, let me in. Come on!

495
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,240
Give me some.

496
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,480
Okay.

497
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,760
No. You need more than that
for what l got, baby.

498
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,640
See that?

499
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,840
Yeah, that's what
l'm talking about. Oh, yeah.

500
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,760
Oh, my God. Yeah.

501
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Yeah, baby girl.

502
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Oh, it's so soft and wet.

506
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
What the fuck?

507
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,320
Hey.

508
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,880
Hey.

509
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,800
Who's there?

513
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,400
l'm sorry.

516
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
Bluto?

517
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,920
Bluto!

518
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,840
Bluto!

519
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,320
Bluto!

521
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,680
You can talk.

522
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,760
Yeah, but you're just
a fucking cow.

523
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,160
Bluto.

524
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,080
We need to get back.

525
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,880
Where?
To Lisa.

526
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,600
Yeah. To Lisa.

527
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,360
You're tripping.
It's not safe.

528
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,680
Cows can't talk.

529
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,600
No, cows can't talk.

530
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,240
Relax.

531
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,840
Yeah.

532
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:38,640
Relax.
No.

533
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,840
You relax. Now sleep.

534
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,560
l want his balls in a sling.

535
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
Bluto!

536
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,800
He must have snuck out again.

537
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,040
That freak was talking to a cow?

538
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,640
He was tripping out of his mind.

539
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,080
He's so dead.

540
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,600
Hey, asshole,
this isn't funny.

541
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,840
He's out of it.
He's playing games.

542
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,240
Look, l know you're pissed, okay?

543
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
But we gotta find him.

544
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,200
Let him come down.

545
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Then you can kick his ass.

546
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,560
Fine.

547
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,560
Bluto!

548
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,120
Bluto!
Sh h ! Listen .

550
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,280
That's probably the guys.
Let's go back.

551
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,720
l don't wanna miss out
on the fun.

552
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,760
Yes.

553
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,560
You were right, bro.
These shrooms, they're incredible.

554
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,320
ls Bluto back?

555
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,840
No, we thought he was with you.

556
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,840
You want some breakfast?

557
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,760
A liquid, visual breakfast.

558
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,800
l can't believe
you guys started without us.

559
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,080
l wanna find him.

560
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,280
l had a dream.
Something bad happened to him.

561
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,200
lt was iust a dream.

562
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,400
Or a trip.

563
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,960
Something really shitty
could have happened to Bluto.

564
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,160
Well, shit happens.

565
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,840
Honey, iust find your neutral space.

566
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,600
l mean, Bluto's not
in anyone's good books today.

567
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,080
He took most of the shrooms.

568
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,640
Look what he did to my hair.

569
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
l think it suits you.

570
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,360
Oh, do you?
Yeah.

571
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,880
Do you think it suits me, do you?
Yeah.

573
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,360
Give me some of that.

574
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,720
Lisa, what are you doing?

575
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,600
There's nothing else to do.

576
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,000
Fuck him, girl.
He's an asshole.

577
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,080
Oh, this is great.

578
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,640
l'd accounted for six people.

579
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,640
So it's my conclusion Bluto's having
force 1 O visual hallucinations.

580
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,120
l don't think
he's emotionally equipped for that.

581
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,480
Look at these.
Jesus, it gets better.

582
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,080
Will you listen to me now?

583
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,680
We've got the cell phones in the car.
We could call somebody.

584
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,080
He took the phones.

585
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,280
What a dickface.

586
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,640
What if there's
an emergency?

587
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,760
Guess we're fucked.

588
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,440
Bluto!

589
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,840
Bluto!

590
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,400
Man, l'm so domed.

591
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,160
These fucking bugs, man,
they're like a halo of piranhas.

592
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,040
There you go, man.

593
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,480
lt's iust your sensory perception.

594
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,680
Where did you learn
so much about shrooms?

595
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,280
You know how l was sent away
to boarding school in England?

596
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,480
Yeah.

597
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,640
Well, they used to bully me
pretty badly there.

598
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,000
_

599
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,760
This is what you get
with the self-defence.

600
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,600
You get a martial art.

601
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,760
What about Bluto last night?

602
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,760
lt takes time to perfect.

603
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,640
You see, it's a lot...

604
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,760
lt's the way of the tiger.

606
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,520
Like the eye of the tiger?

607
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,200
My art is a discipline.

608
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,080
And that's what l'm trained to do.
l'm trained to be disciplined.

609
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:32,360
Now, if l abuse the forms
and the methods that l know

610
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,000
for every petty argument
or stupid-ass fight,

611
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:38,640
Jake, people could die.

612
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,800
What, you don't believe me?

614
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,960
Baby, are you okay?

615
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,080
Holly, it takes time
to perfect this.

616
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,720
Yeah, right.

617
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,040
Guys, stop fucking around.

618
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:08,440
Tara, chill out.

619
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,600
Girl is serious, man.

620
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,160
So you know it wasn't me
outside your tent last night?

621
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,960
_

622
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,720
l don't think
it was Bluto either, though.

623
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,000
l mean, he's a prick,

624
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,600
but l feel like if he did
something like that, you know,

625
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
he would have
bragged about it.

626
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,360
Well, if it wasn't me
and it wasn't him, who was it?

627
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,560
That's the question, isn't it?

628
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,520
You know, it's probably
those inbred goat herders
from yesterday.

629
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,680
Yeah.

630
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,200
Bluto!

631
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,600
We're walking in circles.

632
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,160
_

633
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,840
_

634
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,840
l don't know.

635
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,520
Oh, sugar.

636
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,400
Wrong shoes.

637
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,640
Shut up.

638
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,120
Bluto!

639
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,320
Bluto!

641
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,440
There's somebody there.

642
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,640
Hello?

643
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,360
Where?
l don't see anything.

644
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,520
They're right
over there. Hello?

645
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,480
lt's coming. It's coming.

646
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,920
lt's coming! Run!

647
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,160
Let's go, let's go.
What?

648
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,560
What is it? What did you see?

649
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,480
Tara!

650
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,240
What did you see?

651
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Are we tripping that hard?

652
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,360
l don't know.

653
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,000
Don't tell me it's some crazy
backwoodsman or something, Tara.

654
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,280
lt wasn't.

655
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What, you know? Who is it?

656
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,480
l'm not sure,

657
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,680
but he was in all black.

658
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,160
And he was from the dream l had.

659
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,720
ln a dream?

660
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,640
You have us
nearly having cardiacs

661
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,400
because of something
you saw in a dream?

662
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,240
That killed Bluto.

663
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,480
Tara, that's fucked up.

664
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,080
We need to get out of here.

665
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,160
l wish l hadn't taken those shrooms.

666
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,160
Tara.

667
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,480
You asked, Lisa.

668
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,080
You said he was dead.
In the dream.

669
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,440
You're freaking me out.

670
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,880
Look, l overdosed
on the heroin of shrooms.

671
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,080
l don't know
what's going on in my head.

672
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,520
What's real and what's not.

673
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,280
But l'm seeing things
before they happen.

674
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,200
What do you mean?

675
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,920
l want this to stop.

676
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,960
_

677
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,720
_

678
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,360
because Bluto stole
our fucking cell phones!

679
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,320
You see this frog cum?

680
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,200
This is trippy as shit, man.

681
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,360
Tara.

682
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,520
You're gonna need a sniffer dog
to find anybody out here, man.

683
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,520
They have to be close.

684
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,800
Bluto!

685
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,560
You hear that?
Yeah.

686
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,160
Bluto.

687
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,120
My feet are killing me.

688
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,920
Dolce & Gabbana
are hardly adequate
outdoor footwear.

689
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,960
Well, maybe if you took
better care of yourself,

690
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,840
your boyfriend wouldn't
have to check me out
every time you turn your back.

692
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:34,040
You guys can't fight, please.

694
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,520
Help me out of here, you guys.

696
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,960
lt's Bluto!

697
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,080
Oh, my God. It's Bluto!

699
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,720
Calm down, calm down!

700
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,920
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

701
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,200
Oh, my God.
Calm down.

702
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,840
Oh, my God.
Calm down, calm down!

703
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,200
Shh. Shh, shh.

704
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,640
This isn't happening.

705
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,120
This isn't happening.

706
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,160
This is just a trip.
Yeah.

707
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,400
This is iust a trip.

708
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:32,280
We can't all
be having the same trip.

710
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:41,440
What?

711
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:44,960
Something is moving out there.

712
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:46,840
No.

713
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,000
Stay.

714
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:00,240
lt might be Jake and Troy.
Stay here.

715
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,080
Be quiet.

718
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,000
Run! Get up!

719
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:54,520
Run!

720
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,080
No, Holly, don't split up.

721
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,760
l iust wanna be your friend.

722
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,960
If a kid was bold
it was banished to the kennels--

724
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,680
Hello?

725
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,760
ls anybody there?

726
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Could you please help me?

727
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,320
Someone's trying to kill me.

728
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:52,000
You'd better come in, so...

729
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,440
Do you have a phone?

730
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:17,080
We do, aye.

731
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,600
Fine chassis.

732
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,000
Bodywork is all there, Ernie.
Will you ever give over?

733
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:27,920
He's not right in the head, sweetheart.

734
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,200
Phone is there.

735
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,360
Room in the boot too l'd say, Ernie.

736
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,040
Fucking bananas, that man.

737
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,640
lt doesn't work.

738
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,840
You asked
did we have a phone.

739
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,560
You never asked
did it work.

740
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,040
Caught her there, Ernie.

741
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:04,560
So is there no contact?

742
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:07,080
There's a tractor.

743
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,360
Didn't he go and fuck the gearbox
in her and all?

744
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:16,520
Please, l've taken stuff.

745
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:19,120
Someone's trying to kill me.

746
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,240
Hon, never worry about that.

747
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,240
We've taken stuff too.
Look around you.

748
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,480
The mushies.

749
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,960
Powerful gear.

750
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,080
Keeps you young.
Fills the bag.

751
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,640
Taking them now
since we were
at the bad boys' home.

752
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,520
You were at that home?
Aye.

753
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:47,800
We were wild cubs,
SO We Were.

754
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,920
Ma used to have to lock us up
with the pigs.

755
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,720
Until this fella here
started interfering with them.

756
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,560
Not me.

757
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:08,680
The only weakness
l would have now
is for a bull calf tied to a gate.

758
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,360
Lovely tongue on a bull calf.

759
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:15,600
Like sandpaper.

760
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,200
Say, she have
a nice tongue, Ernie.

761
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,920
A man all in black.

762
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,600
That be the Black Brother.

763
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,880
But he's not real.
But it's happening.

764
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,760
_

765
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,880
Could be worse.
Could be that fuckwit of a twin.

766
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:42,280
Or it could be--
Bernie.

767
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,560
Keep your powder dry, boy.

768
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,880
Do you have a bathroom?

769
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,840
Yeah.

770
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,440
ln back there.

771
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,640
Get back.

772
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,520
You bad dog!

774
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,960
Get me an axe.

775
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,640
Get down.

776
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,240
Not yet.
Get down.

One survivor was found.

00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,960
This feraI kid

Holly, Holly!

788
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,560

So you and Tara, man.
You balling her?

792
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,720
No, man. She's a sweetheart.

793
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,320
Well, she was so pissed
when she found

794
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,960
all five of us
were gonna make
this trip out here.

795
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,200
_

796
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,920
Dude, seriously,
you're making me paranoid.

797
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:16,400
Come on,
she wants your nuts.

798
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:23,640
Troy.

799
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,960
That's Holly.
No, it sounded like Tara.

802
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,800
Troy.

803
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,280
Jake.

804
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:00,920
Seriously, guys,
this is not funny.

805
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:03,320
Seriously, guys,
this is not funny.

806
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,200
This is a trip, man, right?
This is a trip.

807
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,480
This is what happens?
Yeah, let's go, fuck this.

808
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,840
_

809
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:25,160
Ah!
Troy.

810
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:29,880
Let's go. Come on.

811
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,040
_

812
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,880
Oh, my God.

813
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:57,360
Did you find Holly?
No.

814
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:58,840
But l found this.

815
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,480
Oh, my God.

816
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,120
There's something out there.
There's something evil.

817
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,680
l think Jake's stories are real.
This can't be happening.

818
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,120
What about Bluto?

819
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,400
Lisa, we have to find her.

820
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,120
Tara.

821
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,560
Jake.
Go to the house.

822
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,440
No, wait for us.

823
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,840
There's a road near there.
We can get help from there.

824
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,120
We have to find Holly.

825
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,920
l can't hear you.
Meet us at the house.

826
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,440
Okay, we gotta go.

827
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,760
We can't leave Holly.

828
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,400
l've got a feeling--
This feeling has us in shit creek.

829
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,960
Lisa, it's true.
She's around here,
l can feel it.

830
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,520
Okay, if it's the truth,

831
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:11,840

832
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,920
See? You didn't see that coming.

835
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,760
Oh, my God. Tara?

Tara!

838
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,280
Where's he gone?

839
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,680
Holly, you wouldn't
want to rile him,
now he has your scent.

840
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,320
You shouldn't have let
him loose. Easy now.

843
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,080
Are you okay?

844
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:23,520
You were at that school.

You scared the shit

01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,400
Look over there, in the water.
