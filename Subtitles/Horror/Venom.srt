00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:45,904
- Yeah. I'm gonna pee.
- You're using a dead man's toilet.

325
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:49,109
Oh, I promise to flush and be polite.

326
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:06,869
Hey, Tammy. If you wanted somewhere
to break in and enter, now's your chance.

327
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:11,064
- Will you hurry? We're gonna hit traffic.
- Shut up.

328
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,146
Oh.

329
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:40,569
<i>- Ugh!
- (flies buzzing)</i>

330
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:47,738
Patty.

331
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:52,473
Patty, come on.
The mall closes at eight.

00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,947
Patty. Come on, dude.

00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,528
Hey-hey!

335
00:30:37,186 --> 00:30:39,488
Patty!

336
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:43,421
Patty?

Patty!

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,154
Patty!

What the fuck?

341
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,945
Patty?

- More beer!
- You're gonna have to work for it.

00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:52,870
- You're drunk.
- You're drunk? You didn't have anything.

362
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:55,084
<i>No, you're drunk.</i>

363
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,703
I don't know, Eden.

364
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,544
<i>(Eden) I know it doesn't make sense,
but something really weird is going on.</i>

365
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:07,214
You saw it yourself. When Cece found out
Ray was killed by snakes, she flipped out.

366
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:09,486
Her grandmother just died, Eden.

367
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:12,718
She was upset.
We're all upset.

368
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:14,892
I think I'm gonna go check up on her.

369
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:17,963
My mom says that Miss Emmie
lived out at the end of Fuller Road,

370
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:19,661
and she's there all by herself.

371
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:24,653
Hey, you know, I don't want you to get
all worked up about this voodoo shit.

372
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:28,499
It's not real.
It's just Louisiana folklore.

373
00:34:28,564 --> 00:34:30,091
Yeah, I know.

374
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:31,920
Hey.

375
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,956
Are we still fighting?

376
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:41,521
<i>- (Sean) Are you fucking kidding me?
- I swear to God I am not making this up.</i>

377
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:45,135
- You guys, what's going on?
- The town is upside down.

378
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:48,435
Deputy Turner and Terry Parker
who works at the morgue are missing.

379
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:52,909
And here's the really fucked-up part.
So is Ray Sawyer.

380
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:56,911
- Ray's dead, Ricky.
- Yeah. That's the really fucked-up part.

381
00:34:56,982 --> 00:34:58,924
His body's missing.

382
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,200
What the fuck
are you all looking at me for?

383
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,711
- Fuck this.
- Sean, where are you going? Sean! Sean!

384
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:14,670
- I'm gonna go check on Cece.
- Eric, stop him. He's drunk.

What are you doing, man?
You can't drive like this.

388
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,339
He's not gonna go away.
He'll never fucking go away.

389
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:30,416
Get off the bike and we'll talk about it.

390
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:32,877
Oh, fuck this.

391
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:34,993
Drunk fucker.

392
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,499
This is where Cece lives?

393
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:18,071
No, her grandmother does.
Come on, I think it's this way.

394
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,258
<i>(tinkling)</i>

395
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:35,094

<i>(Rachel) All this voodoo shit
weirds me out.</i>

399
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,637
Cece?

400
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:14,876
Just go in.

401
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,717
<i>- (Eden) What?
- (Rachel) What is that?</i>

402
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:22,614
<i>- (Eden) I don't know.
- (Rachel) I don't like it.</i>

403
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:33,311
Cece?

404
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:42,529
<i>(Rachel) I don't think she's here.</i>

405
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,766
Check this out.

406
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:53,468
<i>- (Rachel) What's it supposed to be?
- (Ricky) I don't know.</i>

407
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,125
It's a milking ceremony.

408
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,682
It's an old Haitian ritual.

409
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:04,003
The mambo's saving the man's soul,
cleansing him of his evil.

410
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:06,364
It's his last rites.

411
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:09,753
The snakes
are charmed by the mambo.

412
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,131
They suck out the man's evil...

413
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,524
so that his soul may pass on.

414
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:23,355
What are you guys doing here?

415
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,667
We need to talk.

416
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,385
<i>(clattering)</i>

00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:55,647
<i>(Sean) Guess
this is all mine now, huh?</i>

418
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,215
You know what I'm gonna do?

419
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:00,901
I've been thinking about this.
I think I'm gonna repaint this place.

420
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,660
Yeah, spruce it up a bit.

421
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:06,045
Bring the business back
to the Happy Time gas station.

422
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:10,115
What do you think, like a light blue,
maybe? A sunny yellow, perhaps?

423
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:12,706
Something real happy, right?

424
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:15,233
Come on, Sean.
I'll take you home.

425
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:16,899
So how do I look?

426
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,905
Do I look like
I'm gonna be a good gas pumper, huh?

427
00:39:20,554 --> 00:39:24,264
'Course, I'm gonna have to get myself
a tattoo, right? And a big scar.

428
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:28,008
'Cause if I'm gonna be the new town freak,
I gotta do it all the way, correct?

<i>(bell rings)</i>

430
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,925
<i>- Hear that?
- (bell rings)</i>

431
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:37,765
So what do you think, man?

432
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:41,578
Do you think I got what it takes? Huh?
Do I got what it takes?

433
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:44,295
Are people gonna come through here
and ring my bell?

434
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:47,713
Huh? Are they gonna ring my bell?
You think they'll come through?

435
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:50,658
- Don't do this, man.
- Don't do what?

436
00:39:50,732 --> 00:39:54,694
Yeah, don't worry, Dad.
I'll make you real fucking proud.

437
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:59,211
Sean! Sean, come on, man!

438
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:03,146
Sean, stop it!

439
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:08,807
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on.

440
00:40:27,215 --> 00:40:29,288
<i>(Sean) Oh, shit!</i>

441
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:33,927
<i>(coughs/vomits)</i>

442
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:02,385
This is some weird shit.

443
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,622
I don't like it.

444
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:17,162
When did Ray's body go missing?

445
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:22,669
I don't know, but I think I saw
his truck this morning at the cemetery.

446
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:32,651
Who else is missing?

447
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:34,929
Terry who works at the morgue...

448
00:41:34,997 --> 00:41:37,866
and Deputy Turner.

449
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,242
What's going on, Cece?

450
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:54,477
It's a voodoo temple.

451
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,806
Grandma was a mambo,
like her mother before her.

452
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,477
It's in our blood, Eden.

453
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:12,209
For generations,
people would come here to worship.

454
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,727
It's a religion, like any other.

455
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,149
It's full of spirits - both good and evil.

456
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:24,369
They're called loas.

457
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,660
Grandma helped a lot of people here.

458
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:30,703
She was a good woman.

459
00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:34,840
Your grandmother was wearing this.

460
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:39,983
It's a baka.

461
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:42,995
It's a charm that protects against evil.

462
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,277
What was she doing
out so late last night?

463
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:54,293
You know over in Cypress,
where they're building that new mill?

464
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,429
There's an old Creole burial ground there.

465
00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:00,728
She was afraid of what
someone might find if they started digging.

466
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,934
The suitcase?

467
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,609
Grandma saved souls.

468
00:43:09,596 --> 00:43:12,051
Murderers,

469
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:14,580
sadists,

470
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:16,888
the most vile men.

471
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:21,048
She milked them of evil.

472
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,772
What was in that suitcase, Cece?

473
00:43:23,837 --> 00:43:27,961
Every soul that she ever milked...

474
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:29,852
was inside that suitcase.

475
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:34,134
So if those snakes got set free
and if they killed Ray,

476
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:38,941
the evil of countless souls
is inside of him right now...

477
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:43,033
possessing his body.

478
00:43:43,102 --> 00:43:46,136
You're really
starting to scare me, Cece.

479
00:43:46,975 --> 00:43:50,870
You said it yourself.
You saw his truck outside the cemetery.

480
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:55,765
Now his only instinct will be to kill
and to sacrifice to the dark loas.

481
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,774
Nobody's safe, Eden.

482
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:00,636
Nobody's safe.

483
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,399
Should we go now?

484
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:10,654
She's really out of it. I mean, she's saying
some weird stuff. I think she needs help.

485
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:14,103
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but there's no phone here.

486
00:44:14,176 --> 00:44:18,170
- Do you have your cell?
- Like we're gonna have reception here?

487
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:21,590
Listen. You guys need to go to my house,
get my mom and bring her here.

488
00:44:21,665 --> 00:44:23,902
Call the sheriff.
Make sure he gets here too.

489
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,272
What is going on, Eden?

490
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:28,607
I don't know, OK?
Just hurry.

491
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,846
I'll stay with Cece.

492
00:44:30,914 --> 00:44:32,605
Let's go.

493
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:34,590
Let's go.

494
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:48,538
- I sent Rachel and Ricky for help.
- You should've gone too.

495
00:44:48,611 --> 00:44:50,848
Grandma's dead.

I'm the only descendant left.
Ray Sawyer will come here.

497
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:59,514
He'll want me dead,
and he will kill anyone in his path.

- You need help, Cece.
- There is no help.

499

You saw Ray at the cemetery because
he needs a sacred place to worship.

500
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:14,685
Reaping the souls of all that he kills
is his only purpose now.

501
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:17,148
And he won't stop.

With the baka.

593
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:18,341
Grandma says it has power over the evil,
but without her, I don't know.

- It's impossible.
- No.

There has to be another way.

demilk him with a ritual or something?

- I can make a doll.
- A doll? What would that do?

603
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:53,412
The evil is inside Ray's body.
I can't stop that.

604
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:57,315
But maybe I can stop his body
long enough for us to get out of here.

605
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,685
- It's worth a try.
- Are you talking about a voodoo doll?

606
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:04,678
If I had something of Ray's,
like some hair or some clothing,

607
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,620
some actual part of him,
I could make a doll...

608
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:11,524
So who's gonna go outside
and pull a lock of hair?

609
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:18,510
- Will blood work?
- What are you talking about?

610
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:21,575
Sean's his son.
Ray's blood is running through him.

611
00:54:21,648 --> 00:54:24,037
That would work, right?

612
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:26,086
Blood works best.

You can't be serious.

- Trying to get us out of here.

617
00:54:42,257 --> 00:54:45,257
By doing what?!
Making a human voodoo doll?

618
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:48,712
- Eden, we can't do this.
- He's dead, OK?

619
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,468

- It's wrong.

- Kempelan. It's blessing powder.
