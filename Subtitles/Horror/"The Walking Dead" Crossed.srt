I'm not a scientist!

3
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:07,834
I knew I am a very good liar
and I wanted to survive.

4
00:00:10,837 --> 00:00:13,441
You know what's happening in here
and you let it happen.

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:17,230
The wards keep my officers happy.
You shouldn't see this as a sentence.

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,360
- Wait, wait!
- ***.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,637
Weget her back, we get her back!

8
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,695
What's it gonna take?
A lot?

9
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,644
They got guns, people...

10
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:29,186

it was good
you weren't here for it.

15

Then you stay.
I'll go.

23
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,874
I owe it to Carol.

24
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:55,377
We all owe Carol.

25
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,949
I owe her more.

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,487
All right.

27
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:36,098
We'll be back soon.

In less great news for GREATM,

50
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,869
we just scraped the bottom

Yeah.

58
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:12,024

No.

60
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,268
Should we get him to the church?

61
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,370
Moving him could make him worse.

62
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,473
What will make him better?

63
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,743
Waking up.

64
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,579

65

Take the bottle.

68

Don't do this, Abraham.

70

- Don't.

Well, what's next on the agenda?

75
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:42,001
At sundown we fire
a shot into the air.

76
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:43,971
Get two of them out on patrol.

77
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:48,276
Then once it's dark enough that the
rooftop spotter won't see us, we go.

78
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,281
<i>We cut the locks on one of the
stairways, take it to the fifth floor.</i>

79

<i>I open the door,</i>
<i>Daryl takes the guard out.</i>

How?

81
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:59,190
He slits his throat.

82
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,491
This is all about us doing this
quiet, keeping the upper hand.

83
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,759
<i>They're not expecting us.</i>

84
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,061
<i>From there, we fan out.</i>
<i>Knives and silenced weapons.</i>

85
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:10,497
We need to be fast.

86
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:14,098
Tyreese, Sasha, take them.

87
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,032
Daryl, you take care
of whoever is in the kitchen.

88
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,999
I got Dawn.

89
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:23,200
<i>If they're smart, the rest
of them will give up.</i>

90
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:24,701
<i>Then it'll be five on three.</i>

91
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:27,037
Six on three once we get
a weapon to Beth.

92
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,775
12 on three.
The wards will help.

93
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,715
That's best case.
What's worst case?

94
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:40,152
All it takes
is one of those cops

95
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:42,153
going down the hall
at the wrong time.

96
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:45,790
Then it's not quiet.
All hands on deck.

97
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,057
We're talking about a lot
of bullets flying around.

98
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,093
- If that's what it takes.
- It's not.

99
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,130
If we get a couple of her cops

100
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,734
alive out here,
we do an even trade.

101
00:09:56,736 --> 00:10:01,137
Theirs for ours.
Everybody goes home.

102
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,973
Yeah, I get it.

103
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,177
And it might work.

104
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,214
This<i> will</i> work.

105
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,521
Nah, that'll work, too.

106
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:18,192
You say this Dawn, she's just
trying to keep it together, right?

107
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,862
Trying and doing
are two different things.

108
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:23,928
You take two of her cops away,

109
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,731
what choices does she have?

110
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,932
Everybody goes home.

111
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:30,901
Like he says.

112
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,070
Pick one.

113
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,878
You need to learn
how to defend yourself.

114
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:56,349
We can teach you.

115
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:03,892
Defend myself?

116
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,063
They said they'd go.

117
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,799
Carl: <i>They were liars
and murderers.</i>

118
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,602
- Gabriel:<i> Just like us.</i>
-<i> We protected ourselves.</i>

119
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,839
They wanted us dead.

120
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:19,273
You're lucky your church
has lasted this long.

121
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:24,845
You can't stay
in one place anymore.

122
00:11:24,847 --> 00:11:27,646
<i>Not for too long.</i>

123
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:30,316
<i>And once you're out there,</i>

124
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,417
<i>you're gonna find trouble</i>
<i>you can't hide from.</i>

125
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,287
<i>You need to know how to fight.</i>

126
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,204
<i>Good choice.</i>

127
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,271
But you're not holding it right.

128
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,576
You've got to be able
to drive it down

129
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,613
'cause sometimes their skulls aren't
as soft and you need to be able--

133
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:08,097
I need to lie down.

134
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,304
Dawn:
<i>That's your plan, huh?</i>

135
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:19,305
O'Donnell: <i>Look, we are
doing everything we can.</i>

<i>Licari is out in the
sedan right now.</i>

137
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:23,443
<i>If there is a sign of Noah,</i>
<i>we are going to find him.</i>

138
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:27,615
You just told me that your plan
was counting on him screwing up.

139
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:31,588
(chuckles)
That's some active police work right there.

140
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:37,026
Was there anything else?

141
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:40,764
Yes, actually, there was.

142
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:43,968
The patient in exam room two,

143
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,005
she was half dead

144
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:49,239
She's not looking so good.

This ain't Pin the Tail
On the Donkey.

146
00:12:51,342 --> 00:12:54,579
Are we really gonna keep wasting
valuable resources on this lady?

147
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,481
How much electricity
does your DVD take?

148
00:12:57,483 --> 00:13:01,351
- Excuse me?
- We have very limited resources here.

149
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:03,019
You charge it every day.

150
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,855
- Are you kidding me?
- Beth.

151
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:09,725
- That woman has been here one day.
-<i> Beth.</i>

152
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:12,328
What good is this place if it
doesn't try to save people?

153
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,996
Turn off the machines.

154
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,037
Tell Edwards to take the
patient off of his rounds.

155
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,771
If she pulls through
on her own, then fine.

156
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:22,071
But you're right.
She's not worth the effort.

Tell him. Tell him you
changed your mind.

162

You don't know how fragile
this thing is.

163

There's nothing I can do.

164
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:53,786
So you'll just have to do it.

165
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,689
You're gonna save
that woman's life.

Edwards with this.

168
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,896
So take it.

I thought you were weak.

175
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,313

00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:40,325
Y'all go.
I'll stay here.

180
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,824
- You sure?
- I am.

181
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,431
Okay.

182
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,308
(walkers snarling)

183
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,195
Just stay here, guys.
Don't get up.

184
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:22,431
There is nothing
for you in Washington.

185
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,668
That's not funny.

186
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,337
It's not not not not funny.

187
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,874
Hey, I get that we're all dealing
with things in different ways--

188
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,944
Listen, I don't know what
to do without DC anymore,

189
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,180
but I'm not dealing with it.
I'm over it.

190
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,215
I just want him to be okay.

191
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,887
Eugene wasn't strong.
He isn't fast.

192
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,689
He doesn't know
how to use a weapon.

193
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,057
The truth hurts,
but he's useless.

194
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,360
He had one skill
that kept him living.

195
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,430
Are we supposed to be mad
at him 'cause he used it?

196
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,167
Damn right.

197
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,033
Get over yourself.

198
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:26,241
You're not the only one
who lost something today.

199
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:31,380
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

200
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:50,300
Beth.

201
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,233
Can I?

202
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,534
Yeah, sure.

203
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,376
The woman in exam room two,

204
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,614
what medicine
would you give her?

205
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:09,149
Dawn called it.

206
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,182
I know, but if you could,
what would you give her?

207
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:15,751
She was in a car accident.
She suffered internal injuries.

208
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,623
- It's just a guessing game.
- So guess.

209
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,995
You have the key.

210
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:26,230
Did you take it
or did she give it to you?

211
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:28,267
Because if she gave it to
you, she did not do it

212
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,569
out of the kindness
of her heart.

213
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:32,536
Don't. Just tell
me what medicine.

214
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,138
I was trying to save my life.

215
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,111
I'm still wondering if I did.

216
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,987
Epinephrine drip,
five milligrams.

217
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,092
She won't wake up right away,

218
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,793
but it'll ease her blood
pressure so she'll have a shot.

219
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,601
Hey.

220
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,105
Good luck.

221
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,378
(sighs)

222
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,914
Perfect.

223
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,018
You think it's any
clearer upstream?

224
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,953
<i>(fabric ripping)</i>

225
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:25,125
Probably not.

226
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,559
Doesn't matter.

227
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,228
Let me see.

228
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,871
Tara:<i> So, you just built a water
filter in about two minutes, huh?</i>

229
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,110
Eugene taught me.

230
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,413
Takes a while, but it'll be clear.
Then we can boil it.

231
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,985
Were you with Abraham
before it all happened?

232
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,985
No.

233
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,555
No, I was with other people
just trying to make it.

234
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,295
How'd you wind up together?

235
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,498
We crossed paths in Dallas.

236
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,333
Me and my group, we were
fighting off some dead ones

237
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,200
and he jumped in
from out of nowhere

238
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,333
with that big truck.

239
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,403
Rest in peace.

240
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,304
He had Eugene in the cab.

241
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,242
And afterwards, he told me that
he was trying to save the world.

242
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:20,676
And that he saw what I could do.

243
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,812
And he wanted my help.

244
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:28,017
He was the first person
to ask me for that

245
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,019
since this all started.

246
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,130
Maybe he was lying, too.

247
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,347
(splashes)

248
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,450
You see that?

249
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,385
Those ripples.

250
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:55,221
Those are fish.

251
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,692
Okay, how?

252
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:00,560
Come on.

253
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,061
Lamson:
<i>Shots were from over there.</i>

254
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,762
<i>I swear to God I heard it.</i>

255
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,399
-<i> (gunshots)</i>
-<i> There. There!</i>

256
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,805
- Put it down, Noah.
- Put the gun down.

257
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:24,640
<i>(car door closes)</i>

258
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:27,543
Hands up.
Turn around.

259
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:35,885
<i>(zip tie zings)</i>

260
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,787
You let me know
if it's too tight, okay?

261
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,758
I thought you were smart, Noah.
You think we wouldn't hear you?

262
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,597
Where are those rotters
you were shooting at?

263
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,234
(whistles)
Hands.

264
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,670
What do you want?

265
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:54,345
Whatever this is, we can help.

266
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:58,249
You do what we say,
we don't hurt you.

267
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:03,690
Okay.

268
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:09,062
Good.
Now turn around.

269
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,666
Put your guns on
the floor and kneel.

270
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,850
We need to talk.

271
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,053
There's water if you
need some and food.

272
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,992
Mind if I ask you something?

273
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:42,497
The way you talk...

274
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,332
the way you carry yourself...

275
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,701
were you a cop?

276
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,542
Believe it or not, I was, too.

277
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,679
That's Lamson.

278
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,546
He'll be down for this.

279
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,516
He's one of the good ones.

280
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,220
(tires squealing)

281
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:06,856

282
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,627

283
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:46,768

<i>(car door opens)</i>

00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:35,867
Okay.

291
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,134
You win, asshole.

292
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:55,059
Rick. Rick!

293
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:04,642
Rick, three is better than two.

294
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,147
Your friend, what's his name?

295
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:32,282
I need to talk to him. Your plan is
going to get me and my friends killed.

296
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:33,952
We're gonna make it work.

297
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:36,386
It would work if you had
different cops to trade.

298
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:40,158
<i>Dawn's running Grady</i>
<i>into the ground.</i>

299
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,128
A bunch of us want her out
and she knows it.

300
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,697
Pretty sure she knows we want
Lamson to replace her, too.

301
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,431
Dawn doesn't know that.

302
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,098
She might.

303
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,298
And she's smart.

304
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,103
So there's a good chance
you can't make this deal work

305
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,569
and that'll leave us all dead.

306
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,869
But if you let us go,

307
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,104
<i>we'll take care</i>
<i>of Dawn ourselves</i>

308
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:02,938
and then we'll let your
friends go and this is over.

309
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,975
No, we're not gonna do that.

- No.

I just need you
to shut up right now.

312
00:27:20,157 --> 00:27:21,990
You can make this work.

313
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,458
But you've got to be able
to talk to her.

314
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,361

<i>I've known her</i>

Phillips head.

Almost.

Almost.

- Now.
- (laughs)

333
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:00,691
- Hell, yes.
- It worked.

334
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,459
Nice.

335
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:03,894
You know how to clean
these things?

336
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:05,696
I know how to clean
these things.

337
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:07,561
Good, we're gonna need that.

- Good.
- Guys.

You, uh...

I already took the machete.
What more do you want from me?

355
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:13,487
I don't want anything from you.

356

00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,129
Thank you.

Here you go.
Come on.

360
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:22,719
- I can't-- I can't--
- You all right?

361
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:24,420
- I can't breathe.
- Get Edwards now.

362
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:26,721
- You, get a gurney.
- I got it.

Alvarado: <i>All right. Easy, easy.</i>

367

O'Donnell:
<i>Stay with me.</i>

368
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:45,573
Breathe.

369
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,575
- Breathe.

370
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,278
I-- I'm okay.

371
00:31:52,347 --> 00:31:54,884
I don't know what that was.
Thank you.

373
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,926
Carol.

374
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,464
It's Beth.

375
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:53,140
I just wanted you to know
that I was here.

<i>(clangs)</i>

380
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:34,270
I'm gonna say it
and you're gonna listen.

381
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:37,040
And then, when you're ready,
you let me help you.

382
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:41,145
You got to say good-bye.

383
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:45,847
He saw it.
He felt it.

384
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,183
And you hold onto
whatever you want to,

385
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:50,586
but I think you should
hold onto that.

386
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:58,490
I should have been able
to do it myself.

387
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:01,859
You could've.

388
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:04,528
But you let yourself feel it.

389
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,261
Kept your eyes open.

390
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,729
You let me help you.

391

00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:38,066
She'll tell you
she won't make a deal.

394
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:42,137
She'll tell you
she won't compromise.

395
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,172
But she will.

396
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:46,175
She always does.

397
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,147
Just-- just know
who you're talking to.

398
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:56,717
Probably heading out in
the next 10 minutes or so.

399
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,785
Anything you need
before we leave?

400
00:36:00,254 --> 00:36:02,388
Actually, water would be great.

401
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,463
Will do.

402
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,764
Thanks, Sergeant Lamson.

403
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,265
My name's Bob.

You're still a cop.

405
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:18,908
No.

406
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,177
No, the real ones are all gone.

Damn it.

412
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:42,660
I'll be okay.

413
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,798
Me, too.

414
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,968
<i>The parking lot,</i>

415
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,470
when you were bringing us back
up here I-- I saw a rotter.

416
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,738
I saw one of the rotters
and I knew him.

417
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:11,251
His name was Tyler.

418
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:14,188
I met him at Grady.

419
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,825
We were both sent there
when shit started going down.

420
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,061
It took two whole days
to evacuate everyone.

421
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:23,165
Didn't sleep.
We didn't eat.

422
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:28,035
But still, it was the two
best days of my life.

423
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:33,172
I was supposed to drive

424
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:35,774
the last van of survivors
to the zone

425
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,777
and Dawn pulled me off.

426
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:40,881
She wanted someone
she could really trust

427
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,783
and she put Tyler on it instead.

428
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:47,590
<i>These-- these people</i>
<i>were gonna all be evacuated.</i>

429
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,426
<i>I was really pissed.</i>

430
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,525
I saw him out there.

431
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,795
Stuck out there,
melted to the asphalt.

432
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:01,502
And all I could think was,

433
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:03,474
"That would have been me.

434
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,175
It would have been me.
He saved my life."

435
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,712
<i>He's been out there</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

436
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,615
<i>Like he's a part of the street.</i>

437
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:14,284
Some screwed up, endless joke.

438
00:39:17,717 --> 00:39:19,882
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

439
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:23,685
So let me help you.

440
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:28,693
Do you remember where he was?

441
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:34,197
Yeah, I-- I can
take you right to him.

442
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,501
We're not going out there,
but I'm a good shot.

443
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:39,238
Show me.

444
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:44,611
Okay.

445
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,081
South side of the building.

446
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,753
You can see him from in there.

447
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:16,280
You're thirsty.

448
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:18,014
Don't say you're not.

449
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,088
Did you want me to shoot you?

450
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,524
I thought I did.

451
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:41,097

You know, the more
I think about it,

458
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:19,829
maybe it wasn't completely

459
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:22,231

Don't even look at it.

You see him?

464
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:07,297
About 20 yards
right of the sedan.

465
00:42:10,504 --> 00:42:12,271
There's a half wall.

466
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:16,977
He's leaning against it.

467
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,319
I see him.

468
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,292
