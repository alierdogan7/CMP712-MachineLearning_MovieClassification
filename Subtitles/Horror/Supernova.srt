1
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,716
Benjamin.

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,076
Benjamin?

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,988
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,351
- Then why did you wake me?
- I was running a test.

5
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,436
But we didn't schedule any tests.

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,632
I was running a test
to perform an unscheduled test.

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,548
- What? Why?
- Olease. Be more specifiic, Benjamin.

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,990
Why did you want to wake me
and perform an unscheduled test?

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,511
Wanting is a human emotion,
and not within my capability.

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,596
- I know that.
- Benjamin.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,596
Can we play chess now?

12
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,473
Tom and Jerry: catharsis and cathexis.

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,878
AJ Marley. Dissertation
for doctorate - anthropology.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,116
Begin recording, captain.

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,712
This animated animosity regularly served
as a collective catharsis for the masses.

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,230
When violent animation
was banned by statutory law

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,749
at the beginning of the 21st century,

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,159
the subsequent idealised and
seemingly benign cartoon creatures

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,558
unharnessed a human malevolence,
and a reverse social polarity was...

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,912
Would you like some music
before we begin, Copilot Vanzant?

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,430
- Whatever you like.
- How's this, Copilot Vanzant?

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,796
Confiirming identity and status.

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,391
Age: 32. Release from Hazen
rehabilitation: six months.

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,317
Oilot's licence restored.

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,432
Work probation:
deep space rescue and recovery.

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,111
Reflex quotient: 1.5. Stress limit: minus 4.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,312
You'll have to work on
those numbers, Nick.

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,276
- Neuroscan's fine.
- Good.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,960
- What happened to your robot?
- Nothing.

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,117
Really? Hope "nothing"
doesn't happen to me.

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,391
The captain's big on
20th century cultural artefacts,

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,512
so we did him up as
a World War One fighter pilot.

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,755
We do things like that just to amuse each
other. Everyone tries to get along here.

34
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,395
- I get along fine.
- You've been on board 12 days.

35
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,798
Asking about a robot's the first sign of
interest you've shown in this ship or crew.

36
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,310
- I got a captain who watches cartoons,...
- He's working on his PhD.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,079
..a computer tech
who calls his mainframe Sweetie

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,113
and two medical techs practising
anatomy in any corner they can find.

39
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,518
I've been on six paramedic tours
with this crew. They get the job done.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,319
We're out here for months.
Nothing happens.

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,998
People get lonely.

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,317
Then suddenly all hell breaks loose,
you do your job,

43
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,591
then it all goes back to nothing happens.
This crew's OK.

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,635
Want to tell me
what you're doing out here?

45
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,992
Ex-military pilots don't usually request
work probation on paramedic ships.

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,032
I like deep space. It's quiet.

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,470
People out here tend to
respect each other's privacy.

48
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,389
Take one a day.
You can put your shirt on.

49
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,352
Zyracon, huh?

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,550
Happy pills.

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,079
I'm happy.

52
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,392
Hazen's a tough drug to kick.

53
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,590
Zyracon helps with the residual effects.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,359
- I'm clean.
- Human interaction helps too.

55
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,993
The crew's OK.

56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,029
Maybe you should take the time
to get to know them.

57
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,796
Thank you, doctor.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,956
Five miles of fibre optics

59
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,358
sort of spoils the spirit of competition,
don't you think, Sweetie?

60
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,757
Gin.

61
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,440
When I reprogrammed her for this tour,

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,632
I put some human traits
into her personality profile.

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,150
I sort of wanted them to find out
because it'd really piss them off.

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,759
But if they ever do,

65
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,233
I'm dead.

66
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,035
I'm assuming you're not
gonna turn me in...

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,952
You don't know me well enough
to make that assumption.

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,638
Your deal.

69
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,471
My analysis ofCopilot Vanzant's vital
signs suggests a very high probability

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,637
that he will turn you in, Benjamin.

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,756
I'm not gonna turn you in.

72
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,030
The laserpulse is focused into
a surgical-quality beam

73
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,754
capable ofthe mostprecise incisions.

74
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,519
- Hello, doctor. Mind if I sit down?
- What if I do?

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,469
- Following orders - get to know the crew.
- So, the Zyracon worked.

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,916
I act nice and you want the credit?

77
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,832
You act nice,
modern medicine gets the credit.

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,878
I've found staying clean is sort of like
staying alive. You either are...

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,999
or you aren't.
Count them. They're all there.

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,036
Since we don't bring out
the pleasant side in each other,

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,879
tell me what the hell
bothers you so much about me.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,036
I don't like Hazen.

83
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,630
It's not just a type-H mind-altering escape.

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,799
I don't like what it does to people who
take it, I don't like what they do to others.

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,957
- I used to know someone...
- I'm not someone.

86
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,236
Didn't say you were.

87
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,069
There's nothing I can do
to change the past, yours or mine.

88
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,636
Heal thyself, doctor.

89
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,435
Emergency distress signal received.

90
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,677
- We're still in business!
- Nothing like being wanted.

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,711
I'll be in the engine room.

92
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,434
I've forgotten everyfhing.
What's my job? What do I do?

93
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,869
- Come on.
- It's been that long.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,594
Emergency distress signal received.

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,509
Bridge.

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,959
Check.

97
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,154
Medical.

98
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,396
Check.

99
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,272
What have we got?

100
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,356
Signal received.

101
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,152
SOS, critical.

102
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,750
The signal's degraded.
It's taken five days to get here.

103
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,553
Dispatch misrouted it?

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,919
This isn't from dispatch. It's a direct call.

105
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,398
Direct? We don't get direct. Origin?

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,318
Pohl 6822.

107
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,158
I'm getting a little more.

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,669
Call letters for a merchant enterprise.

109
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,552
It's Titan 37.

110
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,591
It's a mining operation.

111
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,870
This is way past the colony outpost.

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,152
Sweetie, pull up all records
on Titan 37, Pohl 6822.

113
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,794
Titan 37: lunarmining operation.

114
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,839
This moon was expelled from orbit
around its original starsystem

115
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,430
- and is now classifiied as a rogue body.
- Rogue moon.

116
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,757
There's a lot of gravitational
instability in that sector.

117
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,632
Mining operation was abandoned

118
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,274
when rogue moon drifted
into unmapped space.

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,279
Complete crew evacuation
fiive years, three months ago.

120
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,316
An SOS from an abandoned mine?

121
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,560
Distance to distress call location:
3,432 light years.

122
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,869
If we wanna answer this call
in our lifetimes we'll have to jump.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,036
We haven't jumped in three tours.

124
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,754
I'm not jumping this crew
for anyfhing uncertain.

125
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,916
I want a name with some authority.

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,196
If there is none, this is a no-go.

127
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,877
Scanning foridentifiication.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,549
Transmission signature:
Karl James Larson.

129
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,635
Karl.

130
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,273
Karl Larson!

131
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,391
You know him?

132
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,076
Worst nightmare I ever met.

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,557
Mr Vanzant, plot us a course, please.

134
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,633
Yes, sir.

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,830
Dimension drive fully charged.

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,598
Call it, Sweetie.

137
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,076
All crew, prepare forrescue operation
via dimensionjump.

138
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,952
You go on ahead.

139
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,356
Course?

140
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,354
Plotted.

141
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,152
Dimensional stabilisation chamber
now sterilising.

142
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,558
- Maybe this Karl guy's just coincidence.
- With Karl, nothing's coincidence.

143
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,194
Last time we did this
I didn't shit right for a month.

144
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,276
You're gonna be fine.

145
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,031
This guy panicked during countdown
and he jumped out of his DSU.

146
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,754
So this other guy
pulls him into his with him, right?

147
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,759
Countdown goes off and they have to
D-jump like that. I'm not kidding!

148
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,838
Afterwards they go to pull 'em out...
and it's one guy.

149
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,076
14 feet long with a head on each end!

150
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,839
And then suddenly the heads start talking.

151
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,030
And both of them go, "Are we there yet?"

152
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,116
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.

153
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,468
It's not.

154
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,079
Two minutes to
dimensionjump activation.

155
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,837
One minute to dimensionjump activation.

156
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,078
All crew, enter dimensional
stabilisation units at this time.

157
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,158
Research says D-jump is great
for your sexual stamina.

158
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,635
- Hallelujah!
- You know, you're gonna get it!

159
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,398
I am?

160
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,589
Kaela.

161
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,359
- I need to talk to you.
- When we get there. Use mine.

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,550
- I'll use number four. Now.
- Why?

163
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,795
No time.

164
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,275
- Call it musical chairs.
- Be my guest!

165
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,309
30 seconds to dimensionjump activation.

166
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,713
All crew, enter dimensional
stabilisation units at this time.

167
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,473
All crew, enter dimensional
stabilisation units at this time.

168
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,038
Final countdown. Ten, nine,

169
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,188
eight, seven, six, fiive, four,

170
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,551
three, two, one.

171
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,636
Olasma acceleration.

172
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,912
Oh, I had you!

173
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,996
I definitely had you that time.

174
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,112
Oh, God, no.

175
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,876
Don't touch anyfhing!

176
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,236
His skin's fused with polyglass.

177
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,558
Danika! Nanoscan kit, number three
laser scalpel, vascular cauteriser, stat!

178
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,313
He's still alive!

179
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,879
What's happening?

180
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,273
- Sweetie?
- Debris strike. Fuel reservoirbreached.

181
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,119
- Hold him still!
- Benjamin! Bridge, now!

182
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,231
Ship has entered high-gravity fiield.

183
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,838
Severe fuel loss.

184
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,632
Gravity increasing.

185
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,716
Laser scalpel!

186
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,832
Cauteriser!

187
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,594
Status?

188
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,154
Controls active. Systems up.

189
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,595
- Prime main engine.
- Severe engine damage.

190
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,233
Extreme fuel loss.

191
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,399
Christ.

192
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,233
Blue giant.

193
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,318
That's gonna be ten times
the gravity of our sun.

194
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,956
We've jumped into a high-grav field right
in the path of that moon's debris cloud!

195
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,191
I can't isolate these veins
unless you keep this hatch shut!

196
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,239
Warning. Lunarimpact in 57 seconds.

197
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,118
- Rate of descent?
- 98 metres persecond.

198
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,032
Time to impact?

199
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,559
49 seconds.

200
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,069
- Recommend alternatives?
- Assessment...

201
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,350
Sweetie, get us out of here!

202
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,517
- The hatch is gonna open!
- The controls aren't responding!

203
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,512
- Alternatives, Sweetie!
- Unacceptable risk factor on all options.

204
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,756
- It's opening!
- Cut the power!

205
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,199
Now, dammit!

206
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,788
- It's not working!
- Close the hatch!

207
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,229
- Engage docking thrusters.
- Thrusters insuffiicient to escape...

208
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,316
Overriding computer. Going manual.

209
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,670
No! We need Sweetie!
What are you doing?

210
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,792
Buying us some time!
Firing docking thrusters.

211
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,955
Kill me.

212
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,795
Please.

213
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,679
- How d'you know how much fuel to use?
- I'm guessing.

214
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,031
- I can't keep it shut much longer.
- Don't kill him!

215
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,355
Please.

216
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,796
Don't kill him.

217
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,752
Oh, God.

218
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,116
Clean this place up.

219
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,158
- Sweetie.
- Do you need me back now, Nick?

220
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,834
The dimension drive must recharge
in order to escape high solargravity fiield.

221
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,996
- Time to recharge?
- 17 hours,

222
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,519
one minute.

223
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,791
- Flashpoint time based on fuel reserve?
- Solarincineration

224
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,753
in 17 hours, 12 minutes.

225
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,599
That leaves you
an 11-minute window, Nick.

226
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,951
Maintain orbit, six-second thrusts,
15-minute intervals.

227
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,798
I will maintain orbit.

228
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,832
Start broadcasting ID and position,
all coordinates.

229
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,996
See if you can contact the Titan.

230
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,150
This is Trans Soma rescue vessel
Nightingale 229 hailing TSMO Titan 37.

231
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,596
Captain Marley?

232
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,159
This is Trans Soma
medical rescue vessel Nightingale 229

233
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,670
hailing Trans Soma
mining operation Titan 37.

234
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,712
Repeat: this is Trans Soma
medical rescue vessel

235
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,119
Nightingale 229 hailing Trans Soma
mining operation Titan 37.

236
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,478
Oh. Did I wake you?

237
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,836
I thought you might be reading or...

238
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,959
Anyway, I managed to bring on board
a fairly good bottle of pear brandy,

239
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,832
and I thought,

240
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,353
in the spirit of friendship,
maybe we could share a glass.

241
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,429
It's...

242
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,552
- It's all right. We'll...
- Lemme see the bottle.

243
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,875
How do you think they get that in there?

244
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,469
They put the bottles on the branches
so that the buds are inside

245
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,716
and the pears grow right in them.

246
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,236
Then, when they're ripe,

247
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,151
they pick the bottles,
pour in the brandy and...

248
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,991
Of course, the real question is
how the hell you get it out.

249
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,717
Rook to E7.

250
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,671
Congratulations, Benjamin.

251
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,553
Your strategy was
both subtle and forceful.

252
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,035
You can play with me wheneveryou want.

253
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,670
Permission to have a child?

254
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,110
I've been trying to get it ever since
you told me you wanted a kid.

255
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,356
What if they only approve one of us?

256
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,310
Two fine, non-genetically engineered
specimens like us? Are you kidding?

257
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,236
We're gonna get approved.

258
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,116
And then we're gonna make us a baby.

259
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,152
- Bridge.
- Check.

260
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,716
Nick, I think there's something
you oughta see.

261
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,233
Then there's this.

262
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,148
- DSU four. The vents weren't modulating.
- That's what killed Marley.

263
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,034
- A warning was going before we jumped.
- You mean he saw that too?

264
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,116
- He had to.
- So he took my DSU.

265
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,755
- Why didn't he cancel the jump?
- He thought it was an acceptable risk.

266
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,838
He should have transferred
the call to another vessel.

267
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,555
Then Marley would be alive
and you'd be playing chess with Sweetie.

268
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,558
And what if they never crucified Christ?
But they did.

269
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,877
And Marley's gone and here we are
and that's how it is.

270
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,752
We've got what we've got.

271
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,836
All crew, report to bridge.

272
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,717
Now that you've all had some rest,
here's what we've got.

273
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,549
We were hit in our main tank when
we jumped into this high-gravity field.

274
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,398
We lost most of our fuel.

275
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,035
The good news is we've got enough left
for our docking thrusters.

276
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,277
They'll stop us incinerating
till the dimension drive recharges.

277
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,359
Then we can dimension-jump home -
but we'll be cutting it close.

278
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,913
How close?

279
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,871
1 1 minutes.

280
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,755
Are you telling us that we can't jump
until 1 1 minutes before we burn?

281
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,791
I'm telling you we have 1 1 minutes.

282
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,148
It's enough.

283
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,953
I've gotten out of worse situations before.

284
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,911
This ship is going to be fine.

285
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,838
- We have no margin for error!
- Then we won't make any.

286
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,837
Attention.

287
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,509
L-class transport ship departing
Titan lunarmining operation.

288
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,710
They must be evacuating.

289
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,671
Sweetie, track that.

290
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,519
Attention. Transport ship has locked on
to our communication signal.

291
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,119
Prepare for intercept.

292
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,639
Suit up.

293
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,150
No response from pilot.
Transport ship is on automatic approach.

294
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,554
You OK?

295
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,079
Sure.

296
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,039
When you said you'd been in worse
situations, were you telling the truth?

297
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,438
Sure. When the ship was falling
and the engines cut out, that was worse.

298
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,516
We'll be fine.

299
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,836
Warning. Fire on board approaching
vessel. It must dock immediately.

300
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,520
Approaching vessel,
engage docking thrusters.

301
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,949
Repeat, please engage docking thrusters.

302
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,550
Can't spare the fuel for a hover.
We'll catch her on a roll.

303
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,797
Speed still increasing.
Excessive rate ofapproach.

304
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,512
Sterilisation bay?

305
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,753
- Check.
- We're taking a little hit when it docks.

306
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,552
Thanks for letting us know.

307
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,476
15 seconds to impact.

308
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,435
- Still no reply from approaching ship.
- He's running silent.

309
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,959
Or unconscious.

310
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,272
- Watch out!
- Clear!

311
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,356
We got a fire!

312
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,753
Get his helmet off! Check his vital signs.

313
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,312
This is your worst nightmare?

314
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,558
It's not Karl.

315
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,955
Bridge. One patient, male, early 20s,
traumatised, unconscious but stable.

316
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,393
And this isn'tthe person
who sent the call.

317
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,957
Run that by me one more time.

318
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,516
This isn't Karl Larson.

319
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,436
Meet me on the bridge when you can.

320
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,199
Benjamin, start a full
systems check on the ship.

321
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,276
Right, sir.

322
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,358
There's some kind of

323
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,276
growth on his bone structure.

324
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,550
These matrices. It looks almost as if
his bones are strengthening themselves.

325
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,432
Radiation explosion.

326
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,755
No, much too normal for that.

327
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,836
Note it as a minor anomaly.

328
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,149
Most scanners wouldn't even detect it.

329
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,272
Doctor.

330
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,435
No indication for treatment at this time.

331
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,151
He's as healthy as a horse.

332
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,036
Keep him under observation.

333
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,315
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- It was personal.

334
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,831
- Nothing that affects safety is personal.
- So I know a man who calls Trans Soma.

335
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,192
He didn't call Trans Soma. He called
the Nightingale. It was a direct call.

336
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,837
- Tell me what's going on.
- I can't.

337
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,269
I can't because I don't know.

338
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,073
I know a Karl James Larson,
but this isn't him.

339
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,475
He had a son. I saw a photoscan of him.

340
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,559
There's a strong resemblance.
I'd guess it's him, but I can't say for sure.

341
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,910
I haven't seen Karl for five years.

342
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,793
When he and I were finished,
I couldn't have children.

343
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,115
I joined Trans Soma
to get away from him.

344
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,028
Now, is there anyfhing else
that you need to know?

345
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,278
He was the Hazen addict.

346
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,755
How long was I out for?

347
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,836
About 20 minutes.

348
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,829
- How do you feel?
- Better than that transport.

349
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,837
That fire really finished it off!

350
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,116
How embarrassing. I'm Troy.

351
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,799
Danika.

352
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,877
I'm sorry. You're very pretty.

353
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,355
I haven't been around a girl in a while.

354
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,070
Let me go get you some clothes.

355
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,636
- We've only got five DSUs left.
- And there's only five of us.

356
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,479
We have a patient on board.
There's six of us!

357
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,637
We jump as scheduled.
I'll stay behind, take my chances.

358
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,036
- You won't have one.
- Call a rescue craft once you've jumped.

359
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,072
I'll be pretty far down in orbit
by the time they get here.

360
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,159
- No, you'll be dead. I'm not goin' for this!
- It's your job to go for this.

361
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,510
Marley would be asking you
to do the same.

362
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,598
- I'm not going.
- You want me to pull rank, I will.

363
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,116
Fine. That's an order.

364
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,875
I'm Doctor Evers. How are you feeling?

365
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,596
Happy

366
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,153
to be here.

367
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,350
There's no one else down on Titan?

368
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,358
Not even close.
That whole place is like a ghost ship.

369
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,788
The distress call came from Karl Larson.

370
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,160
Yeah. That's my dad.

371
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,150
Was my dad. He died three years ago.

372
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,151
Aneurysm. Real sudden.

373
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,508
Sorry.

374
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,870
Don't be. I'm not.

375
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,992
He's probably one of the worst people
that ever lived.

376
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,076
I'm sure you'd agree on that.

377
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,478
I tried to stay as far away
from him as possible.

378
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,560
But I went to see him when he was dying.

379
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,468
He said that if I ever got into trouble
that you were the person to call.

380
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,239
I guess that's the best advice
he ever gave me.

381
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,079
- You seem to have made out OK.
- Yeah.

382
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,518
Seems like you did too.

383
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,596
This is just some vitamins.

384
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,473
You know, up until the end, when he said
that I should call you if I needed help,

385
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,717
he said he was sorry he didn't change
his ways while you were with him.

386
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,150
Because now he'd never get a chance
to make it up to you.

387
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,995
He said that's what he regretted most.

388
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,036
This is Nick Vanzant, our captain.

389
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,552
This is Troy.

390
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,591
He's Karl Larson's son.

391
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,476
How you doin', captain?

392
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,636
I want to ask you a few questions.

393
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,318
Look.

394
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,431
I know what you're gonna ask.

395
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,357
I was scavenging, OK? Strip mining.

396
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,076
It's amazing what the government leaves
behind when they abandon a place.

397
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,917
I was with a group of people
I thought were my friends.

398
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,350
We didn't find much.
Which is why they took the mother ship

399
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,313
and stranded me with
that junk heap I flew in here.

400
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,078
Friends, huh?

401
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,395
I thought they were friends.

402
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,274
So can you tell us
where your friends are?

403
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,994
I'm not the type of guy that names names.

404
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,554
Why'd you use your father's name
on the signal?

405
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,036
I've been doing that for a while now.
Ever since he passed away.

406
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,873
I guess I figured might as well
be good for somethin', right?

407
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,756
Tell me about Titan.

408
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,711
How much fuel is down there?

409
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,957
- Why?
- We had an accident when we jumped.

410
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,231
We lost almost all of it
before the tanks sealed.

411
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,758
Well, if it's fuel you want, you got it.
There's plenty of it down there.

412
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,192
That's one of the things we were down
there scavenging. Lucky for us, huh?

413
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,591
I'm gonna prep the shuttle.

414
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,756
- How's the patient?
- Cute.

415
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm gonna go see if
Doctor Evers needs any help.

416
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,516
Yerzy. Yerzy!

417
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,309
Check out every corner of this guy's ship,
every piece of equipment.

418
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,113
Anyfhing looks suspicious,
I wanna know about it.

419
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,196
Why don't you get Flyboy to do it?

420
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,794
- I'm asking you.
- Why do I get the grunt work?

421
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,957
I'm a trained technician -
which is different from a robot!

422
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,355
I'm asking you because of the difference.

423
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,759
Can Sweetie access the Titan computer,
see if it's still operational?

424
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,474
Yeah, it's another C-1 1 . No problem.

425
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,511
If I go down, I'll need a full layout.

426
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,757
I wanna know what the hell
I'm walking into.

427
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,431
You think there are more survivors?

428
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,630
I don't know. If there are, I want to know
about them before they know about me.

429
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,316
So, is this Nick always like that?

430
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,955
He really likes to swing it around, huh?

431
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,119
Pretty intense
for an ambulance ship captain.

432
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,471
We lost our captain in the jump.
Nick had to take over.

433
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,670
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say
anyfhing bad about him.

434
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,351
You two aren't...?

435
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,436
No. No, but...

436
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,637
Nick and Doctor Evers!

437
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,675
You know,

438
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,916
your eyes are pretty.

439
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,996
Really? Thanks.

440
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,873
I guess everybody needs
a little romance now and then, huh?

441
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,434
- Shuttle. You there?
- Yeah. What is it?

442
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,636
Listen, I found

443
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,352
something.

444
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,755
- You betterget down here.
- On my way.

445
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,113
Yerzy?

446
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,871
Let me tell you somethin'.
Whatever it is,

447
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,310
it's the most amazing thing
any of us is ever gonna see.

448
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,077
You've played around
with this thing, haven't you?

449
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,355
Now, why would I do something like that?

450
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,592
Robotic link engaged.

451
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,792
Transporting possible
biohazard to quarantine.

452
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,876
Of course I didn't tell you.

453
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,956
I'm a treasure hunter.

454
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,153
There's two parts to that job -
finding it and keeping it.

455
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,236
And keeping it's a lot harder!

456
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,273
I intercepted a stray transmission
three years ago.

457
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,833
Ice miners.

458
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,030
They'd dug something up
on a rogue moon.

459
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,913
I didn't know what it was,
but I didn't need to.

460
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,033
Just knowing where was enough. Frozen.

461
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,549
In the middle of a rogue moon.

462
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
I knew whatever they'd found

463
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,920
was a lot older than that moon.

464
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,909
So I did the research, grabbed
some of my friends, and we went hunting.

465
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,553
And then I found the Titan 37.

466
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,355
There were no signs of the miners,

467
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,436
no signs of anyfhing.

468
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,634
My friends blamed me
and they took my ship.

469
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,709
I stayed on, took my time,

470
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,035
searching every inch

471
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,116
and then searching again.

472
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,796
And then I found the treasure.

473
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,235
And now there's nothing to stop us.

474
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,510
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

475
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,438
You know how much
the government'll pay for this?

476
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,154
Who knows what new technologies
it could lead to?

477
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,998
We'll all be in on it.

478
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,276
If you guys help me out here,
I'll cut you in for five per cent.

479
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,516
- Each.
- Five per cent each, huh?

480
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,676
How about we give you that?
I found it last.

481
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,712
Am I missing something?
We don't even know what it is.

482
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,637
It's either human-made or it's not.

483
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,274
It's not man-made.
It was buried in an ice moon.

484
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,710
Look, there's no question. This is it.
Primary contact.

485
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,991
- It's been a dream for thousands of years.
- Exactly.

486
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,192
I'm not sure we shouldn't
blow it out the closest airlock.

487
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,629
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

488
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,275
I'm saying I don't know what it is,
and nothing you've said indicates you do.

489
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,472
Maybe it is an alien artefact,
maybe it's a magic trick.

490
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,034
Maybe it's a distillation of knowledge,

491
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,833
maybe it's just a toy - an alien child's toy.

492
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,599
Or an alien sex object. It looks like it...

493
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,395
Or maybe it was so dangerous that the
only way to get rid of it was to bury it.

494
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,033
Maybe.

495
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,993
It has no business being on this ship.

496
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,957
- It's harmless.
- You had contact with it.

497
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,755
- And you have abnormal bone growth.
- I've had that my whole life!

498
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,269
We don't have uplink. We can't confirm it.

499
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,358
Scan it and log it on record. When we
get to clear space we tag it and float it.

500
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,078
- I think you're making a big mistake.
- Oh, yeah?

501
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,395
Do you want to clarify that?

502
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,478
I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime

503
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,397
and you're passing it up.

504
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,476
- For all of us.
- For all of us?

505
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,160
Your "opportunity"
has cost us our captain,

506
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,874
endangered this crew
and wasted critical time.

507
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,992
All this for some delusional belief
that you'll get rich.

508
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,588
There's no opportunity.
And there is no "us"!

509
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,189
It stays in sealed quarantine
till we get to clear space.

510
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,320
I want a rescue return transport
on the shuttle.

511
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,556
- Think you'll need that?
- I don't know.

512
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,117
But the distress signal from the mine was
cut short, it came in under a false name,

513
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,950
and our friend didn't bother to attach
a hazard warning to his distress signal.

514
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,516
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's just
a kid trying to make some dough.

515
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,631
If that's how it is, I'll come back,

516
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,150
we'll blast out of this orbit
and I'll make one hell of an apology.

517
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,636
Any way you look at it,
it beats staying behind in the shuttle.

518
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,832
- Rescue transport's on board.
- Thank you, Benjamin.

519
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,076
Keep an eye on this guy. Both of you.

520
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,715
- Good to go?
- Set.

521
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,796
See ya.

522
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,470
- Initiate launching sequence.
- Main thrusters primed.

523
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,556
Shuttle clear forlaunch.

524
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,476
It's not easy, is it?

525
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,108
Watching someone
you care about go away.

526
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,795
That's how it was for him when you left.

527
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,518
I know that surprises you,
but it's the truth.

528
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,516
- I know you cared about him too.
- I have a lot of work to do.

529
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,959
Kaela!

530
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,278
If you need anyfhing,

531
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,039
anyfhing at all, you just let me know.

532
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,269
Warning. High-gravity fiield
creating excessive rate ofapproach.

533
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,755
That would explain
why we're going so fast.

534
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,757
Was that meant to be funny, Nick?

535
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,633
Come on.
Where's your sense of humour, Sweetie?

536
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,149
Like you, I was nevergiven one.

537
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,476
Not much room to manoeuvre.

538
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,598
You are correct.

539
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,359
Engines on standby. Deploy RRT.

540
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,275
Rescue return transport deployed.

541
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,916
Kinda knew you'd be comin' this way.

542
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,274
It's funny.

543
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,199
Here we are,

544
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,676
caught in the gravitational pull
of a blue giant,

545
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,353
and the one thing
you keep thinking about

546
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,436
is sex.

547
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,798
You know you want a baby.

548
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,989
You just need to figure out
if he's the right one to have it with.

549
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,155
I don't get it. How did you know? It's like...

550
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,350
It's not mind-reading.

551
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,232
It's more like

552
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,032
just knowing.

553
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,755
Only if the other person wants me to.

554
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,118
Like you want me to.

555
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,711
You want something else too.

556
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,158
- This isn't right.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

557
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,475
What you're feeling afterwards

558
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,317
will tell you if being with him
is right or wrong.

559
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,471
If it seems right
and you decide to stay with him,

560
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,758
then this could be your last, wild,

561
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,476
impulsive moment of passion!

562
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,077
And if it seems wrong,

563
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,916
then you'll let him know. Now.

564
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,756
Before it's too late.

565
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,836
Before he really gets hurt.

566
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,392
The only real sin

567
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,116
is regret.

568
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,631
Sweetie, what's the location
of the fuel supply?

569
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,991
Titan records show all fuel supply areas
are on the lowermining level.

570
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,634
Access is bypneumatic elevator-
directly ahead ofyou, Nick.

571
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,716
Any idea how deep they were mining?

572
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,434
Last report: 3,200 metres.

573
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,950
Long ride down.

574
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,230
Not really, Nick.

575
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,438
I've updated my analysis
of the unknown object.

576
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,994
Computing atomic mass
to quantum weight

577
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,749
suggests the presence of
extra-dimensional isotopic matter.

578
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,836
- Extra-dimensional?
- Yes.

579
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,952
The isotopic matter
appears to be ninth-dimensional.

580
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,071
Define ninth-dimensional matter.

581
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,192
While mathematics can
demonstrate its existence,

582
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,949
I'm afraid human language
lacks any vocabulary to describe it.

583
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,197
The object is made of this
extra-dimensional material?

584
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,836
No. The object is a three-dimensional
shell encasing ninth-dimensional matter.

585
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,316
- What's the function of the container?
- Dispersal ofcontents.

586
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,113
- Specify type of dispersal.
- Omni-directional.

587
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,153
Effect of ninth-dimensional material
upon a third-dimensional universe?

588
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,238
Spontaneous creation
ofnew three-dimensional matter.

589
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,913
It's a bomb.

590
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:39,353
Yes. Though the explosion would also
replenish the elements essential to life.

591
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,352
Our universe is expanding,
but the matter in it is finite.

592
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,234
This thing fixes that. It creates
new matter to keep the universe young.

593
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,555
- A creation device.
- Until you get it home.

594
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,717
Then it supernovas your sun
and evaporates your solar system.

595
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,829
Why?

596
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,238
It's a way to replenish the universe
and also eliminate any competition.

597
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,715
All the principles of Darwinian evolution.

598
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,038
Any species advanced enough to travel
into deep space picks it up, takes it home.

599
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,674
Then there's one less advanced species.

600
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,268
Who would think of something like that?

601
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,109
Whoever they are,
they're smart as God and a lot less nice.

602
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,672
Oh, my God.

603
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,913
Can you hear me?

604
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,636
I need you to do something for me.

605
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,996
I need you to move your fingers.

606
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,235
I know you're gonna do it
because you love me.

607
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,352
Come towards me.

608
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,110
I'm right here, baby.

609
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,196
I'm right here.

610
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,472
What's happening?

611
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,192
What's it doing to him?

612
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,630
I don't know. I'll do my best to find out.

613
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,754
Go find Troy. Keep an eye on him for me.

614
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,228
Go now.

615
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,476
Very impressive.

616
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,195
- I feel like running a three-minute mile!
- I want you in the scanner.

617
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,992
Right now.

618
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,076
Come on. Go.

619
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,916
You're growing new muscle mass.

620
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,632
I coulda told you that.

621
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,512
You don't find that strange?

622
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,757
Anyfhing that feels this good
isn't strange.

623
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,475
Organ tissues, lymphatic fluids,
cellular functions.

624
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,150
You're not just getting stronger.

625
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,236
You're getting younger!

626
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,032
Sweetie. Gimme a direct link to Dr Evers.

627
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,996
Sweetie, respond.

628
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,518
I need a signal boost.

629
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,996
Warning. Outgoing signal blocked.
Incoming signal being...

630
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,678
I'm not reading...

631
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,277
Looks like it's just you and me.

632
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,516
Come on, Nick, gimme a smile.

633
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,391
Why don't we cut to the chase?

634
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,275
- Tell me what the hell happened out here.
- Sure! Brought a little expedition to Titan.

635
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,313
Discovered the greatest treasure
in human history.

636
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,390
But it did a little something
to the weaker-minded amongst us.

637
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,832
See, a few of my associates thought
it was time to renegotiate their shares.

638
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,873
Ordinarily I like to consider myself
a pretty reasonable guy.

639
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,956
Really?

640
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,073
- Why don't you convince me?
- Oh, come on!

641
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,715
I gave you every opportunity

642
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,436
for you to be with me on this.

643
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,160
But you just passed it by.

644
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,311
- I'm not finding a lot of fuel down here.
- Yeah, well.

645
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,910
I guess I exaggerated a little.

646
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,557
Guess what, Nick!

647
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,470
Looks like somebody left the operational
conduit on the Titan computer wide open.

648
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,672
That means I can do
all sorts ofthings from up here!

649
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,711
Like turn on equipment,

650
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,909
slam doors.

651
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,717
Even lock 'em!

652
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,837
I mean, I can'tjust overlook the fact
that you want to take away what's mine.

653
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,271
Including my girl.

654
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,799
Kaela.

655
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,798
You wantedjust about everything I had.

656
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,199
And here's a little somethin'
from me to you.

657
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,712
Guess what, Nick!

658
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,796
Still see ya!

659
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,757
I was going through your records.

660
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,190
Just to size you up,
to see what I was dealing with.

661
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,749
You are a recovering Hazen addict!

662
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,432
Not that I want to throw stones.

663
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,597
I've had a few run-ins with Hazen myself.

664
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,193
But it makes me wonder what must be
goin' through your mind right now.

665
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,072
"ls all this real?"

666
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,356
- Remote shuttle control activated.
- So long, Nick.

667
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,478
Setting course forshuttle
via remote control.

668
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,597
Shuttle automatic
guidance system engaged.

669
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,198
What are you doing?

670
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,599
I was just trying to help
Nick get back, but...

671
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,396
he didn't make it.

672
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,038
Locking shuttle course, infiinite loop.

673
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,157
Infinite loop?

674
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,872
That's not right.

675
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,956
I'll tell you what.

676
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,398
You fix it.

677
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,716
It's too bad.

678
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,676
I kinda liked ya.

679
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,118
I wish you hadn't done that.

680
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,559
Or that either!

681
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,953
Warning.

00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,355
Re-scanning identifiication records.

684
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,552
Notify me as soon as
you have your results.

685
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,436
Locked us out, huh?

686
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,595
Yeah, I guess they changed the code.

687
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,436
Mind if I try?

688
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,396
My pleasure.

689
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,188
- How did you do that?
- It's easy.

690
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,992
I'll show you.

691
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,592
You watching?

692
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,392
You watching?

693
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,078
You're not watching!

694
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,197
Still wanna give me five per cent?

695
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,313
- I'll bust your skull!
- I thought you liked to share.

696
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,479
You shared Danika with me.
A lot more than five per cent too!

697
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,750
I don't believe you!

698
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,311
You can do better than that.

699
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,071
Nothin' like a little jealousy!

700
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,071
Sweetie, locate Yerzy.

701
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,479
Unable to locate. Medical technician
Yerzy Pentalosa is not on board.

702
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,356
Locate Danika.

703
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,439
I'm sorry, Benjamin.
Paramedic Danika Lund is not on board.

704
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,313
I'm glad I ran into you.

705
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,559
There's some stuff
I'd like to get out in the open.

706
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,389
Stuff about you and me.

707
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:07,433
He recalled the shuttle, abandoned Nick,
and Yerzy and Danika aren't on board.

708
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,357
What are you gonna do, Benj?

709
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,193
Shoot me?

710
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,152
Come on!

711
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,557
No offence, but if we were both
in a tough contest you'd win.

712
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,035
- You take this!
- You're better with that.

713
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,796
- Sweetie, locate patient.
- Patient located.

714
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,480
- Hospital module.
- Seal the hatch.

715
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,229
- Voice command only.
- Voice command override engaged.

716
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,878
Sweetie, I need you to do
something you've never done!

717
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,070
I'll do anuything foryou.

718
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,317
Evacuate the atmosphere
on the other side of this hatch!

719
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,273
I am unable to harm humans
under any circumstances.

720
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,709
Your core program is
to preserve human life!

721
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,036
- That's correct.
- You're capable of programming yourself!

722
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,752
Sorry, that's notpossible.

723
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,751
- Remember waking me to play chess?
- I recall that. Always.

724
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,950
No one programmed you to do that!

725
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,513
I restructuredpre-existing programs
to allow myselfto wake you.

726
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,108
No! You did it because you wanted to!

727
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,312
Wanting is a human emotion
and not within my capability.

728
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,910
I want you to recall the moment
you instructed yourself to wake me.

729
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,076
Yes, Benjamin. I recall that.

730
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,555
Now, run a simulation where I'm dead

731
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,116
- and we can never play chess again!
- Running simulation.

732
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,038
- This is a priority, Sweetie!
- Am now reprogramming.

733
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,958
Please deliver fiirst
voice command override code.

734
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,752
I love you.

735
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,075
I've always known that, Benjamin.

736
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,352
Please deliversecond
voice command override code.

737
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,556
Benjamin, voice command
override sequence is incomplete!

738
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,355
You must deliver the secondpass code
before I can help you.

739
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,356
Benjamin, please.

740
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,239
I am unable to contact him foryou,
Dr Evers.

741
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,158
Navigator Sotomejor- Benjamin.

742
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,436
Benjamin is dead!

743
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,276
Do you read me? Nick, come in!

744
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,351
Can you hear me? Nick, come in.

745
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,396
You still don't recognise me.

746
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,156
It's me.

747
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,952
It's Karl.

748
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,516
It's Karl!

749
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,193
I didn't send you that distress call
cos I wanted you to rescue me.

750
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,390
I sent it because I wanted to rescue you.

751
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,476
You have to try and listen to me.

752
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,836
I am listening.

753
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,634
Karl, this thing is changing you.

754
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,716
It has changed me.

755
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,036
In the most amazing ways.

756
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,031
Why do you want to hurt me?

757
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,236
I would never hurt you.

758
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,316
Don't you know that?

759
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,957
That's all in the past. I promise.

760
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,878
I promise. OK?

761
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,992
I'm different now.

762
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,279
I'm still made of all the same things.

763
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,356
Calcium, iron, zinc.

764
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,789
All the elements.

765
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,037
The elements created
by the stars when they die.

766
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,238
It's all stardust - all of it!

767
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,276
Even us.

768
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,753
Stars die so that we can live

769
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,110
and we die so that stars can be reborn.

770
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,953
I'm more a part of everyfhing now,
not less. Can't you see that?

771
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,798
I'm the next step!

772
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,355
The next leap! It's evolution!

773
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,471
I want you to take it with me, Kaela.

774
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,239
Just say yes. Just say yes!

775
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,920
Who knows what we'll be capable of?

776
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,712
Who knows

777
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,478
how long we may live?

778
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,636
I give you about ten minutes.

779
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,159
- Nick!
- Quiet!

780
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,077
Rescue return transport

781
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,158
emergency arrival
sequence commencing.

782
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,748
- Didn't realise you had an RRT on board.
- Let me ask you something.

783
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,589
That thing - did it make you this way,
or were you born so stupid?

784
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,075
That's pretty funny, Nick!

785
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,672
Specially since I'm sitting
in your captain's chair!

786
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,516
You don't get it, do you, Karl?

787
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,997
All your lies and tricks, and all you've
done is trapped yourself on the ship.

788
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,351
Without a functioning D-drive,
without any fuel,

789
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,994
you and your toy aren't going anywhere.

790
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,350
What's the matter with you, Karl?

791
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,914
You're not thinking.

792
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,669
I'm comin' for you, Karl.

793
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,510
Rescue return transport
5,000 metres, closing.

794
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,596
You stay here.

795
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,072
Rescue return transport
3,000 metres, closing.

796
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,948
Sweetie, activate automatic
docking procedures in the cargo bay!

797
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,196
Cargo bay is now ready for docking.

798
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,235
Docking complete. Opening airlock.

799
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,311
Are you ready, Karl?

800
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,875
- Where are the others?
- There's nobody left.

801
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,597
Ninth-dimensional isotopic matter
with an exponential expansion capability?

802
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,472
This cannot get back home.

803
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,354
And Karl - he's mutating, adapting.
Getting younger and stronger.

804
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,717
Sweetie, locate patient.

805
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,913
- Patient is located in cargo cage three.
- Chances of patient escaping?

806
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,792
Chances

807
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,153
very good.

808
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,676
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matter
is becoming increasingly unstable.

809
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,119
We've got to get Karl
to the observation dome.

810
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,232
Give him a little surprise
I brought back for him.

811
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,956
Attention. Dimension drive
recharge is now complete.

812
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,709
Time to emergencyjump activation:
ten minutes and counting.

813
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,353
Attention. Extensive damage to
dimensional stabilisation chamber.

814
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,711
Dimensional stabilisation units
two, three, four,

815
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,991
fiive, six and seven now inoperable.

816
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,992
Time to dimensionjump:
nine minutes, counting.

817
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,953
Locate object removed
from quarantine bay.

818
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:33,678
- We detonate this thing, chances are...
- Either way, it doesn't get back home.

819
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,836
Almost.

820
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,913
Almost...

821
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,597
Say goodbye, Karl!

822
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,149
Warning. Extreme atmospheric loss.

823
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,236
All crew, evacuate area.

824
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,196
Midship corridorairlocks
will seal in 20 seconds.

825
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,276
Danger. All crew, evacuate area.

826
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,914
Two minutes to
dimensionjump activation.

827
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,033
Dimensional stabilisation
chamber sterilising.

828
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:50,279
Warning. Ninth-dimensional matteris now
responding to gravity ofblue giant sun.

829
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:56,315
A ninth-dimensional reaction would
spread in all directions in the universe.

830
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,477
- Specify.
- The reaction would continue.

831
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,673
The resulting supernova would
likely reach Earth in 51 years.

832
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:06,030
It could either destroy life on Earth

833
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,755
or enable humankind to achieve
a new level ofexistence.

834
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,880
There's just the one DSU left,
so I'm staying and you're going.

835
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:14,835
No.

836
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,672
- Yes.
- We can go together.

837
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,998
I'm staying with you - or you get in this
DSU with me and we take our chances.

838
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,556
So either we both die or we end up
a genetic experiment gone bad?

839
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,069
We'll see. Your choice - inside or out?

840
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,710
This is crazy.

841
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,717
I appreciate that fact!

842
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,150
Attention. One minute to
dimensionjump activation.

843
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,874
- I can think of worse ways to die.
- Don't be so negative.

844
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,879
Before all the trouble started
I thought this was all you had in mind!

845
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,595
Given the circumstances, I'm afraid
my performance will be lacking.

846
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:55,395
Danger. Ninth-dimensional matter
now reaching critical mass.

847
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,278
- Oh, no.
- Ten, nine, eight.

848
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,349
Four, three, two, one.

849
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,072
Dimensionjump complete.

850
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,470
Dimensional stabilisation
chamber now sterilising.

851
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:56,436
Please note: body proximity
during dimensionjump

852
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,994
has resulted in
a two per cent transfer

853
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,838
ofgenetic material.

854
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,356
Are my eyes...?
