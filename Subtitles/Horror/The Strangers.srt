(playing country music on record player)

56
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:36,445
(singing) "...sad and lonely, and I wonder, do you remember me, everyday is sad and lonely...do you ever think of me my darling"....

57
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,961
You're my girl

58
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,040
(Loud knocking on door)

59
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:26,926

(more loud knocking)

61
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:55,227
-Hi 
 -Hello

62
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:10,834
-Is Tamara here 
 -No, you've got the wrong house

63
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:16,602
-You sure 
 -Yeah, I'm sorry

64
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:30,768
See you later

65
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:38,663
-That was weird 
 -Yeah, people get lost out here, should I go get her?

66
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:45,422
She seems OK, I mean, I think she would've said if she wasn't.

67
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:49,236
(whispering) It's cold outside

68
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:04,817

69
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:25,967
-I'm out of cigarettes 
 -I'll go get you some more

70
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:36,317
-No, I didn't mean that, you don't have to, just go to sleep, I'm tired anyway 
 -I know you want em'

71
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,752
-I'll drive 
 -It's alright, I want to drive for awhile anyway

72
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:46,827
Let me light you a fire

73
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:09,792
-I was thinking when you were taking a bath, I want you to take the car back tomorrow 
 -What do you mean?

74
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:17,628
I don't think a roadtrip is such a good idea right now.  I called Mike, he's gonna come out get me in the morning.

75
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:25,589
Are you sure that's what you want?

76
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,714
Yeah....

77
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:44,094
Okay, I'll be back, ...if you want, we could talk some more, you don't have to, OK?

78
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:53,667
-You gonna be OK here?  Yeah, I'll be fine

82
00:20:54,676 --> 00:20:56,909
Hello

84
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:21,111

(more loud knocking)

92
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:15,052
James, where are you?  That girl came back.  That girl!, I mean, she keeps, she keeps knocking on the door.

93
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,429
What do you mean, I heard her voice

94
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,397
No, I didn't open the door.

95
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:28,968
I don't know, the battery's dead, I'm charging it right now.

96
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,824
Ok, ok

97
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:34,414

98
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:41,134
No, I'm fine, just hurry.

99
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,384

Ok

101
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:50,006
Will you just stay on the phone with me?

102
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,096
(phone disconnects)

103
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,146
James?

104
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:16,737
(door closes)

105
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:23,065
(scared) James?!

106
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,324

107
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:55,830
(Knocking at door)

108
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:08,651
This isn't happening, this isn't happening

109
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:54,726

113
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:57,225
(loud knocking and banging, record continues to skip)

114
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,013

(record still skipping) "it's over dead"

116
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:52,938
(record stops, footsteps towards bedroom)

117
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,361
-Jamie!

118
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,784
-There's someone out there

-Don't leave me, Please don't leave me 
 Stop, stop stop. What happened to your hand?

120
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,686
Stop, stop, come here, come here sit down.  Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down

121
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,442
-How do you know there's somebody out there? 
 -I saw a man at the back door, and he's wearing a mask

00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:59,718
There's no one out here, nobody, come here..

127
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,734
Come here...

128
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:10,197
It's ok, there's nothing here

129
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,963
-So what do you wanna do 
 -I don't know

130
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:25,729
Kristen..

131
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:32,744
Kristen, what is it

132
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,747
She's watching us

133
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,810
-She looks like a ghost,

134
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:50,359
-Want me to go talk to her?  -They don't want to talk  -Well, They want something
people don't just stand there staring at us like that, they want something

135
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:57,554
-Shit..  -what? -I left my phone in the car,
I'm gonna go get it -You can't go out there!

136
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:03,076
-Why? 
 -One of them came in here and took my phone.

137
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,648
Kristen, nobody came in here...

138
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,398
She's gone

139
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:35,073
Fuck...

140
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:29,084
Shit...

141
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:48,179
(Loud bangs)

142
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:06,380
What do you want?

143
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:11,168
Why don't you get the fuck outta here

144
00:36:13,456 --> 00:36:17,244
-James!? 
 -Kristen, go back inside

145
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,719
-What's happening? 
-Kristen....

146
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:25,663
Kristen, Go...

147
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:55,500
-Jesus Christ!.. 
 What?  Sorry, I'm waiting for you

148
00:37:56,315 --> 00:38:03,093
-I want you to get your things, put your shoes on. Did you find your phone?  -No!
I told you they took my phone -I put it in your bag.. -James, it's not in the bag

149
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,562
I plugged it into the wall,

150
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,927
and when I came back, it was gone

151
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:10,153
I just, I don't understand, I checked the whole house, there's nobody in here.

152
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:13,466
Let me see your hand..

153
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,966
What are you thinking..?

154
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:29,641
It's since we've been here, I haven't heard a dog park, not a car pass.  Nothing.

155
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,808
Just us and "them"

156
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:39,431
-Why are they doing this? 
 -Listen, I don't want you to think about that OK?

157
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,808
Don't think about it..

158
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,777
It doesn't matter right now.

159
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,485
The only reason is if they'd come through that door..Ok?

160
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:17,853
-What is it? 
 -It's my phone, we gotta get out of here..

161
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:43,883
-Shit!  -Who is
that?  -I don't know

162
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:48,649
(engine reving)

163
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:54,463
Get out of the car..!

164
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:56,525
Oh!

165
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,146
Shit!

166
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,946
Come on!

167
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,228
(engine reving)

168
